<p> Increasingly consumers are paying more for prescription drugs . From 1981 to 1991 , prescription drug prices increased 88% , almost three times the general inflation rate and almost twice as fast as price increases in the rest of the medical industry . <p> For certain drugs , the price increases have been even greater . The General Accounting Office surveyed prices of 29 popular drugs and found that , for some , prices more than doubled over the sixyear period ending in 1991 . The average wholesale price of Geigy Pharmaceuticals ' Lopressor , a heart and blood pressure medication , for instance , increased from $204.66 per 1,000 tablets in 1985 to $448.55 at the end of 1991 . <p> This all becomes more dramatic when you consider that , during the 60s and 70s , pharmaceutical prices held steady or actually fell relative to inflation ; consumers essentially paid less and less for prescriptions ( see chart next page ) . <p> News of the recent price hikes has been eliciting charges by lawmakers and interest groups of price gouging and profiteering . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose price controls on the pharmaceutical industry earlier this year ( but was ultimately unsuccessful on the Senate floor ) . And President-elect Bill Clinton pledged during the campaign to " crack down " on pharmaceutical companies for their high prices . <p> The burden to consumers , however , is more than just increasing out-of-pocket expenses . The tremendous growth of " third party " insurance coverage has gradually been eroding consumer control over drug prices since the mid-60s . In 1966 , third party payers covered only 8.7% of prescription drug expenditures . Today third parties pick up more than 43% of such expenditures . <p> With this growth in third-party coverage , insurers-both public and private-and health maintenance organizations have removed the ability of more and more consumers to address the drugprice problem . As in other segments of the health care market , those who pay for health care services determine what and how many services are available . For prescription drugs , third-party insurers have turned to using restrictive drug formularies lists of drugs insurance plans consider eligible for reimbursement . Naturally , a key criterion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newer , more expensive , and potentially more effective medications are often kept off such lists . <p> Such actions inevitably limit the choice and supply of products available to consumers-as is the case with any price-control or third-party rationing system-without addressing the underlying cause of the problem , which is an extensive network of federal and state regulation of prescription drugs . <p> These regulations serve not only to increase the cost of making drugs and to punish innovation in the marketplace , but also to remove choice and power from the consumer , primarily by restricting the information available to purchasers . The net effect of federal regulations , state advertising and marketing restrictions , as well as third party control over payments for drugs , has been to increase costs to consumers , and reduce the number of new drugs available to them . <p> The Price of Regulation <p> The pharmaceutical industry , which consists of more than 100 firms ( with the largest by sales volume capturing just a little more than 7% of the market ) , claims that drug prices merely reflect ever-increasing costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pass on to the consumer . <p> The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) must approve virtually everything about a drug before it can be sold , from the safety and effectiveness of its chemical formulation to the advertising associated with it . This extensive regulation , stemming from a 1962 law  --  known as the Kefauver-Harris Amendments  --  which required that new drugs be found " effective " as well as safe , requires pharmaceutical manufacturing companies to conduct extensive lab and animal tests , as well as clinical human studies . <p> This research burden has added significantly to the cost of producing and developing drugs . For example , in 1963 , before the law was fully implemented , the cost and time to bring a new drug to market were about $29 million and 21/2 years , respectively . By 1990 , the drug approval process was costing $231 million and taking 12 years on average for each new drug that was approved , according to a study by Joseph DiMasi , Ph.D. , and others at the Center for the Study of Drug Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 91/2 years-is spent on research and clinical trials , with the remainder taken by the FDA itself in reviewing the company 's work . <p> This decade-plus lead time acts as a significant barrier to the introduction of new drugs , which helps reduce consumer options in the marketplace . The extent of this can be seen in the dramatic dropoff in the number of new drugs being introduced after enactment of the 1962 law . For example , the industry introduced more than three times as many new drugs a year on average before passage of the 1962 law as after-some 54 a year before to 16 after , according to Henry Grabowski , professor of health economics at Duke University . <p> In addition , much of the contraction occurred among competitor drugs . Grabowski found that the average number of new salts and esters  --  slightly modified versions of previously marketed drugs  --  dropped from 12 to 2 a year . Also , in 1968 , the FDA ruled that " me too " or " copy cat " drugs  --  which , because they were modified versions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer regulations-would become subject to the same safety and effectiveness requirements as new , so-called innovator drugs . <p> As if slowing down the introduction of new and competitive drugs were n't enough , the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments also removed drugs already on the market-because , according to the FDA , they were not " effective " ( despite thousands of testimonials from then-practicing physicians to the contrary ) . By May 1972 , the FDA had issued orders withdrawing almost half of the existing drugs on the market , or 1,925 of the estimated 4,000 drugs then being sold . Of these , 1,473 were competitors to existing drugs ( only 452 were innovator drugs ) . <p> Diversity in the marketplace was dealt another setback in 1979 when the FDA  --  in an attempt to speed up the approval process  --  adopted a classification system of new drugs based on the significance of the therapeutic advance the drugs represented . Drugs the FDA deemed a major " gain " received expedited review , while " modest gains " and " no gain " compounds , which included all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these drugs to reach the market at a slower rate than innovator drugs . <p> To address the resulting slowdown in the drug marketplace , Congress passed a law in 1984 streamlining the regulations on introducing generic drugs-chemically identical to existing drugs , but with different inert ingredients . ( Generics , although competitors to existing drugs , differ from copycat compounds because copycats differ chemically albeit slightly from innovator drugs , while generics do not . ) Companies may sell generics when an existing drug goes off patent , representing a significant source of competition to existing drugs . And this competition is having its effect on prices . This year prices have increased at just over 3% , compared to 7.9% last year . <p> But the flood of generics to the market and the threat of competition may have induced drug companies to boost their prices on patented drugs to make up for the expected loss of market share to generics when the drugs go off patent . <p> A patent on any new invention , including drugs , represents a government-granted , temporary monopoly on that product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses to invent new goods and products . But because the drug regs drastically reduce the marketing time for patented drugs  --  a patent is granted for 17 years , but a drug company typically has only five years remaining under the drug 's patent by the time it is allowed to sell it  --  drug companies must attempt to recoup their costs as quickly as possible . <p> Because development of a new drug takes so long and costs hundreds of millions of dollars-including research costs on many projects that do n't pan out as well as those that do-diluting property rights on successful drugs and restricting returns from marketing creates strong incentives against innovation . It becomes increasingly likely that pharmaceutical companies will stick with what 's already out there , rather than ploughing untold sums into new developments . <p> This has been borne out by the experience in Canada 's pharmaceutical industry since 1969 . The federal government there essentially mandated generic competition when an innovator drug is first introduced to the market . Result : Only three new drugs were introduced in Canada from 1969 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . <p> There is thus a threat that the 1984 generic drug law will lead to even fewer innovations in prescription drugs in the United States , as more companies devote more of their resources to generics . This past year , five pharmaceutical industry leaders , including Merck and Upjohn , announced they were moving into producing generic drugs , to take advantage of the streamlined regulations on these compounds . <p> Poor Consumer Information <p> While the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments prevent drugs from reaching consumers quickly and help quell innovation , another provision in the law prevents consumers from learning what 's available to them . This provision requires that drug companies include in their advertising a " brief summary " of the drug 's chemical make-up , what medical condition it addresses and possible side effects . This would appear to enhance the information flow . Under FDA regs , though , this brief summary has expanded to take up more than half the space in drug ads . Because this advertising costs money , companies rarely direct their marketing directly to consumers , but rather to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " brief summary . " <p> Companies may advertise a drug without the brief summary , but not if the ad contains the drug name and the condition it addresses . Consider recent ads for the " patch " for smokers . The makers of these nicotine transdermal systems do not include in the ads that these patches are to help smokers stop smoking . If they did , they would be required to include the brief summary in the ad . <p> " The regulations prevent ( most ) prescription drugs from appearing on television , the source of most information to many consumers . They increase the cost of print ads that trigger the requirement for a brief summary , and thereby reduce the number of such ads , " says Dr. Paul Rubin , economics professor at Emory University . " Ads that are written so as not to require the brief summary are less informative since they can not mention both the condition and the drug . Thus , the regulations cause consumers of pharmaceuticals to be less well informed than they would be with more sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Consumer Ignorance , " CR , June 1992 . ) <p> Without full information about the availability , attributes , and prices of drugs , consumers must depend on doctors for drug information . Of course doctors generally keep up on the scientific aspects of prescription drugs , and decide which drugs are appropriate . But , because physicians are not actually paying for drugs , they are sometimes uninformed about drug prices . <p> A 1989 survey of physicians ' knowledge of prices conducted by the University of Georgia 's Department of Pharmacy Care Administration revealed 82% of the physicians responding said " they needed more drug cost information than they currently received . " In fact , more than 50% of the physicians said they " frequently " rely on patients for drug price information , more so than on pharmacists , drug company representatives and other doctors . <p> State laws compound these problems by prohibiting pharmacies from mentioning the price of prescription drugs . Pharmacists , who lobby for such regulations , contend that price shopping by consumers would threaten their health because filling prescriptions at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , a 1976 study found that state price advertising regulation keeps prices to consumers higher . Then Assistant Professor of Marketing John Cady of the University of Arizona compared prices and services at pharmacies in states with restrictive regulations and in states without . He discovered that regulations boosted drug prices by 5.2% and service levels generally were n't any higher in regulated states . <p> Cady did discover that fewer pharmacies offer prescription monitoring services in unregulated states-37% in unregulated versus 47% in regulated . All other services , such as delivery and emergency services , were offered as much if not more in unregulated states . He concluded : " The results indicate that the regulation of prescription drug price advertising , promulgated and defended by organizations representing retail pharmacists , appears to benefit pharmacists only . Service levels , with one . exception , are no higher in states regulating advertising than in nonregulating states . " <p> In addition , other state laws drastically reduce the ability of consumers to obtain lower drug prices from mail-order pharmacies . According to a study released by the Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrict the ability of mail-order pharmacies to operate by requiring an in-state license . <p> " But mail-service firms keep their costs low by serving national populations centrally , " noted HIAA Vice President Anthony Masso . " Compliance with diverse state licensing requirements would increase the operating costs of mail-service pharmacies and narrow the cost advantage they offer in comparison to community pharmacies . " <p> Consumers Losing Control <p> The growing trend toward third-party payment in the prescription drug marketplace all but guarantees continued high prices . Consumers normally exert tremendous control over prices . But when someone else-a third party-pays the bills , costs skyrocket . That 's because consumers , whose out-of-pocket costs are small or nonexistent under third-party payment , such as private health insurance , have less concern with price . A 1992 report by the Employee Benefits Research Institute ( EBRI ) reveals that third parties are increasingly picking up the tab for prescription drugs . These third parties in 1989 paid for more than 40%  --  or $12.3 billion of the prescription drug expenditures in this country , up from just 8.7% , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1966 . <p> Conversely , the proportion of prescription drug expenditures paid by consumers out-of-pocket has declined dramatically , from 91.3% in 1966 to 57% in 1989 . In other words , the market influence of consumers has been greatly reduced . <p> The skyrocketing costs of drugs have led third parties to adopt cost-containment programs , some of which ironically have the effect of keeping prices high . Two deserve discussion here . <p> The first involves the use of drug formularies , or lists of drugs approved by insurance companies and/or government for reimbursement . Currently , some 15% of prescriptions are covered by formularies , which leave the consumer little choice in selecting a preferred drug if it 's not included in the formulary . <p> Duke Professor Grabowski , who studied " Medicaid Patients ' Access to New Drugs " for the winter 1988 Health Affairs , discovered that when state Medicaid formularies are restrictive , new drugs take as long as four years in some states to be included on the formulary . <p> This lag also means that pharmaceutical companies must turn to other buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formularies , as well as other buyers , pay higher prices . <p> The trend toward formularies is projected to increase . " By the year 2000 , most pharmacy purchases will be made by committees rather than individual physicians prescribing for patients , " Alan Hill of the University of Pennsylvania 's Leonard Davis Institute told The Wall Street Journal . <p> Again , the effect of this approach is to penalize and inhibit innovation . As the Journal notes , SmithKline Beecham says it " will halt internal basic research for new ulcer drugs , long one of its major therapeutic areas , even though its Tagamet remedy is the second-leading seller in a $5 billion world-wide market . The decision ... recognizes that from now on , new drugs will fail commercially if they offer only marginal benefits over existing treatments , especially considering that low-priced generic versions of products like Tagamet will be on the market soon . " <p> Another cost-containment strategy that has helped boost prices is indirect price controls imposed by the Medicaid program . In the budget act of 1990 , Congress required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to be listed on state Medicaid formularies . These discounts and rebates were pegged to a company 's " best price " offered to other volume buyers . <p> As the EBRI report points out , under this mandatory discount provision , " pharmaceutical companies now have an incentive to limit discounts from the ( average wholesale price ) to other payers in order to increase their best price to Medicaid . As a result , other payers who rely on discounted providers such as mail-order drug companies or HMO and hospital formularies to contain their drug costs might find that they are paying higher prices . " These " other payers " get their money from consumers . <p> Necessary Reforms <p> Clearly , price controls and other third-party , cost-containment schemes are not the answer to the problem of high prescription drug prices . These steps remove the consumer even further from any ability to influence the market . Restoring consumer purchasing power , however , could come about by removing the regulatory hurdles from the drug approval process . This would go a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs . <p> In recognizing this , the FDA-at the urging of Vice-President Dan Quayle 's Council on Competitiveness-recently began taking steps to streamline the drug approval process , which should help reduce the time it takes to get new drugs to patients , and therefore costs . <p> These steps include a more flexible standard of effectiveness , which will require the FDA to consider the health risks of delaying approval of a new drug , accelerating reviews of drugs that treat life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases , and accepting results from clinical studies on new drugs in certain other countries . But with the upcoming change in administrations and the fact that these changes are still being formalized , the extent and effect of the reforms remain to be seen . <p> A more drastic overhaul of the regulatory process has been advanced by Prof. Grabowski and others , namely to remove the FDA from its role in pre-approving new drugs . In other words , ending the safety , effectiveness , and advertising regulatory apparatuses currently existing . Grabowski suggests that , instead , the FDA would act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consumers would have reasonably ready access . A well-functioning tort system to provide consumers legal recourse would be crucial to such a reform , Grabowski notes . <p> At the state level , legislatures should repeal all price advertising restrictions on prescription drugs . These restrictions make it difficult for consumers to shop for the best price and therefore insulate pharmacists from such price competition . <p> Finally , the growing trend toward third-party coverage of prescription drugs should be reversed . While consumers may initially believe they are " getting a better deal " when an insurance company pays for drugs , the inevitable cost-containment schemes that follow will mean less choice for consumers , with potentially unhealthy results . <p> As with so many other programs and laws adopted in the name of consumers , the federal and state regulations on prescription drugs , as well as the increasing third-party coverage of drugs , have actually ended up hurting consumers . Successful reforms must address the underlying causes of soaring drug prices-a heavy regulatory burden which restricts innovation , reduces options , and limits information to consumers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will produce further shortages of competing drugs , but rather to reduce this burden . The FDA has taken some encouraging , if tentative , steps in this direction . But unless and until more power is restored to consumers , they will remain on the short end of the stick . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> GRAPH : Prescription Drug Prices , Health Care , and Inflation <p> By Chris Warden <p> <p> Mr. Warden , a contributing editor of CR , is editor of the National Journalism Center . <p>
