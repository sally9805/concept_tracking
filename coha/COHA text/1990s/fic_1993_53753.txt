In the first week of the last month of the semester , a new young inmate came into the classroom , took a seat , and watched the teacher with sharp eyes . Soon he was involved with discussions  --  even wrote essays , original stuff , quick  --  zipped them off , so smart . Sharp , and charming , good-looking yet warm , yet an edge of violence . Soon embroiled in one of those classroom stews , where everybody speaks , yells , shouts , demands , implores , and teacher helpless , let it go , to witness and enjoy it : that afternoon loud and fervent on their neighborhoods and what who wanted to be most or  --  something , life 's ambition not often clear in these debates , but of a sudden the new fellow 's voice rose , and took command . So compelling teacher lost sense of the classroom , they were on a street corner , and he listened to this vivid tale of woe , told with verve , wit , and sparkle , in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that street that goes up a hill overlooking the river , near the academy ? " <p> " Oh yes , " teacher smiled , glancing at the other guys , seated in their desks , listening . Smiling . Eager . <p> " That 's where I saw her car ! " cried the youth . " You know , those trees along the sidewalk ? " <p> Guys nodded . <p> " Yes . " Teacher . <p> " Well , that 's where I saw her car , parked . I knew her car . " <p> " Okay . " <p> Knowing something was coming , teacher looked at the guys , and grinned . They , too . Grinned . <p> " In front of his house , " he said , bending a little , being slender , and small , as if to stretch himself longer , tense in anger and laughter , excited : eyes wide , pupils floating . Arms outstretched , fingers spread  --  " His house ! The guy she was in love with ! He was a cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , wild , " she wanted to be a cop , she wanted to be a cop , and  --  " <p> " Was parked in front of his house , " teacher said , lips in a smile . Eyes not . <p> " Yeah ! Because he was a cop ! I saw her car . I know her car , and it was there , under the tree on the hill in front of the house where the cop lived ! " <p> And a couple of weeks later , shook hands in that room , and said goodbye . . . the end of the last class before graduation ceremonies . . . sad , to say farewell . Teacher gave him his address saying keep in touch , sure ! Sure ! Knowing he never would and he was right , for the youth did not , but why , in truth , should he ? Aside from the fact he had come into teacher 's poetry class , and teacher had paid attention to him , what did that say , or do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was responding to the car under the trees on the hill . That was the image , the poetic image , and the story without a plot told by an uneducated but talented , very intelligent , very angry , and perhaps too insecure youth , in a passing two or three classes , in the School Block , in a House of Detention for Men , in a big city somewhere , anywhere in America , a country where saying goodbye was tough , it hurt , but it was said more often that saying hello , and getting more and more the thing to do , the way things were going . <p> Teacher stood there , facing the empty chairs , in the empty classroom , looking out the dirty windows at the dry , gray weedy dirt between the cell blocks , under a low , even dirtier sky . He had to learn to let these guys go . He had to let them go where they would , wherever it was , because he was not the essential . <p> True . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them go like that infuriated him  --  he knew he was not the essential , home and family were but letting them go as if to the winds infuriated him because he remembered them all , thus they were memorable , and they were in the notes he kept , so they were in his way of him . This anger was in his eyes , in the set , determined expression of his lips , and across his face which caused certain prison guards to look twice at him , with murder in their longing eyes , because he hated them , and held them in contempt . Thus he wore his face in mask , so they looked at him and saw no one . A deception teaching in prisons had taught him , and he had learned , fast . <p> <p> <p> By FIELDING DAWSON <p>
