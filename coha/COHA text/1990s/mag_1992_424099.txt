In an Arizona suburb , Marcus Bollinger creates a striking garden in the sun <p> To many gardeners , the arid climate of Paradise Valley , Arizona , a suburb of Phoenix , seems as far from paradise as one could imagine . Though winter temperatures hover around 65 degrees Fahrenheit and offer a pleasant respite from the ice , snow , and bitter winds that torment other parts of the country , summer temperatures can quickly reach a scorching 105 degrees , with the area 's seven inches of annual rainfall offering little in the way of relief . But for those who love warmth and the subtle beauties of the Sonoran desert , the valley is aptly named , and offers as many gardening opportunities as places blessed with more moderate temperatures and greater supplies of water . <p> The key to success in this climate ( USDA Zone 9 ) , says landscape architect Marcus Bollinger , of the Scottsdale firm Landscaping by Andre , is to look to the desert for inspiration . " The obvious solution is right in front of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they are . When I first came here from Louisiana 15 years ago , I was doing green plantings , and I hated it . I saw my pittosporums burning , and everything looked like a disaster . It took me two or three years to figure out what to do ; now I know that if you use desert plants , you can make it work . You really have to live in the desert awhile to understand how to garden here . " <p> Evidence of just how much Bollinger has learned is clearly visible in a garden he designed in the valley in 1990 . He was asked to create a landscape that would screen a new , pueblo-style house from the road and give it a settled look . The project actually began during construction of the house : As many mature cacti , trees , and shrubs as possible were either left in place or moved to the safety of a temporary nursery . From there , Bollinger and his clients worked together to develop a concept for the gardens . <p> Traditional landscaping notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We really wanted to throw away the idea of a front yard and a backyard , " Bollinger says , " and create an environment around the house instead . " As a result , the front yard consists of gently banked paths that thread their way through a series of desert-inspired vignettes , some original to the site , others carefully planned and planted . A graceful littleleaf palo verde ( Cercidium microphylla ) , its bright-green trunk and dense , spiny branches stretching gently over a large boulder , stands in a pool of pink Mexican primrose ( Oeneothera berlandieri ) . Groups of golden barrel cacti ( Echinocactus grusonii ) and native giant barrels ( Echinocactus species ) emerge from beneath the squiggly , protective branches of creosote bushes , while an aged saguaro towers over the vaselike form of an ocotillo ; the stout , forked trunk of a mature Yucca elata ; and the mounded leaves of a large desert spoon ( Dasylirion wheeleri ) . <p> Because of their strong architectural nature , these plants are of interest throughout the year , though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Starting in March , the creosote bushes are covered with tiny , clear-yellow blossoms that eventually turn to fluffy balls of white ; the ocotillo sports crimson chevrons on top of each of its narrow stems ; and the palo verdes and mesquites hide their branches in a froth of mustardy gold . Calliandra californica , the fairy-duster bush , offers up delicate powder-puffs of red , while Aloe saponaria throws spikes of tubular , orange-red flowers that are the delight of hummingbirds . A little later , the cacti come to the fore  --  the saguaro bearing clean-white bouquets of blossoms , the barrels bright crowns of yellow or pink , both of which develop into brightly colored , egg-shaped fruits as the season progresses . <p> The effect here is one of walking through a manicured bit of wilderness , with desert vegetation dispersed among carefully placed boulders , earth that is gently mounded to help catch and retain water , and a tidy , half-inch-thick mulch of decomposed granite . As Bollinger notes , its spare , open feeling may not appeal to everyone . " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this space between the plants ? ' Except for the wintertime when the native grasses fill in , this is the way the desert looks . The desert is n't covered with foliage ; its beauty is in its skeletal part  --  the mountain formations , the color and texture of the earth , the stones , and the way the stones are positioned . So it 's really important to contour the earth , to interrupt it with boulders , to play with those elements that we already have going for us . It 's very different from having English ivy and aegopodium and pachysandra growing all over the ground . " <p> To reach the front door , visitors pass through a lovely wrought-iron gate and enter a cool and inviting courtyard . The courtyard is enclosed by a low , curving adobe wall that also defines an intimate palm and cactus garden . Though palms are not native to Arizona , Bollinger 's clients love their airy forms , and Bollinger has found them useful in connecting the property to those surrounding it . To one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer yard are two sinuous Mexican fan palms ( Washingtonia robusta ) , with Mediterranean fan palms ( Chamaerops humilis ) gathered at their base . On the other side of the mesquite , skirting the edges of several large boulders , is an intricate arrangement of cacti . Backing the sturdy branches of an organpipe ( Stenocereus thurberi ) and several young , barrel-like saguaros are the spiraling blue-green columns of Cereus peruvianus and its more tortured-looking form , Monstrosus ' . A mixture of spiny , softball-size Easter lily cacti ( Echinopsis species ) that bear beautiful white , peach , rose , or lavender flowers , nestle in the crevice between the boulders . <p> The choice of cacti was based , Bollinger says , on their similarities of form and color . " I think you have to cluster cacti  --  they need to be in groups and families . It took me a long time to develop a style of planting that makes them feel stable . Everything here is vertical and somewhat rounded , with a variety of textures , colors , needle sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though they had just washed in and around the rocks , the same way water washes plants and animals onto a reef . " In other parts of the border the colors of the cactus are repeated in the slender , blue-green fronds of a desert spoon ( Dasylirion wheeleri ) , whose shape in turn is echoed in the thick , black-tipped rosettes of Agave parryi and the artichokelike A. victoriae-reginae , whose blunt , deep-green foliage is edged in white . <p> Just across from the " reef " is a reminder of the true nature of the desert  --  another boulder , slightly hollowed , that catches rain as it drips down from the roof . This way the owners can tell whenever it rains and celebrate the little water they get . The birds appreciate it as well , and find an extra bit of shelter in the windmill palm ( Trachycarpus fortunei ) that softens one edge of the rock . <p> Another respite from the desert sun can be found to the east side of the house , on a small tiled patio just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prosopis velutina ) screens the view of the house next door and offers a welcome spot of shade . It also presides over a rounded , irrigated planting area filled with a changing display of cheerful annuals and large terra-cotta pots of geraniums . Balancing the mesquite to the right of the patio are several palms salvaged from the site during construction : three lanky Washingtonia filifera , native to California but also found along remote streambeds in Arizona , and the shorter , more exotic Mexican blue palm ( Brahea armata ) , whose wide glaucous fans pick up the blue-gray foliage of the Texas ranger ( Leucophyllum frutescens ) hedge that trims the property . Whenever the air is especially humid , Bollinger says , the hedge responds by covering itself in a haze of lavender blossoms . <p> Continuing along the path to the back of the house , past more palms and a stunning specimen palo brea tree ( Cercidium praecox ) , you enter a small grove of fruit trees planted not only to provide oranges , grapefruits , lemons , and limes , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though the trees are still young , they will eventually hide one of two stone-lined retention ponds at the rear of the property , where excess water collects during the winter and summer rainy seasons and can be used by the surrounding trees . <p> Just beyond the grove , visitors enter an arched gateway into another world : an adobe-walled backyard where strategically located ironwood trees ( Olneya tesota )  --  their gnarled trunks and glaucous foliage reminiscent of the olive trees that once occupied the site  --  provide pools of shade . Plantings of cacti , succulents , and palms are integrated by a narrow strip of lawn and the same curving flagstone paths that traverse the front and sides of the property . <p> The central feature of the backyard is a freeform swimming pool studded with boulders and islands of exotic-looking plants . A small waterfall at one end of the pool is nestled into a surprising colony of aptly named totem-pole cactus ( Lophocereus schotti forma obesa ) , whose tall , knobby green columns catch and distort light and shadow . " This cactus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " Bollinger says enthusiastically . " It 's spineless , for one , and it takes on the form of some sort of creature or stalactite . These things can also get really large  --  about 12 feet on an average . " This particular planting is not irrigated , so Bollinger gives the totems an occasional watering during the height of their summer growth period . In response , the plants are plump and healthy and have grown about a foot a year . At their feet are groups of perfectly round golden barrels , and for contrast here and there , the reedlike leaves of Yucca parviflora . When this yucca blooms , it sends up striking , vibrant-orange stems with red-orange flowers , another favorite with the hummingbirds . <p> Set in the lawn to the west of the totems is a wizened old ironwood that Bollinger and his clients are especially fond of . " It 's got such tremendous character , " Bollinger notes . " When we discovered this tree , we were n't looking for perfection . Its trunk is like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story . It makes me wonder what happened to make this big limb break off . And it has created a beautiful canopy here . " In late spring , the ironwood 's hoary limbs are dressed with pealike lavender blossoms ; beneath them , Mexican primroses and aloes intertwine . <p> Bollinger believes that the structure of desert gardens should come from the placement of significant trees and boulders . " Once we put the ironwood in , " he recalls , " I saw the gate beyond it , and that it made good sense to integrate what was going on between the two with cactus . I think the creation of an environment begins with one large plant . Once you put that in it will dictate a lot of what 's going to occur around it . " The border along the back wall , therefore , features rhythmic groupings of boulders , cactus , and palms in between the ironwoods , with the trees ' branches and foliage softening the more severe forms of the cactus . Starting from the west , one finds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Mexican cousins ( C. robusta ) , which extend their arms at an earlier age than their kin . Fronting the saguaro are the bluish columns of Cereus peruvianus and a sprinkling of golden barrels , which continue down the border past an organpipe cactus and a Mexican blue palm before reaching the palo verde and ironwood trees that frame a comfortable sitting area . In the remaining stretch of border , opposite another ironwood , a cluster of Cereus peruvianus and C.p . Monstrosus ' intermingle , reflecting the grouping of cactus at the opposite end on a smaller and slightly varied scale . <p> As in the front courtyard , Bollinger has treated the plants as though they were sculptures , arranging each to play off the other 's colors , shapes , and textures . He has also positioned them so they will cast intricate shadows along the wall . " The light in Arizona is intense , " he explains , " so when you play it on a sculptural shape like that of a cactus , you have a heightened experience of plants . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an environment where the foliage is lusher . " <p> The size the plants attain was also important to the design . " We decided to use a lot of large cactus here , " Bollinger says , " because when the plants are really large , the garden goes beyond anyone 's imagination of a dish garden ; it gets a life of its own . What we 're looking for is to have these things grow together and become monumental . It 's something humans have an emotional response to . And I think that 's what 's going to occur  --  these cactus are going to create a cactus forest ; they 're going to be something to reckon with . <p> Transplanting cactus is not a simple task , Bollinger says , spines notwithstanding . Saguaro and barrel cactus , for instance , have shallow root systems and can easily dehydrate if they do n't get enough moisture . However , they are also susceptible to rot , so it is difficult to determine whether or not to water them and to tell how much water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of saguaro , so Bollinger prefers to plant younger ones , ranging in height from three to eight feet . " We almost never lose one this size , " he notes , " and it 's something you can really look at . Most people do n't have a chance to look down on a saguaro unless they are out in the desert . " <p> Ironically , another hazard of transplanting cactus is sunburn . Though some believe this is n't a problem if you position the plant the same way it was growing originally , Bollinger points out that the plant may once have been protected by its neighbors or may now be receiving additional light reflected from a wall . This puts extra stress on the plant when it 's trying to reestablish its root system . To ease the transition , Bollinger uses a trick he learned from an arborist , which is spraying transplants with Snow . The product looks much like powdered sunscreen until it eventually wears off , by which time the plant is usually acclimated to its new home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lose their foliage after transplanting , the sun can burn their trunks , " he explains . " It 's a great aid , a lifesaver really . " <p> For saguaro , house-hunting birds pose yet another hazard . " The birds ' habitat has been damaged , so any saguaro we plant here is going to be attacked the day it arrives , " Bollinger says . " It 's OK if it 's a single-family residence , but if it turns into a condominium complex , you 've got trouble . They 'll carve out a hole called a boot , which gets woody as the cactus tries to heal itself . If it heals over , it 's not a problem , but the birds can just pulverize some of them , and if they bring in a virus , it can kill the plant . If you fill the holes with cement , they just dig another one . People have tried everything to stop them  --  Brillo pads , moth balls , rubber snakes . The snakes work for about a day , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure you have to let them go . " <p> Maintenance for the garden is minimal , as water and fertilizer are provided by a computer-controlled irrigation system , set up in zones to deliver the proper amount of moisture and nutrients to individual planting areas . Each area is arranged to hold plants with similar needs ; those with the highest water requirements , such as annuals , are located closest to the house . Additional maintenance consists of raking , an occasional pruning , and , when necessary , spraying for fungus . Pests do n't pose much of a problem here . " With the native plants , birds will eat the insects , or if the plants are unhealthy , they will produce their seed and then die , " Bollinger says . " We always try to extend the life of a plant , but if something is n't doing so well , we just let it go . It 's only when you get into exotics rather than natives that you have to bring in the chemicals . " <p> To Bollinger , this type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the desert , unlike many of the landscapes in Paradise Valley . " We wanted to do something that spoke of the desert , " he says emphatically . " This is a garden about the undomesticated kind of plant life . It 's the unexplored , the unconquered , which I think we have to learn a lot more about . The tame and the untamed can work together . And it 's incredible how much wildlife can live in a city if you create the right environment for it . I think that 's a really key thing because not everyone can afford to live in a remote area . But we can recreate that environment . And by bringing it to us , we can keep from destroying more of the desert . " As if in testimony to this , a pair of foxes recently moved into one of the drain pipes at the back of the house and proceeded to raise a family . <p> This , however , does not mean that the garden does n't have virtues as a garden , though for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower best suited to other parts of the country . " I do n't like it when I hear clients say We want a cottage garden and we 're willing to replace things year after year to have one , ' " Bollinger states firmly . " I want to see an event occur in the garden , not a replanting . I want to see this yucca getting bigger and stronger and better , and to watch an arm grow on a Mexican saguaro . I can come to this garden in the heat of the summer when it 's just unbearable and see everything flourishing . Then I know that this is right . The plants are celebrating the elements that overwhelmed us . They speak for themselves . " <p> And for a gardener , that is the most important element of paradise .
