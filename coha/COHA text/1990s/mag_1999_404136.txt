Dinty was resting beside his kennel . The sun was bright , and even in the cold Antarctic , when the wind is blowing , it is comfortable for Husky dogs in the sunshine . Dinty was a lead dog with Admiral Byrd 's expedition . In fact , he was the best and most dearly loved of all the dogs in the pack . He was not very big , but he was stocky and strong . His coat was solid black and it shone and glistened in the sun like silk . His legs were marked white as high as his knees , making him look for all the world as though he were wearing white stockings . And his broad chest was marked white also , while his great bushy tail curved over his back like a plume . His face was very wide and the fur on it so thick that you could scarcely see his eyes . But when you did look into them , you found that they were beautiful eyes . They were deep brown in color , and were grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Dinty was full of mischief . He loved to play tricks on his masternothing serious or harmful of course-and his driver loved that spirit in him . When they would finish their little game , whatever it might be , and Dinty would snuggle his cool , soft nose into his master 's hand and look up at him , no driver in the world could do anything but forgive him for his harmless tricks . Dinty had just come in the night before from a hard two weeks ' trip on the trail . Leading his own team and accompanied by five other sled teams , each consisting of nine dogs , they had gone out in the same direction as the South Pole . In a few days now Admiral Byrd would fly in that direction , and these teams had carried food and supplies and left them in little snow houses every fifty miles or so . Then , in case the airplane had engine trouble and had to land , the men could always have food nearby It had been a very hard trip for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice , dragging heavily loaded sleds for days and days , and it had been bitter cold all during the trip , sometimes fifty below zero . But the dogs had done a wonderful job ; everyone in camp was very proud of them . The dogs were happy to be back for a good rest , also just a bit proud of themselves , which of course they had every right to be . The last day 's march had been a record-breaker , covering over sixty miles . Dinty led the teams in as he had led them out , with tails waving and snow flying from their tireless feet . As they swung down the little hill that led into camp , the men in camp set up a great cheer for both the dogs and the drivers . And so Dinty , with another splendid job finished , was enjoying a good rest . He had been fed all the rich seal meat that he could eat , and it was so good to lie and doze in the comfortable protection of his kennel , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no worries about being harnessed and driven over the cold barrier for a few days at least . Just to see him stretch as he half awakened made one feel how good it is to stretch when one is drowsy and does not have to worry about work . He lay there on his side and pushed his back into a great arch , sticking his four feet straight out as though he were trying to push away from something . Then he sighed happily and began dreaming again , perhaps this time of the blinding storms he had been in or the long , weary miles he had traveled with heavy loads . Whatever his dreams may have been , they were now rudely interrupted by a tiny cyclone of fur , accompanied by squealing and yipping and comical attempts at barking , as six fat little puppies of all shapes and sizes tumbled upon him with a rush . Trotting behind them came Dell , their mother , a pretty little gray Eskimo dog , not as large as Dinty , and the most gentle , loving little dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Dinty 's side as she curled up beside him . " I am so sorry that they disturbed you , Dinty , " she said , " but they just this minute found out that you were home from the trail and , of course , nothing would do but they must come over and see you at once . At this time , the little fellows were acting as though they were trying to tear Dinty into small pieces . There was Sunshine , so named because he was coal black , tugging away for all he was worth at one ear . At the same time Danny , Spinner , and Scott , three bundles of different-colored fur , had decided that their little teeth would be able to gnaw through the heavy fur around the big sled dog 's neck . They were simply falling over each other in their efforts to get at him , growling terribly all the while . The two little girls of the family , Holly and Jill , were busy all this time with his bushy tail . They would crouch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though they were really vicious , and then spring at the waving plume , only to miss and tumble into the snow squealing and grunting . They were rapidly becoming frantic in their efforts to capture the swaying tormentor . Dinty let them play for a while , really enjoying it as much as they were . Then he shifted himself into a more comfortable position with his head resting against Dell 's side . " Well , it certainly is nice to be able to rest once more , " he said . " But then good hard work never hurt any dog . I am so glad just to be living and enjoying everything and , most of all , to be down here in the Antarctic with Admiral Byrd and his men . I do n't much like to think of the day when we must pack up and go home . Why , do you know , I never had any idea that being on an expedition was such fun . Way back in Labrador when I was pulling the mail sled , together with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and truer friends no dog ever had ) , and they came and got us and put us on a ship with a lot of other dogs and brought us down here , I thought it would be the same old thing every day-work , work , work , without ever anything to change the order of things or break the monotony . Spinner ! You rascal , stop biting my ear . " The puppy 's little teeth slipped off Dinty 's silky ear just then , and he sat down with a thud , looking very much surprised . Then with a yip he crawled to his feet , and sprawled among the others in a heap between the older dog 's paws . When the squirming mass before him quieted a bit , Dinty went on with his story " Down here there is always something different and new . Of course we work hard , but so do the men and it 's good for all of us . The drivers are so kind to us . They feed us well and play with us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , you never know from one day to the next what sort of excitement you will find . " Just the other day , right here in camp , a very thrilling thing took place . I was lying here by my kennel and saw it all and I tell you that it was a long time before the fur on my neck would lay down again-it had stood on end so long . " The puppies stirred a bit and then were quiet . Dell pressed a little closer to Dinty and sighed contentedly . The dog continued , " It was all on account of that big Siberian leader , Hasty , and you mark my word that fellow is going to come to a bad end , if he does not pay more attention to his driver and quit thinking he knows more than his master does . I tell you , Dell , a dog simply must do as his master commands him , no matter what it is , because there are lots of things that we do not understand . The driver always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learns that the better it will be for him . But I think Mr. Hasty has learned his lesson , as he was very quiet on our last trip . But just listen to what happened on that day . " Hasty was leading his team into camp about noontime . The sled was light and they were going at a good pace . The rest of us had finished our morning 's work and were resting , and I remember seeing Hasty 's team come over that rise yonder trotting down the slope . It was a pretty sight , the dogs all about the same size and color swinging along at an easy trot , with their master calling and singing to them to cheer them along and let them know that camp and rest were near . " Now you all know about those big machines that Admiral Byrd has brought down here . Airplanes , I think they call them . They have been kept under the snow all winter , just as our kennels were , so that the men could work on them when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men were bringing one of the machines out of its winter house to the surface of the barrier . Hasty , seeing a group of men busy about something , thought he would go over and investigate . His pace quickened until he was going at a pretty fast clip . The driver shouted for him to stop , but Hasty paid no attention . Faster and faster he ran until the team was just racing along . Then his master shouted , Gee , ' and Haw , ' the commands used to turn the lead dog to the right or left , but it was no good . Hasty had made up his mind that he was going to see what was going on and nothing could stop him . He did not know what his driver had seen . That huge steel blade-propeller , I think it is called-attached to the front of the machine was whirling around so fast you could scarcely see it and Hasty was tearing along into what would mean a sure death for all of them . Nearer and nearer they raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver could not head them off , and they started to wave their arms excitedly in an effort to stop them . Closer and closer the dogs came , so close in fact that the cries of the driver could not be heard above the roar of the engine . Suddenly , just as they were about ten feet from the blade , the figure of a man could be seen diving through the air straight as an arrow , crashing like a thunderbolt right into Hasty , slamming him to the ice with an awful bang and piling up the rest of the team-almost directly under the spinning blade . " The driver came up and pulled the dogs back out of danger . Then he gave Hasty a good licking which he surely deserved . For a long time after that Hasty was not allowed to lead his team . I think by now he has learned his lesson , for he never did one thing wrong on our last trip . But it just goes to show that something exciting is liable to happen any day down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail and waddled over in front of him . She tilted her head to one side as she looked up into the older dog 's face , for Dinty was her very greatest hero and she wanted to hear every word he said . She squeezed her way in among the other pups who growled and complained at that young lady 's intrusion but she paid not the least attention to them and soon they were all quiet again . " I guess it is because there is always something new going on down here that we do n't mind the hard work , " Dinty went on . " But there was a time just the other day on the trail when I was awfully glad that we had worked hard and trained well , for if we had not been in the very best of condition , our whole team , and even our driver , would be at the bottom of a crevasse right this minute . I get nervous even now when I think of it . " We had been driving all day with heavy loads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ice . These cracks are called crevasses and some of them are fifty or a hundred feet wide and are invisible because they are bridged over with just a thin layer of snow . " Well , we had just one more to go over . In fact , the other teams had crossed and pulled up on the barrier about a mile and started to make camp . I led out over this last crevasse and reached the solid ice on the other side . Moody and Watch and the next two dogs were over , when-crack-the whole bridge fell through with an awful roar . The sled , driver , and four dogs were dangling iri that hole with just five of us dogs holding them ! " The strain was terrible . We dug our claws into the ice and held for all we were worth , but it did not seem possible to be able to save them . And just when I thought that we would have to let go and get dragged into the crevasse with them , I made one lunge-forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long drives and hard training , for as I moved forward , the others did also . Where we got our strength from I do n't know , but inch by inch we clawed our way ahead . We were awfully tired before this accident and now were just about exhausted . We made one last lunge to go forward , using just about all the strength that we had left . Then there was a sudden slackening of the strain that had been holding us . It released us so quickly that we sprawled ahead , unable to stop . But the sled was up and all were saved . " I tell you , though , it had scared us so bad that , tired as we were , we started to run and never stopped until we reached camp where the others were . Our driver was very happy that night and gave us a big double supper , and before he went to bed he came out and played with us all for a long time . " At this point Dinty 's story-telling was interrupted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knelt beside Dinty and held the dog 's fine head between his hands . " Sorry , old fellow , " he said in a kindly voice , " but we have to do a little work . The boss wants us to go down on the bay and bring back some fresh meat for supper . We 'll do it , wo n't we , Dinty ? " He thumped the sleek side affectionately and Dinty 's heart pounded with joy and love for his master . A few minutes later and they were hitched , and with a cheery cry of " Mush , " Dinty raced off at the head of his team , the snow flying from their racing feet . Six sad little puppies , sitting in a row on the hill , watched their father disappear . For a long time they watched , and then , sure that he would be back to tell them more exciting stories , they went back to their playing . <p>                  @ @ @
