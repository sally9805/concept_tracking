We have a seven-week-old filly who 's an orphan . She has n't eaten since her mother died five days ago of a twisted gut . The baby wo n't take a bottle with a goat 's or calf 's nipple on it . Yesterday I tried squirting mare 's milk substitute into her mouth with a kitchen baster . It trickled out all over me and the stable floor . On one of the stall 's rails Marsh has hung black plastic buckets just large enough for a foal 's head , each of them filled with different food-foal pellets , oatmeal mixed with corn meal , some other strange mixture . Her mother was a gentle ten-year-old Marsh called Belle . We thought her temperament had passed down to this foal as it has to others ; now we are n't sure . The grief of horses is unpredictable and worrying . They ca n't stand being alone long . We 're keeping this foal stabled with a mare in the stall next to her . Right now a mother substitute wo n't suffice . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lean over and speak to her as I 'd speak to a stubborn child . You can tell if a horse is listening . By the way her ears turn , I know she is . I slide my hands through the short silky strands of her mane and touch her nose to remind her I 'm here , then she turns her head away from me , from Marsh 's three buckets , and settles herself awkwardly in the straw on the ground , her white spindly legs sliding in a confusion of angles , her head lolling , the dark war-bonnet markings-on the crown of her head and at the base of her ears-and her dark blue eyes still visible . Her mother was also a blue-eyed paint . <p> In Texas when we began working with horses , the two of us trained thoroughbreds . Marsh did most of it . I helped , mainly by doing a lot of riding . Later , after we 'd lived in New Mexico a while , we decided to raise quarter horses , then Arabs . Now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each breed has its own set of problems . We seem to alternate between the nervous and the placid ones . <p> I chew on a straw and wonder how I can keep this baby from getting too weak . I ca n't do it by will alone . It 's as impossible to make a foal eat as it is to coerce a cranky child . Marsh has offered choices . I offer love . The dogs , Ruffian and Sly , chase each other through the stable and pause to give attention . The foal will have none of it . Nature , I decide at this point , has to take care of its own . It usually does . We 've had orphans before , I remind myself , and they survived . We 've just never had one so stubborn in its grief . <p> I pick up the baster and the jar of mare 's milk substitute-too cool now . It has to be heated until it 's between ninety and a hundred degrees to approximate the natural temperature . We use a candy thermometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on ordinary household utensils . I poured the milk substitute in an old mayonnaise jar . I 've noticed the same thing in other stables where I 've seen horse worming medicine stored in Mason jars , and alcohol in blue milk of magnesia bottles . <p> Marsh , who has been out watching the farrier set up , comes through the stable on his way somewhere . I always see his hair first . Dark when we married , it 's completely gray now . He 's still a fine looking man . I notice women glancing at him often and tell him so . He says he has n't had any good offers lately . He glances down at the line of black buckets still full of untouched offerings and shakes his head . <p> " She 's got to get hungry enough to eat sometime . We 've never lost one before from starvation . I wish you- " <p> He lets his sentence dangle because we both know what he means . After we lost our only son I could n't conceive another child , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward anxiety over the very young . <p> Marsh wishes I did n't , particularly since we breed and raise horses . We 've got two stallions and eight , sometimes ten mares . The stallions service anyone else 's who 'll pay the fee , so we also stable other people 's mares . Marsh trains all our own horses . Now and then when he wants to make more money , he 'll train other people 's . This is horseracing country ; there 's a demand for good trainers . Marsh has the kind of will tempered by patience required for training , and he has the intuitive sense required . He knows horses , knows how they react . Generally training the ones we raise plus two or three others is enough . There are other things he has to do : take stallions to shows , make sure all the horses are exercised-the grooms and I help-and fed correctly . We have three barns , one for stabling mares , one for stallions , one for breeding , sets of pens and corrals . All those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually require much time . Horses and people do . <p> There are all the other owners with mares to breed , horses to train . I keep the records-watch over the accounts , log the births , and the deaths when they take place here . Most horses have longer recorded genealogies than humans ; of course they do n't live as long . In the same ledgers I also log unusual weather-two inches of rain today , a foot of snowthe names of people and when we hired them . On the back fly leaf of each new one , I list birthdays of everybody in our families . Paradoxically , for a man who loves history , Marsh remembers horses ' dates better than humans ' . I suppose mine is the sort of list others put in a Bible ; Marsh opens the ledger more frequently . Somewhere along the way I began noting plans there too ; a new hay shelter , to France this summer maybe . We built the hay shelter ; we did n't get to France that year . The ledgers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In our beginning years , we were fortunate since early inheritances freed both of us-in some ways-the money paid for the land , provided a little . We 've always had a living to make . <p> Our parents died young . The inheritances were modest , but no matter , we 've needed to work , needed to work , needed to fill our days . Obviously we 're inclined to help orphans . We 've got two married daughters ; Kate , the oldest , lives with her husband in London . Sally 's Max , a singer , lives on the road much of the year . So does she . There are no grandchildren yet , and we long for them , trying at the same time to keep our wishes to ourselves . I would n't mind begging if I thought it would help , but a plea would be seen only as a demand to produce another generation Doing without grandchildren , giving up on perpetuation is n't a tragedy , but I despise the blankness . I wanted to know the next ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stable , stroking the orphan foal , thinking we should have adopted a son and remembering , as I always do , that first I would have none but my own , and by the time we discovered I could n't , few baby boys were available . For two years we waited ; then we gave up , left Texas , moved to New Mexico , put aside that hope , began again . <p> I am sixty now , and I wonder why we gave up on our resolution . It was n't like my failure , after years of speaking tourist Spanish and French , to really learn those languages , or Marsh 's to buy the older man 's reward , a red convertible . Those are still possibilities , though mine for the languages is dim . Perhaps we could n't truly accept someone else 's child . Now we have lived through that part of our lives , raised our children . Now we nurse foals . <p> Dave Madison hails me . He 's shod our horses as long as we 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you got there ? " <p> " More business eventually-or we hope so . " <p> He creaks over toward me . His arthritis is so bad his legs are bent with it . I can almost hear his bones popping as he walks . Dave looks like an old cowboy who has been thrown a lot , though he 's told me he 'd never ride anything as foolish as a horse . As a farrier for race tracks he 's suffered from a lot of high-spirited , nervy thoroughbreds , which has given him a low opinion of horses no matter what breed . <p> " Another paint , " he says . " Named her yet ? " <p> " No . Marsh does that . You know any tricks to get an orphan to eat ? " <p> Dave takes off his beat-up straw hat that 's as much a part of him as his hazel eyes and grizzled cheeks . He scratches his head with his free hand . " Wish I did . Which way did Marsh get off to ? " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the barn where we keep the stallions . He swears he 's not going to shoe them today , a threat he usually makes . Stallions are more trouble than horses or mares , much more temperamental , much more liable to kick or rear . <p> " Sure you are , Dave . " He shakes his head and goes out the far door , moving fast as he can though he walks a ragged line . It 's supposed to hit ninety this afternoon . He generally shoes in the cool of the morning . <p> Diego , our groom from Santo Domingo pueblo , finishes mucking out the other stalls and stops to pet the foal . His hand moves gently over her small bony head . <p> The foal 's eyelids flutter slightly . Diego knows no more than we do about how to get an orphan to eat . He 's asked the old men at the pueblo . Unfortunately they have forgotten what their fathers knew about horses . Diego has learned about horses from us , although it 's mostly a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm watching Diego as he leaves through the stable 's far door when I hear a loud neigh and catch sight of one of the stallions , Maxim I think , flashing by the door . Immediately I have a vision of Marsh flat on the ground in Maxim 's pen . We 've lived with these animals so many years , have known we had to be careful and have been . Even so , in thirty years of raising horses we have slidden off , fallen off , cracked ribs , had concussions-I 've had two , Marsh , one-been kicked , been bitten . Marsh was rolled on once . We had to get rid of an Arab that reared and threatened to flip over on his back . We 've dealt with horses that balked , shied , and bolted . If it 's someone else 's racehorse he 's training , Marsh will put up with more , but the ones who try to flip a rider off are truly dangerous . Maxim is n't that sort . We respect him as we respect any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and temperaments , and any horse is entirely capable of strange actions . I had a quarter horse that sat down like a big roan dog in the middle of the trail leaving me to bail out of the saddle when I felt his hindquarters buckling . We thought of all sorts of reasons why he might assume this peculiar position-there was no burr in his saddle pad , no leg injury , no loose shoe-and never knew exactly why . Geldings can be nearly as temperamental as stallions , so can mares . <p> I lift the foal 's head out of my lap as quickly and quietly as possible , unlatch the stall gate , and run through the barn gesturing toward Henriette , the mare most likely to be in heat . Diego , who does n't really need my instruction , is going toward her stall with a lead in hand . She 's already haltered so all he has to do is clip the lead on her and take her out . Even if she 's not in heat Maxim will come to her . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Damned idiot ! " He growls . <p> " Is Marsh- ? " <p> " Out there . Your damned prancy old son-of-a-bitch stallion- " <p> Dave is an inventive , sometimes musical cusser , but I ca n't stop to indulge him . I find Marsh standing by the gate to Maxim 's pen and breathe freely again . <p> Rufus , Maxim 's buddy in the next pen , is trotting back and forth whinnying . <p> Marsh , tension lines showing tight around his mouth , says , " He was in a hurry to get out and brushed past me . That 's all . " <p> I put both arms around him . " You all right ? " <p> " Of course . " He 's a little annoyed that I 've asked . Between the two of us I 'm the worrier . " You know Maxim does n't like being shod . He took a look at Dave and bolted . " <p> " Diego 's gone after him with Henriette . " <p> " I 'll tell Dave we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marsh turns back toward the pens where Rufus is trotting back and forth by the dividing fence , shaking his head and whinnying for Maxim . The trouble with horses is though they have memories , they still act instinctively . When Maxim left , Rufus was totally abandoned ; he has no knowledge of time 's duration , no hope that his buddy will return . He 's anxious about the possibility of absolute loss . <p> Diego rounds the corner of the barn leading Henriette and Maxim . Rufus neighs a welcome . <p> Marsh grins . We 're both accustomed to their rituals , but they please us still . <p> I go back through the barn to the garden to check on the beets and tomatoes . It 's June , our hottest , driest month , still an oddity to me since I was born in the South and complained for years , along with everyone else , about August heat . From here I ca n't hear the phone , so Lupe shouts for me . I hear Chihuahua in her voice still , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so were her parents . She says she hears Tennessee in mine . <p> " A friend calls . " Lupe has worked for us so long she can distinguish the voices of all the family and friends . If she 's in the least uncertain , she puts the unknown caller in the friend category , a habit that leaves us at the mercy of fund-raisers and brokers making cold calls . So far I have n't been able to convince her to ask for names . To do this , though she does n't say so , goes against an inner conviction that asking for someone 's name is an unpardonable rudeness . Necessary for business , yes , but not for home . She 'll ask if she 's in our office , but not if she 's in the kitchen or one of the bedrooms . We do not quarrel about this . Lupe and I never quarrel . I know the names of all her family and some of her friends ' as well . <p> " It 's me , Marianne . " Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except to tell me of someone 's death . In my mother 's family only he and his one child , Fergus , remain , and of course Uncle Phillip is n't really a Moore . He 's just lived with them so long he seems like one of them . Aunt Lucy , despite her anxieties , lived to be eightythree ; she died three years ago leaving him to live in a heap . Fergus lets him since he lives in one as well . In separate houses they hang their trousers on the backs of chairs , stack their newspapers , march their shoes in pairs along the baseboards of the walls , leave their beds tumbled , canned goods assembled on their kitchen counters . The difference is that Fergus 's collection grows-he acquires new pictures , new drinking glasses , new signs , new clothes , and equipment for his recording studio-while Uncle Phillip 's stays the same . In the living and dining rooms , where all the curtains are drawn , Aunt Lucy 's silver blackens in darkness , the patient dust settles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my Grandmother Moore 's Victorian furniture . There are piles of cards and paper , some of it never used , on the dining room table as if someone meant to write letters or send invitations then utterly forgot or the occasion was canceled . On Grandmother 's dusty what-not shelves flickers of cut glass , including the upside-down top hat that so fascinated me as a child , gleam in the swath of light when the door is opened . I 'm seldom there to open it . <p> I do n't like leaving Uncle Phillip alone in his heap of useless things . I 'm not in Nashville often and I could never order his life . That 's up to him and to Fergus . Uncle Phillip is ninety-three now . Gradually I 've begun to realize where I see disorder and sorrow , my uncle and my bachelor cousin see convenience , accommodation , ease . In their kingdoms , things do not require looking after ; they are only things . <p> My tolerance , I know , is also convenient . Distance smoothes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away to build up a reservoir of petty annoyances , and since I usually come and go only once a year , there 's always a way out . <p> Talking to Uncle Phillip I imagine him in his kitchen reaching over stacked cans of green peas , tomatoes , applesauce to the phone on the wall . He sticks to a soft diet because of a nameless stomach problem . Food continues to interest him , particularly his own diet , and he informs me gravely that he 's drinking " a lot of sweet milk . " Except for other southerners of his generation , no one else I know makes that distinction between sweet milk and buttermilk now . <p> Fergus , Uncle Phillip tells me , is out of town . In his sixties Fergus took to wandering . He says he 's going fishing . He fishes a little ; mainly he roams around looking at the country . He used to keep a boat in Florida . In the past few years , after getting a manager for his sound studio , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Belize , bass somewhere in Louisiana , pike in Minnesota . And he 's often gone for a month or longer . He phones me sometimes from bars in places like Key West or New Orleans , and the first thing he says , using a gravedigger 's tone , is , " This is your cousin , the last of the Gainers . " His voice generally sways as if he 's standing on a boat when I 'm sure he 's standing as near as he can to a bar . His father and I both wish he 'd find someone to marry again . Uncle Phillip must be lonely there by himself . I should call him more often . This morning he says he 's called because he 's seen something about Indians and horses on TV . He has remembered we raise Appaloosas . <p> " You see that ? " He asks as he usually does . He has no idea how I spend my days and believes , I suppose , that I may be watching the same programs . I say no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perce 's selective breeding , how they were the first to breed for color . I know this already . I act interested because he is . His call is so unusual I have to ask him again how he 's doing . <p> " I 'm fine , Marianne . Just fine . " <p> General phrases of well-being are all he 'll admit to unless I prod him . Fergus , I discover , is in Canada fishing . Uncle Phillip seems mildly annoyed that he 's flown so far away . <p> " He 's up there in Ontario carrying a canoe from lake to lake . " Then he adds , " There 's no fool like an old one . I had on my glasses to watch that program and now I ca n't find them . I know you ca n't do anything . " <p> " Have you asked the people upstairs to- ? " Fergus insisted he add a small apartment in his attic after Aunt Lucy died . <p> " They are n't there . " <p> " Are they out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " <p> " Well , when they- " <p> " I know , Marianne . I know . I 'll get hold of them , get them to help me look . I just called up to tell you a man can find himself in a ridiculous position in no time . I 'm ninety-three and generally in good health except for this old stomach thing and my eyesight . Everything 's a blur . I had to count the numbers on the dial to call you . Lucky I 've still got a dial telephone . Fergus wants me to get one of those touch ones . I would n't know where the numbers were on one . " <p> He laughed , and I knew he 'd probably be all right . <p> " Call me back when you find them . " <p> " No , honey . Those folks will be in after a while . I just called you while I was waiting . " <p> I 'm immediately provoked because I live so far away I ca n't really help him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance . Marsh chose too , but I chose to marry him and move . At twenty-one I chose gleefully to part with my southern family and this is where we are now , living in an adobe territorial style house not far from the Rio Grande . From my front door I can see the Russian olive trees , locusts , cottonwoods , and mulberries lining it . Behind it there 's an old orchard where we still raise a few apples mixed in with the red clover , alfalfa , and fescue for the horses . <p> The mountains , some of the lower ranges of the Rockies , the foothills of the Jemez , rise to outline the horizon . I 've exchanged the low green hills of middle Tennessee for these steeper slopes , much dryer and more distant . They can never be turned into part of a pasture . Nothing but juniper and sage grow on these arid heights , yet I do n't find them forbidding . The Rockies are geologically young mountains , raw beginnings ; I suppose they will be as old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue delphiniums in the east bed by the porch are drooping . We usually get most of our rain in July and August . I push the front door open and walk outside to water my flowers . <p> In the afternoon we drive into Santa Fe to run errands and meet friends for supper . Since the children have left , we go into town less often . I 'm sitting in the plaza waiting to meet Marsh . The monument in the middle is an obelisk like the one I used to see in Franklin 's square as a child , except this one was n't raised to commemorate the Confederate dead . It is dedicated " To the heroes who have fallen in the various battles with the indians in the territory of New Mexico . " As usual I wonder who cut the word off the stone and why . In the middle of one night I imagine a dim figure , file in hand , scratching away . Oddly the blank space demands more attention than people usually give to inscriptions , and everybody I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I suppose the Indians must have thought the heroes just as savage . Marsh says I 'm being soft-headed . He does n't mind revision , setting the records straight , but he dislikes covering everything with a contemporary mask . <p> " The marker has a marker , " he 's pointed out to me . " Look here at this little one saying it was first erected in 1862 . Back then the people fighting them were sure Indians were savage . " <p> I ca n't decide . I 'm willing to see both sides , to stand in the middle of my own confusion , then there are the Indians right there across the plaza stoically sitting on the porch of the territorial governor 's palace selling jewelry , and I sway toward them . The children I read stories to every week at the Indian School up the road from us are not in the least savage . <p> My grandmother , I remember while remaining on the hard iron bench , would call loud little children " savages , " meaning they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt however , was reserved for the sort of people who bought the place my grandfather had farmed . " Common as dirt , " she said . " I remember when they lived in a boxcar . " She was offended because they held a party for a highpriced purebred bull and gave all the male guests pansies to wear in their buttonholes . The bull was pictured in Life magazine , but she would n't look at it . I 've forgotten her whole list of things ladies did n't look at , though I know liquor store windows and mating dogs were on it . <p> When I was younger I had romantic ideas about " savages . " I thought they were people who lived freely , ate with their fingers , painted their faces , wore the least possible clothes , and got dirty as they pleased without being told to take a bath . " Savages " had all the fun . I had to give that up . I 'd forgotten I 'd believed in those pleasures until we moved to New Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor to a pueblo where an aged woman wearing a striped cotton shawl over her head stepped out of a door into the snowy mud with a slop jar in hand . It must have been an ordinary task for her . That 's what deprived me of my fun-the ordinariness of poverty . Soon after that I learned that the lack of indoor plumbing was the least of those Indians ' troubles . <p> Marsh waves and walks from a corner toward me sitting here on the bench musing . I stare at him at a little distance wondering , as longmarried people do now and then , how I came to be with this man I know well and do n't know at all , this middle-sized man with the willing smile wearing dark brown boots , size II B with slightly worn heels , in this part of the world . Though the bare facts of our lives , our daily schedules reveal a little , much is elided or frequently forgotten . Marsh , because he has historical leanings , finds comfort in the certainty of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged into ages-stone through atomic-events neatly stacked though he admits the rumpled edges may show . <p> Our own lives slip through and around , largely undefined to us . In time , to our children , we may become as eccentric , willful , and mysterious as my mother 's family , one full of drinking men and dominating women . I may be known as the one who insisted on going west to raise all sorts of horses , spoke bad Spanish and worse French , and in the way family tales grow and change , they may even say that Marsh and I went to live with the Indians . It 's impossible to know . At this point all I can hope for is more . <p>
