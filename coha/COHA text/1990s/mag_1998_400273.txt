Conifers , shrubs , perennials , and ground covers blanket a boulder-strewn slope . The sheer variety provides year-round interest . // Those of us who love plants know the feeling all too well-you see a new plant , you just got ta have it , you bring it home , and then you ask , " Now where in the heck am I going to put it ? " That 's the story behind this remarkable garden . Located near Baltimore , it contains hundreds of different plantstrees , shrubs , perennials , ornamental grasses , wildflowers , and ground covers-woven together on a hillside among footpaths of native stone . Despite its unnatural variety , it appears quite natural . And it all began because its owner has a hard time saying no . The owner , who asked to remain anonymous , recalls that when she and her husband bought the property , there was no garden , save for a few existing trees . But both come from gardening families , so they quickly began amassing plants . Many arrived by mail . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as family vacations , these outings often turned into hunting expeditions . " By the time we got back from New Hampshire and Connecticut , " she admits , " the children would be literally surrounded by green . " Before long , coveys of conifers , lilies , and Japanese maples roosted on the hillside . To bring order and turn it into a coherent design , the owners contacted nurseryman and garden designer Kurt Bluemel of Baldwin , Maryland . Kurt rearranged the collections with an eye toward the natural contours of the site . He also suggested dozens of new shrubs , grasses , and perennials . Today , this smorgasbord of contrasting foliage colors , sizes , and textures is fascinating to wander through in any season . Outcroppings , footpaths , and walls made of native stone hold it all together . When asked about her favorite plants , the owner quickly cites needleleaved conifers-dwarf Colorado blue spruce , blue atlas cedar , golden Hinoki false cypress , and umbrella pine , to name a few . " They add structure and color to the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacular things even in traditional borders by using conifers as backdrops and accents . " She touts underappreciated shrubs , such as viburnums , witch hazels , and yellowtwig dogwood . She praises lilies as " totally fearless and self-sufficient . " And she commends Japanese maples because " they 're wonderful for small gardens , there are many different kinds , and they 're all very beautiful . " A garden this diverse needs plenty of attention , but here the work is relished . " Gardening is very relaxing , and it 's great exercise , " she explains . " I love the mental challenge of learning how to grow new plants . Once the weather gets nice , absolutely nothing can keep me indoors . " Old habits die hard , however . A new plant still talks its way into the garden as fast as she feasts her eyes on it . Where to plant it is a worry for another day . " There 's always a place if you love it , " she says . // Keeping up with so many different plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gardening is so important to our lives , we ca n't even put it into words . " Rich green foliage from trees and wildflowers serves as a foil for blue fescue ( far left , foreground ) , golden Hinoki false cypress ( left foreground ) , the chartreuse blooms of lady's-mantle ( center foreground ) , blue spruce ( background ) , and the pinks and reds of azaleas ( center ) . // <p>
