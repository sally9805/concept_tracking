<p> A reservoir for computing innovation , LCS has provided a haven for startups  --  and a place for researcher/entrepreneurs to regroup and begin again . <p> Many academics see research as an end in itself . After all , the purpose of a university is to develop knowledge  --  not to make a profit . But the researchers who have worked at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science ( LCS ) since its inception 35 years ago have shown a keen sense of market potential . <p> Floating on a secure base of defense funding , the laboratory has over the decade served as a reservoir of technical creativity . LCS researchers have frequently found the Lab a comfortable base from which to launch companies that commercialized their MIT work while maintaining their academic connections . <p> LCS Director Michael Dertouzos , who started Computek in 1968 to commercialize a graphics device he had invented , sums up the appeal of this dual existence . " I had these two lives , " recalls Dertouzos . " When I got bored at LCS I went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got bored there with real engineering , which was often , " he came back to MIT . Computek grew to 120 employees before Dertouzos sold the company in 1977 and returned full time to academia  --  a pattern that was to be followed by many LCS spinoffs through the years . Infocom : The Legacy of Zork <p> Many new businesses fail , and those from lcs are no exception . But while one measure of success is financial , another is the intellectual legacy that a company leaves behind . And along this dimension , LCS spinoffs have few equals . <p> Consider Infocom , the company created in 1979 by Project MAC founder Joseph C. R. Licklider and nearly a dozen other LCS researchers . Infocom sold a peculiar kind of computer game known as " interactive fiction . " Best exemplified by Zork , the games were puzzles : The computer would print a description of the " room " that you were in , and sitting at the computer you would type back instructions on where to move and what actions to take . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a technological pioneer . To accommodate the many different kinds of computer systems in use at the time , Infocom created a virtual computer called the Z Machine . The Z Machine served as a kind of buffer between the programmers and the outside world of multiple , incompatible computer formats . The first copy of Zork sold in November 1980 and ran on Digital 's PDP-11 minicomputer . A month later , the company was selling Zork for Radio Shack 's new TRS-80 microcomputer . In February 1981 , Infocom made a version that ran on the popular Apple II  --  and proceeded to sell 6,000 copies of the game over the next eight months . Infocom ultimately created 35 different games , and in 1984 had sales of $10 million . <p> Infocom could n't sustain its growth , though , largely because the company was divided against itself . Although games supplied the revenue , Infocom 's management was determined to develop a corporate database tool called Cornerstone . By June of 1985 more than half of the company 's 110 employees were working on Cornerstone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never yielding a finished product . In December , Infocom finally shut down its business product division and laid off its staff , but it was too late . In June 1986 , with just 40 employees left , the company was sold to California-based video-game maker Activision for $9 million . Three years later , all but five of Infocora 's 26 employees quit or were laid off , and the tattered remnants of the company were absorbed into Activision 's operations . Licklider stayed at LCS , becoming its director . He retired from MIT in 1985 and died in 1990 . <p> While Infocom failed as a business , the company broke important new ground that is still being explored today . Infocom enthusiasts have created Z Machine interpreters for more than 25 different systems  --  systems as diverse as Windows 95 and the 3Com Palm Pilot . Infocom 's philosophy of making programs that run on any type of computer system stood in dramatic contrast to the prevailing way of doing business at the time . But this idea of a " portable environment " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of the Peri and Java programming languages . 3Com : Messages Through the Ether(net) <p> Another LCS progeny was not only profoundly influential , it also found dramatic commercial success . Bob Metcalfe gained his first exposure to packet-switching techniques while working at Project MAC in 1970 . How he found himself at Project MAC is a story in itself : After graduating from MIT in 1969 , Metcalfe entered a PhD program up the river at Harvard University . But Harvard did n't have the money to pay Metcalfe 's fellowship . To make ends meet , he took a job at Project MAC building a packet-switched network interface card . <p> Packet-switching is a way of transmitting data that breaks a stream of bits into short segments , called packets ; each packet is labeled with instructions for where to go . Packet-switching has caught on in a big way : It is the basis of the Internet . <p> After leaving Harvard and Project MAC in 1972 , Metcalfe migrated west to Xerox 's Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) , which was pioneering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of packet-switching to the invention of a local area network technology called Ethernet . Metcalfe convinced Xerox that to be successful , Ethernet would have to be made readily available to all players in the computer industry . Meanwhile , Metcalfe still felt the gravitational tug of MIT . In 1979 , he took Dertouzos up on an invitation to return to Boston and work for LCS as a consultant . Metcalfe enlisted Digital Equipment Corp. , Intel and Xerox to start the " Ethernet bandwagon "  --  a commitment to make Ethernet a standard of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE ) . " IEEE forced Xerox to make its Ethernet patents available for $1,000 per company forever , " says Metcalfe . <p> With the patents available at bargain-basement prices , and with Xerox still unwilling to push the technology into the general marketplace , Metcalfe seized the opportunity . He started a company and licensed the Ethernet technology . Metcalfe 's new company  --  3Com  --  built network interface cards for all kinds of computers . 3Com went public in March 1984 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Metcalfe , who eventually left the company he started to become vice president for technology at the International Data Group ( IDG ) and a columnist in IDG 's weekly trade publication , Info World , says that the MIT lab " had a great deal to do with the success of 3Com . " It 's not just that Project MAC was a pioneer in research on packet-switching , the technology at the heart of Ethernet . Equally important was the way LCS functioned as a base for Metcalfe to return to after leaving Xerox . It is doubtful that Metcalfe would have been able to enlist major companies to join his " bandwagon " were he not at an impartial institution . Software Arts : The First Killer App <p> It 's easy to forget that when the first personal computers arrived in the late 1970s , many people questioned what value such machines would have beyond entertainment and diversion for hobbyists . After a few years , nobody asked that question anymore-thanks largely to the pioneering work of Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston , who met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then went on to co-found Software Arts . <p> " Dan and I had been talking since our MIT days about doing a business , " recalls Frankston . Bricklin , who had gone off to get a master 's degree at Harvard Business School , discovered firsthand a problem that was ripe for solution by personal computers . Confronted with the typical kind of repetitive calculations that come from the school 's case studies , Bricklin devised a program that would automate the work : the electronic spreadsheet . In 1978 , Bricklin and Frankston started playing around with a prototype , which they called VisiCalc . They thought at first that VisiCalc would be a " nice home accounting program , " says Frankston . " I started working on the real implementation in late November and we were able to demo it in January 1979 . It took only a few more weeks  --  about 40 of them  --  to start a company , find a real office , buy a Prime 550 minicomputer , hire some staff , finish the program and ship the product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attention of businesses and fueling the sales of the Apple II computer , the machine on which it first ran . Many of Apple 's first customers bought the machines specifically to run VisiCalc ; it was the first " killer app . " The program let business managers manipulate numbers with undreamed-of flexibility . <p> Today , alas , Software Arts is no more . Following the introduction of the IBM PC in 1981 , domination of the spreadsheet market slipped away from Bricklin and Frankston . The new champion was Lotus Development Corp. , with a more advanced PC spreadsheet called 1-2-3 . Eventually , Lotus bought Software Arts . Frankston went on to work in high positions at Lotus and Microsoft and is now an advisor to many companies . Bricklin is founder and chief technology officer of Waltham , Mass. - based Trellix , which is developing tools for publishing documents on the Web . RSA : Masters of Encryption <p> Life on computing 's cutting edge can be a disadvantage , as it accentuates the difficulty in establishing a market niche . Sometimes , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a problem , at least for a while . RSA Data Security  --  a pioneer in commercializing an ultra-secure form of data encryption known as " public key "  --  is a case in point . <p> " We put together a business plan thinking that secure telephones would be the place to start the business , " remembers Ron Rivest , who founded the company in 1983 along with LCS colleagues Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman . While the company tried to finance and build a prototype , Rivest started working on a software implementation of the RSA encryption system that would demonstrate the technology . In those days , he recalls , " one of the problems with encryption was that nobody understood it at all . So we were developing demonstration software for education purposes  --  to illustrate what public key could do . " After a few years of failing in the secure telephone market , RSA 's management realized that secure telephones " were not the best place to start the market . " Meanwhile , those " educational " software demos turned into real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's path to riches was not through selling either hardware or software , it turned out , but by marketing " tool kits " that other companies could use easily to build the RSA algorithms into existing products . RSA 's first big customer was Iris Associates , which built RSA 's technology into a " groupware " program called Notes that it was creating for Lotus . Its second licensee was Novell , which built the technology into its Netware software for running local area networks . <p> Although Shamir and Adleman soon ended their affiliation with RSA , Rivest stayed with the company , which was sold to Security Dynamics in 1996 for $250 million . Rivest now divides his attention between RSA and his teaching and administrative duties at MIT . He is an assistant director of the LCS  --  another case of the Lab 's ability to nurture and sustain innovators after ( or between ) their entrepreneurial exploits . Rivest continued to invent cryptographic algorithms , many of which RSA commercialized . Exotech : The End of Operating Systems ? <p> In a cramped apartment less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop of LCS-bred entrepreneurs are burning with the same mix of business ambition and technical acumen that has fueled so many previous spinoffs . They have formed a company , called Exotech , whose mission it is to commercialize a high-performance server for the World Wide Web based on the " exokernel " developed by LCS professor M. Frans Kaashoek . <p> Exokernels are a fundamentally new direction for operating systems  --  the first break with the original timesharing paradigm perfected by Project MAC 35 years ago . An exokernel , explains Kaashoek , does away with the conventional notion of an operating system altogether . Instead , the idea is for application programs to interact directly and securely with the computer 's hardware , without the intermediary of something like Unix or Windows . <p> Exotech was started by four of Kaashoek 's students . They 're using the MIT exokernel to build servers for Internet service providers . To launch the business , the group borrowed $90,000 , mostly from the parents of company president Tom Pinckney . Then , to cut cost , they all moved to Pinckney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to grow is putting a financial pinch on the company . Says Pinckney : " We have people from MIT , undergraduates , who have summer jobs , part-time jobs , who are interested in full-time jobs . We have one really experienced guy . But we do n't have the money to pay them , and we do n't have the office space for them to work in . So we have to beg . " <p> The begging may soon be over . In January , Exotech started shaping up to be a real business . It delivered beta software to a customer that Pinckney identifies only as a major Internet service provider serving the Northeast United States . A final version of the product should be on the market in July , he says . With the wind filling their sails , Pinckney and his partners will have an easier time raising money . And the Lab for Computer Science will be able to put another pin on the grand map of computer technology . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Michael Dertouzos set the mold by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two lives .
