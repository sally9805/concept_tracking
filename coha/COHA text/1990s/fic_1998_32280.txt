The Ride Judd felt a tingle down his spine as he and Vicki got in the car . He 'd had enough excitement for a lifetime the last couple of weeks , but he had never been involved in anything like this . He had been a rebel , a difficult , stubborn , self-centered teen . Lying to his parents and running with the wrong crowd had been the extent of his adventureat least until the Rapture . His world had been turned upside down . Meeting three other instant orphans , having them move in , and all four of them coming to Christ within a few days made his previous life seem eons ago . Was it possible that just a few weeks ago he thought he knew everything there was to know about just about everything ? Now , strange as it seemed , he knew he was more mature and grown-up than ever , mostly because he realized how little he knew about anything . Everything important to him before now seemed childish and stupid . What he cared about now was God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way , he missed the carefree youth he had been squandering by playing the tough guy . Rascal though he was , his parents were always there to bail him out . And while they may have wondered what would ever become of him , he knew down deep they would have even forgiven him for stealing his dad 's credit card and running away to Europe . Always , there had been that escape hatch . They loved him , wanted the best for him , and would eventually forgive him and welcome him back . They had modeled God to him , but he had been too self-centered to realize it . Here he was , onhis own now , wondering when or if school would ever start up again . How would they notify the kids when it was time to come back ? How many had disappeared ? How many teachers ? Would school ever seem normal again ? And should he go to school ? If Bruce was right and Nicolae Carpathia , who had just become the new secretary-general of the United Nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he signed some sort of an agreement with Israel ? If that came soon , there would be only seven more years of life on earth as they knew it . Did Judd need an education , or would he be wasting time in class while the world hurried out of control ? These were things he and the others were going to have to discuss with Bruce . But that would be later . Now it was time to get to Chicago and to watch the police sting LeRoy Banks and Cornelius Grey . It was a trap he had devised , which had impressed Sergeant Tom Fogarty . Vicki had done a great job on the phone , pretending to be Maria Diablo , secretary to Tom Fogarty , " the attorney . " Judd had thought of the fake name for her . " Where did you come up with that name , anyway ? " she said . " Diablo means devil ' in Spanish . " Vicki shot him a double take . " You think I 'm a devil ? " " Hardly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wanted to look at Vicki , but there was still enough rubble and construction going on that he did n't dare take his eyes from the road . Judd 's grades had tumbled during the last year , but he had always been a good memorizer , probably from all the years he had spent in Bible memory clubs as a kid . That memory told him diablo was from the word diabolical , which meant " tricky " or " devious . " That was what his plan was . How many times had Judd 's mother complained , " But you 've got a good brain " ? She used to say , " Use it like you used to , and your grades will shoot up . " He knew she was right , but because he had not been controlled by God back then , he had used the gift God had given him , that sharp mind , for his own purposes . He had devised a runaway plan , saved cash he got from the stolen credit card , and made his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judd 's escape from his " awful " home life to send Christ and rapture the church . If it had n't been so devastating , Judd might have found humor in it . Though he knew the truth and what he had to doreceive Christ after allstill he found himself facing the despair of the loss of his family . Sometimes he caught himself in such a dark hole of sadness , despite finally settling things with God , that he wondered if he could go on . Maybe , he thought , that was why God had , in essence , left him in charge of these other three kids . Without that responsibility , he wondered what would have become of him . Keeping track of Ryan and Lionel alone kept his mind occupied much of the time . Then there was reading his Bible and studying what Bruce believed was crucial for him to know . Vicki did n't take any work . It was good to have someone close to his age to talk to , someone who seemed to understand him . Judd pulled onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seemed to double since the Rapture . Where was everyone going ? With so many having disappeared , it seemed strange that rush hour lasted all day and half the night now . People were desperate , frantic to see how this would all sort itself out . What would happen to their jobs , their companies , their careers , their plans ? It would be months , Judd figured , before the roadways were cleared of all the crashed cars and debris . It seemed all he and the others heard or saw on the news was crime and mayhem . Bad people took advantage of bad times , and times had never been as bad as this . Judd was grateful Vicki was with him . On the one hand , he thought she was the type of girl he could get interested in , but on the other he realized that , had it not been for the crisis they found themselves in , they would never have even met . In fact , with him being from the ritzier part of Mount Prospect and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have ever had anything to do with each other . That all seemed so petty now . What was so important about how people looked and acted and dressed , or how much money their parents made , had nothing to do with their personal worth . Maybe some people would have been embarrassed to date someone from a lower class than themselves , but Judd had already seen how shallow that was . When he talked to Vicki and spent time with her , he realized she was the same person whether she wore his mother 's clothes or whether she wore her own . With or without makeup , with or without jewelry , who she was came through . At first her grammar was lazy and she used a lot of slang . But she knew better . It was clear she had a good mind . She had been even more rebellious than Judd , and it was dear she had seen how wrong she had been too . Judd wanted to talk about the sting they were about to witness , but there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and as far as they knew , neither LeRoy nor Cornelius suspected a thing . The only question was whether Talia had figured out what was happening . She had told Vicki that her brother and LeRoy were looking to cash in on insurance money . That had given him the idea of how to trap them . Would Talia catch on to that ? And if she tipped the two guys off , would they avoid the sting or come in shooting ? For sure they would come armed . Both had enough enemies to make them look over their shoulders no matter where they went . That was why Sergeant Fogarty insisted that , while Judd and Vicki could come and watch , they had to be behind the protective one-way mirror , out of the way if anything bad happened . Vicki was n't sure yet what she thought of Judd . She had heard his story enough that she felt she knew it as well as her own . She was surprised at how similar they were , both having been rebellious kids . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a setup like he had : his own room in a huge , expensive home , permission to drive his parents ' cars , the latest clothes , the best gadgets , and never having to work . What was to rebel against ? While she had always told herself she hated her parents ' religion and rules , it was really where they lived that she hated . Vicki never would have admitted that to a rich kid . In fact , she would have defended the trailer park and its people over the phonies who lived in the big houses and did n't seem to care about anyone . Sure , her neighbors could be loud and destructive , but look what kind of lives they led . No one could get ahead . They were all working to just get by . Vicki had wanted to get out of that environment , and she had the sinking feeling it would never happen . Now , here she was , trying to convince herself she could fit into a different culture . But was it just living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think and act and even talk differently ? She knew better than that . She had grown up overnight , and like Judd often said , the things they used to think were so important were n't so important after all . Her biggest change , though she looked different , was inside . She did n't have to apologize for being a trailer-park girl . She certainly did n't feel as if she were somehow from a lower class of people than Judd was . He had treated her nicely from the beginning , and she did n't get the impression he was just condescending to her . He seemed like a good kid , and he sure was smart . She was too , if she could believe her teachers . They had constantly told her she could do better and that she was n't working up to her potential . But the idea of sitting up late at night studying instead of running with her friends almost made her gag . Now she felt like a fool . Like Judd , she missed the family she had squabbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice . If she ever got the chance again , she would . Everything was different now . What a difference a few weeks made . More than that , she realized , the difference had come in an instant . Everything she ever thought or cared about changed when her perspective changed . And nothing could have changed her perspective more dramatically than millions of peopleincluding her whole familydisappearing , just like they said they might someday . Vicki shook her head as she thought about it . When you 're wrong , you 're wrong , she told herself . " What ? " Judd asked , startling her . " What what ? " she said . " Out of the corner of my eye , I saw you shaking your head . " " I was just thinking , " she said . " How different you and I are from who we thought we were not that long ago . " " I was just thinking the same thing . " " Are you scared ? " Vicki asked , suddenly changing the subject . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . " " ' Course . Are n't you ? " " Yeah , " she said , " but it 's kind of fun , and there 's no way I 'd miss it . It 's like being in a TV show or a movieonly it 's real . " * * * Several minutes later Judd found the street he was looking for and parked three blocks away and around the corner . " We 've got to hurry , " he said . " Fogarty does n't want us to be around here in case LeRoy or Cornelius comes early to check out the area . "
