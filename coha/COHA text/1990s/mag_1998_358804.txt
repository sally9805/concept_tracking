Inventing a terrorist conspiracy and then setting it in contemporary Jerusalem may seem a coals-to-Newcastle sort of enterprise . Why bother with make-believe when the reality is so vivid and convoluted ? Robert Stone provides an engrossing answer in his sixth novel , Damascus Gate ( Houghton Mifflin ; 500 pages ; $26 ) . All of Stone 's previous fiction has featured heroes whose problems are implicitly religious . Their pathologies  --  the heavy ingestion of drugs and booze , the habit of seeking or stumbling into serious , life-threatening trouble  --  stem from their uneasy sense that God still exists , but not for them . Damascus Gate makes this problem perfectly clear . <P> Christopher Lucas is an American journalist living in Jerusalem and looking for a story . He has quit his " comfortable and rather prestigious newspaper job " and now scrambles as a free-lancer . This job change has left him unsettled : " It was so hard to get it right , working without the assignment , the rubric , the refuge of a word count . No one behind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meets in Jerusalem asks him about his religion . The question troubles him because he can answer it only in the past tense : " My father was a nonpracticing Jew . My mother was a sentimental Catholic . " What he has inherited from his parents continues to elude him . <P> Early in the story Lucas hears of Dr. Pinchas Obermann , who treats victims of the Jerusalem Syndrome . The journalist hears the term from a friend and asks , " Which is ? " The reply : " Which is coming here and God gives you a mission . To Christians like your good self , only crazy ones . " Lucas later meets Obermann and accompanies him on his rounds with his hospitalized patients : " They met some famous figures from Scripture . Noah was present , glancing uneasily at the smoggy sky . Samson , unbound but closely supervised in a room of his own , sneered at Lucas 's philistine lack of conditioning . " <P> This passage captures the ironic , skeptical attitude Lucas tries to maintain toward religious enthusiasms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . He starts research on a book about the Jerusalem Syndrome just as a dramatic instance of it  --  a plan , no less , to blow up the mosques on the Temple Mount  --  begins to engulf people he knows and eventually him as well . <P> Stone takes his time putting all the elements of an enormously complicated plot into place . Much religious arcana are offered : " How the Kabbalistic doctrine of ayin , the unknowable element in which the Infinite exists , had its Hindu cognate in the concept Nishkala Shiva , the remote absolute . " Reading the first half of Damascus Gate can , at such moments , feel like a long uphill trek . <P> But the ride down the other side more than justifies the climb . Stone 's skill at contriving apocalyptic conclusions was visible in his first novel , A Hall of Mirrors ( 1967 ) , and he maintained this standard for more than three decades . Not even his dedicated readers will be able to foresee the twists and impact of this new novel . Damascus Gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
