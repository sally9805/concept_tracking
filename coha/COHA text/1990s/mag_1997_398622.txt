There 's no end to the neat and the nifty in rifles and related gear . As proof we offer the following . Photograph DAKOTA ARMS 97 HUNTER COOPER ARMS MODEL 36 WESTERN CLASSIC WEATHERBY MARK V ACCUMARK LIGHTWEIGHT // DURING THE COURSE OF THE year , I get to use some fine equipment that does n't get reported on for one reason or another . So here it is , just in time for Christmas : Weatherby Mark V Accumark Lightweight . Since its introduction two years ago , the Weatherby Accumark has become so popular that it has eclipsed the Mark V Deluxe , which has been the company 's mainstay since its introduction in 1958 . The reason is simple : Accumarks shoot like hell . I 've tried four , and all have been sub-minute guns . However , they are big , heavy rifles-not something you 'd want to carry for very long . So Weatherby has , by various artful means , chopped the Accumark down to under 7 1/2 pounds and lopped the 26-inch fluted barrel back to 24 inches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .30/06 , and it is altogether a nifty gun . Dakota Arms 97 Hunter . Dakota Arms came to fame by producing wood-stocked semi-custom rifles based on a bolt action that incorporates the best features of the Winchester Model 70 and the 98 Mauser . These Dakotas are not only very handsome , but fairly costly as well , so now there is a much lowerpriced synthetic-stocked version called the Model 97 Hunter . Made in righthand only ( a southpaw version is in the works ) , it 's chambered for .257 Roberts through .375 H &H,; and incorporates H-S Precision pillar-bedded stocks made to Dakota 's design and Lothar Walther barrels . Weight is 7.6 pounds , and the price , while not cheap , is anything but high as rifles go these days . Savage Model 110FP Tactical Rifle . Tactical rifles are bolt-actions that law-enforcement personnel use to shoot people who disagree with them , but they also make dandy beanfield guns , and have been very popular with civilians . Savage 's tactical rifle , if the one I shot is any indication , is ungodly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots inside 1/2 inch at 100 yards with monotonous regularity . Savage chambers the 110 FP for .223 through .300 Winchester Magnum , and charges remarkably little money for it . Jarrett Barrels . There is no shortage of fine rifle barrels , but here is one that is truly worth your attention . Kenny Jarrett is a South Carolina gunsmith of whom I have written before , and now he is making his own stainless-steel barrels . They 're pull-buttonrifled and come in calibers from .22 through .416 ( sorry , no .35s ) . You can get them in any reasonable length , twist , and profile . The price is $250 . I have a .30/06 with a Jarrett barrel , and I 'd tell you how well it shoots , but you would n't believe me . Swarovski 3X-1OX AL riflescope . Very few Americans can pronounce Swarovski ( and I 've given up trying to explain it ) , but that does n't stop this Austrian company from building some of the finest glass sights around . " AL " stands for American Lightweight , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of European shooters . Last year I used one in Wyoming , Manitoba , and other places too fierce to mention , and found that it is as fine a sight as you could wantbright , sharp , and tough to a fare-theewell . It 's also distinctly affordable . Cooper Arms Model 36 Classic Sporting Rifle . Cooper is a comparatively new firm , and has been among the leaders in the renaissance of the fine .22 rimfire . The Model 36 may well be the most beautiful rifle in the category . Hardened gun nuts stand before the Cooper booth at the SHOT Show and turn away stunned and incapable of speech . Coopers are not cheap , but if you believe that a rifle is more than just something you shoot .... Ultra Light Arms Model 20 RF Bolt-Action Rifle . Melvin Forbes , who heads Ultra Light Arms , did not set out to produce a beautiful .22 ; he wanted accuracy above all , and he got it . I 've shot a number of Model 20s , and seen others shot , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Forbes shoots moths with his Model 20 . Small moths . It 's not cheap , but any serious shooter should find it affordable . Neil Jones Cleaning Rods . In his landmark paper Understanding the Extremely Silly , Sigmund Freud said : " Sometimes a cigar is only a cigar , but a good cleaning rod is a necessity . " So true . It takes a lot of shooting to burn out a barrel , but you can wreck one quickly with a crummy cleaning rod . Some people like plastic-covered rods , and some like bare steel , and of the latter , the best I 've seen are made by Neil Jones Custom Products . They 're hard , springy stainless and are very reasonably priced considering that they 'll outlast you . NJCP also has a nifty line of other shooting goodies , including a very useful action-cleaning kit . Eagle Industries Scoped Rifle Case . Eagle specializes in equipment for cops and military personnel , but a lot of it works very well for sportsmen . The Eagle Scoped Rifle Case ( SR49BP ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even long-barreled varminters with big scopes . Made of Cordura nylon , it comes with a carrying handle , tvo hideaway shoulder straps so you can pack it on your back , and a big accessory pocket . And it 's strong . Eagle builds their stuff to survive wars , not hunting trips . The Duluth Monarch #4 backpack . This story starts in Quebec three years ago when I had to carry a butchered caribou a mile or so to a Zodiac boat . When the job was over , I was a mess , and I vowed to get a tumpline pack like the Quebecois guides used . Duluth Tent and Awning Company in Duluth , Minnesota , makes an entire line of tumpline packsheavy-canvas sacks with shoulder straps and a strap that goes across the top of the head to take up much of the load . The Monarch #4 is the top of the line-it has a cavernous ( 4,752-cubic-inch ) main compartment , heavily padded leather shoulder straps , two big external pockets , a waistbelt , and a map holder that straps to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the combinations it can accommodate : * An accordion , a bowling ball , and an armadillo. * Dallas Cowboys running back Emmett Smith and a complete silver tea service for twelve . * Two entire cases of Vienna sausages and one of the original Gutenberg Bibles . * A 70-hp outboard motor and Jenny McCarthy . ( If Ms. McCarthy would like to see if she actually can fit in the pack , she can reach me at the FIELD &; STREAM offices . I 'm willing to omit the motor . ) Get the idea ? What I was not prepared for was the quality of the pack . It 's made of beautiful 18-ounce canvas and thick leather that smells like the inside of a new luxury car . I do n't know if I 'll be able to use it for its intended purpose-it might get blemished . In a world where most things come out of test tubes , it 's very heartening to see something like the Duluth Monarch #4 . The price is $179.95 .
