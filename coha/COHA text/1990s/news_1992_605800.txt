<p> On a fall day in 1984 , at a downtown business luncheon , I met a veteran local stockbroker and asked him what he thought was the most promising stock in Washington . He answered , without hesitation , that Perpetual Financial Corp . was the best . <p> " It is n't doing much now , " he said , " but it is going to do very well in the future . " <p> The broker was quite right . Within two years , the stock became the darling of Washington investors . It moved from about $ 3.25 a share , adjusted for a two-for-one split , to about $ 20 , a gain of more than 500 percent . <p> Unfortunately , the euphoria over Perpetual stock was short-lived . In 1987 , Perpetual shares , along with many others , were badly battered in the stock market crash . Within another two years , the economy was slowing down and the real estate crisis was upon us . Before long , the thrift examiners were knocking on Perpetual 's door . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrift institution would go under and , in fact , many faithful investors held onto their Perpetual stocks and bonds until the bitter end . <p> It had been much the same with investors in National Bank of Washington and James Madison Bank . Like Perpetual , they were old Washington institutions and shareholders kept hoping for a miracle that would help them survive . But miracles in the financial services industry are in short supply these days . <p> When Perpetual joined the casualty list recently , it was reported that the thrift 's failure cost taxpayers $ 418 million . Interestingly enough , investors in Perpetual lost almost that much , if one calculates the value of the 13.8 million common shares at their peak price of $ 20 . <p> On that basis , the common stock was worth $ 276 million . The thrift 's 4.6 million shares of preferred stock , issued at $ 10 each , were worth $ 46 million . And there were $ 61.1 million worth of convertible bonds still outstanding . <p> The grand total : $ 383.1 million that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents who thought that a familiar thrift with lots of offices and friendly tellers just had to a solid investment . <p> Without doubt , the broker who said in 1984 that Perpetual was going to be a great stock was right . It was . For a while . But when it stopped being a great stock , savvy investors would agree , they should have gotten out . <p> But that is hindsight . How were investors to know what would happen ? <p> What makes such decisions even more difficult is that investors are always being told that they should not try to outguess the stock market and that the way to succeed is to invest for the long-term . So , why should they have jumped out of Perpetual stock ? <p> The only answer seems to be that investors must be vigilant . There are few , if any , stocks that investors can put away and forget about . Investors who do not watch what is happening to their stocks are likely to get some unpleasant surprises . <p> Elsewhere on the banking battlefield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate crisis have seen their shares move up since New Year 's Day . <p> MNC Financial Inc. , whose stock once sold at almost $ 30 and got as low as $ 1.88 during last year , opened its 1992 trading at $ 4.875 . Since then , the stock has strengthened , and it closed Friday at $ 7.25 . <p> One of the reasons for the upward blip may have been a report issued by MNC , indicating that its losses were declining and a turnaround might be in sight . <p> MNC is the parent of Maryland National Bank and American Security Bank . <p> Another upward move , although a smaller one , was made by Riggs National Corp . of Washington , whose stock sold at $ 41.50 several years ago , during the prosperous days of banking . At the start of this year , Riggs shares were trading at $ 4.25 , after having been down to $ 3.75 during 1991 . On Friday , after a fairly strong week of trading , Riggs closed at $ 5.75 . <p> Bank stock trader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement in the two stocks reflected investor hopes that the worst of the bad news is behind the two bank companies . <p> Another gainer last week was Dominion Bankshares Corp . of Roanoke , which saw its stock bottom at $ 4.88 a share last year  --  after selling at a high of $ 25.50 during the happier years . On Jan. 1 , Dominion stock was selling at $ 10.75 a share . <p> Then , last week , the stock shot up to $ 13 a share after the bank announced a plan to streamline the institution and do some major cost-cutting . The bank said it would cut its work force by 530 employees and would close or sell 30 branches , including eight in the Washington area . Investors quickly indicated that they liked what they heard . <p> " Cold calls " from stockbrokers  --  usually in the middle of dinner  --  are a constant irritant , but investors wo n't get any nighttime calls from brokers at Ferris , Baker Watts Inc. , a regional Washington-Baltimore firm with 172 brokers in 18 offices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nighttime cold calls have been banned . <p> " It 's been a longtime practice in our entire industry to intrude on the family time of prospective investors . We feel that this is wrong and we are proud to be the first to say so and to do something about it , " Ferris said . <p> Lou Akers , the sales manager , said he talked to a number of brokers before the decision was made and found " the vast majority thought it was a good idea . " <p> Ferris , Baker Watts brokers still will be able to make daytime cold calls to businesses and residences , Akers said . <p> Will District residents have to pay D.C. income tax on their out-of-state municipal bond earnings ? Some D.C. residents thought the question already had been answered and that the answer was a clear " No . " But the fact is , the final answer is still not in . Here 's why : <p> Under a plan that was due to take effect Jan. 1 , D.C. residents were going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought after Jan. 1 . But the City Council decided before the end of the year to repeal that plan . <p> So the council passed emergency legislation to do so . It later passed temporary legislation to do so . And finally , it passed permanent legislation to do so . <p> Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly signed both the temporary and permanent legislation in late December . She now must act on the permanent repeal legislation and has until Dec. 28 to do so . <p> The key question is : If the mayor signed the first two pieces of legislation , is n't she likely to sign the permanent bill ? <p> One would think so , but Henry McCoy , a legislative analyst in the mayor 's office , said , " It 's still under discussion . " The mayor has not yet made a decision , he said , because she is still studying the effect the repeal would have on the city 's tax revenue . <p> It has been estimated that tax would bring in about $ 2 million . But Council Chairman John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea and wanted it dropped . A number of residents also have threatened to move out of town , he noted , and that could be costly to the city . <p> Stay tuned . <p> After several sluggish years , Tultex Corp . of Martinsville , Va. , may be reawakening , reports research director John S. Pickler of Wheat , First Butcher &; Singer in Richmond . <p> Tultex makes the fleecewear used in sports clothing . The reason for his optimism , Pickler said , is that Tultex has signed a licensing agreement with Brittania Sportswear Ltd. , a subsidiary of Levi Strauss &; Co. , that will allow Tultex to manufacture fleecewear under the Brittania label . <p> Secondly , Tultex plans to acquire Logo 7 Inc. which does screen-printing of sports apparel under license from professional sports teams in football , baseball , hockey and basketball . Logo 7 had $ 85 million in sales in 1991 and thus could help Tultex 's profits in 1992 , Pickler said . <p> Tultex earnings in 1991 , Pickler estimated , will drop to 35 cents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks the company could turn in a 70 cents a share profit for 1992.
