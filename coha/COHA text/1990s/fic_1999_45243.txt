Editor 's note2299 : We who write history rarely question point of view . We claim omniscience - as though we know what only gods can know - giving credibility to our abstractions with the appropriate academi-babble . Therefore , it will come as no surprise if we locate ourselves inside the thinking  --  feeling of our protagonist , young clone Pang Lawws , who has left his asteroid home and now travels through space in search of release from his excruciating new loneliness . <p> THE FUEL DISPLAY on Pang 's small spacecraft said Empty . Pang had , to some degree , built his rattletrap craft to resemble a small rocket from Dizneyland , Ancient Earth , circa 1983 . From his only companion , the robot Cal , Pang had obtained non-vital circuit boards , pumps , and servos in exchange for a picture of the beautiful Princess Graceful . With additional parts from his asteroid 's life support system and Cal 's collection of celestial flotsam , Pang had modified the asteroid 's only lifeboat . Careless with decimal points , he had not dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some intelligence but little experience , knew that words do not directly change the composition of matter . His robot tutor had taught him a smattering of general semantics , including the slogan , slightly scrambled by a computer glitch , " The mat is not the territory . " Inside the tiny cockpit , Pang banged his fist on the control console and yelled , " You 're NOT empty ! " In space , a craft that has run out of fuel probably wo n't crash . However , it may drift forever , or at least for a very long time . " I 'm lost in space , " screamed Pang . He took a deep breath , which assisted him in also executing a semantic pause . " That was Pang One , " he said to himself , also making use of the general semantics formulation of indexing , " Pang One often reacts before thinking . Do n't panic , now . Pang Two here , the Pang who thinks before reacting . " " Get lost , Pang Two . I 'm done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expunged , extinct , obsolete , " yelled Pang One . " You would benefit from speaking in E-Prime , " Pang Two admonished . " Admittedly , Shakespeare does use the phrase I am as an effective dramatic device . For example , wounded by a poisoned sword , Hamlet says " I am dead , Horatio . " However ... " " Stuff Shakespeare , " hissed Pang One . " Take another deep breath , " said Pang Two quietly . " And use up all the oxygen ! " " Hold your breath , then . " " Why should I listen to an idiot who has n't even got enough sense to panic ? " " Because you 're talking to yourself . " " Oh ... " Pang 's conversation with Pang apparently had a calming effect . Pang had often found words soothing . He leaned back in his seat , and refrained from pushing buttons some combination of which might execute the self-destruct maneuver . " If only I could crash , " he muttered , gazing miserably at the instrument panel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few hundred switches , plenty of pretty colored lights , a joystick , and a keyboard . The joystick operated various computer games , which provided 4D graphics to twenty-nine monitors . Because of upgrades , most of the switches had long ceased to do anything significant . Grid lines on the one navigational monitor began to waver , suggesting that scanners had detected a small mass somewhere below to port , perhaps a small asteroid nearby , or a larger body farther away . Almost any kind of crash landing would seem better than drifting off into deep space . Plummeting onto an abandoned station , an asteroid , a dead ship , or practically any other object , would do . Scans from other directions continued to produce unbroken lines on the visual display , indicating virtual emptiness out there . Pang typed rapidly . &lt;for details CLICK HERE 1 &gt; &lt;1 &gt; Although voice control of computers had existed for centuries , spaceship-design psychologists argued that fear of verbal ambiguity would reduce an astronaut 's comfort level , and so the archaic QWERTY keyboard remained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated systems could not distinguish between cockpit commands and a pilot doing the Sun crossword puzzle out loud . ) More expensive spacecraft had the same type of keyboard , labeled ergonomic in gold script lettering . On the navigation monitor , the grid of green lines became whirlpool of swirling colors . " Ah , " cried Pang , typing frantically again . The image became a vortex of multicolored circles with a dark hole in the center . Pang observed the surrounding calibrations a moment and concluded that they indicated an object the size of a baseball stadium , perhaps a thousand kilometers away . Pang typed . The steering engines gave short bursts to adjust the craft 's course . Now , if he had enough fuel ... As any Cyberpaedia Terra Fluxus , 47th Editon2290 will tell you , Pang Laww 's chance stop at the Galactic Cafe set off a series of events that ultimately ricocheted throughout the universe and profoundly changed the way we understand Shakespeare ... but that 's another story .... The Galactic Cafe , a once busy inter-asteroid " truck stop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform orbiting in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter . It used to be called the Asteroidal Truck Stop Cafe , and in the days before that business went bust , the joint was bustling . Inside , you risked physical injury from the sheer density of the crowd , and permanent ear damage from the riotous uproar , hubbub , and clamor of freighter pilots bombed on paracaffeine and verbal auto-intoxication , nomadic mineral miners drunk on lust and synthohol , and itinerant pleasure persons strung out on greed and exhaustion . The beds in the back never got cold , and the ultra-showers had no off-switch . That was before power-hungry entrepreneur and potential world dictator Mack E. O'Wally had manipulated the minerals market , and consequently the mining of nearby asteroids had ceased to pay . Mining ships had gone elsewhere , and the cafe became a ghostly shell with usually only a nightlight and a few starving rats to give it signs of life . Since then , the few customers who actually stopped at the cafe were those lost through navigational error , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until recently , one could sometimes obtain low quality fuel or moldy candy bars from the two remaining antiquated temperamental vending machines manufactured by the Chuck Jones Acme Gadgetry Company back in the 20th century . Some might consider the Galactic Cafe a rather grandiose name , since space travelers have not yet ventured beyond our solar system . The deck , or " lunch pad , " as the Cafe 's menu so cutely puts it , is supported by a grid of criss-crossed girders that makes it look like a fabrication from a Mechano set . Only one building stands on the flat surface of this artificial asteroid . The new owner of the Galactic Cafe , a person known as " Dolly , " had renovated that structure to resemble the cafe in Edward Hopper 's painting " Nighthawks . " Hoppers painting only showed part of the cafe , so Dolly had completed her design by scavenging her ideas from other sources , including an old Standard Oil Calendar she 'd purchased at the Smithsonian Institute liquidation sale . The resulting architecture looked like the mutant offspring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona Art Deco filling station . Dissatisfied with the bleakness of the flat featureless launch area , Dolly had installed some unique decorations that would make the cafe memorable to space travelers and historians alike . A huge illuminated rainbow now stood twice as tall as the cafe building . Inside this illuminated arch hung large blazing yellow letters that spelled out Galactic Cafe . Still aesthetically ungratified , Dolly added three twice-lifesize green neon palm trees , two gigantic pink neon flamingoes , and a huge blue neon fountain in which sequenced flashing lights gave the appearance of falling water . Electrical faults often caused this concatenation of ancient transformers and aged neon tubing to flash , buzz , and spark . Certain sections of the illumination occasionally went dead , and then came alive again without human intervention . Radiation from the system interfered with the navigational instruments and communication of ships within a wide radius . The same radiation also provided a useful , if unofficial , homing beacon for anyone seeking coffee , donuts , and scientifically clean rest rooms . In fact , it was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pan 's fuel-starved spacecraft and allowed him to find refuge , saving his life , and changing the course of history . Now it so happened that while Pang was fumbling with the controls of his vehicle in an effort to save himself , Dolly sat behind the cafe counter thinking about her one-day vow of silence . She 'd recently viewed a book called The Silence of the Shams , ( Virtual Press . Sea of Tranquillity : 2122 ) , a murder mystery in which two detectives disguise themselves as silent monks . Dolly felt the story had a bad plot , but she 'd enjoyed the description of the silent monastery . She had written a sign on a piece of cardboard and hung it on a string around her neck , just in case the cafe had a customer . The sign said : " Under vow of silence , please point or gesture . " Dolly had actually begun her one-day vow of silence several weeks previously , and since no customers had arrived , she 'd taken a new vow each morning . She desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on another cognizant being . Pang received no answer from his emergency calls . Dolly , in keeping with her vow of silence , had switched off all communication equipment . Pang 's craft skidded across the landing pad shooting off sparks , paint , and a few nuts and bolts , and came to rest near the entrance to the Galactic Cafe . Dizzy from his bone-shaker landing , Pang secured his space suit , emerged from his craft , and staggered toward the cafe door . He paused , put a hand on the airlock handle , and peered through the thick glass . His heart pounded and his ears rang . In all his twenty years , Pang had never seen such a beautiful woman . He stood immobilized , clutching the door handle , overwhelmed by a poignant sweet-and-sour feeling , like the delicate longing one feels on hearing the first robin of spring , or the poignant twinge of one 's first loose baby tooth , or the ache of eating too many chocolate sundaes . In fact , Pang had never seen a girl before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside from those in various graphics and virtual entertainments . He 'd definitely never seen a live one . For a long time , Pang stood in the Cafe 's shadows on that decaying artificial asteroid , peering in the plate glass door at the yellow-lit chrome , red leatherette , and white plastic interior of the Galactic Cafe . He touched his chest , where he had a portrait of Princess Graceful sewn into his space suit . Of Princess Graceful , he had only seen pictures . The woman in the cafe , of wavy blonde hair , welcoming smile , and a face so lovely it made him die a little inside , looked very much alive . Pang opened the glass door of the Galactic Cafe and trudged in . The airlock hissed shut behind him . Outside , his minuscule space vehicle sat alone on the pitted expanse of the Galactic Cafe launch pad , sizzling , creaking , and cracking internally as the machinery cooled . Inside the cafe , he removed his helmet and took a deep breath . Appliances hummed , fluorescent lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost empty room . All Pang could think of was that he had never seen such beauty . He would like to have spoken with Dolly . So far in his life , he had not spoken to a live human being . For his first 19 years , he had not known of the existence of language , until his robot teacher had begun to function properly , and instruct him in language use . When Pang had discovered language , he 'd also discovered loneliness . Until then , he 'd lived in a blur of happy sensations and feelings , undisturbed by high abstractions of the verbal kind . Since he had learned to speak , his conversations had been with various voice-responsive devices and his robot companion , caregiver , and educator , Cal . How he 'd longed to talk to a living person ! However , on observing Dolly 's sign which read " Under vow of silence , please point or gesture , " Pang politely refrained from speaking . Dolly found this handsome young man especially attractive . She 'd sworn off men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she felt renewed . By means of pointing and gesturing , Pang made it known that he felt hungry . He attempted to convey the information that his ship had run out of fuel , but gave this up for the moment . Seeing Dolly moved him powerfully , particularly when she looked at him and her pupils dilated . The necessity for pointing and gesturing eventually led to touching and this eventually led to Pang realizing that his space suit was not designed to accommodate a healthy young male suddenly experiencing a certain joie de vivre . With further gesturing , touching , pointing , and tugging , Dolly led Pang to her bedroom in the back of the Galactic Cafe , where she helped relieve him of his constricting space suit . As their passions grew , Dolly , who had renounced men for many years , and twenty-year-old Pang , who 'd never had anything to renounce , struggled to free themselves of tangled clothing . As they moved hurriedly toward Dolly 's bed , Pang clumsily hit two keys on Dolly 's personal computer console @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in storage there . Thus Pang made love to a beautiful woman before he had ever spoken to a human being of any kind . Nor did he speak to Dolly for a long long time , due to circumstances beyond his control . If Pang had given thought to his general semantics , he might have described his silent night of love as genuinely representative of pure non-verbal experience . Although he did n't speak , his mind raced with verbal abstractions and distractions . He 'd never experienced such beautiful sensations , such tender emotions , such joy and bliss . If only he could freeze these precious , lovely , wondrous moments , and lock them up with words . If only he knew with what words to begin . The lovers slept blissfully . Later , Pang awakened , yawned , and stretched . As his senses began to function , he became aware of himself lying beside Doll 's magnificent warm body on genuine synthetic silk sheets on a soft rectangular bed in a white triangular room . Pang got out of bed , walked across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost said , see a ship on the launch pad , but held back his words in deference to Dolly 's vow of silence . Looks like a war ship , he wanted to say . As Pang turned toward Dolly , the door exploded inwards and troops stormed in waving negative energy weapons . Dolly screamed . Strictly speaking , this did not constitute breaking her vow of silence , because her utterance formed no words , just a wrenching , piercing , penetrating , agonizing shriek . Pang lunged across the room and threw himself on top of Dolly to protect her . Dolly wrestled one arm free , reached out and pounded her fist on a button in the headboard , then wrapped her arms around Pang and held on tight . The bed tipped and Pang felt himself sliding down a dark tunnel . He lost his hold on Dolly and felt her slip away . He landed on a padded floor , and Dolly thumped down beside him . Above them , a hatch clanged shut . Dolly dragged Pang to his feet , pushed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slammed the transparent lid . Pang twisted his neck almost out of joint in order to watch Dolly as she jumped into a matching escape module . Pang strapped himself in . Dolly banged loudly on the plastic bubble of her escape pod . Pang saw her mouthing words at him , but he could n't hear . He saw her gesturing , then pointing at the instrument panel of her module . Pang looked down at the panel of his vehicle and saw a green button labeled " GO . " Pang punched the button , the small craft shook , rumbled , and Pang suddenly felt his seat jammed into his back . The dim interior of the launch tube disappeared in a blur as his machine shot forward . After a moment in darkness , he plunged out into the black star-specked perpetual night of space . Pang felt that familiar flash of awe at finding himself suddenly surrounded on all sides by the star-lit cosmic void . Does God exist ? he wondered . &lt;CLICK HERE 2 &gt; Do I exist ? Yikes , this seat feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gene U. Fletch , Professor of Philosophy , Religion and Consumer Affairs at UU , proved the existence of God with a theory supported by a hundred troglibytes of computer evidence . The following year , his arch rival , Prof. Verboser Than U , countered with a theory supported by two hundred troglibytes of computer memory that disproved the existence of God . In 2150 , Dr. Eve Evers joined the fray by publishing a multidimensional theory that required a million troglibytes of computer memory and proved she did n't know whether God existed or not . An inter-planetary commission of distinguished scientists , philosophers , and religious experts considered the three theories for thirty years , and in a written decision said that all three theories had equal validity , while a minority dissenting opinion said that because God worked in mysterious ways , only God could resolve the question so why not break for lunch . Later , Dean Odious Rex ( who had commissioned the commission ) declared its results invalid , and gave its members a month 's detention listening to adenoidal children reading Proust 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pang craned his neck this way and that , searching the sky for Dolly 's escape module . He could not see her . For several minutes he examined the escape pod 's instrument panel , seeking a means of steering his vehicle in order to turn around . He had to find Dolly . He 'd found his love , and now they 'd been wrenched apart . Pang could find no way to control his craft , which was moving rapidly away from The Galactic Cafe . Where had Dolly gone ? Had she escaped in the other pod ? Was she trapped in the Cafe 's under-structure ? There were no monitors , no scanners , no communicators , no means of seeing or conversing with another craft . An illuminated display proclaimed , " auto-route locked on . " Aside from the big green button marked " GO , " and a sickly yellow button lettered " For Your Convenience " there were no other controls . He 'd loved and lost in space . And never said a word .
