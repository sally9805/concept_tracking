After my lawn had burned away to straw last summer , and the local papers announced that the season had been one of the driest in the recorded history of New England , I found myself wondering how long we can go on pretending that nothing is amiss with the world 's weather . It was n't just the fifty ducks near my house that had died when falling water levels in a creek exposed them to botulism-infested mud , or the five hundred people dead in the Midwest from an unexpected heat wave that followed the season 's second " one-hundred-year flood " in three years . It was also the news from New Orleans ( overrun by an extraordinary number of cockroaches and termites after a fifth consecutive winter without a killing frost ) , from Spain ( suffering a fourth year of drought in a region that ordinarily enjoys a rainfall of 84 inches a year ) , and from London ( Britain 's meteorological office reporting the driest summer since 1727 and the hottest since 1659 ) . The reports of changes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years , most urgently since 1988 , when Dr. James Hansen , director of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies , declared that the era of global warming was at hand . As a newspaper correspondent who had reported on the United Nations Conferences on the environment in Stockholm in 1972 and in Rio in 1992 , I understood something of the ill effects apt to result from the extravagant burning of oil and coal . New record-setting weather extremes seem to have become as commonplace as traffic accidents , and three simple facts have long been known : the distance from the surface of the earth to the far edge of the inner atmosphere is only twelve miles ; the annual amount of carbon dioxide forced into that limited space is six billion tons ; and the ten hottest years in recorded human history have all occurred since 1980 . The facts beg a question that is as simple to ask as it is hard to answer . What do we do with what we know The question became more pointed in September , when the 2,500 climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new statement on the prospect of forthcoming catastrophe . Never before had the IPCC ( called into existence in 1988 ) come to so unambiguous a conclusion . Always in years past there had been people saying that we did n't yet know enough , or that the evidence was problematical , or our system of computer simulation was subject to too many uncertainties . Not this year . The panel flatly announced that the earth had entered a period of climatic instability likely to cause " widespread economic , social and environmental dislocation over the next century . " The continuing emission of greenhouse gases would create protracted , crop-destroying droughts in continental interiors , a host of new and recurring diseases , hurricanes of extraordinary malevolence , and rising sea levels that could inundate island nations and low-lying coastal rims on the continents . I came across the report in the New York Times during the same week that the island of St. Thomas was blasted to shambles by one of thirteen hurricanes that roiled the Caribbean this fall . Scientists speak the language of probability . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrected , reinterpreted , modified , or proven wrong . If its September announcement was uncharacteristically bold , possibly it was because the IPCC scientists understood that they were addressing their remarks to people profoundly unwilling to hear what they had to say . That resistance is understandable , given the immensity of the stakes . The energy industries now constitute the largest single enterprise known to mankind . Moreover , they are indivisible from automobile , fanning , shipping , air freight , and banking interests , as well as from the governments dependent on oil revenues for their very existence . With annual sales in excess o one trillion dollars and daily sales of more than two billion dollars , the oil industry alone supports the economies of the Middle East and large segments of the economies of Russia , Mexico , Venezuela , Nigeria , Indonesia , Norway , and Great Britain . Begin to enforce restriction on the consumption of oil and coal , and the effects on the global economy  --  unemployment , depression , social breakdown , and war  --  might lay waste to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder that for the last five or six years many of the world 's politicians and most of the world 's news media have been promoting the perception that the worries about the weather are overwrought . Ever since the IPCC first set out to devise strategies whereby the nations of the world might reduce their carbon dioxide emissions , and thus ward off a rise in the average global temperature on the order of 4 or 5 degrees Celsius ( roughly equal in magnitude to the difference between the last ice age and the current climatic period ) , the energy industry has been conducting , not unreasonably , a ferocious public relations campaign meant to sell the notion that science , any science , is always a matter of uncertainty . Yet on reading the news from the IPCC , I wondered how the oil company publicists would confront the most recent series of geophysical events and scientific findings . To wit : * 1 48-by-22-mile chunk of the Larsen Ice Shelf in the Antarctic broke off last March , exposing rocks that had been buried for 20,000 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell the Associated Press , " Last November we predicted the ice shelf would crack in ten years , but it has happened in barely two months . " * 1n April , researchers discovered a 70 percent decline in the population of zooplankton off the coast of southern California , raising questions about the survival of several species of fish that feed on it . Scientists have linked the change to a 1 to 2 degree C increase in the surface water temperature over the last four decades . * 1 recent series of articles in The Lancet , a British medical journal , linked changes in climate patterns to the spread of infectious diseases around the world . The Aedes aegypi mosquito , which spreads dengue fever and yellow fever , has traditionally been unable to survive at altitudes higher than 1,000 meters above sea level . But these mosquitoes are now being reported at 1,150 meters in Costa Rica and at 2,200 meters in Colombia . Ocean warming has triggered algae blooms linked to outbreaks of cholera in India , Bangladesh , and the Pacific coast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected more than 400,000 people . * 1n a paper published in Science in April , David J. Thomson , of the AT &T; Bell Laboratories , concluded that the .6 degree C warming of the average global temperature over the past century correlates directly with the buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide . Separate findings by a team of scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's National Climatic Data Center indicate that growing weather extremes in the United States are due , by a probability of 90 percent , to rising levels of greenhouse gases . * 1cientists previously believed that the transitions between ice ages and more moderate climatic periods occur gradually , over centuries . But researchers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , examining deep ocean sediment and ice core samples , found that these shifts , with their temperature changes of up to 7 degrees C , have occurred within three to four decades  --  a virtual nanosecond in geological time . Over the last 70,000 years , the earth 's climate has snapped into radically different temperature regimes . " Our results suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said researcher Scott Lehman . " Shifts could happen very rapidly if conditions are right , and we can not predict when that will occur . " His cautionary tone is underscored by findings that the end of the last ice age , some 8,000 years ago , was preceded by a series of extreme oscillations in which severe regional deep freezes alternated with warming spikes . As the North Atlantic warmed , Arctic snowmelts and increased rainfall diluted the salt content of the ocean , which , in turn , redirected the ocean 's warming current from a northeasterly direction to one that ran nearly due east . Should such an episode occur today , say researchers , " the present climate of Britain and Norway would change suddenly to that of Greenland . " These items ( and many like them ) would seem to be alarming news-far more important than the candidacy of Colin Powell , or even whether Newt Gingrich believes the government should feed poor children-worthy of a national debate or the sustained attention of Congress . But the signs and portents have been largely ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mass media . More often than not , the news about the accelerating retreat of the world 's glaciers or the heat-and insect-stressed Canadian forests comes qualified with the observation that the question of global warming never can be conclusively resolved . The confusion is intentional , expensively gift wrapped by the energy industries . Capital keeps its nose to the wind . The people who run the world 's oil and coal companies know that the march of science , and of political action , may be slowed by disinformation . In the last year and a half , one of the leading oil industry public relations outlets , the Global Climate Coalition , has spent more than a million dollars to downplay the threat of climate change . It expects to spend another $850,000 on the issue next year . Similarly , the National Coal Association spent more than $ ? 00,000 on he global climate issue in 1992 and 1993 . In 1993 alone , the American Petroleum Institute , just one of fifty-four industry members of the GCC , paid $1.8 million to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proposed tax on fossil fuels . For perspective , this is only slightly less than the combined yearly expenditures on global warming of the five major environmental groups that focus on climate issues  --  about $2.1 million , according to officials of the Environmental Defense Fund , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the Sierra Club , the Union of Concerned Scientists , and the World Wildlife Fund . For the most part the industry has relied on a small band of skeptics  --  Dr. Richard S. Lindzen , Dr. Pat Michaels , Dr. Robert Balling , Dr. Sherwood Idso , and Dr. S. Fred Singer , among others  --  who have proven extraordinarily adept at draining the issue of all sense of crisis . Through their frequent pronouncements in the press and on radio and television , they have helped to create the illusion that the question is hopelessly mired in unknowns . Most damaging has been their influence on decision makers ; their contrarian views have allowed conservative Republicans such as Representative Dana Rohrabacher ( R. , Calif. ) to dismiss legitimate research concerns as " liberal claptrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of budget cuts to those government science programs designed to monitor the health of the planet . Last May , Minnesota held hearings in St. Paul to determine the environmental cost of coal burning by state power plants . Three of the skeptics  --  Lindzen , Michaels , and Balling  --  were hired as expert witnesses to testify on behalf of Western Fuels Association , a $400 million consortium of coal suppliers and coal-fired utilities. ( 1 ) An especially aggressive industry player , Western Fuels was quite candid about its strategy in two annual reports : " T here has been a close to universal impulse in the trade association community here in Washington to concede the scientific premise of global warming ... while arguing over policy prescriptions that would be the least disruptive to our economy .... We have disagreed , and do disagree , with this strategy . " " When the climate change controversy first erupted ... scientists were found who are skeptical about much of what seemed generally accepted about the potential for climate change . " Among them were Michaels , Balling , and S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at MIT , testified in St. Paul that the maximum probable warming of the atmosphere in the face of a doubling of carbon dioxide emissions over the next century would Ps amount to no more than a negligible .3 degrees C. Michaels , who teaches climatology at the University of Virginia , stated that he foresaw no increase in the rate of sea level rise  --  another feared precursor of global warming . Balling , who works on climate issues at Arizona State University , declared that the increase in emissions would boost the average global temperature by no more than one degree . At first glance , these attacks appear defensible , given their focus on the black holes of uncertainty that mark our current knowledge of the planet 's exquisitely interrelated climate system . The skeptics emphasize the inadequacy of a major climate research tool known as a General Circulation Model , and our ignorance of carbon dioxide exchange between the oceans and the atmosphere and of the various roles of clouds . They have repeatedly pointed out that although the world 's output of carbon dioxide has exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global temperature . The larger scientific community , by contrast , holds that this is due to the masking effect of low-level sulfur particulates , which exert a temporary cooling effect on the earth , and to a time lag in the oceans ' absorption and release of carbon dioxide . But while the skeptics portray themselves as besieged truth-seekers fending off irresponsible environmental doomsayers , their testimony in St. Paul and elsewhere revealed the source and scope of their funding for the first time . Michaels has received more than $115,000 over the last four years from coal and energy interests . World Climate Review , a quarterly he founded that routinely debunks climate concerns , was funded by Western Fuels . Over the last six years , either alone or with colleagues , Balling has received more than $200,000 from coal and oil interests in Great Britain , Germany , and elsewhere . Balling ( along with Sherwood Idso ) has also taken money from Cyprus Minerals , a mining company that has been a major funder of People for the West  --  a militantly anti-environmental " Wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges oil and coal interests $2,500 a day for his consulting services ; his 1991 trip to testify before a Senate committee was paid for by Western Fuels , and a speech he wrote , entitled " Global Warming : the Origin and Nature of Alleged Scientific Consensus , " was underwritten by OPEC . Singer , who last winter proposed a $95,000 publicity project to " stem the tide towards ever more onerous controls on energy use , " has received consulting fees from Exxon , Shell , Unocal , ARCO , and Sun Oil , and has warned them that they . face the same threat as the chemical firms that produced chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) , a class of chemicals found to be depleting atmospheric ozone . " It took only five years to go from ... a simple freeze of production of CFCs , " Singer has written , " ... to the 1992 decision of a complete production phase-out-all on the basis of quite insubstantial science . " ( 2 ) The skeptics assert flatly that their science is untainted by funding . Nevertheless , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interchangeable ornaments on the hood of a high-powered engine of disinformation . Their dissenting opinions are amplified beyond all proportion through the media while the concerns of the dominant majority of the world 's scientific establishment are marginalized. ( 3 ) By keeping the discussion focused on whether there is a problem in the first place , they have effectively silenced the debate over what to do about it . Last spring 's IPCC conference in Berlin is a good example . Delegations from 170 nations met to negotiate targets and timetables for reducing the world 's carbon dioxide emissions . The efforts of the conference ultimately foundered on foot-dragging by the United States and Japan and active resistance from the OPEC nations . Leading the fight for the most dramatic reductions  --  to 60 percent of 1990 levels  --  was a coalition of small island nations from the Caribbean and the Pacific that fear being flooded out of existence . They were supported by most western European governments , but China and India , with their vast coal resources , argued that until the United States significantly cuts its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their obligation to the global environment . In the end , OPEC , supported by the United States , Japan , Australia , Canada , and New Zealand , rejected calls to limit emissions , declaring emission limits premature . As the natural crisis escalates , so will the forces of institutional and societal denial . If , at the cost of corporate pocket change , industrial giants can control the publicly perceived reality of the condition of the planet and the state of our scientific knowledge , what would they do if their survival were truly put at risk Billions would be spent on the creation of information and the control of politicians . Glad-handing oil company ads on the op-ed page of the New York Times ( from a quarter-page pronouncement by Mobil last September 28 : " There 's a lot of good news out there " ) would give way to a new stream of selective findings by privatized scientists . Long before the planet itself collapsed , democracy would break apart under the stress of " natural " disasters . It is not difficult to foresee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the first casualties . Thus , the question must be asked : can civilization change the way it operates ? For 5,000 years , we have thought of ourselves as dependent children of the earth , flourishing or perishing according to the whims of nature . But with the explosion of the power of our technology and the size of our population , our activities have grown to the proportion of geological forces , affecting the major systems of the planet . Short of the Atlantic washing away half of Florida , the abstract notion that the old anomalies have become the new norm is difficult to grasp . Dr. lames McCarthy of Harvard , who has supervised the work of climate scientists from sixty nations , puts it this way : " If the last 150 years had been marked by the kind of climate instability we are now seeing , the world would never have been able to support its present population of 5 billion people . " We live in a world of man-size urgencies , measured in hours or days . What unfolds slowly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will therefore take a collective act of imagination to understand the extremity of the situation we now confront . The lag time in our planet 's ecological systems will undoubtedly delay these decisions , and even if the nations of the world were to agree tomorrow on a plan to phase out oil and coal and convert to renewable energies , an equivalent lag time in human affairs would delay its implementation for years . What too many people refuse to understand is that the global economy 's existence depends upon the global environment , not the other way around . One can not negotiate jobs , development , or rates of economic growth with nature . What of the standard list of palliatives  --  carbon taxes , more energy-efficient buildings , a revival of public transportation The ideas are attractive , but the thinking is too small . Even were the United States to halve its own carbon dioxide contribution , this cutback would soon be overwhelmed by the coming development of industry and housing and schools in China and India and Mexico for all their billions of citizens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources for the development of all the world 's nations . So here is an informal proposal  --  at best a starting point for a conversation  --  from one man who is not an expert . What if we turned the deserts of the world into electricity farms ? Let the Middle East countries keep their oil royalties as solar royalties . What if the world mobilized around a ten-year project to phase out all fossil fuels , to develop renewable energy technologies , to extend those technologies to every corner of the world ? What if , to minimize the conflict of so massive a dislocation , the world 's energy companies were put in charge of the transition  --  answering only to an international regulatory body and an enforceable timetable ? Grant them the same profit margins for solar electricity and hydrogen fuel they now receive for petroleum and coal . Give them the licenses for all renewable energy technologies . Assure them the same relative position in the world 's economy they now enjoy at the end of the project . Are these ideas mere dream Perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago a significant fraction of humanity overturned its Communist system in a historical blink of an eye . Eight years ago the world 's governments joined together in Montreal to regulate CFCs . Technology is not the issue . The atomic bomb was developed in two and a half years . Putting a man on the moon took eleven . Surely , given the same sense of urgency , we can develop new energy systems in ten years . Most of the technology is already available to us or soon will be . We have the knowledge , he energy , and the hunger for jobs to get it done . And we are different in one unmeasurable way from previous generations : ours is the first to be educated about the larger world by the global reach of electronic information . The leaders of the oil and coal industry , along with their skeptical scientists , relentlessly accuse environmentalists of overstating the climatic threat to destroy capitalism . Must a transformation that is merely technological dislodge the keystone of the economic order I do n't know . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . To transform our economy would oblige us to understand the limits of the planet . That understanding alone might seed the culture with a more organic concept of ourselves and our connectedness to the earth . And corporations , it is useful to remember , are not only obstacles on the road to the future . They are also crucibles of technology and organizing engines of production , the modem expression of mankind 's drive for creativity . The industrialist is no less human than the poet , and both the climate scientist and the oil company operator inhabit the same planet , suffer the same short life span , harbor the same hopes for their children . Each summer , our family walks the deep north Maine woods in search of adventure and a sense of renewal . The trip this year was different for me ; I was visited by premonitions of the coming sickness of the forests , haunted by unwelcome and indescribably sad imaginings . They intruded at unexpected moments . One night while listening to a dialogue of loons on a black lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Struck by the recognition of how fragile was the frame of the world , and how easily it could be shattered by our mutual distrust and confusion , I feared that the cause of survival would be lost to the greed and alienation and shortsightedness that dog our few last steps to the threshold of the millennium . My dream of reconfiguring the global economy was probably nothing more than the hopeless longing of a reporter , not a social thinker or macroeconomic engineer . But I am also a husband and a father , a son , and a grandson . And someday perhaps a grandfather . Our history is rich with visionaries urging us to change our ways of thinking , asking questions about the meaning of the past and the shape of the future . Now the questions are being posed , in a language we do n't yet fully understand , by the oceans . I have promised myself that next summer I will keep my lawn watered , at least as long as the water holds out . 1 In 1991 , Western Fuels spent an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Greening of Planet Earth , " which was shown frequently inside the Bush White House as well as within the governments of OPEC . In near-evangelical tones , the video promises that a new age of agricultural abundance will result from increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide . It portrays a world where vast areas of desert are reclaimed by the carbon dioxide-forced growth of new grasslands , where the earth 's diminishing forests are replenished by a nurturing atmosphere . Unfortunately , it overlooks the bugs . Experts note that even a minor elevation in temperature would trigger an explosion in the planet 's insect population , leading to potentially significant disruptions in food supplies from crop damage as well as to a surge in insect-borne diseases . It appears that Western Fuels ' video fails to tell people what the termites in New Orleans may be trying to tell them now . 2 Contrary to his assertion , however , virtually all relevant researchers say the link between CFCs and ozone depletion is based on unassailably solid scientific evidence . As if to underscore the point , in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last winter 's ozone loss will result in about 80,000 additional cases of skin cancer in Europe . This fall , the three scientists who discovered the CFC-ozone link won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry . 3 The industry 's public relations arsenal , however , is made up of much more than a few sympathetic scientists . Last March , the Global Climate Coalition distributed a report by Accu-Weather Inc. that denied any significant increase in extreme weather events . The report flies in the face of contradictory evidence cited by officials of the insurance industry which , during the 1980s , paid an average of $3 billion a year to victims of natural disasters  --  a figure that has jumped to $10 billion a year in this decade . A to official of a Swiss reinsurance firm told the World Watch Institute : " There is a significant body of scientific evidence indicating that the recent record insured loss from natural catastrophes was not a random occurrence . " More succinctly , the president of the Reinsurance Association of America said climate change " could bankrupt the industry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
