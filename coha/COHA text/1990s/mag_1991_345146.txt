Revolutions are messy affairs that may go on for years with climax after climax before a stable new regime is finally established . But along the way they pass distinct turning points at which it becomes clear that the old order is gone beyond any hope of resurrection , and the future 's possible shape , however vague and tentative , comes into view . So it was last week in the Soviet Union , late superpower and communist totalitarian state ruled from Moscow . <P> Since the failed coup in August , the country has been writhing in a last agony that , in the words of Russian President Boris Yeltsin , seemed to drag on " through some sort of sick eternity . " Finally Yeltsin and the Presidents of Ukraine and Belorussia  --  founding republics of the old union in 1922 and still its Slavic core  --  decided to sign a death certificate : " The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality , is ceasing its existence . " <P> That announcement , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independent States , came as a stunning surprise but hardly a shock . The power had long been leaching out of the central authority in the Kremlin , and it was the leaders of the key republics that everyone looked to for salvation . The fear was that they would prove too determinedly nationalistic to come together in any kind of practical alliance . Yet Yeltsin and company came up with a proposal that all the independent republics could embrace  --  if they wanted . <P> Through it all , Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev fought to hold off the burial of the state he officially ruled . " I 'll use all my political and legal authority " to keep playing a major role , he said in an interview with TIME . But his position now seemed largely irrelevant . Whether he resigns in short order , as is widely expected , or continues to sit in his Moscow office a while longer , his political and legal authority is virtually gone , and there is nothing much left for him to preside over . <P> At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old union began to take shape . The new commonwealth formed by the three Slavic republics would supposedly coordinate  --  but not dictate  --  the economic , military and foreign policies of its sovereign members . To dramatize the break from the communist  --  and before that , Russian imperial  --  past , the Presidents decided that the commonwealth 's coordinating bodies , yet to be formed , would be based not in Moscow , the Soviet capital , nor in the czarist capital of St. Petersburg , but in the plain-Jane , utilitarian Belorussian city of Minsk .
