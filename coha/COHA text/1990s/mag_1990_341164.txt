On one level Nelson Mandela is merely a man of extraordinary courage whose commitment to racial justice never flagged during 27 years in South African prisons . In another sense he is a " loyal and disciplined member " of the African National Congress , a dedicated revolutionary who humbly submits to the collective leadership of the antiapartheid group . But on a more transcendent plane , where history is made and myths are forged , Mandela is a hero , a man , like those described by author Joseph Campbell , who has emerged from a symbolic grave " reborn , made great and filled with creative power . " <P> In this era of cynicism , such legendary figures have all but disappeared in the U.S. Martyrdom at an early age was necessary to lift John and Robert Kennedy , Martin Luther King Jr . and Malcolm X to the status of secular saints . Mandela is unique among heroes because he is a living embodiment of black liberation . Like Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer enjoying their own eulogies from a hiding place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide throng yearning to , if not touch the hem of his garment , at least catch a glimpse of him whirring by in a motorcade . <P> Mandela may lack the rousing , bred-in-the-pulpit style of black orators like King or Jesse Jackson . His soft-spoken manner and unflappable dignity bespeak his background as a lawyer , a single-minded political organizer and a longtime prisoner still blinking a bit in the spotlight . But Mandela 's magnetism is palpable , the consequence of his endurance and determination in the fight against South Africa 's white-minority government . He fires the pride of African Americans and touches a deep desire in the psyche of Americans both black and white for a leader who might rekindle the biracial coalition that destroyed their country 's own version of apartheid a generation ago , then fell apart during the long , hot summers of the ' 60s . <P> Such yearnings help explain the torrent of emotion that erupted when Mandela arrived in New York City last week on the first leg of a twelve-day , eight- city U.S. tour . For one brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a series of violent racial incidents seemed to vibrate with one voice shouting " Mandela ! " More than 750,000 people lined the streets of lower Manhattan as Mandela sped by in a bulletproof glass chamber borne on a flatbed truck . At a rally on the steps of City Hall , Mandela was presented with the key to the city by Mayor David Dinkins , one of the five African-American mayors who will welcome him on his trip ( a sixth , Marion Barry of Washington , will be too embroiled in his trial on drug-possession and perjury charges to take part in his city 's celebration ) . <P> The next day Mandela captivated more than 3,000 people gathered at Riverside Church by joining in an exuberant rendition of the toyi-toyi , a South African dance of celebration . That night 100,000 people jammed Harlem 's Africa Square , content to gaze at the visiting hero whose voice could barely be heard over a feeble public-address system . Later , 50,000 cheered Mandela at a rally in Yankee Stadium , where he delighted his audience by donning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . I am a Yankee ! "
