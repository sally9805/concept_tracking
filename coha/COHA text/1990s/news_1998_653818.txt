<p> AFTER a bout of winter blues that has dragged on for much of the last decade , European business has finally come back to life . <p> The best evidence is in the Continent 's stock markets . From Spain to Germany , market indexes have outpaced those in the United States , with some climbing a third or more in just the last six months . <p> But the boom in Europe is more than a bull market . Europe is going through at least four historic financial transformations  --  each of which is likely to alter the investment landscape for years to come , all of them likely to benefit investors : CURRENCY UNION On Jan. 1 , some 11 nations led by France and Germany will adopt the euro as a common currency , creating a unified economic entity almost as big as the United States . The euro looms behind every other major trend in Europe , accelerating the broad movement toward greater competition and free-market capitalism . ECONOMIC CONVERGENCE For the first time this century , interest rates and inflation are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany . Thanks largely to the stringent economic requirements for joining the " euro club , " governments across the Continent sharply reduced budget deficits and yoked themselves to austere monetary policies . Now the reward is at hand , in the form of faster growth and stable prices . CORPORATE OVERHAUL Under growing competitive pressure worldwide , European conglomerates are embracing Wall Street 's priorities : profits and the concept of " shareholder value . " Companies that once were opaque to many investors are now listing their shares in New York and opening up their books . They are also slashing costs , selling off businesses that do not perform and merging like mad to shore up the rest . <p> The revamping has cost millions of European workers their jobs , and companies are still not as profitable , on average , as their American counterparts . But the renewed strength is measurable . A STAMPEDE TOWARD STOCKS Perhaps the most profound change is the surge in equity investing by individual Europeans . As recently as two years ago , Europeans avoided stocks in favor of cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock markets with tens of billions of dollars , and most analysts expect the torrent to become even bigger in the next few years . <p> Analysts say the deluge has been driven by two big changes . One is lower interest rates , which have eroded returns on bonds . The second is the growing weakness in government-run pension programs , which are amassing mountains of commitments without the means to honor them . The result is a rush to mutual funds and a political trend toward promoting American-style private pension funds , which in turn become huge buyers of equities . <p> " You are looking at a set of circumstances that occur only a few times a century , " said Phil De Cristo , head of operations in Continental Europe for Fidelity Investments . " We look at Europe as being our prime engine of growth over the next five years . " <p> None of that means that Europe is a safe bet . For one thing , prices have climbed so far , so fast , that some markets may already be dangerously overvalued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new European Central Bank will establish stability and credibility for the euro , there is still ample room for problems . And even if the euro proceeds according to plan , it will create losers as well as winners . <p> Even so , European economic prospects are better than they have been in years . Total economic growth should reach 3 percent this year , possibly outpacing growth in the United States . Already , annual growth rates for Portugal , Spain and Finland are rising by about 4 percent , while Ireland is up by more than 8 percent . <p> " If you combine the prospects for economic growth , low budget deficits , low or negligible inflation and low interest rates , you have an economic proposition that is almost embarrassingly rich , " said George Hodgson , head of equity research at the Dutch bank ABN-Amro . Here Comes the Euro <p> Though the debut of the euro next year will have little direct impact on Europe 's growth and prosperity , the preparations have had a huge effect on governments , companies and investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return on May 3 , when they formally decided to introduce the euro on Jan. 1 as the currency of 11 countries : Germany , France , Italy , Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg , Austria , Spain , Portugal , Ireland and Finland . <p> Britain , Denmark and Sweden decided to stay out of the monetary union , though they met the qualifications to join . Greece was the only member of the European Union that could not meet the standards , and it hopes to join in several years . <p> The euro has already transformed economic policy across the Continent , as governments slashed budget deficits and generous social programs . In the process , inflation was nearly eliminated in historically turbulent countries like Spain , Italy and Portugal . Interest rates in these so-called " Club Med " countries have plunged by half in just two years . Not surprisingly , stock markets in Madrid , Lisbon and Milan have soared faster than almost any others in Europe in the last year . <p> The advent of the euro also promises to alter profoundly Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not begin to circulate until 2002 , stocks and bonds will be traded in euros on Jan. 1 . In effect , that creates a huge new European market for stocks and bonds that could eventually rival Wall Street in global importance . <p> " With the European Union , what we are talking about is redefining the idea of a home market , " said Mr. De Cristo of Fidelity . " You are creating a massive new entity , which is Europe or Euroland . " <p> For corporations trying to raise capital , that is both good and bad news . On the one hand , it makes it easier to tap a much bigger pool of potential investors . But it also exposes them to bruising new international comparisons . <p> According to Salomon Smith Barney , for example , the average return on equity for Italian companies was about 9.9 percent last year . By contrast , German companies earned about 12 percent and Finnish companies earned nearly 21 percent . ( In the United States , return on equity averaged about 20 percent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the real world , the market for goods and services . Even though the European Union already permits almost entirely free trade between member nations , the babble of different currencies continues to cloak price differences between identical products in different markets . In Germany , a cottage industry of automobile " re-importers " buys up Mercedeses and Volkswagens in neighboring countries and then re-sells them to Germans at prices lower than those of German car dealers . <p> In the new Europe , the camouflage disappears and price pressures are expected to increase . " The single currency will put pressure on manufacturers , " acknowledged Manfred Gentz , the chief financial officer of Daimler-Benz . " But the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages , and that kind of competition is healthy anyway . " <p> It had better be , because the scramble for position in the pan-European market has contributed to an accelerated pace of mergers and acquisitions . Daimler-Benz 's stunning deal to take over the Chrysler Corporation , the third-largest American auto maker , was merely the most visible of many huge deals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical companies and steel producers . In dollars , the value of European mergers jumped to $484 billion in 1997 , from about $170 billion in 1994 . <p> " The whole philosophy behind the single market was to enable European companies to enjoy the same economies of scale that companies in the United States and Japan were perceived to enjoy , " said Mark Howdle , head of European equity strategy at Salomon Smith Barney . <p> When they are not merging , Europe 's industrial conglomerates have become increasingly preoccupied with improving their performance . One example : Royal Philips Electronics , the Dutch manufacturer of consumer electronics , saw profits nearly evaporate two years ago as a result of several flopped products and a disastrous alliance with Grundig A.G. , the troubled German manufacturer . After severing ties to Grundig and cutting 6,000 jobs , Philips has bounced back with high profits and a soaring stock price . <p> While individual stories do not add up to a trend , there are broader signs of improvement . Excluding Britain , Europe has seen corporate return on equity climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 percent in 1996 , according to Salomon Smith Barney . <p> But that remains well behind performance in the United States , and pessimists interpret the numbers to mean that Continental Europe remains shy about serious revamping . <p> Optimists , though , see the data as evidence that European companies still have much opportunity for rapid increases in profitability . " The party is only beginning , " said Mr. Hodgson . Winning Fabulous Prizes <p> " We call it the Stock Market Game , but we take it very seriously , " said Peter Nemec , host and producer of " 3 Sat Borse " , Germany 's most popular television show for investors . A lot of other people take it seriously , too . <p> Every Friday night over a six-month period , three investment advisers compete on Mr. Nemec 's show , offering their best stock picks . Each adviser is given an imaginary pot of 100,000 German marks , and the one whose pot is biggest at the end of six months wins the game . <p> Once upon a time , few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million viewers tune in . And when contestants tout their newest favorites , traders say , those stocks routinely surge on Monday morning . <p> " The public has finally discovered stocks , " exulted Mr. Nemec , who could barely scrape together 100,000 viewers when he started in 1988 . " When I go to shopping on Saturdays , the shopkeepers recognize me and start asking me what stocks they should buy . " <p> It is difficult to overstate the change in mind-set among investors in Germany , and , indeed , across most of Continental Europe . European investors who till recently favored the safety of bonds are a key force behind the bull market . Last year , they poured more than $70 billion into stock-oriented mutual funds , up from just $10 billion in 1996 . In Italy , where interest rates have plunged by more than half in the last year , $7 billion flowed into stock funds in April alone . Spanish investors have been on a similar rampage . <p> In Germany , private households have more than doubled their stock holdings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Deutsche Bank started a new mutual fund for small European stocks last April , investors contributed more than $300 million in the first few days . <p> Such lemming-like behavior often is observed in overripe markets . And Europe 's mobilization of money does not necessarily mean that its markets will continue to soar . <p> " Liquidity can be a dangerous animal , " Mr. Hodgson said . After all , in an electronic marketplace where trillions of dollars move around the world every day , mutual fund and pension managers routinely redirect their money when conditions change . <p> Analysts also note that stock valuations are at historic highs in both Europe and the United States . Spain 's red-hot stock market has retreated about 10 percent in the last month , apparently because investors became convinced that stock prices had lost touch with reality . <p> " European valuations look very rich , " said David Bowers , an equity strategist for Merrill Lynch in London . " There is n't much room for disappointment . " <p> But there are echoes in Europe 's boom that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they say , is reminiscent of what happened in the United States during the early 1980 's , when inflation finally subsided and the bull market began to take off . As in the United States , European investors have proved dissatisfied with diminishing bond returns and low interest rates on savings . <p> " People who have gotten along on gilt-edged bonds suddenly realize that they have to get their returns up , " said Jonathan Freeman , an investment banker at Beeson Gregory , a London-based stock brokerage firm . " It is a new game for a lot of people , but I think you are going to see it for a long time . " <p> A flood of money is pouring into European stocks as European companies grow more efficient , merger-and-acquisi-tions activity explodes , and the Continent 's economic expansion gains strength .
