EVEN WHILE THE 102ND CONGRESS RACED TO ADjourn for the campaign finale , the Democrats somehow found time to stick controversial issues smack into President Bush 's face . They did n't win many fights , but they did raise the discomfort level in the White House to record levels . To the Republicans ' collective relief , the family-leave bill died on Wednesday when the House failed to override Bush 's veto of the legislation , which the White House opposed as antibusiness . On Friday the House left Bush 's abortion " gag rule " in place , again failing to muster the necessary two-thirds vote to overturn the legislation , which bars abortion counseling by nonphysician workers in federally funded family-planning clinics . The vote came the day after the Administration 's curb on such funding took effect . Bush 's Saturday veto of a bill reregulating cable TV just might be overridden ; it was first passed by a more than 2-to-1 vote in both houses .                  @ @ @
