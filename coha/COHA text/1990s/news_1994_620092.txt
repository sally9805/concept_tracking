<p> As a schoolboy in downtown Oakland , Ted Dang used to buy up all the comic books as they appeared at his neighborhood store . He would hold them for a while , then sell as scarcity drove their prices up . A capitalist was born . <p> " We bought for a nickel , sold for a quarter , " the candidate for Oakland mayor recalled . " Soon , the quarter became a dollar , two dollars . We speculated in comic books . . . I developed my real-estate instincts from comic books . " <p> During the past 20 years , Dang and his real-estate partners have swapped enough Oakland properties to turn from $ 1 million to $ 2 million in profits in the transactions , public records show . They have also collected substantial rental income from properties along the way . <p> Their current holdings  --  land , apartments , condominiums , mid- rise office buildings  --  have an assessed value of at least $ 8 million . Almost all of Dang 's enterprises are located within walking distance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Dang grew up in the 1950s and ' 60s . <p> Although the 43-year-old Dang has never held elective office , his activities as a business leader have sometimes forced him to make tough decisions about whether a touch of social compassion can restrain  --  or cultivate  --  a healthy economic environment . Both his admirers and detractors have been looking at his business history for insight into how he might run Oakland if he defeats Mayor Elihu Harris on November 8 . <p> Like most people , Dang has his contradictions : He is at ease in any crowd , but at times he has been accused of putting profit ahead of people . He has cultivated political support for his projects , then come to view City Hall as a den of wastrels . He is known as a cool-headed negotiator , but his decision to run for mayor was born of anger at Harris and at business colleagues who he believed were backing the incumbent for self-serving reasons . <p> The businessman who built deals by bringing people together has become a hard-hitting candidate whose chances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by stoking emotions about crime , poverty and politicians . <p> FRUGAL FAMILY <p> Born into a frugal family , Dang said he " got into business to make money and to be a success . " His dream was to be able to go into a department store and buy anything without worrying about how much it cost . <p> His fascination with real estate led to a business degree from the University of California at Berkeley , but corporate recruiters passed over Dang when he went looking for work . He was the wrong ethnicity , Dang figured , and he lacked social standing . When Dang finally got a job , it was with a small , Asian-owned company . <p> Dang built his success by pooling his cash and that of close family members and friends , by his willingness to be not only a developer but also a contractor , realtor and property manager , and by an intimate knowledge of the flow of money and people in Oakland 's growing Chinese American community . <p> He estimates he has done 25 real-estate transactions on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each in vivid detail . <p> " Every one of them has made money , " he said . " The minimum return has been 10 percent after taxes . On some deals , we 've put down a couple hundred thousand and it 's come back three or four times . " <p> Dang built his fortune primarily by building low-cost condominiums and investing in rental property . His projects are distinguished by their austerity . <p> In the 1980s , Dang was known around Chinatown as a can't-miss investor . He never advertised , and he did not have to ; friends and relatives bought shares in his deals for $ 5,000 to $ 100,000 , and soon small investors in China , Taiwan , Hong Kong and Japan were joining them . <p> EXPANSION TO OTHER ' FARMS ' <p> His success enabled him to expand to two other neighborhoods , or " farms , " as he calls them : east of Lake Merritt and the central business district . " When I get into a ' farm , ' " he said , " I work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community aspect . " <p> As he climbed , Dang shared his wealth and his expertise with Chinese American community organizations  --  in San Francisco as well as in Oakland . He estimates that his donations of time , property and cash run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars . <p> When Dang calls himself a capitalist with heart , he refers not only to his charitable activities . He includes the choices he has made as a developer and landlord providing affordable housing  --  choices critics have often faulted . <p> For example , one of Dang 's groups built condominiums at 2586 Foothill Boulevard , in the census tract with the city 's fifth-highest percentage of people living below poverty . The project measurably boosted the number of owner-occupied homes in the neighborhood . Dang doubled his money . <p> NEIGHBORHOOD COMPLAINTS <p> A neighborhood group complained that the condos were cheaply built and badly designed . Dang said the critics seem to forget that the homes were opportunities for first-time buyers in a poor part of town . " What do you expect for $ 99,000 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has made as a businessman could be a liability for someone running for the highest office in a city with as wide an ethnic and economic range as Oakland . He evicted a pregnant woman from an apartment building he was converting to condominiums . He left apartments vacant rather than rent to " welfare tenants . " He twice fought the city to build more condominiums than the zoning allowed , combining a frank desire for profit with a moral conviction that he was providing a product Oakland families desperately needed . <p> Dang is " basically a fair person  --  but definitely a businessman , " one associate said . <p> FRUSTRATION GREW <p> After 1989 , success gave way to frustration . Dang 's downtown properties lost millions in paper value as upwardly mobile tenants deserted Oakland or moved to better buildings at rents they could suddenly afford . Dang had long held political ambitions and had been groomed to take over council member Frank Ogawa 's seat . The squeeze he was in , coupled with his outrage at the business community 's dalliance with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . <p> Dang had grown wealthy and shared his fortune with the community he never left , but the deals were drying up . He now blamed crime and Oakland 's prolonged recession for vacancies that sapped his profits . He had just fought a costly war of wills with a neighborhood organization over his latest condominium development , and faced his first financial setback as a developer . On top of it all , City Hall was a changed place , with some of Dang 's political allies removed from office and a new guard in place that was not inclined to make decisions on purely economic grounds . <p> " The economy stinks , but Oakland stinks , too , " griped Dang . <p> The $ 114,500 in personal funds Dang has lent to his campaign is really his latest investment , albeit an unusually high-risk venture for the normally cautious businessman . If he loses , Dang will have set himself back financially at a time when he is ready to turn over his businesses to a successor . <p> " In hindsight , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I could have retired very easily . Now , I 've got to struggle . " <p> HOW TED DANG MIXES BUSINESS DECISIONS WITH SOCIAL CONCERNS <p> Oakland mayoral candidate Ted Dang calls himself a " businessman with a social conscience . " But a few of his 50 business deals have run into controversy over legal or political questions . Here are several examples of how Dang has weighed competing values in his business decisions . <p> 1980 : Dang forbids a pregnant woman to remain in an apartment building he plans to convert to condominiums at 427 Lagunitas Avenue . <p> In his first project as a developer , Dang persuaded his sister-in-law , Helen Dang , to convert her 20-unit apartment building to condominiums . In most ways , the project was a big success . Helen made money . Dang and his wife Sandra even lived in the penthouse for years . Almost half of the original buyers still live in the building . <p> But one of the original tenants , Rosaleen Phillips , accused Dang in a lawsuit of kicking her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1989 , an Alameda County Superior Court awarded her a $ 40,000 judgment against Dang and his family-owned Tomorrow Development Co . <p> The no-children clause in the condominium agreement conflicted with an Oakland law that prohibited housing discrimination against children . <p> Dang partly blames the lawyer who wrote the condo contract . He also faults Phillips : " I was torn between my obligations to the buyers and to Rosaleen Phillips . I could n't feel too sympathetic , because when she signed the rental agreement , she knew this was a no-children building . " <p> 1988 : Dang fights to build more units than the zoning allows , triggering a battle with a neighborhood group . After his success at 427 Lagunitas , Dang saw the need for low-cost housing for first-time buyers in the neighborhood east of Lake Merritt now known as Little Chinatown . <p> In 1980 , the planning commission approved his group 's plans for eight condos at 336 East 15th Street . The city 's staff had recommended denial , since the zoning called for no more than five units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the investors had to buy back five of the eight . <p> In 1988 , Dang asked the city for a variance to build 14 condominiums on a lot at 1445 5th Avenue . The zoning code allowed no more than 10 units . The planning commission turned him down . <p> But Dang argued there was an " overwhelming need for housing in the area . " He also told city planning commissioners , " As you know , the more units you can sell , the more money you can make . " <p> The City Council overrruled the commission . The Brooklyn Neighborhood Preservation Association then sued successfully to hold the project to 10 units . <p> " Easiest case of my career , because it was so blatant , " said Linda Bytof , the association 's lawyer . <p> Dang said the association did not represent the sentiments of most people in the neighborhood . <p> 1993 : Soil with elevated levels of lead is found on a lot in East Oakland after one of Dang 's companies sells it to a non-profit housing developer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none now that Dang was responsible for the tainted fill somebody dumped at 430 28th Street . Dang blamed it on a previous owner , who claims he never had anything to do with the property . <p> The developer , Dignity Housing West Inc. , had to borrow from the city to pay for the cleanup . The city made the loan on condition that Dignity take legal action , if necessary , against the responsible prior owner  --  whoever it may be . Dang said he has been notified that Dignity intends to sue him . <p> " I do n't any feel any moral or legal obligation for the toxic cleanup , but I do feel badly they got stuck with the old maid , " said Dang , who bought the vacant lot in 1989 for $ 190,000 and sold it three years later for $ 355,000 . " I offered a token , and my free services for their next project . They felt that was n't enough . " <p> 1994 : Dang restores a fire-damaged building but decides to keep some apartments vacant because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what it used to be . <p> Eight tenants were injured in the 1993 fire at apartments on 1770 Broadway owned by a Dang partnership . The city found that the fire was probably caused by an electrical overload . Tenants had complained of frequent problems with the electrical system . Two sued and won $ 5,000 judgments ; Dang settled out of court . <p> " I will not accept welfare tenants , or people who are not working , or people who have some other problems , " Dang said . " I 'd rather leave them vacant . We 've been that route . We 've relaxed the criteria  --  we end up evicting them . " <p> Dang refers people he turns away to the East Bay Asian Local Development Corp. , a non-profit developer
