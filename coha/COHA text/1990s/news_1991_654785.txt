<p> THE small bird struggles weakly against its rescuer 's grip , but exhaustion robs its pecks of any force . The grebe 's feathers are spiky with tar , its normally round red eyes drawn to a slit by dehydration . An early victim of the Persian Gulf oil spill , the bird symbolizes the environmental challenge . <p> In a hastily converted workers ' canteen here - now smelling strongly of oil and old fish - wildlife activists from many countries have set up a rescue center to clean fouled sea birds . <p> " We 've got a dirty area , a clean area , and a lovely fish kitchen . We 're ready to roll , " British expert Tim Thomas told a group of volunteers last week as they donned overalls and surgeons ' rubber gloves to begin the painstaking work of washing birds off - feather by feather - with detergent and warm water . <p> They are dealing , environmentalists say , with only the very first effects of what is almost certainly the largest oil spill in history . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is estimated to contain 11 million barrels ( 462 million gallons ) . The Exxon Valdez , by comparison , leaked 250,000 barrels . <p> Nor could it have happened in a worse place . Almost landlocked by the narrow Straits of Hormuz , the Gulf takes more than three years to flush itself out . Its waters are shallow - averaging only 100 feet - and unusually salty . <p> " This is a very fragile , stressed area of water , " explains Mohammed Bakr Amin , head of the Water Resources and Environment Research Department at the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Mineral Resources in Dhahran , Saudi Arabia , on the Gulf coast . <p> " Everything living in the Gulf is already on the threshold . You can imagine the impact of another source of pollution , " he adds . <p> " It is obvious that the world is witnessing an ecological disaster of an unprecedented scale , " warns a report from the Saudi National Commission for Wildlife Conservation and Development . Coral reefs , mangrove thickets , and beds of seagrass - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf - could end up blanketed by a deadly coat of oil . <p> That would be fatal not only to the grebes and cormorants currently in care here , but also to the fish and shrimp that provide a living for fishermen the length of the Gulf coast , to turtles , dolphins , and dugongs - an endangered species of sea cow . <p> Although the wildlife agency report predicts a " catastrophic die-off " for such species , environmentalists say it is still much too early to predict the full extent of the devastation . <p> Such an assessment is complicated and time consuming in the best of circumstances , and the war now raging in the Gulf makes it practically impossible . <p> " Nobody has ever contemplated such an amount ( of oil ) and you can not even survey it properly because you need to go far up north , " complains Prince Abdullah bin Faisal , head of the royal commission that built the industrial town of Al Jubail . " And if our environmentalists went up there they would be shot at from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the border say they did come under fire from Iraqi guns last week . <p> The Saudi government 's reaction , when the spill began to threaten the eastern coastline at the end of January , was to protect the vital industrial installations that draw water from the Gulf . <p> Protective booms were stretched first across the water intakes of desalination plants that provide drinking water to this desert nation and across the entrance to electricity generating plants . Both would be crippled if they were fouled by oil , threatening strategically critical water and power shortages in time of war . <p> Whether the booms will be fully effective remains to be seen , but once they were in place , the authorities turned their attention to protecting the environmentally sensitive areas of the coastline . <p> In doing so , they have counted on help from a wide range of foreign countries . The United States has sent a team of oil-spill experts from the Coast Guard and other agencies to assist the Saudi Environmental Administration . A Norwegian skimmer boat is operating , and Norwegians are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards beaches . The Japanese have sent six plane-loads of booms , a Soviet skimmer boat is on its way to implement plans drawn up by Dutch experts , and British birders are playing a key role at the animal rescue center in Jubail . <p> The booms are being laid in an effort to keep the slick away from the most critical areas for Gulf wildlife . These include mangrove thickets , whose tangle of roots provides a natural breakwater and an ideal nursery for many kinds of deep-water fish . The beds of seagrass that sway above the sandy bottom sustain armies of crustaceans , turtles , and dugongs . <p> Dugongs , a kind of sea cow , are some of the world 's gentlest and most helpless animals . Slow moving , and much prized for its meat , the dugong is related to the manatee found off the coast of Florida and feeds exclusively on seagrass . <p> The coral reefs that ring some of the islands off the Saudi shore are feeding grounds for countless species of fish , and many of the beaches they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins , the hawksbills . <p> The coastal mud flats and islands , meanwhile , are important as breeding grounds for birds such as the endangered Socotra cormorant , as a winter refuge for flamingoes , and as a ' refueling stop ' for millions of migrating birds every year . <p> Telling the ships where to lay their booms is a team of scientists at King Fahd University . Using a computer program designed to track mines laid in the Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war , the modeling team feeds in data on wind speed and direction , currents , and other factors to predict which beaches the slick will threaten and when . <p> It is harder , though , to predict how the weather will affect the slick and change its nature . The heat of the sun will evaporate more volatile elements to leave a more viscous sludge behind , the wind will break the slick into smaller patches , and wave action will eventually grind them into tarballs . <p> HOW long all this might take , however , is anybody 's guess . At issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , to help the ocean digest the oil . <p> Dr. Bakr Amin has his doubts . " If we were dealing with a small area perhaps we could use dispersants , but with this slick we 'd have to use huge amounts that would affect the marine life , " he says . " All dispersants I know of have harmful collateral effects . " <p> The chances of actually cleaning up much of the oil seem slim , although boats are already at work , sucking up oily water for later disposal onshore . US Coast Guard Capt . Don Jensen , head of the interagency US team working with the Saudis , pointed out recently that " in the best of situations the best we 've ever done is to recover 10 to 15 per cent " of a spill . <p> Relying on mechanical protections such as booms to keep the bulk of the oil off the beaches is about all even the most expert expert can do at this stage . <p> And even if boomswork , the oil is not going to go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in layers on the seabed , or as floating tarballs , the largest oil slick in history is likely to have ecological aftereffects every bit as dramatic as the political aftereffects of the Gulf war . <p> As Prince Abdullah bin Faisal warns , " we have a battle in front of us for a long time to come .
