As Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman sat in an upstate New York prison infirmary complaining about the food and the timing of his insulin injections , halfway around the world President Hosni Mubarak cracked down decisively on the sheik 's fundamentalist followers in Egypt . Seven men , one just 18 years old , were hanged , beginning at dawn last Thursday , on charges of attacking foreign tourists and conspiring to assassinate government officials . Thirteen more have been sentenced to death , and 770 are about to go on trial before military tribunals . " This is remarkable , serious stuff , " says Robert Satloff , director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy . " There is clearly an effort in Cairo to cut the legs off the Islamic movement . " <P> Frustrated for months by Sheik Abdel Rahman 's growing visibility , enhanced by his ties to some suspects in the World Trade Center bombing and the foiled conspiracy to bomb a handful of other New York City sites , Mubarak was also impatient with the presumption of innocence accorded the sheik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detain the blind diabetic cleric , however , Mubarak approved the executions , apparently calculating that a Sheik Abdel Rahman in jail was far less likely to make trouble for him than one on the loose . <P> Just how long that calculation will hold is now up to a phalanx of lawyers . Last Friday the Board of Immigration Appeals in Washington rejected the sheik 's bid for asylum and upheld a March ruling that he could be deported . He can appeal in federal court  --  but that process could be short-circuited by an extradition request filed in early July by Egypt . Cairo has requested his return to stand trial for inciting a 1989 riot outside a mosque in Faiyum , southwest of the capital . But Abdel Rahman is almost certain to fight extradition on grounds that he is charged with a political crime . If in the &lt; end he is deported rather than extradited , the sheik can argue it should be to Sudan , since his last visa was issued in Khartoum , now a hot spot of Islamic fundamentalism . <P> As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  anywhere  --  is a far safer place for the sheik to be . Since he first rose to global prominence last February , the state-influenced Egyptian press has been warning darkly of a " crisis " in U.S.-Egyptian relations . Rattled by reports in the U.S. media that depicted Abdel Rahman as " a new Khomeini " and Egypt as a state on the edge of a fundamentalist revolution , Egyptians sniped back that the Americans were bungling the entire affair and turning an otherwise inconsequential cleric into a hero for Egypt 's disaffected youth . Mubarak was quoted in the Egyptian press as saying " the sheik has been a CIA agent since his days in Afghanistan . The visa he got was not issued by mistake . It is because of the services he did .
