With 12 minutes left in the Kansas City Chief- Denver Bronco game at Mile High Stadium on Sunday , sportswriter Reggie Rivers burst through the left side of the Chiefs ' line and blocked Bryan Barker 's punt . The play set up Bronco quarterback John Elway 's 25th career fourth-quarter game-winning drive and took participatory journalism into a new realm . // Rivers the scribe ( his weekly sports column appears in a dozen newspapers ) doubles as a third-year special teams player and reserve running back for the Broncos , and this was clearly the most important career move of his life . Not only did his block give the ball to Denver at the Chiefs ' 11-yard line  --  three plays later Elway would throw a short touchdown pass to tight end Shannon Sharpe , giving the Broncos a 24-21 lead en route to a 27-21 victory  --  but it also provided Rivers with fodder for this weekend 's column . // " I blocked that ball with my hands , " the writer said in the locker room afterward . " I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to hold him up , so he released wide . He probably thought he beat me . " The ball rocketed backward off Rivers 's hand , then Barker inexplicably swatted it toward his own end zone before the Chiefs ' Todd McNair grabbed it and was tackled at his 11-yard line for a 47-yard loss . The play resulted in a net gain of some 80 yards in field position for the Broncos , as well as a mighty swing in momentum , and the thoughtful Rivers considered this after his shower . " I should get that as rushing yards , do n't you think ? " he said politely to the assembled fellow writers . // Absolutely , we all agreed . But then Elway should get a Purple Heart for the 10 years he spent directing the conservative attack of former Bronco coach Dan Reeves , taking a whupping while all of Denver waited for the last two minutes and the patented Elway Drive to Victory . The brief game-winning drive against the AFC West-leading Chiefs was the first for Elway in the year 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two reasons . One , it showed that Elway could work his come-from-behind magic under easygoing first-year coach Wade Phillips ; and two , it " silenced the critics who said I could n't do this , could n't do that , " said Elway. // Just what " this " and " that " are is unclear , though the answer undoubtedly has something to do with the fact that Elway has gone to the Super Bowl three times without winning , and that even his " touch " passes sometimes leave sinkholes in his receivers ' chests . It is Elway 's desire to be appreciated for being the great tactical quarterback that he is , not just as an " athlete " running around in a dither and hurling last-second , cross-field missiles for improbable and ultimately irrelevant wins . Indeed , the 33-year-old Elway is thriving as never before , in Phillips 's West Coast offense , an attack that allows the quarterback to mix runs and passes in a creative fashion , much as Elway did in the offense he steered at Stanford in 1982 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive coordinator . Elway 's 22 touchdown passes are the most in the AFC this year , and they equal his previous high for a season . But above all he is overjoyed to be free of Reeves 's heavy yoke . " We 're going to open it up from Play One , " he crowed at spring minicamp. // All this is courtesy of Phillips , Denver 's former defensive coordinator and a man with a resemblance to the young Captain Kangaroo . " When I took over , " Phillips says , " I said that Elway was on a par with guys like Dan Marino and Jim Kelly , and they were throwing 25 touchdowns a year while he was throwing 10. " // Sunday 's outing was a good test of Elway 's mettle , for the game was a critical one . A loss would leave the Broncos ' record at 7-6 , three games behind the Chiefs , and would probably knock them out of the playoffs . A win would keep them in line for a wild-card berth . The Chiefs , 9-3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NFL  --  had been looking tough , with a 5-0 mark against AFC West opponents . Moreover , this was the game in which the aging and fragile Joe Montana would be making his debut as a Chief at Mile High . // A major concern in the Kansas City camp was that Montana , who had already missed 25 quarters this season with wrist and leg injuries , would not hold up in the face of the Broncos ' blitzing defense . What 's the difference between Montana and a dollar bill ? went the local gag . A dollar will give you four quarters . When 37-year-old Kansas City kicker Nick Lowery bumped a speedy Seattle Seahawk returner out-of-bounds on Dec. 5 , Montana , also 37 , had jokingly accused Lowery of " overtraining. " // " Yes , " answered Lowery . " But I did n't pull a hamstring . " // Touch ? More troubling , however , was the bundle of oh-fers the Chiefs carried with them to Denver . Not only was Kansas City winless at Mile High Stadium over the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six there if you took his 4 ? years with the Cleveland Browns into account . Furthermore , Montana , the three-time Super Bowl MVP as a San Francisco 49er , was oh for two in Denver . Was there a jinx ? " I do n't believe in jinxes , " said Schottenheimer. // At midweek the Chief locker room at Arrowhead Stadium was festive with Christmas spirit , much of the cheer emanating-from defensive end Neil Smith 's cubicle , which was decorated with wreaths , ornaments , pictures of Santa Claus and blinking , multihued lights , much like a display at your local Walgreens . The sackmeister himself ( Smith 's two sacks of Elway would give him an AFC-leading 13 ) seemed unbowed by the jinx . He hummed along with the Christmas carols wafting from the tape machine under his stacked football shoes . " I 'm celebrating the holidays , " said Smith , " and maybe a division championship . " // But Chief cornerback Dale Carter was apprehensive . " First of all , we hate it , " he said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't breathe up there . " // " I do n't know if it 's perception or reality , " added fellow corner Albert Lewis . " But perception is reality . " Lewis smiled crookedly , then said to himself , " Now , what does he mean by that ? " // Before the game , though , the perception was that this was the year the jinx might be snapped , and the reality , at least through the first quarter , was that the Montana-led Chiefs could n't be stopped . On the game 's opening series Old Joe led his team on an effortless drive that culminated in an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jonathan Hayes . Phillips stood on the sideline , hatless and headset-free , speaking to no one , reverentially watching Montana 's performance like some entertainment-starved trapper fresh out of the Rockies . " I like to see good players play , " he had said before the game . " I 'm a fan . That 's why I liked being the defensive coordinator here , because I could watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on a roll , and it seemed as if there would be no opportunity for Denver drives of any kind . Marcus Allen , the Chiefs ' other ageless off-season acquisition , scored his AFC-leading 14th touchdown on a four-yard run midway through the second quarter , and except for a first-quarter interception by Denver cornerback Ronnie Bradford ( " Not many people in America have intercepted a pass from a legend ! " said the excited young man later ) , Montana appeared infallible . Still , Elway 's nine-yard touchdown pass to Sharpe at the end of the first half made the score 14-10 , Chiefs , and hinted at the possibilities ahead . // In the third quarter the two quarterbacks matched each other thrust for thrust . Elway hit Sharpe on another scoring pass , and Montana countered six minutes later with a 29-yard beauty to wide-out Willie Davis , putting Kansas City back in the lead 21-17 . Then , with just over three minutes gone in the final period , came the blocked punt by Rivers , and suddenly Elway was looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharpe , sculpted like a park statue but agile as a tumbler , promptly beat safety Doug Terry on an out pattern into the right side of the end zone . " I saw man coverage , and I knew John saw it and was coming to me , " said Sharpe , who caught 10 passes for 65 yards and three touchdowns . " I 'm not the fastest man , but I can heal am safety . " // The Broncos made it 27-21 eight minutes later when Jason Elam drilled a 53-yard field goal , a kick that had serious velocity to it . " In practice I 've kicked a 73-yarder , " Elam noted of the blast . " I hit this one that well . " // There was , of course , one last chance for the Chiefs ' delicate genius to work his craft . With 2:26 left to play and no timeouts , Montana took over at his own 20 . But the jinx was as secure as the Broncos ' seven-man secondary , and Montana 's final fourth-down pass fell incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montana , " Phillips said with a shrug in the jubilant Denver locker room . " It would have been hard even for John Elway to do it . " But not impossible . // " I 'd much rather have him in that situation , " Elway said of Montana . " Especially with us up by six . " Then he grinned . " But if it were just a field goal you needed , I 'd rather be in there . You never think anything 's out of reach . " // Certainly not a punt . Journalist Rivers , the punt blocker , continued his discourse on his intertwined careers , saying that it was his viewing of Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford in All the President 's Men when he was a freshman in high school that made him want to become a newspaper guy . " The thing that really hooked me was when they ran out of paper and started writing on napkins , " he said , still moved . " The tenacity about them . I just thought , Yeah , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own role in the continuing saga of John Elway . It 's a good story , and the title 's a no-brainer. // Writer 's Block , of course .
