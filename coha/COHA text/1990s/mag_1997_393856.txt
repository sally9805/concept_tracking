Not long ago I sent my mother a card showing a ' 50s photo of a June Cleaver look-alike rolling out a pie crust . The inside caption read , " I do n't know what she 's doing either . Must be some kind of ancient household ritual . " Which brings me to why I 'm writing about pie-making in the fast-paced ' 90s . Besides the fact that my editor and I both love pies , the truth is that I fear for the ancient household ritual . As soon as the year 2000 , rolling pins could become artifacts . ( Just the other day in an antique store I heard a teenage girl ask her mother the purpose of this artifact . ) At this very moment my teenage son is rolling out a pie crust and muttering words that are n't allowed in this house . All because I do n't want homemade pies to be nothing more than a happy memory because the art died out with his generation of the Vassal-Bokram clan . I do n't think my two sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bye , bye Miss American Pie ) I do n't want future generations to think that pies are born in bakeries . When I was first married , I used to make lots of pies . I pursued my pie-baking hobby after buying a vintage rolling pin at a flea market . I found it relaxing , rolling out the dough and seeing if I could make it resemble a circle . ( I 've often thought I could make millions by inventing a square pie pan . ) Back then I was big on whole grains , natural sweeteners , and tons of butter . For ' 90s pies , I 've had to cut back on fat and time since I 'm not hanging around the stove all day . For those reasons , I rarely make a double-crusted pie . I usually resort to quick-bake , no-bake , or an occasional store-bought pie shell . But I have found that in the food processor age , pie baking can be faster and easier than it was in the good ol ' days . And since homemade pies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you see that fabulous round thing that Phyllis made ? ) So dig out that rolling pin and relax a little . Do n't forget , you 're leaving a legacy . Here are some easy , basic pie crusts . Put all the ingredients in a food processor except the water . Pulse the dough about 4 or 5 times until there are pea-sized butter balls . Drizzle a little water and pulse until it starts to clump together a bit , adding more water if necessary . Do n't over mix ; the dough should have little bits of butter in it . Empty the dough onto a large sheet of wax paper and shape it into a ball . Flatten the ball into a half-inch circle and wrap it in plastic wrap . Freeze for 10 minutes if you 're going to roll it out immediately . Otherwise , the dough can be refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for up to two months . // <p>                  @ @ @
