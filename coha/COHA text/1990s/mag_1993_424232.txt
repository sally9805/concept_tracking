Environmentalists must learn to fight the Wise Use Movement by putting people back into the ecological equation . <p> Ed . Note : In Part I ( Nov. /Dec. 1992 ) of this three-part series , we reported on the history of the Wise Use Movement and the people and corporations behind it . Part II ( Jan. /Feb. 1993 ) described two battles with the Wise Use Movement . In this article , Part III , we present the views of a spectrum of conservationists on ways to respond to Wise Use . <p> " It 's the Economy , Stupid " <p>  --  sign on the wall of Bill Clinton 's campaign headquarters <p> <p> ENVIRONMENTALISTS have allowed themselves to be painted into a corner . They prefer owls over jobs , trees over people , sea turtles over families . So goes the Wise Use message from commodity interests , and the message is finding an audience . Just as the Republican Right successfully partitioned " tax and spend " Democrats from the political mainstream , the Wise Use Movement ( WUM ) is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their threat is not to be underestimated . <p> Jon Roush of Montana 's Canyon Consulting tells of recently appearing on a panel with Charles Cushman of the National Inholders Association and correspondents from CNN and the New York Times . Their audience was the Society of Environmental Journalists , and at the end , Roush says the read on the day by the Times reporter was that " the little guys are out there getting hurt by the big environmentalists . This , " the Times declared , " will be the story of the ' 90s . " <p> It took the Democrats 12 years to reposition themselves and to reshape their message so that it struck a chord with the American public . Environmentalists may be faster learners . There are signs similar to the one that guided Bill Clinton in the minds , if not on the walls , of a growing number of conservation leaders . For many , the sign reads , " It 's the People , Stupid . " <p> Many small environmental groups that operate on the local or regional level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always focused on people and economics . But Darrell Knuffke , Central Rockies regional director of the Wilderness Society , worries that the large national groups let the Wise Use Movement take the high ground . " We failed to communicate that we care about people , " he says . " We did n't speak ... about economics . " <p> Perhaps because they were so focused on the enormity and urgency of ecological problems or on the desperate need for change , many environmentalists lost sight of the human part of the equation . They assumed that when they spoke of saving the Earth , people understood it was being saved for them or for their children . The assumption falls apart when families are worried about the next mortgage payment or the next hospital bill . The Wise Use people recognized and cynically played on very real fears and concerns to create an anti-environmental grassroots movement . <p> Nathaniel Reed , who served as assistant secretary of the Interior in the Nixon and Ford administrations , says the Wise Use Movement has in one sense been positive  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have forced , " he says , " an honest recognition of man 's role on Earth , and the necessity of economic gain in a capitalist society . " As a result , Reed says , the human equation has again become part of environmentalism 's thought and decision-making process . <p> Reed counts himself as one of the many who underestimated the Wise Use Movement . He says ruefully that he misjudged the vast funding the extractive and exploitive industries would pour into it . Most environmental groups were too busy with their parochial battles , be it over mining , grazing , water rights , or timber , to see the threat posed by the coalition of their enemies . Even now , in preparing this article , it was interesting to find that there were many conservation groups that would not discuss the Wise Use Movement on  --  or even off  --  the record . They preferred , they said , to " lay low " on the issue . <p> Some groups , says Paul Pritchard , president of the National Parks and Conservation Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need to get mad . We 've got to come at them directly , " Pritchard argues . " Right now , everybody 's saying , we 're too much above this ; we do n't have to worry about these guys . " ' Much as the Wise Use Movement is a coalition , Pritchard believes its attacks will ultimately bring large and small conservation groups together . " You 'll see more verbal confrontation , " he predicts , " more debate . " <p> Almost everyone agrees the Wise Use Movement must be confronted ; it 's the who and the how that are open to debate . Kelly Cash , of The Nature Conservancy , is a diplomat . " Avoid conflict , " she says . " Negotiate solutions . " The Conservancy relies on outreach and education to counter the fear and hatred spread by the Wise Use Movement . Having worked with 20,000 landowners over 40 years , the Conservancy can draw on a wealth of experience to demonstrate that what is good for nature is also good for business . When Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can make money without overgrazing , they listen . Turnell 's 120,000-acre Pitchfork Ranch includes grazing rights to 40,000 acres in Wyoming 's Shoshone National Forest . Since he started rotating pastures and rebuilding streamsides , Turnell has seen his beef production increase by 300,000 pounds a year . <p> Bridge building has to start in the field , through local grassroots organizing . " We 've dropped the ball , " says Brock Evans of the National Audubon Society . " We need to go into rural communities , not as city boys in suits , but with local people who can talk to their neighbors . " The people already out there say conservationists are in for a pleasant surprise : they and the people of rural America share common values . Jon Roush runs focus groups , each with 20 people of varied backgrounds . When questioned about values , he says , everyone sounds alike . Rhetoric and polarization do n't come until later , when discussion turns to implementation . <p> Darrell Knuffke agrees that there are thousands of people in the West who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the same reasons . And Kelly Cash warns against attacking WUM members ; many , she says , are moderate people who at heart sound just like conservationists . The Nature Conservancy and other groups have noted a surprising number of people who belong to both Wise Use and conservation organizations . <p> But diplomacy does n't always work . Sometimes , Al Runte says , you have to put on a flannel shirt , slug down a beer , and talk direct . The environmental historian ( see his " A Word to the Wise , " May/June 1992 National Parks ) lives in Seattle , where timber companies created the Owls vs . Jobs lie to enlist lumbermen in the industry 's drive to cut the last vestiges of ancient forest . Runte drives a verbal logging truck through an obvious crack : " Listen , guys , " he 'll say . " Wake up and smell the coffee . You guys are suckers . You lost your jobs because the logging industry sent raw logs to Japan and closed their mills . They did n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think they do now ? " <p> The fact is , of course , that loggers and mill workers are being put out of work because they are running out of trees to cut . Paul Pritchard calls lumbermen the blacksmiths of the 20th century . The same economic fact of life confronts the other extractive/exploitive industries . The Western big four  --  mining , ranching , subsidized water , and timber  --  are all in decline . The Kings of the West are in reality the Lords of Yesterday . " The last perception to change , " Darrell Knuffke says , " is how the community makes its living . " In most Western communities , service industries are already the economic mainstay . <p> Those jobs are denigrated by some as being no more than flipping burgers and making motel beds , but in fact , there is vertical integration . The computer/fax/modem revolution is opening the West to new industries and new professionals who are attracted by the same natural values the big four seem bent on destroying . Nevertheless , many rural communities and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than changing economics . Environmental writer Phillip Shabecoff warns that a growing number of Americans " have legitimate fears about how their livelihoods , their property rights , and the quality of their Irves will be affected by environmental laws and regulations . " Those fears , he writes , have to be addressed . <p> Historian Runte finds little new about the crisis facing the workers of the West . When talkies replaced silent films , he says , tens of thousands of musicians were thrown out of work , no longer needed to play background music in local theaters . No one banned talking pictures to save the musicians ' jobs . Likewise , when planes replaced trains , thousands of Pullman workers lost their jobs . No one suggested banning air travel . The porters suffered until they found a new line of work . So it is today with the commodities work force . The situation in the Northwest is not , as the Wise Use Movement would have it , about jobs . It is about temporary employment while the timber companies squeeze the last drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hammer home the point that traditional Western jobs are disappearing because of economic change , not environmental fiat . They need to explore and accentuate shared values . They need to organize on the local level . And then they need to extend a hand . Like most conservationists , NPCA 's Pritchard strongly believes it 's possible to balance jobs and the environment . Activists have consistently argued that an environmental agenda will create more jobs than it costs . The time has come to put that belief into action . Rural workers are also a resource ; we must not , in our race to save one resource , destroy another . There 's a built-in bonus to the logic of preserving human as well as natural resources : each worker for whom conservationists find meaningful new employment means one fewer foot soldier to be exploited and manipulated by the Wise Use Movement . <p> And there 's work to be done . From rebuilding stream banks to replanting entire forests , there are tasks which not only give displaced workers paychecks , but which have an economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of parallel-strand lumber techniques , which apply the concept behind plywood to the fabrication of giant load-bearing beams , means that smaller second-growth wood can do the job of taller old-growth trees . Millions of acres of second-growth forest are being profitably harvested in the East and South . Conversely , there are millions of acres of devastated forestland in the West . The same skills that made the mess can clean it up . These are jobs that require little or no retraining . A side benefit is that growing hundreds of millions of new trees will remove and store vast quantities of atmospheric carbon . <p> Resource restoration may be the ultimate infrastructure repair . Audubon 's Brock Evans has identified 137 watersheds that need restoration . There is work there to last 20 years , he says , and when it 's done , we wo n't have just a highway that 's good for maybe 15 years ; we 'll have a sustainable forest good for a millennium . Renewed forests and renewed watersheds will mean a renewed timber industry and renewed fisheries . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ban the export of raw logs . Exporting ancient forests to Japan is putting Americans out of work at the same time it is destroying our natural heritage . <p> Pragmatism also means moderation . The West can not and should not be turned into one vast nature preserve . Efforts like the one to end all grazing rights , with its " Cattle Free by ' 93 " slogan , are not only unrealistic , but serve to put every rancher on the defensive . As The Nature Conservancy has amply demonstrated , sustainable grazing is not only possible , it is beneficial to the environment . Native grasses thrive best with limited grazing ; today 's cattle fill the role once played by the buffalo . Instead of turning ranchers into enemies , conservationists need to build on the shared love of the land and work with the cattlemen to achieve a true wise use  --  sustainable ranching . <p> Working together produces unexpected benefits . Environmentalists and California rice farmers fought for years over the farmers ' practice of burning off their fields after the harvest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The water breaks down the chaff for the farmers and at the same time creates much-needed wetlands for migratory birds during the key winter period . There 's even a bonus for the birds : farmers leave behind some 300 pounds of rice per acre during harvest . <p> If " The Story of the ' 90s " is to be written with a happy ending for nature and the environment , then conservationists need a strong dose of political savvy . It 's commonly acknowledged that the Wise Use Movement has borrowed heavily from environmentalism 's grassroots textbook . What may not be so apparent is that the WUM has shuffled those pages into the Far Right 's political textbook of lies and dirty tricks , misrepresentation , and oversimplification . Kathryn Hohmann , who handles public lands issues for the Sierra Club , warns that " perception drives politics . " When the New York Times buys into the argument that " little guys " are being hurt by " big environment , " danger flags should go up all over . When the Times decides that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to head for the bunkers . <p> Brock Evans counts votes on Capitol Hill for Audubon . He notes that Western Republican members of Congress have voted lock-step against conservation measures for years , and he sees no evidence of Wise Use political gains . " I 'll worry , " he says , " if they start getting the moderate vote . " Despite massive WUM lobbying for two successive provisions to open the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve to oil exploration , conservationists have successfully blocked the bills . <p> But moderates read the New York Times and , reminds Nathaniel Reed , " All politics is local . " The commodities interests understand that . While large conservation and environmental organizations have become increasingly Beltway-bound , the big extractors and exploiters have been pumping massive corporate dollars into grassroots rabble rousing . Evans recognizes that the large WUM war chest and sophisticated political tools spell a serious threat . " They can really rile up the locals , " he says , " and all our initiatives are in their territory . They can slow us down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental agenda , or stops or even reverses it , will be determined in large part by how quickly and how well conservationists react politically . There was significant commingling of key environmental people in the Clinton campaign and transition . One can only hope those people were as busy ascertaining as they were advocating . <p> One hopeful sign is that conservation groups are turning to political consultants for advice . One who talked with me off the record said the environmental movement has become the political incumbent , perceived as large , well-endowed , powerful , institutionalized , out of touch  --  even though the Wise Use Movement is larger and is heavily bankrolled by industry . The time is ripe , he warns , for a change-oriented " take back the land " anti-incumbent movement  --  a quasi-populist attack on conservationism . <p> Environmentalists must heed the first rule of politics : learn what people care most about , then answer their needs . Consultants point to Clinton 's " Timber Summit " as an object lesson : sit down , talk about the problem , listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a key tactical weapon against the Elmer Gantrys of WUM , but it 's not the way to deal with the larger issue of public opinion . <p> Jon Roush advocates that public policy must deliver clear and immediate benefits if it is to win public support . Part of the solution is to redefine the argument . If the debate is over owls vs. jobs , the owls will ultimately lose . If the debate is over short-term greed vs. long term jobs , the scales of public opinion will shift . Kathryn Hohmann notes the success environmentalists had in passing the Clean Air Act , once they persuaded the unions that benefits outweighed the cost . <p> People do believe in multiple use , but not at the expense of clean air or clean water or their cherished national parks . And people do expect industry to pay its fair share . Conservationists need to tap these shared roots to build coalitions with workers and business . They must now demonstrate that the environmental agenda can make the economy grow even as it makes the community a better place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter with positive alternatives . It is time to move the masses . <p> CARTOONS <p> By Richard M. Stapleton <p> <p> Richard Stapleton wrote and produced " Down to Earth , " a daily environmental broadcast , for CBS Radio News .
