<p> AS PART OF OUR CELEBRATION of ROLLING STONE 's twenty-fifth anniversary , we asked our readers to tell us about their own experiences over the past two and a half decades . The response was overwhelming - nearly a thousand letters came in . The readers ' ages ranged from thirteen to seventy-two , and under occupation ' they wrote everything from administrative law justice ' to self-unemployed . ' <p> Each letter is unique , but some themes appear again and again : People write of the loss of heroes who died too young , of wrong turns and recovery , of disillusionment and hope . They remember the excitement of first hearing a new artist - the Beatles , Bob Dylan , the Rolling Stones , Kiss , Queen , Donna Summer , Van Halen , Jane 's Addiction - and the pleasure of finding a connection with strangers , friends , a sibling , a parent or a child through music . The older and the younger readers talk about missing ( in both senses of the term ) the Sixties ; in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punk or who are in a state of denial about Saturday Night Fever and platform shoes . <p> The hard part was presenting the response in a way that gives a sense of the whole . The following letters are anything but typical , but each somehow speaks for many of us . Thanks to those of you who wished us well on our anniversary , and thanks to everyone who contributed . <p> SAN FRANCISCO , SAIGON , NAIROBI <p> I WAS TWENTY-TWO in ' 66 as I left a huge blizzard behind and drove west to start my first job . The storm had dumped a snow that was measured in feet instead of inches . Steve , who lived nearby , got horny and set off on foot to visit a lady friend . I had the same urge and , as the roads were impassable , walked the three miles to Jeanne 's house . I got lucky , and Steve got lost . Three days later I was in California . They found Steve in the spring , when the snow melted . I never could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airplanes were always a fascination . My dad wanted to be a pilot , but his mother talked it down . Too dangerous , ' she said . Then his father died , and he was obliged to assume the family business . Just before the war , now married , he secretly took flying lessons . An honorable man , he planned to tell his wife of his doings as soon as he soloed . The day finally came , but before he could tell her the news , she had news for him . She was pregnant . With me . He reluctantly gave up flying but not the dream . My earliest memories are sitting with him in the cockpit of a friend 's Piper Cub , headsets pressed to our ears , watching and listening to the planes taking off and landing . <p> That first job was flying across the Pacific Ocean to Vietnam . Air Force ROTC and flight training was one way to get into the cockpit of a big commercial jet and avoid the draft at the same time . I never fancied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there just before ROLLING STONE . <p> Travis Air Force Base , near Vacaville , was a busy place . Several major airlines had lucrative contracts to fly the troops off to war . We did the cargo . Class A explosives , reconditioned helicopters and other implements of destruction . The pay was good , and the travel was exciting , and we had time to play . A cabin at Squaw Valley . A ski boat at Lake Berryessa and a motorcycle to get to it . There were more stewardesses living in Vacaplace ' than was healthy for any red-blooded post-adolescent . The parties were awesome . <p> San Francisco was in its salad days . Barbara was a six-foot copywriter , and we met skiing . She had a nice circle of friends . Jim Marshall , the photographer who documented the era , took us to concerts . Moby Grape at the Avalon . Janis at the Matrix . Gibby Folger was his lady , just before she met Sharon Tate and Charles Manson . We celebrated her last birthday at a small Mexican restaurant on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with music by the Jefferson Airplane and the Dead . Barbara must have given me a copy of ROLLING STONE . All the news , and it did seem to fit . Big Daddy ' Tom Donahue led another band of pranksters from KMPX to KSAN , and rebel FM rock was born . I taped the entire first day , from the I Ching to Tony Pigg . We were in the crowd for the April 15th March to End the War . Country Joe was there on the back of a flatbed truck , singing about the boys I was flying home in a box . Later , Barbara and I went to the beach , shared my first joint and watched the sunset . We had dinner at the officers ' club . It was an eclectic sort of day . <p> We were joined by the squadron commander . He assured us that the war was important and correct . The colonel was a rare kind of officer . He was kind and gentle . Interested and interesting . Concerned and intelligent . His next assignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that , contrary to his predeparture briefing , there was a serious heroin problem in Vietnam . When he brought it to the attention of his superiors , the problem was dismissed . I 'm leaving in three months , and there will not be a problem while I am here ' was the attitude . The only alternative was to get close to his men . He invited them for a swim in the pool at his villa . A few beers and a bit of food . Eventually he may have even shared a bit of spliff with them . He gained their confidence and their trust and would have a confirmed smackhead out on the next flight . It was n't much , in the face of the immensity of the problem , but it was a start . Understandably , morale in the squadron went up . This did not go unnoticed or unquestioned by the generals . A lieutenant was planted , the plot ' was uncovered , and the colonel was court-martialed . He went to Leavenworth for eighteen months and , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed his mind about the war . <p> The conflict dragged on , and I resigned my commission . At the time there was an airline recession and a surplus of pilots . I was offered a job in Kenya and soon found myself in a magic land with spectacular mountains , high plateaus , wild scrub plains and miles of empty beaches , where the sand squeaks under every step . Blessed with fertile land , ample rain , marvelous people and mind-boggling wildlife , Kenya is a startling contradiction to the nearby strife and famine . East African Airways was a legend , formed after World War II by remarkable aviation pioneers , adventurers and rogues . I did the international routes and picked up my ROLLING STONE in London . The pages were soon worn thin by an odd assortment of friends , travelers and the curious . I often said it would be the periodical of choice if I were ever stranded on a deserted island . I bought a shamba at the foot of the Ngong Hills , built a house and settled in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was on the street . And the highway . The MK II Jaguar came from London , and I drove it to California . Along the way I met another airline , and soon I was based at JFK , flying all over the world , living out of a suitcase and longing to return to Africa . A houseboat on the Hudson River at Seventy-ninth Street on the West Side of Manhattan was the solution to the housing problem . A water bed with a view , fresh air and a postbox , stuffed every two weeks with ROLLING STONE . It was only a brisk five minutes on the bike to Zabar 's . I heard the ambulance take John Lennon to Roosevelt Hospital , and then Vin Scelsa was on the radio giving us a forum to talk it out . Tony Pigg had moved east and was also on New York radio . He was like an old friend . I dubbed him a copy of his first KSAN show but never heard if he received it . <p> In 1986 , the airline collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in a thirty-year-old Bentley . Eight thousand miles from the Hudson to Los Angeles . Not the most direct route , but it cleared the head . <p> One way or another , it was important to be back in Kenya . So now I fly smaller airplanes . The bruised ego has healed , although my bank manager is still a bit nervous . I guess I should take him on an airborne early-morning game drive . I wonder if he has ever looked up at a giraffe at 200 miles per hour . It is a neat little airline , and I am home every night . ROLLING STONE gets to me still , via the Boat Basin , three or four issues at a time . It is always a dilemma which issue to read first . The pages still get worn thin , and I sometimes wonder if I have found that deserted island . <p> Dad went back to flying and now has nearly 1000 hours in his logbook . I just learned that Jeanne committed suicide - something to do with Prozac . Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years ago . I 'm still not married . Do n't ask me why . There 's still so much that I do n't understand . A couple of ROLLING STONEs arrived in the post today . Maybe some of the answers are in there . The next twenty-five years promise even more change , at a greater velocity . We 're all Riders on the Storm . ' Thanks for the saddle . <p> DOUGLAS G.

He played in a band , and we hung out , fluctuating between Troy and Albany . It was at that time I started to develop my own ideas . At home my parents attempted to censor both my friends and those ideas . It all came out in ugly bouts of shouting and anger . I 'll never forget the time my older brother came home on spring break and invited me for a toke of hash in the back yard . All our sibling squabbles vanished in that moment . He did n't even mind I dropped the one and only piece of hash in our gravel driveway and could n't find it . He was just glad to know he had a new comrade against the system in his baby sister . It was in that spring that he dropped out of art school , causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snuck out of town with my son 's father . <p> Blue was born in late June 1969 . We moved to Maine , where we spent the first year of Blue 's life . I loved the green pine freshness and the simpleness in everybody 's homes and ways . We had no electricity and rarely got to town . We did n't know about Kent State until some people hitchhiking through in midsummer told us . Blue 's father went to find work on the Cape , and we did n't make it much past that . He took off to California with another woman , and I headed to Arizona with some friends . <p> In Arizona , I got caught up in with the marijuana trade . I liked the desert a lot and had a friend who let Blue and me take his stagecoach out to play on . The trade was laissez faire , but poco a poco it began to get violent . A friend of mine died in my arms , a bullet in the head . I packed everything up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I raised my son and went to college . <p> I never heard from Blue 's father again , but Blue says it does n't matter anymore anyway .

My high-school sweetheart continues to be my longest-running friend ( twenty-seven years ) . He lives in San Diego , and once in a while we get together and share jokes . He was in Vietnam during the Tet offensive . His memories are clear and tragic . When I think of him , I think of the Rolling Stones ' December 's Children because that was when we were last alive and whole . My mom died in 1979 , and when I think of her , I think of Jim Croce 's Time in a Bottle ' because the woman really was someone you 'd want to go through time with .

My dad is in Vietnam ; my mom is a basket case of fear ; and I am enjoying - and struggling with - the first full bloom of adolescent hormones in my ninth-grade body . I wear the grooves thin on an album by the Beatles that sounds like nothing I have ever heard before . I particularly like the lyric She 's leaving home , bye , bye ' - maybe because my mother is shocked to see the word bitchin ' ' used as an adjective in my yearbook to describe me and threatens never to let me hang out with those kinds of friends again . My dad arrives home in August , extremely thin and completely closemouthed about everything that happened over there .

Only being interested in King Crimson , the Moody Blues and the Bee Gees , I was separated from the mainstream . There were no girlfriends , and recreation meant drugs . <p> Barbiturates were prescribed for my neck aches , caused by head twitches I 'd had since eight . Instead of breakfast , I popped six pills and spouted off in English class simian similarities between Erich Von Daniken 's aliens and the Holy Mary 's Immaculate Conception . <p> My mother filled out my application to Utah State University while I smoked joints . Utah was the place ' to study , where Mormons are healthy , moral and civic minded . We were Catholics . Mormons are not like Catholics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I spent twenty days in jail . Landscape architecture accidentally became a real career possibility . <p> Mormon theology states homosexuality is second in sin only to murder . Freshman year I officially came out ' to my classmates . Everyone thought it was a joke because nobody would dare declare himself gay in Utah . Ironically , I was safe . <p> The day after receiving my degree , I skimmed across the Nevada desert in my VW bug toward San Francisco 's gay refugee camp . Disco was the sound , and delightfully the Bee Gees got short-lived respect . Nobody knew at the time that AIDS was spreading amongst the Bay Area sexual athletes . The puppet president kept falling asleep while the world faced an unnamed deadly disease . <p> Landscape architecture suffered in the new ' economy , and my lengthiest job was three years . Friends died . Weekly wakes , masses and ash spreading became banal . <p> One day I asked my therapist of seven years whether I should kill myself .

I was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) and a tic disorder . <p> In 1986 , I got out of San Francisco . Key West was my destination . In one day I had jumped from the frying pan into the microwave . One humid day , ROLLING STONE had an article that spoke of OCD . Through the article , I found a doctor in Boston who specialized in the disorder . Within a week , I moved to Boston and scheduled an appointment with Dr. Michael Jenike . Within thirty minutes , he said , It sounds like you have OCD and Tourette 's syndrome . ' It was a horrific yet comforting final diagnosis . Three years later , I survived two cingulotomies ( brain surgery ) to mediate the OCD , which intertwines with TS . The annual Boston AIDS walk could be seen from my hospital bed . <p> I 'm a San Francisco resident again . My attitude is brighter .

' The Summer of Love was upon us , and we basked in our waning but carefree childhood , excited about music , girls , starting our own rock bands and entering high school . <p> For reasons that are still somewhat mysterious to me , I opted to go to Queen of Angels Seminary , in the San Fernando Valley , a minor seminary ' for boys who thought they might have a calling to be Roman Catholic priests . I left the world , my family , my friends for a thirteen-year quasi-monastic odyssey to the priesthood . <p> Seminary life was strict : short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no girls allowed . But the music kept us in touch with the world . I have fond memories of shooting pool in the rec hall and playing air guitar with my cue stick to the licks of In-a-gadda-da-vida , ' while a buddy of mine did that oh-so-famous drum solo on a nearby plastic folding chair . One of the priests even based a whole Sunday sermon on All You Need Is Love . ' Then there was the time when we were rolling on the floor in laughter after someone played the Doors ' new Soft Parade album on the rec-hall stereo and Jim Morrison launched into his When I was back there in seminary school ' tirade . Needless to say , the record was banned from the seminary . <p> I also remember being told by a priest that it was inappropriate to pray for the soul of the just-deceased Jimi Hendrix . And I 'll never forget Holy Thursday evening during senior year , when a pious priest led us virgin high-school boys in the Prayer of Commitment to Celibacy . I was sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the middle of the prayer , he flipped off the priest . In chapel ! On Holy Thursday ! My naive younger self was shocked , but the image stayed with me all my life . Damn it , Paul was right ! <p> I find that I am now professionally flipping off the church , perhaps not as graphically as my friend Paul did , but just as sincerely . I lived eleven of those years as an ordained Catholic priest , the best and worst years of my life , but I decided to call it quits on December 27th , 1991 . ROLLING STONE 621 was on sale that week , and it contained my parting shot to the church , a letter in support of Larry Wright 's excellent profile of Father Matthew Fox in RS 617 . My letter stated , Your revealing article on Matthew Fox gives Christians hope that there is indeed more to religion than Original Sin , negative commandments and the need to be saved ' from something we had nothing to do with . ' <p> I left the priesthood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no concrete job plans pportunities other than to try to make it as a rock musician . I eventually became bass player for an Oakland band called Serious Children . But Matt Fox noticed my RS letter and tracked me down somehow , and now I work for him as an administrative and media assistant . I am able to channel my anger and experience in the church into the Creation Spirituality movement , working with Matt to help build a more compassionate church in an interconnected world . <p> So I 've come to a complete circle , staying up late with my thirtysomething friends , chomping pizzas and talking excitedly about music , our bands , our relationships . Thank you , ROLLING STONE , for being an important part of my coming of age . <p> KEN CANEDO , 38 Oakland , California <p> <p> PHOTO : THIS IS YOUR BRAIN <p> PHOTO : THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON GOD <p> PHOTO : THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON ROCK &; ROLL <p> FIGHTING THE SAME BATTLES <p> HOW LONG DID THE SIXTIES actually last ?

It was Rusty 's uncle 's back yard , and I was not to tell anyone about those funny-smelling bushes that he rolled into little , funny cigarettes with Barbie-size paper towels called Zig Zag . Rusty was my boyfriend . ' We would take baths together and fart in the tub . It did n't seem to matter that his family was white and mine black . <p> As an African American woman whose mom marched on Washington with Martin Luther King , I ca n't say the Sixties did n't affect me , even though I was born in 1970 . My grandmother and my mother made me feel it was my duty , my destiny almost , to carry on the Sixties fight by taking advantage of the opportunities the women 's movement and the civil-rights movement opened up for me . <p> When I look back on those memories of Rusty and me , we certainly do seem like an anomaly from the Sixties . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but whites and nonwhites of America seem more polarized now than before . I attended that old bastion of the Sixties , the University of California at Berkeley . My freshman year ( 1988-89 ) , I pledged but was not initiated to a sorority where I would have been the only African American member . Of the seventeen sororities at UC Berkeley , two had an African American member . Twice during my sophomore year I joined the student strike against the UC system , which was n't moving fast enough to diversify the faculty or the student population . <p> The winter of my junior year , I had the worst bronchitis imaginable . A smoke-in was announced to protest against a proposal put forth by Bush 's then drug czar , Bennett , that would require students receiving financial aid to sign a type of loyalty oath saying they would not use the money for drugs . Free joints were thrown into the crowd of thousands on Upper Sproul . The pot must have been good : When I took my first puff ever , I choked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth onto the leg of an unsuspecting protester sitting next to me . The whole protest was videotaped by UCPD . If ever I want to run for public office , it wo n't be the pot smoking the press will use to crucify me ; it will be the fact that I did n't ' fess up to lugeying on that dude 's leg . <p> There was n't any pot at the gulf-war protests , but that is n't why I chose not to attend . I was at home writing letters to every politician I could think of , but I did n't think they would help . I felt like these old white men were just gon na look for reasons , make them up if they had to , to continue pouring money into a military-industrial complex rather than into society 's domestic wounds . <p> My senior year , I made two monumental trips across the Bay Bridge . One was to get to the San Francisco Abortion Rights Rally . The whole idea that the Supreme Court could be reassessing Roe v. Wade after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just me . The other was to protest the Rodney King verdict . <p> So these were my Eighties and Seventies . What did they mean to me ? They were inspiring and frightening . It 's inspiring to see the generation society wrote off as apathetic . My generation is active and aware and willing to struggle for whatever they feel is right . What is frightening is why many of us are fighting . My legacy was to forward my mother 's work , not to be my mother , fighting for all the things she was fighting for . Luckily , I 'm not the only one who is doing the work , and together I know we can make the Nineties a decade to remember . <p> ADREANA PATRICIA LANGSTON , 22 Long Beach , California <p> <p> PHOTO : PROTESTING THE RODNEY KING VERDICT <p> LONG LIVE ROCK ! <p> I WAS BORN in 1967 , so I 'm the same age with ROLLING STONE . 1967 was the second year of the Culture Revolution , the sounds I heard were those kind of things : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared , red songs .

And ROLLING STONE ! <p> LI XU , 25 Shanghai , China <p> <p> PHOTO : FROM RED SONGS TO ROCK ' N ' ROLL <p> THE ETERNAL OATH OF DEBAUCHERY <p> IN TWENTY-THREE YEARS of living on this amazing planet , I 've witnessed and partaken in some truly unbelievable events . I seem to have sworn the eternal oath of debauchery and have willed my life to squalor - a means of existence that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodstock and most of the Sixties , but I 've done my best to make up for it . Perhaps one of my collaborators summed it up best when I woke up on the floor one morning and asked him what had happened . He said , Dude , we partied like rock stars . ' <p> Indeed , the previous night I 'd seen my friend Hugh try to ride a surfboard down the side of the USC Fiji house and land it on a couch on the balcony . Applause came from below , where teenage girls were trampling one another to get to the kegs . In the end , Hugh 's broken leg was nothing compared with the references made to the size of his genitals and their ability to eclipse the sun . I got laid just for being there . <p> Another night at the Fiji house , they were throwing burning hay bales into the street from the roof . Someone called the fire department , and the LAPD showed up to take names . Soon afterward there was a massive bonfire fueled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When all of the furniture had been used up , someone tossed a fish tank off the balcony , followed in short order by a Coke machine . It was quite the tour de force , and the rooftops abounded with spectators awaiting an encore when the paddy wagons showed up . <p> I went over to help straighten things out and wound up in L.A. County , where I had time to reflect on matters . I thought of Thoreau writing his essay on civil disobedience , and I wondered what had happened to the spirit of men like Gandhi and King . Although my version is far from passive resistance , it is definitely a form of civil disobedience . The beauty of it is that it is blind to color and religion , wealth and politics . <p> SETH CASH SCHADER , 23 Seattle , Washington <p> <p> PHOTO : THE AUTHOR ON AN OFF DAY <p> THE PROMISE OF PEOPLE POWER <p> DURING MY FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE , in the fall of 1990 , I became involved in anti-gulf-war activities . I was terrified of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could die and those unenlisted could be drafted ; I was also strangely excited . There was the promise of people power , ' of unity in a struggle against the Powers That Be , a chance for Real Change - a shot at tasting what the glorious 1960s were all about . <p> But what I did n't realize until the war went marching briskly past us - ignoring the protests that I attended to the complete exclusion of my classes - was that we , the dissenters , had not learned from history , and the government had . They anticipated our tactics and expertly twisted public opinion through the skillful use of the media , mortally wounding the movement ( if it ever deserved to be called that ) before we had a chance to get any momentum . <p> And faced with this , what did the few Vietnam-era protesters who joined us in the bitter midwinter cold do ? They assumed control over rallies because they had been there before and knew an abundance of dusty old songs and slogans . They told me that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed me in the technique of passive nonviolence and implored me to join them in lighting candles and silent meditation . They scolded me for not wearing a plastic yellow ribbon and refusing to carry a sign that said , I SUPPORT THE TROOPS . They were disgusted when we stenciled CENSORED BY THE U.S. MILITARY on newspaper vending machines . <p> But did the peaceful sing-alongs , purged of any individuals with a hint of anger or aggression , accomplish a damn thing ? The government and the military were not threatened at all , merely annoyed - like I am by mosquitoes . Mosquitoes do not send me running for the hills . I simply wait until I can whack the blood out of them and finish whatever I was doing before the pesky interruption . <p> My generation does not want to be patronized - not by the government and not by a generation that , long ago , had ideals and energy but today engages in little more than relating warm and fuzzy tales of when I was your age ' while pondering the laziness and apathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : You did not grow up in the 1980s , as we did ; you just got rich in the 1980s . Perhaps a more constructive relationship between our two generations could be formed if you attempted to understand what that means and put to rest the celebrations of an admittedly magical but unfortunately dead time period . <p> KRISTINA LARSEN , 19 Franklin , Vermont <p> <p> PHOTO : TEEN TO SIXTIES PEOPLE : DROP DEAD ! <p> WAKING UP TO SOMETHING WONDERFUL <p> I REMEMBER LYING ON the table , my fearful words filling the heavy silence : What are the effects ? ' I already knew the answer I was afraid to hear . <p> You 'll probably be treated with chemotherapy and . . . You know , kids never seem to be concerned with the vomiting or other parts of chemotherapy - just losing their hair . ' The doctor tried to gently brush away my tears with her hand . Her eyes spoke : I 'm sorry , I 'm so sorry . The room was dark . Traces of radiation on my hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer screen . I was sixteen . It was my birthday . <p> Since I 've lived for only nineteen years , Hodgkin 's disease has been my greatest challenge , but the first coherent thought to enter my head after that overwhelming shock will long be my greatest triumph : Well , Sinead O'Connor has no hair , and she 's really cool . After a year of constant pain and inconclusive tests , I had set a course for victory - without even knowing . <p> My left brain rationalized : At least now we know what 's been wrong with you . There 's no use in getting upset . Just concentrate on fighting it . ' My ever-creative right brain kicked in with : Let 's get a mohawk ! It 's going to fall out anyway . Why not ? ' The opportunity to see R.E.M . at the Boston Garden prompted me to convince my mother that I needed to get a mohawk . ( If you do n't let me get one , I 'm going to the concert bald ! . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ) The mohawk pretty much fell out after a week ; my father trimmed what little was left down to a fine peach fuzz . <p> Musical influence during this crisis was tremendous . Drawing strength from Sinead O'Connor 's individuality and intense beauty , I was able to enjoy the experience and revel in a nonconformist bliss . The fuck-what-they-think attitude was blended with a self-respecting sense of It 's the end of the world , and I feel fine . ' I think that outlook made everyone feel a little more comfortable . <p> My fight against cancer put me to the test ; I was pushed to the limit and forced to make the best of it . Currently in remission , I see a long life ahead , a road that will continue to be marked by songs and the people who create them . Music empowered me with hope , strength and vitality . Baldness brought out in me a confidence I did n't know I had . Having survived , I 'm left with the unconquerable feeling that there 's nothing I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locks now fall well past my shoulders and will continue to do so for a while . <p> I 've been delving into the music scene in Boston : hitting the clubs and sporting mosh marks from seeing our home-grown favorite , Tribe . The new world of local music is opening up to me . I feel like I 'm waking up to something wonderful , something that 's always been out there on the edge , somewhere just out of reach . Now the air crackles with an energy and excitement I can breathe . I 'm alive . . . . Oh , yeah , I 'm alive . <p> JENNIFER S.
