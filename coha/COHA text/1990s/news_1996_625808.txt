<p> BEVERLY HILLS - Do n't look for Jennifer Jason Leigh in her film roles . She 's not there . <p> The prospect is frightening , since Leigh has made a career - a highly praised one - of playing some of the most burned-out , wasted , morally confused and heavily drugged characters in recent memory . <p> Her latest , a desperately eager-to-please wannabe singer named Sadie in " " Georgia , " now playing at the River Oaks 3 , is one more grim stop on a resumethat includes numerous drug addicts " " ( Rush , Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle ) , " hookers " " ( Last Exit to Brooklyn , Miami Blues ) " and women on the brink of madness " " ( Single White Female ) . " Even playing a housewife in " " Short Cuts , " she sold phone sex . <p> It 's quite a list for an actress who quietly says her life is " " pretty simple . " <p> " " I 'm a real homebody . I play with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies all the time . I go out to dinner and read . " Sadie , for which she was voted best actress of 1995 by the New York Film Critics Association , is a classic lost soul . It would set new standards of desperation and low-living for most actresses , although it 's about par for Leigh . <p> " " Those are the parts I 'm attracted to , " she says . " " It 's not a cerebral process . When I read a script , either I have a gut reaction that I want to play the woman , or I do n't . The women I 'm inspired by are complicated . " <p> She insists she 's not repeating herself . <p> " " The characters I chose are very different , I think . They may all have a very hard life , but the way they live it is very different . I change as much as I can . I want to be able to look in the mirror and see the character and not see myself . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , screenwriter Barbara Turner , from an idea by Leigh . Sadie is the younger sister of a star folksinger , Georgia , played by Leigh 's childhood friend , Mare Winningham . <p> Georgia is happily married with children and a home . She has " " a voice from God , " Leigh says , and she would be content even if not performing . <p> Passion to perform <p> Sadie has nothing but a great passion to sing and perform . But she really ca n't . She struggles along at the bottom of the Seattle music scene , lead singer for no-name groups going nowhere in crummy bars . She does coke , sleeps around and occasionally turns up at her sister 's farm . <p> She both worships and sponges off Georgia . She 's a pest , but a much-loved one . She 's depressing to care about , but she 's almost always upbeat . <p> " " Sadie is great , " Leigh says . " " She 's so generous . I mean , she steals from everybody , but she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just such a fighter . She 's got so much hope , and she 's so desperate to please . <p> " " She has this uncontrollable yearning , and her need is just boundary-less . She 's wildly in love with what she does . She 's so free up there ( on stage ) , so naked and so raw . That 's her gift , something Georgia does n't have . But Sadie does n't have a voice . " <p> Leigh is so convincing and natural in the role that , though you know it 's just a performance , it 's a surprise to see her looking reasonably sound and healthy the day after a screening . <p> Dressed head to toe in black , except for an oversize orange and blue jacket , she looks very girlish , with short , straight blond hair . Her little-girl voice , and an occasional bounciness when something amuses her , adds to the impression she 's half her almost 34 years . <p> " " I 'm closer to Georgia emotionally than I am to Sadie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do require a lot of quiet . " <p> There have been a few upbeat roles in Leigh 's 25 films . In " " The Hudsucker Proxy , " she did a delicious parody of a Rosalind Russell-style fast-talking reporter . In her first major film , " " Fast Times at Ridgemont High , " she was the sweet sister discovering boys . <p> But overall , Leigh 's role choices could be a book : how not to build a successful star career in Hollywood . What drives her to the roles she picks , when many young actresses are trying to find cute or sexy roles that endear them to the public ? <p> Playing someone else <p> " " Acting is the only place I feel un-self-conscious , " she says . <p> " " Very safe , very whole . Because I 'm playing someone else . <p> " " I think it sort of helps my life because I can experience ( these things ) in a really healthy way . For me , it is a way of communicating something I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of critics ' and festival awards , most of her roles are too uncomfortable for Academy Award voters to nominate . This year could change that if enough Academy members see the late-opening " " Georgia . " But they may find this performance too painful to like . <p> It 's also too harsh to be a big box office success , though it should find a small , appreciative audience . <p> " " This is obviously a film that is very meaningful to me . It 's like a tiny , tiny small miracle that we got it made . ( It 's not often ) you get to do a movie you would really like to go see . " <p> The most remarkable scene in " " Georgia " - already becoming infamous - is one in which Sadie/Leigh sings a single song , " " Take Me Back " by Van Morrison , live before an audience for 8 1/2 minutes , a staggeringly long time on film . <p> Instead of hiring extras , the independent movie set up a real concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular local bands . <p> In the story , it is Georgia 's concert , and she makes a gesture to her less-talented sister by asking her to sing a song . It 's typical of Sadie that she picks a very long , inappropriate ballad , and then sings it in the most raw , painful way possible . <p> Leigh , who really loves singing , had listened to and practiced the song endlessly in advance , but was still terrifically frightened by having to perform it live , with few chances to do it right . <p> " " That night was crazy ; 3,000 people were there " she says . " " It was terrifying . " Her singing in the film is more emotion than skill , more power than beauty . <p> " " I do have Sadie 's voice , " she says . " " I was n't trying to sound <p> bad ; I was trying to sound good . I love to sing . " <p> Somehow , everyone got through the concert in just two takes , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " " There was so much adrenaline pumping that it took a couple of days to recover , " Leigh says . <p> Leigh loved the opportunity to work with Winningham , who had been a childhood inspiration as a leader at a youth camp they attended . <p> " " Mare was the best actress in the camp , " Leigh says . " " She was 17 ; I was 14 . She was like this golden girl . She would sing me songs she had written , and I still remember the words to the songs . <p> " " She has this incredible grace . She was always Georgia for me . " <p> Leigh , whose real name is Jennifer Leigh Morrow , is the daughter of Turner and actor Vic Morrow , who was killed on the set of " " Twilight Zone : The Movie " when Leigh was 20 . <p> Her parents separated when Leigh was very young , and she and her father hardly knew each other . <p> But Leigh is very close to her mom - " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - and she was excited to work with her . " " I trusted her implicitly . She 's an amazing woman , really brilliant , and ( her script ) all comes from a place of truth . " Usually she did n't feel inhibited with her mom on set . But there was one scene she would n't let her watch . <p> " " That was the love scene . I could n't , " Leigh says with a giggle . <p> " " Love scenes are not hard to do because they are on a closed set . Love scenes are a way to express something about the character that you do n't see in any other scene . <p> " " But this was with my mother there , and that was just a line I could n't cross .
