<p> For the past 29 years , I have been a fortunate man , teaching history to hundreds of graduate students and thousands of undergraduates at the University of Georgia . During this whole time I have had an office in LeConte Hall , from which over the past several years I have lost four colleagues to cancer . <p> We are preparing to move to Joe Brown Hall so that work crews may refurbish LeConte . I am grateful to the administration for this gesture : We should have freshly painted offices , reconfigured classrooms , a brand- new heating and air-conditioning system . <p> But mine is a tempered gratitude : If LeConte is a sick building , then they are gilding poison ivy or whitewashing our pesthole . <p> Many of my colleagues share my deep reservations about the building . One economics professor keeps his LeConte classroom windows open as a protest over what he feels is the danger of the building . <p> After all , it is not just a matter of aging historians , but of thousands of students who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Berrigan is a history professor at the University of Georgia . Modern-day shame MONA BENNETT , Doraville <p> Why is it that Newt wants to return to Victorian values ? Could it be that it was a time when affluent , straight , white , Protestant males ruled ? The good old days were n't so good . The white male never took his foot off the necks of women and other minorities . There was less crime , but there were fewer rights . Many crimes that did happen - battering , incest , lynching - were n't talked about . <p> Women and children were chattel . There were unsafe working conditions and no child labor laws . People were so repressed sexually that uncovered piano legs were offensive . It was a less compassionate time when women , children , minorities , the poor and gays were treated worse than they are now . <p> Instead of helping people , there was a hypocritical vindictiveness against those who did n't fit in . Shame on you , Newt , for wanting to return to those shameful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then whining when people call you names . Shame on you for helping the rich at the expense of the poor . <p> Shame on you for thinking that you are the emperor and God rolled into one ! <p> For special needs GAIL EVANS <p> Although a recent section on child care in the Atlanta area did a good job of highlighting the challenges facing families with small children as well as some of the resources available to them , it made no reference to the needs of HIV-positive and other medically frail children . <p> Since 1989 , ChildKind Inc. , a nonprofit organization , has existed to respond to this very special population . <p> One of the most important benefits provided to the children and their families is to shield them from the harmful psychological damage of being ostracized and shunned because of their illness . As too many families have painfully discovered , many day-care centers refuse to accept children who are HIV-positive because of fear and ignorance of the disease and its communicability . <p> However , these children - like all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , care and advocacy . <p> Evans is executive director of the International ChildKind Foundation , based in Atlanta . <p> Save Cumberland LaVONNE OTWELL , Marietta <p> I was appalled as I read a recent article on proposed further development on Cumberland Island . As a frequent visitor , I can only express my disgust at the proposal that an artists colony would not intrude on the already-threatened beauty of this wondrous place . <p> I invite anyone to look at the " artists colony " of Sedona , Ariz. , for comparison . It started innocently enough , but now is nothing but strip shops , outlet centers , trailers and every other monstrosity that " developers " can dream up to make a buck and move on . <p> So what if Plum Orchard falls into rack and ruin ? It is not the " heritage " ; the island is the heritage for all of us , not ( just ) the wealthy few . Just look at the gazebo as the harbinger of things to come . It is an abomination ! The beach view is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so why allow structures to ruin the view in the other direction ? <p> We visited three years ago and were treated to the magnificent sight of wild horses guarding mother and newborn at the base of the dunes on the beach . It is a sight I will never forget , and one that will disappear with invasion . <p> Why do we revere buildings over nature ? One word : Money ! <p> Let Plum Orchard rot ; keep Cumberland free of polluting development . It is the only reminder of our real heritage : the Earth . <p> The mighty IRS DICK GRUBB , Gainesville <p> If there was ever a time for Congress to abolish the IRS , the recent article concerning the procedures for auditors to investigate possible tax evasion should provide it with considerable ammunition . <p> An agency that has its own court system and its own set of laws now wants to intrude even further into citizens ' lives . Instead of just demanding documented evidence of compliance with tax regulations , they now will determine if you spent the money they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> According to the article , the IRS will check to see if the car you are driving or the house you are living in is within their guidelines for your income . If a person making $ 30,000 a year is driving a Lincoln , they will now assume you are guilty of tax fraud . <p> It 's bad enough the IRS can confiscate your property without following the normal laws of our country . Now they want to force you to live within what they perceive to be an acceptable way to spend your income . Will they start checking your trash to see if you are drinking imported beer instead of less-expensive domestic brands ? Or buying silk boxer shorts instead of cotton briefs ? <p> We should urge our senators and representatives to get rid of this overpowering agency and bring sanity to the collection of taxes . <p> No pity for ' bureaucrat ' MARY ROLINSON <p> The word " bureaucrat " should not be in quotes in a recent headline about Gwinnett County Assistant Superintendent Martha Brady . Her job is a breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky to receive half the salary the administrator does . <p> Brady can go to the bathroom when she needs to , not just during her planning or lunch period ; she can have time to think , run errands and make phone calls while driving her car all over Gwinnett County or sitting in her trailer-office . She can take coffee breaks and lunch when she wants ; and she never has to face a classroom filled to capacity with young , active , inquisitive and sometimes emotionally troubled , learning- disabled or disruptive children . <p> How can this woman justify her salary of $ 72,000 and perhaps even the existence of her position when she 's not even fighting for what the teachers at Minor Elementary School expressed that they really need - smaller classes and more planning time ? <p> Rolinson is a former Georgia public school teacher . Dining by gender LINDA PATRICK , Atlanta Wait a minute ! <p> Would ( food critic ) Elliott Mackle have written - or the Journal- Constitution have published - the following lines in response to a reader 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the finest - treat every customer with equal courtesy every time . Various rationales behind second- rate treatment of African-Americans in restaurants may be cited - ranging from racism ( that African-Americans who appear in public unprotected by whites after dark are not " nice " ) to economic ( some people perceive African-Americans as low tippers ) . <p> " African-Americans planning to dine together or on their own should plan ahead . Many African-Americans feel more secure when the restaurant 's owner , chef or host is also African-American . Calling ahead to reserve a table , explain the situation or merely scout the territory is wise . Look for neighborhood places with well-lit parking lots and entries . " <p> The Journal-Constitution did publish the above lines , verbatim , if " woman " is substituted for " African-American " and " man " is substituted for " white . " I think Mr. Mackle unwittingly gave a very good answer to the reader 's question : " Do women , when dining without men , experience discrimination even in finer restaurants ? " <p> Love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent article titled " Residents see red over ' green card ' " : <p> The article indicated that many immigrant " permanent residents " were upset over having to pay $ 75 to renew their old pre-1979 " green cards . " One German lady who has been living in the United States for 28 years complained of the inconvenience of having to appear in person and pay the fee . <p> Pardon me , but I feel this is a ridiculously small price to pay for someone who has enjoyed the benefits and freedoms of the United States for most of her life . Why do n't these people simply become U.S. citizens ?
