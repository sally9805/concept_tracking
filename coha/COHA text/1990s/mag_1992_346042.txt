TITLE : TWO TRAINS RUNNING <P> AUTHOR : AUGUST WILSON <P> WHERE : BROADWAY <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : The foremost American stage voice of his generation does it again , with delicacy and maturity . <P> Before August Wilson was a playwright , he was a poet . Although he came to the theater out of the black anger and community activism of the ' 60s , he was always more interested in language than in agenda , more sensitive to metaphors than to manifestos . At his lyrical best , which he certainly is in the remarkable play that reached Broadway last week after two years of regional development , Wilson can embed subtle and complex political commentary within the conversational riffs of fully realized characters . He can also end an almost actionless slice of life with an abrupt burst of violence , then instantly transmute that too into a redemptive act of  --  well , pure poetry . <P> Two Trains Running is Wilson 's most delicate and mature work , if not necessarily his most explosive or dramatic . It has none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fences ( 1987 ) and The Piano Lesson ( 1990 ) . This one never telegraphs the moments when it is going to turn philosophical and declaim what it means . Although the subject is nothing less than the whole range of political , social and philosophical options by which black people have lived for the past couple of decades , the story remains , to all appearances , a glimpse of everyday existence circa 1969 in a run-down Pittsburgh luncheonette . <P> The characters , exquisitely played under Lloyd Richards ' direction , are a gallery of types but come across as individuals . Among them , the restaurant owner , Memphis ( Al White ) , is a former Mississippian who was cheated of his property and driven from his farmstead for the crime of succeeding where a white man had failed . Risa ( Cynthia Martells ) , the restaurant 's sole waitress , gets her hope from religion and prophecy . Wolf ( Anthony Chisholm ) is a petty criminal , a numbers runner for the white Mob who gets along by going along . Sterling ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hood ) is a rambunctious no-hoper , fresh out of prison and fated to return . <P> In the showiest role , Roscoe Lee Browne plays the neighborhood wise man . He - has reached age 65 by staying out of other people 's business , suppressing his darkest rages and heeding a back-street seeress who purports to be 322 years old . He is at once dignified and absurd , wrongheaded and admirable . It is such affectionate ambivalence toward all the characters that makes Wilson 's play a vivid and uplifting tone poem and never a mere polemic . W.A.H.III
