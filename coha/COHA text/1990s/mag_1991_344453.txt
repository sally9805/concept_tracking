Marley and Frances Kendall have little to celebrate this Labor Day . Marley , 55 , lost his job as a Four Star Bus Lines driver last May . Two months later , Frances , 45 , was out of work when the state of Minnesota shut an unemployment- claims office where she had been a clerk for nearly 15 years . The double whammy has forced their son Marley Jr . to drop out of college and the Kendalls to move from their cherished lakeside home near the town of Ely to the Sunbelt to look for jobs . The prospect of uprooting is especially painful , Frances says , " when you 've worked all your life and you want something for your later years . " <P> This recession may be at or near an end , but the Kendalls and millions of other U.S. layoff victims could find it difficult , if not impossible , to find new jobs . Squeezed by foreign competition and the vast debt load that companies assumed in the 1980s , American firms can no longer afford to hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after past recessions . Quite the contrary : as banks , retailers , computer makers , defense contractors and other firms from Boston to Burbank slash their payrolls in the face of falling profits , experts say nearly half the 1.6 million jobs the economy has lost in just the past 13 months may never be restored . <P> That grim prospect will further dampen what is already shaping up as the weakest U.S. upturn since World War II . " Even if there were no recession , there would still be massive layoffs , " says Hugh Johnson , chief economist for the New York securities firm First Albany . " People are going to lose their jobs , and they are not going to be rehired . " Concurs Allen Sinai , chief economist for the Boston Co . Economic Advisers : " The name of the game is to hold down the nose count . " <P> The corporate downsizing has inspired doubts about whether the slump that began in July 1990 has really ended . In the latest sign of hard times , the Commerce Department last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second quarter this year , marking the third straight quarter of decline . While many economists still predict that the U.S. will show at least slight growth for the third quarter , the report indicated just how shaky the economy has become . And consumers , whose purchases account for two-thirds of the GNP , could become increasingly reluctant to spend . The government said last week that the personal income of Americans fell 0.1% in July , breaking a string of five monthly gains . <P> Continued layoffs have left many people nervous despite some recent signals that conditions may improve . In one such report , Commerce said last week that its index of leading economic indicators rose a strong 1.2% in July . At the same time , Commerce said orders for factory goods surged 6.2% in July , the biggest gain in 21 years . <P> While strong government action helped pull the U.S. out of past recessions , Washington this time seems powerless to play its traditional role of jump- starting the economy . The massive federal deficits that helped fuel the creation of 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts or spending programs politically and economically anathema . Moreover , the Federal Reserve Board has resisted spurring job growth by sharply dropping interest costs , lest the tactic speed up a relatively modest 3% inflation rate .
