DIY15.0AE$ TEMP$ PAPER:CHICAGO SUN-TIMES <p> Researchers this week resumed heated discussions of DIY Syndrome , popularly known as " remodeling fever , " and said the number of suspected cases has shot up in Chicago . <p> DIY seems to surge between Labor Day and Thanksgiving , but the wide variety of symptoms makes accurate diagnosis problematic . Is a daylong spending spree at Home Depot an innocent splurge or DIY ? <p> Experts have nearly come to blows over some diagnoses , but they agree on two recent cases : In one , the shopper barricaded herself in the hand tool department using a demonstration nail gun and marked-down plywood . In the other , the shopper redesigned a store 's loading dock and had started demolition when the police arrived . <p> Treatment is difficult . Hospitals have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banded together in a Long Beach clinic and rewired the senior staff cafeteria . Some families wait for the fever to subside ; the more cost-conscious channel it into positive behavior : " Mom had that new bathroom tiled in no time . " <p> Researchers noted that some patients have been mistaken for professional contractors . One marked difference is that contractors receive money . Fever victims dispense it  --  almost compulsively , always by check or charge card since they rarely have cash . In fact , the syndrome abates significantly when the money runs out . Experts believe a cure may lie in that direction . <p> For now , however , researchers have conducted lengthy interviews with patients , families and retailers to compile the following symptoms . If a person displays three or more of these , he or she should not be allowed in paint stores unaccompanied . <p> 1 . Fingers match woodwork ( Danish walnut ) , end tables ( pearly ash ) and that rocking chair retrieved from the alley ( distressed persimmon ) . ( Note : Not one manicurist agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 . Favorite T-shirts make reliable color charts . ( Research assistant asked , " Is that Candlelight Mist ? " and was promptly set straight : " No , it 's mayonnaise . " ) <p> 3 . Has noticed that downstairs neighbors move frequently . ( One family 's doctor thinks he can get their earplugs out without anesthesia . ) <p> 4 . Idea of a fun date is belt sander races . <p> 5 . Has personal shoppers at Handy Andy and Builders Square . ( This happens only in very advanced cases . It has been likened to a football fan sitting in a stadium for one game while watching another on portable TV and listening to a third on radio . ) <p> 6 . Has home phone number of every tile distributor in Elk Grove Village  --  and knows their birthdays . <p> 7 . Tells kids heaven is just like " This Old House , " except Norm and Steve have wings and little golden hammers . <p> 8 . Instead of Playboy or Reader 's Digest , keeps blueprints in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers of cheap tacky tool belts should be made to sleep in them . ( Owns 14 tool belts . Latest one cost $ 125 . ) <p> 10 . Traded the family car for a pickup . <p> 11 . Does n't always recognize children born after onset of fever ( " You 're sure we have three ? " ) but can identify drill bits blindfolded . <p> 12 . Refuses to leave home without a 25-foot tape measure . <p> 13 .
