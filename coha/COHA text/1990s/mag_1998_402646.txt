IRWIN LODGE OFFERS THE SPOILS OF BACKCOUNTRY SKIING WITHOUT THE EFFORT . BY CINDY HIRSCHFELD // One of my favorite sensations-and I know I 'm not alone here-is the weightlessness of skiing powder . That nanosecond during a turn when it 's just me and my skis , gravity is purely a figment of Newton 's imagination , and the spell is broken only by the soft swoosh of snow against my legs as I prepare for the next microflight . Every winter I live for those moments . If necessary , I 'll hike long and high in search of the untracked . So with its acres upon acres of virgin snow , Irwin Lodge snowcat resort struck me as offering a whole season of powder gluttony rolled into a few days . A trip to Irwin begins at the eponymous Trailhead , a staging area just south of Crested Butte where plowing of the road over Kebler Pass ends . Amid a fleet of parked cars and snowmobiles that constitutes a sort of winter Park-and-Ride for locals , my ski partner , Sean , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with treads instead of wheels , it looks like a soccer mom 's personal tank . The eight-mile ride up to the lodge , just north of Lake Irwin , takes about a half hour . Fresh off a five-day backcountry hut trip , we 're looking forward to the luxury of being chauf feured to the goods via one of the lodge 's three Bombardier snowcats . Our first morning dawns clear , and 2,200 acres of natural , almost entirely ungroomed terrain-open bowls , glades , tight trees , chutes-glisten around us . At an elevation of 10,700 feet , Irwin is situated in a fortuitous weather pocket . Storms coming in from Utah smack up against the adjacent Ruby Range and unleash an average of 600 inches of snow annually . With a maximum daily load of 33 skiers , plus guides , it can take up to three weeks for the place to get really tracked out . We begin the day skiing down Dan 's Delight , one of only two maintained groomers , which gives the guides a chance to assess the group 's skiing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice late-March crust . ( With two guides per cat , skiers or riders may be broken up into smaller groups for the descents if ability levels vary widely . ) After the next cat ride up , we scoot down 70 Gully , decorating its short , steep pitch with a series of smoothly etched Ss . Soon we find sunsoftened snow in Independence Basin 's Anarchy Bowl . By virtue of its exposure , Indy holds the best snow , and on a clear day the view takes in the towering Maroon Bells and Pyramid Peak near Aspen , 14,092-foot Snowmass Mountain just beyond , and the islandlike Grand Mesa to the west . We spend the rest of the morning exploring here , taking a few more exuberant runs . One thing is clear from the terrain : Though Sean and I are no longer on our hut trip , we 're still most definitely in the backcountry . We head back down to the lodge for the buffet-style lunch-an appealing spread of sandwich fixings , salads , homemade soup , and a couple of hot entrees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling . ) With extra homebaked cookies in hand , we ride postlunch to the West Wall , site of Irwin 's steepest terrain , including a series of steep tree shots that produce a stream of weightless moments . Life was n't always this good at Irwin . Sitting in front of the lodge 's massive rock fireplace that evening after skiing , Jeff Antonczyk and Brad Baetz , who have both guided at the resort for the better part of a decade , fill me in on some of the history . The lodge itself dates back to 1976 , when Dan Thurman , flush with money from the aviation industry , built it as his private retreat . Ten years later he sold it , and for the next decade the lodge was plagued with financial and management troubles . Finally , early in the summer of 1996 , the septic system sprung a leak and the owners were issued a cease-and-desist order by the county ( giving the phrase " ran it into the ground " a whole new meaning ) .

So , guides like Brad Baetz ( inset ) have little trouble finding untracked lines . // Enter the somewhat ominous-sounding Irwin Ten , the diverse group of investors who now own the lodge . Taos realtor David Buck , who had spent a week at the lodge a few years before and had , he says , " fallen in love with the uniqueness of it , " spearheaded the purchase after reading in a magazine that Irwin was for sale . The deal was made final in February 1997 , and that summer the new owners went to work , building a state-of-the-art sewage-treatment facility , replacing the roof and carpet , making some structural changes , and buying a new snowcat and snowmobile fleet . And they wisely dropped the somewhat selfprophesying marketing tag , " The bestkept secret in the Rockies . " Now the facilities are on a par with the skiing . The lodge 's cavernous main floor is broken up into smaller seating arrangements , with a large-screen TV , extensive video library , pool and Foosball tables , and numerous games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're simply furnished yet comfy ( though the walls are on the thin side ) . After dinner Sean and I wander into the Irwin bar , a separate room at the lodge 's west end . It 's a true locals ' hangout , except in this case the locals arrive by snowmobile , driving up either from Crested Butte or from the Townsite a couple of miles down the road ( where the bustling silver camp of Irwin sprang up more than a hundred years ago ) . I 'm in bed by 11 , lights-out time , when the lodge 's generator-provided electricity is cut back to partial power . Did I mention that there is no regular phone service ? The next day again begins bright and clear , and our crew of both skiers and snowboarders wastes no time in heading to Indy Basin . One of the sweetest runs is reached via a long , rolling traverse to the east , from which we can peer down into Elk Basin , skiable but not without a hike out . Instead we head for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wind- and sun-protected kneedeep snow . I lose sight of the others as we each pick individual lines through the trees , but one by one we all wind up in Roadkill Bowl , so called because , despite the guides ' warnings , someone always biffs on the four-foot drop at the bottomour group is no exception . In addition to that run , the one that leaves the greatest impression in my mind is Indy Express . On the west side of Indy Bowl , the eastfacing 38-degree pitch is the perfect blank slate for about 600-vertical feet of rhythmic turns ending in a fast runout . That evening I sit by one of the large picture windows that line the lodge 's main floor , watching as a light dusting of snow sprinkles down . The sun breaks through the clouds , bathing the peaks of the nearby Anthracite Range in an apricot glow . This place , I realize , wo n't remain secret " for very long . r Photograph Daytime views at Irwin are spectacular-the view from the couch ai n't so bad either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
