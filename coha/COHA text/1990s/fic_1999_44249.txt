The problem with trying to use your superior knowledge to shape somebody else 's life is that he may have the same idea . Photograph <p> Justin Kloster looked from his blue book to his watch and back again . He muttered under his breath . Around him , a hundred more peopie in the American history class were looking at their watches , too . Fifteen minutes left . After that , another breadth requirement behind him . His junior year behind him , too . Three down , one to go . At precisely four o'clock , the professor said , " Time ! Bring your blue books up to the front of the lecture hall . " like everybody else , Justin squeezed out another couple of sentences before doing as he was told . He wrung his hand to show writer 's cramp , then stuck the pen in the pocket of his jeans and headed for the door . " How do you think you did ? " somebody asked him . " I 'm pretty sure I got a B , anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really need . It 's not like it 's my major or anything . " The prof could hear him , but he did n't much care . This was n't a course for history majors , not that Cal State Northridge had many of those . It was a school for training computer people like him , business types , and teachers . After a moment , he thought to ask , " How about you ? " " Probably about the same , " the other fellow said . " Well , have a good summer . " " Yeah , you , too . " Justin opened the door and stepped from air conditioning and pale fluorescent light into the brassy sun and heat of the San Fernando Valley . He blinked a couple of times as his eyes adapted . Sweat started pouring off him , He hurried across campus to the parking lot where his Toyota waited . He was very blond and very fair@ and sunburned if you looked at him sideways . He was also a little-only a little-on the round side , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , he fanned the door back and forth a couple of times to get rid of the furnacelike air inside . He cranked the AC as soon as he started the motor . After he 'd gone a couple of blocks , it started doing some good . He 'd just got comfortable when he pulled into the gated driveway of his apartment building . The Acapulco was like a million others in Los Angeles , with a below-ground parking lot and two stories of apartments built above it around a courtyard that held a swimming pool , a rec room , and a couple of flower beds whose plants kept dying The key that opened the security gate also opened the door between the lot and the lobby . Justin checked his snailmail and found , as he 'd hoped , a check from his father and another from his mother . His lip curled as he scooped the envelopes from his little mailbox . His folks had gone through a messy divorce his senior year in high school . These days , his father was living with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was-and his mother was living with a dark-haired woman only a couple of years older than he was . They both sent money to help keep him in his apartment ... and so they would n't have to have anything more to do with him . That suited him fine . He did n't want to have anything to do with them these days , either . He used the security key again to get from the lobby to the courtyard behind it , then walked back to his apartment , which was n't far from the rec room . That had worried him when he first rented the place , but hardly anybody played table tennis or shot pool or lifted weights , so noise was n't a problem . His apartment was no neater than it had to be . His history text and lecture notes covered the kitchen table . He chuckled as he shoved them aside . " No more pencils , no more books , no more teachers " dirty looks , " he chanted-and how long had people escaping from school been singing that song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit down in front of the space he 'd cleared . Then he shook his head and carried the soda back into the bedroom instead . He really lived there . His Mac sat on a desk in a corner by the closet . Justin grinned when he booted it up . It did n't look like all the boring beige boxes other companies made . As soon as the desktop came up , he logged onto Earthlink to check his e-mail and see what was going on in some of the newsgroups he read . None of the e-mail was urgent , or even very interesting . The newsgroups ... " How about that ? " he said a couple of minutes later . Dave and Tabitha , who 'd both been posting in the Trash Can Sinatras newsgroup for as long as he 'd been reading it , announced they were getting married . Justin sent congratulations . He hoped they 'd get on better than his own folks had . His girlfriend 's parents were still together , and still seemed to like each other pretty well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He logged off Earthlink-having only one line in the apartment was a pain-and went over to the phone on the nightstand . He dialed and listened to it ring , once , twice ... " Hello ? " she said . " What 's the story , morning glory ? " Justin said-Megan was wild for Oasis . He liked British pop , too , though he preferred Pulp , as someone of his parents " generation might have liked the Stones more than the Beatles . " Oh . Hiya , Justin . " He heard the smile in her voice once she recognized his . He smiled , too . With exams over for another semester , with his girlfriend glad to hear from him , the world looked like a pretty good place . Megan asked , " How 'd your final go ? " " Whatever , " he answered . " I do n't think it 's an A , but I 'm pretty sure it 's a B , and that 's good enough . Want to go out tonight and party ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've got my English lit final tomorrow , remember ? " " Oh , yeah . That 's right . " Justin had n't remembered till she reminded him . " I bet you 're glad to get through with most of that lower-division stuff . " She was a year behind him . " This was n't so bad . " Megan spoke as if telling a dark , shameful secret : " I kind of like Shakespeare . " Whatever , " Justin said again . All he remember from his literature course was that he 'd been damn lucky to escape with a B-minus . " I 'll take you to Sierra 's . We can get margaritas . How 's that ? " " The bomb , " Megan said solemnly . " What time ? " " How about six-thirty ? I start at CompUSA tomorrow , and I 'll get off a litde past five . " " Okay , see you then , " Megan said . " I 've got to get back to Macbeth . " Bye . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favorite Pulp album , in the CD player and pulled dinner out of the freezer at random . When he saw what he had , he put it back and got another one : if he was going to Sierra 's tomorrow night , he did n't want Mexican food tonight , too . Plain old fried chicken would do the job well enough . He nuked it , washed it down with another Coke , then threw the tray and the can into the trash and the silverware into the dishwasher . When he started running out of forks , he 'd get everything clean at once . He went back into the bedroom , surfed the Net without much aim for a while , and then went over to bungie.corn and got into a multiplayer game of Myth 11 . His side took gas ; one of the guys did n't want to follow their captain 's orders , even though his own ideas were a long way from brilliant . Justin logged off in disgust . He fired up his Carmageddon CD-ROM and happily ran down little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was after eleven . " Work tomorrow , " he sighed , and shut down and went to bed . Freshly showered , freshly shaved , a gold stud in his left ear , he drove over to Megan 's parents " house to pick her up . Her mother let him in . " How are you , Justin ? " she said . " How do you like your new job ? " " I 'm fine , Mrs. Tricoupis , " he answered . " The job's-okay , I guess . " One day had been plenty to convince him his supervisor was a doofus . The guy did n't know much about computers , and , because he was pushing thirty , he thought he could lord it over Justin and the other younger people at the store . Megan 's mom caught Justin 's tone . Laughing , she said , " Welcome to the real world . " She turned and called toward the back of the house : " Sweetie ! Justin 's here ! " " I 'm coming , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a slim , almost skinny brunette with more energy than she sometimes knew what to do with . " Hiya , " she told Justin . The way she looked at him , she might have invented him . " Hi . " Justin felt the same way about her . He wanted to grab her right then and there . If her mother had n't been standing three feet away , he would have done it . Mrs. Tricoupis laughed again , on a different note . It did n't occur to Justin that she could see through Megan and him . She said , " Go on , kids . Have fun . Drive carefully , Justin . " " Whatever , " Justin said , which made Megan 's mom roll her eyes up to the heavens . But he 'd been in only one wreck since getting his license , and that one had n't quite been his fault , so he could n't see why she was ragging on him . He did n't grab Megan when they got into the car , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned toward each other and into a long , wet kiss that lasted till the light turned green and even longer-till , in fact , the old fart in the SUV behind them leaned on his horn and made them both jump . Sierra 's had stood at the corner of Vanowen and Canoga for more than forty years , which made it a Valley institution . They both ordered margaritas as they were seated , Megan 's strawberry , Justin 's plain . The waiter nodded to her but told Justin , " I 'm sorry , senor , but I 'll need some ID . " " Okay . " Justin displayed his driver 's license , which showed he 'd been born in April 1978 , and so had been legal for a couple of months . " Gradas , senor , " the waiter said . " I 'll get you both your drinks . " Justin and Megan did n't start quietly giggling till . he was gone . Megan was only twenty , but people always carded Justin . The margaritas were good . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You did n't even ask me how I did on my final . " " Duh ! " Justin hit himself in the forehead with the heel of his hand . " How did you do ? " " Great , " she said happily . " I think I might even have gotten an A. " " That rocks . " Justin made silent clapping motions . Megan took a seated bow . He went on , " How do you feel like celebrating ? " " Well , we probably ought to save club-hopping for the weekend , since you 've got to go to work in the morning . " Megan stuck out her tongue at him . " See ? I think about what 's going on with you . " Justin started to get chuffed , but did n't let it show . A couple of seconds later , he was glad he did n't , because Megan went on , " So why do n't we just go back to your place after dinner ? " " Okay , " he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did ; Megan started laughing at him . But it was n't mean laughter , and she did n't change what she 'd said . He raised his margarita to his lips . At twenty-one , it 's easy to think you 've got the world by the tail . He hardly noticed what he ordered . When the waiter brought it , he ate it . It was good ; the food at Sierra 's always was . Afterwards , he had to remember to stay somewhere close to the speed limit as he drove up Canoga toward the Acapulco . Getting a ticket would interrupt everything else he had in mind . When he opened the door to let Megan into his apartment , she said , " You 're so lucky to have a place of your own. , " I guess so , " Justin answered . He thought she was pretty lucky to have parents who cared enough about her to want her to stay at home while she went through college . As far as he was concemed , the checks his father and mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have . He 'd tried explaining that , but he 'd seen it made no sense to her She bent down and went pawing through his CDs and put on I 've Seen Everything , the Trash Can Sinatras " second album . As " Easy Road " started coming out of the stereo , she sighed . " They were such a good band . I wish they 'd made more than three records before they broke up . " " Yeah , " Justin said . However much he liked the Sinatras , though , he did n't pay that much attention to the music . Instead , he watched her straighten and get to her feet . He stepped forward to slip an arm around her waist . She turned and smiled at him from a range of about six inches , as if she 'd forgotten he was there and was glad to be reminded . " Hiya , " she said brightly , and put her arms around him . Who kissed whom first was a matter of opinion . They went back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of months . Justin was still learning what Megan liked . He did n't quite get her where she was going before he rather suddenly arrived himself . " Sorry , " he said as his heartrate slowed toward normal . " Wait a few minutes and we 'll try it again . " It was only a few minutes , too . At his age , he could-and-did take that for granted . After the second time , he asked , " Better ? " " Yeah , " Megan answered in a breathy voice that meant it was quite a bit better Or maybe that breathy voice meant something else altogether , for she was still using it as she went on , " Get up , will you ? You 're squashing me . " " Oh . " Justin slid his weight-too much weight , he thought , not for the first time-off her . " I did n't mean to . " " A gentleman , " she said darkly , " takes his weight on his elbows . " But she laughed as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad . Justin scratched his stomach , which gave him an excuse to feet how too much of it there was . He was n't really tubby . He 'd never been really tubby . But he would never have six-pack abs , either . Twelve-pack or maybe a whole case , yeah . Six-pack ? Real live muscles ? Fuhgeddaboutit . Unlike some other girls he 'd known , Megan had never given him a hard time about it . " Shall we go down to the Probe Friday night ? " he said . " They do n't have me working Saturday , so we can close the place and see what kind of after-hours stuff we can dig up . " " All right , " Megan said . She slid off the bed and went into the bathroom . When she came back , she started dressing . Justin had half hoped for a third round , but it was n't urgent . He put his clothes on again , too . The drive back to Megan 's house passed in happy silence . Justin kept glancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty lucky fellow , he thought , finding a girl I can ... Then he clicked his tongue between his teeth . He did n't even want to think the word love . After he 'd watched his parents " messy breakup , that word scared the hell out of him . But it kept coming back whether he wanted it to or not . He told himself that was a good sign , and came close to believing it . The Probe lay a couple of blocks off Melrose , the heart of the L.A. scene . Justin snagged a parking space in front of a house not far away Megan gave him a hand . " I thought we 'd have to hike for , like , miles , " she said . " Well , we 've got the shoes for it , " Justin said , which made her grin . They both wore knockoffs of Army boots , big and black and massive , with soles that looked as if they 'd been cut from tractor tire treads . Justin made sure he put the Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . Things in this neighborhood had a way of walking with Jesus if you were n't careful . He and Megan had no trouble snagging a table when they got inside the Probe . " Guard it with your life , " he told her , and went over to the bar to buy a beer . He got carded again , and had to haul out his license . He brought the brew back to Megan , who could n't pass the ID test , then got another one for himself . They both eyed the deejay 's booth , which was as yet uninhabited . " Who 's it supposed to be tonight ? " Megan asked . Before Justin could answer , she went on , " I hope it 's Helen . She plays the best mix of anybody , and she 's not afraid to spin things you do n't hear every day . " " I du n no , " Justin said . " I like Douglas better , I think . He wo n't scramble tempos the way Helen does sometimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Megan snorted . " Give me a break . I have to drag you out there half the time . " " Proves my point , " Justin said . " I need all the help I can get . " " Well , maybe , " Megan said : no small concession . She and Justin analyzed and second-guessed deejays the way football fans played Monday-morning quarterback , Their arguments got just as abstruse and sometimes just as heated , too . Megan did n't drop it cold here : she said , " As long as it 's not Michael . " Justin crossed his forefingers , as if warding off a vampire . " Anybody but Michael , " he agreed . " I do n't know how they can keep using him . His list is so lame-my father would like most of it . " He could find no stronger condemnation . A couple of minutes later , a skinny redheaded guy with a buzz cut even shorter than justin 's , little tiny sunglasses , and a silver lip ring that glittered under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's Douglas , " Megan said . She did n't sound too disappointed ; she liked him next best after Helen . " Yeah ! " Justin let out a whoop and clapped till his hands hurt . A lot of people in the club were doing the same ; Douglas had a considerable following . But there were also scattered boos , and even one raucous shout of , " We want Michael ! " Justin and Megan looked at each other and both mouthed the same word : losers . Douglas did n't waste time with chatter . That was another reason Justin liked him-he did n't come to the Probe for foreplay . As soon as the music started blaring out , an enormous grin spread over his face . He did n't even grumble when Megan sprang up , grabbed him , and hauled him out onto the floor . He gave it his best shot . With the bass thudding through him like the start of an earthquake , how could he do anything else ? Tomorrow , he knew , his ears would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right for a couple of days . But he 'd worry about that later , if he worried at all . He was having a good time , and nothing else mattered . Somewhere a little past midnight , a guy with a pierced tongue drifted through the crowd passing out fliers Xeroxed on poisonously pink paper . RAVE ! was the headline in screamer type-and in a fancy font that was barely legible ; Justin , who 'd just taken a desktop-publishing course , would never have chosen it . Below , it gave an address a few blocks from the Probe and a smudgy map . " Wan na go ? " Justin asked when the thundering music stopped for a moment . Megan tossed her head to flip back her hair , then wiped her sweaty forehead with the sleeve of her tunic . " Sure ! " she said . After the Probe closed at two , people streamed out to their cars . The notquite-legal after-hours action-at which Justin saw a lot of the same faces-was in an empty warehouse . He 'd never been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . Dancing till whenever was even more fun than dancing till two , and there was always the chance the cops would show up and run everybody out . There were other ways to have fun at raves , too . A pretty blond girl carried an enormous purse full of plastic vials half full of orange fluid . " liquid Happiness ? " she asked when she came up to Justin and Megan . They looked at each other . Justin pulled out ten bucks . The girl gave him two vials . She went on her way . He handed Megan a vial . They both pulled out the stoppers and drank . They both made faces , too . The stuff tasted foul . The drugs you got at raves usually did . Justin and Megan started dancing again , waiting for the liquid Happiness to kick in . As far as Justin was concerned , it might as well have been Liquid Wooziness . He felt as if his head were only loosely attached to the rest of him . It was fun . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more alert to what was going on . Things broke up about a quarter to five . Justin 's head and the rest of him seemed a little more connected . He did n't have too much trouble driving back to the Valley . " Take you home or go back to my place ? " he asked Megan as he got off the Ventura Freeway and onto surface streets . " Yours , " Megan said at once . " We 're so late now , another half hour , forty-five minutes wo n't matter at all . " He reached out and set his hand on her thigh . " I like the way you think . " His boss knew even less about Macs than he did about other computers . Since said boss was convinced he knew everything about everything , persuading him of that took all the tact Justin had , and maybe a little more besides . He got home from CompUSA feeling as if he 'd gone through a car wash with his doors open . As usual , he sorted through his snailmail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , the first thing he did when he got to the apartment was toss most of it in the trash . And , as usual , the first worthwhile thing he did was turn on his computer and check e-mail . That was more likely to be interesting than what he got from the post office . At first , though , he did n't think it would be , not today . All he had were a couple of pieces of obvious spain and something from somebody he 'd never heard of who used AOL . His lip curled . As far as he was concerned , AOL was for people who could n't ride a bicycle without training wheels . But , with nothing more interesting showing on the monitor , he opened the message . He did n't know what he 'd been expecting . Whatever it was , it was n't what he got . Who butyou , the e-mail read , would know that the first time you jacked off , you were looking at Miss March 1993 , a little before your fifteenth birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I know is that I am you , more or less . Let me bear from you . The signature line read , Justin Kloster , age 40 . Justin Kloster , age twenty-one , stared at that : stared and stared and stared . He remembered Miss March 1993 very , very well . He remembered sneaking her into the bathroom at his parents " house , back in the days before they 'd decided to find themselves and lose him . He remembered not quite being sure what would happen as he fumbled with himself , and how much better reality had been than anything he 'd imagined . What he did n't remember was ever telling anybody about it . It was n't the sort of thing you advertised , that was for damn sure . Could he have mentioned it when he was shooting the buff with his buds , maybe after they 'd all had a few beers , or more than a few ? He shook his head . No way . He looked at the signature line again . Justin Kloster , age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't forty , thank God . Forty was the other side of the moon , the side old men lived on . Not really old , ancient , but old like his father . Old enough . The only thing that made the idea getting to forty even halfway appealing was that he might do it with Megan . After all , she 'd only be thirtynine then . What to do about the message ? He was tempted to delete it , forget it . But he could n't , not quite . He chose the REPLY function and typed , What kind of stupid joke is this ? Whatever it is , it 's not funny . He thought about adding Justin Ker , age 21 to it , but he did n't want to acknowledge it even enough to parody He sent the bald e-mail just the way it was : He walked out to the kitchen and threw a Hungry Man dinner in the microwave . As soon as it started , he opened the refrigerator and dithered between Coke and a beer . He seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an exception . He popped open a can of Coors Light and took a long pull . The beer slid down his throat , cold and welcome . As if drawn by a magnet , he went back to the computer He had no way of knowing when the smartass on AOL who signed himself with his own name would send more e-mail , or even if he 'd send any more at all . But the fellow might-and Justin spent a lot of time online just about every evening anyhow Sure as hell , new e-mail from that same address came in before the microwave buzzed to tell him his dinner was done . He took another big swig of beer , then opened the mail . No joke , it read . Who else but you would know you lost your first baby tooth in a pear at school when you were in thefirst grade ? Who else would know your dad fed you Rollos when he took you to work with him that day when you were eight or nine ? Who else would know you spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at , the mote on the side of Lindsey FIer 's neck ? Me , that 's who. - you at 40 . Justin Kloster . " Jesus ! " Justin said hoarsely . His hands were shaking so much , the beer slopped and splashed inside the can . He had to put the can down on the desk , or he would have spilled beer on his pants . Out in the kitchen , the microwave did let him know his dinner was ready . He heard it , but he hardly noticed . He could n't take his eyes off the iMac 's monitor Nobody knew that stuff about him . Nobody . He would have bet money neither his mother nor his father could have told how he lost his first tooth , or when . He would have bet more money his dad could n't have remembered those Rollos to save himself from a firing squad . As for lindsey Fletcher . . " No way , " he told the words , the impossible words , on the screen . Telling them that did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd known in high school . They 'd never even broken up , not in the sense of a fight or anything , but she 'd moved out to Simi Valley with her folks the summer his parents " marriage struck a mine , and they 'd stopped dating . A damn cute little blonde-but she did have that mole . Justin went to the kitchen , opened up his dinner , and carried it and a couple of dish towels and ( almost as an afterthought ) a knife and fork back into the bedroom . He put the towels in his lap so the dinner tray would n't bum his legs and started to eat . He hardly noticed what he was shoveling into his face . What do I say ? he kept wondering . What the hell do I say ? That depended on what he believed . He did n't know what the hell to believe . " Time travel ? " he said , and then shook his head . " Bullshit . " But if it was bullshit , how did the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , was out there , but how could anybody go about getting his hands on it ? The line made him decide how to answer . I do n't watch X-Files much , he typed , but maybe I ought to . How could you know all that about me ? I never told anybody about Lindsey Fletcher 's neck . Whoever the other guy was , he answered in a hurry . Justin imagined him leaning toward his computer , waiting for AOL 's stupid electronic voice to tell him , " You 've got mail ! " and then writing like a bastard . How do I know ? he said . I 've told you twice now-I know because I am you , you in 201 &; It 's not XFiles stuff-it 's good programming . Believe me , I 'm back here for a good reason . " Believe you ? " Justin yelped , as if the fellow sending him e-mail were there in the bedroom with him . " How am I supposed to believe you when you keep telling me shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only a little more politely . But that 's impossible , he wrote , and sent the message . Okay . The reply came back almost instantly . But if it is impossible , how do I know all this stuff about you ? That was a good question , what his grandfather called the sixty-four-dollar question . Justin would have been a lot happier had he had a sixty-four-dollar answer for it . Since he did n't , being flip would have to do . I do n't know , he wrote . How do you know all this stuff about me ? Because it 's stuff about me , too , said the fellow on the other end of the computer hookup . You do n't seem to be taking that seriously yet . Justin snorted . " Yeah , right , " he said . " Like I 'm supposed to take any of this crap seriously . Like anybody would . " He snapped his fingers and laughed out loud . " I 'll fix you , you son of a bitch . Hassle me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're supposed to be me , then you 'll look like me , right ? He laughed again . That 'd shut Mr. Mindgames up , by God . Except it did n't . Again , the reply came back very fast . Right , wrote the stranger who claimed to be his older self Meet me in front of the B. Dalton 's in the Northridge mall tomorrow night at 6:30 and I 'll buy you dinner You 'll see for yourself . " Huh , " Justin said . He had n't expected to have his bluff called . He had n't thought it was a bluff . He typed three defiant words-See you there-sent them off , and shut down his iMac . It was still early , but he 'd had enough electronic weirdness for one night . Like Topanga Plaza , the Northridge mall was one of Justin 's favorite places . He 'd spent a lot of time at both of them , shopping and killing things at the arcade ( though Topanga , for some reason , did n't have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by himself . He 'd been especially glad of places to be by himself when his parents " marriage went south . Northridge had just reopened then , after staying shut for a year and a half after the big quake in " 94 . If they 'd let him , he would have visited it while it was in ruins . Even that would have beat the warfare going on at his house . He parked in the open lot on the south side of the mall , near the Sears . Everyone swore up and down that the new parking structures they 'd built since the earthquake would n't come crashing down the way the old ones had . Maybe it was even true . Justin did n't care to find out by experiment . His apartment was air-conditioned . His Toyota was air-conditioned . He worked up a good sweat walking a hundred feet from the car to the entrance under the Sears facade that was also new since the quake . Summer was here early this year , and felt ready to stay for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . The mall , thank God , was also air-conditioned . He sighed with pleasure at escaping the Valley heat again . He walked through the Sears toward the entryway into the rest of the mall . None of the men 's clothing he passed looked interesting . Some of it was for businessmen-not particularly successful businessmen , or they would n't shop at Sears . The rest of the clothes were casual , but just as unexciting . An escalator took Justin up to the second level . The B. Dalton 's was on the right-hand side as he went north , not too far past the food court in the middle of the mall . He paused a couple of times to eye pretty girls sauntering pastyeah , he was seeing Megan all the time and happy about that , but it did n't mean he was blind . One of the girls smiled at him . He was n't foolish enough to let himself get distracted . Not quite . Past the food court , on toward the bookstore . A guy was leaning against the brushed-aluminum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , baggy jeans , and Army boots . He 'd been looking the other way . Now he swung his head back toward Justin-and he had Justin 's face . Justin stopped in his tracks . He felt woozy , almost ready to pass out , as if he 'd stood up too suddenly from a chair . He had to grab the rail himself , to keep from falling down . He did n't know what he 'd expected . That the other guy 's email might be simple truth had never crossed his mind . He wanted to get the hell out of there . His older self also looked a little green around the gills . And why not ? He was meeting himself for the first time , too . Justin made himself keep going When he got up to himself-at-forty , his older self stuck out a hand and said , " Hi . Thanks for coming . " His voice did n't sound the way Justin 's did in his own ears , but it did sound the way he sounded when he got captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matched so well . " Maybe I 'm not crazy , " Justin said slowly . " Maybe you 're not crazy , either . You look just like me . " He studied his older self . Despite the buzz cut that matched his own , despite the Cow Pi T-shirt , he thought himself-at-forty did look older . But he did n't look a lot older . He did n't took anywhere close to the age he was claiming " Funny how that works , " his older self said with a tight smile . He was sharper , more abrupt , than Justin . He acted like a goddamn adult , in other words . And , acting like an adult , as if he knew everything there was to know just because he had some years under his belt , he automatically ticked Justin off . Justin put his hands on his hips and said , " Prove you 're from the future . " Maybe this guy was a twin separated at birth . Maybe he was no relation , but a double anyhow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self reached into the pocket of his jeans and pulled out a little blue plastic coin purse , the kind only a grownup would use . Squeezing it open , he took out a quarter . " Here-this is for you . " He gave it to Justin . It lay in Justin 's hand eagle side up . Justin turned it over . It still looked like any other quarter ... till he saw the date . He thought his eyes would bug out of his head . " It 's from 2012 , " he whispered . " Jesus . You were n't kidding . " Four little numbers stamped onto a coin , and the reality of what he 'd just walked into hit him over the head like a club . " I told you I was n't . " His older self sounded like an adult talking down to a kid . That helped convince him , too . Himself-at-forty continued , " Come on . What 's the name of that Korean barbecue place over on Reseda ? " " The Pine Tree ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken Megan there once , and she 'd liked it , too . " Yeah . " Himself-at-forty sounded as if he 'd needed reminding . Did that mean he did n't go there in 2018 ? Before the question could do anything more than cross Justin 's mind , his older self went on , " Let 's go over there . I 'll buy you dinner , like I said in e-mail , and we can talk about things . " justin was hungry-he usually ate din ner earlier-but that was n't tops on his list . He came out with what was : " Like what you 're doing here . " His older self nodded . " Yeah . Like what I 'm doing here . " As often as not , Justin and whomever he was with turned out to be the only Caucasians in the Pine Tree . He and Megan had been . He and his older self were , too . The waitresses were all Korean ; none of them spoke a whole lot of English . Himself-at-forty ordered marinated beef and pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tabletop . He ordered a couple of tall OB beers , too . Justin nodded at that . God knew he could use a beer right now As their waitress wrote down the order , she kept looking from his older self to Justin and back again . " Twins , " she said at last . " Yeah , " himself-at-forty said . Justin wondered if he was lying or telling the truth . Damned if I know , he thought as the waitress headed back to the kitchen . He wanted to giggle . This whole business was too bizarre for words . Instead of giggling , he pointed at his older self . " Tell me one thing , " he said in deep and portentous tones . " What ? " Himself-at-forty looked alarmed . Heaven only knew what he thought would come out of Justin 's mouth . Justin leered at turn . - That the Rolling Stones are n't still touring by the time you're-I'm-forty . " " Well , no . " Now his older self looked irked , as if he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Do n't have much fun at forty , do you ? Justin thought . Here came the waitress with the beer She had n't asked either of the Justins for his driver 's license . A good thing , too . Justin wondered what kind of license his older self had , or if himself-at-forty had one at all . But he had more important things to worry about . After the waitress went off to deal with a party of Koreans at another table , Justin said , " Okay , I believe you . I did n't think I would , but I do . You know too much-and you could n't have pulled that quarter out of your ear from nowhere . " He took a big sip of his OB . " That 's right , " himself-at-forty said . Again , he sounded as if he knew everything there was to know . That rubbed Justin the wrong way . But , goddamn it , his older self did know more than Justin . How much more ? Justin did n't know . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank his glass empty , and filled it from the big bottle the waitress had set in front of him . Pretty soon , that second glass was empty , too . Justin killed the bottle pouring it for a third time . He waved to the waitress for another beer . Why not ? His older self was buying . Himself-at-forty had n't even refilled his glass once yet . Terrific , Justin thought . I turn into a wet blanket . Not only did the waitress bring his new beer , but also dinner : plates of strange vegetables ( many of them potently flavored with garlic and chilies ) for Justin and his older self to share and the marinated beef and pork . She started the gas fire under the grill and used a pair of tongs to put some meat on to cook for them . As the thinly sliced strips started sizzling , Justin pointed at them and said , " Oh my God ! They killed Kenny ! " @Huh ? " His older self clearly did n't remember South Park . Wet blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his older self 's eyes . " Oh . " Himself-at-forty laughed-a little . Justin said , " If you 'd have said that to me , I 'd have laughed a lot harder . " He decided to cut his older self some slack : " But the show 's not big for you any more , is it ? No , it would n't be . 2018 . Jesus . " He made a good start on the new OB . His older self grabbed the tongs and took some meat . So did Justin . They both ate with chopsticks . Justin was n't real smooth with them , but he looked down his nose at people who came to Asian restaurants and reached for the knife and fork . They could do that at home . Himself-at-forty handled the chopsticks almost as well as the Koreans a couple of tables over . More practice , Justin thought . After they 'd made a fair dent in dinner , Justin said , " Well , will you tell me what this is all about ? " His older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the most important thing in your life right now ? " Justin grinned . " You mean , besides trying to figure out why I 'd travel back in time to see me ? " Himself-at-forty nodded , his face blank like a poker player 's . Justin went on , " What else could it be but Megan ? " " Okay , we 're on the same page , " himself-at-forty said . " That 's why I 'm here , to set things right with Megan . " " Things with Megan do n't need setting right . " Justin could feel the beer he 'd drunk . It made him sound even surer than he would have otherwise . " Things with Megan are great . I mean , I 'm taking my time and all , but they 're great . And they 'll stay great , too . How many kids do we have now ? " That was the beer talking , too . Without it , he 'd never have spoken-so freely . " None . " Himself-at-forty touched the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None ? " That did n't sound good . The way his older self said the word did n't sound good , either . Justin noticed something he should have seen sooner : " You 're not wearing a wedding ring . " Its older self nodded . He asked , " Does that mean we do n't get married ? " " We get married , all right , " his older self answered grimly " And then we get divorced . " Ice ran through Justin . " That ca n't happen , " he blurted . He knew too goddamn much about divorce , more than he 'd ever wanted to . He knew about the shouts and the screams and the slammed doors . He knew about the silences that were even deadlier He knew about the lies his parents had told each other . He knew about the lies they 'd told him about each other , and the lies they 'd told him about themselves . He had a pretty fair notion of the lies they 'd told themselves about themselves . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course FIl still care for you just as much afterwards as I did before . Megan was n't the only one who envied him his apartment-a lot of people his age did . What the apartment meant to him was that his folks would sooner give him money to look out for himself than bother looking out for him . He envied Megan her parents who cared . And now his older self was saying he and Megan would go through that ? He sure was . His voice hard as stone , he squashed Justin 's protest : " It can . It did , It will , " That muscle at the comer of his jaw started jumping again " But-how ? " Justin asked , sounding even in his own ears like a little boy asking how his puppy could have died . He tried to rally . " We are n't like Mom and Dad-we do n't fight all the time , and we do n't look for something on the side wherever we can find it . " He took a long pull at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his mouth . And he had n't smiled back at that girl in the mall . He really had n't . With weary patience , his older self answered , " You can fight about sex , you can fight about money , you can fight about in-laws . We ended up doing all three , and so . . . " Himself-at-forty leaned his chopsticks on the edge of his plate and spread his hands . " We broke upwill break up-if we do n't change things . That 's why I figured out how to come back : to change things , I mean . " Justin poured the last of the second OB into his glass at gulped it down . After a bit , he said , " You must have wanted to do that a lot . " " You might say so . " His older self drank some more beer , too . He still sounded scratchy as he went on , " Yeah , you just might say so . Since we fell apart , I 've never come close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it 's not her , it 's nobody . That 's how it looks from here , anyhow . I want to make things right for the two of us. @ " Things were going to be right . " But Justin could n't make himself sound as if he believed it . Divorce ? He shuddered . From everything he 'd seen , anything was better than that . In a small voice , he asked , " What will you do ? " " I 'm going to take over your life for the next couple of months . " His older self sounded absolutely sure , as if he 'd thought it all through and this was the only possible answer . Was that how doctors sounded , recommending major surgery ? Justin did n't get a chance to wonder for long ; himself-at-forty plowed ahead , relentless as a landslide : " I 'm going to be you . I 'm going to take Megan out . I 'm going to make sure things are solid-and then the superstring I 've ridden to get me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after . Ill brief you to make sure you do n't screw up what I 've built . And when I get back to 2018 , I will have lived happily ever after . How does that sound ? " " I do n't know . " Now Justin regretted pouring down two tall beers one right after the other . He needed to think dearly , and he could n't quite . " You 'll be taking Megan out ? " " That 's right . " Himself-at-forty nodded . " You 'll be ... taking Megan back to the apartment ? " " Yeah , " his older self said . " But she 'll think it 's you , remember , and pretty soon it 'll be you , and it 'll keep right on being you till you turn into me , if you know what I mean . " " I know what you mean . Still . . . " Justin grimaced . " I do n't know . I do n't like it . " When you imagined your girlfriend being unfaithful to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justin tried to imagine Megan being unfaithful to him by picturing her making love with somebody who looked just like him . It made his mental eyes cross . His older self folded his arms across his chest and sat there in the booth . " You have a better idea ? " he asked . He must have known damn well that Justin had no ideas at all . " It 's not fair , " Justin protested . " You know all this shit , and I 've got ta guess . " With a cold shrug , himself-at-forty said , " If you think I did this to come back and tell you ties , go ahead . That 's fine . You 'll see what happens . And we 'll both be sorry . " " I do n't know . I just do n't know . " Justin shook his head . He felt trapped , caught in a spider 's web . " Everything sounds like it hangs together , but you could be bullshitting , too , just as easy . " " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self could pack into two words . Justin got to his feet , so fast it made him lightheaded for a couple of seconds-or maybe that was the beer , too . " I wo n't say yes and I wo n't say no , not now I wo n't . I 've got your e-mail address . III use it . " Out he went , planting his feet with exaggerated care at every stride . Night had fallen while he and himselfat-forty were eating . He drove back to his apartment building as carefully as he 'd walked . Picking up a 502 for driving under the influence was the last thing he wanted . One thought pounded in his head the whole way back . What do I do ? " at the bell do I do ? He 'd just come out of the bathroomthe revenge of those two tall OBswhen the telephone rang . He wondered if it was his older self , calling to give him another dose of lecture . If it was , he intended to tell himself-at-forty where he could stick that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was n't his older self . " Hiya , " Megan said . " Oh ! " Justin shifted gears in a hurry . . Ffi ! @ " I just called up to say I think you 're the bomb , " she told him , and hung up before he could answer He stared at the telephone handset , then slowly set it back in its cradle . " God damn you , " he whispered , cursing not Megan but his older self . " Oh , God damn you , " He had a girl like this , and himself-at-forty was saying he 'd lose her ? I ca n't do that , he thought . Whatever it takes , -I ca n't do that Even if it means bowing out of your own life for a while ? Even if it means letting him stick his nose in ? But his older self sticking his nose in did n't worry Justin . His older self sticking something else in ... I do n't have to make up my mind right away . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is too important . And if my older self ca n't figure that out , tough shit , that 's an . Justin checked his e-mail even before he brushed his teeth the next morning . Himself-at-forty had n't started nagging , anyhow . There was e-mail from Megan , though . Everything else could wait , but he opened that . It said , The bomb. , - ) He grinned and shook his head . But the grin slipped a moment later . I ca n't let ber get away from me Knowing sbe might ... He ground his teeth . He did n't just know she might . He knew she would . He 'd never thought of being blind to the future as a blessing , but knowing some of it sure felt like a curse . At work , his boss chewed him out for not paying attention to anything going on around him . He could n't even blame the guy ; he was n't paying attention to anything going on around him . Too many important things spun through his mind . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CompUSA , then went to the pay phones around the side of the building . He fed in a quarter-not the one from 2012 ; he was saving that - and a dime and called Megan . " Hello ? " she said . " Hi . I think you 're the bomb , too . " It was n't I low you-it was n't even dose to I love you-but it was the best he could do . Megan giggled , as if she 'd been waiting by the telephone for him to call . " I bet you say that whenever you phone a girl who is n't wearing any clothes , " she answered-and hung up on him again . He spluttered , which did him no good . He reached into his pants pocket for more change to call her back and find out why she was n't wearing any clothes-or if she really was n't wearing any clothes . But that did n't matter . He had the image of her naked stuck in his head-which had to be just what she 'd had in mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his mind . I ca n't lose her No matter what , I ca n't lose her . If that meant letting his older self fix things up-whatever there was that needed fixing-then it did , and that was all there was to it . Despite deciding , he took another day and a half to write the e-mail that admitted he 'd decided . All right , dammit , he typed . I still do n't know about this , but I do n't think I have any choice . If me and Megan are going to break up , that ca n't happen . You better make sure it does n't . After he 'd sent the e-mail , he looked at it again . It was n't exactly gracious . He shrugged . He did n't feel exactly gracious , either . An answer came back almost at once . Himself-at-forty must have been hanging around the computer waiting for him to say something . You wo n't be sorry , the e-mail told him . Whatever , Justin wrote . His hands balled into fists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the switch ? Meet me in front of the R Dalton 's again , himself-at-forty replied . Park by the Sears . I will , too . Bring whatever you want in your car You can move it to the one I 'm driving . I 'll do the same here . See you in two hours ? Justin sighed . Whatever , he said again . Packing did n't take anything like two hours . He thought about bringing the iMac along , but ended up leaving it behind and taking his PowerBook instead . It was old , but it would do for games and for the Net . He scribbled a note and set it by the iMac 's keyboard : In case you do n't remember , here 's Megan 's phone number and e-mail . Do n't screw it up , that 's all I 've got to fell you . Once he 'd stuffed everything he thought he needed into a pair of suitcases , he put them in the trunk of his Toyota and headed for the mail . He 'd gone only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung down to the Home Depot on Roscoe first . Even with the stop , he still took his place in front of the bookstore before his older self got there . This time , seeing himself-at-forty made him grim , not boggled . " Let 's get this over with , " he said . " Come on . It 's not a root canal , " his older self said . Justin shrugged . He 'd never had one . Himself-at-forty went on , " Let 's go do it . We 'll need to swap keys , you know . " " Yeah , " Justin said . " I had spares made . How about you ? " " Me , too . " His older self grinned a lopsided grin . " We think alike . Amazing , huh ? " " Amazing . Right . " Justin abruptly turned away and started walking toward Sears and the lot beyond it . - This better work . " - It will . - Himself-at-forty sounded disgustingly confident . The two Toyotas sat only a couple of rows apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his older self . Justin moved his things into the other car , while himself-at-forty put stuff in his . They traded keys . " You know where I live , " Justin said . " What 's my new address ? " " Oh . " His older self gave it to him . He knew where it was-not as good a neighborhood as the one the Acapulco was in . Himself-at-forty went on , " The car 's insured , and you 'll find plenty of money in the underwear drawer . " His older self patted him on the shoulder , the only time they 'd touched other than shaking hands . " It 'll be fine . Honest . You 're on vacation for a couple of months , that 's all . " " On vacation from my life , " Justin exclaimed . He glared at his older self . " Do n't fuck up , that 's all . " " It 's my life , too , remember . " Himselfat-forty got into the car Justin had driven to the mall . Justin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering if this were some elaborate scam , he tried the key . The car started right up . Justin drove off to see where the hell he 'd have to wait this out . Sure enough , the Yachtsman and the apartment buildings on the block with it were older and tireder-looking than the Acapulco and its surroundings . It was n't a neighborhood where guys sold crack from parked cars , but it might be heading that way in a few years . The one bright spot Justin saw was the Denny 's on the corner . If he got sick of frozen dinners and his own bad cooking , he could always eat there . He found his parking space under the apartment building . When he went out to the lobby , a mailbox had KLOSTER Dymo-taped onto it . He checked . His older self had n't got any mail . Justin went inside and found his apartment . The door key and dead-bolt key both worked . " Well , what have we got ? " he wondered . When he discovered what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The TV just plugged into the wall : no cable , not even a VCR hooked up . The stereo had to have come out of an antique store . It played cassettes and vinyl , but not CDs . He could play CDs on the PowerBook , but even so ... He opened the underwear drawer , more than half expecting BVI ) s and nothing else . But under the briefs lay ... " Christ ! " he exclaimed . How much was there ? He picked up wad after wad of cash , threw them all down on the bed , and started counting . By the time he was through , he 'd had almost as much fun as he 'd ever had in his life . Close to seventy grand , he thought dazedly . Jesus . All at once , he stopped doubting his older self 's story . Nobody-but nobody-would spend , or let him spend , that kind of money on a scam . The bills were n't even crisp and new , as they might have been if they were counterfeits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and could n't be anything but genuine . " Okay , " he said , fighting the impulse to count them again . " I 'm on vacation . Let the good times roll . " He did recount a couple of thousand dollars " worth , just for the bell of it . He 'd never been in a spot where he could spend all the money he wanted , do whatever he felt like doing . If he wanted to go out and get a VCR , he could - and he intended to . He could charge right down to Circuit City or Best Buy or Fry 's and ... " Uh-oh , " he muttered . If he went to any of those places , there was some chance he 'd run into Megan . His older self did n't want him running into Megan for a while , and his older self had left him all this money to play around with so he would n't . He shrugged . He could go over to Burbank or out to Simi Valley or wherever and get a VCR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent enough tapes to keep him from getting too ... Uh-oh . He did n't say it this time , but he thought it . Megan was liable to show up at either of the local Blockbusters ; she liked watching movies on video as much as everybody else did . " Okay , " Justin said , as if somebody were arguing with him . " I 'll find some video place out in the boonies , too . " That made him happier He had time to kill-nothing but time to kill-and movies were a great way to kill it . But he could n't watch movies and play computer games all the damn time . I ran go down to ... But that thought stopped before it was even half formed . He could n't go to the mall , not to Northridge , not to Topanga Plaza , not even to the half-dead Promenade farther down Topanga or to tacky Fallbrook . Megan visited all of them . " Shit , " he said in a low voice . And he really could n't go to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking Megan ? To one of them or another , sure as hell . What would she think if she were with his older self and then saw him come in by himself in different clothes ? Nothing good , that was for damn sure . Great , Justin thought . I can do whatever I want , as long as I do n't do it in any of the places I usually go to . Or I can just sit here in this miserable apartment and jack off . He suspected he 'd end up doing a lot of that . Thinking about Megan immediately made him want to do more than think about Megan : he was , after all , twenty-one . Down , boy , he told himself . Himself did n't want to listen , While he was holed up here by his lonesome , himselfat-forty would be taking Megan out , taking Megan home , taking Megan to bed . No , he did n't like that worth a rat 's ass . He tried again to imagine Megan being unfaithful to him with somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succeeding this time . He paced out to the kitchen . Even looking at the bed turned him on and pissed him off , regardless of whether it had cash strewn all over it . When he opened the refrigerator , he found a cou pie of six-packs of microbrews along with fresh vegetables and other things he was unlikely to eat . He tried to unscrew the cap from one of the beers , only to discover it did n't unscrew . That meant he had to rummage in the drawer till he came up with an opener Once he got the cap off , he threw it at the wastebasket-and missed . He had to bend down and drop it in-and even then he almost missed again . Sighing , Justin sipped the hard-won Anchor Porter ... and made a horrible face . " People pay a buck a bottle for this ? " he said . " Jesus ! Gim me Coors light any day " When he opened the freezer , he found steaks and chops and chicken in there . He supposed he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but chicken was out of his culinary league . Fortunately , there were also several frozen dinners . He did n't know what he would have done if his older self had turned into a total foodie . Like bell I do n't know , he thought , and grinned . I 'd just eat out all the time . With that Denny 's right at the end of the block , I might anyway . After watching network TV that night , he realized he would have to get a VCR ASAP if he wanted to stay anywhere close to sane . He ate bacon and eggs and hash browns at the Denny 's the next morning , then drove over to an electronics place he knew on Ventura Boulevard in Encino-only twenty minutes " drive from the Yachtsman , but not a place where he was at all likely to run into Megan . He bought the VCR , put the box in his trunk , and headed to a Blockbuster a few doors away to get some tapes . His address came up on their computer system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , sir ? " the clerk said . " Yeah . " Justin nodded . " This is near where I work . " He 'd never been a great har . He was , at the moment , wearing a Dilbert T-shirt and a pair of baggy shorts . The clerk raised an eyebrow . But Justin 's credit checked out okay , so that was all she did . Having lugged the VCR into his apartment , he discovered , not for the first time , that being a computer-science major did n't make the damn thing easy to set up . He fumed and mumbled and cussed and finally got the gadget acting the way it was supposed to . With Deep Impact on the TV and a Coke in his hand , life looked better . He put his feet on the coffee table and belched enormously Nothing to do but kick back and watch movies for a couple of months ? Okay , I can handle it , he thought . Then he snapped his fingers . " Potato chips ! " he said out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went fine . The next day went all right . By the middle of the afternoon on the third day , he was sick of movies and computer games and hoped he 'd never see another nacho-cheese Dorito as long as he lived . He went into the bedroom and picked up the phone . He 'd dialed four digits of Megan 's number before he remembered he was n't supposed to call her . " God damn it , " he muttered . " This is so lame . What am I going to do , stay cooped up here tiff I get all dusty ? " His older self wanted him to do exactly that . His older self had left him plenty of money so he would do exactly that . But what good was the money if he had trouble finding places to blow it ? After staring at the walls-and the TV screen , and his laptop 's monitor-for two days straight , his affection for his older self , which had never been high , sank like the Dow on an especially scary day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness . Now maybe he did . He wanted to talk with his girlfriend . Hell , he wanted to lay his girlfriend . Himself-at-forty was telling him he could n't do either . Himself-at-forty , the son of a bitch , was probably doing both . Justin was no better at handling frustration than anyone else his age . The homier he got , the worse he got , too . If he could n't talk to Megan , he damn well could talk to his older self . He dialed the number at his apartment , which felt funny . He never called there . Why would he ? If he was n't home , who would answer ? A burglar ? But somebody was home to answer now . And , after three rings , somebody did . " Hello ? " Himself-at-forty sounded as if he were talking from deep underwater . " Hi , " Justin said cheerfully ; he had all he could do not to say hiya , the way Megan did . " How are things ? " " Things are fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He still sounded like bell ; if he had n't been ridden hard and put away wet , Justin had never heard anybody who had . Another pause . Then himself-at-forty tried again : " Or they were till you called . I was asleep . " " Now ? " Justin exclaimed in disbelief . He looked at his watch : half past two . He did n't think he 'd been asleep at half past two since he was three years old and quit taking naps . " I called now " cause I figured you would n't be . " " Never mind . " His older self yawned , but seemed a little less fuzzy when he went on , " Yeah , things are okay . We went to the Probe last night , and- " " Did you ? " Justin broke in . He did n't like the way that sounded : him stuck here in this miserable place , himself-atforty having a good time at his favorite club . No , he did n't like that at all . " What else did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his older self answered . " Some guy came through with fliers , so I knew how to get there . " Yeah , you 'd have forgotten , would n't you , you sorry bastard ? Aloud , Justin said , " Lucky you . And what else did you do ? " He could imagine Megan in his older self 's arms , all right . Now he could . He 'd had plenty of time to try . Practice made perfect , dammit . He could hate what he imagined , too . " About what you 'd expect , " himselfat-forty said . Christ , he sounded arrogant . " I 'm you , remember . What would you have done ? " Justin sighed . He knew what he would have done , by God . But no . He 'd stayed here by his lonesomeby his very lonesome-so his older self could do it instead . He sucked in a long , angry breath preparatory to telling himself-at-forty where to head in . Before he could , his older self went on , " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved her . " " Jesus ! " Justin yelped , forgetting whatever else he might have said . " What did you go and do that for ? " " It 's true , is n't it ? " his older self asked . " That does n't mean you 've got to say it , for Christ 's sake , " Justin answered . He shook his head in disbelief , though his older self was n't there to see it . His parents must have said they loved each odier once upon a time , too , and how had that turned out ? " What am I suppose to do when you go away ? " " Marry her , doofus , " himself-at-forty said , as if it were just that simple . " live happily ever after , so I get to live happily ever after , too . Why the hell do you think I came back here ? " " For your good time , man , not mine , " Justin snarled . " I 'm sure not having a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No surprise-how many Cokes had he poured down since he got to this place ? Too many . With the carbonation , he tasted stale nacho cheese . His older self took a deep breath , too , and said , " Look , chill for a while , okay ? I 'm doing fine . " That only made Justin angrier . " Sure you are . You 're doing fucking great . What about me ? " " You 're fine . Chill . You 're on vacation , " himself-at-forty answered . if he did n't know everything , he did n't know he did n't know everything . " Go ahead . Relax . Spend my money . That 's what it 's there for . " When his older self mentioned the money , Justin forgot how chuffed he was , at least for a little while . " Where 'd you get so much ? " he asked . " What did you do , rob a bank ? " " It 's worth a lot more now then it will be then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have some fun . just be discreet , okay ? " Which brought Justin back to square one . His older self kept trying to blow him off , and he did n't want to put up with it . " You mean , get out of your hair " " In a word , yes . " Himself-at-forty sounded as if he was having trouble putting up with Justin , too " While you 're in Megan 's hair . " No , Justin had no trouble at all seeing pictures in his mind , pictures nastier than any he could have pulled off the Net . He sighed , trying to make them go away . " I do n't know , dude . " " It 's for you , " himself-at- forty said . " It 's for her and you . " That , goddammit , was the trump card . If Justin-now was fated to break up with Megan , he did n't see that he had any choice other than letting his older self set things right . He hated the idea . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it more . But he could n't find any way around it . Get married and get divorced ? That was worse . " Yeah , " he said , and hung up . Every minute he spent in that miserable apartment ... from then on , he spent as little time as he could there . That worked better than staring at the TV and the PowerBook 's monitor and , most of all , the four walls . When he was out and doing things , he did n't think about himself-at-forty and Megan ... so much . Getting out would have worked better still if he 'd been able to go to the places he really liked , the local malls and the movie theaters and coffeehouses and restaurants where he 'd gone with Megan . But he did n't dare , He could n't imagine what he 'd do if he saw her and his older self together And what would himself-at-forty do ? And Megan ? Those were all terrific questions , and he did n't want to find out the answers to any of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure he would n't run into Megan or anybody else he knew . He killed an afternoon at the Glendale Galleria . He killed a whole day at the enormous Del Amo mall down in Torrance , which was supposed to be the biggest shopping center this side of the Mall of America . By the time he 'd trekked from one end of it to the other , he believed all the hype . He had n't come close to hitting all the stores that looked interesting . He grabbed some pizza down there , and stayed for a movie after the shops closed . That turned out to be a mistake . Sitting in a theater by himself was the loneliest thing he 'd ever done , much worse than watching a movie on the Wa without any company . All the other people there seemed to have somebody else to have a good time with , and he did n't . And he was sure Megan would have loved this flick . She 'd have gone all slobbery over the male star , and he could have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have told him he only went to movies for the special effectsand they were pretty damn special . And then they would have gone back to his place and screwed themselves silly . He went back to the place that was n't his : a long haul up the San Diego Freeway , which had plenty of traffic even after eleven at night . When he got there , he masturbated twice in quick succession . It was n't the same-it was n't close to the same-but it let him fall asleep . The next morning , he drove out Topanga Canyon Boulevard to the ocean and spent the day at Zuma Beach . That would have been better with Megan along , too , but it was n't so bad by itself , either : nothing to do but lie there and watch girls and keep himself well greased with sunscreen . It let him get through another day without being too unhappy . But , in spite of all the sunscreen , he came home with a burn . He was so fair , he could sunburn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall asleep . Finally , he quit trying- He put on some shorts and a T-shirt and went out front to watch TV That experiment did n't last long : nothing there but crap of the purest ray serene . After about twenty minutes , he turned it off in disgust . " Now what ? " he muttered . He still was n't sleepy . He walked back into the bedroom and got his car keys . He was an L.A. kid , all right : when in doubt , climb behind the wheel . Driving around with a Pulp cassette in the stereo and the volume cranked made Justin feel better for a while . But he was n't just driving around . His hands and feet figured that out a little before his head did . The conscious part of his mind was surprised to discover they 'd sent him down his own street toward his own apartment building . If he parked between the Acapulco and the building next to it , he could look between them and see his bedroom window , a foreshortened rectangle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all he could see , light and , briefly , a moving shadow . Was that his older self ? Megan ? Were they both there ? If they were , what were they doing ? Like I do n't know , Justin thought . " I 've got spare keys , " he told himself in conversational tones . " I could walk in there and ... " Instead , he started up the car and drove away@ fast . What would he do if he did walk in on himself-at-forty and Megan ? He did n't want to find out . The sunburn bothered him enough the next day that staying in the apartment and being a lump suited him fine . The day after , though , he felt better , which meant he also started feeling stir crazy . He went out and drove some more : west on the 118 into Ventura County Sum Valley and Moorpark were bedroom communities for the Valley , the way the Valley had been a bedroom community for downtown L.A. when his parents were his age . I could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he put the pedal to the metal to get on the freeway , and I 'm going to Simi Valley ? But , in fact , he could n't go to Paris or Prague or Tokyo , not without a passport , which he did n't have . And he did n't really want to . He just wanted to go on living the way he had been living . He 'd spent his whole life in the Valley , and was in some ways as much a small-town kid as somebody from Kokomo or Oshkosh . Justin did n't think of himself like that , of course . As far as he was concerned , he stood at the top of the cool food chain . And so , when he 'd pulled off the freeway and driven the couple of blocks to what his Thomas Brothers guide showed as the biggest shopping center in Simi Valley , he made gagging noises . " It 's not even a mall ! " he exclaimed . And it was n't , not by his standards : no single , enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to go from . store to store , he had to expose his tender hide to the sun for two , sometimes three , minutes at a time . He almost turned around and drove back to his apartment . In the end , with a martyred sigh , he parked the car and headed toward a little mom-and-pop software store . It turned out to be all PC stuff . He had Virtual PC , so he could run Windows programs on his Macs , but he left in a hurry anyway . They 'd go okay on the iMac , which was a pretty fast machine , but they 'd be glacial on the old PowerBook he had with him . The Wherehouse a couple of doors down was just as depressing . Grunge , metal , rap , bands his parents had listened to-yeah , they had plenty of that stuff . British pop ? He found one , count it , one Oasis CD , filed under THE REST OF " 0 . " Past that ? Nada . " Boy , this is fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high dudgeon . He spotted a Borders halfway across the shopping center and headed toward it . Even as he did , he wondered why he bothered . The way his luck was running , it would stock a fine assortment of computer magazines from 1988 . Behind him , somebody called , " Justin ! - He kept walking . Half the guys in his generation-all the ones who were n't Jasons-were justins . But the call came again , louder , more insistent : . Hey , Justin ! " Maybe it is me , he thought , and turned around . A startled smile spread over his face . " Lindsey ! " he said . Sure as hell , Lindsey Fletcher came running up to him , rubber-soled sandals scuffing on the sidewalk . He opened his arms . They gave each other a big hug . " I ca n't believe it , " Lindsey said . " What are you doing up here ? You never come up here . I 've never seen you up here , anyway . " She spoke as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , Justin remembered . He remembered the mole on the side of her neck , too . it was still there , a couple of inches above the top of her T-shirt . " How are you ? " he said . " How 've you been ? " " I 'm fine . " She looked him up and down . " God , you have n't changed a bit . " " Yeah , well , " Justin said , a little uncomfortably . He knew how little he would change , too , which she did n't . " What are you doing up here ? " Lindsey asked again . " Whatever , " Justin answered . " A little shopping . Hanging out . You know . " " Here ? It 's a lot better in the Valley . " She looked astonished and sounded wistful . " Yeah , well , " he said again : he 'd already discovered that . " Something new . " " Slumming , " Lindsey told him . " But as long as you 're here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She pointed . " I mean , if you want to get something and , you know , talk for a little while . " " Sure , " Justin said . like a lot of the little donut shops in Southern California , this one was run by Cambodians : a middle-aged couple who spoke with accents and a teenage boy who talked just like Justin and Lindsey Lindsey tried to buy ; Justin would n't let her , not with his older self 's money burning a hole in his wallet . They got jelly donuts and big fizzy Cokes , sat down at one of the halfdozen or so little tables in the shop , and proceeded to get powdered sugar all over their faces . " What have you been up to ? " Lindsey asked , dabbing at herself with a paper napkin . " Finished my junior year at CSUN , " Justin answered , pronouncing it C-sun the way anybody who went there would . " What 's your major ? " " Computer science . It 's pretty interesting , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job at the Northridge CompUSA . " Which my older self is welcome to . Half a beat slower than he should have , Justin asked , " How about you ? " " I 've been going to Moorpark Community College kind of on and off , " Lindsey said . " I 've got a part-time job , toopet grooming . " " Ah , cool , " Justin said . " You always did love animals . I remember . " She nodded . " Maybe III end up doing that full-time . If I can save some money , maybe I 'll try and get into breeding one of these days . " She sipped at her Coke , then asked , " Do I want to know about your parents ? " " No ! " Justin exclaimed . " God no ! Let 's see ... I think you 'd already moved here when my mom came out of the closet . " " Oh , Lord . " Lindsey 's eyes got big . " That must have been fun . " " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me quick if I ever set out to discover myself . " He turned his mother 's favorite phrase into a curse . Lindsey did n't ask about his father . The bad news there had been obvious while she still lived in the Valley . After some hesitation , she did ask , " What about you ? Are you ... seeing anybody ? " Justin had just taken a big bite of jelly donut , so he did n't have to answer right away . When he did , he did his best to make it sound casual : " Uh-huh . " " Oh . " Lindsey looked disappointed , which was flattering . And Justin could n't have sounded too casual , because she asked , " Are you serious ? " " Well , it kinda looks that way , " he admitted . And then , not so much out of politeness as because he did n't want to think about how he was n't seeing Megan right this minute and his older self was , he said , " What about you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond hair-she 'd worn it longer in high school-fell down onto her nose . She brushed it away with her hand . " Not right now . Not so it matters , anyhow , I mean . I 've gone with a few guys since I got up here , but nobody I 'd want to settle down with . You 're lucky . " She sounded wistful again . She also sounded as if she really meant it . She 'd never begrudged happiness to anybody else . Justin would have had trouble saying the same thing-he was mad as hell thinking about himself at forty having a good time with Megan . And how lucky was he if his older self had to come back from 2018 to try to straighten things out ? But Lindsey didn't-couldn'tknow about that@ of course . He finished the donut in a couple of big bites . " I better get going . I have to be at work before too long . " He could almost feel his nose getting longer , but the he gave him an excuse to get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was great to see you . I 'm glad you 're doing so well . " She sounded as if she really meant that , too . Nope , not a mean bone in her body . She gave him another hug , this one a little more constrained than the one when they first ran into each other " Listen , if you ever want to just talk or anything , I 'm in the book . " She made a fAce . " I sorta wish I was n't , but I am . I get more darrin telemarketers than you can shake a stick at . " " Always at dinnertime , too , " Justin said , and she nodded . " They ought to do something about " em . " He did n't know who they were or what they could do , but that did n't stop him from complain ing . He headed for the door . " So long . " " So long , Justin . " Lindsey followed , but more slowly , making it plain she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . He headed for his car . Lindsey walked in the direction of the Wherehouse he 'd already found wanting . He looked back toward her once . She was looking toward him . They both smiled and waved . Justin pulled out his keys , unlocked the Toyota , and slid inside . Lindsey went into the Wherehouse . Justin drove back to the Valley . For some reason he could n't quite fathom , he did n't feel so bad once he got there . He kept feeling halfway decent , or even a little better than halfway decent , for a while afterwards . The driving need to call up either his older self or Megan and find out how things were going went away . What that amounted to , of course , was finding out whether anybody in the whole wide world cared if he was alive-and a good-sized fear the answer was no . Lindsey Fletcher cared . Justin did n't think of it in those termson a conscious level , he hardly thought of it at all-but that was what it added UP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , he found things to do and places to go that let him kill time without seeming to be doing nothing but killing time . He drove over to the Sherman Oaks Galleria , which had gone from the coolest place in the world to semi-ghost town in one fell swoop after the " 94 quake . He beat the parking hassles at the new Getty Museum looming over the San Diego Freeway by taking a cab there-spending my older self 's money , he thought , feeling half virtuous and half so them ! He found a pretty good Japanese restaurant , Omino 's , on Devonshire near Canoga . It 'd be a good place to take Megan once himself-at-forty got the hell back to 2018 where he belonged . Superstrings , Justin muttered in the apartment that was n't his . He 'd fought his way through his physics classes ; he could n't say much more than that . He wished he knew more . His older self did , dammit . That was definitely something to think about when he planned his schedule for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he started muttering other , more incendiary , things . His decent mood did n't last , not least because he did n't fully understand what had caused it in the first place . The apartment in the Yachtsman started feeling like a prison cell again . Going out stopped being fun . Minutes crawled past on hands and knees . Justin thought about calling his older self to complain : he thought about it for a good second and a half , as a matter of fact . Then he laughed a bitter laugh that lasted a lot longer . He knew just what his older self would say . Live with it . He could tell himself that and save the price of a phone call . It was n't quite fuck off and die , but close enough for government work . Besides , he did n't really want to talk to himself-at-forty . He wanted to talk to Megan . His older self had given him all sorts of reasons why that was n't a good idea . Justin had only one reason why it was : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Eventually , that swamped everything his older self had said . He felt as if he 'd just pulled off a jailbreak when he dialed her number . Her father answered the phone . " Hi , Mr. Tricoupis , " he said happily . " Can I talk to Megan , please ? " Instead of saying Sure or Hang on a second or anything like that , Megan 's father answered , " Well , I do n't know , Justin . I 'll see if she wants to talk to you . I 'll see if she wants to talk to you ? Justin thought . What the bell 's going on here ? But he could n't even ask , because a clunking noise meant Mr. Tricoupis had put the phone down . He could only wait . After what seemed like forever but could n't have been more than half a minute , Megan said , " Hello ? " He needed no more than the one word to hear that she did n't sound happy . But he felt something close to delirious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he burbled . " How you doing ? " Another pause . Then , very carefully , Megan said , " Justin , did n't I tell you last night not to call here for a while ? Did n't I say that ? " He knew what that meant . It meant his older self was n't as goddamn smart as he thought he was . By the look of things , it also meant he 'd have to bail himself-at-forty out instead of the other way round . He wondered if he could . He and Megan had n't had any great big fights , which meant he had no sure feel for how to fix one . Silly seemed a good idea . " Duh , " he said , the standard idiot-noise of the late " 90s , and then , " My big mouth . " That was n't just an apology ; it was also the tide of an Oasis song Megan liked . " Your big mouth is right , " she said , but a little of the hard edge left her voice-either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was n't going to let him down easy , though- , she went on , " Do you have any idea how far over the line you were ? Any idea at all ? " " Definitely maybe , - he answered : an Oasis album title that had the added virtue of keeping him off the hook . He was n't sure Megan had noticed the first title he used , but she definitely noticed the second ; he heard her snort . " You 're funny now , " she said , as if fighting to stay mad . " You were n't funny last night after the movie , believe me you were n't . " Which movie ? Justin wondered . He could hardly ask ; he was supposed to know He could n't even waste any more time cursing his older self , not when he was trying to jolly Megan back into a good mood . " Charmless man , that 's me , " he said . It was n't just him-it was also a track on a recent Blur CD . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter now . " What am I supposed to do about you ? " " Roll with it , my legendary girlfiend , " Justin said : one Oasis song , one from Pulp . " I 'm just a killer for your love . Advert . " Two from Blur . He did n't know how long he could keep it up , but he was having fun while it lasted . With that , Megan gave up the fight and giggled . " Okay , " she said . " Okay . I did n't think you could do anything to make me forget last night , but you did . How did you manage ? " " Only tongue will tell , " he answered gravely . " Worked a miracle . " That set Megan off again- She recognized Trash Can Sinatras titles , sure enough , and there probably were n't three other people in the San Fernando Valley who would have . " I 'll see you soon , Justin , " she said , and hung up But she would n't be seeing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Justin started to call his old apartment to tell himself-at-forty what he thought of him , but held off . He did n't see what good it would do . He was n't quite ready to throw his older self out of his place on his ear , and nothing short of that would make a nickel 's worth of difference . I 'll wait , he thought . For a little while . He did n't have to wait long . Twenty minutes later , the phone rang . He hurried into the bedroom from the kitchen , hoping it was Megan . He 'd just picked up the phone when he remembered she did n't have the number here . By then , he was already saying , " Hello ? " " Oh , good . You 're home . " His older self sounded half-disappointed Justin had n't walked in front of a truck . " Oh , it 's you , " Justin answered , still wishing it were Megan . Throwing himself-at-forty out on his ear suddenly looked more attractive . He went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck here . " He looked around the little bedroom , feeling like a trapped animal again . His older self had gone into dictator mode : " Did n't I tell you to lay low till I was done here ? God damn it , you 'd better listen to me . I just had to pretend I knew what Megan was talking about when she said I 'd been on the phone with her . " " She 's my girl , too , " Justin said . " She was my girl first , you know . I 've got a right to talk with her . " As talking Lindsey Fletcher out in the wilds of Simi Valley had , it reminded him he was alive . But himself-at-forty did n't want to hear any of that . Maybe he was n't a dictator , maybe he was just a grownup talking down to a kid . Whatever he was , he sure sounded like somebody convinced he knew it all : " Not if you want her to keep being your girl , you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up , remember ? " " That 's what you keep telling me . " Justin was getting sick of hearing it , too . " But you know what ? I 'm not so sure I believe you any more . When I called her , Megan sounded like she was really torqued at me-at you , I mean . So it does n't sound like you 've got all the answers . I " Nobody has all the answers . " His older self sounded as if he believed that . Justin did n't ; like The X-Files , he was convinced the truth was out there , provided he could find it . And then , throwing gasoline on the fire , his older self added , " If you think you 've got more of them than I do , you 're full of shit . " That did it . Justin wanted to turn his head real fast to see if he had smoke coming out of his ears . " You want to be careful how you talk to me , " he ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , I still think your whole setup is bogus . If I decide to , I can wreck it . You know damn well I can . " If that did n't scare the crap out of himself-at-forty , Justin did n't know what would . But if it did , his older self did n't show it , damn him- Instead , he kicked back with both feet , like a mule : " Yeah , go ahead . Screw up your life for good . Keep going like this and you will . " And that scared the crap out of Justin . Himself-at-forty had to know it would . it was the only weapon he had , but it was a nuke . Justin tried not to let on that he knew it , saying , " You sound pretty screwed up now . What have I got to lose ? " Maybe , for once , he got through to himself-at-forty , because his older self , also for once , stopped trying to browbeat him and started trying to explain : " I had something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You wreck what I 'm doing now , you 'll go through life without knowing what a good thing was . " And then he trotted out the ICBMs again . " You want that ? just keep sticking your nose in where it does n't belong . You want to end up with Megan or not ? " There it was . Justin did want that . He wanted it more than anything else in the world , and he could n't let on that he did n't . If himself-at-forty was bluffing , he 'd just got away with it . " All right , " Justin said , though it was anything but all right , and he did n't think he sounded as if it were . " I 'll back off-for now . " He got the last word by hanging up . Then he masturbated again . It made him feet good , but it did n't come close to making him feel better . He rented Titanic and watched it several times over the next few days , which certainly went a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't watching it for the romance . Christ , no . Jack died . He wanted his life with Megan to go on and on , even if he could n't stand Celine Dion . What he watched obsessively was the way the enormous liner took on water and sank after it hit the iceberg . Here in this apartment that was n't his , as far out of the loop as he could be , he felt he was taking on water , too . Running into lindsey Fletcher , sitting down with her , and eating messy jelly donuts and talking had let him believe for quite a while that he was n't alone in the world . He cared about Megan a lot more , but talking with her on the phone did n't satisfy his people jones nearly as long . For one thing , talking on the phone was like looking at a picture of a great dinner-pretty , yeah , but not the real thing . And , for another , he 'd had the row with himself-at-forty just afterwards . He might have stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only reason-he 'd gone along with his older self and this whole craziness was that he could n't stand the idea of losing Megan , of having to go through a divorce . If his older self could smooth things out now , make sure that never happened , great . But if his older self was fighting with Megan , was making her angry at him ... Where the hell did that leave Justin ? He 'd already saved the day once , which made him want to gallop back into the scene like a knight in shining armor coming to rescue the fair maiden . Would he rescue her , though ? Or would he gallop in and screw things up , the way his older self said ? He did n't hop into his car-which was actually his older self 's car-and drive over and throw himself-at-forty out of his rightful apartment . But he could n't stand staying here and doing nothing , either , not for very long he could n't . After a bit more sitting on his hands , he hit on a compromise-or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excuse for doing what he wanted to do anyhow rU call Megan , Justin thought . I did some good the last time . Maybe I can do some more now . And then I 'M brief my older self on what we talked about , so he does n't get caught short . Man is the rationalizing animal . Justin felt good , felt alive , felt part of things again , as he dialed the phone . It rang a couple of times , then somebody picked it up . " Hello ? " Hearing Megan 's voice made him smile big and wide . It also made him horny as hell . " Hiya ! " He gave her back her own favorite greeting . Silence , about fifteen seconds " worth , on the other end of the line . Then Megan said , " Justin , this is way over , I mean way over , the top . Did n't I tell you not two hours ago that I did n't want to see you anymore , I did n't want to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with you anymore ? Did n't P " " But- " Justin heard the words , but he had a hard time making them mean anything . Megan did n't give him much of a chance , either . She went on , " Did n't I tell you that if I ever changed my mind , I 'd call you ? Did n't P I do n't want to be on the phone with you any more , Justin , I mean I really do n't . " She sounded furious , bigtime furious . " Wait a minute , " Justin said frantically . " What- ? " He was trying to say , What are you talking about ? but he never got the chance . Megan filled in the blank for him : " What about the sex ? I already told you , I do n't care how good it was . I do n't care that it got better the last couple weeks , either . I do n't want you treating me like I 'm twelve years old , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goddammit . Goodbye ! " The phone crashed down . Slowly , like a man in shock-which he was-Justin hung up , too . I do n't care that it got better the last couple weeks , either ? One day , when he had time to think about it , that would be a separate torment of its own . Right now , it was just part of the general disaster " What do I do ? " he asked , as if the bedroom could tell him . What he wanted to do was call Megan back and explain , really explain , but that was n't gon na fly . If he got in even two words before she hung up on him , itd be a miracle . " E-mail ! " he exclaimed , and ran for his PowerBook . He wrote the message . He sent it . Less than a minute later , it came back , with PERMANENT FATAL ERROR at the top and an explanatory paragraph underneath saying that she was refusing all mail from his address . " Jesus ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been bozo-filtered ! " That added insult to injury , and none of this , not one single thing , was his fault . He knew whose fault it was , though . Anguish did n't last . Rage replaced it . The phone rang four times before his older self answered . " Hello ? " He sounded groggy . Justin did n't much care how he sounded . " You son of a bitch , " he snarled . " You goddamn stupid , stinking , know-it-all. son of a bitch . " " I 'm sorry , " himself-at-forty said . Of all the useless words in the world right now , those were the big two . " I tried to " I just tried calling Megan , " Justin said , interrupting his older self the way Megan had interrupted him . " She said she did n't want to talk to me . She said she never wanted to talk to me again . She said she 'd told me she never wanted to talk to me again , so what was I doing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hung up on me . " He did n't say anything about the refused email . Somehow , that hurt even worse , too much to talk about . " I 'm sorry , " his older self said again " I- " Sorry ? " Justin yelled . If he had n't had a buzz cut , he might have pulled his hair . " You think you 're sorry now ? You do n't know what sorry is , but you will . I 'm gon na beat the living shit out of you , dude . You think you can get away with that , you 're full of- " He hung up on himself at-forty even harder than Megan had hung up on him . He had n't been in a fight since middle school , and he 'd lost that one . It did n't matter . He stormed out of the apartment , slamming the door behind him . He ran down to his car-no , to his older self 's car-and headed to his old apartment , his proper apartment , as fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fifteen minutes . He was still incandescent when he got there . He turned the key in the lock to the security gate and drove into the Acapulco 's parking lot . His own car , the one himself-at-forty had been driving , was still in its space . " You thought I was kidding , did you , you bastard ? " Justin 's lips skinned back from his teeth in a savage smile . " I 'll show you who was kidding , asshole . " Finding a parking space out on the street took another minute ( a welltrained Southern Californian , he never thought to use one of the empty ones in the parking garage ; those were n't his ) . Then he stormed up the steps into the lobby , opened the security door , and charged toward his apartment . Click ! One key in the dead bolt . Clock ! The other in the lock . The door opened . Justin slammed it shut behind him . " All right , you fucker , now you 're gon na get it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bedroom . It was as empty of lifeexcept his own-as the front room and kitchen had been . He checked the bathroom . He checked the closets . He checked under the bed . He did n't take long to decide he was the only one in the place . But his older self had n't taken his car . " He ca n't have gone far , " Justin muttered : again , the Southern California assumption that nobody without wheels could do much , Justin scratched his head . Was himself-at-forty running for his life ? Hopping a cab ? Waiting for a bus ? None of those made much sense . But the chair in the bedroom was pulled a long way out from the desk . You could n't use the iMac with the chair out there . You could sure as hell use a laptop , though . What would a laptop from 2018 be able to do ? Justin did n't know , but the mere thought was plenty to make him salivate . His older self had said coming back from then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a machine like that , if he had the program on the hard drive , could he go back the way he 'd come ? " How should I know ? " Justin asked nobody in particular . But the apartment felt very , very empty . Maybe his older self had fled where he could n't hope to follow for nineteen years . Or could he ? He knew some things he would n't have if his older self had n't come back and ... And screwed up my life , Justin thought . He knew going back in time involved superstrings and programming . The combination would n't have crossed his mind in a million years-no , in something close to nineteen years-if himself-at-forty had n't returned to 1999 to meddle . And he knew the thing could be done in the first place . Knowing that was half the battle , maybe more than half . He 'd never let himself get discouraged . No matter how bleak things looked , he would n't give up and decide he was chasing something impossible And ... A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nest egg now that he had n't had before , thanks to the cash his older self had left behind . He had n't blown very much of it . If he made some investments and they worked out , he could be sitting pretty by the time he got to the frontiers of middle age . " Inflation , " he said , reminding himself . " Got ta watch out for inflation . " Himself-at-forty had said his stash of cash would n't be worth nearly so much in 2018 as it was now . Whatever he put the money into , he 'd have to make sure rising prices did n't erode it into chump change What he had to do right now was get his hands on the cash , which was still sitting back at the other apartment . Then he 'd have to figure out how to put it into his bank account without getting busted as a drug runner or money launderer . You could put only so much cash in at a time , or else the bank had to report you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper limit ? He had no idea . I 'll find out on the Net , he thought , and put it out of his mind for the time being . As he drove over to the other apartment , something else struck him : I ran get ild of this car Thatll bring in some more money to help set me up . All that assumed his older self was n't hanging around in 1999 . Justin did n't know himself-at-forty was n't , not for a fact . If his older self did remain here in the twentieth century , Justin still intended to punch his lights out the first chance he got . He was loading twenties and fifties and hundreds into shopping bags , feeling a lot like a gangster , when he thought , I can move out of this apartment , too , and get back whatever security deposits my older self'paid-part of them , anyway . In spite of the handfuls of greenbacks he was taking out of the drawer , every dollar felt important . He wondered what his quarter from 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything at all . But then he shook his head . " I 'll keep it , " he dedared , as if someone had told him not to . " It 'll remind me what I 'm shooting for . " More than a little nervously , he took the cash down to the car . He managed it without getting mugged . He did n't think he 'd ever driven so carefully in his life as on the trip back to the Acapulco . He 'd never watched the rear-view mirror so much , either . Do n't want to get rearended now . Oh , Jesus , no . As he parked in front of the apartment building , a nasty thought hit him . What 'll I do if be just walked away for a few minutes and now he 's back in my place ? Punching his older self 's lights out still seemed like a good plan But the apartment was empty . With a sigh of relief , Justin stashed the bags of cash in the little closet in the hallway that led from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a couple of pans by the door . He 'd have to get the lock changed , but in the meantime at least he 'd have some warning if his older self was still around and tried to come in . " Have to get the rest of my stuff out of that other place , too , " he said . But , for the time being , that could wait . He quickly went through the apartment , looking for whatever his older self had left behind . Finding a laptop from 2018-if himself-at-forty had had one with him-would have been the grand prize . He did n't . But he did find a statement from a bank he would n't have patronized if a stagecoach had run over him . When he saw how much it was for , his eyes bugged out of his head : about as much as he had in those bags in the closet . And it 's mine , too , he thought dazedly . If he 's gone , it 's mine . I can prove I 'm Justin Kloster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's maiden name just as well as be did . For a moment , thinking of only one thing at a time , he actually felt grateful toward his older self . A twenty-one-yearold guy with six figures " worth of money in the bank and with a plan to get ahead ... What could n't he do ? I ca n't have Megan . His joy blew out . Cash was great , but without his girl ? Whatever his older self had done there , he 'd screwed it up bigtime . And he 'd said he 'd never found anybody else who came dose to her . Maybe I can get her back , Justin thought . Maybe in a couple weeks , or when school starts again and I see her Or something . He shoved the thought aside . He could n't do anything about it now . Himself-at-forty had seen to that . Justin started getting angry all over again . And he did n't get any happier when he looked at what was in the refrigerator . It was all stuff he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even worse stuff than had been in his older self 's other place when he first got there . What were you supposed to do with ginger root or hoisin sauce ? He did n't know , and he was n't interested in learning . But then he started to laugh . He could afford to eat out , by God . Eat out he did . Yang Chow was oddson the best Chinese place in this end of the Valley . He devoured kung-pao chicken and chili shrimp , with a Tsingtao beer to put out the fire from the peppers . No sign of his older self when he got back . Justin called the other place . The phone rang and rang . After it had gone on ringing for more than a minute , he hung up again , nodding . His older self was n't there , either . The more he was n't there , the more convinced Justin was that he 'd gone back to 2018 . " He should have stayed there , the son of a bitch , " Justin said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shit-even if we did n't , I 'd still have the good memories he did . What have I got now ? Not one damn thing . " Before he went to bed , he changed the sheets and bedspread . He did n't even want to think about what had happened on the ones he threw in the clothes basket . He slept late the next morning , which annoyed him . He had a lot of stuff he wanted to do that day : formally leave the other apartment , close his older self 's banking account and move the money to his own , sell that other Toyota and put the proceeds from the deal in the bank , too . He was just heading out the door when the phone rang . " Jesus ! " he said , and hurried back to the bedroom . Maybe it was his older self That would screw things up . Or maybe it was Megan . That would do anything but . " Hello ? " It was n't himself-at-forty . It was n't Megan , either , dammit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded pissed to the max . " Where the hell are you , Kloster ? " he shouted . " That graphic-design outfit is coming in this morning to order their new Macs , and they do n't want to deal with anybody but you . " He said something under his breath about " Macintosh primadonnas , " then went back to bellowing : " What are you doing there when you 're supposed to be here ? " Justin had forgotten all about his CompUSA job . Evidently , his older self had been holding it down pretty well . With all the money he had , he was tempted to tell his boss to stuff it , but he did n't . That would look bad on a resume . He gave the best excuse he could think of- " I must have forgotten to set my alarm last night . I 'll be right there . " His boss promptly tempted him to regret his choice , roaring , " If they show up before you do , you 're toast ! " and hanging up hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to review things before the graphic designers trooped in . Before they trooped out again , they 'd bought about fifty grand worth of computers and peripherals , and his boss was acting amazingly human . Said boss even took him to lunch at a Mexican place not nearly so good as Sierra's-though he would n't have wanted to go there now-and did n't say boo when he ordered a margarita to go with his enchilada and rice and refried beans . After lunch , he was upgrAding system software on one of the iMac , demos when he heard footsteps behind him . He turned around to see who it was ; the Macintosh ministore inside the CompUSA did n't get nearly the foot traffic he thought it deserved . " Lindsey ! " he exclaimed . " What are you doing here ? " " Well , you told me where you worked . " She looked nervous . " I just thought I 'd come over and say hi . HU " She fluttered her fingers at him in an arch little wave , then quickly went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . I know you said you were seeing somebody . " By the way she stood on the balls of her feet , she was poised to flee if Justin barked at her . But that , right this second , was the last thing he wanted to do . " I was , yeah , " he answered , and watched her eyes widen at the past tense , " but we just broke up . Somebody came between us , I guess you 'd say . " Oh , my God ! " Lindsey exclaimed , and then frowned anxiously . " I hope you do n't mean me . She was n't , like , jealous " cause you went up to Simi Valley and ran into me or anything ? That 'd be awful . " " No , no , no , " Justin assured her . " Had nothing to do with you . It was another guy . An older guy . " The first and last parts of that were true , anyway . The middle ? He was n't so sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You must be all torn up inside . " She reached out and put a sympathetic hand on his arm . " I was bummed , " he admitted-about as much as a male his age was likely to say . " It 's really nice , that you came all the way from Simi to see me . " They both laughed , even though Justin had n't quite made the joke on purpose . Lindsey smiled at him . He was n't always fast on the uptake , but something got through . He set his hand on hers . " Who knows ? " he said . " Maybe it wo n't work out too bad after all .
