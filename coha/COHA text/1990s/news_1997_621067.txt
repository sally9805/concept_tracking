<p> In August , when the French middle class heads en masse for the holiday beaches , it is as though a white veil has been lifted from this city to reveal a hidden black world . <p> Paris , apart from the main tourist haunts , is an African metropolis in midsummer  --  visibly the overseas capital of Senegal and Mali , Benin and Togo , the Congo and the Ivory Coast . It is the city of Mensah Papavi . <p> Few of the vacationing French have ever heard of Papavi , but to the hidden Paris he is " King Mensah , " the world 's best African singer in 1997 , according to a recent U.N . survey . His realm is a circuit of storefront nightclubs in the tawdry Barbes district below Montmartre , and further out in the bleak industrial suburbs , where there is seldom a cover charge and the customers do n't even begin showing up until midnight . <p> They arrive discreetly in twos and threes , keeping to the shadows . To be an African in Paris in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sans papiers "  --  undocumented immigrants  --  or from extreme-right bullies who are obsessed by the sight of a black face on a French street . <p> The hidden Paris is often a land of arbitrary violence . But it is also a world of the imagination , and the 26-year-old King Mensah is one of its most eloquent artists . He is a spinner of fables , with a voice so profound that it seems to rise from a village deep in his native Togo , mounting to a rhythmic chant that caresses the Paris night . <p> " When I sing , it is more than words and music , " he says . " It is a way of dreaming . " <p> The dream is a poet 's reincarnation of African village life , accompanied by the mesmerizing voice of Tetia Oyourou of the Ivory Coast , Papavi 's girlfriend and back-up vocalist . Tetia closes her eyes as she sings and moves with a barely perceptible sway  --  " a palm tree in a soft breeze , " one fan says of her  --  as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> *  --  <p> Neither the French government nor immigrant aid groups is willing to estimate the total number of black Africans in France , although unofficial figures range as high as 1 million . <p> According to the French Interior Ministry , there are 3.6 million foreigners legally residing in the country , about half of them from Sub-Saharan and Arab Africa . But there are no reliable statistics on citizens of African origin , who are simply classified as " French , " much less the sans papiers . <p> " Africans do n't announce their presence if they can help it , and no one else wants to count them except for the National Front , " says Mohammed Djalo , a family counselor in Barbes , referring to the virulently anti-immigrant political party led by right-wing extremist Jean-Marie Le Pen . <p> The higher the reported number of Africans , the thinking goes , the more likely it is that the political temperature will rise . It is in almost everyone 's interest that the numbers remain foggy  --  except for the Front , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its unambiguously racist message . <p> The Front cites studies indicating that foreigners constitute more than 30 percent of the prison population but less than 7 percent of the overall population of France . <p> Immigrant advocates , however , point out that a quarter of imprisoned foreigners have been convicted of no crime other than illegal entry into France . The share of those indicted for more serious infractions has remained stable at 14 percent since 1976 , a period that has seen an enormous jump in undocumented immigration . <p> In response to the Front 's growing power , the Gaullist government of former Prime Minister Alain Juppe implemented a tough new immigration policy , giving police the right to stop " suspected illegals " on the street and file immediate deportation orders on those who lacked papers . <p> The Front goes much further , advocating the immediate forced deportation of all Arabs and black Africans from France  --  including those who are legally in the country . <p> Economists insist that the work Africans normally do in France has little bearing on the 13 percent French unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " like the National Front . <p> Documented black Africans sweep out the gutters of Paris , by hand , with long plastic brooms . " The undocumented clean restaurant toilets , carry loads of bricks at construction sites and keep house for the middle class , at a pay level far below that of unemployment checks , " says Cathy Bion , a special education teacher who works with African children in Barbes . <p> Yet few centrist politicians have the courage these days to assert that there is no connection between African immigration and French joblessness . <p> Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin , who unseated Juppe in spring parliamentary elections , has proposed a modest alteration of the policy that preserves its toughest anti-immigrant measures . <p> " There is no political will to break with the ( restrictive ) laws , " says Abadacar Diop , the chief organizer of a peaceful sit-in of sans papiers at a Catholic church in Barbes last year . Many of the participants had been in France for a decade and had children or spouses who were French citizens . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was broken up by club-wielding riot police . <p> *  --  <p> For several hundred of King Mensah 's admirers , home is a six- story " foyer Africain " in the eastern suburb of Montreuil , a grim stretch of abandoned factories and warehouses not far from the bare- bones rented room that Papavi shares with Tetia . <p> The term , which translates as " African hearth , " has become a common euphemism for the appalling immigrant slums that encircle the City of Light . <p> Along the building 's cracked and unlit halls , rooms are jammed to the ceiling with bunk beds for the undocumented immigrants who call the place home . There are more than a dozen occupants in most , stacked up amid piles of cheap plastic sacks that hold all of their possessions . Each hall has a single toilet and cold-water shower . <p> Conditions are only marginally better in the Barbes district , inside the city limits , where immigrants head as soon as they can afford less crowded accommodations . According to local officials , 47 percent of the apartments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no baths or showers . <p> On a sweltering Saturday morning , the foyer residents in Montreuil have spilled into what amounts to a scale-model African rural village reconstructed whole in the building 's courtyard , which measures about 50 feet wide by 75 feet long . <p> A garbage dumpster occupies the center . Along one of its flanks , a row of hard chairs serve as an open-air barber shop . On the opposite side of the dumpster , four metalworkers pound homemade cooking instruments into shape on small anvils . Merchants sell loose cigarettes , matches , plastic sandals and music cassettes from folding tables . <p> Inside the courtyard 's western door , half a dozen women from Mali stand over enormous pots of millet , the braised tripe dish known as " fou-fou " and vegetable soup . <p> The food , the noise of the tapping of the metalworkers ' mallets and the open-air barbers are Africa . Like Papavi and Tetia 's nostalgic songs , the sounds and smells in the courtyard have the power to answer a homesick wayfarer 's longing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful realities : the realities of a hidden life in Paris . The realities that send Africans to France in the first place . <p> *  --  <p> The rising tide of French racial hostility has prompted a marked shift in the nature of African immigrant dreams , especially among the young . " Among my friends , the place to be is n't France anymore . It 's America , " says Edith Maga , 18 . <p> " We understand very well that racism exists in the United States too . But the possibilities of life are much greater for a black person in New York or Los Angeles than they are in France . " <p> In its way , the same shift explains why Georges Momboye , one of the most respected dancers and choreographers in Paris , wears an Oakland A 's baseball cap on the street . Put bluntly , he hopes to be taken for an African American tourist . <p> " I have been stopped and searched by the police as many as three times in a single day , " says Momboye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " What happens to Georges Momboye happens to all of us , to anyone with a black skin in Paris , " says Papavi . " Just think of how Americans would react if Frank Sinatra performed in France and the police arrested him several times a day . " <p> In a 1996 report to the United Nations , human rights investigator Maurice Glele-Ahanhanzo wrote that " France is being shaken by a wave of xenophobia and racism that is highly prejudicial to its image as the homeland of human rights . " <p> His report found that 62 percent of the French admit to having " racist attitudes " and that 68 percent confirmed that they had personally witnessed incidents of racial harassment . <p> To be an African in France , says Momboye , " is to learn every possible sense of the word ' patience . ' " Yet Africans keep arriving in large , if unspecified , numbers . Typically , says family counselor Mohammed Djalo , they secure a tourist visa to Italy or Spain ; French consulates in Africa are much less generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the mountains ; or in small boats that put them ashore on isolated beaches ; or in the sealed trailers of trucks after paying off a " passeur , " who smuggles emigrants across the border . <p> The fees paid to Europe 's thriving human smugglers range between $ 500 and $ 5,000 in a clandestine trade that exceeds $ 1.1 billion per year , according to the Vienna- based International Center for Migration Policy Development . <p> A reporter asks why the influx continues . Surely , he says , word of the ruthless passeurs , grim foyers and racial assaults has reached Africa . <p> Djalo answers immediately : " Monsieur , have you seen photographs of people in the desert regions of Mali or the shantytowns of Senegal ? When an African returns home , even if he has been deported , all that anyone notices is how fat he is by comparison with those who stayed behind . " <p> *  --   --  <p> The meaning of Africa  --  of what it means to be African , in its warm village intimacy and endless suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifts over the Montreuil warehouses on an August night . <p> Barbes and the industrial suburbs are the focal points of immigrant pain and French anger . Yet they are also the African version of Nashville and Tin Pan Alley , the irresistible magnets that attract singers , dancers , composers and musicians from every corner of French-speaking west and central Africa . <p> To remember the village past . To imagine a better future . " To dream in song , " says King Mensah . <p> Although he and Tetia still can not afford more than one room despite his growing fame , the dream of a better life is not entirely empty . There is Momboye , for instance , who is now invited to perform every year in the San Francisco Bay Area and just completed a sold-out week in Vienna . There is Papa Wemba of the Congo , who has used his Paris base to build a lucrative international audience . <p> " We have to put the images of death and famine behind us , not to forget them , but so that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Momboye says . <p> Edith Maga 's mother , Yvette , is the owner of the Village d'Afrique , a tiny Barbes grocery that also trades in African dreams . <p> The shop specializes in smoked fish and manioc , the root vegetable also known as cassava that is a staple of west and central African food , and in an array of favorite dishes from half a dozen African countries that mother and daughter cook themselves and freeze in small plastic bags . <p> All it takes to recover a taste of the Congo or Benin in Barbes is a one-burner kerosene stove , a cheap saucepan and one of the Magas ' frozen dinners . <p> Yvette , a naturalized French citizen who was born in the Ivory Coast , is a very rare creature in Paris . Even in Africa , black Africans seldom have the money to open their own businesses . The manioc and smoked fish she sells " are produced in Senegal by Lebanese merchants , then shipped to other Lebanese in Ivory Coast and on to Paris , " she points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to hire a dozen or so people in Ivory Coast and to create a real French- African food export industry for Africans , " Yvette says . <p> She is serious enough about it to have applied for a World Bank loan . So far , the bank has not responded , " but I have to believe that I 'm not wasting my time  --  that there is a chance someone will listen to me and understand that my idea makes sense , " she adds . <p> " More and more , I try to sing about hope , " says King Mensah , " because we Africans have had enough of despair by now .
