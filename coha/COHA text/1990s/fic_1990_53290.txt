THE RED FORD PICKUP ran the straight asphalt of U.S. 50 along the high water of Tomichi Creek , and from where I was , high in the upper meadow by the weir , the sun flashed intermittently from its windshield . For an instant the explosion of light blinded me , leaving my vision blurred , the way a gust of wind might ripple the reflection in a calm pool . I had no reason to expect the driver was Angie Warren , though she must have known I was back.in the valley . There are preternatural moments when time stands cold and still as stone , and other moments when it evaporates like raise rain or like a story one has read but ca n't remember . I watched the red truck carve a line through the backdrop of gray sage hills and fluttery light green aspens and pass out of sight behind one of the knolls . Poised with my shovel at the ditch , dressed in my mother 's old plaid shirt and her black rubber boots , I felt as if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had vanished like the red truck . I was gazing out at the same highway , at the same meadows of timothy and alfalfa , at the identical patches of rapidly melting snow which lingered in the shady depressions of the ridge . A mountain bluebird  --  perhaps the same one  --  shimmered like an azure butterfly above the new grass . <p> But the truck emerged from behind the hill in predictable sequence , and when it slowed and turned onto the county gravel along the barbed wire at the edge of the lower meadow , I was not surprised . I returned to the ditch work , braced my body on the bank , and sliced the shovel into the earth . The bank did not need shoring up so much as the ditch needed cleaning , for over the years willows had grown up along its length and the channel had silted in . I lifted a heavy clump of wet earth and grass and tamped it into a gap through which water was flowing . <p> The melt was uncommonly high for so late in spring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length of the valley , the broad curves of Tomichi Creek looked like the surface of a lake  --  glistening , dancing in the slight breeze and sunlight like quicksilver in the mind 's eye . Yet though there was high water , there had been no rain . The roads were dry , and dust trailed behind the pickup which had turned into my gravel drive . <p> I spaded more earth into the leaks , pretending not to notice Angie waiting in the cab for the dust to settle . <p> Three weeks before I had been living in Casper , Wyoming , which was where Henry Carris came to tell me my father had died . I had n't been long in Casper-only two months  --  but already I knew the hills above the river , the barren prairie east of town , the highway west toward Riverton . It was a depressed city because of the oil bust , a city I liked for its empty houses and blank stores . <p> I was surprised when Henry appeared at my efficiency apartment . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ askew . His face was kindly and soft-looking , though he had worked the weather of his ranch all his life . " I 'm sorry to be the one , " he said . " Someone had to come . " <p> " How did you find me ? " I asked . <p> " Oh , well , Casper ai n't a very big town . " He gave a shrug . <p> " I 've been gone a while . " <p> He nodded . " I do n't know . It 's the first place I looked . I guess I just had you figured right . " <p> Before Casper I had lived in Cheyenne and Denver and Colorado Springs , each time moving north a little toward the cold . I wanted to make my migration slow and solitary , to wash out the traces of my life in each place I lived . In Denver I 'd sold toys ; in Cheyenne I spooned out vegetables in a cafeteria line ; in Casper I was a maid in a motel . I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours and the money . I had chosen to live in silence . <p> But there was always someone who remembered your face , someone for whom you did a favor or to whom you seemed lonely  --  some clue which lingered after you like a scent . " Was it the old woman who sold newspapers ? " I asked Henry . " Or the man who waves to me every morning from his window ? The bus driver ? " <p> " It was your mother , " Henry said . " Rest her soul . " <p> I was at the sink , running the water , waiting for the hot to siphon through the pipes , while Angie paced the linoleum floor in and out of the sunlight which slanted through the filmy curtains . " I called earlier , " she said . " I called yesterday and let the phone ring a long time , and the day before that , too . " <p> " I was outside , " I said . <p> " At night ? " She stopped and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know your father was sick . " <p> " No . " <p> " Did n't you ever call ? " <p> The water came hot and , filling the kettle , 1 lingered at the window . The laundry I 'd done that morning  --  red and yellow and blue clothes fluttering on the line  --  looked stark and incongruous against the sunburned barn and the old tractor at the edge of the yard . I did n't answer Angie . I turned the stove on and set the kettle on the burner . " And he said you did n't want a funeral or anything . " " That 's right . " <p> " There was one for your mother , " Angie said . " What about the rest of us ? What about your father 's friends ? " <p> The illogic and the earnestness in her voice made me smile briefly . To think that others wanted to pay their respects to my father was a notion that struck me as insufficient and shallow , but Angie had always been one to believe in appearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cups and kept an eye on the kettle . <p> " It was Del who insisted we look for you . Did Henry tell you that ? " <p> I shook my head , and Angie stopped again . <p> " You do n't know anything , do you ? You do n't know about Del and me . Of course you do n't . Henry kept his mouth shut . " <p> " He said I was going to inherit the property , " I said . " That 's about all . He said he 'd been taking care of things since my father died . " <p> " Well , Jesus , " Angie said . She sat down in a chair at the kitchen table and put her hands out flat , palms down . " Me and Del got divorced three years ago . He found me in a motel over on the west side with Teddy Platte . Was n't Teddy an old flame of yours ? " <p> " Long ago . " <p> " It was n't Del 's fault really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wagon Wheel where I was working . Del did n't have much patience for that kind of thing . He 's working in a mine now over in Jeffersonville . " <p> " Del is ? " <p> " It 's real good money . " <p> The water boiled hard and I poured the cups full . <p> It was hard to imagine Del as a miner . Even in grade school he 'd loved the outdoors  --  fishing , hunting , cattle , weather . When my father was sick in bed , Del helped my mother mend fences and doctor the cows . He loved to ride up into the high country looking for strays . Sometimes I went along on my pinto pony , and we 'd ascend the steep gullies , circle the aspen benches , and climb up to the Engelmann spruce which was good habitat for deer and grouse . Once in the white-skinned quakies we found a cow which had calved . Her hind legs had been paralyzed from the birth and she could n't stand . She 'd drag herself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lick her calf so it had n't suffocated . Del took the calf down over his saddle and brought the cow food . Every day after school he rode up three-quarters of an hour with oats and hay until the cow finally died . <p> " I always liked Del , " I said . <p> " So did I. " Angie smiled and blew across the rim of her coffee cup . " I always liked men in general . " <p> Angie had been the pretty one when we were younger . She and I were friends because we lived at the end of the bus line  --  the first to be picked up in the morning and the last to get off in the afternoon . We waited together at the row of mailboxes on the highway , watching the sun 's first breath tarnish the hills . Angie never talked about homework or assignments . She spoke of the ordinary things : what someone else had said , how people looked , who liked whom . Her body filled out long before mine , and she drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school the puerile snickers and stares . She wore her hair in cascading lacquered curls which smelled vaguely of roses , and I used to wonder why she made herself such a spectacle . What did she hope to gain dying her hair blond and wearing makeup and perfume ? <p> Once when we were riding home and Angie was talking about Del , I reached over and touched her frosted curls , stroked the brittle teases she had constructed so carefully . She stopped in mid-sentence and smiled at me , as if accepting this gesture as an intimacy which could not be defined in words . Did n't I know ? she seemed to ask . And I understood then and afterward that even as friends we were antagonists , even as confidantes we were enemies . <p> But we were both older now . Angie 's hair was still bleached , but no longer stiff and sprayed . She still had the same graceful movements , but the lines at the corners of her mouth were more vivid than her body . Seeing her sitting at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll . <p> She talked to me . She turned her cup round and round on the table , held it poised in the air , looked wistfully around the kitchen . She recounted her life  --  hours in a motel room in Moab , Utah , days and nights in the Wagon Wheel , arguments with lovers . It was a life not unusual , a slow dissimilation not unlike my own , but with different details . <p> When she got up to go the sun was already sliding into the west . She gave me a hug and asked me to visit her at the Wagon Wheel . Then she held me by the shoulders . " Did you ever find your mother 's stories ? " <p> " I wanted to settle in first , " I said , "  --  to see whether I can manage . " <p> " Of course you can manage . " I gave her a brief smile . <p> " I 'm sorry about your father , " she said , and she turned away . <p> As a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my room . I woke and wished for the cool moon , the breeze beyond the window , the rolling sage-scented hills . But it was not merely the darkness which troubled me . The room lacked movement , air . And sometimes , then , through the frame of the wooden house , I heard my mother 's clicking typewriter , like an insect 's language I could not fathom  --  bursts of static trailed by long pauses , as if she were responding to heat or barometric pressure . I would creep from my room , past my father 's open door through which came the noises of his anguished sleep . I descended the stairs and , so as not to risk the door 's creaking , climbed through the open window onto the front porch . Stars pelted the sky , and the sweet-grass breeze cooled my forehead . I edged around the corner of the house to the window in the vestibule alcove where my mother sat hunched over a yellow page rolled into her typewriter . Her face was illuminated by a single shaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a ferocious glare that seeing her gave concrete and sensory rationale to my fear . Her dark hair was damp at her temples , her fingers poised like a falcon 's talons over the keyboard . But for minutes she would do nothing . What was she thinking ? What did she know ? What were these stories about ? <p> Then suddenly she looked up . She looked directly at the window , though not through it , seeing perhaps in the nearness of the glass her own likeness , yet not herself , not me . She seemed to me then brilliantly alive , as if what tormented her a moment before also gave her pleasure now , and I thought : I do not know this woman . I do not know my own mother ! And all I would ever know of her was the face she chose at any particular moment to show me . <p> My father had died nearly two weeks before Henry Carris came to find me . He had been in and out of the hospital for weeks , then for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who would prolong the functioning of cells . And then he died . Del and Angie made no progress finding me until Del ran into Henry . <p> Henry had been thinking about me , he said . The lawyer , Wesley Pape , had asked where I was . <p> But it was not me Henry was thinking of . It was my mother . He had loved my mother for years , and I think she loved him , too , though she never spoke his name . So much was hidden from me then . When Henry visited my family with his wife , Anita , they would sit on the porch drinking beer and talking . My mother had a way of speaking that was like music . Her physical appearance was stern , and she always wore work clothes or plain cotton dark dresses . Her hair was coiled at the nape of her neck . But when she talked the lilting cadence of her voice was as astonishing as finding a sapphire on the sidewalk , as if the words borne on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most intently to everything she said . I remember one night sitting on the steps listening to her tell stories of her girlhood in Casper , how Henry asked her questions about the plains and the riverbed where she played , about the school she had gone to there , as if he were trying to discover the makings of the person she was then . And I listened , too , hearing beneath her words the shrouded meanings of a landscape and the surreptitious wandering of her heart . <p> In my father 's absence Henry had kept an eye on the ranch , grazing the cattle in the high country which in spring was lush with grass . The sick ones he hauled by truck to his own feedlot to doctor . It was almost as easy to look after twenty sick cattle as a dozen . But he did n't have the manpower to do more on the land than ride the fences and , now and then , to look in on the house . <p> So the ditches had been untended and the meadows flooded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anonymous life in Casper , I had no one to help me . A hay meadow was like a single plant : it could be killed by heat or by drought or drowned by too much water . What little grew in too much water was n't worth harvesting , and if a season were wasted and no hay put up , the winter was expensive . Cattle had to be fed or sold , and either choice made under duress was a bad one . It was costly to buy feed , and forced selling was a sure way to lose because cattle prices were as fickle as wind . <p> Of course I inquired about part-time labor , but construction in town , Henry said , had absorbed every available man . " You would n't know the place if you drove through , " he said . " There are office buildings and new houses everywhere . There ai n't no one going to dig ditches . " <p> So every morning I put on my mother 's black rubber irrigation boots and her gray gloves with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by the steering wheel of the tractor , and I worked on the ditches . I diverted water from one field to another while I repaired one section . I cut and sprayed the willows , removed silt , shored up holes that muskrats had riddled through the banks . Every day my muscles cried from the lifting and shoveling , and my hands blistered despite the gloves . My thin bare arms below my shirtsleeves were burned by the sun ; my eyes ached from the sun 's glancing off the water . <p> This had been my mother 's life for fifty years , and I stopped often , out of breath , to rest my eyes against the blue sky . It was like homesickness how well I knew the path of the sun , how each day I felt the arc ride higher into the north , how the clear morning gave way to clouds in the afternoon . A curtain of rain appeared every afternoon over the far peaks : a storm which seemed to gain strength as the day progressed but which never reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooler air . It was dusk when I went to bed . I lay on the bed my mother slept in , conscious of the light 's ebbing outside the window , aware of the strange images like clouds which whirled through my mind  --  fantasies , cirrus pictures , scudding scenes of childhood that invaded my thoughts unbidden . I assumed my exhaustion spawned these musings which formed themselves from nowhere and blew heedlessly across the blank terrain . I remembered , for example , how one night , fresh with fear , I knocked on my parents ' bedroom door and listened to their whispering voices : " It 's Becky , " my mother said . And my father answered , " Do n't get up . She has to learn . " <p> And my mother could not disobey him . I slumped against the cold door , shivering , my face pressed to the wood . My mother coughed , and though I needed to hold her , I understood her signal . We were together against him , always , both of us awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them when they collected the bales of hay from the fields , how I hid behind the bales and peered out , hating my father for the work my mother did . She drove the tractor , wearing a red handkerchief over her nose to keep the dust and pollen from her sinuses , while my father walked behind and lifted the bales onto the flatbed trailer . I ran from bale to bale , pretending to shoot him with a stick , sliding to safety each time behind an imaginary bunker , until one by one the bales disappeared onto the trailer and I had nowhere to hide . <p> These were fragments of my dusk dreams . It was always to my mother I gravitated , to her who fueled the deeper dreams which haunted me in the black hours of sleep . <p> One Saturday I walked up into the high country above the meadows . The moraine was brittle soil , capable of growing only sage and mesquite and rabbit brush , but on up another thousand feet the aspens and spruce gave good cover to blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their populations from year to year , silent . When they were alerted to danger , they froze , and if one came too close they exploded in frenzied flight . But that morning there were no grouse . I climbed up through the trees and sat high up on a granite outcropping from which I could see the ranch below and the valley stretched out between the foothills . The highway followed the straight line above the creek , down through miles of willows , toward the chunks of the distant town . <p> Clouds drifted from the west and banked in behind the mountains  --  the pattern in spring . But the days would erode gradually into pure blue summer . <p> That morning I had searched for my mother 's stories . The house had felt right to me again , the rhythms of my day more secure . I had become used to the cool silent mornings , the midday sun , the slow slide from evening into night , which were my mother 's daily encounters . I looked through boxes in the attic  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , checkbooks from the last twenty years , letters from aunts and uncles . In the closets I found some letters my father had written when he was in the military , rambling accounts of Valdosta , Georgia , and the countryside around Fort Ord , California . But I found not a single sheet of yellow paper , not one manuscript or jotting in my mother 's hand that might have been called a world invented . Were there no stories ? Had I conjured them from her sorrowful face , from the nights of ebb and flow of the typewriter keys , from the sweetness of her voice ? Or had they been destroyed ? My father 's demands for attention had already consumed her physical life . Had he taken from her as well , after she died , her only real existence ? <p> Someone pulled into the driveway far below me and steered a dilapidated Volkswagen into the yard . When that someone emerged , his face was hidden by a cowboy hat , but as he walked to the house the stride was apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes of his boots . It was Del Kinney . <p> How ironic that he was the one to call me home when , long ago , he had given me the impetus to leave . He knocked on the back door , and when no one answered , he shielded his eyes to the window glass and peered inside . He might have seen my coffee cups unwashed on the counter , the greasy pan on the stove , the spray of buttercups on the table . Though the door was unlocked , he did n't try it . A gust of wind caught his hat , and he chased it across the short porch and down into the yard . When he caught it , he stood for a moment hat in hand , his red hair lifting in the breeze , and gazed up into the hills as if he knew I was there . But by then I had hidden . <p> In high school , Del and I had been friends , not lovers . We liked the same things . Sometimes , when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to stop by the main weir at a pond where he fished , and one evening I saw his truck there and pulled in . I expected to see him at the edge of the pond , arcing his line out over the smooth surface , settling the fly on the sheen of reflected clouds . But he was up above the pond in a brace of thick willows . He signaled to me to come over . <p> He had discovered a water snake in the grass . The snake had caught a small brookie . " He got it sideways , " Del said . " I heard the fish slapping water . " <p> The snake had dragged the trout from the water into the air and was not the least concerned about us . When the fish was weak enough , the snake released its grip little by little to maneuver it around to be ingested head first . The fish still wriggled , even when it was halfway down into the snake 's mouth . <p> We watched this small spectacle until it was nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , letting the dusk sift over us . It was as though the scene we had witnessed had pressed us into some new world where death had its place . We might have stayed in that silence forever : We might have agreed to the seasons , to the aging of our own bodies , to the endless measuring of water into and out of the pond . But suddenly the air came alive with the sound of ducks ' wingbeats  --  greenwings and cinnamons spilling through the dark . They swirled and diverged above us , and once our presence was assimilated , slid onto the glassy water . <p> This was the time to say yes to him , to embrace in words what we knew of ourselves . But Del did not ask , and I was too shy , and the moment passed beyond us . When the night chill came on , when the moon rose , we made our way back up to the gravel road with nothing said , nothing changed . <p> Del left no note for me that morning . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jeans pocket for a pencil but when I climbed down after he left , there was nothing in the door . What would he have said to me ? That he was sorry about my father 's death ? That he wanted to see me ? Perhaps he had thought better of giving himself away . He had carried out whatever intention he had to a certain point , but when he was actually there , where I lived , he must have known his coming had made no difference . I could imagine he preferred his act to be a solitary event without consequence , as harmless as that night years ago at the pond when I loved him . <p> And it would have been true : no matter what his motive was for coming it would have fallen silent as a tree in the forest , except that I had seen him . <p> My father used to come into my room in the middle of the night when I was sleeping . He pulled the covers from me gently , and after a while I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold air and search for the covers and see him there . <p> " You were having a dream , " he 'd say , or " You were calling out . " <p> But I did not remember dreaming or calling out . <p> Sometimes I woke to the touch of his hand on my shoulder or on my back . <p> " I was just watching you , " he 'd say . <p> And sometimes I woke as if I sensed he was there . The black room lay around me , and though I thought someone was in the room , I was too ashamed to call out , too afraid to investigate the darkness at the foot of my bed where I felt my father , breathing his own shame . <p> I went into town on Monday to sign some documents at the lawyer 's office which had to be filed with the probate court . These were the final dispositions of my father 's estate , including the house and the land , though it was not his only legacy to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me there was always memory . <p> Afterwards I decided to stop by the Wagon Wheel to say hello to Angie . The Wagon Wheel was the kind of bar I imagined existed in every town , a place off-limits to me , dark , filled with men drinking and playing pool . Once in the broad daylight of my girlhood I remembered seeing a man stagger from that bar  --  eyes slitted against the sun  --  to urinate in the street . <p> That afternoon was chilly and the room was dark and warm . There was a jukebox , a pool table , a mahogany slab at which a few men sat on stools . Behind the bar a mirror reflected the liquor bottles and the wagon wheel light fixtures that hung low over the tables . Dozens of dollar bills were taped to the wall at the end of the bar , each with a signature on it , as if the patron had been enshrined by his money . <p> Angie insisted I have a drink . " It 's a celebration , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She fixed two old-fashioneds and set one in front of me on the bar . She held the other up as a toast . " I 'm not supposed to drink on the job , but everyone knows me . Here 's to your return . " <p> We drank . <p> " So what are you going to do with all that land ? " she asked . " I 'm thinking of selling . " <p> Angie drank another swallow and smiled . " Have you seen what 's been happening in town ? " <p> " I 'm not in town . " <p> " Ferguson 's Soda Fountain is Ferguson 's Drug Center . Safeway 's building a new store . Widemann 's Lumber is booming . There are houses going up along the bluffs and in Springer Canyon . And condos . In a year or two , the town will be spread out to you . " <p> " Like a disease . " <p> Angie shrugged . " You might as well make money from it . " <p> She took another drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to the town ? I had lived in places far worse . I drank again . <p> Angie mixed two more old-fashioneds and slid another to me . People filtered in . Then she was busy for a while , setting up Coors and Budweiser for the crowd just off work . She took orders with a minimum of fuss , smiled , flirted a little , laughed . I envied the way she could make three or four people at once feel as if she were paying attention to them . <p> I finished my second drink , and Angie refilled it . <p> A man slid onto the stool beside me and looked at the three toothpicks I had lined up on the bar . " You been here a while , " he said . He was a construction worker and smelled of cedar . <p> " A while . " <p> " Angie 'll chalk them up for you . " He smiled cheerfully . I felt my old inclination to harden , to shrivel like a leaf snapped off by a frigid wind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't meant anything . He was just someone who had sat down . " I 'm really not much of a drinker , " I said . <p> A pool game started up at the back of the room , and the jukebox , silent until then , rolled out a country-and-western song which came disembodied from behind a knot of people in the corner . Voices rose around me like wind chimes clanging metal on metal . of sounds and light on a river through <p> " You look kind of familiar , " the man said . " My name 's Teddy Platte . " <p> I did n't answer . I drank my third old-fashioned quickly to make a break , but I began to feel a heaviness in the air , the pleasant distancing <p> But I was not in a nameless city . I was in a bar called the Wagon Wheel , in a town I grew up near , in a crowd of people , some of whom I used to know . <p> Even so , I was about to get up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Teddy Platte toward the exit when I saw Del . He was standing in a wedge of sunlight as someone threw open the door behind him . He was sweaty and dirty , and a line of grit crossed his forehead where his hat had been . His red hair was usually the first thing one noticed , but he had a way of standing which was just as distinctive , like someone slightly off balance , leaning forward , unable to stop a spring into midair . <p> But Del did n't spring . He searched the crowd , and I had the eerie sensation he was looking for me . Heat rushed to my face . The room whirled . He gazed past Angie right at me . <p> Then his gaze slid across me , too . It was a moment as brief as a thin cloud 's passing in front of the sun . No one would have noticed a shadow . He pushed his way forward into the crowd , apparently having seen someone he knew over by the jukebox . <p> " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I smiled at him and lowered my eyes . " I did n't say . " <p> The road wavered before me like a moving reel of film . It was dark , and my father 's old truck floated across the pavement as if through space . The headlights beamed out into the willows along Tomichi Creek and the high water shone like muted diamonds in the moonlight . It was not late-perhaps nine o'clock-but I had been drinking old-fashioneds in the Wagon Wheel all that time . Angie 's fault . Teddy Platte 's fault . Buying drinks for me , talking . Telling everyone I was back . Angie up on the bar announcing it . I could n't get away . <p> Teddy was nothing like I remembered him . He was losing his hair . He told jokes . He told one about a truck driver who saw a naked woman , but now I ca n't remember it . I saw Del 's face , too , swimming from the crowd , past the bar , as if avoiding me , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wherever men go when they leave a bar , and I felt free , suddenly , not as if chains had been loosed from me , nothing so simple , but the way a woman felt when she grasped that looks did not matter anymore . Del was not the person he was ; he could n't have been . Nothing could be as it was before . <p> I passed the Lancasters ' ranch and saw ahead the brilliantly illuminated feed pens at the Carris 's , as if out of the night there emerged some new spectre . I had an odd sensation of stillness , the motor 's stopping , the truck 's sliding , though I was holding it straight upon the road . I remembered one time when my father had gone elk hunting and I had gotten up early , overjoyed at the quiet in the house . I went to my mother 's room where she was putting up her hair . The sun fell through the dust motes in the room , striking a portion of the unmade bed . She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the glass . Her hair was long and fine and dark , grown out nearly to her waist . Her sturdy arm swept the brush through it as if there were no resistance in the brushing . Several times she paused and pulled her hair over her shoulder and gazed at herself in the glass . <p> " Why do n't you wear your hair that way ? " I asked . <p> " I could n't , " she said . <p> I did not see why . She looked at me with a wistful glance , tilted her head back so that her hair hung straight down over the back of the chair in the sunlight . I remembered her expression then , how her eyes stared upward as if in supplication , how beautiful she was , and how sorrowful she must have been all her life for having to transform herself from the woman she was that moment into the woman she had to become for my father . <p> The glistening arc lights of the Carris 's feed pens swirled past me like dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acrid smell , wakened me for a minute , filled the tight space of the truck cab . I rolled down the window , and by the time I 'd escaped the lights the smell was gone , cleaned from the cab by the scent of sage . <p> The road smoothed out a mile or so after the Carris 's , where new asphalt had been laid . The truck glided , and I slowed to let the calm take hold . The hills were shadows beyond the reach of the headlights , but I knew that road : I knew the bends and the swales . There were stories in this country of my own making , tales I had already dreamed of , new worlds I intended to make of the passing of the seasons . In the far dis-rance  --  miles away still  --  the solitary light of my house appeared beyond the low hills , disappeared , appeared again , trembling , it seemed , in the dean air like a comet moving away from me even as I rushed toward it along the highway through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
