<p> The year before Miss Addie finished the eighth grade and was the first person in our family to graduate from anywhere , a terrible thing almost happened . It was fall 1939 , and Addie , who was 13 , was ready to enter the eighth grade . To make some money for school clothes and supplies , the older children in the family had gone cotton picking with Uncle Porter and Aunt Alice . That 's how black children made extra money in those days to help with the family budget and to buy little extras for themselves . <p> Mama also had sent Pelton , 5 , and me - I was 4 - to the fields that morning . I think she needed a break from us . <p> Miss Addie loved to work . She threw herself into cotton picking at full steam . She and Uncle Porter and Aunt Alice were flying up and down the cotton rows in the blazing sun , their faded hats and bonnets flopping in the breeze while their speedy hands snatched the fluffy white cotton from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton sacks slung around their necks and under one of their arms . Their arms pumped up and down like cotton-plucking machines stuck onto their bodies . <p> Pelton and I dawdled about . We shared the same row and had shorter dingy-looking cotton sacks . We watched with fascination as Miss Addie and the others zoomed along . We picked as slowly as possible , adding lumps of dirt to make the sacks weigh more , an underhanded , if not illegal , activity . <p> " " You young ones stop that dawdling . Your momma sent you out here to work , so stop wasting time , " Aunt Alice screeched in her high-pitched voice . <p> " " Yes ma'am , " Pelton and I chorused . We kept on dawdling and complaining . <p> " " I 'm hot . " " " Me , too . " <p> " " I 'm thirsty . " <p> " " I think they 're loony . " <p> " " I do , too ! " <p> " " I love the Lord , " Aunt Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " " And pitied every moan , " the others sang back . <p> " " Long as I live and trouble rise " she squeaked again . <p> I noticed Miss Addie had stopped picking and had called to some girls in stiff starched dresses sauntering down the Crosby-Lynchburg Road . They yelled something back , and Miss Addie started moaning and crying . <p> " " Oh no , Lord , " she cried desperately , bursting into tears and flinging her hands over her face . <p> " " A snake 's bit her , " Uncle Porter exclaimed in his raspy voice . He threw off his cotton sack and rushed to Miss Addie , warning everyone to watch out . <p> " " You better quit that running , old man , before you have a stroke , " Aunt Alice shouted . " " Anyhow , snakes do n't slither around in the heat . " <p> We all gathered around Miss Addie , trying to find out what had happened . Trembling , shaking and crying , she pointed dramatically to the sauntering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaned . <p> " " What 's wrong with them ? " Uncle Porter asked . <p> " " It 's terrible . They 're going to school . It started . I asked them . They said it had . " Miss Addie moaned . " " They 're going to school , and I 'm stuck here in Mr. Van Netters ' ( SEE CORRECTION ) cotton patch . Oh , Lord . " <p> Uncle Porter was n't comfortable with Miss Addie 's outburst . He shifted from foot to foot , patted her on the shoulder and shook his head . Pelton and I were dumbstruck . We were too young to go to school and did n't intend to go at all . Aunt Alice felt that all any woman needed was a good man in her life . She sniffed indignantly , " " You better forget that schooling mess ! Ai n't no high school out here , and the white folks will never put one here if you ask me . " <p> Uncle Porter said , " " Do n't worry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You 're smart . You 'll catch up . " He and Aunt Alice trudged back to their cotton picking . <p> Miss Addie slumped on the cotton sack and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand . Pelton and I sat beside her . Behind her back , we always called our sister Miss Addie because she seemed so old to be so young , and so focused on this schooling and education business . <p> Her shoulders drooped tiredly as she said , " " I do n't have new shoes to wear to school tomorrow . Daddy 's going to buy them Saturday , out of this money we 're making . Mama 's got most of my clothes made . I 'll wash my hair and fix it tonight . Oh no ! <p> I ca n't go to school . We gave our word to Mr. Van Netters that we 'd finish this cotton for him . You ca n't break your word . <p> Daddy says that a body 's word is his bond . Lord , why 'd they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all the cotton 's picked ! " Miss Addie collapsed in tears again . <p> Pelton and I squirmed uneasily . I nudged Pelton , who timidly said , " " How come missing school is so terrible and upsets you so bad ? It 's a no-good thing , and I ai n't never going . " <p> Miss Addie 's head shot up and her shoulders straightened . She wiped her eyes and gave Pelton a withering look . " " Do n't say ' ai n't ' ! There is no such word , and do n't ever say you 're not going to school . It 's the most important thing a body can do for himself . Remember how Daddy sharpens the hoe when he 's going to the fields ? That 's because the sharper the hoe , the better it chops . <p> " " That 's what education and learning can do for your mind . <p> Sharpen it , make it strong , and then you 'll be free , able to go where you want to go and do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more free and independent you can be . <p> Mama says that every tub has to sit on its own bottom . That means being independent and free . You can travel and go to the great cities in the world - Paris , Rome , New York . And books . <p> You 'll be able to read all of those wonderful books of poems and stories . " Miss Addie clasped her hands as she spoke of travels and reading fine books . <p> " " The better the education you get , the better person you can be , and the bigger success you can be . " <p> Miss Addie sighed and looked into space . We would remember this lecture all our lives . <p> " " Look , Addie . Yonder those girls come . I bet they were n't going to school at all , " Pelton said , pointing at the girls who were walking back . <p> " " Did school start for real ? " Miss Addie called to them . <p> They almost fell down , laughing and pointing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't started ! We 've been to the post office . But you asked for a lie , so we told you one . " They laughed again . <p> Miss Addie paid no attention to the laughter . School had n't started . She could keep her word and pick all of Van Netters ' cotton and still get her shoes and school supplies . She was a happy person . " " Come on , we 've got work to do , " she said . <p> Grabbing her sack and slinging it around her neck , she went flying down her cotton row , arms pumping . <p> Miss Addie 's eighth-grade year passed so fast , it seemed like a blur . Mostly , I remember her bouncing up the hill in her white dress with the big red apples and the wide bow in the back and her shiny patent leather shoes . She was coming from her contests , and she would always have her chest covered with first-place ribbons . <p> Pelton and I started our " " Miss Addie Watching " game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gully , where she read books and recited poems we 'd creep down and lie in the bushes to listen and watch her act them out . One poem was about a mother waking up her son to get his day started , " " Lias , Lias , bless the Lord , do n't you know the day 's abroad ? " <p> She recited one about being in control of her life and destiny : " " I thank For my unconquerable soul My head is bloody , but unbowed ... the years ... shall find me unafraid " <p> We especially liked that poem . Miss Addie would fling her arms dramatically and shout the last stanza . " " I am the master of my fate : I am the captain of my soul ! " <p> Pelton and I would imitate Miss Addie . We 'd fling our arms and yell , " " I am the master of my fate ! " We even invented games to go with the poem . <p> Before we knew it , the school year had ended , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . She picked and sold berries , chopped cotton , chopped corn and picked cotton . She earned enough money to buy some clothes from the store to coordinate with the ones Mama had made . She had several new pairs of shoes . She was to leave that Saturday evening , along with three other girls - two cousins and a neighbor - to live with Mrs. Hickey . She was the head teacher who had arranged for the transfer of funds from the Crosby school to Wheatley High School in Houston to pay for their schooling . The girls would live with Mrs. Hickey and her husband . <p> All these special arrangements were necessary because the town of Barrett 's Station , where we lived , had no high school . The nearby town of Crosby , where white folks lived , had a high school , but blacks never went there . <p> Mama had prepared a feast for Miss Addie 's leaving . The table was set with the Sunday tablecloth , dishes and silverware . <p> Miss Addie was packed and ready to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mama sent Pelton and me to find her . <p> " " Life for me ai n't been no crystal stair . It 's had tacks in it , and splinters " Miss Addie was acting out her favorite poem about the mother who was describing her hard life filled with stumbling blocks and hard knocks . But she 'd get up and keep climbing those stairs , " " ... going in the dark Where there ai n't been no light . " For the first time , it did n't seem right for us to be listening to Miss Addie . " " Do n't you turn back . Do n't you set down ' Cause you finds it 's kinder hard . " Pelton and I crept back up the hill . " " I'se still goin ' I'se still climbing " " " Addie ! " Pelton shouted . " " Mama said come on ! Dinner 's ready ! " <p> " " And life for me ai n't been no crystal stair ! " Miss Addie finished , as she struck out running for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wheatley High School , we 'd get letters about her life in the world of higher education . Daddy would sit on the front porch on Sunday with his cronies and brag about what wondrous things Miss Addie was doing . Pelton and I would lurk around the corner of the porch to hear the prideful tellings . <p> Pretty soon Miss Addie did n't come home in the summer to work in the fields . She 'd get summer jobs in the city , and as Uncle Porter said , " " When you get a good education , you do n't have to slave in hot fields all day . Why , the sky 's the limit . " <p> When Miss Addie was in high school , it went to only the 11th grade . After two years of high school , she told Daddy about college . He would have to pay tuition . Daddy always called it paying " " Addie 's Issue . " <p> One Christmas when Addie came home , she was loaded with fine gifts for the whole family . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mama was worried about where a young girl would get so much money . Daddy questioned Miss Addie at length . She said she was working nights at a place called Hughes Tools . Daddy knew about Howard Hughes , about how rich he was , and was proud for Miss Addie to be working for such an important man . <p> Miss Addie assured Daddy that she was still in school . She was going year-round and would graduate from college in a year and a half . She would be an English teacher . The best news was that Daddy would n't have to pay any more tuition . <p> One day we got a letter from Miss Addie . It had a check made out to Daddy . It was for $ 50 . Miss Addie had finished college and had started teaching English at Carver High School in a place called Acres Homes in Houston . Daddy did n't wait for Sunday . He went to Cousin Tobe 's store and showed the check around . All of Barrett 's Station was proud of Miss Addie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Pelton and I were in the fifth grade now , and she wanted to share in the educational experience her children should have . She told Daddy to fix it . <p> " " When Addie was 13 , she left home . When she was 16 , she went to college . When she was 19 , she started teaching . She never had a childhood . You go up there and tell those white folks to put a high school down here for my children . I want to be here when they sing in the choir , when they act in plays . I want to finish raising my own children , and if those folk up in Crosby do n't build a school down here , our young ones are going to go to high school up there with their kids ! " Mama stood her ground . <p> Daddy talked to the other men , and they all agreed . They wrote letters to J.W. Edgar , the man in Austin who was in charge of schools , and when Pelton and I finished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of Barrett 's Station . <p> We named it Charles R. Drew . We had school songs . We had cheerleaders , football teams and yearbooks ; we invited our teachers to dinner . School was wonderful . <p> Miss Addie taught English for 38 years , then retired and started the Barrett 's Station Scholarship Foundation , which helps fund the college education of Barrett kin . Miss Addie still administers the foundation . <p> Since the day Miss Addie became the first Barrett to finish the eighth grade , many have followed the trail she blazed . <p> There are doctors , businessmen , lawyers , insurance executives , dietitians , educators , engineers and businesswomen with nearly every kind of degree there is , from some of the nation 's and the world 's most prestigious colleges and universities . <p> But as Miss Addie foretold all those years ago in Langston Hughes ' poem , " " Life for us ai n't been no crystal stair .
