A Series of Unfortunate Events : The Bad Beginning Movie Tie-in Edition If you are interested in stories with happy endings , you would be better off reading some other book . In this book , not only is there no happy ending , there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle . This is because not very many happy things happened in the lives of the three Baudelaire youngsters . Violet , Klaus , and Sunny Baudelaire were intelligent children , and they were charming , and resourceful , and had pleasant facial features , but they were extremely unlucky , and most everything that happened to them was rife with misfortune , misery , and despair . I 'm sorry to tell you this , but that is how the story goes . Their misfortune began one day at Briny Beach . The three Baudelaire children lived with their parents in an enormous mansion at the heart of a dirty and busy city , and occasionally their parents gave them permission to take a rickety trolley-the word " rickety , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " likely to collapse " - alone to the seashore , where they would spend the day as a sort of vacation as long as they were home for dinner . This particular morning it was gray and cloudy , which did n't bother the Baudelaire youngsters one bit . When it was hot and sunny , Briny Beach was crowded with tourists and it was impossible to find a good place to lay one 's blanket . On gray and cloudy days , the Baudelaires had the beach to themselves to do what they liked . Violet Baudelaire , the eldest , liked to skip rocks . Like most fourteen-year-olds , she was right-handed , so the rocks skipped farther across the murky water when Violet used her right hand than when she used her left . As she skipped rocks , she was looking out at the horizon and thinking about an invention she wanted to build . Anyone who knew Violet well could tell she was thinking hard , because her long hair was tied up in a ribbon to keep it out of her eyes . Violet had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so her brain was often filled with images of pulleys , levers , and gears , and she never wanted to be distracted by something as trivial as her hair . This morning she was thinking about how to construct a device that could retrieve a rock after you had skipped it into the ocean . Klaus Baudelaire , the middle child , and the only boy , liked to examine creatures in tidepools . Klaus was a little older than twelve and wore glasses , which made him look intelligent . He was intelligent . The Baudelaire parents had an enormous library in their mansion , a room filled with thousands of books on nearly every subject . Being only twelve , Klaus of course had not read all of the books in the Baudelaire library , but he had read a great many of them and had retained a lot of the information from his readings . He knew how to tell an alligator from a crocodile . He knew who killed Julius Caesar . And he knew much about the tiny , slimy animals found at Briny Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youngest , liked to bite things . She was an infant , and very small for her age , scarcely larger than a boot . What she lacked in size , however , she made up for with the size and sharpness of her four teeth . Sunny was at an age where one mostly speaks in a series of unintelligible shrieks . Except when she used the few actual words in her vocabulary , like " bottle , " " mommy , " and " bite , " most people had trouble understanding what it was that Sunny was saying . For instance , this morning she was saying " Gack ! " over and over , which probably meant , " Look at that mysterious figure emerging from the fog ! " Sure enough , in the distance along the misty shore of Briny Beach there could be seen a tall figure striding toward the Baudelaire children . Sunny had already been staring and shrieking at the figure for some time when Klaus looked up from the spiny crab he was examining , and saw it too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out of her inventing thoughts . " Look at that , " Klaus said , and pointed toward the figure . It was drawing closer , and the children could see a few details . It was about the size of an adult , except its head was tall , and rather square . " What do you think it is ? " Violet asked . " I do n't know , " Klaus said , squinting at it , " but it seems to be moving right toward us . " " We 're alone on the beach , " Violet said , a little nervously . " There 's nobody else it could be moving toward . " She felt the slender , smooth stone in her left hand , which she had been about to try to skip as far as she could . She had a sudden thought to throw it at the figure , because it seemed so frightening . " It only seems scary , " Klaus said , as if reading his sister 's thoughts , " because of all the mist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the children saw with relief that it was not anybody frightening at all , but somebody they knew : Mr. Poe . Mr. Poe was a friend of Mr. and Mrs. Baudelaire 's whom the children had met many times at dinner parties . One of the things Violet , Klaus , and Sunny really liked about their parents was that they did n't send their children away when they had company over , but allowed them to join the adults at the dinner table and participate in the conversation as long as they helped clear the table . The children remembered Mr. Poe because he always had a cold and was constantly excusing himself from the table to have a fit of coughing in the next room . Mr. Poe took off his top hat , which had made his head look large and square in the fog , and stood for a moment , coughing loudly into a white handkerchief . Violet and Klaus moved forward to shake his hand and say how do you do . " How do you do ? " said Violet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Odo yow ! " said Sunny . " Fine , thank you , " said Mr. Poe , but he looked very sad . For a few seconds nobody said anything , and the children wondered what Mr. Poe was doing there at Briny Beach , when he should have been at the bank in the city , where he worked . He was not dressed for the beach . " It 's a nice day , " Violet said finally , making conversation . Sunny made a noise that sounded like an angry bird , and Klaus picked her up and held her . " Yes , it is a nice day , " Mr. Poe said absently , staring out at the empty beach . " I 'm afraid I have some very bad news for you children . " The three Baudelaire siblings looked at him . Violet , with some embarrassment , felt the stone in her left hand and was glad she had not thrown it at Mr. Poe . " Your parents , " Mr. Poe said , " have perished in a terrible fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They perished , " Mr. Poe said , " in a fire which destroyed the entire house . I 'm very , very sorry to tell you this , my dears . " Violet took her eyes off Mr. Poe and stared out at the ocean . Mr. Poe had never called the Baudelaire children " my dears " before . She understood the words he was saying but thought he must be joking , playing a terrible joke on her and her brother and sister . " ' Perished , ' " Mr. Poe said , " means ' killed . ' " " We know what the word ' perished ' means , " Klaus said , crossly . He did know what the word " perished " meant , but he was still having trouble understanding exactly what it was that Mr. Poe had said . It seemed to him that Mr. Poe must somehow have misspoken . " The fire department arrived , of course , " Mr. Poe said , " but they were too late . The entire house was engulfed in fire . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books in the library , going up in flames . Now he 'd never read all of them.Mr . Poe coughed several times into his handkerchief before continuing . " I was sent to retrieve you here , and to take you to my home , where you 'll stay for some time while we figure things out . I am the executor of your parents ' estate . That means I will be handling their enormous fortune and figuring out where you children will go . When Violet comes of age , the fortune will be yours , but the bank will take charge of it until you are old enough . " Although he said he was the executor , Violet felt like Mr. Poe was the executioner . He had simply walked down the beach to them and changed their lives forever . " Come with me , " Mr. Poe said , and held out his hand . In order to take it , Violet had to drop the stone she was holding .
