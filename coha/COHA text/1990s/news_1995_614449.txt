<p> This was n't supposed to happen until late next month . But Eddie Murray , who entered the weekend on a 2-for-19 slump , is having his first .300 season in five years and the schedule has been moved up . And what should be surprising about that for a player who confounds the game every few years ? <p> In his prime as an Oriole , a relic when with the Dodgers , on his way out as a Met , Murray has all but begun anew as an Indian , defying his age ( 39 ) as he becomes the 20th player to reach 3,000 hits . He was first projected at season 's start to make it in late July but , batting .308 going into Saturday 's game , the forecast has changed ( he hit .254 last year ) . Now Cleveland , with Dave Winfield , will have two members of the 3,000 club in the clubhouse . <p> " I never dreamed I 'd play as long as I have , " Murray said as the season started . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never thought I 'd do some of the things I 've done . " <p> And still does . As the homer-crazy Tribe opened a weekend series in Chicago , Murray had nine home runs , 38 RBI , hitting .356 as a designated hitter , hitting .383 with men on base and has even stolen a base . His career average with the bases loaded remains .416 . He has rung up 1,463 hits since he turned 30 in 1986 . He has hit home runs in 31 major league parks , needing only to knock one out of the new Comiskey Park or the Skydome to break a most-stadiums record . <p> " My consistency is something I 'm most proud of , because that 's what this game is all about . Going out every day and trying to produce , " he said . <p> After the 3,000th , next up is a shot at the 500-100 club . Murray has 101 stolen bases and is 33 home runs short of 500 . Only seven players have gone 500-100 - Henry Aaron , Babe Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reggie Jackson and Mickey Mantle . All are in Cooperstown , except Schmidt , who goes in this summer . Murray will make the trip too , but only after he slows down long enough to retire . <p> WHEN YOU SAY BUDWEISER : It will be a while before the smell goes away in St. Louis , where in the space of one day the club 's cleanup hitter was traded and the manager fired . The dumping of Joe Torre , which may have been unavoidable by season 's end , came after the Cardinals had entered their best stretch of the season ( 4-1 ) . But his sacking may have been part of a palace intrigue , where Anheuser-Busch corporate types used Torre to hide the mishandling of Todd Zeile 's contract . <p> The tale dates back to the first week of the season , when Zeile and agent Seth Levinson say they reached a handshake agreement with GM Walt Jocketty on a new $ 12-million contract that would keep him in St. Louis for three years . A formal announcement would come later . Zeile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said he and Jocketty shook on it and then plunked down some money on a new house in the area . <p> Levinson : " We negotiated a deal with Walt and I believe the plug was pulled above Walt 's head . read : president Mark Lamping or more accurately Anheuser-Busch and August A. Busch III . I really believe Walt was sincere in his dealings with me . Walt felt as strongly as I did that a deal had been struck . " <p> Zeile , incensed , turned down a one-year offer , filed a grievance with MLB Players Association and then on the day he was to go to arbitration let go with the story of the withdrawn contract . Scrambling Cardinals brass moved to cover themselves with the hasty Chicago deal for Mike Morgan ( career record : 97-139 ) and then fired Torre to deflect some of the heat . The hitch : Zeile drop his grievance before he signed a new deal with the Cubs . The Cardinals front office , which in past months has lost free agents Bob Tewskbury and Gregg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Levinson said , " When this whole thing fell apart , I said to Jocketty , ' Maybe you 're too honorable and too decent to be with this organization . ' " <p> Torre knows more than he 's saying but he 's gone fishing . And Joe Torre does not fish . <p> WHO ARE THOSE GUYS ? : This is what the Phillies just went through . Jefferies , center fielder Lenny Dykstra , first baseball Dave Hollins and reliever Toby Borland are all on the disabled list . Ex-Brave outfielder Dave Gallagher is playing with a bad hamstring while outfielder Tony Longmire is slowed with a groin pull . New property Andy Van Slyke , already on the DL twice this year , nearly missed a third trip with a bruised chest after sliding hard into second Wednesday night . The club has already used five different center fielders . If three of their most effective pitchers - Michael Mimbs , Ricky Bottalico and Tyler Green - were n't in Reading last year , they were in Scranton . <p> But while the Braves went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased their NL East lead from four to five games . Scheduling helped . The Phils are in the midst of a Marlins-Mets-Cardinals stretch and began the weekend on a six-game win streak . And their timing now appears impeccable . When the Braves visit Veterans Stadium next weekend , Dykstra , Hollins and Van Slyke all should be back in the lineup . <p> AROUND THE LEAGUE <p> San Francisco agreed to help the Yankees with some of Darryl Strawberry 's contract , though the player dropped his grievance over how the Giants withdrew an arbitration offer last year . Some $ 125,000 of Straw Man 's $ 850,000 salary will come from the Giants . Said managing partner Peter Magowan , " It was n't a significant amount . We figured we saved legal costs . " <p> - Texas rookie shortstop Benji Gil is out-polling Juan Gonzalez , Will Clark and even former Ranger Jose Canseco in the All-Star vote . " I have a big family , " Gil said . " But not that big . " <p> - Ex- Brave and former Richmond manager Chris Chambliss had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dusty Baker . He declined . " I look forward to managing in the majors , but now obviously is not the time . Joe Torre is the reason I 'm here . It 's probably not my place to manage here right now . " <p> - The managerial change in Chicago has n't done anything to stir the White Sox and GM Ron Schueler has begun traveling everywhere with the club because opponents keep saying the Chisox are quitting dogs . Said California pitcher Chuck Finley after beating them in Anaheim , " After the first inning , I felt like those guys were ready to roll over and die . I 've been on the other end of that and it 's not pretty . You can almost tell by their body language . They were just trying to get through the day . " <p> - Houston closer John Hudek 's stock has fallen as quickly as it rose last year . Over his past eight outings entering the weekend , he had yielded 13 hits and 11 earned runs in his past 7 2/3 innings ( 12.91 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high 80s . <p> - Before the Braves ' first visit to Coors Field , Colorado was 5-0 against left-handers , who had allowed 40 runs in 40 2/3 innings . The Braves threw Tom Glavine , Steve Avery , Kent Mercker and Pedro Borbon at them , followed by Florida 's Chris Hammond and the Rockies turned themselves around , scoring five runs in 31 1/3 innings and going 0-4 . <p> - Quick quiz : Who are Stephen Mintz , Ken Greer , Chris Hook , Enrique Burgos and Shawn Barton ? A : The rest of the Giants bullpen after Rod Beck and Dave Burba . It may be a few days . It may be a few hours . But it will be soon that Cleveland 's Eddie Murray becomes the 20th player to reach 3,000 hits . Murray is already in several unique clubs . He is one of 10 players with 100 stolen bases and 450 home runs . He has played more games at first base than anyone else . But he has also spawned another club : those who served him milestone hits . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hit No ... Date ... Opponent ... Pitcher 1 ... April 7 , 1977 ... Texas ...
