Jan first heard wolves howling in the streets of Manhattan on the night of the blackout . <p> It was two in the morning , but Jan was awake . She had been lying in bed watching the all-news cable station on TV . For the third time that night , a well-dressed newscaster was telling her about a sniper in a Miami shopping mall . Distraught over his divorce , the man had opened fire with a rifle , picking off six women shoppers and a saleslady before the police apprehended him . The blackout cut the announcer off in mid-sentence . <p> Just before the lights went out , Jan had been crying . A month before , Dennis , her husband , had said that he wanted a divorce , and that unexpected event had shattered the rhythms of her life . " I 'm leaving , " he had said . And then he said many other things  --  about finding himself , about feeling trapped , about being confused , about love . But of that storm of words only two had stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , since the condominium that they shared belonged to him , she had been the one to leave , subletting an apartment in the Village from a friend who was vacationing in Florida . Jan lived out of a suitcase and fed her friend 's two cats , who regarded her as a convenient source of food and no more . The cats prowled around her bed and on her bed , pouncing on her feet when she shifted position and staring at her in the flickering light of the television . <p> After Jan had left her husband , she realized that she had forgotten how to sleep . She found herself sitting up late at night , watching TV . Sometimes she drank brandy to put herself in a drifting hazy state from which she could nod off . Sometimes the murmur of the television lulled her to sleep . But she always slept badly . <p> On the night that the lights went out , Jan sat for a moment in the darkness , then got out of bed and went to the window to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was when she heard the wolves . <p> First , the sound of distant barking  --  maybe someone 's dog disturbed by the sudden darkness . Then the animal began to howl , starting low and rising slowly to a high-pitched wailing note . Others joined in with wavering voices , each on a slightly different pitch . <p> No lights shone in the surrounding buildings . The streetlights were out . Moonlight glistened on the fire escape outside her window , reflected from the empty windows of the apartment building across the way . <p> Jan opened the window and listened . A trick of the wind , she thought . But the howling rose and fell in a chorus that was unrelated to the wind . Wolves in the streets of Manhattan . She shivered and closed the window . <p> When she dialed 911 , a woman 's voice answered . <p> " There are wolves in the street , " Jan said . " I can hear them howling . " <p> " What is the nature of your 911 emergency ? " the woman asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolves howling " Jan repeated . " Not far away . " <p> " Noisy dogs do not constitute an emergency , " the woman said briskly . " Contact Animal Control during normal business hours . " <p> " But I can hear . . . . " Jan was speaking to the dial tone . <p> She hung up and listened at the window again . The wind sang through the latticework of the fire escape and a taxi passed by in the street below . Again she heard howling a little nearer now . <p> She hesitated , then dialed her husband 's number . She imagined him fumbling for the telephone on the bedside table , his eyes half-closed , his body naked under the covers . She imagined the click as he switched on the bedside light , a brass lamp that she had bought at an antique shop a few months ago . She was reassured just by the sound of his sleepy hello . <p> She said nothing . Since she left him , she had called him every now and then  --  maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to talk to him ; she only wanted to hear his voice . Each time , she swore she would not call him again , but her resolve always failed . <p> " Hello , " he said again . She listened to the sound of his breathing , but she did not speak . What would she tell him ? The power was out . Wolves were howling in the street . What would he say ? He would tell her that she was just letting her imagination mn away with her . He would tell her not to call . It was best just to listen to his voice , visualizing the bedroom that she had once thought of as her own . <p> " Who the hell is this ? " he demanded . " God damn it , will you say something ? " Finally he swore and slammed down the phone . The dial tone returned . She hung up the phone and returned to the window . She could no longer hear the wolves . <p> She lit the candle that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrapped herself in a blanket and lay down to listen for howling on the wind . She was still awake when the power returned at four o'clock and the television came to life . A talk show was on and a psychologist was discussing stress . " Inability to sleep is one symptom of stress , " he was saying . Jan fell asleep , listening to him chatter . <p> She slept through her alarm the next morning and woke up half an hour late , groggy from lack of sleep . The candle had burned itself out and an " I Love Lucy " rerun was on . The cats yowled at her and she dumped dry cat food in their dish . Hurriedly , she dressed and walked four blocks to the subway station . As she walked , her breath made clouds of steam in the cold air . <p> The temperature in the subway station was tropical , the humid air heavy with pungent odors . The advertisements that hung on the white tiled walls had been decorated with spray paint in jungle colors : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plumage of exotic birds . <p> As Jan waited for her train , she noticed an old woman wandering down the platform , peering into the face of each commuter she passed . The woman wore a man 's overcoat and sculled black shoes . Her hair , as gray and tangled as rag paper stuffing spilled from beneath her knit cap . In one hand , she carried a pink plastic shopping bag crammed full of clothing . As she drew near , Jan could hear her muttering to herself . Jan looked away , pretending great interest in the advertisement across the way . <p> The smiling woman in a cigarette ad had been artfully disfigured by a graffiti artist : her ears were slightly point ed and tipped with tufts of fur ; her smile had been subtly altered  --  the teeth sharpened with a careful touch of paint . <p> " They come out at night , " the old woman said , stepping between Jan and the advertisement . " Out of the dark . " The woman 's eyes were the muddy brown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her hands moved in an uneven rhythm that was unrelated to her words . She glanced down suddenly , as if startled by the movement of her own hands . There was a smear of red spray paint on the cement at her feet and she stared at it fixedly . " Blood of the beast , " she said and then she lifted her eyes and regarded Jan with an unnerving smile . <p> " It 's just paint , " Jan said . <p> The old woman shook her head and continued smiling . Though she had not asked for money , Jan fumbled in the bottom of her purse for change and spilled her findings into the woman 's hand : a crumpled dollar bill , a quarter , a couple of dimes . <p> The woman 's eyes lingered on Jan 's face . " They come out at night and no one knows where they go , " she muttered dreamily . Her smile grew broader , a wide unthinking grin . " No one knows . " She laughed , a high brittle sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jan backed away from the woman and the rumble of an approaching train drowned out the laughter . Jan fled on the train . When she looked back through the steamy window , the old woman waved and Jan looked away . <p> Jan had a temporary position in a legal office , typing endless briefs into a word processor . She worked in a small windowless cubicle at the back of the office . Through the cubicle 's open door , she could see men in suits hurry up and down the hall on their way to meetings . She typed , letting the words flow through her without touching her as they passed . She ate lunch alone , sitting by the window of the coffee shop and trying to think of nothing . She made it through the day . <p> That evening she met her friend Marsha after work . Jan and Marsha had attended the same small college in upstate New York . Jan had called Marsha when Dennis first said he was leaving . After Jan moved out , Marsha had insisted on getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a divorce and she said she knew what Jan was going through . Marsha bullied Jan to a certain extent , but Jan tolerated that with good grace : she liked the flamboyant dark-haired woman . <p> She met Marsha at an Italian restaurant . Marsha , who was perpetually dieting , ordered pasta , then agonized over her decision . " You 'll have to eat half of it , " she told Jan . " You must have dropped ten pounds since you left Dennis . You 're so lucky . " Marsha regarded any weight loss as fortunate , whatever the cause . <p> " I have n't been hungry lately , " Jan said . <p> " I can always eat , " Marsha claimed . " Especially when I 'm miserable . " <p> Jan shook her head . " I just do n't feel like eating . " <p> Marsha studied Jan 's face . " You 've got to get your mind off him . Get out and do things . Meet new people . " <p> " I do n't think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really a lie . She lay awake at night not thinking her mind filled with white noise . She did not think about anything . <p> Jan drank too much red wine and listened to Marsha 's heartfelt advice . After a few bites of pasta she felt nauseous , but the wine eased the tension that knotted her stomach . The wine made talking easier , shrinking the world to an intimate circle that included only her , Marsha , and the waiter who refilled their glasses . <p> " I ca n't sleep at night , " Jan told Marsha . " I hear sounds in the street . " <p> " What kind of sounds ? " <p> Jan hesitated , then plunged ahead . " The other night , I heard wolves howling . " <p> " A neighbor was probably watching a horror movie on TV , " Marsha said . " That 's all . " <p> " There was a blackout , " Jan said stubbornly . " No TV . " <p> " Then it was teenagers howling under your window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You hear all kinds of weird stuff in New York at night . Nothing to worry about . " <p> Jan fidgeted with her wine glass . " I 'm afraid all the time . All the time . In the apartment at night ; in the subway ; when I 'm walking to work . All the time . " <p> Marsha reached across the table to pat Jan 's hand . " It 's hard to get used to being alone . " <p> Jan noticed that her hand was in a fist , and she made an effort to relax . " Things are out of control , " she said softly . " I do n't know what 's going on anymore . I do n't know who I am . When Dennis was with me , I did n't worry . Now I worry all the time . " <p> " You 're spending too much time alone , " Marsha said . " I 'll tell you what  --  I 'm going to an art show on Thursday night . The artist is a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening will be fun . We can both get dressed to the teeth . Why do n't you come with me ? " <p> Jan shook her head . " I do n't have anything to wear . I left most of my clothes at the condominium . I escaped with one suitcase and my life . " She tried to laugh , but it sounded wrong . <p> " You can borrow one of my dresses . I have a great little basic black number that will fit you just fine . " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " We 're going " Marsha said . " And that 's that . " <p> It was late when they finally called for the check . Outside the restaurant , snow was falling  --  great flakes that drifted lazily down and melted when they hit the pavement . Marsha hailed a cab . At first , she insisted that Jan take it , but for once Jan prevailed . " You take it  --  I 'll catch another . " Marsha acquiesced at last , and Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad of the cold air on her face . Another taxi passed , but she did not hail it . She wanted , for reasons that were not clear to her , to take the subway . Neon signs were lit and the colors reflected from the wet asphalt , making glistening streams of color . She liked the darkness and the cold and the neon red reflections that ran like blood on the street . <p> The subway entrance was marked with tall old-fashioned green-tinted streetlights . A straight-backed woman dressed in Salvation Army blue was standing by the stairs , handing out leaflets . Without thinking Jan accepted a leaflet and hurried down the grimy stairs into a hallway that stank of urine . <p> Only a few people were waiting on the platform . A teenager in a dirty denim jacket lounged against one of the pillars . A bag lady lay on a wooden bench , her head cushioned on a shopping bag filled with old clothes . An elderly man sat at the end of the bench , resting his head in his hands . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken : bits of glass glittered in the rubbish that had accumulated near the station 's tiled wall . Another light had burned out . The platform was filled with shadows . <p> Jan stood with her back to one of the pillars by the tracks , staring into the darkness from which the train would emerge . The wine had filled her head with a humming that would not stop . Though she waited here each day for the train home from work , the station seemed unfamiliar . She found herself staring at the graffiti on the walls , trying to puzzle out the meaning of the illegible words . On a level that she did not want to acknowledge , she felt that the scrawled letters held a message for her . The graffiti shifted and moved before her eyes . <p> In the dim light , her hearing seemed exceptionally keen . She heard the crackle of paper as the bag lady shifted her head on her shopping-bag pillow , the rasp of a match as the teenager lit a cigarette , the hoarse whisper of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something , but she caught only a few words . <p> " . . . safe in the tunnels , " he murmured . " . . . warm and dark . . . " <p> Jan glanced at him , but he was talking to no one . His head was in his hands and he was staring fixedly at the tracks . She turned away , keeping her back to the pillar . <p> " . . . ca n't find us here , " sighed another voice . Jan glanced back and saw the bag lady shift on her bench . <p> Another voice , just as soft , joined the bag lady 's muttering . " We come out at night , " the teenager said . <p> Jan pressed her back to the pillar . She did not look around . The station was filled with whispering voices that ebbed and flowed like wind in the trees . She caught fragments of sentences  --  or did she imagine the words . <p> " . . . place to hide , " the bag lady said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " whispered the man . <p> Jan heard the distant rumble of a train and stared into the darkness , watching for the first glow of the headlight . <p> " . . . good hunting " murmured the teenager . <p> The train pulled into the station and Jan flung herself into an empty car . Harsh light shone on molded plastic seats and graffiti-decorated walls ; there was a faint smell of old cigarette butts and piss . Through the dirty glass of the window , Jan looked back at the platform . The teenager smiled as the train pulled away . <p> Jan sat on the plastic seat and blinked at the darkness that rushed past the windows . An unintelligible voice announced the coming station . She rocked with the motion of the train . <p> The train pulled into a station . The doors opened and closed . The train was pulling out when she saw a poster on the station wall . " MARK OF THE WOLF , " it said , but the words flashed past the train and were gone before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass , but saw only darkness . Beyond the glass , she thought , there is no world . Just darkness . She could imagine any world she chose  --  any world . She closed her eyes and thought about the world she would create . In the darkness of her mind , wolves ran through the darkened tunnel , keeping pace with the train . <p> She opened her eyes as the train slowed for the next station . Lights appeared outside the window , creating a new world of glistening tile and advertisements . She did not see any posters that said " MARK OF THE WOLF , " but she got off the train and caught an uptown train to the station she had passed . <p> She could not find the poster though she walked up and down the empty platform , staring at each advertisement . After the train pulled out , the only sound in the station was the tapping of her footsteps . The tunnels stretched away into the darkness . Anything could hide there . <p> She felt her heart beating quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear or excitement . When she closed her eyes , she could feel the air pressing close around her , warm and filled with unidentifiable smells . She lingered in the shadows at the far end of the platform , staring into the tunnel and breathing in the aroma of the darkness . She found herself listening , straining her ears to hear something . She did not know what she was listening for . From the direction of the turnstile , she heard footsteps , and she glanced back toward the brightly lit section of the platform . <p> The colors were gone from the advertisements , the benches , the graffiti on the walls . The scene was painted in black and white and shades of gray . She blinked , wondering if this were some trick of the light . <p> " Hey , lady , " called the guard . He stood under the light , his feet set slightly apart , his head tilted at an aggressive angle . " What 're you doing there ? " <p> " Waiting " she said , not moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform , " he said . " None of that here . " <p> She watched him . His face was shiny with sweat and she could smell his fear . " Who comes out at night ? " she asked him . <p> " What ? " <p> " Who comes out at night ? " <p> He said nothing . The train came and she got on . She stared out at the darkness and imagined a new world , constructing it from the shades of night . <p> That night , she felt restless . The borrowed apartment was not her home . Her clothes were still in her suitcase : she had never unpacked . The closet and the bureau drawers were filled with her friend 's clothes . Jan was temporary , a transient guest who would come and go without leaving a trace of her passage . She did not belong here . <p> In the pocket of her coat , she found the flier that the Salvation Army woman had thrust into her hand . It was badly printed on cheap stock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The text was littered with exclamation points and loud with religious exhortations : " DOOMSDAY IS NEAR ! Behold ! Beware ! Be Watchful ! Satan 's evil dominion is rampant . You must choose between light and darkness . Do not go down into the darkness without Jesus in your heart . Let Jesus be the torch that lights your way . ARE WE MEN OR ARE WE BEASTS ? Accept the Lord into your heart and renounce the ways of the beast . " <p> Yes , she thought , they dwell in darkness . The tunnels are dark and very private . <p> At three that morning , she called Dennis . She stood at the window , looking out as she listened to the phone ring . In the glass , she could see her own reflection . Her eyes were enormous ; her pupils dilated . Outside , it was snowing . The phone rang twenty times before he finally picked it up . She did not speak , but listened as he swore into the receiver . His voice did not reassure her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She hung up and listened to the wolves howling in the street , a chorus of keening voices raised to serenade the waxing moon . She opened the window to let the sound enter the apartment . <p> The cats watched her nervously . The howling sang in her blood , agonizingly sweet and piercingly high , rising and falling like the wind . She paced to and fro in the tiny apartment , and the cats stared at her . The larger of the two followed her , meowing as he twined between her legs . At last , tired of his persistence , she throttled him , closing her hands around his throat softly , then applying pressure . It seemed , in that moment , like the right thing to do . The dying animal struggled , but she did not release her hold . She put the warm body in the kitchen trash . The other cat hid beneath the bed and made no sound , <p> That night , she turned down the sound on the television . She lay awake and listened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets , to race through the night toward some unknown goal . In the darkness of the room that was not hers , she smiled , thinking of the subway tunnels where secret creatures lived . <p> The next morning , she found paw prints in the snow beneath her window . The snow had melted in most places , but on the sidewalk beneath Jan 's window , there was a patch that had lingered . The first set of prints was joined by another , and then by a third . For half a block , she followed them . Then the paw prints were obliterated by the footprints of commuters , and she went down the subway stairs alone . <p> On the side of the train that took her to work , someone had painted a running wolf . Gray and black , with slashes of red for the eyes . She boarded that car and puzzled over the graffiti on her way to work . If she squinted , she thought she could almost read it  --  not read the letters perhaps , but figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something about freedom and pain . <p> Marsha bustled around the studio apartment , fixing coffee and talking about the art opening . Jan sat on the couch , watching the snow fall outside . The apartment smelled faintly of perfume and powder . <p> " You just do n't give yourself a chance , " Marsha said . " You need to explore . Experiment . Really let yourself go wild . " <p> Jan studied the coffee in her cup . The cream formed white swirls , like hurricanes viewed from space . " I 'm thinking of going away , " she told Marsha . <p> Her friend was rummaging in the closet , looking for the dress she wanted Jan to wear . " Going where ? " <p> Jan shrugged . " Away . " <p> " I could use a vacation myself , " Marsha said . " Bermuda maybe ? Ah , here it is ! " She pulled a black dress from the closet . " I bought it on sale . I 've been trying to diet . down a size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> At Marsha 's insistence , Jan put on the dress . Marsha put up Jan 's hair and applied eye liner and shadow to her eyes . " You ca n't look until I 'm done . Oh , you look so good . " <p> Jan was startled by her reflection in the mirror . Her eyes had a faintly carnivorous look . Her lips were red  --  Marsha 's choice of lipstick . <p> They took a cab to the gallery . Staring out the window , Jan saw the reflected image of her own face : red lips , dark eyes . She listened to the hiss of the cab 's tires against the wet pavement . She was cold  --  the fur wrap that Marsha had loaned her was for show , not warmth  --  but the cold was a distant feeling somehow unreal . She liked the feel of the fur against her shoulders . <p> The gallery was warm and crowded . She drank a glass of white wine  --  then another . She lost track of Marsha in the crowd and wandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images were dark and violent : a tattooed man with the head of a dog ; a group of punks i n the subway , their eyes glowing in the dim light ; a naked woman running down a dark street , her body silver in the moonlight , her shadow twisted and misshapen . Jan shivered when she saw that one , but she studied it for a long time while people moved past her , chatting about the artist 's painterly technique , his use of mythic themes . <p> She met the artist when she was getting her third glass of wine . He was a tall , dark-haired man who talked in a low voice about art and life . " There are people who live on the surface of life , never seeing beyond the illusions of daily existence . Then there are some who see past the sham . Those are the people who see the truth in my work . " <p> He leaned close as he spoke and let his hand rest softly , as if by accident , on her bare shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she had wanted to tell Marsha . She was considering telling him about the wolves when Dennis interrupted the conversation . <p> " Jan ? " Dennis said . " I did n't expect to see you here . I almost did n't recognize you . " <p> She studied him for a moment . His eyes looked bleary and his shirt needed ironing . His voice was too loud , and she guessed that the glass of wine in his hand was not his first . She smiled without warmth and introduced him to the artist as her ex-husband . The artist did not remove his hand from her shoulder . <p> " I 've been trying to call you , " Dennis said . " Seems like you 're never home . " <p> She shrugged . She did not tell him that she was often home . In the last week , she had chosen to stop answering the phone . She preferred to let it ring while she gazed out the window into the night . <p> " Dennis ! " Marsha 's voice cut through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , intent on rescuing Jan from an awkward situation . " Since when have you been interested in art ? " <p> Jan listened to their conversation and watched them as she had watched the falling snow . She was separated from them by a pane of glass . Marsha waved a hand on which ivory bangles rattled and Jan heard the noise from a great distance . <p> In the cab ride home , Marsha said , " Oh , he was eating his heart out . He was . What do you want to bet you 'll be heating from him ? " <p> " Jan ? " said Dennis ' voice . He had caught her at work , where she had to answer the phone . " I thought maybe . . . It was good seeing you last night . Would you like to go out to dinner sometime ? I 'd like to talk . " <p> " Talk ? " Her voice felt rough and unused . She had not slept the night before , and that morning , when she dressed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Dennis was saying something . " . . . know you must think I 'm a jerk , but I miss you . I do n't know . When I saw you last night , I guess I realized . . . . " <p> He went on and she stared at the blank wall of her cubicle , thinking of nothing . <p> " How about tonight ? " he asked . " I could meet you after work . " <p> " All right , " she said . " Tonight . " <p> " I 've changed since you left me , " she told him over dinner . He did n't seem to understand . He seemed clumsier than she remembered him , more awkward . <p> One thing led to another : dinner to drinks , drinks to her borrowed apartment . He came up for a nightcap . She hoped that he would not look in the kitchen trash where the body of the cat still lay , curled as if asleep . <p> The bed creaked beneath their weight as they made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she did not like the way he smelled . His hair and skin smelled of soap and skin lotion , a sweet clean scent that she found disturbing . His skin was too smooth , too clean . <p> Dennis was asleep when the moon rose , but Jan lay awake . She knew that the moon was rising , she knew it even before the howling began . Her husband slept beside her , his breathing steady and undisturbed . The air in the apartment was stuffy  --  warm and stinking of cats . The distant howling touched her with urgency . <p> She slipped from the bed silently and opened the curtain to let in the light . " I 'm leaving , " she said softly , but Dennis ' soft breathing did not change . <p> She opened the window and stepped out onto the fire escape . She was naked . Her bare feet melted the snow that had settled on the metal platform .

She knew that they were waiting for her to join them . <p> On the fire escape 's last landing , she hesitated , suddenly noticing the gold wedding band on her hand . She took it off and left it balanced on the metal railing . Quietly , without hurrying , she descended to the street .
