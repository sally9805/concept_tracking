MUSIC <P> Made in Her Own Image <P> SASSY , SEXY AND BELTING OUT DISCO anthems like I 'm Every Woman , CHAKA KHAN seemed to embody the feel-good exuberance of the early 1970s . Her recording career has had its up and downs since then , but Khan seems set to zoom back up to those old heights with her latest release , The Woman I Am . The title reflects a new self-determination that goes beyond mere semantics . Taking charge for the first time in her 20-year career , Khan produced the album herself and co-wrote six of its 13 songs , including the title track . Her fiery contralto is in total command on all of them , swooping effortlessly from a raunchy growl to a soulful wail . The result is frisky , hip-shaking music . So go ahead , party hearty . <P> TELEVISION <P> Mental Cruelty <P> WILL THIS MADNESS NEVER END ? ANOTHer ratings " sweeps , " another torrent of tawdry TV movies about women being brutalized  --  physically , mentally , sexually . For sheer masochistic excess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S NAME . Donna Mills plays a woman whose daughter is raped and murdered . The sleazebag is acquitted on an insanity defense so ludicrous that the mental institution where he is sent lets him go . This is too much for Mom to bear , so she tracks down the guy and shoots him  --  then has to stand trial herself . It 's overwrought and unbelievable , but watchable because of Mills , who agonizes beautifully , down to her last unkempt strand of hair . <P> BOOKS <P> America 's God <P> CHUNKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT WERE written by  --  a woman ! So went the sales- boosting claim of Harold Bloom in 1990 's The Book of J. Bloom booms again in the preposterous , opinionated , thoroughly entertaining THE AMERICAN RELIGION ( Simon &; Schuster ; $22 ) . The eminent Yale critic , who sees religion as " spilled poetry , " turns tastemaker on U.S.-made faiths , especially Southern Baptism , where he stumbles badly , and Mormonism , which he lauds for odd originality . Pentecostalism ? " Daring . " New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtitle transmits Bloom 's wish : " The Emergence of the Post- Christian Nation . " Oh , yes . Bloom thinks America 's hidden creed is Gnosticism , and , for the American , god is none other than himself . <P> THEATER <P> Showtime For Hitler <P> CHORUS GIRLS TWIRL AROUND IN HEADdresses a la Busby Berkeley . Gymnasts flex , and one inverts himself into a handstand minutes long . A busty blond croons a pop tune . Then Nazi soldiers march in . No , it 's not Broadway 's Cabaret , but an even more genuine article , staged by Berlin 's Theater des Westens to depict how Hitler 's regime fused popular culture and propaganda . BERLIN CABARET , at Washington 's Kennedy Center through this week , is gloriously mounted if scantily plotted . Its showy numbers evoke radio , pop music and the 1936 Olympics but focus on the movies , especially as seen by a Jewish actor turned exile and a matronly costume aide who deplores patriotic bunkum yet finds celluloid dreams irresistible . <P> CINEMA <P> Blind Trust    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
