Dorcas hated the fens . A no-man's-land once you got beyond the pub , whose cold windowpanes behind her glowed like a row of golden fingerprints , and the only other lights were those of the occasional car moving along the A17 . The endless monotony of the fens was bad enough in daylight , and worse at night because at night it got really spooky . Dorcas kept looking over her shoulder , seeing nothing but a vast black flatness and the tiny lights of the pub . It was a little after eleven o'clock on a cold February night , mid-February it was , that found Dorcas walking across Wyndham Fen . She set her feet down in the sopping field , made spongier by the incessant rains . She should never have worn these heels , inch and a half they were , but they made her legs look ever so much better . She was convinced that there must be quicksand about , despite people 's telling her this was marshy land , the fens , and though it might be soggy and spongy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a first time , she thought . The pub was well behind her , probably a half-mile , its lights still visible . Now they looked as far off as stars , and nothing lay between her and the rim of the sky , black and blank . She especially hated Wyndham Fen because of the tourists who came into the pub and asked stupid questions . It gave her a kick to give them stupid answers sometimes and watch as the puzzlement grew on their faces . It was really a laugh how many tourists were actually eager to be separated from their two or more quid to have the experience of seeing a fen as it used to be hundreds of years ago . God , was n't it bad enough to see it now without pining over what it was ? It was like her own mum poring over old photos , snaps of them all at Skegness , places like that . The dark shape of the Visitors ' Center drifted like a ship on the unsteady ground . The fens lent everything around a curiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spire of a distant church spiked higher , stumps engorged . Bright light would return these objects to their natural shapes , but even in the light of day the overwhelming flatness of the fens could make what appeared in the distance more distant , and at the same time , things that were closer looked closer still . It was as if there was never a time , day or night , when you could depend on the evidence of your own eyes . Her shoes sank in the spongy ground . There was peat beneath the grass and for some reason that always made her feel the ground was not secure . As if the ground itself floated on a raft through fog . The Visitors ' Center was the only building around , so the only place that offered cover . She was making her way to its porch , thinking it a very odd place to choose for a meeting . Why could n't they have just as easily met inside where there was warmth and light ? The only light here was her torch spiking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her right where the boardwalk began to weave its way through the canals , she remembered how she hated water , had done ever since she 'd been left in the tub alone as a tyke and slipped under and almost drowned because her tiny hands could n't get purchase , could n't find anything but slippery enamel -- the very thought made her sick , even now . When the family went to Skegness every summer , she would n't get any closer to the sea than halfway down the strand where she 'd sit with her private hoard of film mags and sexy novels . She 'd taken off the original dust jackets and replaced them with others . They were now entertaining her cloaked as Jane Eyre , Adam Bede , David Copperfield . Mum and Da would think that was what she was reading . " Improving your mind are you , Dorcas ? Good girl , just do n't go getting too smart to get a paying job . Hah hah , " her father would say . Not much of a laugh her father was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the ones some of her friends had . One of these books , David Copperfield it was , she was supposed to have read in school . She never finished it . The boys at the comprehensive seemed to have read Dickens for the sole purpose of taunting poor Dorcas , who had , at age thirteen , already something of a reputation . The boys had quickly put to use a slightly revised version of Barkis 's message to Nurse Peggotty , which became in their mouths : " Dorcas is willin ' , Dorcas is willin ' . " She pretended she could n't be bothered , but the taunt stung , and her reputation gained momentum with no help from Dorcas . The primary reason that Dorcas was willing was because she was n't pretty ; she had nothing that would attract men except for being willing . And that had gone right round the comprehensive like wildfire . Dorcas hated Charles Dickens . For more than twenty years she 'd been inwardly raging about her looks , not one feature she could be proud of except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell a girl he loved her teeth ? Not likely . And her shape did n't make up for her face , either . Lying on the warm sands of Skegness she was painfully aware that the spandex of her bathing suit was girdle-tight and showed the rills and ridges around her middle . Her hair was rusty-red and stiffish , like one of the scouring pads she used for dishes . The only color in her round face came from the freckles that almost covered it . Well , her da could n't accuse her of not working , not with her two jobs , at the house and at the pub . Of course , if he knew why she was working two jobs , would n't he be surprised ? She 'd already got her " going away " outfit : a washed-silk brownish gold suit that made her eyes look more honey-colored than just plain brown -- worse than brown , a silt-color , muddy brown . As she hobbled along the path -- she really should n't have worn these shoes -- she felt the burden of her plain looks lift a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last analysis ; they were not important . She had found someone who could see her inner beauty . For Dorcas had always been convinced that here she shone . She walked up the few steps , her feet killing her , and at the top took off her shoes and knocked off the mud . With shoes dangling from her fingers , she stood and looked out over Wyndham Fen and sighed . Here was history . She thought about that with absolutely no enthusiasm . Back in school she had been forced to go with her classmates to hear a boring lecture about how the fens were drained . And other boring details about the Levels . Did anybody really care except for the people who grew all of those acres of tulips and daffs ? What she was looking out at -- except she could n't see with the torch off -- was what Wyndham Fen had looked like a hundred years before . Or was it a thousand ? How could a person remember all that history ? Then they 'd drained all of the fens -- she was unclear as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No , that was too long ago . That Dutch yob , Vanderbilt ? No , he was that American billionaire . Vander ... Van Der-something ? Anyway , he 'd got this idea one fine day that you could make the fens produce crops and so forth if you went and drained them . This was good news she supposed if you wanted to be a farmer , maybe the dullest job in the world , but there it was , there 's men liked it . Then after they drained the whole of Lincolnshire , nearly , someone else -- the National Trust , she guessed -- got the idea that it would be nice to have at least one of the fens looking the way the fens had looked before . Why , she could n't imagine . So they de-drained this one where the Center was . Flooded it back or something with water . Dorcas stood there with her shoes dangling from her fingers thinking , My God , look at all the trouble for nothing . Bugger all , it was a bigger waste of time even than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring things back the way they were . That was a deep thought for Dorcas , and this pleased her , for she did n't much like thinking . She meant to file it away to repeat when the two of them were talking . He 'd be pleasantly surprised to know he was going to marry a woman who was good in bed and a good cook and a thinker of deep thoughts . She stood in the frigid mid-February air absently humming and wishing another deep thought would come her way . Maybe she should go read David Copperfield again . She wrapped her heavily sweatered arms about her . She chided herself for not wearing a coat because the sweater was prettier and the coat was black and awfully old . She shivered but not from the cold this time . No , she refused to think about the dead woman . She would not think about her , would not name her name , not even in the privacy of her own mind ; she would set her aside . If she were nameless then she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would or would not take care of that ; they 'd talked to everyone at the house , her included , till she was blue in the face . Dorcas hunched her shoulders and huddled down into her heavy sweater and looked out over the dark tangle of trees and tall grasses and canals that was the old fen . She 'd rather save her two quid , ta very much , for her trousseau or a good cookery book . She heard a sound behind her , a creaking board . And then the arms encircled her waist . Romantic was her first thought . Something 's wrong , was her second thought , and she barely had time for the third before she felt the breath being squeezed out of her , not by hands but by a soft , silky thing tightening round her throat . For a few moments she tried to claw it away as she opened her mouth to scream , but there was no voice to do it . Dorcas ai n't willin ' . Dorcas ai n't CHAPTER TWO Chief Inspector Arthur Bannen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but looked ten years younger . His age was as enigmatic as the rest of him . If he resented Scotland Yard 's turning up in Lincolnshire , he did n't show it . He was a man so soft-spoken one might wonder if anything could excite or harrow him . He said what he said with a smile , a small one , even a hurt one sometimes , as if it pained him his listener did n't quite agree . He was presently engaged in folding a length of paper accordion style , like a map . " We have n't asked for your help , Mr. Jury , " said Bannen , finally , but in a perfectly friendly way , while snipping away at the folded paper with his scissors . His feet were up on the edge of his desk , giving the impression of lethargy . Jury thought he was probably anything but lethargic . " I know you do n't need mine . I 'm asking for yours . " They were discussing the murder of a guest who 'd been staying at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bannen started cutting the paper carefully with scissors and , when he turned his attention to Jury , apparently found Jury the less interesting and turned back to his cutting . " I see . Well , then , how can I help you ? " He did n't sound enthusiastic . " From what I 've heard , Lady Kennington 's role in all of this is only -- peripheral . " " If you mean by that she 's on the fringe , or , as they say , out of the loop , ' I 'd say , no , she 's definitely in the loop . " Bannen smiled slightly , as if delivering this news was not unpleasant . He continued cutting tiny triangles out of the paper . " You 're not saying that she 's a suspect , are you ? " Bannen 's eyes were a mild and unengaging shade of gray , the color of the brackish water in the drains Jury had passed on his trip from London . " Everyone 's a suspect who was present at the time . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Use whatever word you like , " Bannen said pleasantly , continuing to snip his design into the strip of paper . " She had opportunity ; she and the Dunn woman were outside when the others were inside the house . Add to that , Jennifer Kennington and Verna Dunn were quarreling . Add to that your friend Lady Kennington was apparently the last to see the victim alive . After she 'd left the Dunn woman , Jennifer Kennington was quite by herself , taking a walk . " He paused , considering . " Or so she says . " He snapped the scissors a few times , like crocodile jaws , and looked coolly at Jury . " Now if you were I , Superintendent , would you place Jennifer Kennington out of the loop ? " Slowly , Bannen shook his head . " I do n't think so . " Snip . * In the dream , Jenny was moving across the fen ; others joined her , forming a procession . He heard the barely audible bells of a censer at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ear . Jury knocked it over groping for it . In his attempt to shake himself from sleep and retrieve it , he felt he was gulping down great droughts of air . His chest hurt , ached . A coronary ? In a Lincoln B &; B ? If he was on his way out , he preferred to go in his own digs in Islington with Mrs. Wassermann and Carole-anne teary-eyed at his bedside . At last his groping hand found the receiver . " Yes ? " " Bannen . Thought you 'd never answer . You still sleeping ? I 've been up for hours . " Jury gritted his teeth . " Good for you . But what 's taxing your Lincolnshire police at six A.M. ? " " Get your skates on and I 'll take you somewhere interesting . " " Where would that be ? " Jury was rubbing what felt like glass dust from his eyes . " Wyndham Fen . " " Where 's that ? " " I can pick you up in twenty minutes . Be ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on empty air , as Bannen had already hung up . The bedside clock stubbornly refused to advance its hands to a decent hour . It was six-ten on this February morning and dark as the grave . * Jury had n't expected they 'd be driving forty miles southeast toward Spalding . But that 's what they had done . " National Trust Property , " Bannen had told him and not much else . At seven-thirty in the morning , Wyndham Fen was steeped in gray silence , except for the occasional hoot of an owl or saberlike rattle of the tall reeds in its narrow canals . Crystal cobwebs hung between post and rail of the boardwalk ; out in the distant pastures , the rime-caked sheep looked as if they were dressed in glass coats . Morning might have been the time when the fens were most picturesque ; Wyndham Fen would have been , except for the body . She was lying face upward in one of the canals , around her neck a blue bracelet of skin that told the manner of death -- she 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was surrounded by rush grass and water violets , and Jury thought of the Burne-Jones painting of Ophelia . But unlike the beautiful Ophelia , this young woman was anything but pretty . Her face was engorged and blackened with blood ; the eyes and tongue protruded . But he could tell , even before this disfigurement , she probably had n't been pretty . The face would have been pudgy , the body more so . He bet she had n't had many chances in her short life and now she 'd have none at all . She might have bloomed later in life , but there would be no later life for her . Bannen walked back along the narrow boardwalk that spanned the canal to consult with one of his men . A dozen cars and a couple of vans were pulled up near the small building which served as a tourist center , a place to disseminate brochures and pamphlets about the fens . Police who 'd been in the cars were now fanned out over the spiky , frozen grass and the dirt road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed for a February morning in the Lincolnshire fens . Jury could n't take his eyes off the girl floating in the water . Bannen returned with the medical examiner , who set about getting his bag open . Jury thought he was probably not on the payroll of the constabulary , but was a simple country doctor . Bannen rocked back slightly on his heels and said , " Dorcas Reese . " He sighed and puffed out his cheeks . " Did you know her ? " " I knew her slightly . She was housemaid and vegetable cook at Fengate . " Jury stared at him , shocked . Bannen frowned as the medical examiner directed the removal of Dorcas Reese 's body from the water . " You could n't do that in situ , could you ? " When the doctor gave him a look , Bannen added , " No , I expect not . " He sighed . These provincials . Jury was dismayed by Bannen 's apparent sanguinity . " You 're saying that this is the second death connected with that house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? " Bannen was still looking down at the water closing over the place where Dorcas Reese had floated . Bladderwort and water violets swayed on their delicate antennaelike stems . " She should have been looked at where she lay . " Bannen 's tone was disapproving , as if it were really difficult to get good help these days . " Strange , is n't it ? " he said , ambiguously . They were hoisting the body onto the board for the doctor 's examination . Bannen walked round the body , studying it , exchanging a few words with the doctor . Back with Jury , he said , " He thinks it was a length of material , a Illegible perhaps . She was garroted . Beyond dumping her in the canal -- or she could simply have fallen in after death -- no attempt was made to hide her . ' Jury looked behind him at the Visitors ' Center . " Is this open now ; Middle of February ? I expect in the warmer weather there 's quite a lot of tourists . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be , if we were n't shutting it down . " Bannen looked off into the distance . " The fen is about halfway between Fengate and --  " He turned to look behind him . "  - -  the pub where she worked some nights . Just away off there on the main road . Called the Case Has Altered .... Um . " He ran his thumb across his forehead , reflecting " You do n't appear especially surprised . " Jury thought Bannen probably never appeared surprised . He turned to look at Jury out of his cool gray eyes , smiling slightly . " Oh , I 'm surprised . Yes . I 'm surprised she was strangled . Verna Dunn was shot . " " Killed by the same person , you mean ? " Bannen turned his head slowly to regard Jury . " This is Lincolnshire , not London . That we would have two murders in the space of two weeks , both targeting women from one house --  " He shook his head . " Yes , it would be hard to think two killers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger under his collar as if the collar was too tight . " Usually it 's the same method . When one 's compelled to kill , it would be in such a way and by such means as would relieve some sort of anxiety ... You think that 's funny ? " " You sound like a psychiatrist , Chief Inspector . I expect I do n't believe much in solving murders with mind-games . Basically , it 's all plodding --  " Jury caught himself , thinking , My God , I 'm beginning to sound like Chief Superintendent Racer : " It 's one foot in front of the other , police work is , Jury ; it 's plodding , Jury , not your slippery-minded conundrums .... " And here he was with this detective chief inspector , whom he hardly knew , and who had , clearly , solved cases in just the way he said -- or he would n't be saying it . Why was Jury adopting this condescending manner ? Yet Bannen did n't appear to take offense . Perhaps he thought there were more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyndham Fen . " It was all like this once . " Bannen looked at the ground , at the wet grass and the scarves of silver cobwebs stretched across it . With his foot he separated the tall reeds . A field mouse skittered off . " I 'm driving along to the Wash now , to have another look . I expect you might like to see it . " Jury was surprised by the invitation . " Yes . I certainly would like to . " He wondered if Bannen were , indeed , soliciting the help of Scotland Yard . The Wash had been the site of the first murder . " There 's a public footpath that borders this part of the fen , and she probably took that because it goes right past Fengate . " He turned his head to the tree above them , where starlings whicked upward from the branches and knit a black pattern across the whitening sky , then vanished in the seconds it took to mark their flight . Bannen watched them . " Always makes me feel rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued talking about the footpath . " On the other end , it passes the Case Has Altered . The Owens were surprised she had this job moonlighting . Is that what they call it ? Moonlighting ? " He smiled . " Pretty word . " Bannen scratched his neck again , seeming to afford this point as much deep thought as any other that had come up that day . They turned from the drainage ditch and made their way back along the boardwalk to the small car park . Bannen said , " My sergeant is down with some godawful allergy . He 's violently allergic to whatever the stuff is that comes off the alder and hazel trees . " Jury smiled . " Your sergeant would get on with my sergeant like a house afire . " , " Oh ? Is he allergic to the stuff ? " " He 's allergic to all stuff . " * You can see the difficulty , " said Bannen , with his characteristic gesture of rubbing a thumbnail across his brow . As if he 'd spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it . They stood together on the saltings , looking out over that part of the Lincoln-Norfolk coast called the Wash . The public footpaths only went so far , stopping before the seawall . They had walked farther -- up over the seawall and down again . Bannen had said there was no danger here of quicksand , as there was much farther out . Like an interior shoreline , the saltings , composed of mud and silt , stretched to meet sand that formed the protective barrier between land and sea . Bannen had pointed out the narrow , choked end of the River Welland where it ran no wider than a stream , into the waters of the North Sea . There were a number of " danger " areas , legacy of the war . " Mines , " said Bannen . " The Wash is littered with them . " He pulled the collar of his windbreaker tighter . " This is where we thought the invasion would come . " He nodded toward the North Sea . " There were gun platforms out there , big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still there , some of them . " Jury looked at him , speculatively . " ' We ' ? You were n't in that war , surely . You must have been a kid . " Bannen smiled . " I was , but old enough to remember how the beaches were mined , and we were n't to get near them . " They stood in silence for a minute . Then Bannen said , " Difficult . Our M.E. put Verna Dunn 's death down to between ten the night of February first to one A.M. the morning of the second , Sunday . Though she was n't found until afternoon . So the body 'd been lying here in all of this muck . Hellish cold and windy . Brutal . " He made it sound as if Verna Dunn had been alive to suffer through this exposure . " She might not have been found at all if the sands had shifted a certain way . They do , you know . We 're still finding wrecks , hulls of ships . Over on Goodwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombers . Sand covered it up for all of these years . " " You think that was her killer 's intention ? To bury the corpse ? " " I would do , only it 's a bit iffy . He might have been counting on high tide . Spring tide 's twice as high , and if you noticed the seawalls behind us "  - -  Bannen hooked his thumb back toward the walls --  " that 's one of the reasons for them . Neap tide -- low tide -- comes twice a month and the moon was in third quarter that night . It 's the pull of the moon ... " Bannen grew contemplative . Jury held up his hand , palm out . " You 've lost me . " " One simply has to look at the tide chart . I did . The killer might have been planning on high tide , the tides and the sand . But he must have miscalculated . Tide was n't all the way in when the body was found . " He rubbed his thumbnail across his forehead . " That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the moon ? " Depressed as he was , Jury wanted to laugh . " Somehow I ca n't imagine Jenny Kennington counting on the moon . And the thing you seem to be forgetting is that counting on it implies a great deal of calculation , not impulse . " Bannen smiled slightly . " Oh , I 'm not forgetting , no . " " Who found the body ? " " Coastguard . Otherwise , God knows when she 'd have been discovered . I mean this is n't Skegness by a long chalk . As I 've said , this area was heavily mined in the war and a lot of mines went missing . Shells , too . The danger areas are clearly marked . Nobody 'd be strolling along the Wash for the pleasure of it . It was quite deliberately chosen . " Bannen paused . " I narrowed time-of-death down a little more because I think it 's quite a reasonable assumption to say she must have been shot between ten-thirty Saturday night and twelve-thirty early Sunday morning . It was close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her car parked at the end of the driveway , and it would have taken at least fifteen minutes for whoever drove to get back . No one heard the car return . " Bannen sighed . " No one at Fengate called when she did n't come back to the house with Jenny Kennington ? " Jury frowned . " Oh , I expect someone would have done , only , you see , they thought she 'd simply taken it into her mind to drive off , or even drive back to London . Since she was n't with Kennington , they just made that assumption -- that she 'd driven off . She was like that , apparently , Verna Dunn . Very mercurial , very impulsive . And here she lay . " Bannen bent down and scooped up another handful of silt . " You can imagine what it 's like trying to find anything in this stuff . My men were down on hands and knees , must have gone over a good quarter mile . Well , you ca n't cover the whole area , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled for half a mile down there . " Jury followed his gaze across the shining mud , starry with reflections from the weak sunlight . " Yes , I can see that . Wind does n't help , either , does it ? " " Infernal banshee-winds . " He dusted the shale from his hands and shoved them in his coat pockets . " We found a casing pretty much buried , one in the victim . " He looked behind him . " Cartridge from a .22 rifle . " " Nothing else ? " " The shell , the gun , the car --  ? I 'd say that 's quite a lot . " " You mean you matched the bullet to a gun ? " Jury was getting more anxious moment by moment . They did have a lot . " Max Owen 's . He 's the owner of Fengate . Jennifer Kennington was the Owens ' guest , as I 've said . " Jury looked away , out to sea , said nothing . " There are a surprising number of rifles standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four . Owen 's , Parker 's , Emery's -- Peter Emery 's a kind of groundskeeper for a Major Parker . Emery 's blind but that does n't mean someone else could n't have used his rifle . So we got them all . Oh , and Jack Price even had one . He 's an artist , a sculptor or something like that . Why would he need a rifle ? And how they all managed to get licenses for these guns , I 've no idea . You know how difficult it is . Except for Emery , of course , they 're all fair shots , Parker especially . " " You have n't mentioned the women . Somehow , I ca n't see Jenny Kennington getting off a shot . I do n't think she 's ever handled a gun in her life . " " Afraid you think wrong , then . She used to go out with her husband occasionally , and Price along with them .

Bannen pursed his lips , blew out breath in a soundless whistle . Mildly , he said , " You thought you knew her perhaps better than you knew her . " " Apparently .

" Jury had been only dimly aware that Bannen was speaking of the Porsche . " It did narrow things down a bit . Verna Dunn 's Porsche had distinctive treads . The car , with Dunn in it , presumably , and with a passenger -- whom of course they assumed to be Jennifer Kennington , but she says not -- at any rate , the car drove off about ten-twenty or so -- which is when the Owens and Parker heard a car . Price had gone to his digs , his studio , he calls it , and heard nothing . " Jury hunched down in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water was lead gray , and looked just as heavy . The sensation Jury felt in his chest was like descriptions he 'd heard of heart attacks , or the premonition of one . The intractable wind , the sand , shale , and mud served only to remind him of his powerlessness . But he went doggedly on , trying to convince Bannen -- or himself -- that Jenny Kennington was the wrong suspect . " You assume Verna Dunn had a passenger . But you do n't know that . " " If she did n't , then how did the Porsche get back to Fengate ? " The question was rhetorical . Of course , he was right . Jury said , more to fill the alien air with words than anything else , " But now there 's this Reese woman dead . How can you link Jennifer Kennington to that ? Was she here ? " " She went back to Stratford-upon-Avon on the Tuesday -- that would have been the fourth -- after Verna Dunn was murdered . Stratford , of course , is only a two-hour drive from here . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answer . " Seen enough ? " To last the rest of my life , Jury thought , looking across the Wash and to the North Sea . On the horizon , a black ship hung motionless . " You can see the difficulty , " said Bannen , again , running his thumb across his forehead .
