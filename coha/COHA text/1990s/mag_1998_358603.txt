Visitors board Simba One , an oversize tram ( seats 32 ) that will take you on a safari through " the Serengeti grassland system , " and as one fellow steps into the open-air vehicle , he asks , " Is it air-conditioned ? " No , mate , this is reality . Real crocodiles lazing primordially below that rickety bridge . Actual cheetahs motoring their stretch-limo bodies across the savanna . Genuine loamy smell over there near the warthog . ( Hakuna matata , guys  --  it 's only nature 's perfume . ) <P> And real work for the travelers . The recorded voice at the start of the adventure encourages you to " Grow eyes ! " ; there are dozens of shy creatures  --  Waldo-beasts , if you will  --  waiting to be discovered by the visitor who is visually acute . Look hard for the gray elephant trying to tuck herself behind the grayish rock . Flick a peek to one side and catch a pair of two-ton white rhinos who seem to have sleepy-mean eyes to butt the tram ( hatari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African crowned cranes off to the right . The driver turns on a radio , a sweet Swahili tune ( Hapa Dunianai by the Voices of Celebration ) wafts through the air , and the cranes turn into an impromptu chorus line , stepping gracefully to the music . <P> Is it " real , " or is it that artful contradiction , Disney reality ? For this is Disney 's Animal Kingdom , the spectacular , instructive , $800 million new species of theme park that will open next week , surrounded by the usual ballyhoo and , for Disney , the usual naysayers and pickets ( see box ) . " We 're in the magic business , " says chairman and CEO Michael Eisner , " and this park is all about magic and illusion . " <P> The magic of numbers , the illusion of intimacy . More exotic creatures are on display in the 20-min. safari ride than would likely be seen on a week 's trek through Africa : okapis , nyalas , zebras , giraffes , ostriches , Thompson gazelles , hippos and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cross the bumpy road . And thanks to feeding stations hidden in tree bogs , the animals will usually be grazing in view . Thus Animal Kingdom solves the dilemma of the modern zoo : how to keep animals out of cages but still on more or less predictable display . <P> The animals ' behavior is not so much altered as stage-managed . To the visitor , that lion and lioness sunbathing on Pride Rock look close enough ... well , close enough to eat you . But they are separated from the tram by an unseen gulch too wide for the beasts to straddle . The savanna where they roam was once drab cow pasture , but every weed and rut has been meticulously contoured and art-directed to resemble an African plain . Disney 's Imagineers did a convincing makeover . When Franklin Sonn , the South African ambassador to the U.S. , saw the place last month , he said , " This is the bush veldt . This is my home . " <P> At 500 acres , Animal Kingdom , fourth of the Walt Disney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , EPCOT Center ( 1982 ) and Disney-MGM ( 1989 )  --  is the biggest . The company hired 2,800 workers to build the park and 2,500 " cast members " ( performing employees ) to entertain and instruct all the visitors . As many as 10 million are expected the first year .
