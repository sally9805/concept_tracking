 | her . All she needed the spinach for was her mint pea soup . But she did n't bother explaining that and instead selected a can of chicken broth . " Oh , " Adrian said , traveling past her , " consomme ! I meant to buy some . " He dropped a tin in her cart  --  a fancy brand with a sleek white label . Then he wandered on , hands jammed flat in his rear pockets . Come to think of it , he reminded Delia of her first real boyfriend  --  in fact , her only boyfriend , not counting her husband . Will Britt had possessed this same angularity , which had seemed graceful at some moments and ungainly at others ; and he had cocked his elbows behind him in just this way , like knobby , sharp wings , and his ears had stuck out a bit too . It was a relief to find that Adrian 's ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of the aisle they looked in both directions . No telling where Rosemary might pop up next , with that carefree , untrammeled tote basket . But the coast was clear , and Delia nosed her cart toward paper goods . " What , " Adrian said , " you want to buy more ? " Yes , she did . She had barely passed the halfway mark . But she saw his point . The longer they hung around , the greater his chances of another confrontation . " We 'll leave , " she decided . She started for the nearest checkout counter , but Adrian , lacing his fingers through the grid of the cart , drew it toward the express lanes . " One , two , three . . . " She counted her purchases aloud . " We ca n't go there ! I 've got sixteen , seventeen . . . " He pulled the cart into the fifteen-item lane , behind an old woman buying nothing but a sack of dog chow . He started dumping noodle boxes onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bag for her checkbook . The old woman in front of them , meanwhile , was depositing bits of small change in the cashier 's palm . She handed over a penny and then , after a search , another penny . A third penny had a piece of lint stuck to it , and she plucked that away painstakingly . Adrian gave an exasperated sigh . " I forgot cat food , " Delia told him . She had n't a hope in this world that he would volunteer to go back for it ; she just thought a flow of talk might settle him down some . " Seeing that dog chow reminded me , we 're almost out , " she said . " Oh , never mind . I 'll send Ramsay for it later . " The old woman was hunting a fourth penny . She was positive , she said , that she had another one somewhere . " Ramsay ! " Adrian repeated to himself . He sighed again  --  or no , this  | 1 time he was laughing . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delia . " Well , yes , I do . " " I knew it ! Everybody in Roland Park has a last name for a first name . " So ? " she said , stung . " What 's wrong with that ? " " Oh , nothing . " " It is n't even true , " she said . " Why , I know lots of people who ? " " Do n't take offense ! I live in Roland Park myself , " he said . " It 's just pure luck I was n't named . . . oh , Bennington , or McKinney ; McKinney was my mother 's maiden name . I bet your husband 's mother 's . . . and if we decide against the blancmange tonight we can always have it tomorrow night , do n't you think ? " She felt dislocated for a second , until she understood that Rosemary must be in earshot again . Sure enough : a tote basket , still loaded , arrived on the counter behind her own groceries . By now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dog chow , and the cashier was asking them , " Plastic bags , or paper ? " " Plastic , please , " Adrian said . Delia opened her mouth to object ( she generally chose paper , herself ) , but she did n't want to contradict Adrian in front of his wife . Adrian said , " Delia , I do n't believe you 've met my ... " Delia turned around , already plastering a pleasantly surprised smile on her face . " My , ah , Rosemary , " Adrian said , " and her , ah , Skipper . This is Delia Grinstead . " Rosemary was n't smiling at all , which made Delia feel foolish , but Skipper gave her an amiable nod . He kept his arms folded across his chest  --  short , muscular arms , heavily furred , bulging from the sleeves of his polo shirt . " Any relation to Dr. Grinstead ? " he asked her . " Yes ! He 's my . . . he was my . . . he 's my husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husband , in the present situation ? But Skipper seemed to take this in stride . He told Rosemary , " Dr. Grinstead 's my mother 's GP . Been treating her forever . Right ? " he asked Delia . " Right , " she agreed , not having the faintest idea . Rosemary , meanwhile , went on studying her coolly . She carried her head at a deliberate tilt , accentuating the asynlmetrical hairdo with its dramatic downward slant toward her chin . It was none of Delia 's business , of course , but  | privately she thought Adrian deserved somebody more likable . She thought even Skipper deserved somebody more likable . She wished she had worn high heels this morning , and a dressier dress . " Dr. Grinstead is just about the last man in Baltimore who makes house calls , " Skipper was telling Rosemary . " Well , only if it 's absolutely essential , " Delia said . A reflex : she never gave up trying to protect her husband from his patients . Behind her , the scanner said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registering her groceries . The music had stopped playing several minutes back , as Delia just now noticed , and the murmuring of shoppers elsewhere in the store sounded hushed and ominous . ' That 'll be thirty-three forty , " the cashier announced . Delia turned to fill in her check and found Adrian handing over the money . " Oh ! " she said , preparing to argue . But then she grew conscious of Rosemary listening . Adrian flashed her a wide , sweet smile and accepted his change . " Good seeing you , " he told the other couple . He walked on out , pushing the cart , with Delia trailing behind . It had been raining off and on for days , but this morning had dawned clear and the parking lot had a rinsed , fresh , soft look under a film of lemony sunlight . Adrian halted the cart at the curb and lifted out two of the grocery bags , leaving the third for Delia . Next came the problem of whose car to head for . He was already starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dry cleaner 's , when she stopped him . " Wait , " she said . " I 'm right here . " " But what if they see us ? We ca n't leave in two different cars ! " " Well , I do have a life to get back to , " Delia snapped . This whole business had gone far enough , it occurred to her . She was missing her baby-food spinach and her cornflakes and untold other items on account of a total stranger . She flung open the trunk of her Plymouth . " Oh , all right , " Adrian said . " What we 'll do is load these groceries very , very slowly , and by that time they 'll have driven away . They did n't have so much to ring up : two steaks , two potatoes , a head of lettuce , and a box of after-dinner mints . That wo n't take long . " Delia was astonished at his powers of observation . She watched him arrange his bags in her trunk , after which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something . Orzo , it was  --  a most peculiar , tiny-sized pasta that she 'd often noticed on the shelf but never bought . She had thought it resembled rice , in which case why not serve  | rice instead , which was surely more nutritious ? She handed him the bag she was holding , and he settled that with elaborate care between the first two . " Are they coming out yet ? " he asked . " No , " she said , looking past him toward the store . " Listen , I owe you some money . " My treat . " " No , really , I have to pay you back . Only I planned to write a check and I do n't have any cash . Would you accept a check ? I could show you my driver 's license , " she said . He laughed . " I 'm serious , " she told him . " If you do n't mind taking a ? " Then she caught sight of Skipper and Rosemary emerging from the supermarket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a purse the size of a sandwich , on a glittery golden chain . " Is it them ? " Adrian asked . " It 's them . " He bent inside her trunk and started rearranging groceries again . " Tell me when they 're gone , " he said . The couple crossed to a low red sports car . Rosemary was at least Skipper 's height if not taller , and she had the slouching , indifferent gait of a runway model . If she had walked into a wall , her hipbones would have hit first . " Are they looking our way ? " Adrian asked . " I do n't think they see us . " Skipper opened the passenger door , and Rosemary folded herself out of sight . He handed in the sack of groceries and shut the door , strode to the driver 's side , slid in and started the engine . Only then did he shut his own door . With a tightly knit , snarling sound , the little car spun around and buzzed off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trunk lid . He seemed older now . For the first time , Delia saw the fragile lines etched at the corners of his mouth . " Well , " he said sadly . It seemed crass to mention money again , but she had to say , " About the check ... " " Please . I owe you , " he said . " I owe you more than that . Thanks for going along with me on this . " It was nothing , " she told him . " I just wish there 'd been , oh , somebody really appropriate . "  | " Appropriate ? " " Somebody . . . you know , " she said . " As glamorous as your wife . " " What are you talking about ? " he asked . " Why , you 're very pretty ! You have such a little face , like a flower . " She felt herself blushing . He must have thought she was fishing for compliments . " Anyhow , I 'm glad I could help out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her car door . " Bye , now ! " " Goodbye , " he said . " Thanks again . " As if he had been her host , he went on standing there while she maneuvered out of the parking slot . Naturally she made a mess of it , knowing he was watching . She cut her wheel too sharply , and the powersteering belt gave an embarrassing screech . But finally the car was free and she rolled away . Her rearview mirror showed Adrian lifting a palm iii farewell , holding it steady until she turned south at the light . Halfway home , she had a sudden realization : she should have given him the groceries he had picked out . Good heavens  --  all that pasta , those little grains of orzo , and now she remembered his consomme too . Consomme madrilene : she was n't even sure how to pronounce it . She was driving away with property that belonged to someone else , and it was shameful how pleased she felt , and how lucky , and how rich .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted you to carry too many at once . Delia had forgotten that . She remembered halfway across her front yard , when the crooks of her fingers began to ache . She had n't been able to bring the car around to the rear because someone 's station wagon was blocking the driveway . Nailed to the trunk of the largest oak was a rusty metal sign directing patients to park on the street , but people tended to ignore it . She circled the front porch and picked her way through the scribble of spent forsythia bushes at the side . This was a large house but shabby , its brown shingles streaked with mildew and its shutters snaggletoothed where the louvers had fallen out over the years . Delia had never lived anywhere else . Neither had her father , for that matter . Her mother , an import from the Eastern Shore , had died of kidney failure before Delia could remember , leaving her in the care of her father and her two older sisters . Delia had played hopscotch on the parquet squares in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch off the kitchen , and she had married his assistant beneath the sprawling brass chandelier that reminded her to this day of a daddy longlegs . Even after the wedding she had not moved away but simply installed her husband among her sweet-sixteen bedroom furniture , and once her children were  | born it was not uncommon for a patient to wander out of the waiting room calling , " Delia ? Where are you , darlin ' ? Just wanted to see how those precious little babies were getting along . " The cat was perched on the back stoop , meowing at her reproachfully . His short gray fur was flattened here and there by drops of water . " Did n't I tell you ? " Delia scolded as she let him in . " Did n't I warn you the grass would still be wet ? " Her shoes were soaked just from crossing the lawn , the thin soles cold and papery-feeling . She stepped out of them as soon as she entered the kitchen . " Well , hi there ! " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pajamas , buttering a piece of toast . She placed her bags on the counter and said , " Fancy finding you awake so early ! " " It 's not like I had any choice , " he told her glumly . I lc was her youngest child and the one who most resembled her , she had always thought ( with his hair the light-brown color and frazzled texture of binder 's twine , his freckled white face shadowed violet beneath the eyes ) , but last month he had turned fifteen , and all at once she saw more of Sam in him . He had shot up to nearly six feet , and his pointy chin had suddenly squared , and his hands had grown muscular and disconcertingly competent-looking . Even the way he held his butter knife suggested some new authority . His voice was Sam 's too : deep but fine-grained , not subject to the cracks and creaks his brother had gone through . " I hope you bought cornflakes , " he told her . " Why , no , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait till you hear why I did n't , " she said . " The funniest thing , Carroll ! This real adventure . I was standing in the produce section , minding my own business ? " " There 's not one decent thing in this house to eat . " " Well , you do n't usually want breakfast on a Saturday . " He scowled at her . " Try telling Ramsay that , " he said . " Ramsay ? " " He 's the one who woke me . Came stumbling into the room in broad daylight , out all night with his lady friend . No way could I get back to sleep after that . " Delia turned her attention to the grocery bags . ( She knew where this conversation was headed . ) She started rummaging through them as if the cornflakes might emerge after all . " But let me tell you my adventure , "  | 7 she said over her shoulder . " Out of the blue , this man is standing next to me . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will Britt . I do n't believe I ever mentioned Will to you . " " Mom , " Carroll said . " When are you going to let me move across the hall ? " " Oh , Carroll . " " Nobody else I know has to room with their brother . " " Now , now . Plenty of people in this world have to room with whole families , " she told him . " Not with their boozehead college-boy brother , though . Not when there 's another room , perfectly empty , right across the hall . " Delia set down the box of orzo and faced him squarely . She noticed that he needed a haircut , but this was not the moment to point that out . " Carroll , I 'm sorry , " she said , " but I am just not ready . " " Aunt Eliza 's ready ! Why are n't you ? Aunt Liza was Grandpa 's daughter too , and she says of course I should have his room . She does n't understand what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Delia said gaily . " Spoiling such a pretty day with disagreements ! Where 's your father ? Is he seeing a patient ? " Carroll did n't answer . He had dropped his toast to his plate , and now he sat tipping his chair back defiantly , no doubt adding more dents to the linoleum . Delia sighed . " Sweetie , " she said , " I do know how you feel . And pretty soon you can have the room , I promise . But not just yet ! Not right now ! Right now it still smells of his pipe tobacco . " " It wo n't once I 'm living there , " Carroll said . " But that 's what I 'm afraid of . " " Shoot , I 'll take up smoking , then . " She waved his words away with a dutiful laugh . " Anyhow , " she said . Is your father with a patient ? " " Naw . " " Where is he ? " " He 's out running . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chomped down on it noisily . " lie 's doing what ? " " He 's running , Mom. , , " Well , did n't you at least offer to go with him ? " " He 's only running around the Gilman track , for gosh sakes . "  | " I asked you children ; I begged you not to let him go alone . What if something happens and no one 's around to help ? " " Fat chance , on the Gilman track , " Carroll said . " He should n't be running anyway . He ought to be walking . " " Running 's good for him , " Carroll said . " Look . He 's not worried . His doctor 's not worried . So what 's your problem , Mom ? " Delia could have come up with so many responses to that ; all she did was press a hand to her forehead . These were the facts she had neglected to tell that young man in the supermarket : She was a sad , tired , anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in decades . And her husband was even older , by a good fifteen years , and just this past February he had suffered a bout of severe chest pain . Angina , they said in the emergency room . And now she was terrified any time he went anywhere alone , and she hated to let him drive , and she kept finding excuses not to make love for fear it would kill him , and at night while he slept she lay awake , tensing every muscle between each of his long , slow breaths . And not only were her children past infancy ; they were huge . They were great , galumphing , unmannerly , supercilious creatures  --  Susie a Goucher junior consumed by a baffling enthusiasm for various outdoor sports ; Ramsay a Hopkins freshman on the brink of flunking out , thanks to the twenty-eight-year-old single-parent girlfriend he had somehow acquired . ( And both of them , Susie and Ramsay both , were miffed beyond belief that the family finances forced them to live at home . ) And Delia 's baby , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude adolescent , flinching from his mother 's hugs and criticizing her clothes and rolling his eyes disgustedly at every word she uttered . Like now , for instance . Determined to start afresh , she perked all her features upward and asked , " Any calls while I was gone ? " and he said , " Why would I answer the grown-ups ' line , " not bothering to add a question mark . Because the grown-ups buy the celery for your favorite mint pea soup , she could have told him , but years of dealing with teenagers had turned her into a pacifist , and she merely padded out of the kitchen in her stocking feet and crossed the hall to the study , where Sam kept the answering machine . The study was what they called it , and books did line the floor-toceiling shelves , but mainly this was a TV room now . The velvet draperies  | were kept permanently drawn , coloring the air the dusty dark red of an old-time movie house . Soft-drink cans and empty pretzel bags and stacks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the couch , watching Saturday-morning cartoons with her boyfriend , Driscoll Avery . The two of them had been dating so long that they looked like brother and sister , with their smooth beige coloring and stocky , waistless figures and identical baggy sweat suits . Driscoll barely blinked when Delia entered . Susie did n't even do that much ; just flipped a channel on the remote control . " Morning , you two , " Delia said . " Any calls ? " Susie shrugged and flipped another channel . Driscoll yawned out loud . Just for that , Delia did n't excuse herself when she walked in front of them to the answering machine . She bent to press the Message button , but nothing happened . Electronic devices were always double-crossing her . " How do I ? ? " she said , and then an old man 's splintery voice filled the room . " Dr. Grinstead , can you get back to me right away ? It 's Grayson Knowles , and I told the pharmacist about those pills , but he asked i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bugs Runny music . Susie must have raised the volume on the TV . Beep , the machine said , and then Delia 's sister came on . " Dee , it 's Eliza . I need an address . Could you please call me at work ? " " What 's she doing at work on a Saturday ? " Delia asked , but nobody answered . Beep . " This is Myrtle Allingham , " an old woman stated forthrightly . " Oh , God , " Susie told Driscoll . " Marshall and I were wondering if you-all would like to take supper with us Sunday evening . Nothing fancy ! Just us folks ! And do tell young Miss Susie she should bring that darlin ' Driscoll . Say seven o'clock ? " Beep beep beep beep beep . The end . " We went last time , " Susie said , slouching lower on the couch . " Count us out . " " Well , I do n't know , " Driscoll said . " That crab dip she served was not half bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forget it . " " She 's lonesome , is all , " Delia said . " Stuck at home with her hip , no way to get around ? " Something hanged overhead .  | " What 's that ? " she asked . More bangs . Or clanks , really . Clank ! Clank ! at measured intervals , as if on purpose . " Plumber ? " Driscoll said tentatively . " What plumber ? " " Plumber upstairs in the bathroom ? " " I never called for a plumber . " " Dr. Grinstead did , maybe ? " Delia gave Susie a look . Susie met it blandly . " I do n't know what 's come over that man , " Delia said . " He 's been re  --  what 's the word ? ? rejuvenating , resuscitating . . . " Fully aware that neither one of them was listening , she walked on out of the room , still talking . " . . . renovating , I mean : renovating this house to a fare-theewell . If it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd think ... " She climbed the stairs , halfway up encountering the cat , who was hurrying down in a scattered , ungraceful fashion . Vernon detested loud noises . " Hello ? " Delia called . She poked her head into the bathroom off the hall . A ponytailed man in coveralls crouched beside the claw-footed tub , studying its pipes . " Well , hello , " she said . He twisted around to look at her . " Oh . Hey , " he said . " What seems to be the trouble ? " " Ca n't say just yet , " he said . He turned back to the pipes . She waited a moment , in case he wanted to add something , but she could tell he was one of those repairmen who think only the husband worth talking to . In her bedroom , she sat down on Sam 's side of the bed , picked up the telephone , and dialed Eliza 's work number . " Pratt Library , " a woman said . " Eliza Felson , please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow against the headboard , and then she swung her feet up onto the frilled pink spread . The plumber had progressed to the bathroom between her room and her father 's . She could n't see him , but she could hear him banging around . What information could you hope to gain front whacking pipes ? " I 'm sorry , " the woman said , " but we ca n't seem to locate Miss Felson . Ale wit slur she 's working today ? " " She must be ; she told me to call her there , and she is n't here at home  | 1 " I 'm sorry . " " Well , thanks anyway . " She hung up . The plumber was whistling " Clementine . " While Delia was dialing Mrs. Allingham , he ambled into the bedroom , still whistling , and she demurely smoothed her skirt around her knees . He squatted in front of the miniature door that opened onto the pipes in the wall . Thou art lost and gone forever , he whistled ; Delia mentally supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knob , and it came off in his hand . She could have told him it would . She watched with some satisfaction as he muttered a curse beneath his breath and fished a pair of pliers from his belt loop . Seven rings . Eight . She was n't discouraged . Mrs. Allingham walked with a limp , and it took her ages to get to the phone . Nine rings . " Hello ? " " Mrs. Allingham , it 's Delia . " " Delia , dear ! How are you ? " " I 'm fine , how are you ? " " Oh , we 're fine , doing just fine . Enjoying this nice spring weather ! Nearly forgot what sunshine looks like , till today . " " Yes , me too , " Delia said . She was overtaken suddenly by a swell of something like homesickness ; Mrs. Allingham 's chipper , slightly rasping voice was so reminiscent of all the women on this street where she had grown up . " Mrs. Allingham , " she said , " Sam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we ca n't bring the children , I 'm Afraid . " " Oh ! " Mrs. Allingham said . " It 's just that they 're so busy these days . You know how it is . " " Yes , of course , " Mrs. Allingham said faintly . " But another time , maybe ! They always enjoy your company . " " Yes , well , and we enjoy theirs too . " " So we 'll see you at seven tomorrow , " Delia said briskly , for she could hear Sam downstairs and she had a million things to do . " Goodbye till then . " By now the plumber had the little door prized open and was peering into the bowels of the wall , but she knew better than to ask him what he 'd found . In the kitchen , Sam stood propped against a counter , taking off his mud-caked running sloes . I lc was telling Carroll , " ... sort of a toboggan effect when 011 lilt those cedar chips .. . "  | " Sam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delia asked . " You knew I 'd worry ! " " Hello , Dee , " he said . His T-shirt was translucent with sweat , his sharp-boned face glistened , and his glasses were fogged . His hair  --  that shade that could be either blond or gray , it had faded so imperceptibly  --  lay in damp spikes on his forehead . " Look at you , " Delia scolded . " You got overheated . You went running all alone and got overheated to boot when the doctor told you a dozen times ? " " Whose car is that in the driveway ? " " Car ? " " Station wagon parked in the driveway . " " Well , does n't it belong to a patient ? No , I guess not . " " Plumber , " Carroll said from behind a glass of orange juice . " Oh , good , " Sam said . " The plumber 's here . " He set his shoes on the doormat and started out of the kitchen , no doubt happily anticipating one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sam , wait , " Delia said , for she had a pang of guilt nagging at the back of her mind . " Before I forget ? " He turned , already wary . " Mr. Knowles phoned  --  something to do with his pills , " she said . " I thought he got that straightened out . " " And also , um , Mrs. Allingham . She wanted to know if we could come for He groaned . " No , " he said , " we ca n't . " " But you have n't even heard yet ! A light Sunday supper , she said , and I told her ? " " I 'm sure not going , " Carroll broke in . " No , I told her that ; I told her you kids were tied up . But you and I , Sam , just for ? " " We ca n't make it , " Sam said flatly . " But I 've already accepted . " He had been on the point of turning away again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I should have checked with you first , but by accident somehow I just went ahead and accepted . " " Well , then , " he said , " you 'll have to call her back and unaccept . " " . Nut , Sam ! "  | He left . She looked over at Carroll . " How can he be so mean ? " she asked , but Carroll just raised one eyebrow in that urbane new way she suspected him of practicing in the mirror . Sometimes she felt like a tiny gnat , whirring around her family 's edges . The linoleum was slick and chilly beneath her feet , and she would have gone back upstairs for her slippers except that Sam and the plumber were upstairs . Instead , she turned to her grocery bags and unpacked several more boxes of pasta . Maybe she could tell Mrs. Allingham that Sam had been taken ill . That was always risky , though , when you lived in the same block and could so easily be observed , hale and hearty , stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed and shut a cabinet door . " When did this start happening to me ? " she asked Carroll . " Huh ? " " When did sweet and cute turn into silly and inefficient ? " He did n't seem to have an opinion . Her sister appeared in the doorway , rolling up her shirt sleeves . " Morning , all ! " she announced . " Eliza ? " There were days when Eliza seemed almost gnomish , and this was one of them . She wore her gardening clothes  --  a pith helmet that all but obscured her straight black Dutch-boy bob , a khaki shirt and stubby brown trousers , and boys ' brown oxfords with thick , thick soles intended to make her seem taller . ( She was the shortest of the three Felson sisters . ) Her hrn-rimmed glasses overwhelmed her small , blunt , sallow face . " I figured I 'd transplant some of those herbs before the ground dried out , " she told Delia . " But I thought you were at work . " " Work ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought . " Eliza looked over at Carroll . He raised that eyebrow again . " You called and left a message on the machine , " Delia said , " asking inc to find an address . " " That was ten days ago , at least . I needed Jenny Coop 's address , remember ? " ' Then why did I just get it off the answering machine ? " " Mont , " Carroll said . " You must have been playing back old calls . "  | " Well , how is that possible ? " " You did n't have the machine turned on in the first place , see , and then when you pressed the Message button ? " " Oh , Lord , " Delia said . " Mrs. Allingham . " " Is there coffee ? " Eliza asked her . " Not that I know of . Oh , Lord ... " She went over to the wall phone and dialed Mrs. Allingham 's number . " I 'm snug in bed , " Eliza was telling Carroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sleep till noon  --  when who should come crawling through that door in the back of my closet but another one of your father 's blasted repairmen . " " Mrs. Allingham ? " Delia said into the phone . " This is Delia again . Mrs. Allingham , I feel like such a dummy but it seems I got my calls mixed up and it was last week you invited us for . And of course last week we went , and a lovely time we had too ; did I write you a thank-you note ? I meant to write you a thank-you note . But this week we 're not coming ; I mean I realize now that you did n't invite us for ? " " But , Delia , darlin ' , we 'd be happy to have you this week ! We 'd be happy to have you any old time , and I 've already sent Marshall off to the Gourmet To Go with a shopping list . " " Oh , I 'm so sorry , " Delia said , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she shouted , " Anyhow ! We 'll have to invite you to our place , very soon ! Goodbye ! " She replaced the receiver and glared at Eliza . " If only coffee tasted as good as it smells , " Eliza said serenely when the grinder stopped . Sam and the plumber were descending the stairs . Delia could hear the plumber 's elasticized East Baltimore vowels ; he was waxing lyrical about water . " It 's the most amazing substance , " he was saying . " It 'll burst out one place and run twenty-five feet along the underside of a pipe and commence to dripping another place , where you least expect to see it . It 'll lie in wait , it 'll bide its time , it 'll search out some little cranny you would never think to look . " Delia placed her hands on her hips and stood waiting . The instant the two men stepped through the door , she said , " I certainly hope you 're satisfied , Sam Grinstead . " " Hmm ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , good , " Sane said absently .  | " I broke our promise . I ducked out of our commitment . I probably hurt her feelings for all time , " Delia told him . But Sam was n't listening . He was following the plumber 's forefinger as it pointed upward to a line of blistered plaster . And Eliza was measuring coffee , so the only one who paid any heed was Carroll . He sent Delia a look of utter contempt . Delia turned sheepishly to her grocery bags . From the depths of one she drew the celery , pale green and pearly and precisely ribbed . She gazed at it for a long , thoughtful moment . " Are n't you clever to say so ! " she heard Adrian exclaim once again , and she held the words close ; she hugged them to her breast as she turned back to give her son a beatific smile .  | " very pretty ! " and , " You have such a little face , like a flower . " Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which incidentally was little ? Or had its littleness been his sole point ? She preferred the first interpretation , although the second , she supposed , was more likely . Also , he had praised her marvelous blancmange . Of course the blancmange did not really exist , but still she felt a lilt of pride , remembering that he had found it marvelous . She studied her face in the mirror when nobody else was around . Yes , maybe it did resemble a flower . If he had been referring to those flowers that seem freckled . She had always wanted to look more dramatic , more mysterious  --  more adult , in fact . It had struck her as unfair that she should be wrinkling around the eyes without ever losing the primfeatured , artless , triangular face of her childhood . But evidently Adrian had considered that attractive . Unless he had been speaking out of kindness . She checked for his name in the phone book , but he must have had an unlisted number . She kept watch for him on the streets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days she drove hack to the supermarket , on both occasions wearing the dress with the smocked , gathered  | 7 front that made her seem less flat-chested . But Adrian never appeared . And if he had , what would she have done ? It was n't that she 'd fallen in love with him or anything like that . Why , she did n't even know what kind of person he was ! And she certainly did n't want ( as she put it to herself ) " something to start up . " Ever since she was seventeen , she had centered her life on Sam Grinstead . She had not so much as glanced at any other man from the moment she first met him . Even in her daydreams , she was n't the type to be unfaithful . Still , whenever she imagined running into Adrian , she was conscious all at once of the light , quick way she naturally moved , and the outline of her body within the folds of her dress . She could n't remember when she had last been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At home , four workmen were installing air-conditioning  --  another of Sam 's sudden renovations . They were slicing through floors and walls ; they were running huge , roaring machines ; they were lugging in metal ducts and bales of what looked like gray cotton candy . Delia could lie irr bed at night and gaze straight upward through a new rectangle in the ceiling to the stark bones of the attic . She pictured bats and barn swallows swooping down on her while she slept . She fancied she could hear the house groaning in distress  --  such a modest , mild house , so unprepared for change . But Sam was jubilant . Oh , he could hardly fit in his patients between visits from repairmen . Electricians , plasterers , and painters streamed through his office with estimates for the many improvements he planned . A carpenter arrived for the shutters , and a man with a spray for the mildewed shingles . Twenty-two years Sam had lived here ; had he felt so critical of his surroundings all along ? He had first walked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , some three weeks after her high-school graduation . Delia had been sitting in her usual place at the desk , even though it was not her usual time ( she worked afternoons , mostly ) , because she was so eager to meet him . She and her sisters had talked of nothing else since Dr. Felson had announced his hiring . Was this person married ? they had asked , and how old was he ? and what did he look like ? ( No , he was not married , their father said , and he was , oh , thirty-two , thirty-three , and lie looked fine . Fine ? Well , normal ; perfectly all right , their father said impatiently , for to him what counted most was whether the man could case his workload some  --  take over house calls and the morning office hours ) So Delia rose early that summer day and put on her prettiest  | sundress , the one with the sweetheart neckline . Then she seated herself behind the spinet desk , where she ostentatiously set to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , young Dr. Grinstead stepped through the outside door , carrying a starched white coat folded over his forearm . Sunlight flashed off his clear-rimmed , serious glasses and glazed his sifted-looking blond hair , and Delia could still recall the pang of pure desire that had caused her insides to lurch as if she had leaned out over a cauvon . Sam did n't even remember that meeting . He claimed he 'd first seen her when he came to dinner . It was true there had been such a dinner , on the evening of that same day . Eliza had cooked a roast and Linda had baked a cake ( both advertising their housewifely skills ) , while Delia , the baby , still two months short of her eighteenth birthday and supposedly not even in the running , sat across from Sam and her father in the living room and sipped a grown-up glass of sherry . The sherry had tasted like liquefied raisins and flowed directly to that powerful new root of longing that branched deeper minute by minute . But Sam claimed that when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the couch . Like the king 's three daughters in a fairy tale , he said , they 'd been lined up according to age , the oldest farthest left , and like the woodcutter 's honest son , he had chosen the youngest and prettiest , the shy little one on the right who did n't think she stood a chance . Well , let him believe what he wanted . In any case , it had ended like a fairy tale . Except that real life continues past the end , and here they were with air-conditioning men destroying the attic , and the cat hiding under the bed , and Delia reading a paperback romance on the love seat in Sam 's waiting room  --  the house 's only refuge , since the office and the waiting room were air-conditioned already . Her head was propped on one arm of the love seat , and her feet , in fluffy pink slippers , rested on the other . Above her hung her father 's framed Norman Rockwell print of the kindly old doctor setting his stethoscope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the flimsy partition that rose not quite all the way to the ceiling , Sam was explaining Mrs. Harper 's elbow trouble . Her joints were wearing out , he said . There was a stupefied silence ; even the electric saw fell silent . Then , " Oh , no ! " Mrs. Harper gasped . " Oh , my ! Oh , my heavens above ! This comes as such a shock ! " A shock ? Mrs. Harper was ninety-two years old . What did she expect ?  | Delia would have asked . But Sam said , gently , " Yes , well , I suppose ... " and something else , which Delia could n't catch , for the saw just then started up again as if all at once recalling its assignment . She turned a page . The heroine was touring the hero 's vast estate , admiring its magnificent grounds and its tasteful " appointments , " whatever those might be . So many of these books had wealthy heroes , Delia had noticed . It did n't matter about the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the men came complete with castles and a staff of devoted servants . Never again would the women they married need to give a thought to the grinding gears of daily life  --  the leaky basement , the faulty oven , the missing car keys . It sounded wonderful . " Delia , dear heart ! " Mrs. Harper cried , staggering out of the office . She was a stylish , silk-clad skeleton of a woman with clawlike hands , which she stretched toward Delia beseechingly . " Your husband tells me my joints have just ground themselves down to nubbins ! " " Now , now , " Sam protested behind her . " I did n't say that exactly , Mrs. Harper . " Delia sat up guiltily and smoothed her skirt . She grew aware of the bunny ears on her slippers and the temptress on the cover of her book . ' Tin so sorry , Mrs. Harper , " she said . " Should I schedule another ap-pointment ? " " No , he says I have to go to a specialist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Get her Peterson 's phone number , would you , Dee ? " Sam asked . She rose and went over to the desk , scuffing along in her slippers . ( Mrs. Harper herself wore sharp-toed high heels , which she kept planted on the rug in a herringbone pattern to show off her trim ankles . ) Delia flipped through Rolodex cards arranged not by name but by specialty ? allergy , arthritis . . . . Nowadays , this office served most often as a sort of clearinghouse . Her father used to deliver babies and even performed the more elementary surgeries once upon a time , but now it was largely a matter of bee shots in the spring , flu shots in the fall ; and as for childbirth , why , these patients were long past the age . They were hand-me-downs from her father , most of them . ( Or even , Sam joked , from her grandfather , who had opened this office in 1902 , when Roland Park was still country and no one batted an eye at running a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peterson 's number onto a card and passed it to Mrs. Harper , who examined it suspiciously before tucking it into her bag . " I trust this person is not some mere snip of a boy , " she told Sam . " He 's thirty if he 's a day , " Sam assured her . " Thirty ! My grandson is older than that ! Oh , please , ca n't I go on seeing you instead ? " But already knowing his answer , she turned without a pause toward Delia . " This husband of yours is a saint , " she said . " He 's just too good to exist on this earth . I hope you realize that . " " Oh , yes . " " You make sure you appreciate him , hear ? " " Yes , Mrs. Harper . " Delia watched Sam escort the old woman to the door , and then she dropped back onto the love seat and picked up her book . " Beatrice , " the hero was saying , " I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough and desperate  --  uncontrolled , was the way the author put it : uncontrolled , and it sent a thrill down her slender spine within the clinging ivory satin of her negligee . Maybe , instead of running into Adrian , she could just sit still and let him track her down . Maybe he was even now dwelling on his image of her and cruising the streets in search of her . Or he had looked up her address , perhaps ; for he did know her last name . He was parked down the block at this very moment , hoping to catch a glimpse of her . She took to stepping into the yard several times a day . She seized any excuse to arrange herself on the front-porch swing . Never an outdoor person , and most certainly not a gardener , she spent half an hour posed in goatskin gloves among Eliza 's medicinal herbs . And after someone telephoned but merely breathed and said nothing when she answered , she jumped up at every new call like a teenager . " I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't any calls , she made a teenager 's bargains with Fate : I wo n't think about it , and then the phone will ring . I 'll go out of the room ; I 'll pretend I 'm busy and the phone will ring for sure . Shepherding her family into the car for a Sunday visit to Sam 's mother , she moved fluidly , sensuously , like an actress or a dancer conscious every minute of being watched . But if someone really had been watching , think of what he would see : the ragged disarray of Delia 's home life . Ramsay , short and stonefaced and sullen , kicking a tire in disgust ; Carroll and Susie bickering  | over who would get a window seat ; Sam settling himself behind the wheel , pushing his glasses higher on his nose , wearing an unaccustomed knit shirt that made him look weak-armed and fussy . And at the end of their trip , the Iron Mama ( as Delia called her ) ? sturdy , plain Eleanor Grinstead , who patched her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one son single-handed in that spotless Calvert Street row house where she waited now , lips clamped tight , to hear what new piece of tomfoolery her daughter-in-law had contrived . No , not a one of them would bear up beneath the celestial blue gaze of Adrian Bly-Brice . The oldest of the air-conditioning men , the one named Lysander , asked what those hay-bunch things were doing , hanging from the attic rafters . " Those are my sister 's herbs , " Delia said . She hoped to let it rest at that , but her sister happened to be right there in the kitchen with her , stringing beans for supper , and she told him , " Yes , I burn them in little pots around the house . " " You set fire to them ? " Lysander asked . " Each one does something different , " Eliza explained . " One prevents bad dreams and another promotes a focused mind and another clears the atmosphere after interpersonal strife . " Lysander looked over at Delia , raising his gray toothbrush eyebrows . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this job about wrapped up , do you think ? " " This one here ? Oh , no , " he said . He plodded toward the sink ; he had come down to refill his thermos . Waiting for the water to run cold , be said , " We got several more days , at the least . " " Several days ! " Delia squawked . She cleared her throat . " But the noisy part : will that be over soon ? Even the cat is getting a headache . " " Now , how would you know that ? " he asked . " Oh , Delia can read a cat 's mind , " Eliza told him . " She 's got all of us trained in cat etiquette : what kind of voice to use with them and how to do your eyes when you look at them and ? " " Eliza , I need those beans now , " Delia broke in . Too late , though : Lysander snorted as he set his thermos under the faucet . " Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Cats are too sneaky for my taste . " " Oh , well , I like dogs too , of course , " Delia said . ( In fact , she was  | slightly afraid of dogs . ) " It 's just that dogs are so . . . sudden . You know ? " " But honest , " Lysander said . It sounded like an accusation . " Okay if I swipe a few ice cubes ? " " Go right ahead , " Delia told him . He stood there helplessly , clasping the neck of his thermos , until she realized that he meant for her to get them . He would be one of those men who did n't know where their wives kept the spoons . She dried her hands on her apron and went to fetch the bin from the freezer . " Last place we worked ? " he said . " Putting in a new heat pump ? Guy next door owned one of them attack dogs . Dog trained to attack . Lady we was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a staunch grip on his thermos while Delia tried to fit an ice cube in . It would n't go . She hit it with the flat of her hand ( Lysander not even flinching ) and , " Eek ! " she cried , for the ice cube flew up in the air and then skittered across the floor . Lysander stared down at it dolefully . " Just let me at this little devil , " Delia told him , and she snatched the thermos from him and slammed it into the sink . She ran water over a second ice cube . " Aha ! " she crowed , pounding it in . She started working on a third . Lysander said , " So we 're hauling in stuff from the truck one day , come to see the attack dog rounding the side of the house . Big old bristlenecked dog like a wolf , growling real deep in his throat . Lord , I thought I would die . Then out steps the lady we worked for like she had just been waiting for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of his collar , calmnatured as you please . Walks him into the yard next door and , ' Mr. What's-it ? ' she calls . I 'm about to shoot your dog dead unless you come out this minute and retrieve him . ' With her voice just as clear , just as cool . That was some kind of woman , believe me . " Why was he telling this story ? Was it meant to show Delia up ? She dispatched the third ice cube with as little commotion as possible . For some reason , she imagined that the woman had resembled Rosemary Bly-Brice . Maybe she was Rosemary Bly-Brice . She wore an expression of tolerant detachment ; she bent in a graceful S-curve ; she hooked a single finger through the dog 's spiked collar . Unexpectedly , Delia felt a rush of admiration , as if her entrancement with Adrian extended to his wife as well . She turned off the faucet , picked up the thermos , and offered it to Lysander . " Why , looky there , " Lysander said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thermos . " Why , you 've gone and broke it , " he said . Delia did n't apologize . She went on offering the thermos , wishing he would just take it and leave . In the supermarket , she recalled at that instant , she had made some reference to Ramsay , and Adrian had assumed she meant her husband . No wonder he had n't come by yet ! He 'd been looking for Ramsay Grinstead , who was n't in the phone book . Sooner or later , though , he would realize his mistake . She began smiling at the thought , and she continued holding the thermos out until Eliza , clucking , rose to fetch the mop . In the dark the phone rang twice , and Delia woke with a start . She was reviewing her children 's whereabouts even before her eyes were fully open . All three were safe in bed , she decided , but her heart went on racing anyhow . " Hello ? " Sam said . " Yes , this is Dr. Grinstead . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Maxwell was married to the Dowagcr Queen of Hypochondria . " How long has she been experiencing this ? " Sam asked . " I see . Well , that does n't sound serious . Yes , I 'm sure it is uncomfortable , but I doubt very much if ? " A miniature babbling sound issued from the receiver . " Of course she does , " Sam said . " I understand . All right , Mr. axwell  --  if you think it 's that important , I 'll come take a look . " " Oh , Sam ! " Delia hissed , sitting up . Ile ignored her . " See you in a few minutes , then , " he was telling Mr. Maxwell . As soon as he had replaced the receiver , Delia said , " Sam Grinstead , you are such a patsy . You know it 's going to be nothing . Why ca n't he tike her to the emergency room , if she 's so sick ? " " Well , neither one of them drives anymore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor and reached for his trousers , which lay folded Or the back of the rocker . As always , he 'd worn tomorrow 's underwear to bed and placed tomorrow 's clothes conveniently at hand . Delia pressed a palm to her heart , which was only now settling down . Was this anything like what Sam had felt with his chest pains ? She kept trying to imagine . Think of him operating a car at such a time  --  humming long toward a meeting and then noticing his symptoms and smoothly ,  | composedly ( she pictured ) turning his wheel toward Sinai Hospital . Arranging his own admission and asking a nurse to phone Delia and break the news by degrees . ( " Your husband wants you to know he 'll be a tad bit later getting home than planned . " ) And Delia , meanwhile , had been reading Lucinda 's Lover by the fire , without a qualm . She switched on her lamp and climbed out of bed . Two-fifteen , the alarm clock said . Squinting against the light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at her . " Where are you off to ? " he asked . The glasses made his face seem crisper , less vague around the eyes , as if they had corrected Delia 's vision rather than his . She drew her ruffled housecoat over her nightgown and zipped the front before she answered . " I 'm coming with you , " she said . " Pardon ? " " I 'll take you in my car . " " Why on earth would you do that ? " " I just want to , that 's why , " she said . She tied her sash very tight , in hopes her housecoat would pass for streetwear . As she stepped into her flats , she could feel him staring at her , but all she said was , " Ready ? " She collected her keys from the bureau . " Delia , are you doubting my ability to drive my own car anymore ? " Sam asked . " Oh , no ! What a thought ! " she told him . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's such a nice spring night . " He did n't look convinced , but he offered no more arguments when she led the way downstairs . It was not a nice spring night at all . It was cool and breezy , and she wished for a sweater as soon as they stepped out the back door . Towering , luminous clouds scudded across an inky sky . But she headed toward her car at a leisurely pace , resisting the urge to hunch her shoulders against the chill . The streetlights were so bright that she could see her shadow , elongated like a stick figure in a child 's drawing . " This makes me think of Daddy , " she said . She had to speak up , since Sam had walked over to his Buick to retrieve his black bag . She hoped he did n't hear the shiver in her voice . " All the house calls I used to make with Daddy , just the two of us ! Seems like old times . " She slid behind her steering wheel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the car felt refrigerated . It even smelled refrigerated  --  dank and stale . " Of course , Daddy never let me drive liini , " she said when Sans had  | got in . Then she worried this would give him second thoughts , and so she added , laughing slightly , " You know how prejudiced he was ! Women drivers , he always said . . . " She started the engine and turned on her lights , illuminating the double doors of the garage and the tattered net of the basketball hoop overhead . " But whenever I was still up , he 'd say I could come with him . Oh , I tagged along many a night ! Eliza just never was interested , and Linda was so , you know , at odds with him all the time , but I was ready at a moment 's notice . I just loved to go . " Sam had heard all this before , of course . He merely settled his bag between his feet while she backed the car out of the driveway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " In fact I ought to ome with you more often , now the kids are growing up . Do n't you link ? " She was aware that she was chattering , but she said , " It might kind of fun ! And it 's not as if you go out every night , or even every week anymore . " " Delia , I give you my word I am still capable of making the odd Ouse call without a baby-sitter , " Sam told her . " Baby-sitter ! " " I 'm strong as an ox . Stop fretting . " " I 'm not fretting ! I just thought it would be romantic , something the o of us could do together ! " she said . This was n't the whole truth , but as soon as she said it she started to lieve it , and so she felt a bit hurt . Sam merely sat back and gazed out e side window . There was almost no traffic at this hour , and the avenue seemed very t and empty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The newly leafed trees , lit from below , had a tumbled , side-down look . Here and there a second-floor window glowed cozily , and Delia sent it a wistful glance as they passed . In front of the Maxwells ' house , she parked . She turned off the headlights but left the engine and the heater on . " Are n't you coming ? " Sam asked . " I 'll wait in the car . " " You 'll freeze ! " " I 'm not dressed for company . " " Conic in , Dee . The Maxwells do n't care how you 're dressed . " Ile was right , she supposed . ( And the heater had n't even started Wing yet . ) She took the keys from the ignition and slid out of the car follow him up the front walk , toward the broad , columned house  | where those two lone Maxwells must rattle around like dice in a cup . All the windows were blazing , and the inner door stood open . Mr. Maxwell waited just inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen as they crossed the porch . " Dr. Grinstead ! " he said . " Thank you so much for coming . And Delia too . Hello , dear . " He wore food-stained trousers belted just beneath his armpits , and a frayed gray cardigan over a T-shirt . ( He used to be such a natty dresser . ) Without a pause , he turned to lead Sam toward the carpeted stairs . " It breaks my heart to see her this way , " he said as they started the climb . " I 'd suffer in her stead , if I could . " Delia watched after them from the foyer , and when they were out of sight she sat down on one of the two antique chairs that flanked a highboy . She sat cautiously ; for all she knew , the chairs were purely for show . Overhead the voices murmured  --  Mrs. Maxwell 's thin and complaining , Sam 's a rumble . The grandfather clock facing Delia ticked so slowly that it seemed each tick might be its last . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her purse at home ) , she fanned her keys across her lap and sorted through them . How many hours had she sat like this in her childhood ? Perched on a chair or a bottom step , scratching at the insect bites on her bare knees or leafing through a magazine some grown-up had thrust upon her before leading her father up the stairs . And overhead that same murmur , the words never quite distinguishable . When her father spoke , all others fell silent , and she had felt proud and flattered to hear how people revered him . The stairs creaked , and she looked up . It was Mr. Maxwell , descending by himself . " Dr. Grinstead 's just examining her , " he said . He inched down , clinging to the banister , and when he reached the foyer he settled with a wheeze onto the other antique chair . Because the highboy stood between them , all she saw of him was his outstretched trouser legs and his leather slippers , backless , exposing maroon silk socks with transparent heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of indigestion , but I told him , I said , at our age . . . well , you ca n't be too careful , I told him . " " I 'm sure she 'll be all right , " Delia said . " I just thank heaven for Dr. Grinstead . A lot of those younger fellows would n't come out like this . " " None of them would , " Delia could n't resist saying . " Oh , some , maybe . "  | " None . Believe me . " Mr. Maxwell sat forward to look at her . She found his veiny , florid face peering around the highboy . " That Sam is just too nice for his own good , " she told him . " Did you know he has angina ? Angina , at age fifty-five ! What could that mean for his future ? If it were up to me , he 'd be home in bed this very minute . " " Well , luckily it 's not up to you , " Mr. Maxwell said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pause , during which she heard Mrs. Maxwell say something opinionated that sounded like " Nee-nee . Nee-nee . " " We were Dr. Grinstead 's first house call  --  did he ever mention that ? " Mr. Maxwell asked . " Yessir : very first house call . Your dad said , Think you 'll like this boy . ' I admit we were a mite apprehensive , having relied n your dad all those years . " Sam was speaking more briskly now . He must be finishing up . " I asked Dr. Grinstead when he came to us , " Mr. Maxwell said Dreamily . " I said , Well , young man ? ' He 'd only been on the job a couple ays by then . I said , Well ? ' Said , Which one of those Felson girls do you plan to set about marrying ? ' Pretty smart of me , eh ? " Delia laughed politely and rearranged her keys . " Oh , ' he said ; said , I guess I 've got my eye on the youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle one 's too plump , but the youngest , ' she said , is just right . ' So . See there ? I knew before you did . " " Yes , I guess you did , " Delia said , and then Sam started down the irs , the instruments in his black bag cheerily jingling . Mr. Maxwell rose at once , but Delia stayed seated and kept her gaze fixed on her keys . icy seemed uncannily distinct  --  dull-finished , ill-assorted , incised with rand names as clipped and choppy as words from another language . " Just what I . . . , " Sam was saying , and , " Nothing but a touch of . . . , " and , " Left some medication on the . . . " Then he and Mr. axwell were shaking hands , and he said , " Dee ? " and she stood up without a word and stepped through the door that Mr. Maxwell held wit . Outside , the grass had grown white with dew and the air itself seemed white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed into the car and started le engine before Sam was completely settled . " You have to feel for those folks , " he said , shutting his door . " Aging all alone like that , they must well on every symptom . " Delia swung out into the street and drove slightly above the speed  | limit , concentrating , not speaking . They were nearly home before she said , " Mr. Maxwell told me they were your very first house call . " " Really ? " " The second day you worked here . " " I 'd forgotten . " " He said he asked which of the Felson girls you planned to marry and you said the youngest . " " Hmm , " Sam said , unzipping his bag . He checked something inside and told her , " Delia , remind me tomorrow morning to pick up more " The oldest is too short and the middle one 's too plump , ' you said , hut the youngest one is just right . ' " Sam laughed . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , sweetie , how would I remember after all these years ? " She pulled into their driveway and turned the engine off . Sam opened his door , but then , noticing she had not moved , he looked over at her . The little ceiling bulb cast sharp hollows in his face . " You did say it , " she told him . " I recognize the fairy-tale sound of it . " So ? Maybe I did , " he said . " Gosh , Dee , I was n't weighing every word . I might have said too short ' and too plump , ' but what I probably meant was too unconventional ' and too Francophile . ' " " That 's not it , " Delia said . " Why , Linda spent half the evening speaking French , remember ? And when your dad made her switch to English , she still had an accent . " " You do n't even know what I 'm objecting to , do you ? " Delia asked . " Well , no , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of the car and walked toward the back steps . Sam went to replace his bag in the Buick ; she heard the clunk of his trunk lid . " And Eliza ! " he said as he followed her to the house . " She kept asking my opinion of homeopathic medicine . " " You arrived here that very first day planning to marry one of the Felson girls , " Delia told him . She had unlocked the door now , but instead of entering she turned to face him . He was looking down at her , with his forehead creased . " Why , I suppose it must naturally have crossed my mind , " he said . " I 'd completed all my training by then . I 'd reached the marrying age , so to speak . The marrying stage of life . "  | " But then why not a nurse , or a fellow student , or some girl your mother knew ? " " My mother ? " he said . He blinked . " You had your eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him . " You thought , I ' 11 just marry one of Dr. Felson 's daughters and inherit all his patients and his nice old comfortable house . ' " " Well , sweetheart , I probably did think that . Probably I did . But I never would have married someone I did n't love . Is that what you believe ? You believe I did n't marry for love ? " " I do n't know what to believe , " she told him . Then she spun around and walked back down the steps . " Dee ? " Sam called . She passed her car without slowing . Most women would have driven way , but she preferred to walk . The soles of her flats gritted against the sphalt driveway in a purposeful rhythm , reminding her of some tune e could almost name but not quite . Part of her was listening for Sam she had a sense of perking one ear backward , like a cat ) , but another in was glad to be rid of him and pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wo n't even deign to come after me . She ached the street , turned right , and kept going . Her frail-edged shadow eceded her and then drew back and then fell behind as she traveled ow streetlight to streetlight . No longer did she feel the cold . She seemed armed from inside by her anger . Now she understood why Sam had forgotten his actual first glimpse her . He had prepared to meet the Felson girls as a boxed set , that was why .. It had not figured in his plans to encounter an isolated sample head of time . What had figured was the social occasion that evening , with marriageable maidens one , two , and three on display on the livingnn couch . She could envision that scene herself now . All it took was proper perspective to bring it back entire : the itchy red plush cushions , clothlike texture of her frosted sherry glass , and the fidgeting , encroaching , irritating plumpness of the middle sister , next to her . On a branch overhead , the neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doy ! Doy ! Doy ! " he sang in his most lyrical cc , until he was silenced by a billow of rock music approaching from south . Teenagers , evidently  --  a whole carload . Delia heard their hoots lid cheers growing steadily louder . It occurred to her that even Roland was not absolutely safe at this hour . Also , her housecoat would n't fool a soul . She was running around in her nightclothes , basically . She  | took a sudden right turn onto a smaller , darker street and walked close to a boxwood hedge , whose shadow swallowed hers . Sam would be back in bed now , his trousers draped over the rocking chair . And the children did n't know she was missing . With their jumbled , separate schedules , they might not know for days . What kind of a life was she leading , if every single one of last week 's telephone messages could as easily be this week 's ? She walked faster , hearing the carload of music fade away behind her . She reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one split second later , whomp ! she collided with someone . She ran smack against a stretch of tallness and boniness , overlaid by warm flannel . " Oh ! " she said , and she recoiled violently , heart pounding , while somehow a dog became involved as well , one of those shaggy hunting-type dogs shouting around her knees . " Butch ! Down ! " the man commanded . " Are you all right ? " he asked Delia . Delia said , " Adrian ? " In the half-dark he had no color , but still she recognized his narrow , distinctly cheekboned face . She saw that his mouth was wider and fuller , more sculptured , than she had been imagining , and she wondered how she could have forgotten something so important . " Adrian , it 's me . Delia , " she said . The dog was still barking . She said , " Delia Grinstead ? From the supermarket ? " " Why , Delia , " Adrian said . " My rescuer ! " He laughed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " She said , " Oh , just . . . , " and then she laughed too , glancing down at her housecoat and smoothing it with her palms . " Just could n't sleep , " she said . She was relieved to find that he was not so well dressed himself . Ile wore a dark-hued robe of some kind and pale pajamas . On his feet were jogging shoes , laces trailing , no socks . " Do you live nearby ? " she asked him . " Right here , " he said , and he waved toward a matted screen of barberry bushes . Behind it Delia glimpsed a porch light and a section of white clapboard . " I got up to let Butch here take a pee , " he said . " It 's his new hobby : waking me in the dead of night and claiming he needs to go out . " At the sound of his name , Butch sat down on his haunches and grinned up at her . Delia leaned over to give his muzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers . " I ran off with your groceries that day , " she said , ostensibly to the dog . " I felt terrible about it . " " Groceries ? " Adrian asked . " Your orzo and your rotini . . . " She straightened and met his eyes . " I considered hunting up your address and bringing them over . " " Oh . Well . . . orzo ? Well , never mind , " he told her . " I 'm just grateful you helped me out like that . You must have thought I was kind of weird , right ? " " No , not at all ! I enjoyed it , " she said . " You know how sometimes you just want to , say , keep up appearances n front of someone . " " Certainly , " she said . " I ought to start a business : Appearances , incorporated . " " Rent-a-Date , " Adrian suggested . " Impostors To Go . " " With blondes to pose as second wives , and football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And beautiful women in black to weep at funerals , " Adrian said . " Oh , why do n't they have such things ? " Delia asked . " There 's just nothing like that . . . what ? Like that fury , that prideful sort of fury you feel when you 've been hurt or insulted or taken for granted ? " Well . She stopped herself . Adrian was watching her with such peculiar intentness , she worried all at once that she had curlers in her hair . He nearly raised a hand to check , till she remembered she had n't worn tirlers since high school . " Goodness . I should get home , " she said . " Wait ! " Adrian said . " Would you like ... could I offer you some cc ? " " Coffee ? " " Or tea ? Or cocoa ? Or a drink ? " " Well , " she said , " I guess cocoa , maybe . Cocoa might be nice . I can caffeine at this hour would probably . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No trouble at all , " he told her . " Come on inside . " He led her to a gap in the barberry bushes . A flagstone path curved and the house , which was one of those lace-trimmed Victorian cottages young couples nowadays found so charming . The front door was paned with lozenges of glass in sugared-almond colors impossible to see through . Delia felt a sudden pinch of uneasiness . Why , she did n't know a thing about this ' nail ! And no one else on earth had any inkling where she was .  | " Usually if I 'm up at this hour I 'm up for good , " Adrian was saying , " so I fix myself a pot of ? " " What a lovely porch ! " Delia exclaimed . " Maybe we could have our cocoa out here . " " Here ? " He paused on the topmost step and looked around him . It was a depressing porch , really . The floorboards were battleship gray , and the furniture was painted a harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd be cold ? " he asked . " Not a bit , " she told him , although now that she had stopped walking , it did seem cold . She stuffed both fists in the pockets of her housecoat . He gazed down at her a moment . Then he said , " Ah . I see , " and the corners of his mouth quirked upward with amusement . " But if you 're cold . . . , " she said , flushing . " I understand , " he said . " You ca n't be too careful . " " Oh , it 's not that ! Heavens ! " " I do n't blame you in the least . We 'll have our cocoa out here . " " Really , " she said , " why do n't I come in ? " " No , you wait here . I 'll bring it out . " " Please , " she said . " Please let me come in . " And because she saw that the argument would otherwise go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laid it on his wrist . " I want to , " she said . She wanted to come in , she meant . That was what she honestly meant , but the moment the words were out of her mouth she saw that they implied something more , and she dropped her hand and stepped back . " Or maybe . . . , " she said . " Yes , the . . . porch , why do n't we have our cocoa on the . . . " And she felt behind her for a chair and sat down . The icy , uncushioned seat took her breath away for an instant , as if she had heard a piece of startling news , or glimpsed some possibility that had never crossed her mind before .  | " I told Eliza when she picked us up at the airport , " Linda said . " I told h er , Well , one good thing : now that Dad 's gone I wo n't have to share room with you , Eliza . ' Considering how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " And the twins wo n't have to bunk with Susie , ' I said . I figured I Could fit both of them in Dad 's big bed with me . Then I get to the house , and guess what . " " I did plan at first for you to stay there , " Delia said , " but it seemed t ... when I walked in to put the sheets on , it seemed so ... " " Fine , I 'll put the sheets on myself , " Linda said . " I 'll tell you this much : I am surely not sleeping with Eliza when there 's a whole extra moat going empty . " They were standing in the doorway of their father 's room at that moment , gazing in on its heartbreaking neatness , the dim air laden with list motes , the candlewick bedspread unnaturally straight on the mattress . Linda , still in her traveling clothes , had not yet lost that aura of focus ml efficiency that travel gives some people . She surveyed the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see . " You 've certainly wasted no time making changes elsewhere , " she said . " Air-conditioning  | vents every place you look , nursery men tearing out the shrubs , I do n't know what all . " " Oh , well , that 's ? " " I suppose it 's what Sam Grinstead has been waiting for , " Linda said . " He 's finally got the house in his clutches . " Delia did n't argue . Linda sent her a quizzical glance before crossing to their father 's bureau . Leaning into the mirror above it , she raked her fingers through her short brown pageboy . Then she removed her pocketbook , which she wore bandolier style , with the strap slanted over her chest  --  just one more of her European ways . You would never take her for American . ( You would never guess she lived in Michigan , divorced from the French-literature professor who had not , after all , swooped her off to his native Paris as she 'd hoped . ) Her full , soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom of sticky scarlet on her lips , and although her clothes were unexceptional , she wore them with authority  --  those dowdy brown medium-heeled pumps , for instance , defiantly teamed with a navy suit . " But why are we standing around ? No telling what Marie-Claire and Therese have got into , " she said , and the is in her children 's names were very nearly gargled . When she whisked past Delia toward the stairs , she smelled of airplane . In the kitchen , they found Eliza making lemonade for the twins . This fall the twins would be nine years old  --  a long-limbed , sproutlike stage  --  and although they had their mother 's blocky brown haircut , they resembled the professor in every other way . Their eyes were almost black , mournfully downturned ; their mouths were the color of plums . They were assisting each other up a bank of glass-fronted cabinets , the first pulling the second after her once she 'd reached the counter , and for mobility 's sake they had tucked their old-fashioned , European-schoolgirl dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leggier . " As soon as your cousin Susie shows up , she 'll take you to the pool , " Eliza was saying . She stood at the drainboard , reaming lemons . " She promised she 'd do it first thing , but I guess she must be off someplace with her boyfriend . " The mention of a boyfriend diverted them for a second . " Driscoll ? " Marie-Claire asked , pausing in her climb . " Does Susie still date Driscoll ? " " She does indeed . " " Do they go to dances together ? Do they kiss good night ? " Now , that I would n't know , " Eliza said tartly , and she bent to take ; t pitcher froth a cupboard .  | The twins had reached their goal : a jar of peppermints on the top shelf . Inch by inch , Therese maneuvered it through the partially opened door . ( Therese was the uneven-featured twin , her face less balanced , less symmetrical , which made her appear slightly anxious . There was one in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jar seemed suspended , but then it arrived safely in Marie-Claire 's outstretched hands . " Do Ramsay and Carroll have sweethearts too ? " she asked . " Well , Ramsay does , I 'm sorry to say . " " How come you 're sorry ? " Therese asked , and Marie-Claire said , " What 's wrong with her ? " ? the two of them so alert for scandal that Delia laughed aloud . Therese wheeled and said , " Are you sorry too , Aunt Delia ? Do you forbid her to darken your door ? Is she coming to the beach with us ? " " No , she 's not , " Delia said , answering only the easiest question . " The . ach is just a family trip . " They were leaving for a week at the beach early the following morning , Sunday . It had come to be an annual event . In mid-June , as soon as c schools closed , Linda arrived from Michigan and they all took off r a cottage they rented on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber rafts and badminton rackets ; the freezer was fled with casseroles ; and Sam 's patients were thronging in for last-minute consultations in hopes of avoiding any contact with his backup . " Delia , could you get the sugar ? " Eliza asked . She was running water to the pitcher . " And girls , I 'd like five tumblers from that cabinet to nir right . " While Delia was measuring sugar , she secretly checked the clock on c wall above her . Ten minutes till four . She glanced at the twins and ared her throat . " If Susie is n't back by the time you finish your lemonade , maybe I could take you to the pool , " she said . Linda said , " You ? " and the twins said , in a single voice , " You hate swim ! " " Oh , well , I would n't actually go in . I 'd just drive you over , and then tsic could pick you up later . " Eliza clinked ice into the tumblers . Linda took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twins claimed the chairs on either side of her . When Iia placed the pitcher of lemonade in front of them , Marie-Claire cried , " Ick ! It 's full of sill-eddy things ! " " ' Those are good for you , " Linda said as she started pouring . " And big seeds besides ! "  | " They wo n't hurt you . " " That 's what she says , " Therese told Marie-Claire in an ominous tone . " Really they 'll take root in your stomach and grow lemon trees out your ears . " Oh , honestly , Therese , " Linda said . Ignoring her , the twins gazed significantly across the table at each other . Finally Marie-Claire said , " I guess we 're not thirsty after all . " " We 'll just go change into our swimsuits , " Therese added . They scooted their chairs back and raced out of the kitchen . " Ah , me , " Linda sighed . " Sorry , Lize . " " That 's all right , " Eliza said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant , that Eliza was what they used to call an old maid . She looked so forlorn in her eccentric weekend outfit of safari suit and clunky shoes ; she pulled out a chair with her head down , her chopped black hair falling forward to hide her expression , and she seated herself and folded her small hands resolutely on the table . " Well , I 'm thirsty ! " Delia said loudly , and she sat down too and reached for one of the tumblers . From the hall she heard a series of thumps  --  the twins ' suitcase , no doubt , being hauled up the stairs . Apparently they still planned to room with Susie , if the creaks that began overhead were any indication . Outside the open window , a workman 's bearded face popped into view . He looked at the women , blinked , and disappeared . Delia and Linda saw him , but Eliza , who had her back to him , did not . " What is he up to , anyhow ? " Linda asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The workman , " Delia explained . " No , not the workman , " Linda said . " I meant Sam . Why is he having all the shrubs torn out ? " " Well , they 're old and straggly , he says . " " Ca n't he just cut them back or something ? And central air-conditioning ! This house is not the type for air-conditioning . " " I 'm sure we 'll appreciate it once the weather heats up , " Eliza said . " Have some lemonade , Linda . " Linda took a tumbler , but she did n't drink from it . " I 'd just like to know where he found the money , " she said darkly . " Plus : this house is in our three names , not his . We 're the ones Dad left it to . " Delia glanced toward the window . ( She suspected the workman e  | lurking beneath it , absorbed as all workmen seemed to be in other people 's private lives . ) " Goodness ! " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anybody want anything from Eddie 's ? " " Eddie 's ? " Eliza asked . " I might stop for some fruit on my way home . " " Delia , have you forgotten Sam 's mother is coming to dinner ? And you still have the Medicare bills to see to ! Why do n't I take the twins , instead , and then go to Eddie 's after . " " No ! Please ! " Delia said . " I mean , I have plenty of time . And besides , i need to choose the fruit myself because I 'm not sure what I ? " She was offering too many explanations  --  always a mistake . Linda id n't notice , but Eliza could read her mind , Delia sometimes thought , and she was watching Delia consideringly . " Anyhow , " Delia said . " I 'll c you both in a while . Okay ? " And she stood up . Already she heard c twins racketing down the stairs . " Hand me my purse , will you ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for Delia 's purse on ( . counter and passed it over . In the hall , the twins were quarreling over a pair of goggles they must have liberated from the beach equipment . They wore identical skinny it swimsuits in different colors  --  one red , one blue  --  and a red-and -- blue flip-flop apiece on their long , pale , knobby feet . Neither one had towel , but the towels were upstairs and so Delia did n't remind them . Al 's go , " she told them . " I 'm parked out front . " From the kitchen , Linda called , " You do what the lifeguard tells you , girls , hear ? " Delia followed them across the porch , avoiding the shaft of a beach umbrella . Beside the steps , a young man in a red bandanna was hacking the roots of an azalea bush . He straightened , wiped his face on his forearm , and gave them a grin . " Wisht I was going swimming , " he said . " Come with us , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c , you can see he 's not wearing his bathing suit . " They skipped ahead of Delia down the walk , chanting a routine that she remembered i her childhood : " Well , that 's life . " " What 's life ? " " Fifteen cents a copy . " " But I only have a ( lime . " " Well , that 's life . " " What 's life ? " - Fifteen cents a . . "  | The weather was perfect , sunny and not too warm , but Delia 's car had been sitting at the curb collecting heat all day . Both girls squealed as they slid across the back seat . " Could you turn on the air-conditioning ? " they asked Delia . " I do n't have air-conditioning . " " Do n't have air-conditioning ! " " Just open your windows , " she told them , rolling down her own . She started the engine and pulled into the street . The steering wheel was almost too hot to touch . You could tell it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And people were at work in their yards , running their mowers or their hedge trimmers , filling the air with a visible green dust that made Therese ( the allergic one ) sneeze . At Wyndhurst the traffic light changed to amber , but Delia did n't stop . She had a sense of time slipping away from her . She took the long downhill slope at a good ten miles above the speed limit , and screeched left on Lawndale and parked in the first available space . The twins were in a hurry themselves ; they tore ahead of her to the gate , and even before she paid for them they had disappeared among the other swimmers . Driving back up the hill , she kept plucking at the front of her blouse and blowing toward the damp frizz sticking to her forehead . If only she could stop by home and freshen up a bit ! But she would never manage to escape her sisters a second time . She turned south , not so much as glancing northward to Eddie 's . She traveled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reached Bouton Road she parked beneath a maple . Before she got out , she blotted her face on a tissue from her purse . Then she walked through Adrian 's front yard and climbed the porch steps and rang the doorbell . By now the dog knew her well enough so he merely roused himself from the mat to nose her skirt . " Hi , Butch , " she said . She dabbed at his muzzle ineptly , at the same time backing off a bit . The front door opened , and Adrian said , " Finally ! " " I 'm sorry , " she told him , stepping inside . " I could n't get away till Linda came , and would n't you know her plane was late , and them of course I had to make sure that she and the children were ... " She was talking too much , but she could n't seem to stop herself . These first few minutes were always so awkward . Adrian took her pulse from her and set it on a chair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She supposed she must taste of salt . They had not been kissing  | for very long  --  at least not like this , so seriously . They had started with the breeziest peck on the cheek , pretending to be just friends ; then day by clay more parts of them became involved  --  their lips , their open mouths , their arms around each other , their bodies pressing closer until Delia ( it was always Delia ) drew back with a little laugh and a " Well ! " and some adjustment of her clothes . " Well ! Did you get much work done ? " she asked now . He was looking down at her , smiling . He wore kakis and a faded blue chambray shirt that matched his eyes . Over these st few weeks of sunshine his hair had turned almost golden , so that it seemed to give off a light of its own as he stood in the dark hallway e more detail to make her spin away abruptly and walk on into the use as if she had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as only marginally inhabited , which s odd because until three months ago his wife had lived here too . iy , then , did the rooms have this feeling of long-term indifference and neglect ? The living room , viewed from the hall , never enticed her side . Its walls were bare except for a single bland still life above the ; Intel , and instead of a couch , three chairs stood at offended-looking glcs to each other . The tabletops bore only what was useful  --  a lamp , telephone ; none of the decorative this-and-thats that would have taken chill off . " I finished printing out the Adwater piece , " Adrian was saying . " I ught you might look it over and tell me what you think . " He was leading her up the narrow stairway and across the hall , into area that must once have been called the conservatory or the sunroom. it was his office . Cloudy windows lined three walls , their sills piled with papers . Along the fourth wall ran a built-in desk that held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced newsletter . Subscribers from thirty-four states paid actual money for rry Up , Please , a quarterly devoted to the subject of time travel . Its r was a glossy sky blue , its logo an arched wooden mantel clock on keel wheels . Each issue contained an assortment of science fiction and fiction , as well as reviews of time-machine novels and time-machine vies , and even an occasional cartoon or joke . In fact , was this whole publication a joke , or was it for real ? Reading the letters to the editor , ha often wondered . Many of the subscribers seemed to believe in ' nest . At least a few claimed to speak from personal experience . And e detected an almost anthropological tone to the article Adrian handed o ) w -- an essay by one Charles I .. Adwater , Ph.D. , proposing that  | the quality known as " charisma " was merely the superior grace and dash found in visitors from the future who are sojourning in the present . Consider , Dr. Adwater wrote , how easily you and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , by and large , and one in which a denizen of our own decade could hope to make a considerable impact with relatively little effort . " Would you say the 19405 seems , or the 1940S seem ? " Adrian asked . " Either one has arguments for and against it . " Delia did n't answer . She paced the room as she read , chewing her lower lip , squinting at draft-quality print as dotty and sparse as the scabs on an old brier scratch . " Well . . . , " she said , and pretending absentmindedness , she wandered out to the hall while she flipped to the second page . Adrian followed . " In my opinion , Adwater 's style is kind of stuffy , " he was saying , " but I ca n't suggest too many changes because he 's one of the biggest names in the field . " How would you make a name for yourself in the time-travel field ? Delia was intrigued , but only briefly . Her visit to Adrian 's office was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was being upstairs that mattered : roaming the second floor , the bedroom floor , and peeking through each doorway . Adrian slept in a drab little dressing room ; he had moved there after Rosemary left him , so Delia felt free to stroll into the master bedroom while flipping to page three . She went over to stand near a bureau  --  just trying to get more reading light from the window above it , she could argue . Behind her , Adrian straightened her collar . His fingers made a whispery sound . " Why do you always wear a necklace ? " he asked , very close to her ear . " Hmm ? " she said in a small voice . She turned another page , blindly . " You always wear a string of pearls , or a cameo , or today this heartshaped locket . Always something snug around your throat , and these little round innocent collars . " " It 's only habit , " she said , but her thoughts were racing . Did he meal ' that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never asked how old she was , and although she would n't have lied to him , she did n't feel any need to volunteer the truth . When he 'd told her that he himself was thirty-two , she had said , " Thirty-two ! Young enough to be my son ! " ? a deliberate exaggeration , calculated to make him laugh . She had not mentioned the ages of her children , even . Nor  | had he inquired , for like most childless people , he seemed ignorant of the enormous space that children occupy in a life . Also , he had a slightly skewed image of her husband . She could tell from some of his remarks that he was picturing Sam as beefy and athletic ( because he jogged ) and perhaps possessed of a jealous disposition . And Delia had not set him straight . All it would take was bringing the two men together once  --  inviting Adrian for supper , say , as a neighbor left wifeless and forced to cook for himself -- and the situation would lose all its potential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bly-Brice , " in that sardonic way of his ; c children would roll their eyes if she talked to him too long on the hone . But Delia made no move to arrange such a meeting . She had of so much as spoken his name to anyone in her family . And when Adrian 's hands left her collar to settle on both her shoulders and draw her closer , she did n't resist but tipped her head back to rest it against his best . " You 're such a little person , " he said . She heard the rumble of is voice within his rib cage . " You 're so little and dainty and delicate . " Compared with his wife , she supposed he meant ; and the notion tilled her upright . She walked away from him , briskly realigning pages . he circled the bed ( Rosemary 's bed ! covered with a rather seedy sateen quilt ) and approached the closet . " What I want to know , " she said over r shoulder , " is can you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours is kind of specialized , is n't it ? " " Oh , I 'm not so much as breaking even , " Adrian told her offhandedly. retty soon I 'll have to fold , I guess . Switch to something new . But I 'm used to that . Before this , I published a bulletin for rotisserie-baseball ' tiers . The closet was filled with Rosemary 's clothes  --  tops , then dresses , then pants , so there was an orderly progression from short to long ; and they hung evenly spaced , not bunched together as in Delia 's closet . cording to Adrian , Rosemary had abandoned every single one of her sessions when she left . All she took was the black silk jumpsuit she wearing and a slim black purse tucked under her arm . Why did Delia d that so alluring ? This was not the first time she had stood mesmerized front of Rosemary 's closet . " And before that , " Adrian said , " I had a quarterly for M*A*SOH us " l lc was behind her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her bent elbow .  | Delia said , " How 've you been supporting yourself all this time ? " " Well , Rosemary had a bit of an inheritance . " She closed the closet door . She said , " Did you know that before you married her ? " " Why do you ask ? " " Lately I 've been wondering if Sam married me for my father 's prac-tice , " she said . She should n't have told him . Adrian would look at her and think , Yes , she is rather homely , and her elbows are chapped besides . But he smiled and said , " If it were me , I 'd have married you for your freckles . " She went over to Rosemary 's side of the bed . She knew it was Rose-mary 's because a blown-glass perfume bottle sat next to the lamp . First she laid Dr. Adwater 's article on the nightstand , and then , as if it were the logical next step , she opened the little drawer underneath . She gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nail polish bottles . How fitting , the name Rosemary ! Rosemary was such a sophisticated herb , so sharp-tasting , almost chemical . Put too much in a recipe , and you 'd swear you were eating a petroleum product . There was nothing plain about it , nothing mild or dull . Nothing freckled . Adrian came up behind her . He turned her to face him and wrapped his arms around her , and this time she did n't move away but set her hands at his waist and strained upward to meet his kisses . He kissed her mouth , her eyelids , her mouth once more . He whispered , " Lie down with me , Delia . " Then the phone rang . He did n't seem to hear it ; he never heard it . And he never answered it . He said it was his mother-in-law , who liked him better than she liked her own daughter and was always trying to get them back together . " How do you know it 's not Rosemary ? " Delia once asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't Rosemary 's instrument of choice . " Now he did n't flinch , did n't even tense . Delia would have felt it if he had . He kissed the curve where her neck met her shoulder , and she began to notice the bed pressing the backs of her knees . But the phone continued to ring . Ten rings , eleven . Subconsciously , she must be counting . ' I'lic realization enabled her , somehow , to pull away , although she felt that she was dragging her limbs through water . " Oh , my , " she said , out of breath , and she made a great business of tucking her blouse more securely into her skirt . " I really should be ... did I leave my purse downstairs ?  | He was out of breath too . He did n't speak . She said , " Yes , I remember ! On the chair . I have to hurry ; Sam 's mother is coming to dinner . " Meanwhile she was clattering down the stairs . The extension phone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteenth . She reached the front hall and seized her purse and turned at the door to say , " You know we 're leaving tomorrow for ? " " You never stay , " he said . " You 're always rushing off as soon as you get here . " " Oh , well , I ? " " What are you afraid of ? " I 'm afraid of getting undressed in front of someone thirty-two years old , she did not say . She smiled up at him , falsely . She said , " I 'll see you after the beach , I guess . " " Ca n't you ever manage a solid block of time ? A whole night ? Ca n't you tell them you 're visiting one of your girlfriends ? " " I do n't have a girlfriend , " she said . She really did n't , come to think of it . When she married Sam she had switched generations and left everyone behind , all her old highschool classmates . " Although it 's true there 's Bootsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bootsy Officious : the thought rose out of nowhere . ) " Her kids and mine used to carpool . " " Ca n't you say you 're at Bootsy 's ? " " Oh , no , I do n't see how I ? " And then , because she guessed from the way his mouth seemed to often that he was about to kiss her again , she gave him a fluttery wave rid hurried out the door , nearly tripping over Butch on the mat . Funny , she thought , as she settled herself in her car , how often lately her high-school days came to mind . It must be this dizzy , damp , rumpled . ling as she rushed home from secret meetings ; her telltale flushed Becks , the used and smushed look of her lips when she risked a glance the rearview mirror . At a stop sign she made sure that all her buttons were buttoned , and she patted her locket into place between her collares . Once again she heard Adrian say , " Why do you always wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , Delia , " and just as in her high-school days , she felt stirred even more by the memory than by the cut itself . If she had n't already been seated , her legs might have buckled . Maybe she could say she was visiting Bootsy . Not for a whole night , course , but for an evening . Certainly no one in her family would ( her checking up on her .  | She parked in the driveway , which was clear now of all cars except for Sam 's . Smoke billowed from the yard on the other side of the house . He must be firing up the grill for dinner . She followed the trail of smoke to the little flagstone rectangle beneath the office windows . Yes , there he was , peering at the grill 's thermometer with his glasses raised . He still wore his shirt and tie and his suit trousers , minus his white coat . He looked so professional that Delia felt a flash of anxiety . Did n't he know everything ? But when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hi , Dee . Where 've you been ? " " Oh , I was . . . running a few errands , " she said . She was amazed that he did n't ask why , then , she had returned emptyhanded . He just nodded and tapped the thermometer with his index finger . Climbing the steps to the kitchen door , she felt like a woman emerging from a deep , thick daytime sleep . She walked past Eliza and drifted toward the hall . " Are you going to grill the vegetables too ? Or put them in the oven ? " Eliza called after her . There would n't be space for them on the grill . They would have to go in the oven , and she meant to say as much to Eliza but forgot , lost the words , and merely floated into the study . It was unoccupied , thank heaven . She did n't believe she could have waited till she reached the phone upstairs . She lifted the receiver , dialed Adrian 's number , let his phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of letting him know that this was not his mother-in-law . She redialed , and he answered halfway through the first ring . " Is that you ? " he asked . His voice sounded urgent , intense . She sank onto a footstool and gripped the receiver more tightly . " Yes , " she whispered . " Come back here , Delia . " " I wish I could . " " Come back and stay with me . " " I want to . I do want to , " she said . Sam 's mother said , " Delia ? " Delia slammed the phone down and jumped to her feet . " Eleanor ! " she cried . She thrust her hands in the folds of her skirt to hide their tremor . " I was just  --  I was just ? " " Sorry to barge in , " Eleanor said , " but nobody answered the door . " She advanced to kiss the air near Delia 's ear . She smelled of soap ; she was an unperfumed , unfrilled woman , sensibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a handsome face and clipped white monkish hair . " Did n't mean to interrupt your conversation . " " No , I was just winding it up , " Delia told her . " It appears that someone has left some articles on your front porch . " " Articles ? " Delia had a fleeting vision of Dr. Adwater 's article on charisma . " Badminton sets and rafts and such , scattered all about where anyone night stumble on them . " Eleanor was the kind of guest who felt it her duty to point out alarming flaws in the household . How long had their toilet been making that noise ? Did they know they had a tree limb about to come down ? Delia always countered by pretending that she was a guest herself . " Imagine that ! " she id . " Let me take you to Sam . He 's out by the grill . " " Now , I thought you were n't going to any fuss , " Eleanor told her , leading the way from the study . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packs , glow-in-the-dark chartreuse nylon , riding in front of her stomach like some sort of add-on pregnancy . It caused her to walk slightly waybacked , although ordinarily her posture was perfect . " I 'm only serving grilled chicken , " Delia said as they crossed the hall . Nothing complicated . " " Finned soup would have been plenty , " Eleanor said . She eyed a wiling apple core centered on the newel post . " Particularly in view all you need to do for your beach trip . " Did she mean this as a reproach ? Every year , Sam suggested inviting mother along to the beach , and every year Delia talked him out of which was why they always held this placatory family dinner the night ) re they left . It was n't that Delia disliked his mother . She knew that anor was admirable . She knew that she herself would never have d so magnificently in Eleanor 's circumstances  --  widowed early , forced to take a secretarial job to support herself and her young son . ( And hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use anyhow  --  a weak ineffectual , watery sort of man . ) The trouble was , in Eleanor 's presence Delia felt so inadequate . She felt so frivolous and spendthrift and organized . Their vacation was the one time she could hope to shake that feeling . Besides , she could n't imagine the Iron Mama lolling on a beach el . " Did Linda get here ? " Eleanor was asking as they entered the kitchen . Are the twins just huge ? Where are they all ? "  | It was Eliza , standing at the sink , who answered . " The twins are at the pool , " she said . " Linda just left with Susie to fetch them home . How 're you doing , Eleanor ? " " Oh , could n't be better . Is that asparagus I see ? Delia , my word , do you know what asparagus costs ? " " I found some on sale , " Delia lied . " I 'm going to roast it in the oven in this new way , really simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , if your idea of simple is asparagus and roast squab ! " " Chicken , actually . " " Just an old withered carrot would have been good enough for me , " Eleanor said . She headed for the back door , with Delia meekly shadowing her . In the side yard , Sam was tinkering with the grill knobs . " Looks about the right temperature , " he told Delia . " Hello , Mother . Good to see you . " " What 's going on with the shrubbery , son ? " Eleanor asked , looking past him . " We 're having it taken out , " he said . " Putting in a whole new bunch of plantings . " " Why , that must cost a fortune ! Could n't you just work with what you had , for gracious sake ? " " We wanted totally new , " Sam told her . ( We ? Delia thought . ) " We 're tired of working with what we had . Dee , believe I 'm ready to start cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Eleanor say , " Well , I do n't know , son . This life of yours seems mighty rich for my blood , what with asparagus for dinner and grilled pheasant . " " Chicken ! " Delia called back . Eliza must have heard too , for she was grinning to herself when Delia opened the screen door . " You bring it to him , " Delia told her . " I ca n't stand another minute . " " Oh , now , you take her too much to heart , " Eliza said as she went over to the refrigerator . Eliza seemed to find Eleanor merely amusing . But then , Eliza was n't Eleanor 's daughter-in-law . She did n't have Eleanor held up before her daily as a paragon of thrift , with her professionalquality tool chest and her twelve-column budget book and her thriceused , washed-and-dried sandwich bags . Did it ever occur to Sam that Delia and his father might well have been kindred spirits ? She gathered up the silverware , ten of everything , and went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard were muted , and she could let her mind return to Adrian . She traveled around the table , doling out knives and forks and remembering the rustle of Adrian 's fingers on her collar , his warm breath when he kissed her . But she could no longer truly feel the kiss , she discovered . Eleanor 's interruption must have startled all feeling out of her , as in the old days when the telephone rang while she and Sam were making love and she had lost her place , so to speak , and not been able to fall back into it afterward . She returned to the kitchen and found Eliza pondering in front of the glassware cupboard . " Which do we want ? " Eliza asked her . " Iced tea or wine ? " " Wine , " Delia answered promptly . From the side yard , Eleanor 's confident voice came sailing : " Have you checked the price of asparagus lately ? " " Pretty steep , is it , " Sam said equably . " Sky-high , " Eleanor told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner tonight : asparagus and grilled peacock . " Eliza was the only one who laughed . Supper was late , for one reason or another . First Linda and Susie took forever bringing the twins from the pool , and then Ramsay did n't appear till seven although he 'd promised faithfully to be home by six , and when he did show up he had his girlfriend in tow and her wan and silent six-year-old daughter . This enthralled the twins , of course , but Delia was furious . It had been understood that tonight would be strictly family . I lowever , she did n't have quite what it took to face Ramsay down in public . Seething inwardly , she scrunched two extra , mismatched place settings in among the others before she called everyone to the table . Velma , the girlfriend , was a tiny , elfin woman with a cap of glassy hair and a pert little figure set off by trim white shorts . Delia could see what her appeal was , sort of . For one thing , when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orphan place settings , as if she were accustomed to existing on the edges of events . And for another , she was so inexhaustibly vivacious that even Carroll  --  surly Carroll  --  brightened in her presence , and Sam made a point of giving her the largest piece of chicken . ( " Got to put some meat on your bones , " he said  --  not his hype of remark at all . ) Then she endeared herself to Linda by marveling at the twins ' names . " I 'm crazy about things that sound French  --  I guess  | you can tell from me naming my daughter Rosalie , " she said . " Shoot , I 'd like to go to France . The furtherest I 've been is Hagerstown a few times for hair shows . " Velma was a beautician . She worked in one of those unisex places , which was how she and Ramsay had met . He had come in for a haircut and invited her on the spot to a tea at the house of his freshman adviser . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting on the back of her chair , and beamed around the table at his family . Short though he was ( he took after Delia 's father ) , he seemed manly and imposing alongside Velma . " Although last fall I did attend a color conference in Pittsburgh , " Velma was recalling . " I stayed overnight and left Rosalie with my mother . " Rosalie , perched behind the other odd plate , raised her enormous , liquid eyes and gave Velma a look that struck Delia as despairing . " Everybody in our whole entire shop has been trained to do your colors , " Velma went on . Was she speaking to Eleanor , of all people ? Eleanor nodded encouragingly , wearing her most gracious expression . " Some people ought to wear cool colors and some people ought to wear warm , " Velma told her , " and they should never , ever cross over , though you 'd be shocked at how many try . " " Would that be determined by temperament , dear ? " Eleanor asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plate that Sam was filling for her . " Oh , mercy , Sam , " she said , " not such a great big helping ! " " I thought you asked for a breast . " " Well , I did , but just a little one . That one 's way too big for me . " He forked another and held it up . " This okay ? " " Oh , that 's huge ! " " Well , there 's nothing smaller , Mother . " " Ca n't you just cut it in half ? I could never manage to eat all that . " He put it back on the platter to cut it . " This one lady , " Velma told the others , " she was wearing pink when she came in and I 'm like , Lady , you are so , so wrong . You should be all in cools , ' I tell her , with the tone of skin you got . ' She says , Oh , but that 's why I head for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opposite . ' I could not believe her . I really could not believe her . " " Sang , dear , that 's about six times as much asparagus as I ( An possibly handle , " Eleanor said .  | " It 's three spears , Mother . How can I give you a sixth of that ? " " I just want a half a spear , if it is n't too much trouble . " " You , now , " Velma told Eliza , " you would look stunning in magenta . With your coal-black hair ? That tan color does n't do a thing for you . " " However , I 'm partial to tan , " Eliza said in her declarative way . " And Susie , I bet you had your colors done already . Right ? That aqua 's real becoming . " " It was the only thing not in the laundry , " Susie said . But she was fighting down a pleased expression around the mouth . " I dress Rosalie in nothing but aqua , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sam , I hate to be a nuisance , " Eleanor said , " but I 'm going to send my plate back to you so you can take a teensy little bit of that potato salad off and give it to someone else . " " Well , why not just keep it , Mother . " " But it 's much too large a helping , dear . " " Then eat what you can and leave the rest , why do n't you . " " Now , you know how I hate to waste food . " " Oh , just force yourself to choke the damn stuff down , then , Mother ! " " Goodness , " Eleanor said . The telephone rang . Delia said , " Carroll , would you answer that ? If it 's a patient , tell them we 're eating . " Not that she imagined a patient could be so easily dissuaded . Carroll slouched off to the kitchen , muttering something about the grown-ups ' phone , and Delia took a bite of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being kept warm in the oven too long . " For you , Mom , " Carroll said , poking his head through the door . " Well , see who it is and ask if I can call back . " " He says it 's about a time machine . " " Oh ! " Sam said , " Time machine ? " " I 'll just be a minute , " Delia said , setting aside her napkin . " Someone wants to sell you a time machine ? " Sam asked her . " No ! Not that I know of . Or , I do n't know . . . " She sank back in her seat . " Tell him we do n't need a thing , " she told Carroll . Carroll withdrew his head . It seemed to Delia that her one bite of chicken was stuck halfway  | down her throat . She picked up the basket of rolls and said , " Therese ? Marie-Claire ? Take one and pass them on , please . " When Carroll returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . She sent the butter plate after the rolls , and only then looked up to face Eliza 's steady gaze . It was Eliza she had to watch out for . Eliza was uncanny some-times . " This china belonged to your great-grandmother , " Linda was telling the twins . " Cynthia Ramsay , her name was . She was a famous Baltimore beauty , and the whole town wondered why she ever said yes to that short , stumpy nobody , Isaiah Felson . But he was a doctor , you see , and he promised that if she married him she would never get TB . See , just about her whole family had died of TB . So sure enough , she married him and moved out to Roland Park and stayed healthy as a horse all her days and bore two healthy children besides , one of them your grandpa . You remember your grandpa . " " He would n't let us roller-skate in the house . " " Right . Anyhow , your great-grandmother ordered her wedding china all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-night . " " Except for Rosalie , " Marie-Claire said . " What , sweet ? " " Rosalie 's plate is not wedding china . " " No , Rosalie 's comes from Kmart , " Linda said , and she passed the butter to Eleanor , not noticing how Rosalie 's eyes started growing even more liquid . " Heavens , no butter for me , dear , " Eleanor said . Why had he phoned her ? Delia wondered . How unlike him . He must have had something crucial to tell her . She should have taken the call . She would go to the kitchen for water or something and call him back . Grabbing the water pitcher , she stood up , and just then the doorbell rang . She froze . Her first , heart-pounding thought was that this was Adrian . He had come to take her away ; he would no longer listen to mason . A whole scenario played itself out rapidly in her mind  --  her family 's bewilderment as she allowed herself to be led from the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse-drawn carriage , it  | seemed ) , and their blissful life together in a sunlit , whitewashed room on some Mediterranean shore . Meanwhile Sam was saying , " I 've told them and told them . . . , " and he rose and strode out to the hall , apparently assuming that this was a patient . Well , maybe it was . Delia remained on her feet , straining to hear . One of the twins said , " Rosalie 's napkin is plain old paper , " and Delia had an urge to bat her voice away physically . It was a woman . An elderly , querulous woman , saying something unintelligible . So . A patient after all . Delia felt more relieved than she would have expected . She said , " Well ! Anybody want anything from the kitchen ? " But before she could turn to go , Sam was ushering in his visitor . Easily past seventy , doughy and wrinkled beneath her heap of dyed black curls and her plastering of red rouge and dark-red lipstick , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poked forth from the hem of her shapeless black dress . She was clutching a drawstring purse in both fat , ringed hands , and diamond teardrops swung from her long earlobes . All of this Delia somehow took in while at the same time registering Sam 's astonished face just beyond the woman 's shoulder . " Dee ? " he said . " This person 's saying ? " The woman asked , " Are you Mrs. Delia Grinstead ? " " Well , yes . " " I want you to leave my daughter 's husband alone . " Around the table there was a sort of snapping to attention . Delia sensed it , even though she forced her eyes to remain on the woman . She said , " I ca n't imagine what you 're talking about . " " You know who I mean ! My son-in-law , Adrian Bly-Brice . Or do n't you even keep track ? Have you collected so many paramours you ca n't tell one from another ? " Somebody snickered . Ramsay . Delia felt slightly affronted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hand . She said , " Mrs. , urn , really I ... " She hated how little-girlish her voice came out . " That is a happy marriage you 're destroying , " the old woman told her . She was stationed now at the far end of the table , just behind Sam 's empty chair . She glared at Delia from underneath lashes so thickly beaded with mascara that they shaded her face like awnings . " They may have their ups and downs , like any other young couple , " she said , " but they 're  | trying to work things out , I tell you ! They 're dating again , has he mentioned that ? Twice they 've gone to dinner at the restaurant where they got engaged . They 're thinking it might help if they started a baby . But every time I look out of my house , what do I find ? Your car , parked across the street . You at his front door kissing him , all over him , ca n't get enough of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his bedroom window for all the neighbors to gawk at . " Adrian 's mother-in-law lived across the street from him ? Delia felt burning hot . She sensed the others ' thunderstruck ex-pressions . Sam said , quietly , " Delia , do you know anything about this ? " " No ! Nothing ! " she cried . " She 's making it up ! She 's confused me with somebody else ! " " Then what 's this ? " the old woman asked , and she started tweaking at her purse . The drawstring was held tight by some sort of sliding clasp , and it took her whole minutes , it seemed , to work it loose , while everybody watched in riveted silence . Delia realized she had not released a breath in some time . She was prepared for absolutely anything to emerge from that purse  --  something steamy and lurid and reeking of sex , although what would that be , precisely ? But all the old woman brought forth in the end was a photograph . " See ? See ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung slowly from left to right . It was a Polaroid snapshot , so underexposed that it amounted to no more than a square of mangled darkness . But not till Ramsay snickered once again did Delia understand that she was safe . " Now , there , " Sam was saying , " do n't you worry , I 'm sure your daughter is very happily married . . . . " In the most chivalrous fashion , he was turning the old woman toward the door . " May I see you to your car ? " he asked . " Oh . Well . . . yes , maybe . . . yes , maybe so , " she said . She was still fumbling with her purse , but she let him guide her out . She walked beneath the shelter of his arm in a dazed , uncertain manner that filled Delia with sudden pity . " Who was that ? " Marie-Claire asked distinctly . Ramsay said , " Oh , just somebody for your aunt Delia ; you know what a siren she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverse of her , she knew , but for one split second Delia actually considered confessing , just to show them . She did n't , of course . She smiled mound the table and sat hack down and placed the water pitcher  | on her left . " Who 's for more chicken ? " she asked , and she looked brazenly into Eliza 's measuring eyes . It was Susie 's night to do the dishes , and Eleanor said she would help . She would n't think of letting Delia lift a finger , she said , after that extravagant meal . So Delia backed out of the kitchen , pretending reluctance , but instead of heading toward the porch with the others , she sped up the stairs and into her bedroom . She shut the door behind her , sat on the edge of the bed , and picked up the phone . He answered almost instantly . She had braced herself to go through that whole two-ring rigmarole , but right away he said , " Hello ? " " Adrian ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She came . " " I tried to warn you . I called your house , and even after your husband answered I went ahead and ? " " My husband answered ? When ? " " Was n't that your husband ? " " Oh , Carroll . My son . At suppertime , you mean . " " Yes , and I was hoping you would . . . That was your son ? " " Yes , my younger son . Carroll . " " But he was so old . " " Old ? He 's not old ! " " He sounded like a grown man . " " Well , he is n't , " Delia said curtly . " Adrian , why did you stand there kissing me in doors and windows when you knew your mother-in-law lived across the street ? " " So she did what she said she would , did she ? " " She came and told my family I had a paramour , ' if that 's what you mean . " Lord , Delia , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she was crazy or something , but . . . Adrian . She claimed you were happily married . " " Of course she did . You know she would want to believe that . " " She claimed you and Rosemary have started dating ; you 've gone out together twice to the restaurant where you got engaged . " " Well , that much is true . " " It is ? "  | " Just to talk things over ; sure . We do have a lot in common , after all . A lot of shared history . " " I see . " " But it was n't how you imagine . We met for dinner ! Just to eat dinner ! " " And you 're thinking of starting a baby . " " Is that what she told you ? " " Yes . " " Well , naturally it came up . " " Naturally ? " Delia cried . " I mean , Rosemary is n't getting any younger . " " No , that 's right , she must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She twined the telephone cord between her fingers . The connection was the kind with a rushing sound in the background , like long distance . " Well , probably she 's not the maternal type , though , anyhow , " Adrian said cheerfully . " Weird , is n't it ? The very thing that attracts you to someone can end up putting you off . When Rosemary and I first met , she was so . . . cool , I guess you 'd say , so cool-mannered I was bewitched , but now I see she might be too cool to be a good mother . " " How about me ? " Delia asked him . " You ? " " What is it about me that attracts you but puts you off ? " " Oh , why , nothing , Delia . Why do you ask ? " " Nothing attracts you ? " " Oh ! Well , maybe . . . well , when we met , you acted so fresh and sweet and childish , I mean childlike , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people would , for example , urn , get more involved , you were still so damn sweet and childlike . Turning all flustered , saying you should leave : you 'd think we were teenagers or something . " " I see , " Delia said . Adrian said , " Delia . Just how old is your son , anyway ? " " Ancient , " she told him . But it was herself she was referring to . She hung up and walked out of the room . Downstairs , she heard water running in the kitchen , and dishes clattering and Eleanor saying , " Susie , dear , you 're not planning to discard that , Stitch " Delia crossed the hall to stand at the screen door , wring out toward the porch . She saw no sign of the boys , who had not staved  | to talk after dinner in years ; no sign of Velma or Rosalie . But Sam and Linda sat sniping at each other in the swing . " Some of those azaleas were planted by our grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any concern of yours , " and Sam said , " Or yours either , unless you plan to start sharing a little of the burden here , " and Eliza , rocking in the cane rocker , said , " Oh , just quit it , both of you . " The twins were twirling on the front walk beneath the pole lamp , with grass blades stuck to their skin and white moths flickering above them . They had reached that highpitched , overwrought state that seizes children outdoors on summer evenings , and they were chanting at breakneck speed : " What 's life ? " " Fifteen cents a copy . " " But I only have a dime . " " Well , that 's life . " " What 's life ? " " Fifteen cents a copy . " " But I only have a dime. "  | It rained during their first evening at the beach , and their cottage roof turned out to have a leak . This was not a very fancy cottage , not an oceanfront , resort-style cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Highway i . Delia could imagine an ordinary Delaware feed-store clerk living there until about a week ago . The kitchen sink was skirted in chintz , the living-room floor was blue linoleum squiggled to suggest a hooked rug , and all the beds sagged toward the middle and creaked at the slightest movement . Still , Sam said , they should n't have to endure a puddle in the upstairs hall . He phoned the rental agent at once , using the after-hours emergency number , and insisted that the problem be seen to the first thing the following morning . " What , " Linda asked him , " do you have to have your crew of workmen even on vacation ? " And Eliza said , " Let 's just mop it up and forget it . It surely wo n't rain again while we 're here , because if it does I 'm going to site I Vim herself said nothing . She really could n't gather the strength . In their own house hack in Baltimore , workmen would be using the woc  --  k @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant that Delia  | had had to bring the cat along . ( He would n't tolerate boarding  --  had nearly pined away the one time they had tried it . ) Sam claimed they were sure to be evicted , since pets were expressly forbidden , but Delia told him that was impossible . How would anyone ever guess Vernon was there ? For he 'd been so incensed by the car trip that the instant he was set down in the cottage , he streaked to the back of a kitchen cabinet . Delia knew enough to leave him tactfully alone , but the twins would n't rest , and after supper they hovered at the cabinet door with a plate of leftovers , trying to coax him out . " Here , Vernon ! Nice Vernon . " His only response was that disheartening , numb silence cats seem to radiate when they 're determined to keep to themselves . " Oh , " Marie-Claire wailed , " what 'll we do ? He 's going to starve to death ! " " Good riddance , " Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not allowed . " Sam had been out of sorts all day , it seemed to Delia . So that first evening , when they should have been taking a stroll on the beach or walking into town for ice cream , the grown-ups sat in the kerosene-smelling , poorly lighted living room , reading tattered magazines left behind by earlier tenants and listening to the pecking of the rain against the windows . The twins were still in the kitchen , badgering Vernon . Susie and the boys had borrowed the Plymouth and driven to Ocean City , which made Delia anxious because she always pictured Ocean City as a gigantic arena of bumper cars manned by drunken college students . But she tried to keep her mind on American Deck and Patio . " If tomorrow is n't sunny , " Linda said , " maybe we could take a little day trip out past Salisbury . I want the twins to get some sense of their heritage . " " Oh , Linda , not that damn cemetery again , " Eliza said . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll take them myself . That 's what happened last year , as I recall . " " Yes , and last year both twins came back bored to tears and cranky . What do they care for a bunch of dead Carrolls and Webers ? " " ' They had a wonderful time ! And I 'd like to find Great-Uncle Roscoe 's place too , if I can . " " Well , good hunting , is all I can say . I 'm sure it 's a parking lot by now , and anyhow , Mother never got along with Uncle Roscoe . " " Eliza , why do von have to run me down at every turn ? " Linda  | demanded . " Why is it that every little thing I propose you have to mock and denigrate ? " " Now , ladies , " Sam said absently , leafing through Offshore Angler . Linda turned on him . She said , " Do n't you Now , ladies ' me , Sam Grinstead . " " Sorry , " Sam murmured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mistake . " She rose in a huff and went off to check the twins . Eliza closed her Yachting World and stared bleakly at the cover . Linda and Eliza were in their Day Two Mode , was how Delia always thought of it  --  that edgy , prickly stage after the first flush of Linda 's arrival had faded . Once , Delia had asked Eliza why she and Linda were n't closer , and Eliza had said , " Oh , people who 've shared an unhappy childhood rarely are close , I 've found . " Delia was surprised . Their childhood had been unhappy ? Hers had been idyllic . But she refrained from saying so . Linda returned with the twins , who were still fretting over Vernon , and Sam set aside his magazine and suggested a game of rummy . " Did you bring the cards ? " he asked Delia . She had not . She realized it the instant he asked , but made a show of rooting through the shopping bag on the coffee table . Jigsaw puzzles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards . " Urn . . . , " she said . " Oh , well , " Sam said , " we 'll play Parcheesi , then . " His tone was weightily patient , which seemed worse than shouting . At the bottom of the bag , Delia came across her current library book . Captive of Clarion Castle , it was called . She had started it last week and found it slow , but anything was preferable to deck plans . When Sam asked , " Are you playing too , Delia ? " she said , " I think I 'll go read in bed . " " Now ? It 's not even nine o'clock . " " Well , I 'm tired , " she told him . She said good night to the others and walked out with the front of her book concealed , although no one made any attempt to see the title . Upstairs , a new ribbon of water meandered from the sodden bath neat alongside the c  --  himnney . She ignored it and proceeded to the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musty-smelling , with one , tin-  | curtained window . For privacy 's sake she changed into her nightgown in the dark , and then she washed up in the bathroom across the hall . Back in the bedroom , she switched on the lamp and aimed its weak yellow beam in the direction of her pillow . Then she slid under the covers , wriggled her toes luxuriously , and opened her book . The heroine of this book was a woman named Eleanora , which unfortunately brought Eleanor to Delia 's mind . Eleanora 's long raven tresses and " piquant " face kept giving way to Eleanor 's no-nonsense haircut and Iron Mama jawline ; and when Kendall , the hero , crushed her to him , Delia saw Eleanor 's judging gaze directed past his broad shoulder . Kendall was Eleanora 's future brother-in-law , the younger brother of her aristocratic , suave fiance . Impetuously , Kendall kidnapped Eleanora the first time he laid eyes on her , which happened to be about fifteen minutes before her wedding . " I will never love you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tiny fists , but Kendall seized her wrists and waited , masterful and confident , until she subsided . Delia closed the book , leaving one finger inside as a marker . She stared down at the couple embracing on the cover . Not once , from the moment they met , had Adrian truly pursued her . It had all been a matter of happenstance . Happenstance had led him to ask her to pose as his girlfriend ( Who else was remotely eligible ? The woman with the baby ? The old lady at the checkout counter ? ) , and happenstance had brought them together again a few nights later . In addition , his every act had betrayed that he was still in love with his wife . Ile loved her so much that he could n't face her on his own in the supermarket ; he could n't sleep in their bedroom after she left . But Delia , like some self-deluded teenage ninny , had chosen not to see . And she had overlooked other clues as well  --  clues that revealed the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that first encounter : his rearrangement of her shopping plans , his condescending reference to Roland Park names , his trendy groceries . He was not a bad person , surely , but his mind was on his own concerns . And he was just the least bit shallow . In romance novels , this realization would have made her turn thankhilly to the man who had been waiting in the wings all along . But in real life , when she heard Sam 's step on the stairs she closed her eyes and pretended to he asleep . She felt him standing over her , and then he  | slipped her book from her hands and switched off the lamp and left the room . By morning the rain had stopped and the sun was out , shining all the brighter in the washed-clean air . The whole family set off for the ocean shortly before noon  --  the grown-ups in Sam 's Buick , the younger ones in the Plymouth with Ramsay at the wheel . Scattered puddles hissed beneath their tires as they drove across Highway i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . When the road dead-ended , they parked and fed two meters with quarters and unloaded the day 's supplies  --  the thermos jugs and blankets , towels , Styrofoam coolers , rafts , and beach bags . Delia carried a stack of towels , along with her straw tote stuffed so full of emergency provisions that the handles dug a furrow in her bare shoulder . She was wearing her pink gingham swimsuit with the eyelet-edged skirt , and navy canvas espadrilles , but no robe or cover-up , because she did n't care what Sam said , she wanted to get at least a hint of a tan . " Watch it , girls , " Linda told the twins as they lugged a cooler between them up the wooden walkway . " You 're letting the bottom drag . " " It 's Therese 's fault  --  she 's making me do all the work ! " " Am not . " " Are so . " " Did n't I tell you to take something lighter ? " Linda asked them . " Did n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then they crested the low , sandy rise , and there was the ocean , reminding them what they had come all this way for . Oh , every year it seemed Delia forgot . That vast , slaty , limitless sweep , that fertile , rotting , dog's-breath smell , that continual to-and-fro shushing that had been going on forever while she 'd been elsewhere , stewing over trivia ! She paused , letting her eyes take rest in the dapples of yellow sunlight that skated the water , and then Carroll 's armload of rafts crashed into her from behind , alai he said , " Geez , Mom . " " Oh , excuse me , " she said . She started down the wooden steps to the beach . I Ilei c were advantages to coming so early in the season . True , the w , +te , had not had time to warm up yet , but also the beach was less erov , ded ftl , +nl , e is were spread at civilized intervals , with space be  --  tweer+.  | Only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Delia could easily count the heads that bobbed farther out . She and Eliza unfolded a blanket and arranged themselves on it , while Sam worked an umbrella pole into the sand . Susie and the boys , however , walked a good twenty feet beyond before stopping to set up their own station . They had been keeping apart for several years now ; it no longer hurt Delia 's feelings . But she did always notice . " Now , you two are not stirring from here , " Linda told the twins , " until I get every inch of you covered with sunblock . " She held them close , one after the other , and slathered lotion on their skinny arms and legs . As soon as she let go of them , off they raced to the young people 's blanket . Susie 's radio was playing " Under the Boardwalk , " which had always seemed to Delia a very lonesome song . In fact , " Under the Boardwalk " was rising from other radios as well , on other blankets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own melancholy background music . " Believe I 'll go for a jog , " Sam told Delia . " Oh , Sam . You 're on vacation ! " " So ? " He shucked off his beach robe and adjusted the leather band of his watch . ( The watch was evidently part of his new exercise routine ; in just what way , Delia was n't sure . ) Then he walked down to the surf , turned , and started loping northward , a lanky figure in beige trunks and gigantic white sneakers . " At least here they have all these lifeguards who 've been trained in CPR , " Delia told her sisters . She folded Sam 's robe and packed it away in her tote . " Oh , he 'll be fine , " Eliza said . " The doctors told him to jog . " " Not to overdo , though ! " " To me he looks just the same as always , " Linda said . " If you consider that a good thing . " She was shading her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known he 'd had a heart attack . " " It was n't a heart attack ! It was chest pains . " " Whatever , " Linda said carelessly . She was wearing a one-piece swimsuit held up by a center cord that encircled her neck . It made her breasts appear to droop at either side like a pair of weary eyes . Eliza , who scorned the notion of a whole separate outfit for one week of swimming per year , wore denim shorts and a black knit tank top rolled up beneath her bra .  | Delia took off her shoes and dropped them into her tote . Then she lay down flat on her back , with the sun 's mild warmth soaking into her skin . Gradually sounds grew fainter , like remembered sounds  --  the voices of other sunbathers nearby , the high , sad cries of the seagulls , the music from the radios ( Paul McCartney now , singing " Uncle Albert " ) , and under everything , so she almost stopped hearing it , the ocean 's rush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She and Sam had come to this beach on their honeymoon . They had stayed at an inn downtown that no longer existed , and every morning , lying out here side by side with their bare , fuzzed arms just touching , they had reached such a state that , eventually , they had to rise and rush back to their room . Once even that had seemed too far , and they 'd plunged into the ocean instead , out past the breakers , and she could still remember the layers of contrast  --  his warm , bony legs brushing hers beneath the cool , silky water  --  and the fishy scent of his wet face when they kissed . But the summer after that they had the baby with them ( little Susie , two months old and fussy , fussy , fussy ) and in later years the boys , and they had seldom managed even to stretch out on their blanket together , let alone steal back to their cottage . Eliza started coming too , and Linda before she married , and their father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Delia spent her days ankle-deep in the surf tending children , making sure they did n't drown , admiring each new skill they mastered . " Watch this , Mom . " " No , watch this ! " They used to think she was so important in their lives . Someone 's feet passed in the sand with a sound like rubbing velvet , and she opened her eyes and sat up . For a moment she felt light-headed . " Your face is burning , " Eliza told her . " Better put some lotion on . " She herself was sitting sensibly in the shade of the umbrella . Linda was down in the surf , braced for an incoming wave with both plump arms outflung and her hands posed as liltingly as bird wings , and the twins had returned from the other blanket and were filling buckets near Delia . Damp sand caked Marie-Claire 's knees and made two circles on the empty-looking seat of Therese 's swimsuit . " Did Sam get back from jogging ? " Delia asked Eliza . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ) slur did n't dignify that with an answer . ( As everyone in her family well Liles% , the temperature had to be blistering , the ocean flat as glass , and not . t sea nettle sighted all day before she would venture Instead , she teat hctl for her tote hag . Delving past espadrilles , Sam 's robe , and 73 her billfold , she came up with Captive of Clarion Castle . Eliza humphed when she saw the cover . " Guess I 'll leave you to your literature , " she told Delia . She got to her feet and set off , dusting the back of her shorts in a businesslike manner . " Aunt Eliza , can we come too ? " Marie-Claire shrilled . " Wait for us , Aunt Liza ! " When they ran after her , they looked as skittery and high-bottomed as two little hermit crabs . Eleanora was beginning to notice that Kendall was not the monster she had imagined . He brought trays of food to her locked tower room and let it be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be unimpressed , but later , after he left , she reflected on the incongruity of someone so brawny and virile stirring pots at a stove . " Whew ! " Sam said . He was back . Sweat trickled down the ridged bones of his chest , and he had the drawn , strained , gasping look that always distressed Delia after his runs . " Sam , " she said , setting aside her hook , " you 're going to kill yourself ! Sit here and rest . " " No , I have to wind down gradually , " he told her . He started walking in circles around the blanket , stopping every now and then to bend over and grip his kneecaps . Drops of sweat fell from his forehead to the sand . " What have we got to drink ? " he asked her . " Lemonade , Pepsi , iced tea ? " " Iced tea sounds good . " She stood to fill a paper cup and hand it to him . He was no longer breathing so hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft and set it on the lid of the cooler . " Your nose is burning , " he told her . " I want to get a little tan . " " Melanoma is what you 're going to get . " " Well , maybe after lunch I 'll put on some ? " But he had already picked up Linda 's bottle of sunblock . " Hold still , " he said , unscrewing the cap . He started smoothing lotion across her face . It smelled like bruised peaches , an artificial , trashy smell that made her wrinkle her nose . " Turn around and I 'll do your back , " he told her . Obediently , she turned . She faced inland now , where the roofs of cottages hulked beyond the sand fence . A flock of tiny dark birds crossed the blue sky in the distance , keeping a perfectly triangular formation so that they seemed connected by invisible wires . They swung around and caught the sun , and suddenly they were white , in fact almost silver , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and once more they were  | plain black specks . Sam smoothed lotion over Delia 's shoulders . It went on warm but cooled in the breeze , tingling slightly . " Delia , " he said . " Hmm ? " " I was wondering about the old woman who came by the house Saturday night . " She grew still beneath his palm , but she felt that every one of her nerves was thrumming like a twanged string . " I know she was , maybe , peculiar , " he said . " But she had an actual photograph , and she seemed to think it really did show you and that who's-it , that what's-his-name ... " She had already turned toward him to deny it when he said , " That Adrian Fried Rice . " " Bly-Brice , " she said . For he had twisted the name on purpose . He always did that . The maid of honor at their wedding , Missy Pringle , he had kept referring to as Prissy Mingle . It was just like him to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironic glint to his voice ! Her entire marriage unrolled itself before her : ancient hurts and humiliations and resentments , theoretically forgotten but just waiting to revive at moments such as this . " His name is Adrian , Bly , Brice , " she told him . " I see , " Sam said . His face had a sheeted look . " But that woman got it all wrong . He 's nothing but an acquaintance . " " I see . " In silence , he replaced the bottle of sunblock . " You do n't believe me . " " I never said that . " " No , but you implied it . " " I surely ca n't be blamed for what you imagine I might have implied . " . " Sam said . " Of course he 's just an acquaintance . You 're not exactly the type to have an affair . But I 'm wondering how it seems to outsiders , Dee . You know ? " " No , I do n't know , " she said , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All right , " he said . " Delia . Now , why do n't you just calm do n And he leveled the air between them with hotly palms , that patronizing gesture she always found so infuriating , and tilt 1 , , . d ho her and walked toward the water . Every quarrel they had ever had , he had walked oft before it w  | resolved . He would get her all riled up and then loftily remove himself , giving the impression that he , at least , could behave like an adult . Adult ? Old man was more the case . Who else would wade into the surf in his sneakers ? Who else would pat water so fastidiously on his chest and upper arms before ducking under ? And check his watch , for Lord 's sake , when he rose ? To Delia it seemed he was timing the waves , engaging in some precise and picky ritual that filled her with irritation . She snatched her tote bag from the blanket , spun on one bare heel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had arrived without her noticing . Only a slender path wound among the umbrellas and canvas chairs and mesh playpens , and so after a few yards she changed course till she was marching alongside the ocean , on wet , packed sand that cooled the soles of her feet . This part of the beach belonged to the walkers . They walked in twos , mostly : young couples , old couples , almost always holding hands or at least matching their strides . From time to time small children cut in front of them . Delia pictured a map of the entire East Coast from Nova Scotia to Florida  --  an irregular strip of beige sand dotted with tiny humans , a wash of blue Atlantic next to it even more sparsely dotted . She herself was a dot in motion , heading south . She would keep going till she fell off the bottom of the continent , she decided . By and by Sam would think to ask , " Have you seen Delia ? " " Why , no , where could she have got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep on the move , like someone running between raindrops , and they would never , ever find her . Already , though , something was slowing her down . The first of the ca Colony condominiums towered ahead  --  ugly Sea Colony with its impassive monochrome high-rises , like a settlement from an alien galaxy . She could have made her way past , but that mysterious , Star Wars hum that the buildings always emitted chilled her so that she stopped short . In her childhood , this had been grassy marshland , with a few plain-faced cottages scattered about . In her childhood , she was almost certain , she and her father had flown homemade kites right where that complex of range plastic pyramids now shaded a modernistic sundeck . For an instant she could feel her father 's blunt fingers closing over hers on the kite ring . She brushed a hand across her eyes . Then she turned and started alking back . A lifeguard slouched on his chair , surveying the bathers inscrutably Ili behind his dark glasses . A lardy young boy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . She stepped around him and , looking ahead , spotted her family 's green-and-white umbrella and her children on their blanket just beyond . They were sitting up now , and Sam stood some distance away , still shiny after his swim . From here it did n't seem that anyone was speaking , for the children faced the horizon and Sam was studying his watch . Just that abruptly , Delia veered inland . She left the ocean behind and picked her way around sand tunnels and forts and collections of toys . When she had traversed the wooden walkway to the road , she stopped to dust her feet off and dig her espadrilles from her tote . Sam 's beach robe lay beneath them  --  a wad of navy broadcloth  --  and after a moment 's consideration , she shook it out and put it on . Her shoulders were so burned by now that they seemed to give off heat . If she had thought to get the car keys from Ramsay , she could have driven . She was n't looking forward to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return for the keys right now . But then some of the others might want to come with her , and so she decided against it . Already the ocean seemed far away and long ago , a mere whisper on this sunny paved road with its silent cottages and empty , baking automobiles and motionless rows of swimsuits on clotheslines . She cut through someone 's backyard  --  mostly sand  --  and circled an enclosure of garbage cans that smelled of crab and buzzed with glittery blue flies . Then she was facing Highway 1 . Traffic whizzed by so fast that she had to wait several minutes before she could cross . On the other side of the highway , her footsteps were the loudest sound around  --  her stiff straw soles clopping out a rhythm . Perhaps because she 'd been thinking of her father , the rhythm seemed to keep time with the song he used to sing when she was small . She stalked past screened porches , with her shoes beating out " Delia 's Gone " ? asking where she 'd been so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his bed at night he kept hearing little Delia 's bare feet . She especially liked that last line ; she always had . Except , was n't the other Delia dead ? Yes , obviously : there was mention in the very first verse of little Delia dead and gone . But she preferred to believe the woman had simply walked cit . It was more satisfying that way . 1 lei face felt sticky , and her shoulder hurt where the handles of her h ) to hag chafed her sunburn . She switched the tote to her other side . She was almost there now , anyhow . She was planning on a tall iced tea as soon as she stepped through the door , and after that a cool bath and  | a little private visit with her cat . It was time to lure Vernon from under her bed , where he had taken up residence at some point during the night . In fact , maybe she ought to do that first . She smiled at a woman carrying a suitcase out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the woman called . " Hate to leave it ! " " It 's perfect , " Delia said , and she rounded a van parked in the driveway and climbed her own steps . Inside , the dimness turned her momentarily blind . She peered up the stairwell and called , " Vernon ? " " What . " She gasped . " Somebody page me ? " a man 's voice asked . He lumbered down the stairs  --  a chubby young man with a clipboard , dressed in jeans and a red plaid shirt . His moon-shaped face , with its round pink cheeks and nubbin nose and buttonhole mouth , reassured her somewhat , but even so she could barely draw breath to ask , " Who . . . ? " " I 'm Vernon , did n't you holler my name ? I 'm here about the roof . " " Oh , " she said . She gave a shaky laugh and clutched her tote bag to her chest . " I was just calling my cat , " she told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sorry if I scared you . " " You did n't scare me ! " He squinted at her doubtfully . The satiny skin beneath his eyes glistened with sweat , which made him look earnest and boyish . " Anyhow , " Ile said . " Seems I 'll need to replace that flashing up top round the chimney . I wo n't be doing it today , though ; I got to get on back . So if those folks at the realtor 's phone , tell them I 'll be in touch , okay ? " " Okay , " Delia said . He waved his clipboard amiably and headed past her out the door . On the steps , he turned and asked , " How you like my vehicle ? " " Vehicle ? " " Ai n't it something ? " It was , in fact . She wondered how she could have missed it . Big as ; i house trailer , painted a metallic bronze with a desert landscape lighting tip one side , it occupied the whole driveway . " Got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dinky little ' frigerator ? " " You mean it 's for living in ? " " Sure , what else ? " " I thought vans would just have rows and rows of seats . "  | " Ai n't you ever been inside a RV before ? Shoot , come on and I 'll show you . " " Oh , I do n't know if I ? " " Come on ! This 'll knock your socks off . " " Well , maybe I will take a peek , " Delia said , and she followed him , still hugging her tote bag . One section of the desert scene proved to be a sliding panel . Vernon slid it open and stood back to let her see inside . When she poked her head in she found gold shag carpeting halfway up the walls , and built-in cabinets , and a platform bed at the rear with storage drawers underneath . Two high-backed seats faced the wind-shield  --  the only sign that this was , after all , a means of transporta-tion . " Gosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a load of my entertainment center . " " You have an entertainment center ? " " State of the art , " he told her . He climbed in himself , causing the van to tilt beneath his weight , and then turned to offer a hand as big as a baseball glove . She accepted it and clambered inside . The oily , exciting smell of new carpet reminded her of airports and travel . " Ta-daah ! " Vernon said . He flung open a cabinet . " What it is , " he said , " in the bottom of this here TV is a slot for a videotape , see ? Integrated VCR . Evenings , I just swivel it out and watch the latest hit movies from the bed . " " You stay here all the time ? " " Just about , " he said . " Well , more or less . Well , for now I do . " Then he sent her a look , with his head ducked . " I 'll tell you the honest truth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He seemed to think the news would disappoint her deeply . He fixed her with a worried blue gaze and waited , scarcely breathing , until she said , " Oh , really ? " " I guess I kind of gave the impression it was mine , " he said . But see , my brother 's off on this fishing trip , him and his wife . Left his van at our mom 's house in Nanticoke Landing . Told her to watch over it and not let nobody drive it . Me is who he meant . But he 's due back this afternoon and so yesterday I got to thinking . Well , durn , ' I got to thinking . ' Here 's this fully equipped RV , been setting in Mom 's yard all week and I have not so much as tried that little microwave . ' So last night I stayed in it , and this morning I took it out to make my estimates . Mom said slit do n't even want to know about it . Said not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to me , right ? What 's he going to do to me  --  haul me off to jail ? " " Maybe he wo n't find out , " Delia said . " Oh , he 'll find out , all right . Be just like him to have wrote down the mileage before he left , " Vernon told her gloomily . " You could always say you thought the battery needed charging . " " Battery . Sure . " " Does he live here ? In the van , I mean ? " " Naw . " " Well , I would , " Delia said . She bent to raise the seat of an upholstered bench . Just as she had expected , there was storage space underneath . She glimpsed woolens of some kind  --  blankets or jackets . " I would make it my year-round home , " she said . " Really ! Who needs a big old house and all those extra rooms ? " " Yeah , but my brother 's got three kids , " Vernon said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him . " Huh ? " She was inspecting the kitchen area now . It was a model of miniaturization , with a sink the size of a salad bowl and a two-burner stovetop . A dented metal percolator stood on one of the burners . " They have these coffeepots , " she told Vernon , " that you permanently install beneath the overhang of a cabinet . So you do n't waste any space . " " Is that a fact . " " Actually , there 's a whole line of under-cabinet equipment . Toaster ovens , can openers . . . electric can opener you install beneath the ? " " I believe my brother just uses the hand-cranked kind , " Vernon said . " Well , if this were mine , I 'd have everything under-cabinet . " " Hand-cranked do n't take no space at all , to speak of . " " I 'd have nothing rattling around , " Delia said , " nothing interfering , so at a moment 's notice I could hop behind the wheel and go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snail . Stop when I got tired . Park in whatever campground caught my fancy . " " Well , but campgrounds , " Vernon said . " Mostly you 'd need to reserve ahead , foi a campground . " " And next morning I 'd say , Okay ! That 's it for this place ! ' And move on . " " The rates are kind of steep too , if the campground 's halfway decent , " Vernon said . " Durn . Is that the time ? "  | He was looking at the clock above the sink . Delia was glad to see that the clock , at least , was attached to the wall . In her opinion , there was far too much loose and adrift here  --  not just the percolator but sloppily refolded newspapers and videotapes out of their boxes and castoff pieces of clothing . " What I ca n't fathom , " she said , " is how you manage to drive with these things sliding all over . Would n't you have flying objects every time you hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed , " Vernon said . " But remember this ai n't my property . And speaking of which , my brother 's due back in like a couple of hours so I reckon I better be going . " " I wish I could come too , " Delia said . " Yeah . Right . Well , look , it 's been great talking with you ? " " Maybe I could just ride along for a little tiny part of the way , " Delia said . " When  --  now ? " " Just to see how it handles on the road . " " Well , it . . . handles fine on the road , " Vernon said . " But I 'm going inland , you know ? I 'm nowhere near any beaches . Going down Three eighty past Ashford , way past Ashford , over to ? " " I 'll just ride to , urn , Ashford , " Delia said . She knew she was making him nervous . He stood staring at her , his eyebrows crinkled and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Never mind : any moment now she would let him off the hook . She would give a little corning-to-her-senses laugh and tell him that on second thought , she could n't possibly ride to Ashford . She did have a family after all , and already they must be wondering where she was . And yet here stood this van , this beautiful , completely stocked , entirely self-sufficient van that you could travel in forever , unentangled with anyone else . Oh , could n't she offer to buy it ? How much did such things cost ? Or steal it , even  --  shove Vernon out the door and zoom off , careening west on little back roads where no one could ever track her . But : " Well , " she said regretfully , " I do have a family . " " Family in Ashford ? Oh , in that case , " Vernon said . It took her a minute to understand . His eyebrows smoothed themselves out , and he leaned past her to slide the door shut . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bong as you 've got transportation back , then Speechless , Deilia made her way to the front . She sat in the passenger  | seat and perched her tote bag on her knees . Next to her , Vernon was settling behind the wheel . When he switched on the ignition , the van roared to life so suddenly that she fancied it had been jittering with impatience all this time . " Hear that ? " Vernon asked her . She nodded . She supposed it must be the engine 's vibration that caused her teeth to start chattering . Traveling down Highway r toward the Maryland border , past giant beachfurniture stores and brand-new " Victorian " developments and the jumbled cafes and apartments of Fenwick Island , Delia kept telling herself that she could still get back on her own . It would mean a long walk , was all ( which stretched longer moment by moment ) . And when they entered Ocean City , with its honky-tonk razzle-dazzle  --  well , Ocean City had buses , she happened to know . She could take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So she rode quietly , beginning to feel almost relaxed , while Vernon hunched over the wheel and steered with his forearms . He was one of those drivers who talked to traffic . " Not to pressure you or anything , fella , " he said when a car ahead of him stalled , and he clucked at four teenage boys crossing the street with their surfboards . " Are n't you-all hotshots , " he told them . Delia gazed after them . The tallest boy wore ticking-striped shorts exactly like a pair Carroll owned  --  that voluminous new fashion that billowed to mid-knee . When her family discovered she was gone , they would be baffled . Flummoxed . If she stayed away long enough , they would wonder if she 'd met with an accident . " Or could she have left on purpose ? " Sam would at last ask the children . " Did one of you say something ? Did I say something ? Was I mistaken to believe she was n't the type for an affair ? " An airy sense of exhilaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . Then after they had had time to get really concerned , she would phone . Find a booth before night fell and , " It 's me , " she would announce . " Just took a little jaunt to the country ; could one of you come pick me up ? " No harm done . So when Vernon turned onto Highway 50 and started inland ( talking now about the " differential , " whatever that was ) , she still said nothing to stop lciui . " I'hc pcicolator clanked on the stovetop ; they rattled across a bridge she 'd new : seen before and entered a bleached , pale country  | entirely unfamiliar to her . She merely stared out the window . They passed yellowing , papery houses set in the middle of careful lawns that appeared to have been hand clipped , blade by blade . They flickered through leafy woodlands . " One place he flubbed up is not opting for a CB , " Vernon said , referring evidently to his brother , but Delia was just then picturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was angry . And it occurred to her that what he might tell the children was , " Well , at least we can get things done right , now she 's gone . " " Besides which you will notice there 's no stereo , " Vernon said . " That 's my brother for you : he do n't care much for music . I say there 's something lacking in a man who do n't like music . " Maybe Eleanor would step in ( speaking of doing things right ) . Oh , Eleanor would take over gladly  --  plan all the menus a year in advance and set up one of her Iron Mama budgets . " I guess you think that 's awful , " Vernon said . " To pick fault with my own brother . " Delia said , " No , no ... Here and there , now , gaunt old dignified farmhouses stood at the end of long driveways , with crops growing all around them and lightning rods bristling on their rooftops . Imagine living in such a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding chickens , flinging corn or wheat or whatever from her capacious country apron . First she 'd have to marry a farmer , though . You always had to begin by finding some man to set things in motion , it seemed . " But I 'll be honest , " Vernon was saying . " Me and him never have been what you 'd call close . He is three years older than me and never lets me forget it . Keeps yammering about head of the family , when fact is he hardly lays eyes on our family from one month to the next . I 'm the one takes Mom grocery shopping . I 'm the one runs her hither and you for her bingo nights and her covered-dish suppers and what all . " Why did everyone maintain that men were uncommunicative ? In Delia 's experience , they talked a blue streak , especially repairmen . And Sam was no exception . Sam communicated all too well , if you asked Delia . She let her eyes follow a trailer park as they passed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes a screened extension . Whole menageries of plaster animals filled the little yards . " Now , you take this fishing trip : know who 's tending his kids ? Me  | and Mom . Course mostly it 's Mom , but time I come home from work nights , she is so wore out the rest is up to me . But do n't expect Vincent to thank me . No , sir . And if he gets wind I drove his van , he 'll have my head . " In her tote bag Delia had five hundred dollars of vacation money , split between her billfold and a deceptive little vinyl cosmetic kit . She could stay away overnight , if she really wanted to alarm them  --  take a room in some motel or even a picturesque inn . However , all she had on was her swimsuit . Oh , Lord . Her scrunchy-skirted swimsuit and her espadrilles and Sam 's beach robe . But supposing she kept the robe tightly closed . . . Viewed in a certain way , it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-quarter length ; the hem covered her knees . And hotels around here must be used to tourists , in their skimpy tourist outfits . They were approaching the edge of a town now . Vernon slowed for a traffic light . He was talking about his brother 's wife , Eunice . " I feel kind of sorry for her , if you really want to know , " he said . " Picture being married to Vincent ! " " What town is this ? " Delia asked him . " This ? Why , Salisbury . " The light changed , and he resumed driving . Delia was thinking that maybe she could just get out here . Maybe at the next red light . But the lights from then on were green , and also they had reached a residential section , very middle class and staid . And then beyond were unappealing malls , and messy commercial establishments , and somehow nothing struck her as very inviting . " It 's my belief he hits her , " Vernon was saying . " Or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they fight a lot , because half the time when they come over she wo n't look him in the face . " They were riding through open country again , and Delia was beginning to fear she had missed her last chance . It was such empty country , so cardboard flat and desolate . She gripped her door handle and gazed at a naked dirt field in which violently uprooted trees lay every which way , their roots and branches clawing air . Unexpectedly Vernon braked , then took a sharp left onto a narrow paved road . " Three eighty , " he informed her . I lc did n't seem to notice the clattering of the percolator behind them . " lint this fishing trip they 're on is supposed to be a second honeymoon . " " Honeymoon ! " Delia said . She was looking at a pasture filled with  | rusted-out cars . Around the next curve lay a ramshackle barn halfway returned to the earth  --  the ridgepole almost U-shaped , the warped gray boards slumping into waist-high weeds . Every minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , how Eunice put it to my mom , " Vernon said , " she put it that her and Vincent were going off on the boat by themselves , just the two of them together . " Delia thought that a trip alone on a fishing boat would strain the best of marriages , but all she said was , " Well , I wish them luck . " " That 's what I told Mom , " Vernon said . He swerved around an antique tractor , whose driver was wearing what looked like a duster . " I told Mom , I said , Lots of luck , when her husband is Vincent the Dweeb . ' " She should give up on him , " Delia said , forgetting it was none of her business . " Especially if he hits her . " " Oh , I 'm pretty sure he hits her . " Was that a brick building in the distance ? Yes , and a grove of dark trees that cooled and relieved Delia 's eyes , and beyond them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest accommodations here . She gathered up her tote bag and smoothed her robe around her knees . " One time Eunice dropped by the house with a puffy place on her cheekbone , " Vernon said . " And when Mom asked where she got it she said , I walked into a wall , ' which if it had been me I could have come up with a lot better story than that . " " She should leave him , " Delia said , but her mind was on the town ahead . They were passing the outskirts now  --  small white houses , a diner , a collection of men talking in front of a service station . " There 's no point trying to mend a marriage that 's got to the point of violence , " she told Vernon . Now they had reached the brick building , which turned out to be a school . DOROTHY G. UNDERWOOD HIGH SCHOOL . A street leading off just past that ended , evidently , in a park , for Delia glimpsed distant greenery and a statue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church that the steeple belonged to . Vernon was saying , " Well , I do n't know ; maybe you 're right . Like I was telling Mom the other day , I told her ? " " I believe I 'll get out here , " Delia said . " What ? " he said . Ile slowed . ' ' Here is where I think I 'll get out . " He brought the van to a stop and looked at the church . Two ladies  | in straw hats were weeding a patch of geraniums at the foot of the announcement board . " But I thought you were going to Ashford , " he said . " This is not Ashford . " " Well , still , " she said , looping the handles of her tote bag over her shoulder . She opened the passenger door and said , " Thanks for the ride . " " I hope I did n't say nothing to upset you , " Vernon told her . " No ! Honest ! I just think I 'll ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Vincent hitting her and all ? I wo n't talk about it no more if it upsets you . " No , really , I enjoyed our talk , " she told him . And she hopped to the ground and sent him a brilliant smile as she closed the door . She started walking briskly in the direction they had come from , and when she reached the street where she had seen the statue she turned down it , not even slowing , as if she had some specific destination in mind . Behind her , she heard the van shift gears and roar off again . Then a deep silence fell , like the silence after some shocking remark . It seemed this town felt as stunned as Delia by what she had gone and done .  | What kind of trees lined this street ? Beeches , she believed , judging by the high , arched corridor they formed . But she had never been very good at identifying trees . Identifying the town itself , though , was easy . First she passed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : MIKE POTTS- " BAY BOROUGH 'S FRIENDLIEST INSURANCE AGENT . " Then the Bay Borough Federal Savings Bank . And she was traveling down Bay Street , as she discovered when she reached the first intersection . But would the bay in question be the Chesapeake ? She was fairly sure she had not come so far west . Also , this did n't have the feel of a waterside town . It smelled only of asphalt . She found her explanation in the square . There , where scanty blades of grass struggled with plantain beneath more trees , a plaque at the base of the single bronze statue proclaimed : ON THIS SPOT , IN AUGUST 1863 , GEORGE PENDLE BAY , A UNION SOLDIER ENCAMPED OVERNIGHT WITH HIS COMPANY , DREAMED THAT A MIGHTY ANGEL APPEARED TO HIM AND SAID , " YE ARE SITTING IN THE BARBER 'S CHAIR OF INFINITY . " "   WHICH HE INTERPRETED AS INSTRUCTION TO ABSENT HIMSELF FROM THE REMAINDER OF THE WAR AND STAY ON TO FOUND THIS TOWNSHIP . Delia blinked and took a step backward . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did happen to be sitting , but his chair was the ordinary , non-barber kind , as near as she could make out , with a skirt of twisted bronze fringe . He gripped the chair 's arms in a manner that squashed is fingertips ; evidently he had been a nail biter . This struck Delia as oinical . She gave a snuffle of laughter and then glanced over her shoulr , fearing someone had heard . But the square was empty , its four green filches uninhabited . Around the perimeter , cars cruised past , one or o at a time , and people walked in and out of the low brick and clapboard findings , but nobody seemed to notice her . Still , she was conscious all at once of her outfit . It was n't so much is beach robe as the swimsuit underneath , the feeling of it , crumpled and bunchy and saggy . She 'd give anything for some underwear . So she rossed the little square and gazed toward the row of storefronts on the Tier side of the street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must aye been standing for a century  --  the bricks worn down like old pencil asers , the clapboards gently rubbed to gray wood  --  now held the Wild applause Video Shop , Tricia 's House of Hair , and a Potpourri Palace . nc place that seemed unchanged , though , was the dime store on the corner , with its curlicued red-and=gilt sign and a window full of flags and citing . She had been taught to buy only top-quality underwear , however else c might economize , but this was an emergency . She crossed the street and entered the dime-store smells of caramel and cheap cosmetics and Id wooden floors . Apparently the notion of consolidated checkout lanes ( I not caught on here . At each and every counter , a clerk stood by a cash register . A floss-haired girl rang up a coloring book for a child ; an erly woman bagged a younger woman 's cookie sheets . The lingerie department was staffed by a man , oddly enough ; so Delia made her selections in haste and handed them over without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white cotton underpants . The underpants came ft. ( ' to a pack . Other styles could be purchased singly , but it was the sack of three that hut fingers alighted on . Just in case I 'm away for more n one night , she ( . ought herself thinking . Then , as she counted out  | her money , she thought , But I can always use them at home , of course , too . This does n't mean a thing . Now she had her underclothes but no place to get into them , for she did n't see a rest room in the dime store . She went back outside , tucking her parcel into her tote , and looked up the street . Next door was Debbi 's Dress Shoppe . Nineteen-forties mannequins with painted-on hair sported the latest fashions  --  broad-shouldered business suits or linen sheaths shaped like upside-down triangles . Not Delia 's style at all , but at least she would find a changing booth here . She breezed in , trying to look purposeful , and snatched the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartments at the rear . " May I help you ? " a woman called after her , but Delia said , " Oh , thanks , I 'm only . . . " and disappeared behind a curtain . The underwear fit , thank heaven . ( She did her best to silence the rustling of the bag . ) It was a relief to feel contained again . She folded her swimsuit into her tote . Then she reached for Sam 's robe , but the sight of it gave her pause . It seemed so obviously a beach robe , all at once . She looked toward the dress she 'd snatched up  --  a gray knit of some sort . Way too long , she could tell at a glance , but still she slipped it off its hanger and drew it over her head . The acrid smell of new fabric engulfed her . She smoothed down the skirt , zipped the side zipper , and turned to confront her reflection . She had assumed she would resemble a child playing dress-up , for the hem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was someone entirely unexpected : a somber , serious-minded woman in a slender column of pearl gray . She might be a librarian or a secretary , one of those managerial executive secretaries who actually run the whole office from behind the scenes . " You 'll find it in the Jones file , Mr. Smith , " she imagined herself saying curtly . " And do n't forget you 're lunching with the mayor today ; you 'll want to take along the materials on the ? " " How 're we doing in there ? " the saleswoman called . " Oh , fine . " " Can I bring you anything else to try ? " " No , " Delia said . " This is perfect . " She stuffed Sam 's robe into her tote and emerged from the booth to ask , " Could you just take the tags off , please ? I think I 'll wear it home . " The saleswoman  --  an overtanned blond in a geometric **31;0;TOOLONG a dubious frown toward the hemline . " We do otter alteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortened a bit ? "   " No , thanks , " Delia told her in a starchy , secretarial voice . The saleswoman adjusted seamlessly . " Well , it certainly becomes you , " she said . Delia raised her left arm , and the woman reached for her scissors and snipped off the tags that dangled from the zipper pull . Seventy-nine ninety-five , the dress cost , not including tax . But Delia paid without a moment 's hesitation and strode out of the shop . The momentum of her exit carried her some distance , past the dime ore again and across an intersection to a row of smaller shops  --  a copy enter , a travel agent , a florist . She noticed she walked differently now , of with her usual bouncy gait but more levelly , because of her slim irt . Here is the secretary , Miss X , speeding back to her office after lunch . reparing to type up her notes for the board of directors . Just as a game , she started choosing her office , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a posh neighborhood . SCHOOLS &; TRIMBLE FAMILY DENTISTS . But there she might have to clean teeth or something . VALUE VISION OPTICIANS . But did opticians use sectaries ? EZEKIEL POMFRET , ATTORNEY . Possibly defunct , from the expressionless look of the lowered window shade . And none of these places re a HELP WANTED sign . Not that that made any practical difference . At the next intersection , she took a left . She passed a pet supply and antique store , so called ( its window full of Fiesta ware and aqua plastic trays shaped like boomerangs ) . A pharmacy . Two frame houses . A mu-and-pop grocery . Then another frame house , set so close to the eet that its porch floor seemed an extension of the sidewalk . Propped the dusty front window stood a cardboard notice , ROOM FOR RENT , cketed by limp gauze curtains . Room for rent . This would be , of course , a " boardinghouse . " The word summoned picture of the secretary tidying the covers on her spinsterly white bed ; r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her dent landlady , dressed in black , setting the dining-room table  --  the ) ard " ? for tomorrow 's breakfast . In the time it took Delia to cross the tell and ring the bell , she became so well entrenched that she hardly II the need to introduce herself to the woman who appeared at the door . ell , hi ! " the woman said . " Can I help you ? " Site did n't fit Delia 's vision of a landlady . She was plump and fortyish , uvily rouged , wearing a towering dessert tray of lavish golden curls and  | a hot-pink pantsuit . Still , she seemed to be the one in charge , so Delia said , " I 'm inquiring about the room . " " Room ? " " The room for rent , " Delia reminded her . " Oh , the room , " the woman said . " Well . I was hoping to rent to a man . " Was that even legal , nowadays ? Delia did n't know what to say next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her , opening the baggy screen door , " I just always had men . It just always seemed to work that way . I only rent out two rooms , you know , and so I had these two men , Mr. Lamb who travels weekdays and Larry Watts who was separated . But when Larry got back with his wife last April , why , I rented his room to a woman . And did I ever regret it ! " She turned , leaving the door to Delia , and started up a flight of stairs . Uncertainly , Delia followed . She had an impression of a house that had long ago been abandoned . Ovals of lighter wallpaper showed where pictures must once have hung , and the floorboards of the upstairs hall revealed the ghost of a rug . " Katie O'Connell , her name was , " the woman said . Even so short a climb had winded her . She patted her wide pink bosom with little spanking sounds . " A Delaware girl , I believe . She came to town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dear old Miss Percy die on him ? and so Katie needed a place to stay and I said , Fine , ' not having the slightest inkling : Fine , ' I told her , thinking this would be no different from renting to a man . But , oh , it was , Where 's this , where 's that , where 's my fresh towels daily , where 's my little bar of soap . . . ? ' I ani not a bed-and-breakfast , mind you . I hope you do n't think I 'm a bed-and-breakfast . " " Of course not , " Delia said . " I 'm only renting out rooms , you know ? I bought this place three years ago . Fixer-upper , they called it . I bought it after I passed my real estate exam , thought I 'd fix it up and sell it , but the way the market 's been doing I just never have found the money for that , and so I 'm living here myself and renting out two of the rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not looking for meals . This Katie , she was , Oh , let me just keep this quart of milk in your fridge , ' and not two shakes late ' she was cooking in my kitchen . Why , I do n't even cook in illy kitchen ! This is a hare-hones operation . " ( hosing it , she opened the door to the right of the stairs . Delia followed  | her into a long , narrow room , its outside wall slanting inward under the caves , a window at each end . A metal cot extended from beneath the front window , and a low , orange-brown bureau sat against the inside wall . There was a smell like a hornet 's nest  --  a dry , sharp , moldering smell that came , perhaps , from the brittle-looking tan wallpaper traced with mottled roses . " Now , Katie had drapes on these windows , " the woman said , " but she took them when she left . Left last Thursday with Larry Watts ; we think they went to Hawaii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Delia asked in confusion . " Oh , I did n't realize you knew him . Yes , once I put it all together , I recalled he did come back for his raincoat  --  raincoat he 'd left in the downstairs closet . That must be how they met . Next thing anyone knows , he 's flown the coop , leaving that little wife of his for the second time in two years . Not to mention Zeke Pomfret needing to hunt up a whole new girl now , so soon after losing poor Miss Percy . " She flung open a door at the rear , exposing a shallow closet . Three hangers tinkled faintly . " Bathroom 's off the hall , full bath with tub and shower , " she said , " and you would n't have to share it but on weekends , when Mr. Lamb gets back from his sales trips . I stay downstairs , myself . Rent is forty-two dollars a week . You want it ? " Forty-two dollars was less than a single night in most hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfyingly Spartan . Delia said , " You wan it 's all right I 'm not a man ? " The woman shrugged . " No one else has come along , " she said . Delia walked over to the cot , which was made up with white sheets and a white woolen blanket washed bald . When she tested the mattress with one palm , it sounded the same tinny note as the hangers . She said , " Definitely I want it . " " Well , great . I 'm Belle Flint , by the way . " " I 'm Delia Grinstead , " Delia said , and then she wondered if she should have used an alias . But Belle seemed reassuringly uninterested . c was fluffing her curls now in the mirror over the bureau . " So , " Delia id , " would I have to . . . sign a contract ? " " Contract ? " " I mean . . . " It must he painfully apparent that she had never arranged for her own housing before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked . " Lord , no , just pas in advance , every Saturday morning , " Belle said ,  | baring her front teeth to the mirror . " Let 's see . Today 's Monday ... . Pay me thirty dollars ; that 'll cover this week . You plan on staying here long ? " " Oh , maybe , " Delia said , deliberately vague , and she started making a to-do over digging through her tote . Belle was tilting her chin now to study the cushion of flesh beneath it . Her entire face was a cushion ; she resembled one of those lush , soft flowers , a peony or a big floppy iris . " Well , here , " Delia told her , " ten , twenty . . . , " and only then did Belle turn away from the mirror . If she was surprised to receive cash , she did n't show it . She folded the bills and tucked them into her breast pocket . " I guess you 'll want to go fetch your belongings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your key on the bureau , just in case I 'm out when you get back . I 'm showing a house at four-thirty . You wo n't be bringing a lot of stuff , I hope . " " No , I ? " " Because this room does n't have much storage space , and I hate for things to spill over . That 's how all that happened with Larry Watts and Katie : his raincoat spilled into the downstairs closet , and so naturally he forgot it when he moved . " " I 'm bringing very little , " Delia said . She would wait to come back till , say , five o'clock , when Belle was sure to be out . That way Belle would n't see she was really bringing nothing . It was now . . . Surreptitiously , she checked her watch . Three forty-five . Belle was clattering out of the room in her wedge-heeled sandals . " Rules are , the first floor is mine , " she said , pausing in the hall , " and that includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Rick-Rack 's . There 's a laundromat on East Street , and Mrs. Auburn comes Fridays to clean the rooms . We never lock the front door , but that key to your room does work , if you 're the nervous type . You got all that ? " " Yes , thanks . " " And I do n't suppose you 'll have guests , " Belle said . She gave Delia a sudden appraising look . " Men guests , that is . " " Oh ! No , I wo n't . " " Your private life is your private life , but that forty-two dollars covers utilities for one . Sheets and towels for one , too . " " I do n't even know anybody to invite , " Delia assured her . " You 're not a local girl , huh ? " " Well , no. "  | " Me neither . Till I came here with a fella , I never heard of Bay Borough , " Belle said cheerfully . " The fella did n't work out , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some information in exchange , but all she said was , " I guess I 'll wash up before I go get my things . " " Help yourself , " Belle said with a wave . And she went clomping down the stairs . Delia waited a polite half second before stepping into the bathroom . She had n't peed since ten o'clock that morning . The bathroom wallpaper  --  seahorses breathing silver bubbles  --  curled at the seams , and the fixtures were old and rust-stained , but everything looked clean . First Delia used the toilet , and then she patted her face with cool water and let it air-dry . ( The one towel belonged to the other boarder , she assumed . ) She avoided her face in the mirror ; she preferred to hang on to the image she 'd seen in the changing booth . She did glance down at her dress , though , checking it for neatness , for secretarial properness . And just before walking out , she slipped her wedding ring off her finger and dropped it into her tote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . She did n't go inside but merely stood in the doorway , claiming it  --  reveling in its starkness , now that she had it completely to herself . Clop-clop back up the street , eyes front , as if she knew where she was headed . Well , she did , more or less . Already the little town held pockets of familiar sights : the faded red soft-drink machine outside the GobbleUp Grocery , the chipped Fiesta ware in Bob 's Antiques , the stacked bags of kibble for overweight dogs in Pet Heaven . She took a right at the corner , and the green square in the distance seemed as comfortable , as well known and faintly boring , as if she had spent her childhood at the foot of Mr. Bay 's fringed chair . Ezekiel Pomfret still had his shade pulled down , but when Delia tried the door it yielded . A steep flight of stairs climbed straight ahead . A ground-floor door to the right bore , on its cloudy , pebbled glass , Ezekiel Pomfret 's name once again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , opened when Delia tried it . She stepped into a walnut-lined room with a reception desk in the center . No one sat at the desk , she was pleased to see . No one was visible anywhere , but behind another door , this one ornately paneled , she heard a man 's voice . It  | stopped and started , interspersed by silence , so she knew he must be talking on the phone . She crossed to the desk , which was bare except for a telephone and a typewriter . She lifted a corner of the typewriter 's gray rubber hood . Manual ; not even electric . ( She had worried she would find a computer . ) She gave a small , testing spin to the swivel chair behind it . Good afternoon , she would say . I 'm here to ask if .. . No , not ask . Ask was too tentative . She reached up to pat her hair , which felt as crumbly as dry sand on the beach . ( The beach ! No : shoo that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips and made sure that the trim on her tote  --  a flashy pink bow , ridiculous  --  was hidden beneath her arm . It just seemed so fateful , Mr. Pomfret , it seemed almost like a direct command , that I should learn about poor Miss Percy exactly at the moment when .. . The voice behind the door gathered energy and volume . Mr. Pomfret must be winding up his conversation . Like having something accidentally break my fall , does that make any sense ? Like I 've been falling , falling all day and then was snagged by a random hook , or caught by an outjutting ledge , and this is where I happened to land , so I was wondering whether .. . Slam of receiver , squeak of caster wheels , heavy tread on carpet . The paneled door swung open , and a big-bellied middle-aged man in a seersucker suit surveyed her over his half-glasses . " I thought I heard some-one , " he said . " Mr. Pomfret , I 'm Delia Grinstead , " she told him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-fifteen she returned to the dime store and bought one cotton nightgown , white , and two pairs of nylon panty hose . At four twentyfive she crossed the square to Bassett Bros . Shoe Store and bought a large black leather handbag . The bag cost fifty-seven dollars . When she first saw the price she considered settling for vinyl , but then she decided that only genuine leather would pass muster with Miss Grinstead . Miss Grinstead was Delia  --  the new Delia ; for after one grimacing , acidic " Ms. , " that was how Mr. Pomfret had addressed her throughout their interview . It seemed apt that she should accept this compromise -- the unmarried title , the married surname . Certainly the aproncd , coin-  | placent sound of " Mrs. " no longer applied , and yet she could n't go back to being giggly young Miss Felson . Besides , her Social Security card said Grinstead . She had drawn it from her wallet and read off the number to Mr. Pomfret ( not having had enough use of it , all these years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him she was relocating after burying her mother . A whole unspoken history insinuated itself in the air between them : the puttery female household , the daughter 's nunnish devotion . She said she had worked in a doctor 's office her entire adult life . " Twenty-two years , " she told Mr. Pomfret , " and I felt so sad to leave , but I simply could n't stay on in Baltimore with all those memories . " She seemed to have been infected with Miss Grinstead 's manner of speaking . She would never herself have used " simply " in casual conversation , and the word " memories " in that context had a certain mealymouthed tone that was unlike her . If references had been called for , she was prepared to say that her employer had recently died as well . ( She was killing off people right and left today . ) But Mr. Pomfret did n't mention references . His sole concern was the nature of her past duties . Had she typed , had she filed , taken shorthand ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I typed all the bills and correspondence and the doctor 's charts , " she said . Sam 's worn face rose up before her , along with his mended white coat and the paisley tie that he called his " paramecium tie . " She sat straighter in her chair . " I filed and manned the phone and kept the appointment book , but tiiifortunately I do not take shorthand . " " Well , no matter , " Mr. Pomfret said . " Neither did Miss Percy or Miss What's-her-name . I 've always dreamed of having a secretary with shorthand , but I guess it 's not meant to be . " There was an uncomfortable moment when he asked for her address , since she had no idea what it was . But when she mentioned Belle Flint he said , " Oh , yes , on George Street . " He added , as he made a notation , " Belle 's a real fun gal . " That was the advantage to a small town , Delia supposed . Or the disadvantage , depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should start tomorrow ; her hours were nine to five . Sorry the pay was just minimum wage , he said ( sliding his eyes over subtly to gauge her reaction ) . Also , she was expected to brew the coffee ; he hoped that was n't a problem . Of course it was n't , I ) elia said brusquely , and she rose and terminated the interview . 1 ier inipnession of Mr. Pomfret was that he was a ratan without any grain to horn , someone benign but not especially interesting ,  | and that was fine with her . In fact , she did n't much like him , and that was fine too . For the impersonal new life she seemed to be manufacturing for herself , Mr. Pomfret was ideal . Her watch said twenty minutes till five , and she had n't eaten since breakfast . Before heading back to her room , therefore , she walked to the cafe that Belle had recommended . It turned out to be not directly across from Belle 's but a few doors farther west , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boardinghouse from the window ; so she sat in the booth that offered the best view and kept watch against Belle 's return . Maybe she should have purchased a suitcase , just so she could move in openly . But it was foolish to spend money on appearances . Already her five hundred dollars had dwindled to . . . what ? Mentally she tallied it up and then winced . When the waitress arrived , she confined her order to a bowl of vegetable soup and a glass of milk . Rick-Rack 's was the kind of place where she might have eaten in high school  --  a diner , basically , linoleum floored and tile walled , with six or eight booths and a row of stools along a Formica counter . One little redhead served the whole room , and a blue-black young man , gigantically muscled and shaven skulled , did the cooking . He was grilling a cheese sandwich for the only other customer , a boy about Ramsay 's age . The smell of fried food gave Delia hunger pangs even as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup provided more vitamins for the money , and she declined the homemade pie for dessert . She paid at the register . The cook , after wiping his hands on his apron , rang up her total without comment . Next time she 'd bring something to read , she decided . She had felt awkward , munching her saltines and staring fixedly out the window . No sign of Belle back at the house . Delia unlatched the front door and felt a thin , bare silence all around her . She climbed the stairs , thinking , Here comes the executive secretary , returning from her lone meal to the solitude of her room . It was n't a complaint , though . It was a boast . An exultation . When she opened her own door the hornet's-nest smell seemed stronger , perhaps because of the afternoon heat that had penetrated the eaves . She set her belongings on the bureau and went to raise both windows . The rear window offered a view of the tiny backyard and all alley ' . The front window showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delia leaned her forehead against the screen and picked out the cafe ( N. I , " RICK " RACKLEY , PROP. ) and the hardware store and a  | brown shingled house with the bars of a crib or a playpen visible in one upstairs window . The only sounds were soothing sounds  --  occasional cars swishing past and footsteps on the sidewalk . Belle had left an old-fashioned , spindly key on the bureau , and Delia fitted it into the door and turned the lock . Then she took the tags off her new handbag , dropped her wallet inside , and hung the bag from a book in the closet . She stowed her other purchases in the bureau . ( The drawers stuck and slid out crookedly ; they were cheaply made , like the house itself . ) She hung Sam 's beach robe on a hanger . She placed her cosmetic kit in a drawer . Her tote , with its remaining litter of sun lotions and swimsuit and rubber bands and such , she boosted onto the closet shelf . Then she closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down . So . She was settled . She could look around the room and detect not the slightest hint that anybody lived here . t was twilight before Belle returned . Delia heard the clunk of a car door tit front , then loud heels on the porch . But neither woman called out greeting . In fact , Delia , who had been staring into space for who knows ow long , rose from the cot as soundlessly as possible , and tiptoed when c went over to collect some things from the bureau , and took care not t creak any floorboards when she crossed the hall to the bathroom . While she waited for the shower to run warm , she brushed her teeth and undressed , putting her underwear to soak in the sink . A second towel lid washcloth now hung on the other towel bar , she saw . She took the washcloth with her and stepped behind the shower curtain , which was crackly with age and slightly mildewed . Grime and sweat and sunblock streamed off her , uncovering a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which felt ironed flat from all at walking , seemed to be drinking up water . She lifted her face to the ray and let her hair get wet . Finally , regretfully , she shut off the faucets rid stepped out to towel herself dry . The new nightgown drifted airily over her scorched Shoulders . She chose not t ? leave her toothbrush in the holder above the sink . instead , she returned it to her cosmetic kit and carried everything back her room . Her wrung-out underclothes she draped on one of the  | hangers in the closet . This meant she would have to keep the closet door open during the night  --  a blot on the room 's sterility . Better that , though , than letting her laundry clutter the bathroom . She approved of Belle 's house rules ; she did not intend to " spill over . " She turned the bedcovers back and lay down , drawing up just the top sheet . The breeze from the window chilled her damp head , but not so much that she needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't even completely dark yet . She lay on her back with her eyes open , keeping her mind as blank as the ceiling above her . Once , though , perhaps hours later , a single thought did present itself . Oh , God , she thought , how am I going to get out of this ? But immediately afterward she closed her eyes , and that was how she fell asleep .  | Baltimore Woman Disappears , Delia read , and she felt a sudden thud in her stomach , as if she 'd been punched . Baltimore Woman Disappears During Family Vacation . She had been checking the Baltimore newspapers daily , morning and evening . There was nothing in either paper Tuesday , nothing Wednesday , nothing Thursday morning . But the Thursday evening edition , which arrived in the vending box near the square in time for Delia 's lunch hour , carried a notice in the Metro section . Delaware State Police announced early today .. . She folded the paper open to the article , glancing around as she did . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing her Idler bits of something to feed the pigeons , piece by piece . On the bench to her right , a very old man was leafing through a magazine . No e seemed aware of Delia 's presence . Mrs. Grinstead was last seen around noon this past Monday , walking Knuth along the stretch of sand between . . . Probably the police had some rule that people were not considered fussing till a certain amount of time had passed . That must be why there had been no announcement earlier . ( Searching each paper before is , Delia had felt relieved and wounded , both . Did no one realize she  | was gone ? Or maybe she was n't gone ; this whole experience had been so dreamlike . Maybe she was still moving through her previous life the same as always , and the Delia here in Bay Borough had somehow just split off from the original . ) It hurt to read her physical description : fair or light-brown hair .. . eyes are blue or gray or perhaps green . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ever looked at her ? And how could Sam have made her clothing sound so silly ? Kind of baby-doll , indeed ! She refolded the paper with a snap and then darted another glance around her . The toddler was throwing a tantrum now , a silent little stomping dance , because he 'd run out of pigeon food . The old man was licking a finger to turn a page . Delia hated when he did that . Every lunch hour he came here with a magazine and licked his way clear through it , and Delia could only hope that no one else was planning to read it after him . Like a commuter who always chooses the same seat on the train , like a guest who always settles in the same chair in the living room , Delia had managed in just three days to establish a routine for herself . Breakfast at Rick-Rack 's , over the morning paper . Lunch in the square  --  yogurt and fresh fruit purchased earlier from the Gobble-Up Grocery . Always on the southeast park bench , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task to fill the hour : Tuesday , a pair of low-heeled black shoes because her espadrilles were blistering her heels . Wednesday , a goosenecked reading lamp . Today she had planned to look for one of those immersion coils so she could brew herself a cup of tea first thing every morning . But now , with this newspaper item , she did n't know . She felt so exposed , all at once . She just wanted to scuttle back to the office . She dropped her lunch leavings into a wire trash basket and buried the newspaper underneath them . As a rule she left the paper on the bench for others , but not today . The mother was trying to stuff the toddler into his stroller . The toddler was resisting , refusing to bend in the middle . The old man had finished his magazine and was fussily fitting his glasses into their case . None of the three looked at Delia when she walked past them . Or maybe they were pretending , even the toddler ; maybe they 'd been instructed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shake . Get ahold of yourself- . It was n't as if she 'd committed any crime . She decided to go on with her routine - drop by the dime store as she 'd planned . Funny how life contrived to build up layers of things around a person .  | O 1 Already she had that goosenecked lamp , because the overhead bulb had proved inadequate for reading in bed ; and she kept a stack of paper cups and a box of tea bags on her closet shelf , making do till now with hot water from the bathroom faucet ; and it was becoming clear she needed a second dress . Last night , the first really warm night of summer , she had thought , I should buy a fan . Then she had told herself , Stop . Stop while you 're ahead . She walked into the dime store and paused . Housewares , maybe ? The old woman presiding over the cookie sheets and saucepans stood idle , twiddling her beads ; so Delia approached her . " Would you have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those things you put in a cup to heat up water ? " " Well , I know what you mean , " the old woman said . " I can see it just as plain as the nose on your face . Electric , right ? " " Right , " Delia said . " My grandson took one to college with him , but would you believe it ? He did n't read the directions . Tried to heat a bowl of soup when the directions said only water . Stink ? He said you could n't imagine the stink ! But I do n't have any here . Maybe try the hardware department . " " Thanks , " Delia said crisply , and she moved away . Sure enough , she found it in Hardware , hanging on a rack among the extension cords and three-prong adapters . She paid in exact change . The clerk  --  a gray-haired man in a bow tie  --  winked when he handed her the bag . " Have a nice day , young lady , " he said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother smiling . She had noticed that Miss Grinstead was not a very friendly person . The people involved in her daily routine remained two-dimensional to her , like the drawings in those children 's books about the different occupations . She had n't developed the easy , bantering relationships Delia was accustomed to . Leaving the dime store , she crossed Bay Street and passed the row of little shops . The clock in the optician 's window said 1:45 . She always tried her best to fill her whole lunch hour , one o'clock to two o'clock , hilt so far had not succeeded . And what would she do in wintertime , when it grew too cold to eat In the square ? For she was looking that far ahead now , it seemed  --  this Miss Grinstead with her endless , unmarked , unchanging string of days . But in Bay Borough it was always summer . That was the only season she could picture here .  | She opened Mr. Pomfret 's outside door , then the pebble-paned inner door . He was already back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual . Wurlitzer , wurlitzer , it sounded like from here . Delia shut her handbag in the bottom desk drawer , smoothed her skirt beneath her , and seated herself in the swivel chair . She had left a letter half finished , and now she resumed typing , keeping her back very straight and her hands almost level as she had been taught in high school . Authorities do not suspect drowning , the paper had said . It had n't occurred to her they might . Since Mrs. Grinstead professed a  --  how had they put it ? ? professed an aversion to water . Or something of the sort . Made her sound like a woman who never bathed . She slammed the carriage return more violently than was necessary . And that business about Eliza saying she 'd been a cat ! People must think the both of them were lunatics . This typewriter had a stiffer action than the one in Sam 's office . Her first day at work , she 'd broken two fingernails . After that she had filed all her nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grinstead 's general style . Besides , it had used up twenty minutes of an evening . She was devoting a lot of thought these days to how to use up her evenings . " Well , let 's do that ! We 'll have to get together and do that ! " Mr. Pomfret was saying , suddenly louder and heartier . Delia typed the closing ( " Esquire , " he called himself ) and rolled the letter out of the carriage . Mr. Pomfret burst through the door . " Miss Grinstead , when Mr. Miller shows up I 'll need you in here taking notes , " he said . " We 're going to send a . . . What 's that you 've got ? " " Letter to Gerald Elliott ? " Delia reminded him . " Elliott ! I met with Elliott back in ... " She checked the date at the top of the page . " May , " she said . " May fourteenth . " " Damn . " It had come to light that Delia 's immediate predecessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Ongoing . Anything red-inked by Mr. Pomfret had conveniently vanished . ( And a great deal had been red-inked , since Katie O'Connell could n't spell and apparently did nit believe in paragraphs . ) Mr. Pomfret had turned purple will Delia brought him the evidence , but Delia was secretly pleased . This way she looked so capable herself  --  so efficient , so take-charge . ( She felt  | a bit like a grade-school tattletale . ) Also , the retyping job amounted to a low-key training course . She would be sorry when she finished . " Mr. Miller is due at two-thirty , " Mr. Pomfret told her . He was leaning over her desk to sign the letter . " I want you to write down word for word everything he specifies . " " Yes , Mr. Pomfret . " He straightened , capping his pen , and gave her a sudden sharp look over his lizardy lower lids . Sometimes Delia carried her secretary act a bit too far , she suspected . She flashed him an insincere smile and gathered up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the curves . He used one of those expensive German fountain pens that leaked . " And we 'll want coffee , so you might as well fix it ahead , " he told her . " Yes , Mr. ? . Certainly , " she said . She went into his office for the carafe , then took it to the sink in the powder room . When she came back he was seated at the credenza , short thighs twisted sideways , tapping once again at his computer . For he did have a computer . He had bought it sometime just recently and fallen under its spell , which might explain his failure to notice Katie O'Connell 's filing methods . Theoretically , he was going to learn the machine 's mysterious ways and then teach Delia , but after her first morning Delia knew she had nothing to fear . The computer would sit forever in its temporary position while Mr. Pomfret wrestled happily with questions of " backups " and " macros . " Right now he was recording every dinner party he and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wines , and even seating arrangements  --  so their variables could be rotated into infinity . Delia gave the screen a scornful glance and circled it widely , heading for the coffeemaker at the other end of the credenza . Water , filter , French roast . This coffeemaker was top-of-the-line : it ground its own beans . She supposed it came from one of those catalogs that weighed down the office mail . Whenever Mr. Pomfret spotted an item he liked , he had Delia place an order . ( " Yes , Mr. Pomfret ... " ) She called i-800 numbers clear across the country , requesting a bedside clock that talked , a pocket-sized electronic dictionary , a black leather map case for the glove compartment . Her employer 's greed , like his huge belly , made Delia feel trim and virtuous . She did n't at all mind placing the orders . She enjoyed everything about this job , especially its dryness . No one received word of inoperable cancer in a lawyer 's office . No one  | told Delia how it felt to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babyhood . She pressed a button on the coffeemaker , and it started grinding . " Help ! " Mr. Pomfret shouted over the din . He was goggling at his computer screen , where the lines of text shivered and shimmied . For some reason , it never occurred to him that this always happened when the grinder was running . Delia left the office , closing the door discreetly behind her . She typed another letter , this one enumerating the corporate bylaws of an accounting firm . ( " Buy-laws , " Katie O'Connell had spelled it . ) Pursuant to our discussion , she typed , and fiscal liability , and consent of those not in attendance . She sacrificed speed for accuracy , as befitted Miss Grinstead , and corrected her rare mistakes with Wite-Out fluid on original and carbon both . Mr. Miller arrived  --  a big , handsome , olive-skinned man with a narrow band of black hair . Delia followed him into Mr. Pomfret 's office to serve their coffee and then perched on a chair , pen and pad ready . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't much to write . The question was how often Mr. Miller 's ex-wife could see their son , and the answer , according to Mr. Miller , was " Never , " which Mr. Pomfret amended to once a week and alternate holidays , hours to be arranged at client 's convenience . Then the conversation drifted to computers , and when it did n't drift back again , Delia cleared her throat and asked , " Will that be all ? " Mr. Pomfret said , " Hmm ? Oh . Yes , thank you , Miss Grinstead . " As she left , she heard him tell Mr. Miller , " We 'll see to that right away . I 'll have my girl mail it out this afternoon . " Delia settled in her swivel chair , rolled paper into the carriage , and started typing . You could have balanced a glass of water on the back of each of her hands . The only other appointment was at four  --  a woman with some stock certificates belonging to her late mother  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed a number of envelopes and folded and inserted the letters Mr. Pomfret had signed . She sealed the flaps , licked stamps . She answered a call from a Mrs. Darnell , who made an appointment for Monday . Mr. Pomfret walked past her , cramming his arms intro his suit coat " Good night , Miss Grinstead , " he said . " Good night , Mr. Pomfret " She sorted her carbons and filed them . She returned what was left  | of the Ongoing file to its drawer . She answered a call from a man who was disappointed to find Mr. Pomfret gone but would try him at home . She cleaned the coffeemaker . At five o'clock exactly she lowered all the shades , gathered the letters and her handbag , and left the office . Mr. Pomfret had given her her own key , and she already knew the crotchets of the pebble-paned door  --  the way you had to push it inward a bit before it would lock . Outside , the sun was still shining and the air felt warm and heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , letting others pass her  --  men in business suits hurrying home from work , women rushing by with plastic bags from the Food King . She dropped her letters into the mailbox on the corner , but instead of turning left there , she continued north to the library  --  the next stop in her routine . By now she had a sense of the town 's layout . It was a perfect grid , with the square mathematically centered between three streets north and south of it , two streets east and west . Look west as you crossed an intersection , and you 'd see pasture , sometimes even a cow . ( In the mornings , when Delia woke , she heard distant roosters crowing . ) The sidewalks were crumpled and given over in spots to grass , breaking off entirely when a tree stood in the way . The streets farther from the square had a tendency to slant into scabby asphalt mixed with weeds at the edges , like country highways . On Border Street , the town 's northern boundary , the Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . It was hardly more than a cottage , but the instant Delia stepped inside she always felt its seriousness , its officialness . A smell of aged paper and glue hung above the four tables with their wooden chairs , the librarian 's high varnished counter , the bookcases chockablock with elderly books . No CDs or videotapes here , no spin racks of paperback novels ; just plain , sturdy volumes in buckram bindings with their Dewey decimal numbers handwritten on the spines in white ink . It was a matter of finances , Delia supposed . Nothing seemed to have been added in the last decade . Bestsellers were nowhere to be seen , but there was plenty of Jane Austen , and Edith Wharton , and various solemn works of history and biography . The children 's corner gave off a glassy shine from all the layers of Scotch tape holding the tattered picture books together . Closing time was five-thirty , which meant that the librarian was busy with her last-niioutc shelving . Delia could place yesterday 's book on the counter without any chitchat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unobserved , since at this hour all the tables were empty . But what to choose ? She wished this place carried romances . Dickens or Dostoyevsky she would never finish in one evening ( she had an arrangement with herself where she read a book an evening ) . George Eliot , Faulkner , Fitzgerald .. . She settled on The Great Gatsby , which she dimly remembered from sophomore English . She took it to the counter , and the librarian ( a cocoacolored woman in her fifties ) stopped her shelving to come wait on her . " Oh , Gatsby ! " she said . Delia merely said , " Mmhmm , " and handed over her card . The card had her new address on it : 14 George Street . A dash in the space for her telephone number . She had never been unreachable by phone before . Tucking the book in her handbag , she left the library and headed south . The Pinchpenny Thrift Shop had changed its window display , she noticed . Now a navy knit dress hung alongside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second dress from a thrift shop ? In a town this size , no doubt everyone could name the previous owner . But after all , what did she care ? She made a mental note to come try on the dress tomorrow during lunch hour . Taking a right onto George Street , she met up with the mother and toddler who fed the pigeons in the square . The mother smiled at her , and before Delia thought , she smiled back . Immediately afterward , though , she averted her eyes . Next stop was Rick-Rack 's Cafe . She glanced over at the boardinghouse as she passed . No cars were parked in front , she was glad to see . With luck , Belle would be out all evening . She seemed to lead a very busy life . Rick-Rack 's smelled of crab cakes , but whoever had ordered them had already eaten and gone . The little redheaded waitress was filling salt shakers . The cook was scraping down his griddle . " Well , hey ! " he said , turning as Delia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling . ( She had nothing against simple courtesy , as long as it went no further . ) She settled in her usual booth . By the time the waitress came over , she was already deep in her library book , and all she said was , " Milk and the chicken pot pie , please . " Then she went on reading . Last night she 'd had soup and whole-wheat toast ; the night before that , tuna salad . Her plan was to alternate soup nights with protein nights .  | Just inexpensive proteins , though . She could n't afford the crab cakes , at least not till she got her first salary check . Paying for her new shoes on Tuesday , she had wished she could use the credit card she was carrying in her wallet . If only a credit-card trail were not so easily traced ! And then a peculiar thought had struck her . Most untraceable of all , she had thought , would be dying . But of course she had n't meant that the way it sounded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she worried she had chosen something that would n't last the evening . She forced her eyes to travel more slowly , and when her meal arrived she stopped reading altogether . She kept the book open , though , next to her plate , in case somebody approached . The waitress set out scalloped paper place mats for the supper crowd . ' I ' he cook stirred something on the burner . Two creases traversed the base of his skull ; his smooth black scalp seemed overlaid with a pattern of embroidery knots . He had made the pot pie from scratch , Delia suspected . ' I'lie crust shattered beneath her fork . And the potatoes accompanying it seemed hand mashed , not all gluey and machine mashed . She wondered whether her family had thought to thaw the casseroles she 'd packed . " If he do come , " the cook was telling the waitress , " you got to keep him occupied . Because I ai n't going to . " " You have to be around some , though , " the waitress said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . I say I wo n't keep him occupied . " The waitress looked toward Delia before Delia could look away . She had those bachelor's-button eyes you often see in redheads , and a roundchinned , innocent face . " My dad is planning a visit , " she told Delia . " Ah , " Delia said , reaching for her book . " He was n't all that thrilled when me and Rick here got married . " The waitress and the cook were married ? Delia was afraid that if she started reading now , they would think she disapproved too ; so she marked her place on the page with one finger and said , " I 'm sure he 'll accept it mutually . " " Oh , he 's accepted it , all right ! Or says he has . But now whenever Rick sees him , he always gets to remembering how ugly Daddy acted at the start . " " I ca n't staid to he around the man , " Rick said sadly . " Daddy walks into a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth stains shut . "  | " Then Teensy here feels the pressure and goes to talking a mile a minute , nothing but pure silliness . " Delia knew what that was like . When her sister Linda was married to the Frenchman , whom their father had detested .. . But she could n't tell them that . She was sitting in this booth alone , utterly alone , without the conversational padding of father , sisters , husband , children . She was a person without a past . She took a breath to speak and then had nothing to say . It was Teensy who finally broke the silence . " Well , " Teensy said , " at least we 've got ourselves a few days to prepare for this . " And she went off to wait on a couple who had just entered . When Delia walked out of the cafe , she felt she was surrounded by a lighter kind of air than usual  --  thinner , more transparent  --  and she crossed the street with a floating gait . Just inside Belle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the mail slot , but she did n't pick them up , did n't even check the names on the envelopes , because she knew for a fact that none of them was hers . Upstairs , she went about her coming-home routine : putting away her things , showering , doing her laundry . Meanwhile she kept an ear out for Belle 's return , because she would have moved more quietly with someone else in the house . But she could tell she had the place to herself . When every last task was completed , she climbed into bed with her library book . If there had been a chair she would have sat up to read , but this was her only choice . She wondered whether Mr. Lamb 's room was any better equipped . She supposed she could request a chair from Belle . That would mean a conversation , though , and Delia was avoiding conversation as much as possible . Heaven forbid they should get to be two cozy , chatty lady friends , exchanging news of their workdays every evening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the cot and leaned back . For this first little bit , the light from outdoors was enough to read by  --  a slant of warm gold that made her feel pleasantly lazy . She could hear a baby crying in the house across the street . A woman far away called , " Robbie ! Kenny ! " in that bell-like , two-note tune that mothers everywhere fetch their children home with . Delia read on , turning pages with a restful sound . She was interested in Gatsby 's story but not what you would call carried away . It would serve to pass the evening , was all . The light grew dimmer , and she switched on the goosenecked lamp  | that craned over her shoulder from the windowsill . Now the children across the street , released from the supper table , were playing something argumentative outdoors . Delia heard them for a while but gradually forgot to listen , and when she thought of them again she realized they must have gone in to bed . Night had fallen , and moths were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car door closed ; heels clopped across the porch ; Belle entered the house and went directly to the front room , where she started talking on the phone . " You know it 's got great resale value , " Delia heard , before forgetting to listen to that as well . Later she stopped reading for a moment and heard only silence , inside and out , except for the distant traffic on 380 . It was cooler now , and she felt grateful for the lamp 's small circle of warmth . She came to the end of her book , but she kept rereading the final sentence till her eyes blurred over with tears . Then she placed the book on the floor and reached up to switch the lamp off so she could sit weeping in the dark  --  the very last step in her daily routine . She wept without a thought in her head , heaving silent sobs that racked her chest and contorted her mouth . Every few minutes she blew her nose on the strip of toilet paper she kept under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a deep , shuddering sigh and said aloud , " Ah , well . " Then she blew her nose one last time and lay down to sleep . It amazed her that she always slept so soundly . The toddler wanted the pigeons to eat from his fingers . He squatted in their midst , his bulky corduroy bottom just inches from the ground , and held a crouton toward them . But the pigeons strutted around him with shrewd , evasive glances , and when it dawned on him that they would never come closer he suddenly toppled backward , not giving the slightest warning , and pedaled the air in a fury . Delia smiled , but only behind the shield of her newspaper . Today there was no further mention of her disappearance . She wondered if the authorities had forgotten her that quickly . She folded the Metro section and laid it on the bench beside her . She reached for the cup of yogurt at her left and then noticed , out of the corner of her eye , the woman who stood watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurch . She said , " Eliza ? "  | Eliza moved forward abruptly , as if she had just this second determined something . There was no one beside her . No one behind her . No one . She was wearing a dress  --  a tailored tan shirtwaist that dated from the time when they still had a Stewart 's department store . Eliza almost never wore dresses . This must be a special occasion , Delia thought , and then she thought , Why , I am the occasion . She rose , fumbling with her yogurt cup . " Hello , Eliza , " she said . " Hello , Delia . " They stood awkwardly facing each other , Eliza gripping a boxy leather purse in both hands , until Delia recollected the old man on the east bench . He appeared to be intent on his magazine , but that did n't fool her in the least . " Would you like to take a walk ? " she asked Eliza . " We could , " Eliza said stiffly . She was probably angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lunch things into the trash basket , Delia felt like a little girl hiding some mischief . She sensed she was blushing , too . Hateful thin-skinned complexion , always giving her away . She slung the strap of her handbag over her shoulder and set off across the square , with Eliza lagging a step behind as if to accentuate Delia 's willfulness , her lack of consideration . When they reached the street , Delia stopped and turned to face her . " I guess you think I should n't have done this , " she said . " I did n't say that . I 'm waiting to hear your reasons . " Delia started walking again . If she had known Eliza would pop up this way , she would have invented some reasons ahead of time . It was ridiculous not to have any . " Mr. Sudler thought you were a battered wife , " Eliza said . " Who ? " " The roofer . Vernon Sudler . " " Oh , Vernon , " Delia said . Yes , of course : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street and headed north . Delia had planned to visit the thrift shop , but now she did n't know where she was going . " He phoned us in Baltimore , " Eliza said . " He asked for ? " " Baltimore ! What were you doing in Baltimore ? " " Why , we packed up and drove there after you left . Surely you did n't think we 'd stay at the beach . " Actually , Delia had thought that . But she could see now it would  | have looked strange : everybody slathering on the suntan lotion as usual , industriously blowing air into their rafts while the policemen gave their bloodhounds a sniff of Delia 's slippers . " We thought at first you 'd gone to Baltimore yourself , " Eliza was saying . " You can imagine the fuss with the floor refinishers when all of us walked in . And when we did n't find you there . . . Well , thank goodness Mr. Sudler called . He called the house last night , inquiring how to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it I was the one who answered . So he said he could swear you had n't been kidnapped , but he hesitated to tell the police because he believed you 'd had good cause to run away . He said you got out of his van at a church that counsels battered women . " " I did ? " Delia stopped in front of the florist 's shop . " You saw their signboard and asked him to let you out , he said . " " Signboard ? " " And also there 'd been some discussion , he said , something you two were discussing that made him wonder later if . . . But he would n't tell me your whereabouts , in case your husband was dangerous . Dangerous ! ' I said . Why , Sam Grinstead is the kindest man alive ! ' I said . But Mr. Sudler was very fixed in his mind . He said , I only called to tell you she 's all right , and I want to say too I did n't know at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a ride to this certain town , ' he said , and claimed that she had family there , so I did n't see the harm . ' Then he said not to tell Sam , but of course I did tell Sam ; I could hardly keep it a secret . I told Sam I would come talk to you first and find out how things stood . " She waited . She was going to make Delia ask . All right . " And what did Sam say back ? " Delia asked . " He said well naturally I should come . He agreed completely . " " Oh . " Another wait . " And he quite understood that I could n't divulge which town it was till we 'd talked . " " I see , " Delia said . Then she said , " But how did you know the town ? " " Why , because you told Mr. Sudler you had family there . " " Family . Ummm ... " " Our mother 's family ! In Bay Borough . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , they used to . Maybe some still do , but nobody I would have heard of . You knew that . Bay Borough ? Where Aunt Henny lived ? And Great-Uncle Roscoe had his chicken farm just west of ? " " That was in Bay Borough ? " " Where else ! " " I never realized , " Delia said . " I ca n't imagine why not . Shoot , there 's even a Weber Street ? Grandmother Carroll 's maiden name . I crossed it coming in from Three eighty . And a Carroll Street just south of here , if I remember correctly . Is n't there a Carroll Street ? " " Well , yes , " Delia said , " but I thought that was the other Carrolls . The Declaration of Independence Carrolls . " " No , dear heart , it 's our Carrolls , " Eliza said comfortably . Proving her point had evidently put her in a better mood . They started walking again , passing the dentists ' office and the opti-cian 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who started this town , " Eliza said . " But only by marriage . " " The man . . . You mean George Bay ? " " Right . " " George Bay the deserter ? " " Well , you 're a fine one to talk , might I mention . " Delia flinched . " So I drove on over this morning , " Eliza said , " and inquired anywhere I thought you might be staying . Turns out there 's only one inn , not counting that sleazy little motel on Union Street . And when I did n't find you there I figured I 'd keep an eye on the square , because it looked to be the kind of square that everybody in town passes through at one time of day or another . " They were abreast of Mr. Pomfret 's office now . If he had returned from lunch he could glance out the front window and see her walking by . Miss Grinstead with a companion ! Acting sociable ! She hoped he was still in the Bay Arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliza left . They passed Pet Heaven , where a boy was arranging chew toys next to the sacks of kibble . " Delia , " Eliza said , " Mr. Sudler had it wrong , did n't he ? I mean , is there some . . . problem you want to tell me about ? " " Oh , no , " Delia said .  | " Ah . " Eliza suddenly looked almost pretty . " See there ? I told him so ! " she cried . " I told him I was positive you just needed a little breather . You know what the police said ? When we called them , this one policeman said , Folks , ' he said , I ' 11 wager any amount she is perfectly safe and healthy . ' Said , The most surprising number of women seem to take it into their heads to walk out during family vacations . ' Did you know that ? Is n't that odd ? " " Hmm , " Delia said . Her feet felt very burdensome . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had lots of experience , working in Bethany Beach and all . " " Yes , I guess he had , " Delia said . " So should we collect your things , Dee ? " " My things , " Delia said . She stopped short . " I 'm parked down next to the square . Do you have any luggage ? " Something hard rose up in Delia 's throat  --  a kind of stubbornness , only fiercer . She was taken aback by the force of it . " No ! " she said . She swallowed . " I mean , no , I 'm not going with you . " " Pardon ? " " I want . . . I need . . . I have a place now , I mean a job , a position , and a place to stay . See ? There 's where I live , " Delia said , gesturing toward Belle 's . The gauze curtains in the downstairs windows looked like bandages , she noticed . " You have a house ? " Eliza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ! Come inside ! " She took Eliza 's elbow and drew her toward the porch . Eliza hung back , her arm as rigid as a chicken wing . " A real estate agent owns it , " Delia told her as she opened the door . " A woman real estate agent , very nice . The rent is extremely reasonable . " " I should think so , " Eliza said , gazing about . " I work for a lawyer just around the corner . He 's the only lawyer in town and he handles everything , wills , estates . . . and I have total charge of his office . I bet you did n't think I could do that , did you ? You probably thought it was just because I was Daddy 's daughter that I worked in the office at home , but now I 'm finding ... " ' They were climbing the stairs , Delia in front . She wished Belle would hang sonic pictures I tither that or put up new wallpaper . " Basically this whole floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other boarder travels during  | the week . So I have a private bathroom , see ? " She waved toward it . She unlocked the door to her room and walked in . " All mine , " she said , setting her handbag on the bureau . Eliza advanced slowly . " Is n't it perfect ? " Delia asked . " I know it might seem a bit bare , but " Delia , are you telling me you plan to live here ? " " I do live here ! " " But . .. forever ? " " Yes , why not ? " Delia said . She kept feeling the urge to swallow again , but she did n't give in to it . " Sit down , " she told Eliza . " Could I offer you some tea ? " " Oh , I . . . no , thanks . " Eliza took a tighter grip on her purse . She seemed out of place in these surroundings  --  somebody from home , with that humble , faded look that home people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding this , " she said . " I could heat up the water in no time . Just have a seat on the bed . " " You are telling me you 're leaving us forever , " Eliza said , not moving . " You plan to stay on permanently in Bay Borough . You 're leaving your husband , and you 're leaving all three of your children , one of whom is still in high school . " " In high school , yes , and fifteen years old , and able to manage without me fine and dandy , " Delia said . To her horror , she felt tears beginning to warm her eyelids . " Better than with me , in fact , " she continued firmly . " How are the kids , by the way ? " " They 're bewildered ; what would you expect ? " Eliza said . " But are they doing all right otherwise ? " " Do you care ? " Eliza asked her . " Of course I care ! " Eliza moved away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no , she went to gaze out the front window . " Sam , as you might imagine , is just dumbfounded , " she announced , with her back to Delia . " Yes , he must wish now he 'd chosen Daughter One or Two instead , " Delia said . Eliza wheeled around . She said , " Delia , what is the matter with you ? Have you totally lost your senses ? Here 's this wonderful , model husband roaming the house like a zombie , and your children not knowing what to think , and the neighbors all atwitter , and the TV people and newspapers spreading our names across the state of Maryland ? "  | " It 's been on TV ? " " Every station in Baltimore ! Big color photograph flashing on the screen : Have you seen this woman ? ' " " What photo did they use ? " Delia asked . " The one from Linda 's wedding . " " That was years ago ! " " Well , most other times you were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose from . " " But that awful bridesmaid gown ! With the shoulders that looked like the hanger was still inside ! " " Delia , " Eliza said , " ever since Mr. Sudler phoned , I 've been trying to figure out what could have made you walk away from us like that . ' Fill now I 'd thought you 'd had it so easy . Baby of the family . Cute as a button . Miss Popularity in high school . Daddy 's pet . It 's true you lacked a mother , but you never seemed to notice . Well , you were only four years old when she died , and anyhow she was bedridden all your life . But now I think four years old was plenty old ! Of course you noticed ! You 'd spent those afternoons playing in her room , for God 's sake ! " " I do n't remember , " Delia said . " Oh , you must . You and she had those paper dolls . You kept them a shoe box on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't remember anything about it ! " Delia said . " Why do you keep insisting ? I have no memory of her at all ! " " And then being Daddy 's pet was kind of a mixed blessing , I guess . When he discouraged you from applying to college , took it for granted you 'd come to work in the office . . . well , I would n't blame you for resenting that . " " I did n't resent it ! " " And then his dying : of course his dying would hit you harder than ? " " I do n't see why in the world you 're bringing all this up ! " Delia said . " Just hear me out , please . Dee , you know I believe that human beings live many lives . " Ordinarily , Delia would have groaned . Now , though , she was glad to see the talk veering in a new direction . " Each life is a kind of assignment , I believe , " Eliza told her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come to earth , this little square of experience to work through . So even if your life has been troubled , I believe it 's what you 're meant to cleat with on this particular go-round. "  | " How do you know my assignment does n't include Bay Borough ? " Delia asked her . A ripple of uncertainty crossed Eliza 's forehead . Delia said , " Eliza , urn , I was wondering ... " " Yes ? " Eliza said eagerly . " Can you tell me if they brought the cat home from the beach ? " A mistake . Something closed over behind Eliza 's eyes . " The cat ! " she said . " Is that all you care about ? " " Of course it 's not all I care about , but he was kind of skulking under furniture when I left , and I did n't know if they 'd remember to ? " ' They remembered , " Eliza said shortly . " What for , I ca n't imagine . Durn creature is getting so old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old ? " Delia said . " They packed all your clothes and your casseroles too , " Eliza said . " Poor Susie had to pack your ? Delia ? Are you crying ? " " No , " Delia said in a muffled voice . " Are you crying about the cat ? " " No , I said ! " Well , she knew he was n't a kitten anymore . ( Such a merry kitten he 'd been  --  a kitten with a sense of humor , slinking theatrically around the forbidden houseplants and then giving her a smirk . ) But she had thought of him as still in his prime , and only now did she recall how he had started pausing lately as if to assemble himself before attempting the smallest leap . How she had swatted him off the counter once this spring and he had fallen clumsily , scrabbling with his claws , landing in an embarrassed heap and then hastily licking one haunch as if he had intended to take that pose all along . She widened her eyes to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliza said , " is there something you 're not telling me ? Does this have something to do with that . . . man back home ? " Delia did n't bother acting puzzled . She said , " No , it 's not about him . " Then she went to the head of the bed , causing Eliza to take a step back . She reached under her pillow for the toilet paper and blew her nose . " I must be going crazy , " she said . " No , no ! You 're not crazy ! Just a little , oh , tired , maybe . Just a little run-down . You know what I think ? " Eliza asked . " I think it took more out of you than any of us realized , tending Daddy 's last illness . You 're probably anemic too ! What you need is plain old physical rest . A vacation on your own . Yes . this was n't such a bad idea , coming to Bay Borough !  | Few more days , couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new woman . " " Maybe so , " Delia said unsteadily . " And that 's what I 'm going to tell the police . She just went back to our people 's place for some R and R , ' I 'll say . Because I do have to inform them , you know . " " I know . " " And I 'll have to tell Sam . " " Yes . " " And then I expect he 'll want to come talk things over . " Delia pressed the toilet paper to each eye . " I 'm not very good in these situations , " Eliza said . She lifted one hand from her purse and placed it on Delia 's shoulder . " You 're fine , " Delia told her . " It 's not your fault . " She felt saddened , all at once , by the fact that Eliza was wearing lipstick . ( A sugary pink , lurid against her murky skin . ) Eliza never bothered with makeup , as a rule . She must have felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have Sam bring some of your clothes with him , shall I ? " she was asking . " No , thanks . " " A dress or two ? " " Nothing . " Eliza dropped her hand . They left the room , Eliza walking ahead , and started down the stairs . Delia said , " So how 's your gardening ? " in a forced and sprightly tone . " Oh . . . , " Eliza said . She arrived in the downstairs hall . " You 'll need money , " she told Delia . " No , I wo n't . " " If I 'd realized you were n't coming back with me ... I do n't have very much on me , but you 're welcome to what there is . " " Honest , I do n't want it , " Delia said . " I 'm making this huge , enormous salary at the lawyer 's ; I could n't believe how much when he told me . " She ushered Eliza out the door . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . I feel bad enough about that . " " Oh , we managed all right , " Eliza said , eyeing a fibrous area in one porch floorboard Delia could have walked her to her car , or at least as far as the office , but that would have meant prolonging their parting . She had left her  | handbag upstairs , therefore , and she stood on the porch with her arms folded , in the attitude of someone about to go back indoors . " I 'm sure you managed , " she told Eliza . " It 's not that . It 's just that I feel bad I did n't start out with nothing . Start out . . . I do n't know . Even . " " Even ? " " Even with the homeless or something . I do n't know , " Delia said . " I do n't know what I mean ! " Eliza leaned forward and set her cheek against Delia 's . " You 're going to he fine , " she told her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my word . And meanwhile , Dee ? " She was about to turn away , but one last thought must have struck her . " Meanwhile , remember Great-Uncle Roscoe 's favorite motto . " " What was that ? " " Never do anything you ca n't undo . ' " " I 'll bear it in mind , " Delia told her . " Uncle Roscoe may have been a grump , " Eliza said , " but he did show common sense now and then . " Delia said , " Drive safely . " She stood watching after Eliza  --  that short , economical , energetic figure  --  until she disappeared down the sidewalk . Then she went back in the house for her bag . Climbing the stairs , she thought , But if you never did anything you could n't undo  --  she set a hand on the splintery railing  --  you 'd end up doing nothing at all , she thought . She was tempted to turn around and run after Eliza to tell her that , but then she could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night was The Sun Also Rises , but she did n't manage to finish it because she kept getting distracted . It was Friday , the start of the weekend . The traffic beneath her window had a livelier , more festive sound , and the voices of passersby were louder . " Hoo-ee ! Here we come ! " a teenage boy cried out . Momentarily , Delia lost track of the sentence she was reading . Around eight o'clock someone crossed the porch  --  not Belle but someone in flat-soled shoes walking slowly , as if weary or sad and she lowered her book and listened . The front door opened , he entered the house , the stairs creaked upward one step at a time . Then e doorknob across the hall gave a rattle , and she thought , Oh . The other boarder . She returned to her book , but every now and then a sound would teak through her concentration  --  a hollow cough , the sliding of metal angers along a closet rod . When she heard the shower running , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was locked . Then she limbed back into bed and reread the paragraph she had just finished . An hour or so Liter , Belle arrived . She had a man with her . Delia card his hearty , booming laugh  --  not a laugh belonging to anyone she new . " Now , be serious ! " Belle said once . The TV came on downstairs , and the refrigerator door slammed shut with a dull clunk.  | Mr. Lamb turned out to be an emaciated man in his forties , with straight brown hair and sunken eyes . Delia met him in the upstairs hall as she was setting out on some errands the following morning . " Hello , " she said , and passed on , having resolved in advance to keep their exchange to a minimum . But she need n't have worried . Mr. Lamb flattened his back against the wall and smiled miserably at his shoes , mumbling something unintelligible . He was probably no happier than she about having to share the bathroom . She was looking for a bank that kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The check was drawn on First Farmers ' , just north of the square , but she found First Farmers ' closed , and so she walked on to Bay Borough Federal . It was a cool , breezy day , with dark clouds overhead that turned the air almost lilac ; and this part of town , which she had not seen since the afternoon she arrived , now looked completely different to her . It looked out of date , somehow . The buildings were so faded they seemed not colored but hand tinted , like an antique photograph . " Would you be able to cash this for me ? " she asked the teller at Bay Borough Federal . The teller  --  a woman in squinty rhinestoned glasses  --  barely glanced at the signature before nodding . " Zeke Pomfret ? No problem , " she said . So Delia signed over the first real paycheck of her life and received a few crisp bills in return . She was surprised at how much the taxes and whatnot could eat away from a salary . Weber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She carried her head high and set her feet down with precision . She might have been the heroine in some play or movie . And her intended audience , of course , was Sam . It was n't that she looked forward to his visit , certainly . She dreaded having to explain herself ; she knew how lame and contradictory all her reasons would sound to him . And yet as early as yesterday afternoon , some part of her mind had been making its devious calculations . Let 's say it 's two hours to Baltimore . Eliza could get home around , oh , say , four-thirty , to Sam could be here by six-thirty . Maybe seven . Or supposing he decided to finish up at the office first , supposing he had to buy gas . . . And then later that night : Ile must be waiting for the weekend . That told 6e much more sensible .  | 2 1 Imagine if he came upon her this minute , heading toward the library for Saturday 's book . Or pausing on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Katy 's Kitchenware . Or stepping out of the Pinchpenny with the navy knit dress in a bag . Imagine if he were watching from the boardinghouse porch as she rounded the corner of George Street . He would see her skimming along , wearing professional gray , entirely at ease in this town he had never laid eyes on before . He would think , Could that really be Delia ? Or imagine if she climbed the stairs and found him waiting at the door of her room . " Why , Sam , " she would say serenely , and she would draw her keys from her handbag  --  so official-looking , room key and office key on Mr. Pomfret 's chrome ring  --  and open the door and tilt her head , inviting him inside . Or he would be inside already , having persuaded Belle to admit him . He would be standing at one of the windows . He would turn and see her entering with her burdens  --  her library book and her tea mug and new dress  --  and , " Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , and she would say , " Thanks . I can manage . " But he was n't there after all , and she set her things on the bed in total silence . She went downstairs to pay her rent . Belle was home , she could tell . She heard sounds from behind the celery-colored door leading off the hall . She knocked and Belle called , " Come in ! " meanwhile squeaking something , whirring something . It was a stationary bicycle , Delia discovered when she stepped inside . Belle was pedaling madly , flushed and overheated in a pink sweat suit strewn with tiny satin bows . " Whew ! " she said when she saw Delia . Her living room , like the rest of the house , seemed furnished with pieces earlier tenants had discarded . A dingy plush sofa faced the TV ; the coffee table bore a loopy design of ring-shaped water stains . " I just wanted to pay my rent , " Delia told her . " Oh , thanks , " Belle said , and without slowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Everything all right ? " " Yes , fine . " " Great , " Belle said , and she leaned diligently over the handlebars as Delia closed the door again . Delia planned to go next to the Gobble-Up for some lunch things , but lust as she was leaving the house a young man in uniform arrived on the  | porch . She thought at first he was some kind of soldier ; the uniform was a khaki color , and his hair was prickly short . " Miz Grinstead ? " he said . " Yes . " " I 'm Chuck Akers , from the Polies . " It took her a moment to translate that . " Think I could have a word with you ? " he asked . " Certainly , " she said . She turned to lead him inside and then realized she had nowhere to take him . Her bedroom was out of the question , and she could n't very well use Belle 's living room . So she turned back and asked , " What can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their business right there on the porch . " You are Miz Cordelia F. Grinstead , " he said . " Yes . " " I understand you came here of your own free will . " " Yes , I did . " " Nobody kidnapped you , coerced you ... " " Nobody else had anything to do with it . " " Well , I surely wish you had thought to make that clear before you left . " " I 'm sorry , " she said . " Next time I will . " Next time ! She wondered when on earth she supposed that would be . Saturday , Sunday . The elaborate filling of empty white hours , the glad pounce upon the most inconsequential task . Saturday evening she ate at home , little cartons of Chinese takeout , and she read Daisy Miller late into the night . Sunday breakfast was tea and a grocery-store muffin in bed , but she made an event of lunch . She ate at the Bay Arms Restaurant , a stodgy , heavily draped and carpeted establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in church clothes . Her inclination was to get the meal over with as fast as possible , but she forced herself to order a soup course , a main course , and a dessert , and she worked her way through all this iii a measured and leisurely fashion , fixing her gaze upon a point iii the middle distance . Once Susie had announced , during a particularly feminist stage in he i life , that even woman ought to learn how to cline alone in a formal restaurant without a book . Delia wished Susie could sec her now .  | In fact , maybe Sam would bring the children with him when he came . Maybe they would walk right into the Bay Arms ; it was not impossible that they would track her down . She was wearing her new navy dress from the Pinchpenny . It looked very becoming , she thought . She requested a second cup of coffee and sat on awhile . Out of nowhere , she longed for a cigarette , although she had not smoked since tenth grade . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , planning to choose that night 's reading . But the library door was locked tight and the venetian blinds were slanted shut . She should have realized the place would be closed on Sundays . Now she would have to buy a book  --  invest actual money . In the pharmacy on George Street , she found one rack of paper-backs  --  mostly mysteries , a few romances . She chose a romance called Moon Above Wyndham Moor . A woman in a long cloak was swooning on the cover , precariously supported by a bearded man who encircled her waist with his left arm while he brandished a sword with his right . Delia hid the book in her purse after she had paid for it . Then she continued toward Belle 's , taking quick , firm steps so that anybody watching would think , That woman looks completely self-reliant . But there was no one watching . She remembered how , as a child , she used to arrange herself in the front yard whenever visitors were due . She remembered one time when her great-uncle Roscoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grass and assumed a pretty pose next to it till Uncle Roscoe stepped out of his car . " Why , looky there ! " he cried . " It 's little Lady Delia . " He smelled of cough drops , the bitter kind . She had thought she retained no mental picture of Uncle Roscoe , and she was startled to find him bobbing up like this , shifting his veiny leather gladstone bag to his other hand so he could clamp her shoulder as they proceeded toward the house . But what had the occasion been ? Why had he come to visit , wearing his rusty black suit ? She suspected she would rather not know the answer . " I was singing my doll a lullaby , " she had told him in a confiding tone . She had always been such a false child , so eager to conform to the gown-ups ' views of her .  | Moon Above Wyndham Moor was a disappointment . It just did n't seem very believable , somehow . Delia kept lowering it to stare blankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She checked to see how many pages remained . She cocked her head toward the sound of Mr. Lamb 's radio . He had been playing it all weekend , though never so loudly that she could decipher the announcer 's words . On the porch overhang outside , raindrops were falling one by one . She missed the noises of the family across the street . They must have closed their windows against the weather . Is he not going to come at all , then ? On Monday morning Mr. Pomfret let her know , in a roundabout way , that he had learned the truth . " I see you have a new dress , Mrs. Grin-stead , " he said , eyeing her significantly . But she pretended not to understand , and by noon he had drifted back to " Miss . " Not that she much cared . She felt oddly lackluster today . The rain did n't help . She had been forced to buy an umbrella at the pharmacy , and during lunch hour she went to the dime store and purchased an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's standards were slipping , it appeared . She poked her hands dispiritedly through the clingy , tubelike sleeves . Because of the rain , she could n't picnic on her usual park bench , and she was n't up to the social demands of Rick-Rack 's or the Bay Arms ; so she took her cup of yogurt back to her room . She opened the front door , stepping over the mail , and started up the stairs . Then she halted and turned to look back at one of the envelopes on the floor . A cream-colored envelope  --  or more like custard-colored , really . She knew that shade well . And she knew the name embossed in brown on the upper-left-hand corner : SAMUEL A. GRINSTEAD , M. D. He would settle for just writing her a letter ? She stooped to pick it up . Mrs. Delia Grinstead , the address read ( Miss Manners would be appalled ) . George Street , house w/ low front porch next door to Gobble-Up Grocery . Bay Borough , Maryland . She took it to her room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Dear Deliat is my understanding from Eliza that . . . I le had used the office typewriter , the one with the tipsy e , and he had n't bothered to change the margins from when she 'd done the hills.The body of the letter was scarcely four inches wide .  | Delia , it is my understanding from Eliza that you have requested some time on your own due to various stresses including your father 's recent death , etc . Naturally , I would much rather you had forewarned us . You can not have been unaware of the anxiety you would cause , simply strolling off down the beach like that and disappearing . De-you Nor am I entirely clear on what " stresses " you are referring to . Of course I realize you and your father were close . But his death after all occurred four and a half months ago.and frankly I feel Perhaps you view me as one of the stresses . If so this is regrettable but I .. , vowed while I was growing up that I would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my belief I have fulfilled that vow and I do n't but if you have any complaints against me I am certainly willing to hear what they are . In the meantime you may rest assured that I will not invade your privacy . Sam He had made his first four corrections with the hyphen key  --  easy for Delia to read through  --  but the fifth was so thoroughly x-ed over that she could n't figure it out even when she held the letter up to the light . Well , no doubt that was for the best . It was probably something even more obtuse than his other remarks , and Lord knows those were obtuse enough . Not invade her privacy ! Just sit back and give up on her , as if she were a missing pet or mitten or dropped penny ! She might have known , she reflected . All this proved was how right she had been to leave . I Ier teeth were chattering , and her new sweater was no help . Instead of eating her lunch , she slipped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the one blanket , with her jaw set against the cold and her arms wrapped around her ribs , hugging her own self tightly .  | No wonder she 'd been unable to picture winter in Bay Borough ! Underneath , she realized now , she had expected Sam to come fetch her long before then . She resembled those runaway children who never , no matter how far they travel , truly mean to leave home . So anyhow . Here she was . And the entire rest of her life was stretching out empty before her . She took to sitting on her bed in the evenings and staring into space . It was too much to say that she was thinking . She certainly had no conscious thoughts , or at any rate , none that mattered . Most often she was , oh , just watching the air , as she used to do when she was small . She used to gaze for hours at those multicolored specks that swarm in a room 's atmosphere . Then Linda had informed her they were dust motes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who cares about mere dust ? But now she thought Linda was wrong . It was air she watched , an infinity of air endlessly rearranging itself , and the longer she watched the more soothed she felt , the more mesmerized , the more peaceful . She was learning the value of boredom . She was clearing out her mind She had . ulw.n s known that her body was just a shell she lived in ,  | but it occurred to her now that her mind was yet another shell  --  in which case , who was " she " ? She was clearing out her mind to see what was left . Maybe there would be nothing . Often she did n't begin the night 's reading till nine or nine-thirty , which meant she could no longer finish a novel in one sitting ; so she switched to short stories instead . She would read a story , watch the air awhile , and read another . She would mark her page with a library slip and listen to the sounds from outdoors  --  the swish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the children in the house across the street . On hot nights the older children slept on a second-floor porch , and they always talked among themselves until their parents intervened . " Am I going to have to come upstairs ? " was their father 's direst threat . That would quiet them , but only for a minute . Delia wondered if Sam knew that Carroll was scheduled for tennis lessons the middle two weeks in July . You could n't depend on Carroll to remember on his own . And did anyone recall that this was dentist month ? Well , probably Eliza did . Without Eliza , Delia could never have left her family so easily . She was n't sure if that was something to be thankful for . The fact was , Delia was expendable . She was an extra . She had lived out her married life like a little girl playing house , and always there 'd been a grown-up standing ready to take over  --  her sister or her husband or her father . Logically , she should have found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dying while her children were small . ) But instead , she had suffered pangs of jealousy . Why was it Sam , for instance , that everybody turned to in times of crisis ? He always got to be the reasonable one , the steady and reliable one ; she was purely decorative . But how had that comae about ? Where had she been looking while that state of affairs developed ? She read another story , which contained several lengthy nature descriptions . She enjoyed nature as much as the next person , but you could carry it too far , she felt . And was anybody keeping an eye on Sam 's health ? He had that tendency , lately , to overdo the exercise . But , It 's none of my concern , Delia reminded herself . His letter had freed her . No more need to count cholesterol grails , pointless to note that the Gobble-Up carried fat-free mayonnaise . She called back some of the letter 's phrases : You can not have been  | unaware and Nor am I entirely clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole neighborhood knew he had n't married her for love . Again she saw the three daughters arrayed on the couch  --  Sam 's memory , originally , but she seemed to have adopted it . She saw her father in his armchair and Sam in the Boston rocker . The two of them discussed a new arthritis drug while Delia sipped her sherry and slid glances toward Sam 's hands , reflecting on how skilled they looked , how doctorly and knowing . It might have been the unaccustomed sherry that made her feel so giddy . Just a few scattered moments , she thought , have a way of summing up a person 's life . Just five or six tableaux that flip past again and again , like tarot cards constantly reshuffled and redealt . A patch of sunlight on a window seat where someone big was scrubbing Delia 's hands with a washcloth . A grade-school spelling bee where Eliza showed up unannounced and Delia saw her for an instant as a stranger . The gleam of Sam 's fair head against the molasses-dark wood of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . And Delia walking south alongside the Atlantic Ocean . In this last picture , she wore her gray secretary dress . ( Not all such memories are absolutely accurate . ) She wore the black leather shoes she had bought at Bassett Bros . The clothes were wrong , but the look was right  --  the firmness , the decisiveness . That was the image that bolstered her . " Whenever I hear the word summer , ' " one of the three marriageable maidens announced ( Eliza , of course ) , " I smell this sort of melting smell , this yellow , heated , melting smell . " And Linda chimed in , " Yes , that 's the way she is ! Eliza can smell nutmeg day at the spice plant clear downtown ! Also anger . " And Delia smiled at her sherry . " Ah , " Sam murmured thoughtfully . Did he guess their ulterior motives ? That Eliza was trying to sound interesting , that Linda was pointing out Eliza 's queerness , that Delia was hoping to demonstrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands was as rough and warm as a mother cat 's tongue . The squat , unhappy-looking young woman approaching Miss Sutherland 's desk changed into Delia 's sister . " I wish . . . , " her father whispered , and his cracked lips seemed to tear apart rather than separate , and Ire turned his face away from her . The evening after he died , she went to bed with a sleeping pill . She was so susceptible to drugs that she seldom took even an aspirin , but she gratefully  | swallowed the pill Sam gave her and slept through the night . Only it was more like burrowing through the night , tunneling through with some blunt , inadequate instrument like a soup spoon , and she woke i --  the morning muddled and tired and convinced that she had missed sonicthing . Now she thought what she had missed was her own grief . Why that rush toward forgetfulness ? she asked herself . Why the hurry to leap past grief to the next stage ? She wondered what her father had been wishing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , and maybe he had assumed she just did n't care . Tears filled her eyes and rolled down her cheeks . She made no effort to stop them . Did n't it often happen , she thought , that aged parents die exactly at the moment when other people ( your husband , your adolescent children ) have stopped being thrilled to see you coming ? But a parent is always thrilled , always dwells so lovingly on your face as you are speaking . One of life 's many ironies . She reached for her store of toilet paper and blew her nose . She felt that something was loosening inside her , and she hoped she would go on crying all night . In the house across the street , a child called , " Ma , Jerry 's kicking inc . " But the voice was distant and dreamy , and the response was mild . " Now , Jerry ... " Gradually , it seemed , the children were dropping oft . Those who remained awake allowed longer pauses to stretch between their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally the house was silent and no one said anything more . Independence Day had passed nearly unobserved in Bay Borough  --  no parades , no fireworks , nothing but a few red-white-and-blue store windows . Bay Day , however , was another matter . Bay Day marked the anniversary of George Pendle Bay 's famous dream . It was celebrated on the first Saturday in August , with a baseball game and a picnic in the town square . Delia knew all about it because Mr. Pomfret was chairman of the Recreation Committee . He had had her type a letter proposing they replace the baseball game with a sport that demanded less space ? for instance , h o t echoes . The square , he argued , was so small and so thickly treed . But Mayor Frick , who was the son and grandson of earlier mayors and evidently reigned supreme , wrote back to say that the baseball game was a " time-honored tradition " and should continue .  | " Tradition ! " Mr. Pomfret fumed . " Bill Frick would n't know a tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the start it was always horseshoes . Then Ab Bennett came back from the minors with his tail between his legs , and Bill Frick Senior got up a baseball game to make him look good . But Ab does n't even play anymore ! He 's too old . He runs the lemonade stand . " Delia had no interest in Bay Day . She planned to spend the morning on errands and give the square a wide berth . But first she found everything closed , and then the peculiar weather ( a fog as dense as oatmeal and almost palpably soft ) lured her to keep walking , and by the time she reached the crowd she felt so safe in her cloak of mist that she joined in . The four streets surrounding the square were blocked off and spread with picnic blankets . Food booths lined the sidewalks , and strolling vendors hawked pennants and balloons . Even this much , though , Delia had trouble making out , because of the fog . People approaching seemed to be materializing , their features assembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially unsettling in the case of young boys on skateboards . Elated by the closed streets , they careened through the crowd recklessly , looming up entire and then dissolving . All sounds were muffled , cotton-padded , and yet eerily distinct . Even smells were more distinct : the scent of bergamot hung tentlike over two old ladies pouring tea from a thermos . " Delia ! " someone said . Delia turned to see Belle Flint unfolding a striped canvas sand chair . She was wearing a vivid pink romper and an armload of bangle bracelets that jingled when she sat down . Delia had n't been sure till now that Belle remembered her name ; so she reacted out of surprise . " Why , hello , Belle , " she said , and Belle said , " Do you know Vanessa ? " The woman she waved a hand toward was the young mother from the square . She was seated just beyond Belle on a bedspread the same color as the fog , with her toddler between her knees . " Have some of my spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but ? " Delia said . And then she said , " Yes , maybe I will , " and she went over to sit next to her . " Get a load of the picnic lunches , " Belle told Delia . " It 's some kind of contest ; they ought to give prizes . What did you bring " " Well , nothing , " Delia said . " A woman after my own heart , " Belle said , and then she leaned closer  | to whisper , " Selma Frick 's brought assorted hors d'oeuvres in stacked bamboo baskets . Polly Pomfret 's brought whole fresh artichokes on a bed of curried crayfish . " " Me , I 'm with the teenagers , " Vanessa said , handing her son an animal cracker . " I grab something from a booth whenever I get hungry . " She reminded Delia of those girl-next-door movie stars from the 1940s , slim and dark and pretty in a white blouse and flared red shorts , with shoulder-length black hair and bright-red lipstick . Her son was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his corduroys and long-sleeved shirt , he looked cross and squirmy , and for good reason ; Delia could feel the heat of the pavement rising through the bedspread . " How old is your little boy ? " she asked Vanessa . " Eighteen months last Wednesday . " Eighteen months ! Delia could have said . Why , she remembered that age . When Ramsay was eighteen months , he used to . . . and Susie , that was when Susie learned to .. . Such a temptation , it was , to prove her claims to membership  --  the labor pains , the teething , the time when she too could have told her baby 's age to the day . But she resisted . She merely smiled at the child 's shimmer of blond hair and said , " I suppose he gets his coloring from his father . " " Most likely , " Vanessa said carelessly . " Vanessa 's a single parent , " Belle told Delia . " Oh ! " " I have no idea who Greggie 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mouth with a tissue . " Or rather , I have a few ideas , but I could never narrow it down to just one . " " Oh , I see , " Delia said , and she turned quickly toward the ball game . Not that there was much to look at , in the fog . Apparently home plate lay in the southeast corner . It was from there she heard the plock ! of a hit . But all she could discern was second base , which was marked by a park bench . While she watched , a runner loped up to settle on the bench , and the player already seated there rose and caught a ball out of where and threw it back into the mist . Then he sat down again . The liner leaned forward with his elbows on his knees and stared intently ward home plate , although how he hoped to see that far Delia could n't imagine . " Derek Ames , " Belle informed her . " One of our best hitters . " Delia said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . "  | " Oh , George plays shortstop , " Belle said , giggling . " No , seriously : there 's a rule . Bean the statue and you walk to first . It used to count as an automatic run till Rick Rackley moved here . But you know professional athletes : they excel at any sport . It got so every time Rick came to bat , he laid old Georgie low . " " Rick Rackley 's a professional athlete ? " " Or was , till his knee went . Where 've you been living  --  Mars ? Of course , his game was football , but believe me , the Blues are lucky to have him on their side . That 's who we 're watching , in case you did n't know : the Blues versus the Grays . Blues are the new folks in town ; Grays have been here all along . Whoops ! That sounds to me like a homer . " Another Nock ! had broken through from the southeast corner . Delia gazed upward but saw only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was ( a triangle of grass behind second base ) , one player called to another , " Where 's it headed ? " " Damned if I know , " the second player said . Then , with a startled grunt , he caught the ball as it arrived in front of him . " Got it , " he called to the first man . " You see it ? " " I caught it . " " It came down already ? " " Right . " " Bobby caught that ! " the first man shouted toward home plate . " What say ? " " He caught it , " someone relayed . " Batter 's out . " " He 's what ? " " He 's out ! " " Where is the batter ? " " Who is the batter ? " Vanessa fed her son another animal cracker . " Fog on Bay Day is kind of a rule here , " she told Delia . " I do n't believe anyone 's ever once got a good look at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for Zeke Pomfret ? " " Well . . . he 's okay , " Delia said . She supposed she should have expected that her job would be common knowledge . " He 's a real fine lawyer , you know . If you decide to go ahead with your divorce , you could do worse than hire Zeke . " Delia blinked . " Yes , he did just great with my ex-boyfriend 's , " Belle told her . " And  | he got Vanessa here 's brother Jip out of jail , when Jip hit a spell of had luck once . " " I have n't given much thought to , um , divorce , " Delia said . " Well , sure ! No hurry ! And anyhow , my ex-boyfriend 's case was totally different from yours . " What did they imagine Delia 's case was ? She decided not to ask . Belle was rummaging through her big purse . She pulled forth a palegreen bottle and a stack of paper cups . " Wine ? " she asked the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Polly Pomfret . Yes , Norton 's case was so straightforward , for one thing . He 'd only been married a year . In fact , we met on his first anniversary . Met at a Gamblers ' Weekend Special in Atlantic City , where he 'd brought his wife to celebrate . He and I just sort of . . . gravitated , you know ? " She passed Delia a cup of white wine . " It helped that his wife was one of those people who end up soldered to their slot machines . So one-two-three I move to Bay Borough , and we rent a little apartment together , and Zeke Pomfret goes to work on Norton 's divorce . " The wine had a metallic aftertaste , like tinned grapefruit juice . Delia cradled the cup in both hands . She said , " I 'm not really planning anything that definite just yet . " " Well , of course you 're not . " " I 'm really feeling sort of . . . blank right now . You know ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously . In the square , the inning must have ended . The players they had been watching vanished and new players took shape , a new second baseman floating up by degrees and solidifying on the bench . She dreamed Sam was driving a truck across the front lawn in Baltimore and the children were playing hide-and-seek directly in his path . They were little , though ; not their present-day selves . She tried to call out and warn them , but her voice did n't work , and they were all run over . Then Ramsay stood up again , holding his wrist , and Sam climbed out of the truck and he fell down and tried to get up again , fell down and tried to get up , and the sight made Delia feel as if a huge , ragged wound had ripped open in her chest . When she woke , her cheeks were wet . She had thought she was darting to lose hem habit of crying at night , but now tears flooded her eyes and she gave in to wrenching sobs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little brown sandals she 'd forgotten he 'd ever owned .  | She saw her children lined up on the lawn , still in their younger versions before they 'd turned hard-shelled and spiky , before the boys had grown whiskers and Susie bought a diary with an unpickable brass lock . Those were the children she longed for . One evening in September , she returned from work to find several envelopes bearing her name scattered across the hall floor . She knew they must be birthday cards  --  she was turning forty-one tomorrow  --  and she could tell they were from her family because of the wordy address . ( House wl low front porch . . . ) The first card showed a wheelbarrow full of daisies . A BIRTHDAY WISH , it said , and inside , Friendship and health l I Ai lighter and cheer / Now and through l The coming year . The signature was just Ramsay , with the tail of the y wandering off across the page in a halfhearted manner . She carried the rest of her mail upstairs . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card was signed . ( Heartiest Congratulations and Many Happy Returns . ) And nothing at all from Carroll , though she riffled through the envelopes twice . Well , it was easy to see what had happened . These cards were Eliza 's idea . She had coaxed and cajoled the whole family into sending them . " All I 'm asking , " was a phrase she would have used . Or , " No one should have to pass a birthday without . . . " But Carroll , the stubborn one , had flatly refused . And Sam ? Delia opened his envelope next . A color photo of roses in a blue-and-white porcelain vase . Barrels of joy / Bushels of glee ... Signed , Sam . Then a letter from Linda , in Michigan . I want you to know that I sincerely wish you a happy birthday , she wrote . I do n't hold it against you that you absconded like that even though it did mean we had to cut short our vacation which is the twins ' only chance each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a good day . Below her signature were Marie-Claire 's and Therese 's  --  a prim strand of copperplate and a left-hander 's gnarly crumple . Dear Delia , Eliza wrote , on yet another rhymed card . We are all fine but we hope you 'll soon he home . I am taking care of the office paperwork liar now , and all three kids have started hack to school . Bootsy Fisher has phoned several times and alai some of the  | neighbors but I tell everyone you 're visiting relatives at the moment . I hope you have a good birthday . I remember the night you were born as if it were just last week . Daddy let Linda and me wait in the waiting room with the fathers , and when the nurse came out she told us , " Congratulations , kids , you can form a singing trio now and go on Arthur Godfrey , " and that 's how we knew you were a girl . I do miss you . Love , Eliza Delia kept that one . The others she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discard Eliza 's too . Afterward she sat on her bed a long while , pressing her fingertips to her lips . On her actual birthday , a package arrived from Sam 's mother . It was roughly the size of a book , too thick to fit through the mail slot , so it stood inside the screen door , where Delia found it when she came home . She groaned when she recognized the writing . Eleanor was known for her extremely practical gifts  --  a metric-conversion tape measure , say , or a battery recharger , always wrapped in wrinkled paper saved from Christias . This time , as Delia discovered when she took the package upstairs , was a miniature reading light on a neck cord . Well , in fact ... , s h e reflected . It would probably work much better than her lamp . She tucked it under her pillow , next to her stash of toilet paper . There was a letter too , on Eleanor 's plain buff stationery : Dear Delia , This is just a little something I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've traveled myself , the reading light has generally been miserable . Perhaps you 're having the same experience . If not , just pass this along to your favorite charity . ( Lately I 've been most dissatisfied with Goodwill but continue to feel that Retarded Citizens is a worthwhile organization . ) My best wishes for your birthday . Love , Eleanor Delia flipped it over , but all she found on the back was RECYCLED PAPER RECYCLED PAPER RECYCLED PAPER running across the bottom . She kid expected indnignation , or at least a few reproaches .  | She remembered how , when she and Sam were first engaged , she had entertained such high hopes for Eleanor . She had thought she was finally getting a mother of her own . But that was before they met . Eleanor came to supper at the Felsons ' , arriving directly from the Home for Wayward Girls , where she volunteered as a typing teacher twice a week . Once the introductions were over , she hardly gave Delia a glance . All she talked about was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staggering contrast of this meal  --  which , by the way , was merely pot roast sprinkled with onion-soup mix and an iceberg lettuce salad . " I asked this one poor child , " Eleanor said , " I asked , Dear , could your people buy you a typewriter so you could work from your house after the baby arrives ? ' And she said , Miss , my family 's so poor they ca n't even afford shampoo . ' " A basket of rolls appeared before her . Eleanor gazed into it , looking puzzled , and passed it on . " I do n't know what In a &; her choose that example , of all things , " she said . " Shampoo . " ( Why was it that so many voices came wafting back to Delia these days ? Sometimes as she fell asleep she heard them nattering on without her , as if everybody she 'd ever known sat around her , conversing . Like people in a sickroom , she thought . Like people at a deathbed . ) Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer gadget to freshen clothes during trips . This was some years back ; Delia could n't remember what she 'd done with it . But the thing was , here in Bay Borough she could have put it to use . She could have touched tip her office dresses , both of which had grown somewhat puckery at the seams after repeated hand laundering . It would certainly have been preferable to buying an iron and ironing board . Oh , why had n't she kept the steamer ? Why had n't she brought it with her ? How could she have been so shortsighted , and so ungrateful ? She did n't answer any of the birthday cards , but etiquette demanded a thank-you note to Eleanor . The little light is very convenient , she wrote . Much better than the goosenecked lamp I 've been reading by up till now . So I 've moved the lamp to the bureau which means I do n't have to use the ceiling bulb and therefore the room looks much softer . In this manner she contrived to covet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . at all The next mowing , while she was dropping the card in teh mailbox near teh office , she was suddenly struck by the fact that Eleanor had  | once worked in an office . She had put her son through college on a high-school secretary 's salary  --  no small feat , as Delia could now appreciate . She wished she had thought to mention her job in her thank-you note . But maybe Eliza had said something . " Delia 's employed by a lawyer , " Eliza might have said . " She handles every detail for him . You should see her all dressed up for work ; if you met her on the street , you would n't know her . " " Is that so ? " Sam would ask . ( Somehow , the listener had changed from Eleanor to Sam . ) " Handles everything , you say . Not mislaying important files ? Not lounging around the waiting room , reading trashy novels ? " Well , she 'd spent more than half her life trying to win Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break a habit like that overnight . October came , and the weather grew cooler . The square filled up with yellow leaves . Some nights , Delia had to shut her windows . She bought a flannel nightgown and two long-sleeved dresses  --  one gray pinstripe , one forest green  --  and she started keeping an eye out for a good secondhand coat . It was not yet cold enough for a coat , but she wanted to be prepared . On rainy days , now , she ate lunch at the Cue Stick ' n ' Cola on Bay treet . She ordered coffee and a sandwich and watched the action at the one pool table . Vanessa often wheeled her stroller in to join her . While Greggie lurched among the chair legs like a brightly colored top , Vanessa would offer Delia thumbnail sketches of the players . " See the guy breaking ? Buck Baxter . Moved here eight or ten years ago . Baxter as in Baxter janitorial Supplies , but they say his father 's disowned him . No , Greggie , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , " she said . She meant the diminutive , dark-haired young woman who was leaning across the pool table to shoot on tiptoe , her purple canvas pocketbook still slung over her shoulder . " Must be from outside . Leave him alone , Greggie . And the fellow in the cowboy boots , that 's Belle 's ex-boyfriend , Norton Grove . Belle was out of her mind to fall for hint . Fickle ? That man put fickle iii the dictionary . " Delia was gathering an impression of Bay Borough as a town of misfits . Almost everybody here had run away from someplace else , or been run away from . And no longer did it seem so idyllic . Rick and Teensy Rackley were treated very coolly by some of the older citizens ; the only two gay  | men she knew of seemed to walk about with no one but each other ; there was talk of serious drug use in the consolidated high school ; and Mr. Pomfret 's appointment book was crammed with people feuding over property lines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had her comfortable routine , her niche in the general scheme of things . Making her way from office to library , from library to cafe , she thought that her exterior self was instructing her interior self , much like someone closing his eyes and mimicking sleep in order to persuade sleep to come . It was not that her sadness had left her , but she seemed to operate on a smooth surface several inches above the sadness . She deposited her check each Saturday ; she dined each Sunday at the Bay Arms Restaurant . People nodded now when they saw her , which she took not just for greeting but for confirmation : Ah , yes , there 's Miss Grinstead , exactly where she belongs . Although every so often something would stab her . A song from Ranisay 's Deadhead period about knock-knock-knocking on heaven 's door , for instance . Or a mother and a little girl hugging each other in front of the house across the street . " She 's leaving me ! " the mother called mock-plaintively to Delia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Maybe Delia could pretend to herself that she was back in the days before her marriage . That she did n't miss her children at all because they had n't been born yet . But in retrospect it seemed she had missed them even then . Was it possible there had been a time when she had n't known her children ? Dear Delia , Eleanor wrote . ( She addressed her letter to 14 George Street this time . ) I was so pleased to get your postcard . It 's good to know that my little gift came in handy , and I 'm glad you 're doing some reading . I myself find it impossible to sleep if I do n't read at least a few pages first , preferably from something instructive like biography or current events . For a while after Sam 's father died I used to read the dictionary . It was the only thing with small enough divisions to fit my attention span . Also the information was so definite . Probably Sam has been marked by losing his father at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my last note but I do n't believe  | ) I did . And his father never had a strong personality . Ile was the kind of man who let all the bathwater drain away before he got out of the tub . Maybe it would worry a boy to think he might grow up to do the same . I hope I have n't overstepped . Love , Eleanor Delia did n't know what to make of that . She understood it better when the next note came , some two weeks later . Please forgive me if you felt I sounded " mother-in-lawish " and that 's why you did n't answer my letter . I had no intention of offering excuses for my son . I 've always said he was forty years old when he was born , and I realize that 's not easy to live with . Delia bought another postcard  --  this one the kind with a picture on it , a rectangle of unblemished white captioned Bay Day in Bay Borough , so there was even less space to write on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of Sam , so much . I 'm here because Then she sat back , not knowing how to end the sentence . She considered starting over , but these postcards cost money , and so she settled , finally , for I 'm here because I just like the thought of beginning again nn scratch . She signed it , Love , Delia , and mailed it the following orning on her way to work . And after all , was n't that the true reason ? Truer than she had realized when she wrote it , in fact . Her leaving had very little to do with any specific person . Unlocking the office door , she noticed the pleasure she took in the emptiness of the room . She raised the white window shades ; she turned the calendar to a fresh page ; she sat down and rolled a clean sheet of paper into the typewriter . It was possible to review her entire morning thus far and find not a single misstep . Mr. Pomfret sometimes employed a detective named Pete Murphy . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a babyfaced fat boy from Eastton . It seemed he was hired less often to locate people than to /ad to locate them . Whenever a will or a title search required his services , Pete would plod in , whistling tunelessly , and trill his pudgy fingers at Delia and proceed to the inner office . He never spoke to her , and he , probably did n't know her name .  | One rainy afternoon , though , he arrived with something bulging and struggling inside the front of his windbreaker . " Got a present for you , " he told Delia . " For me ? " " Found it out in the street . " He lowered his zipper , and a small , damp gray-and-black cat bounded to the floor and made a dash for the radiator . " Oh ! " Delia said . Pete said , " Shoot . Come out of there , you little dickens . " Beneath the radiator , silence . " It 'll never come if you order it to , " Delia said . " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pretend you 're not looking . " " Well , I 'll let you see to that , " Pete decided . He brushed cat hairs off his sleeves and started for the office . " Mc ! But . . . wait ! I ca n't do this ! " Delia said . She was speaking now to Mr. Pomfret ; he had come to his door to see what all the fuss was about . " I lc 's brought a stray cat ! I ca n't take care of a cat ! " " Now , now , I 'm sure you 'll think of something , " Mr. Pomfret said genially . " Miss Grinstead was a cat in her last incarnation , you know , " he told Pete . " Is that a fact , " Pete said . They walked into the office , and Mr. Pomfret closed the door . For the next half hour , Delia worked with one eye on the radiator . She watched a gray-and-black tiger tail unfurl from behind a pipe , gradually fluffing as it dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Pete reemerged , she said , " Maybe the cat belongs to someone . Have von thought of that ? " " I dot ibt it , " he told her . " I did n't see no collar . " He trilled his fingers and left . When the door slammed behind him , the tail gave a twitch . I ) elia rose and went to the office . " Excuse me , " she said . Mr. Pomfret said , " Hmm ? " He was back at his computer already . This morning he had discovered something called Search-and-Replace that was apparently very exciting . Tap-tap , his fingers went , while he craned his sloping neck earnestly toward the screen . " Mr. Pomfret , that cat is still under the radiator and 1 ca n't take it anywhere ! I do n't even have a car ! " " Maybe get a box from the supply closet , " he said . " Daum ! " He hit several keys in succession . " Just see to it , will you , Miss Grinstead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live in a boardinghouse ! " Delia said .  | Mr. Pomfret reached for his computer manual and started thumbing through it . " Who wrote this damn thing , anyhow ? " he asked . " No human being , that 's for sure . Look , Miss Grinstead , why do n't you leave early and take the kitty wherever you think best . I 'll lock up for you , how 's that ? " Delia sighed and headed for the supply closet . Pet Heaven : they might help . She emptied a carton of manila envelopes and carried it to the other room . Kneeling in front of the radiator , she placed a palm on the floor . " Tsk-tsk ! " she said . She waited . After a minute , she felt a tiny wince of cold on the back of her middle finger . " Tsk-tsk-tsk ! " The cat peered out at her , only its whiskers and heartshaped nose visible . Gently , Delia curved her hand around the frail body and drew it forward . This was hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male with large feet and spindly legs . His fur was almost startlingly soft . It reminded her of milkweed . When she stroked him , he shrank beneath her hand , but he seemed to realize he had nowhere to run . She gathered him up and set him in the carton and folded the flaps shut . He gave a single woebegone mew before falling silent . It was still raining , and she did n't have a free hand to open het mbrella , so she hurried along the sidewalk unprotected . The carton ? ked in her arms as if it contained a bowling ball . For such a little ing , he certainly was heavy . She rounded the corner and burst through the door of Pet I leaven . A gray-haired woman stood behind the counter , checking off a list . " You would n't happen to know if Bay Borough has an S.P.C.A. , " Delia said . The woman looked at her a moment , slowly refocusing vague blue eyes . Then she said , " No ; the nearest one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes homeless animals ? " " Sorry . " " Maybe you 'd like a cat . " " Gracious ! If I brought home another stray my husband would kill me . " So Delia gave up , for now , and bought a box of kibble and a sack of litter-box filler , the smallest size of each just to get her through one night . Then she lugged the at home . Belle was their ahead of her , talking on the phone in the kitchen . Delia heard her laugh tike tiptoed up the stairs , unlocked the door of her room , set the carton on the floor , and shut the door behind her . In  | the mirror she looked like a crazy woman . Tendrils of wet hair were plastered to her forehead . The shoulders of her sweater were dark with rain , and her handbag was spotted and streaked . She bent over the carton and raised the Baps . Inside , the cat sat hunched in a snail shape , glaring up at her . Delia retreated , settled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . Eventually , the cat sprang out of the carton . Ile started sniffing around the baseboards . Delia stayed where she was . He ducked beneath the bureau and returned with linty whiskers . He approached the bed obliquely , gazing elsewhere . Delia turned her head away . A moment latest-she felt the delicate denting of the mattress as he landed on it . He passed h ( hind her , lightly brushing the length of his body against her back as if by chance . Delia did n't move a muscle . She felt they were performing a dance together , something courtly and elaborate and dignified . But she could n't possibly keep him . Then Belle 's clacky shoes started climbing the stairs . Belle almost never came upstairs . But she did today . Delia threw a glance at the cat , willing hi ' to . bide . All he did was freeze and direct a wide-eyed stare toward the or . Knock-knock . He was smack in the center of the pillow , with his bottle-brush tail standing vertical . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + a beneath his hot little downy armpits . She could feel the rapid patter of his . h rt . " Just a minute , " she called . She reached for the carton . But Belle must have misheard , for she breezed on in , caroling , " Delia , here 's a- - Then she breezed on in , caroling . Delia straightened . " I 'm just trying to find a home for him , " she said . " Aww .. What a honey ! " , , " IDo n't worry , I 'm not keeping him . " " Ohi , why not ? Er , that is ... he is housebroken , is n't he ? " All cats are housebroken , " Delia said . " For goodness ' sake ! " " Well , then ! Not keep this little socky-paws ? This dinky little pook-tuns ? " Belle was bending over the cat now and offering him her polished fingernails to sniff . " Is it a prinky-nose , " she crooned . " Is it a frowzyhead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective found hint out in the rain , " Delia said . " He just dumped him on me , nothing I could do . I mean , I knew I could n't keep him myself . Where would I put a litter box , for one thing ' "  | " In the bathroom ? " Belle asked . She started scratching behind the cat 's ears . " But how would he get out to use it ? " " You could leave your door cracked open , let him go in and out as Ile likes , " Belle said . " Ooh , feel how soft ! I do n't know why you ever lock it , anyhow . Little town like this , who do you think 's going to rob you ? Who 's going to creep in and ravish you ? " " Well ... " " Believe me , Mr. Lamb could n't gather up the enthusiasm . " Belle stroked beneath t ) ? cat 's chin , and the cat tipped his head back blissfully . He had one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know if I want my life to get that complicated , " Delia said . " Is he a complication . Is he a bundle of trouble . " Belle was holding an envelope in her free hand , Delia saw . That must be what had brought her upstairs . Eleanor 's stalky print marched across the front . Delia felt suddenly overburdened . Things were crowding iii on her so ! But when Belle said , " Are you going to keep this itty-blitty- or am I ? " Delia said , " I am , I guess . " " Well , good . Let 's call him Puffball , what do you sav ? " " Hmm , " Delia said , pretending to consider i t But she had never approved of cutesy name ' tor cats . And besides , it seemed that at some point she had already start . , thinking of him as George . She was in bed that night before she got dlv. - ii ( ' , reading Eleanor 's letter . It was more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's last postcard , news of her Meals on Wheels work . I can certainly empathize with your desire to start over ! she wrote . ( That careful word , empathize , revealing her effort to say just the right thing . ) And I 'm relieved it 's the reason you left . I had assumed it was Sam . I 've wondered if maybe he expressly wanted a flighty wife , in which case you could hardly be held to blame . But when you 've finished starting over , do you picture working up to the present again and coming home ? Just asking . All my love , dear , Eleanor  | A furry paw reached out to bat the page , and Delia laid the letter aside . The cat had found a resting place next to her on the blankets . He had eaten an enormous meal and paid two visits to the makeshift litter box in the bathroom . She could tell he was beginning to feel at home . She reached for her hook  --  Carson McCulles  --  and turned to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories and started a third . Then she found she was growing sleepy ; so she set the book on the windowsill and clicked off her little reader 's light and placed it on top of the hook . Light continued to shine through the partly open door , wilding a rod of yellow across the floorboards . She slid downward in bed very cautiously so as not to disturb the cat . He was giving himself a bath now . He pressed against her ribs with each movement in a way that seemed accidental , but she could tell he meant to do it . How strange it was , when you thought about it , that animals would share quarters with humans ! If Delia had been out in the wilderness , if this were some woodland creature nestling so close , she would have been astounded . She yawned and shut her eyes and pulled the blanket up around her shoulders . One of the stories she had read tonight was called " A Tree , a Rock , a Cloud . " A man in this story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked up to another person . Begin with something less complex , he proposed . Like a tree . Or a rock . Or a cloud . The rhythm of these words kept tapping across Delia 's mind : tree , rock , cloud First a tune ? : done , then a casual acquaintance or two , then a small , undemanding animal . Delia wondered what came after that , and where it would end up . L  | The Sunday before Thanksgiving , Belle waylaid Delia at the bottom of the stairs . " Say , Dee , " she said . " What 're you doing for the holiday ? " " Oh , urn ... " " Want to have dinner at my place ? " " Well , I 'd love to , " Delia said . " I 'm serving this real hokey meal : turkey and dressing , cranberry relish ... " I did n't know you cooked ! " " I do n't , " Belle said grimly . " It 's a plot . I 'm trying to look domestic for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , she looked anything but domestic . Sunday was always a busy day at the real estate office , and she was dressed to go out in her huge purple coat , the one with the shoulders not just padded but flaring to sharp points like an alien 's space suit . Lilac trousers swam beneath it , and the smell of her fruity , overripe perfume freighted the air all around her . " Vanessa is coming with Greggie , " she said . " Nice touch to invite a child , do n't you think ? And these out-of-towners I just sold a house to , Married couple ; that was always good .... " . " And I would help in the food department , " Delia guessed .  | " Oh , I 'm bringing in the food from outside , just between you and me . But I was thinking you could add a little , call it , class . I need for this guy to see me as all proper and respectable . And also you could advise ode on the wifely touches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to do that stuff back home , did n't you ? Do you have one of those baskety things that look like a cornucopia ? " " Well , not right handy , " Delia said . " But I 'll be glad to do what I can " Great , " Belle said . She toed the cat aside  --  he had followed Delia downstairs  --  and opened the front door . They stepped out into a chilly , tin-colored day . " This fella 's name is Henry Mcllwain , did I mention that ? " she asked . " We 've been dating several weeks now and I 'd like to start getting more purposeful . I do n't want him thinking I 'm just a goodtime gal ! Maybe you could drop a few remarks in front of him . Something like , ' Gosh , Belle , I hope you made your famous brussels-sprout dish . ' " " You 're serving him brussels sprouts ? " " I do n't have any choice . It 's the only green vegetable Copp Catering offers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How did you manage the meals when you were living with Norton ? " " We ate out . But this time I want to do things differently . Maybe while Henry 's listening you could ask me for one of my recipes . " " I can hardly wait to hear how you 'll answer , " Delia said . " Dinner 's at one , but could you come down a bit early to help set up ? And wear your was . pinstripe . Your gray pinstripe is so . . . gray ; know what I mean ? " On Thanksgiving Day Delia slept late , and she idled the morning away chinking tea and reading in bed , with the cat curled up beside her . Across the hall , in Mr. Lamb 's room , an announcer 's voice droned steadily . This was a TV announcer , Delia had figured out ; not radio . Now that she kept her door cracked open , she could hear how the music swelled and diminished without apparent reason , responding to some visual cue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged for more tea water . " The mother bear leads her cubs ... " she heard , and , " The female spider inlet h het victims . " Evidently Mr. Lamb was watching nature shows . Shortly after nook , she rose and started dressing . It was a pity she  | did n't have a string of pearls to add a festive note , she thought . ( ) r at least a scarf . Did n't she own a paisley scarf with gray commas around the edges ? Yes , she did  --  back in Baltimore . She could see it lying folded in her grandmother 's lacquer glove box . She applied an extra-bright coat of lipstick , and then she leaned toward the mirror to smooth her hair . It was longer now , which made her curls look flatter and somehow calmer  --  very suitable for Miss Grinstead . Although when she stepped back to gauge the total effect , the person who came to mind was not Miss Grinstead at all . It was Rosemary Bly-Brice . She turned sharply from the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought the day before . The cat came along when she left . He scampered after her clown the stairs , and he tumbled around her ankles while she knocked at the livingroom door . When nobody answered she tried the other door , the one to the right , and finally she turned the knob and poked her head into the dining room . " Anybody home ? " she asked . Goodness , Belle did need her services . The table  --  one of those long , narrow , wood-grain affairs you see at PTA bazaars  --  was not even spread with a cloth yet . Delia put her flowers down and walked on into the kitchen . " Belle ? " she said . Belle was leaning against the sink . Her arms were clamped across the bosom of a violently frilled white apron , and tears were streaming down her face . " Belle ? What 's happened ? " Delia asked . " He 's not coming , " Belle said thickly . " Your date ? " " He 's back with his wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , he does . " " Oh , I 'm sorry . " In fact , she was shocked , but she tried not to show it . No wonder Belle had been so eager to look respectable ! Delia gave her a tentative pat , just in case she wanted consoling . She did , it turned out . She fell into Delia 's arms , sobbing hotly against her neck . " He was perfect for me ! " she wailed . " He was exactly what I wanted ! And then this morning he calls tip and  --  oh , I should have known from how low lie was speaking , mumbling low secretive voice like he was scared somebody might hear him ? " She drew back from Delia 's embrace to snap a paper towel off the  | roll above the sink . Blotting first one eye and then the other , she said , " Belle , ' he tells me , about today . Something 's come up , ' he tells me . Oh ? ' I ask . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start the car , or wanted to bring a friend . ' Well , it 's like this , ' he tells me . Seems like Pansy and I have gotten hack together . ' " " Pansy would be his wife , " Delia guessed . " Yes , and the baby 's name is Daffodil , can you believe it ? " " ' There 's a baby ? " " . Bid it was n't even a springtime baby ! It was born in October ! " " You 're talking about ... this past October ? " Belle nodded , loudly blowing her nose . " So the baby is , what , a month old ? " " Six weeks . " " Ah . " Belle 's apron was so new that the pinholes still showed from the packaging . Her hairdo was even larger than usual , and she wore the first actual dress Delia had ever seen her in  --  or presumably it was a dress , for her legs were visible beneath the apron , encased in nylon stockings with a frosty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was a disaster  --  blurred lipstick and blackened eyes and gray dribbles of tears . " You 'll have to get in touch with the others , " she was saying as she dabbed the tears . " I ca n't possibly go through with dinner . " " But everything 's all ready , " Delia said . She was taking stock of the foil-wrapped , disposable IS covering one counter , and the plates and silver heaped on the kite hen table , and the empty serving dishes waiting to be filled . Through the oven 's lighted window she could make out a blown trukey , although she was n't able to smell it , for some reason . ? Mat ' inky looks about done , " she told Belle . " It moved done . I 'm just reheating it . I had to keep it in the fridge overnight . " " So , why not go ahead with your party ? Maybe it 'll cheer you up . " " Nothing could cheer me up , " Belle said . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . " " I wish I was dead and buried , " Belle said , pulling out one of the kitchen chairs . She sank into it and picked up the cat . " I 'm getting too old to be jilted ! I 'm thirty-eight years old . It 's tiring to keep going on first dates . " Delia did n't answer , because she was hunting a tablecloth . No telling  | where Belle kept her linens . This was one of those fifties kitchens with shiny bare walls and enormous white appliances and rust-specked white metal cabinets and drawers . She slid open every drawer with a clanking sound . Most were empty . Eventually she located a jumble of fabrics in the space below the sink . " Aha ! " she said , shaking out a wrinkled damask cloth . She carried it into the dining room and spread it over the table , resettling her flowers in the center . " I know you must have candlesticks , " she called . " We met last spring , " Belle said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were moving to a bigger place on account of the baby coming . And would n't you know it took me six months , with the market the way it 's been . " Delia opened all the drawers of the apple-green bureau that served as a dining room buffet . She found two brass candlesticks lying in a nest of extension cords , and she placed them on either side of the flowers . Meanwhile , in the kitchen , Belle had sold the house just as Daffodil arrived . " Settlement date was two days before due date , " she said . " Kid was born three days later . So naturally I stopped by the hospital with a giftie ; these things are tax-deductible . And there was Henry all proud and fatherly , took me down the hall to that baby window they have and showed me how smart and cute and blah-blah-blah . Well , he just got to me , you know ? I stood there not hearing a word he said , watching bow his mouth moved , and all at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss him , what do you guess he 'd do ? " " Candles ? " Delia asked . " Try the broom cupboard . " Belle blew her nose with a honking sound at caused the cat to spring off her lap . " And this was not even my usual style of man , " she said . " He was skinny ! And pale ! And computerish ! Rust there I stood , thinking , Suppose I unbuttoned my blouse right here in front of the baby window , staring at his mouth the whole time and running the tip of my tongue across my lower lip . " The candles were not in the broom cupboard but on top of the the refrigerator , ii and also a hit Then she coll . them out . Be cranky quarrel plotted , I lay i a yellowing white box . Even the candles were yellowed , warped , but Delia fitted them into the holders anyway . Then she collected the dishes and silver from the kitchen table and dealt e proceeded through the baby 's colic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy . " I schemed and t wait , " she said . " 1 told him my door was always open .   Two , three , four o'clock in the morning he would leave that spit-up milk and dirty-diaper smell and find me here in lily spaghetti-strap nightie from Victoria 's Secret . " And to think all this had been going on while Delia was sound asleep ! She checked the turkey . It appeared to have caved in around the breastbone . She found the brussels sprouts in their foil pan and set them in the toaster oven at 350 degrees . There were biscuits too , but she would wait to warm those till the very last minute . a weeks ago , Pansy goes back to her mom 's , " Belle said . " Takes Daffodil and leaves . I was in heaven . Did n't you notice I 've had this radiant glow about me lately ? Oh , Delia , how can you stand it , going without a love life ? " Holding a pack of paper napkins printed all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , " she said , " I do miss hugs , I guess . But nowadays when I think about , urn , the rest of it , I just feel sort of perplexed . I think , Why did that seem like such a big deal , once upon a time ? But I suppose it 's only ? " The doorbell rang . " Oh , Lord , we did n't call off dinner , " Belle said , as if she had not been sitting in the midst of Delia 's preparations . " Shoot ! I ca n't cope with this ! See who 's there , will you , while I try to fix my face . " As Delia walked through the dining room to the hall , she felt drab and thin and virginal , like somebody 's spinster aunt fulfilling her duties . It was Vanessa at the door . She wore a leather blazer and blue jeans , and she toted Greggie on her hip . Behind her , just stepping out of their car , were a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple Delia barely had time to whisper the news to Vanessa ? " Henry Mellwain 's gone back to his wife " ? before the couple arrived on the pin h " Why ! What have we here ! " the husband told Greggie . He was young , no more than thirty , but as staid as a middle-aged man , Delia thought , with his receding tuft of black hair and his long black formal overcoat . His wife was a trim , attractive brunette in a tidy red woolen shit that reminded Delia of a Barbie-doll outfit . " I 'm Delia Grinstead , " Delia told her . " This is Vanessa Linley  --  do you know , each other ? ? and Greggie . " " We 're the Hawsers , " the husband said for both of hem . " Donald and Melinda . " " Wo n't you conk in ? " She planned to lead them into the living room , but when she turned  | she found Belle at the door of the dining room . She was showing all her teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . " Happy Thanksgiving ! " she sang out . Whatever repairs she had made to her face had not done much good . Gray tracks still ran down her cheeks , and her eyes were pink and puffy . But she caroled , " So glad you could come ! Step in and have a seat ! " There was nowhere to sit but around the table . " Donald , you 're on my right , " Belle said , " and Vanessa 's on my left . I 've put Greggie next to you , Vanessa . Get some phone books from the kitchen if he needs a booster . And Melinda 's on the other side of Greggie . " Well , maybe this was the local custom : proceeding directly to the food . But even Vanessa seemed taken aback . And the husband ( still wearing his overcoat ) stood frozen in place for a moment before approaching his chair . " Are we . . . late ? " he asked Belle . " Late ! Not at all ! " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Delia , you 'll sit next to ? " She broke off . " Oh ! " she cried . " Delia ! Honestly ! " " What 's the matter ? " Delia asked . " You 've gone and laid too many places ! " It was true . Delia had doled out all she 'd found on the kitchen table , and that must have included a setting for Henry MeIlwain . Belle gazed toward the chair at the far end , her eyes brimming over with fresh tears . " I 'm sorry , " Delia told her . " We could just ? " " Run fetch Mr. Lamb , " Belle ordered . " Mr. Lamb ? From upstairs ? " " Hurry , though . We 're all waiting . Tell him we 'll eat without him if he does n't get down here pronto . " What they would have eaten Delia could n't imagine , since there was n't a morsel of food anywhere in sight . But Vanessa , returning from the kitchen with several phone books , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal on . " Delia went out to the hall , which seemed very quiet after the bustle in the dining room . With the cat twining underfoot , she climbed the stairs and knocked on Mr. Lamb 's door . " Desperately , the salmon fling themselves against the current , " a stern voice announced . The door opened on a sliver of Mr. Lamb 's rag-and-bone face . " Yes ? " he said , and then , " Oh ! " for George had somehow managed to wriggle through the crack . Delia said , " Belle sent me up to invite you for Thanksgiving dinner . "  | " But it seems your animal 's got into my room ! " " Sorry , " Delia said . " Here , George . " She reached in for the cat , and Mr. Lamb grudgingly opened the door another few inches . Delia caught the hazelnut smell of clothes worn once and then stuffed into drawers unwashed . The television 's icy light flickered the dimness . She scooped George up and backed away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom sink , " Mr. Lamb told her . " The . . . ? " " Could n't your animal use the outdoors ? " " Not in the middle of the night , " Delia said . She clutched George more tightly and asked , " Are you coming to dinner , or are n't you ? " " What time ? " " Urn . . . now ? " " Well , I suppose I could make it , " Mr. Lamb said . He looked down at what he was wearing  --  a limp T-shirt , baggy dark pants  --  and then sadly closed the door in her face . Delia wondered how a man so fond of nature programs could object to a harmless cat . Downstairs , Vanessa had finished setting everything on the table ? turkey , brussels sprouts , cranberry relish , mashed sweet potatoes dotted with marshmallows , all in their original pans . Still wearing her leather blazer , she was spooning the stuffing out of the turkey . Greggie lolled on the stack of plume hooks , sucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must be naptime . Belle was discussing Henry with the Hawsers . " What I ca n't figure , " she was saving , " is when all this came about . Last night as of ten o'clock , everything was jim-dandy . Henry and I had a real nice dinner over in ( ) ( ( . m ( : cty . Then this noon on the phone  --  poof ! He 's a totally changed man " " So his wife showed up in the morning , " Donald Hawser said sagely . Ile had draped his coat over the back of his chair , and he was lighting the warped candles with a silver lighter . " She got out of bed this morning and , ' Here I am , ' she must have said , ' away from home on Thanksgiving . A family holiday , ' she said . " Delia placed the cat on the floor and sat down next to Donald . A family holiday , she thought , and I 'm eating a store-cooked turkey with strangers . She felt madcap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom when I ought to be with my husband , ' she said , and she packed her suitcase then and there and went back to him , but he could n't let you know till noon because what was he going to do  --  excuse himself and run phone you the minute she walked in ? " " Donald has an expert opinion to offer on every subject , " his wife announced with a brittle laugh . She was sitting very tensely , her spine not touching the chair . Her hair was scrolled upward at the ends like the sound holes in a violin . " Yes ; you might call it a gift , " Donald agreed , unruffled . " I 'm able to envision . See , first there 's the business of settling her into the house . Do n't forget she has that baby with her , and a diaper bag no doubt and one of those infant car seats ? " " But he could have just turned her away ! " Belle exploded . " He does n't even love her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , of course that 's what he would claim , " Donald said , leaning back expansively . By now Vanessa was carving the turkey . Delia began passing around the other foods . The brussels sprouts were barely warm , she discovered . The sweet potatoes were refrigerator cold , but everybody took some anyhow . " You 're right , " Belle said . " Oh , when will I learn ? Seems this happens to me about every other week . Norton Grove was the only one who actually divorced his wife for me , and look how that ended up ! " " How did it end up ? " Delia asked . " He fell in love with a lady plumber who came to unstop our sink . " Donald nodded , implying he could have predicted as much . " It 's just the way Ann Landers keeps saying in her column , " Belle told them . " She says a man who would leave his wife will most likely leave you , too , by and by . " " Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , " Vanessa suggested , handing her son a turkey wing . " Yes , but it 's kind of like I lack imagination . I mean , I ca n't seem to picture marrying a man till I see him married to someone else . Then I say , Why ! He 'd make a good husband for me ! ' " The hallway door opened and Mr. Lamb stood on the threshold , wearing a shiny black suit that turned his skin to ashes . " Oh , God , you have guests , " he said . " Yes , Mr. Iamb , and you 're one of them , " Belle said . " Donald  | Hawser , Melinda Hawser . . . Vanessa and Greggie you 've seen around , I bet . This is Horace Lamb , " she told the others . She waved carelessly toward the one empty chair . " Have a seat . " " Well , I ca n't stay long . " " I lave a seat , Mr. Lamb . " I le entered the room with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet he wore the kind of backless paper slippers given out free in hospitals . " This afternoon will be sports , sports , sports , " he said as lie fell into his chair . " All regular programs are preempted . I 'm reduced to the educational channels . " " Say ! " Donald cried . " Who you going to root for ? " " Pardon ? Weekday afternoons , I like to watch the soaps . Oh , I confess . I admit it . I make a point of stopping for All My Children every blessed day I 'm on the road . " " What 's your line of business , Horace ? Okay if I call you Horace ? " " I sell storm windows , " Mr. Lamb told him . He accepted the container of sweet potatoes and peered down into it . " This looks exceedingly rich , " he said . His long front teeth were so prominent that his lips had to labor to stretch across them . His whole face seemed stretched , and too intricately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Belle and said , " Regrettably , I 'm afflicted with a touchy stomach . " " Oh , eat up , it 'll do you good , " Belle snapped . " We were discussing married men . " " Pardon ? " " Another problem I have is , I look at a married man and I ca n't believe he wo n't find me irresistible . " " Ii resistible ? " " I 'm speaking to the table at large , Mr. Lamb . Eat your dinner . I see a man with his wife , mousy boring wife who is n't even attempting to keep herself up , and I think , Why would n't he prefer me instead ? I 'm a hell of a lot more fun , and better-looking to boot . But it 's like there 's some  --  I do n't know  --  some hold wives have , and I ca n't seem to break it . Is it a secret ? Is it some secret you-all pass around among yourselves ? " She was asking Melinda Hawser , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of biscuit onto her plate . " Is it ? " Belle asked Delia . " Oh , no , " Delia told her . " It 's more like just ... what 's the word The word from science class . Momentum ? " " Inertia , " Mr. Lamb supplied .  | " Right . " She glanced over at him . " It 's just a matter of people staying where they are . " " Well , if that 's all it is , " Belle said , " how come Katie O'Connell got to waltz off to Hawaii with Larry Watts ? She must have found out the secret . Why , when Larry Watts was boarding here , he never even gave inc a look ! He almost seemed to be avoiding me . He acted like I was some floozy the one time I asked him downstairs for a friendly little drink ! " Her mouth collapsed , and she covered her eyes with one hand . Donald said , " Oh , now ! Hey ! " and Vanessa said , " Aw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamb started tugging ferociously at his nose . " To be honest , " Melinda said in a crystal voice , " I ca n't think what you want with a husband anyhow . " There was a pause , a kind of reconsidering among the other diners . " Who first thought marriage up , do you suppose ? " Melinda asked Greggie . He goggled at her from behind a greasy fistful of turkey wing . " Everyone pushes it so , especially the women . Your mother and your aunts and your girlfriends . Then after you 're married you see how he 's always so full of himself and always going on about something , always got these theories and pronouncements , always crowing over these triumphs at his business . ' I told them this , ' and ' I told them that , ' and you ask , ' What did they say back ? ' and he says , ' Oh , you know , but then I told them such and such , and I let them have it outright , I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And if you mention this to your mother and your aunts and so forth , ' Oh , ' they say , ' marriage is a pain , all right . ' ' Well , if that 's the way you feel , ' you want to ask them , ' why did n't you speak up before ? Where were you when I was announcing my en-gagement ? ' " " Ha . Yes , " her husband said . He glanced around the table . " They 're going to think you mean our marriage . Dear . " Everybody waited , but Melinda just speared a brussels sprout . " Oh , " Belle assured him , " we would never think that . " She was sitting erect now , her tears already drying on her cheeks . " A gorgeous man like you ? Of course we would n't . " She told the others , " Donald and Melinda are customers of mine . They bought the old Meers place  --  lovely place . Donald 's an important executive at the furniture plant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or maybe it only seemed that way because the room was so quiet . " Mrs. Meers had gone into the nursing home , " Belle said , " hut Mr.  | Meers was still living there . Took us through the house himself ; taught us how to work the trash compactor . Told us , ' Here in the freezer are one hundred forty-four egg whites , no charge . ' " " Folks who made their own mayonnaise , " Mr. Lamb surmised . Belle was about to go on speaking , but she stopped and looked at him . " I do n't guess you 'd be in the market for storm windows , " Mr. Lamb told Donald . " Not really , " Donald said , with his eyes on his wife . " All , well , I did n't think so . " ' That house needs absolutely nothing , " Belle said . " The Meerses kept after it every minute . And Donald here , Don . . . " She smiled at him . " Don spotted that the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a fine marriage . Married seven years , " Donald said , still watching his wife . " We were one of those recognized campus couples at our college . Went steady , got pinned : the works . " " I know the type you mean , " Belle said . " Why , Melinda 's known me so long she still calls me Hawk ! Hawk Hawser , " he added , turning at last to meet Belle 's gaze . " I was on the basketball team . Kind of a star , some people might say , though I never had the height to go professional . " " Is that right ! " Belle exclaimed . " Ilawk I lawyer , " he repeated lingeringly . " I believe I might 've heard of you . " " Well , maybe if you were ever in Illinois . Jerry Bingle College ? " " Jerry Bincle College . " " I played center . " " And midway through my senior year ? " " Marshmallow , " Greggie demanded . He did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spoke very precisely and daintily . " Mama ? Marshmallow ! " It was Delia , finally , who plucked a marshmallow from the sweet potatoes and reached across the table to set it on his plate . Everyone else was watching Belle . Open-mouthed and breathless , miraculously recovered , Belle stroked her topmost button with a hypnotic , circular motion and kept her damp-lashed eyes focused raptly on Donald 's lips .  | Sometimes Mr. Pomfret ordered Delia to go out and feed the parking meter for a client . Sometimes he snapped his fingers when he needed her . Once , he tossed her his raincoat and told her to take it down the block to the one-hour cleaner 's . " Yes , Mr. Pomfret , " she murmured . When she returned , she placed the receipt on his palm as smartly as a surgical nurse dealing out a scalpel . But now she began to feel a little itch of rebellion . " Miss Grinstead , ca n't you see I 'm merging ? " he demanded when she brought in some letters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pomfret , " but neutrally , too evenly , with her expression set in granite . And back at her desk , she seethed with imaginary retorts . You and your crummy computer ! You and your " merging " and your Search-and-Destroy or what-ever ! One Friday in early December , a stooped , gray-haired man in a baseball jacket arrived without an appointment . " I 'm Mr. Leon Wesley , " Ile told Delia . ' This is about my son Juval . Do you think Mr. Pomfret might have a minute for me ? " Mr. Pomfret 's office door was closed  --  it was early morning , his time to peruse new catalogs  --  but when Delia inquired , he said , " Leon ? Why ,  | Leon resurfaced my driveway for me . Send him in . And make us a pot of coffee while you 're at it . " It was impossible to avoid overhearing Mr. Wesley 's reason for coming . He poured it out even before he was seated , speaking through the grinding of the coffee beans so Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Wesley said , was scheduled to join the navy first thin ; after Christmas . He had a highly promising future ; special interest had been taken on account of his qualifications , which seemed to involve sonic technical know-how that Delia could n't quite follow . And last night , clear out of the blue , he had been arrested for breaking and entering . Caught climbing through the Hanffs ' dining-room window at ten o'clock in the evening . " The Hanffs ! " Mr. Pomfret said . The Hanffs owned the furniture factory , as even Delia knew  --  the town 's one industry . " Well , of all the doggone folks to up and burglarize , " he said . Delia went to the supply closet for more sugar , and when she came back Mr. Pomfret was still marveling at Juval 's choice of victims . " I mean , here you 've got Reba Hanff , who disapproves of jewelry and does n't own a piece of silver , " he said , " gives every cent of their profits to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy hope to steal , for God 's sake ? " " And why , is what I 'd like to know , " Mr. Wesley said . " That 's the part I ca n't figure . Was he in need of money ? For what ? He does n't even drink , let alone take drugs . Does n't even have a girlfriend . " " Not to mention the I huffs own the only house alarm in all of Bay Borough " Mr. Pomfret loused . And with such a hotshot career ahead ! " Mr. Wesley said . " You can het that 's all clown the drain now . How come he went and ruined things , so close to time he was leaving ? " " Mavbe that 's how come , " Delia spoke up , setting two mugs on a tray . " Ma'am ? " " Maybe he ruined things so he would n't have to leave after all . " Mr. Wesley gaped at her . Mr. Pomfret said , " You may go now , Miss Grinstead . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind you , please . " She shut the door with such conspicuous care that every part of the latch declared itself .  | In regard to the establishment of a designated fund , she typed , and then Mr. Pomfret emerged from his office , stuffing his arms into his overcoat as he walked , forging a trail for Mr. Wesley . " Cancel my ten o'clock , " he told Delia . " Yes , Mr. Pomfret . " He opened the outer door , ushered Mr. Wesley through it , and then closed it and came back to stand at Delia 's desk . " Miss Grinstead , " he said , " from now on , please do not volunteer comments during my consultations . " She stared at him stubbornly , keeping her eyes wide and innocent . " You 're paid for your secretarial skills , not for your opinions , " he said . " Yes , Mr. Pomfret . " He left . She knew she had deserved that , but still she felt a flare of righteous anger once he was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard that the typewriter kept skidding across the desk . When she called to cancel the ten o'clock appointment , her voice shook . And when she left the office at lunchtime , she picked up a Bay Borough Bugle so she could look for another job . Well , not that she would actually go through with it , of course . It was just that she needed to fantasize awhile . The weather was raw and dismal , and she had n't brought any food with her , but she walked to the square even so because she could n't deal with the Cue Stick ' n ' Cola today . She found the park benches deserted . The statue looked huddled and dense , like a bird with all its feathers reared against the cold . She wrapped her coat around her and sat down on the very edge of one damp , chilly slat . How satisfying it would be to announce her resignation ! " I regret to inform you , Mr. Pompous . . . , " she would say . He would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept the carbon paper . She opened the Bugle and searched for the classified section . As a rifle she did n't read the Bugle , which was little more than an advertising handout  --  several pages of half-price specials and extremely local news , stacked weekly in various storefronts . She flipped past a choral call for the Christmas Eve Sing on the square , a two-for-one day at the shoe store , and a progress report on the Mitten Drive . On the next-to-last page she discovered four I kip Wanted ads : baby-sitter , baby-sitter , lathe operator , and " live-in woman . " This town must have unemployment prob-  | lems .

Call Mr. Miller at Underwood High 8 ? 5 Mon  --  Fri . Delia clucked . The nerve of the man ! Some people wanted the moon . She rattled the paper impatiently and refolded it . You ca n't expect a mere hireling to serve as a genuine mother , which was really what he was asking . She rose and placed the Bugle in the trash basket . So much for that . Crossing West Street , she glanced toward the shops  --  Debbi 's and the dime store and the florist . How about a job in sales ? No , she was too quiet-natured . As for waitressing , she used to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took to walk to the kitchen . And she knew from her talks swath Mfrs . Lincoln at the library that the town was having to smuggle to support even one librarian . Actually , she reflected , passing the sterile white blinds of the Fingernail ( : 11111 ( , a hireling would in some ways be better than a mother less emotionally ensnarled , less likely to cause damage . Certainly less likely to suffer damage herself . When the employer 's child was unhappy , it mould never occur to the live-in woman to feel personally responsible . She turned into Value Vision and took another Bugle from the stack just Inside the door . " I would n't like for my son to think people are checking him over , " Mr. Miller said " Filing through to see if he 's up to standard . That 's why I asked you to come while he was out . Then if you find you 're interested ,  | you could stay on and meet him . He 's eating supper at a friend 's , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He sat across from her in a chintz armchair that he seemed to dwarf , as he dwarfed the whole overstuffed , overdecorated living room of this little ranch house on the edge of town . To Delia 's surprise , he 'd turned out to be someone she recognized . Joel Miller : he had consulted Mr. Pomfret several months ago on a visitation matter . She remembered admiring his undisguised baldness . Men who scorned the subterfuge of artfully draped strands of hair , she felt , conveyed an attractive air of masculine assurance ; and Mr. Miller , with his large , regular features and his olive skin and loose gray suit , seemed positively serene . Underneath , though , she detected some tension . He had told her three times  --  contradicting the entire gist ' of his ad  --  that his son would be at school for the vast majority of every day , in essence all day , and that even when he was home he required not much more than a token adult in the wings . Delia had the feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He eats at friends ' houses often , in fact , " Mr. Miller was saying . " And in summer  --  I do n't think I mentioned this  --  he spends two weeks at sleep-away camp . Besides which there 's computer day camp , soccer clinic ? " " Summer ! " Delia said . She rocked back in her chintz-padded rocking chair . Summer , with its soft , lazy afternoons , tinkling glasses of lemonade , children 's peach-colored bodies in swimsuits ! " Oh , Mr. Miller , " she said . " The truth is , I seem to be in a changeable stage of life right now . I 'm not sure I could get that . . . invested . " " And in summer I 'm around more myself , " Mr. Miller went on , as if she had n't spoken . " Not the whole day , exactly  --  a principal does n't have quite the same leeway his teachers do  --  but quite a lot . " " I probably should n't have come , " Delia said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then why did you come ? he might reasonably have asked , but instead , poor man , he seized on her last sentence . " You sound experienced , " he said . " Do you have children of your own , Miss Grinstead ? Oh . " The corners of his mouth jerked briefly downward . " I 'm sorry . Of course not . " " Yes , I do , " she told him . " So it 's Mrs. Grinstead ? " " I prefer Miss . ' " " I see . " He thought this over .  | " But , so , you are experienced , " he said finally . " That 's excellent ! And do you come from this area ? " Evidently he did n't keep up with Bay Borough gossip . " No , I do n't , " she told him . " You do n't . " She could see him reconsidering . Desperate he might be , but not foolhardy . Ile would n't want to hire an ax murderer . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm perfectly respectable , I promise , but I 've put that part of my life behind me . " " Aim . " Oh , Lord , now he was envisioning some drama . He surveyed her with interest , his head slightly tilted . " But ! " she exclaimed . " As far as the job goes ? " " I know : you do n't want it , " he said sadly . " It 's nothing to do with the job itself . I 'm sure your son is a very nice boy . " Oh , he 's more than nice , " Mr. Miller said . " He 's really , he 's such a good kid , Miss Grinstead . He 's wonderful ! But I guess I overestimated how well we could do on our own . I thought as long as we knew how to work the washing machine . . . But things have gotten away from me . He waved a hand toward the room in general , which puzzled Delia , because it seemed painfully neat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirted couch , each one propped at a careful angle . Glossy fashion magazines lapped at mathematical intervals across the coffee table . But Mr. Miller , following her glance , said , " Oh , the surface I can handle . I 've posted a chart in the kitchen . Each day has its special job . This afternoon we vacuumed , yesterday we dusted . But it seems there are other issues . Last weekend , for example , he asked if we could have penny soup . ' Penny soup ! ' I said . Sounded kind of weird to me . I le said his mother used to serve it for lunch when he was little . I asked him what was in it , and it turns out he meant plain old vegetable soup . I guess they call it penny soup because it 's cheap . So I said , ' Well , I can make that . ' I heat up a tin of Campbell 's , he takes one look , and what does he do ? Starts crying . Twelve years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as whimper the time he broke his arm . I said , ' Well , what ? What did I do wrong ? ' He said it had to he homemade . I said , ' God Almighty , Noah . ' Still , I 'm not stupid . I knew this soup had sonic meaning for him . So I haul out a cookbook and set to work making  | homemade . But when he saw what I was doing , he told me to forget it . Just forget the whole thing , ' he told me . I 'm not hungry anyhow . ' And off he went to his room , leaving me with a pile of diced carrots . " " Sliced , " Delia told him . He raised his straight black eyebrows . " You should have sliced the carrots , " she told him , " and also zucchini , yellow squash , new potatoes  --  everything coin-shaped . That 's why they call it penny soup . It 's nothing to do with the cost . I doubt you 'd find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . mother 's recipe , you know ? " " Miss Grinstead , " Mr. Miller said , " let me show you where you 'd stay if you took the job . " " No , really , I ? " " Just to look at ! It 's the guest room . Has its own private bath . " She rose when he did , but only because she wanted to make her escape . What had she been thinking of , coming here ? It seemed she could feel within the curl of her fingers the urge to slice those vegetables as they ought to be sliced , to set the soup in front of the boy and turn away briskly ( twelve was too old to cuddle ) and pretend she had n't noticed his tears . " I 'm sure it 's a lovely room , " she said . " Somebody 's going to love it ! Somebody young , maybe , who still has enough ... " She was trailing Mr. Miller down a short , carpeted hall lined with open doors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her see in . It was the sort of room where people were expected to spend no more than a night or two . The high double bed allowed barely a yard of space on either side . The nightstand bore a thoughtful supply of guest-type reading ( more magazines , two books that looked like anthologies ) . The framed sampler on the wall read WELCOME in six languages . " Large walk-in closet , " Mr. Miller said . " Private bath , as I believe I 've mentioned . " In another part of the house , a door slammed and a child called , " Dad ? " " Ah , " Mr. Miller said . " Coming ! " he called . " Now you get to meet Noah , " he told Delia . She took a step backward . " Just to say hello , " he assured her . " What harm could that do ? " She had no choice but to follow him down the hall again . In the kitchen ( cabinets the color of toffees , wallpaper printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tugging off a red jacket . He had a tumble of rough brown hair and a thin , freckled face and his father 's  | long dark eyes . As soon as they entered the room , he started talking . " Hey , Dad , guess what Jack 's mother gave us for dinner ! This , like , cubes of meat that you dunk into this . . . " He registered Delia 's presence , flicked a look at her , and went on . " . . . dunk into this pot and then ? " " Noah , I 'd like you to meet Miss Grinstead , " his father said . " Should we call you Delia ? " he asked her . She nodded ; it hardly mattered . " I 'm Joel , " lie said , " and this is Noah . My son . " Noah said , " Oh . Hi . " He wore the guarded , deadpan expression that children assume for introductions . " So the pot is full of hot oil , I guess it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " his father said . " You 're talking about fondue . " " Right , and each of us got our own fork to cook our meat on , with different , like , animals on the handles so we could keep straight whose was whose . Like mine was a giraffe , and guess what Jack 's little sister 's was ? " " I ca n't imagine , " his father said . " Son , Delia is here to ? " " A pig ! " Noah squawked . " His little sister got the pig ! " " Is that right . " " And she cried about it too , but Carrie cries about everything . Then for dessert we each had a bag of chocolate marbles , but I turned mine down . I was polite about it , though . I go to his mom , I go ? " " Said . " " I lull ? " You said to his mom . " " Right , I 'm all , Thanks a lot , Mrs. Newell , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I thought you liked chocolate marbles , " his father said . " Arc you kidding ? Not after what I know now . " Noah turned to Delia . " Chocolate marbles are coated with ground-up beetle shells , " he told her . " No ! " she said . " No , " Mr. Miller agreed . " Where 'd you get that information ? " he asked his son . " Kenny Moss told me . " " Well , then ! If Kenny Moss said it , how can we doubt it ? " " I 'm serious ! He heard it from his uncle who 's in the business . " " What business  --  tabloid newspapers ? " " I lull ? "  | " There are no beetle shells in chocolate marbles . Take my word for it . The FDA would never allow it . " " And guess what 's in corn chips , " Noah told Delia . " Those yellow corn chips ? Seagull do . " " I never knew that ! " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his father said . " Honest , Dad ! Kenny Moss swears it ! " " Noah , Delia came to talk about keeping house for us . " Delia shot Mr. Miller a frown . He wore an oblivious , bland expression , as if he had no idea what he 'd done . " Actually , " she said , turning to Noah , " I was only . . . inquiring . " " She 's going to think about it , " Mr. Miller amended . Noah said , " That 'd be great ! I 've been having to fix my own school lunches . " " Horrors , " his father said . " Do n't let on to the child-labor au-thorities . " " Well , how would you feel ? You open your lunch box : Gee , I wonder what I surprised myself with today . ' " Delia laughed . She said , " I should be going . It was nice to meet you , Noah . " " Goodbye , " Noah said . Unexpectedly , he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . " His hand was small but callused . When he looked up at her , his eyes showed an underlay of gold , like sunshine filtered through brown water . Outside the front door , Delia told his father , " I thought you did n't want him to feel people were checking him over . " " Ah , " Mr. Miller said . " Yes . Well . " " I thought you were trying to spare him ! Then you went and told him what I was here for . " " I realize I should n't have done that , " Mr. Miller said . He spread one hand distractedly across his scalp , like a cap . " It 's just that I wanted so badly for you to say you 'd come . " " And you have n't seen my references , even ! You do n't know the first thing about me ! " " No , but I approve of your English . " " English ? " " It kills Inc to hear him speak so sloppily . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I go ' instead of ' I said . ' It drives me hats . "  | " Well , of all things , " Delia said . She turned to leave . " Miss Grinstead ? Delia ? " " What . " " Will you at least think it over ? " " Of course , " she said . But she knew she would n't . Vanessa said Joel Miller was the most pitiful man she knew of . " Ever since his wife left , the guy has been barely coping , " she told Delia . " Is n't anyone in Bay Borough happily married ? " Delia wondered . " Yes , lots of folks , " Vanessa said . " Just not who you choose to hang out with . " They were sitting in Vanessa 's kitchen the following morning , a cold , sunny Saturday . Really it was her grandmother 's kitchen ; Vanessa and all three of her brothers lived with their father 's mother . Vanessa was filling out labels with an old-fashioned steel-nibbed pen . Highly Effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ivory paper ovals . Highly Effective was an ancient family recipe . When Vanessa had finished her daily allotment of labels , her youngest brother would glue them onto the slender glass phials in which various dried sprigs and berries bobbed mysteriously underwater . Delia found it hard to believe that people could make a living this way , but evidently the Linleys did all right . The house was large and comfortable , and the grandmother could afford to travel once a year to Disney World . Vanessa said the trick was pennyroyal . " Do n't let this get around , " she 'd told Delia , " but insects despise pennyroyal . The other herbs are mostly for show . " On the floor , Greggie was building a tower with stacks of corks . After Vanessa finished her labels , she and Delia were going to take him to visit Santa . Then Delia might do a little Christmas shopping . Or maybe not ; she could n't decide . She had always disliked Christmas , with its possibilities for disappointing her family 's secret hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should she just , maybe , skip the whole business ? Oh , why was n't there an etiquette book for runaway wives ? Which brought her back to Mr. Miller . " How come his wife left him , does anyone know ? " she asked Vanessa . " Oh , sure ; everyone knows . Here they were , together for years , sweet little boy , nice house , and one day last spring Ellie , that 's his wife , found a lump in her breast . Went to the doctor and he said , yup , looked like  | cancer . So she came home and told her husband , In the time that I have left to me , I want to make the very best of my life . I want to do exactly what I 've dreamed of . ' And by nightfall she had packed up and gone . That was her deepest , dearest wish  --  did you ever hear such a thing ? " " So where is she now ? " " Oh , she 's a TV weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lump was nothing at all ; they removed it under local anesthetic . Now Mr. Miller and Noah can turn on their TV and watch her every evening . Or you might have seen her in Boardwalk Bulletin . They ran a profile of her last August . Real pretty blond ? Hair like that shredded straw we pack our bottles in . Course , no one here was impressed in the slightest ? person who 'd leave her own child . " Delia looked down at her lap . " All the women in town have been trying to help Mr. Miller out , " Vanessa said . " Bringing pans of lasagna , taking his kid for the afternoon . But I guess by summer he realized it was n't enough , because that 's when he put the ad in the Bugle . " " The ad 's been in since summer ? " " Right , but his neighbor tells me the onliest answers were teenaged girls from the high school . Every girl at Dorothy Underwood 's got a crush on Mr. Miller . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . I was a senior the first year he was principal , and I thought he was the sexiest man I 'd ever laid eyes on . But of course he ca n't hire some airhead , so he 's just kept running the ad . It never crossed my mind you 'd want the job yourself . " " Well , I do n't , really , " Delia said . She watched Greggie start a cork train across the linoleum . His little hands reminded her of biscuits , that kind with a row of fork holes pricked on top . She had forgotten what a joy it was to rest your eyes on young children . " It 's just that I 'm so fed yip with Mr. Pomfret , " she said . " Do you suppose they have any openings at the furniture factory ? " " Oh , the furniture factory , " Vanessa said , dipping her pen . " All 's they ever need there is oilers . Stand all day rubbing oil into chair legs with these big mittens on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Typist , filing clerk ... " " I low come you 're not taking the job at Mr. Miller 's ? " " I do n't want to just ... step into a little boy 's life like that , in case I decide to leave , " Delia told her .  | " Do you always up and leave a place ? " Delia was n't sure how that question was intended . She looked at Vanessa suspiciously . " No , not always , " she said . " I mean I never heard you speak a word against Zeke Pomfret . Now you want to quit . " " He 's so bossy , though . So condescending . Also , the pay is ridicu-lous , " Delia said . " I did n't realize how ridiculous when I took the job . And lie does n't even provide health insurance ! What if I got sick ? " Vanessa sat back to watch her . " Well , " Delia told her , " yes , I do seem to up and leave a lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight figure marching down the coastline . It was strange , the feeling of affection the image summoned up in her . For her family 's Christmas , she decided to buy nothing at all . Maybe Greggie 's trip to Santa had depressed her . He had appeared to grasp the concept before they went , but once they got there he started screaming and had to be carried out . Vanessa was crushed ; even the Santa looked crushed . And their shopping expedition afterward was spiritless , with Greggie hiccuping tearfully and slouching in his stroller in a brooding , insulted manner . Delia told Vanessa she thought she would call it a day . " I need to go to the laundromat anyhow , " she said  --  a flimsy excuse . When she got home , Belle hailed her from the living-room doorway . " You had a phone call , " she said . ' I did ' ' Her knees seemed to melt . She thought first of the children , then of Sam 's heart . lint Belle said , " Mr. Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits back . " Oh , .. " I did n't know you knew Joel Miller . " Delia had n't mentioned him to Belle because working for him would mean moving out of this house , and how could she ever do that ? This house was perfect .. Even Mr. Pomfret had his good points . Somehow the visit to Santa had shown her that . So she nonchalantly accepted the number Belle had scrawled on the corner of a takeout menu . Might as well get this over with . She perched on one arm of the couch and reached for the phone and dialed . Meanwhile Belle hovered in the background ,  | supposedly absorbed with the cat . " Is you a nice little kitty . Is you a sweet little kitty , " she crooned . Delia listened to the ringing at the other end of the line , letting her eyes travel gratefully over the blank white walls and bare floorboards . " Hello ? " Noah said . She said , " This is Delia Grinstead . " " Oh , hi ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sorry ? For what ? " " Dad says a guy should n't talk about seagull do in front of ladies . " " Oh . Well ? " A man said something in the background . " Women , " Noah said . " Excuse me ? " " Women , ' I meant to say , not ladies . ' " All pretext , of course . Mr. Miller surely did n't think she would be offended by seagull do . Or the word " ladies . " This was mere strategy . But Noah himself probably had no inkling of that , and so Delia told him , " It 's quite all right . " " Kenny Moss 's uncle drives a snack truck ; that 's how Kenny knows about the you-know-what . But Dad claims his uncle was teasing him . I ) ad goes , Right , the corn-chip factory really does take the time to send their workers out to the beach with shovels . ' " Another mutter in the background . " Okay , said . ' He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that he said " ? heavy stress , meaningful pause ? " he said how come it 's not in the list of ingredients , if they use seagull do ? Oops . " " Oh , you know those lists , " Delia told him . " All those scientific terms . They can cover up just about anything with some chemicalsounding name . " " They can ? " " Why , sure ! They probably call it dihydroxyexymexylene ' or some such . " Noah giggled . " Hey , Dad , " he said , his voice retreating slightly . " Delia says it probably is on the list ; it 's probably dihydroxy ... " Belle had carried the cat over to the window now . She was holding him up to the glass , which was nearly opaque with dust . And cobwebs clouded the tops of the curtains , and the philodendron plant on the sill was leggy and bedraggled . The whole room seemed drained of color , as if , already , it had slipped into the dimmest reaches of Delia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , eh , " without so much as a change of expression . ( You would think she was a piece of office equipment . ) All he asked , he said , was that she finish out the week  --  tie up any dangling odds and ends . Which of course she agreed to do , even though there were no odds and ends ; just the usual busywork of rat-a-tat letters and robot phone calls and Mr. Pomfret 's daily sheaf of marked catalogs . It seemed he urgently required a pair of perforated leather driving gloves . A radio antenna the size and shape of a breakfast plate . A solidwalnut display rack for souvenir golf balls . When she turned in her office key on Friday afternoon , he told her he might wait till after New Year 's to replace her . " This time , " he said , " I believe I 'll hire a word processor , assuming I can find one . " Delia was confused , for an instant . She pictured hiring a machine . Just try asking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! she thought . Then she realized her mistake . But still , somehow , she felt hurt , and she shouldered her bag abruptly and left without saying goodbye .  | 1 All she owned fit easily in a cardboard carton begged from Rick-Rack 's . The goosenecked lamp poked its head out , though . She could have left it that way ( Belle was giving her a ride ) , but she liked the notion of a life no larger than a single , compact box ; and so she shifted things until the flaps closed securely . Then she took her coat and handbag from the bed , and she picked the carton up and walked out . No point sending one last look backward . She knew every detail of that room by heart  --  every nail hole , every seam in the wallpaper , and the way the paw-footed radiator , in the furry half-light of this overcast Saturday morning , resembled some skeletal animal sitting on its haunches . At the bottom of the stairs , she set down her load and put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen . He was staying here another week or two , just till Delia was settled . It was Delia 's belief that she had to let her own smell permeate the new place first ; otherwise he 'd keep running back to the old place . Mr. Miller had told her George was more than welcome . He 'd been meaning to buy a cat anyhow , he said . ( But notice how he 'd used the word " buy , " apparently unaware that true animal lovers would not be caught dead in a pet shop . ) Still buttoning her coat , she walked through the dining room to knock on the kitchen door . " Coming , " Belle called . Delia returned to the hall . Upstairs , Mr. Lamb was creaking the floorboards , and his TV had started its level , fluent murmur . She wondered when he would get around to noticing she was gone . Maybe never , she thought . It was still not too late to change her mind . " I gave George a can of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That ought to keep him occupied . " " Oh , Belle , you 'll spoil him . " " Nothing 's too good for my whiskums ! I 'm hoping he 'll refuse to leave me when it 's time . No , no , Mommy ! ' " she squeaked . " I want to stay here with Aunt Belle ! ' " Meanwhile she was flouncing into her winged coat , fluffing her curls , tingling her car keys . " All set ? " she asked . " All set . " They walked out to her enormous old Ford . Delia fitted her carton among a tangle of real estate signs in the trunk , and then the two of them got in the car and Bells started the engine . With the seat-belt alarm insistently dinging , they pulled away from the curl ) .  | It was months since Delia had ridden in a car . The scenery glided past so quickly , and so smoothly ! She gripped her door handle as they swung around the corner , and then zip ! zip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Potpourri Palace . In no time , they were turning onto Pendle Street and parking in the Millers ' gravel driveway  --  a trip that had taken her at least ten minutes , walking . " My parents live in a house like this , " Belle said . She was peering through the windshield at the cut-out designs of covered wagons on the shutters . " Li a suburb of York , P.A. Dee , are you sure you want to do this ? " " Oh , yes , " Delia said weakly . " You 'll be nothing but a servant ! " " It 's better than being a typewriter , " Delia told her . " Well , if you 're going to put it that way . " Delia climbed out of the car , and Belle came around to help her maneuver her box from the trunk . " Thanks , " Delia said . " You have my phone number . " " I have it . " " I 'll let you know when 's a good time to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle said . " Or supposing you want to move back ! I 'll wait a few days before I try renting your room . " They might have gone on this way forever , but at that moment Noah burst out the front door . " Delia ! Hi ! " he called . " Ms. Grinstead to you , " Belle muttered under her breath . She told Delia , " Do n't you let them treat you like a peon . " Delia just hugged her and turned toward the house . How the Millers treated her was the least of her concerns , she thought . The question was how to beat them -- what distance to maintain from this mop-headed , blue jeaned boy . It was so easy to fall back into being someone 's mother ! She smiled at him as he lifted the carton from her arms . " I can manage that , " she said . " I 'm supposed to carry your luggage . Dad told me . Do n't you have anything mre ? " he asked . Belle was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it , " Delia said .

" " Oh , then why did you change them ? "  | " Dad said if they did n't still have their laundry smell you might think someone else had slept in them . " " I would n't think that , " she assured him . They walked through the living room , where the cushions lined the couch in last week 's exact formation and the magazines had not varied their positions by an inch . The carpet in the hall was freshly vacuumed , though . She could see the roller marks in the nap . And when they entered the guest room , Noah placed her box on a folding luggage stand that had definitely not been there earlier . " It 's new , " he said , noticing her glance . " We bought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very nice . " " And lookit here , " he said . On the bureau sat a tiny television set . " Color TV ! From Lawson Appliance . Dad says a live-in woman always has her own TV . " " Oh , I do n't need a ? " " Clock radio , " Noah said , " decorator box of Kleenex ... " What touched her most , though , was how they 'd turned the bedcovers down  --  that effortful white triangle . She said , " You should n't have . " And she meant it , for the sight made her feel indebted , somehow . She followed Noah to the closet , where he was displaying the hangers . " ' Three dozen matching hangers , solid plastic , pink . Not a wire one in the bunch . We had our choice between pink or white or brown . " " Pink is perfect , " she told him . Three dozen ! It would disappoint them to find out how few clothes she owned . " Now I 'm supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I 'll be in my room if there 's anything you need . " " Thank you , Noah . " " You know where my room is ? " " I can find it . " " And you 're supposed to unpack and put your stuff in drawers and all . " I 'll do that , " she promised . As he left he glanced back at her doubtfully , as if he worried she would n't follow instructions . tier carton looked so shabby , resting on the needlepoint webbing of the luggage stand . She walked over to it and lifted the flaps , and out floated the lonesome , stale , hornet's-nest smell of the room on George Street . Well . She took off her coat , hung it on one of the hangers . Draped  | her purse strap over a hook . Drew the goosenecked lamp from the box but then had nowhere to put it , for the room already contained two lamps , shaded in rigid white satin . Still holding the goosenecked lamp ( with its helmet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the cat had knocked it over one night ) , she sat down limply on the edge of the bed . She had to brace her feet so as not to slide off the slick coverlet . It was one of those hotel-type beds that seem at once too springy and too hard , and she could n't imagine getting used to it . Elsewhere in the house she heard a door open , a set of heavy footsteps , a man 's voice calling and Noah answering . She would have to rearrange her face and go join them . Any minute now , she would . But for a while she went on sitting there , clutching her homely little lamp and gathering courage . At the rear of the house , divided from the kitchen by only a counter , lay what the Millers called the family room . Here the stuffy decorating style relaxed into something more casual . A long , low couch faced a TV , an office desk stood against one wall , and three armchairs were grouped in a corner . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , Delia 's territory . ( She had always wanted a more modern house , without cubbies or nooks or crannies . ) In the mornings , when she was through cleaning , she sat at the desk to write her grocery list . She went out for several hours then  --  usually on foot , even though she had a car at her disposal  --  but afternoons would find her puttering between family room and kitchen while Noah did his homework on the couch . Evenings , she read in one of the armchairs while Noah watched TV . Sometimes Mr. Miller watched too  --  or Joel , as she had to remind herself to call him  --  in which case she retired early with her hook . She was a little shy with Mr. Miller : Joel . ' I'Iiis was such an awkward situation , businesslike and yet at the sank time necessarily intimate . But usually he had meetings to go to , or he spent the evening at his workbench in the garage . She suspected he felt the awkwardness too . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They liked plain food , plainly prepared  --  roast beef and broiled chicken and burgers . Noah hated vegetables but was required to eat one spoonful each night . Mr. Miller was probably no fonder of them , but he worked his way conscientiously through everything , and he always told her , " Dinner is delicious , Delia . " She suspected he would have said  | that no matter what she served . He asked her several courteous questions at every meal ( had her day gone well ? was she finding what she needed ? ) , but she sensed he did n't listen to her answers . This was a sad , sad man underneath , and sometimes even when his own son spoke there was a moment of silence before he pulled himself together to reply . " Guess what ! " Noah might say . " Kenny Moss just got a humongous golden retriever . Dad , can we get a golden retriever ? " Long pause . Clinking of china . Then finally : " There is no such word as humongous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just used it ? " And the two of them would be off on one of their arguments . Delia had never known anyone as particular about words as Joel Miller . He despised all terms that were trendy ( including " trendy " itself ) . He refused to agree that something was " neat " unless it was , literally , tidy . He interrupted one of Noah 's most animated stories with the observation that no one could be " into " mountain climbing . But he always spoke with good humor , which probably explained why Noah still ventured to open his mouth . Fastened to Delia 's bathroom door was a full-length mirror , the first she had faced in six months , outside of a changing booth ; and she was startled to see how thin she had grown . Her hipbones were sharp little chips , and the tops of her dresses looked hollow . So she served herself large helpings at these suppers , and she breakfasted with Noah every morning , and she walked to Rick-Rack 's each noon to dine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making good money now and had nothing else to spend it on . Rick also served pork barbecue , the vinegary kind she was partial to , as it turned out . " You know , " she told him , " I never had much of a chance to try a real meal here . I knew you were a good cook , but I did n't know how good . " " And here you been taking your Sunday dinners at that la-di-da Bay Arms ! " he said . Was there anything about her this whole town did n't know ? After lunch , she crossed the street to pay a visit to George . He was in a snit with her for leaving . He showed up as soon as she let herself in but then turned his back pointedly and stalked off . " George ? " she wheedled . No response . He marched into Belle 's living room and vanished . Delia waited iii the hall , and a moment later a telltale sprig of whiskers poked around the edge of the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
