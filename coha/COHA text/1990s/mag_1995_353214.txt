FATHER GREG ( LINUS ROACHE ) , the young priest at a Catholic parish in Liverpool , is handsome , theologically conservative  --  and gay . His boss , Father Matthew ( Tom Wilkinson ) , spouts socialist dogma and has sex with his live-in housekeeper . The husband of the parish 's hardest-working volunteer forces sex on their daughter . The local bishop is a ward heeler in a cassock . <P> Priest , then , is no Going My Way . And Good Friday was perhaps not the ideal day for Miramax Films to schedule Priest for wide release . Small wonder that a few of the faithful were miffed . The Catholic League threatened a boycott of Miramax 's owner , the Walt Disney Co. , before Miramax moved the date back . Disney hardly needs the aggravation ; last week it told Miramax that the studio could not distribute Kids , a scalding and graphic film about an HIV-positive teen . If Kids receives a proscriptive nc-17 rating , Miramax may be obliged to sell the film ( with its hefty $3.5 million price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Antonia Bird , is sensational only in its content . At heart it is a TV drama with a one-track mind ; Jimmy McGovern 's script has no fewer than four scenes in which someone intrudes on a couple 's sexual intimacy . Bird cues every emotion with spell-it-out reaction shots and a soupy sound track . What movie dares use You 'll Never Walk Alone with no irony ? Priest does , which is one reason why it leaves fat , hot tears on many spectators ' faces . The film delivers on its promise to edify at any cost . <P> For many modern Catholics , the question of a gay clergy inspires a big shrug . Why should n't homosexuals ( and women ) be priests ? These days , they are among the few who want to be . The real issue , blithely dodged in this movie , is the Catholic sin of giving scandal . A priest is , after all , Christ 's salesman and stand-in . He need not be infallible  --  since he is human and conceived in sin-but he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for old Matthew to keep a woman quietly in the rectory ; it is another for young Greg to go cruising in a gay bar near his parish . Or surrender to rapture on a public beach . Or have oral sex in a car on the street . Poor Greg : he may not be damned , but he surely is dense . <P> If Greg were to come to this confessor , his penance would be 10 Hail Marys and an I.Q. test . As for Priest , it would be made to sit in sackcloth and ashes at the church door as a cautionary example to all filmmakers who truckle to noble sentiment .
