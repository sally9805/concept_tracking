A female honey bee worker flying on a hot day has to contend not only with the sun 's withering heat but also with her own internal furnace . To drive her wings , the honey bee contracts the powerful flight muscles in her thorax some 200 times per second , a process that produces a tremendous amount of heat . The honey bee 's internal temperature would reach lethal levels ( 118deg-122deg F ) and the insect would " fry " internally in a minute or two of flight if not for her small size and for the air flow she generates during flight , which allows heat to escape by convection . Landing on a clover blossom to forage on a windless day , however , the honey bee faces the full brunt of the sun 's burning rays . Although she has stopped flying , her temperature could still become dangerously high . Having filled her honeycrop with nectar and loaded her pollen baskets , the honey bee worker flies straight back to her colony , which is packed with the pressing bodies of tens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a few adaptations in their physiology and behavior , honey bees survive and prosper even in hot deserts . Much has been made of the advantages of bees ' staying hot . For example , flight muscles need to be hot enough to contract rapidly during flight , and the nest has to be warm enough to incubate the young so that they can grow quickly . But being able to cool down also has its advantages . In the immediate sense , it can keep the bees from frying ; in the long term , it can also save energy . The biochemical motor that drives the bees ' wings can not be totally shut off , and its idling speed doubles with every 18deg F increase in temperature . Therefore , prolonged high temperatures can cause the bees ' quickened metabolisms to bum considerably more energy . Most large flying insects have evolved a mechanism to prevent overheating during flight ; blood circulating through the flight motor carries heat from the thorax to the abdomen , which gets rid of the heat , much as the coolant circulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey bee 's peculiar anatomy , however , makes this impossible . The tube that carries the blood from the abdomen into the thorax is thrown into tight coils in the petiole area , the narrow passage that links the two sections of the body . This means that hot blood leaving the thorax must flow around these coils , heating the cool blood being pumped into the thorax  --  and very little heat escapes into the abdomen . This inability to use their abdomen as a heat radiator may appear to be a handicap , but it probably serves the honeybees well when they are flying in cool weather . Relying on convection to unload excess heat has its limitations , however ; it only works if the body is hotter than the surrounding air . A radiator may increases the area for convective cooling , but it relies on convection nevertheless . Honey bees have evolved a totally different cooling system that may be the most efficient of any insect , one that has allowed them to abandon the abdominal heat radiator altogether . When a foraging honey bee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffices to keep her head temperature below 113deg F , a thermal sensor there triggers the response to regurgitate nectar from her honeycrop onto her tongue . Exposed to the air , water from nectar evaporates , cooling the bee 's head , and drawing heat away from the adjacent thorax . She can increase the rate of evaporation by " wagging " her tongue and by smearing some of the liquid on the front of her thorax . Evaporative cooling is the only way the bee can lower her temperature below that of the ambient air . A further advantage of relying on evaporation is that while the forager is cooling herself , she is simultaneously reducing the load of excess water she is carrying and saving energy . By carrying less water , the forager also has extra space to transport more calories to the hive . On returning , the forager may still be hot , but now she is subjected to the metabolic heat of thousands of her hivemates . The bee quickly passes her nectar to one of the receiver bees that stay within the hive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hot , these receivers eagerly take up the nectar and cool themselves and the hive by regurgitating it so that it evaporates from their own mouthparts , as well as from droplets they deposit in the honeycombs . As a result , the humidity of the hive shoots up , which stimulates some of the workers to fan the entrances to the hive . This brings in drier air , making more evaporation possible . If , on the other hand , the weather is cool , few receiver bees will be willing to unload foragers bringing in dilute nectar . Instead , the receiver bees now only accept foragers bringing in concentrated forage . Thus , receiver bees can manipulate the foragers to bring in dilute or concentrated nectar , depending on the temperature . Bees in the core of the hive can also become dangerously overheated in the winter . The outermost bees may be cool , some even approaching their minimum tolerable temperature of 59deg F , but as the air temperature outside drops , the temperature at the center of the cluster rises . For many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some way of communicating with the bees in the core who could , by regulating their own heat output , produce more or less heat as needed . But experiments failed to show any such communication . Further studies revealed that their body temperature rises , the core bees produce more heat as they heat up . But why did the core bees get hotter as outside temperatures were lowered ? The answer lies with the mantle , or outer , bees . They are the ones who control core temperature . When honey bees are in a cluster , they allow their body temperature to " float " passively over a wide range , whereas solitary individuals shiver to maintain a thoracic temperature of about 92deg F at all times , presumably to be instantly ready for flight . As their temperature declines , the mantle bees ' first line of defense is not shivering . Instead , they merely crawl into the inside of the swarm cluster . Increased huddling shrinks the cluster , and air passages to the outside become plugged . Eventually , the outside bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their abdomens stick out . Heat loss of the cluster is then at a minimum , and if the swarm is a large one , the core temperature may shoot up to within several degrees of lethal temperatures . For every action there is a reaction , and the overheated core bees are not passive . They crawl toward the cooler periphery , thus creating holes that let out heat , warming the exterior bees and causing them to crowd less tightly . Normally , both responses occur simultaneously in any one swarm in a dynamic process , and one only sees the net effect as the bees continually shift their position within the hive . Only when the swarm is subjected to sudden temperature changes are the separate actions noticeable . If a swarm is suddenly taken from room temperature to subfreezing temperature , the outside bees feel the temperature change first . They immediately clump , and swarm core temperature shoots up before core bees get a chance to respond . Conversely , when the swarm is suddenly taken from subzero temperature to room temperature , the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The power of the mantle bees to affect core temperature is well illustrated by the defensive reaction of the Asian honey bee to predatory hornets . In Japan , the honey bee Apis cerana confronts a species of large , heavily armored hornets , Vespa simillina , that prey on them . These hornets often patrol in front of an entrance to a weak hive and snatch one bee after another , sometimes depopulating whole hives . The hornets are heavily armed against bee stings , but they are not immune to the lethal effect of overheating , which the honey bees have exploited as a defense . At strong hives , the hornets may first be grabbed and held by several bee defenders , and then 200 to 300 bees will cluster tightly around the attacker . These defensive bees are already hotter than those just flying off to forage , and as they form a ball around the hornet they continue to shiver . Temperatures at the core of these small clusters , where the unfortunate hornet is held fast , soar to 115deg F. Because the hornets ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 113deg-116deg F versus 118deg-122deg F ) , the victim at the center of the bee ball dies . <p>
