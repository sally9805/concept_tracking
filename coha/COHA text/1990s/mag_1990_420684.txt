Section : The Up &; Comers Competitors " I firmly believe in nepotism , " says Biocraft Laboratories ' Harold Snyder , whose family is doing very nicely as sales of generic drugs continue to grow . <p> HAROLD SNYDER , chairman of Biocraft Laboratories , Inc. , does n't care much about what people think of him . Six years ago the thick-skinned and combative entrepreneur shocked a New York City audience of fellow generic drug industry executives by lambasting a congressman who had just given a speech about speeding up Food &; Drug Administration approval of generics . " You politicians , " he shouted , " all you do is talk , talk , talk . " <p> Snyder , 68 , can afford to be outspoken . He and his wife , Beatrice , 66 , with whom he cofounded Biocraft in 1964 , pride themselves on having built the company , headquartered in Fair Lawn , N.J. , into the leading maker of generic antibiotics . Along the way , they have amassed a fortune worth nearly $100 million . <p> Generic drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than branded drug makers , and pass most of the savings on to consumers ; that 's why generics cost 50% less than brand-name products . But success is harder than it may look . The trick is to be the first on the market , because with competition , prices and margins quickly erode . <p> Here 's how it works : Biocraft submits to the FDA an Abbreviated New Drug Application , in anticipation of a branded drug 's patent expiration . Instead of recreating the extensive clinical tests of the branded drug company , Biocraft has only to show bio-equivalence  --  the drug should have the same therapeutic effects . Then comes the waiting time . The Food &; Drug Administration claims bio-equivalence tests take about 2 years . Snyder says the wait is more like 31/2 years . <p> Every month Snyder and his team pick a number of drugs they want to market . They 're now awaiting approval on 25 drugs that will go off patent in the next five years . Biocraft 's niche is antibiotics ; penicillins alone accounted for 39% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitors , including Mylan Laboratories and Barr Laboratories , buy the chemical compounds from which they produce their generic drugs . Biocraft does it a different way . It makes its own raw materials . This strategy gives Snyder a cost advantage , enables him to be first on the market with a drug , and puts a big dent in the competition . Biocraft , for instance , might be the only company capable of manufacturing Cefaclor , an antibiotic now sold by Eli Lilly under the name Ceclor , which goes off patent in 1992 and has $750 million in sales . Cefaclor is highly complicated to make , and the raw materials can be hard to find . <p> Because he makes the raw materials , Snyder has more control over price and quality and can assure delivery to his customers , mainly wholesalers , distributors and drug chains . Lederle and Goldline laboratories are his biggest customers , accounting for 23% of Biocraft 's business . <p> Since Biocraft went public in 1985 its sales have grown from $34.2 million to $107 million ( in the fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaged slightly more than 14% , fairly good for a generic drug company . <p> By contrast with the rapid sales growth , Biocraft 's earnings have been weak during the past two years . In 1988 an FDA drug scandal that involved payoffs from some other generic drug makers slowed down new drug approvals . This crimped earnings across the generic drug industry . And recently , after a long court battle , Biocraft lost a patent infringement lawsuit to giant Bristol-Myers Squibb . As a result , Biocraft had to disburse $11 million as part of an overall $21 million settlement ( the other $10 million will be paid out over the next seven years ) . Thanks to that initial settlement , Biocraft 's earnings fell 60% this past fiscal year , to $3.2 million , or just 23 cents per common share . <p> Is the little company in danger ? Jerry Treppel , a Furman Selz analyst who has followed the firm for three years , does n't think so : " From a cash perspective , this Biocraft 's settlement is almost a nonevent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cash in fiscal 1990 , and reasonable debt . The company 's R &D; expenses have n't been affected , and in fact increased this year by 11% , to $6 million . <p> To recoup his losses to Bristol-Myers , Snyder is betting on Cefaclor . He is also expanding his manufacturing facilities by opening a $38 million plant in Mexico , Mo . The plant , which should be operational by April , will start making the chemical compounds for all its antibiotics , and eventually Cefaclor . <p> The Missouri plant was a smart investment . The 120-acre site was purchased for a mere $2 from the state , which is looking to attract investments . Operational costs are much lower than in New Jersey . Power costs alone are 60% to 75% less . Snyder 's other move is to diversify outside of the antibiotics field , to include ulcer and cancer treatment drugs . <p> Snyder , a Brooklyn , N.Y . native , earned a master 's in natural science from Columbia University in 1948 . He then landed a series of jobs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make drugs . " They drove me crazy , " says Snyder of his partners , so he quit in 1964 and struck out on his own . <p> With $13,000 of his wife 's inheritance money , he started a 6,000-square-foot drug plant in Elmwood Park , N.J. " I was basically concentrating on antibiotics , " Snyder says , because that 's what he knew best . <p> The whole family  --  the Snyders own 64% of Biocraft 's 14 million common shares outstanding  --  is now involved in the business . Snyder 's wife , Beatrice , is senior vice president . Their three children  --  Beryl , 33 , and twins Brian and Jay , 32  --  all went to work for the company after completing their schooling ; all are recently promoted vice presidents . <p> That strikes some people as being too much of a family affair , particularly since the Snyders have even argued over policy in front of analysts . Snyder shrugs the qualms aside . " I firmly believe in nepotism , " he says . " And the reason I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well for me . " Except for this year , when the stock price followed the earnings down , it has also worked well for the shareholders . <p> What 's in Biocraft 's future ? About a third of all drugs prescribed in this country today are generics . But as the health insurance companies continue to crack down on costs , this proportion should reach 60% in 1995 , representing a $10 billion market . Biocraft and the Snyder clan should continue to be big players . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Biocraft plant in Fairfield , N.J.
