It could easily be argued that Steven Chu is the most high-profile energy secretary this country has seen . The Nobel Prize in physics he won in 1997 does n't hurt . But it 's the task before him -- helping carry out President Obama 's ambitious energy goals -- that 's fueling the attention . As the top voice at the Department of Energy , Chu is inheriting an agency that spends much of its budget on weapons protection and cleanup but is now being asked to play a leading role in transforming the country 's energy supply . U.S. News recently spoke with Chu . Excerpts : You 've been immersed in research for much of your career . What do you see as science 's role in addressing energy problems ? There have to be some breakthroughs . Our current solar technology is silicon photocells . I think it will go down in price by a factor of two , maybe more , within the next decade . However , if you step back and ask , What would it take for a utility company to start putting hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the land is cheap ? What 's preventing this from happening ? It 's the cost of installment -- capital costs . So we do need a breakthrough . We need a breakthrough of a factor of five in the overall cost of the system . We need a breakthrough in energy storage technology . We need the next-generation photovoltaics . The stimulus package includes $400 million for a new Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy . What 's its mission ? What I 'd like to see it do is make investments in very high-risk efforts , very much in a venture capital mode , where you sprinkle money on various projects , give each one a three-year leash , and say , " Is this going to work or not ? " If it looks like it 's going to work , if it 's going to have a life of its own , you can fund it with more money , or venture capitalists will pick it up . So it 's high risk but high reward , meaning we would like to invest in very , very innovative things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a success , it could be game changing . What types of projects would be included ? It would include biofuels ; it would include photovoltaics ; it would include game-changing solutions to building buildings more efficiently . It does n't have to be all on the supply side . On the demand side , there can be a lot of innovation . I 'm a big believer . People sometimes say energy efficiency and conservation are not sexy ; they 're low tech . That 's actually not true . They can be very sexy and very high tech . Right now , we do n't have adequate software tools for designing heating ventilation systems and integrating them with the passive design of the building . Does the government need more authority to build transmission lines to promote renewable energy ? This is a very complicated problem . People recognize that if we are going to take full advantage of our renewable-energy resources , we need to transport energy from faraway places with low population densities . So it 's not only more authority . You have to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where these lines go through . If we just take the view that we are going to cram something down someone 's throat , this is not a constructive way of doing business . Having said that , there is going to be a need for taking full advantage of the resources in renewable energy in the United States . So what 's the first step ? The biggest gains , in terms of decreasing the country 's energy bill , the amount of carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere , and our dependency on foreign oil , will come from energy efficiency and conservation in the next 20 years . Make no doubt about it . That 's where everybody who has really thought about the problem thinks the biggest gains can be and should be . What 's limiting these gains ? There are initial investment barriers . And this is where , for example , in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , a lot of the money is being targeted . But we want to also be looking systemically how to do this . How so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done a study that says for $1,000 extra in material and labor , that investment could pay for itself in one and a half years , and you could save a tremendous amount of energy . In terms of new homes and buildings , part of it is regulatory . But you 've also got to convince people -- they 've got to believe in their heart and soul -- that a small , minor upfront cost will actually decrease their monthly bill .
