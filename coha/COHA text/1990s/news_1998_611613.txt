<p> On the eve of the 1991 Persian Gulf War , Russian special envoy Yevgeny Primakov went to Baghdad and announced he had won agreement from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to withdraw his forces peacefully from Kuwait . No one listened . Allied bombs soon fell over Iraq , and within six weeks , Kuwait was liberated by force . <p> Last fall , as foreign minister , Primakov went to Baghdad again . This time , his aim was to persuade Saddam Hussein to let United Nations weapons inspectors continue to work in Iraq . The threat of bombing was again in play . But this time , the planes stayed on the runway , Primakov 's persuasion was given a chance and , at least for a time , it worked . <p> At a minimum , the activity represented Russia 's return to the Middle East after a long period as a wallflower . But the episode also underlined Primakov 's campaign to put Russia back on the global map . <p> Steadily , during two years in office and to the cheers of nationalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia 's foreign policy . He has altered Russian priorities from a primary focus on relations with the United States to an effort to move out from under the American shadow . <p> His strategy is to replace what he regards as U.S. dominance of world affairs with a " multipolar " system balancing a number of powers in which Russia will have a key role . <p> Observers here and abroad often describe the change as a way to relive the days when the Soviet Union was one of two global superpowers . But Primakov seems to regard the shift as a necessity . Russia is weak and , in many cases , no longer able to play one-on-one with Washington . Multipolarity is the antidote to weakness . <p> " We have grounds to believe that the world is moving toward a multipolar structure , and this requires Russia to work on all fronts . . . . We understand that today we are weaker than the United States , " he wrote in a recent self-appreciation of his foreign policy achievements in 1997 . <p> He goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presuppose conflict with Washington . " The protection of our state interests went along various directions . . . without a return to the Cold War , " he wrote . And he went on to pat himself on the back : " No major event can now take place without the direct involvement of Russia . " <p> Sergei Karaganov , a foreign policy expert and Primakov supporter , described the strategy as " seeking to put together blocs of influence in which Russia plays key roles . " <p> Some of these blocs include countries with which the United States is in low-intensity conflict . Russia 's attitude creates a new and sometimes uncomfortable foreign policy environment for Washington . <p> This climate may come into play as soon as this week . President Clinton is considering whether to punish Iraq with airstrikes in response to Saddam Hussein 's interference with the work of U.N . weapons inspectors . Russia , under Primakov 's tutelage , resolutely opposes the use of force . <p> More generally , Primakov opposes the Clinton administration policy of " dual containment " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran . He has renewed contacts with Libya and even revisited Cuba , an old Soviet client . <p> He also keeps up a drumbeat of hostile rhetoric in response to NATO expansion proposals , especially in regard to the three Baltic states that were once part of the Soviet Union . <p> As a result , Washington has had to adapt to a more combative tone than the congenial approach of Primakov 's predecessor , Andrei Kozyrev . A senior State Department official said there " is no mincing of words " between Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Primakov . <p> " Their ability to do business is based on the mutual recognition that both are going to speak their minds , " he said . <p> Primakov , 68 , is a veteran of Russia 's KGB , and he headed the foreign intelligence branch of its successor organization from 1991 to 1996 . His code name in his younger days was Maxim . <p> He has long experience in the Middle East . For instance , Primakov has known Saddam Hussein since 1969 and wrote about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Pravda newspaper . <p> Some associates regard his yearning for Russia to be a major international player as generational . " He wants to restore the status of Russia , " supporter Karaganov said . " He is part of a generation that falls prey to the need for status . " <p> Acquaintances say he is reserved in public but charming and witty with his close friends . And he reportedly is a seasoned toastmaster . It is a talent some attribute to his childhood in Georgia , whose citizens Russians regard as masters of hospitality . <p> He was appointed by President Boris Yeltsin to placate foreign policy critics before the 1996 presidential election . Fans and foes of Primakov agree he has made foreign policy an issue of little controversy and an unusual island of tranquillity for the president . <p> " Yeltsin wanted to pacify his opponents on the foreign policy front , and Primakov provided an answer . As long as quiet is what Yeltsin wants , Primakov will stay on , " said Maxim Ioussine , a columnist for the Izvestia newspaper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Primakov is still winning applause here for his performance in Iraq last fall and freely offers public advice to Washington  --  balm for nationalist ears irritated by the steady stream of American advice over the past several years . " We would like the American approach to be less emotionally charged , " Primakov told Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper . <p> He said that Washington and Moscow agree that Saddam Hussein must destroy his chemical and biological weapons , but Russia opposes use of force and believes that Iraq must be sure there is a " light at the end of the tunnel " of sanctions . <p> As for Iran , Primakov acknowledges that Russian scientists may be helping Tehran build missiles , but they are freelancers who are difficult to stop . " We can not rule out a brain drain , " he said . " Some leakage at the personal level , so to speak , is possible . We are trying to combat it . " <p> In any case , he added , he resolutely rejects Washington 's efforts to get Russia to cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia has proved a vexing issue for Primakov , and his performance has received mixed reviews , even from admirers . On the one hand , he was able to formalize consultations with NATO through creation of a NATO-Russian council . On the other hand , expansion went ahead , with Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic invited to join . Other former Warsaw Pact states , not to mention the Baltic threesome of Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia , aspire to membership . <p> Primakov recently has tried to draw the line at the Baltics . " We must not agree to this entrance . I 'm sure it will be very hard for Russians to realize that the infrastructure we created and left in those states would serve the armed forces of other states . The alternative for those countries is neutrality , " he said . <p> Although Primakov preaches multipolarity , with respect to former republics of the Soviet Union , Russia is No. 1 . Relations have become strained with several of the republics , and some analysts attribute the tensions to suspicions that Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Primakov warned that no outside power can replace Russia on its periphery . " Even when other countries are involved , Russia is the prime mover , because this is an area adjacent to us , where we are established , whose people we know and where we have connections , " he said . <p> Conversations about Primakov inevitably turn toward comparisons with his predecessor , Kozyrev . Many analysts label Kozyrev a Westernizer who regarded lock-step policy with the West as an extension of Russia 's internal reforms . Primakov inevitably is described as more in the Russian tradition of looking eastward . <p> Said Igor Golembovsky , editor of Novye Izvestia newspaper , " Primakov is more like a map of Russia : part in Europe , part in Asia .
