When there are more people than moguls on my favorite bump runs , when all the magnificently manicured interstates become gridlocked , when the only powder lines are leftovers  --  there 's one place I know will be mine : the trees . Of course , ducking into the trees is the obvious move when all the powder on the regular runs has been sliced and diced and flattened , but there 's more to the lure of the woods than just one more run of freshies . There 's a feeling I get when I veer off the marked and machined runs . Like a slight electrical charge  --  an outlawish tingle  --  that wriggles down my neck . I feel out of bounds  --  astray . Shades of childhood hide and seek , tree forts , secret clubs . After the first 20 turns , I stop and listen to the quiet . A muffled thud comes as a tree unburdens itself of a bough 's worth of heavy snow . I imagine , there in my little glen , that I might know how early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scythes felled the mysterious glades . Before slopeside condos . And I savor the feeling of being allowed in this magical place . Then I point down an unknown line . Thin alleys open . Light and shadow are my guides as I move into open spaces . Cranking to the rhythm of the woods , the trees come quickly . Hard objects whooshing within inches of soft flesh gives new appreciation for speed . Branches reach out . I veer and duck and cavort , a halfback on an end run , cutting and dancing . Here I 'm completely responsible for myself  --  the way it should be . I 'll not blame anyone if I bite bark  --  it 's all up to reflexes ; skill , and luck . No time for plans . Look , turn , duck , turn , block a branch , turn , look .... Suddenly , a trail . The world looks big again . Adrenaline still surging . The thrill of the near miss . Twenty near misses . Uncontained laughter . Tree skiing 's not for everyone . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make quick parallel turns at will . If you ca n't confidently descend an expert trail , tree skiing will only scare the bejeezus out of you . There is a firm reality to a tree . Assuming you have the prerequisite ability , however , it 's a hoot . Here 's how to do it . TECHNIQUE I prefer to keep my feet a little less than shoulder-width apart . The less wide-tracked you are , the less chance of hooking a tree with a ski tip . You 'll have to change your weight distribution according to the snow , but generally I keep almost equal weight on both my skis , riding a platform , rather than driving one ski . If the snow is firm and debris well covered , I stay on the balls of my feet , which is a better balanced position for making quick turns . But if there 's a chance the snow is rotten ( that is , wo n't support my weight and will therefore collapse ) or I suspect fallen trees to be close under the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my tips up a little . There are two ways to turn a ski  --  carving and steering . Carving means putting the ski on edge and weighting it . The energy stored in the ski , when you bend it like this , propels the ski into the next turn . Steering means turning the ski by turning your feet and pointing your knees in the direction you want your skis to go . Most skiers use a combination of carving and steering . In tight trees , it 's best to steer more than carve . Because the snow 's often suspect , driving your downhill ski into the snow enough to load it for a carve may cause an unwanted submarining of the ski ( which of course is followed by an over-the-bow dive ) . In trees , you 'll also need to change direction quickly , and unless you 're a master of carving , you 'll probably not be quick enough . Steer with your knees and feet , while keeping your upper body upright and facing straight down the hill ( similar to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to counterrotate your upper body ( turn it in the opposite direction that your skis are turning ) but try to stay away from this , as it often leaves you with all your weight on your uphill edge and can cause cartwheeling . ROUTE FINDING Just as every racecourse or mogul field has a rhythm to it , so do trees . The trick is finding it . Many skiers new to the trees will rush in , make several blissful turns , then panic as they find they 've picked up too much speed , gotten out of sync with the pattern of the woods . It 's best to duck in at a medium pace . Too slow and you 'll bog down , too fast and you might eat pine needles . Just as picking the right line through the first four gates of a racecourse will set you up for the rest of the course , your first half-dozen tree turns will set your tempo . Start deliberately , exaggerating your pole plants and exhaling fully with each turn . Now that you 're moving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving . Just as as you ca n't get into your bump rhythm if you stop after four moguls , stopping in the middle of the trees will prevent you from finding the flow . Keep yourself moving , even if it means traversing until another line opens up . Gaps , of course , are the key . You want to move into them as they open for you . Look for spaces , not at the trees . Although this sounds elementary , the natural inclination is to look right at the trees , which makes them seem unavoidable . I 'm not talking denial here  --  the trees are there  --  you just do n't need to inspect the lichen as you go by . Also , as in good mogul skiing , you must look down the hill , past the next open space to the one after that . You do n't need to look at what you 're skiing . A combination of your peripheral vision and your body 's ability to react will take care of what 's underfoot . Keep your eyes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depending on your level of confidence and faith in your reactions , this may be a bit scary at first . One way to ease into it is the swallow-swoop . Just as a swallow will dip and dive in and out of the trees , you can start on an open , groomed run , duck into the trees for four or five turns , then swoop out . Readjust your balance and reset your fear threshold , then duck back in as soon as you find an entrance . This technique will also help your reconnaissance of the tree run you 'd like to ski . It 's critical that you never just drop into the trees without first doing some research to find out what 's in there . Although we 're talking about in-bounds trees here , the condition of these tree islands differs greatly from area to area . Some resorts , like Killington ( on Big Dipper ) and Steamboat clear the deadfall and thin the trees to encourage tree skiing , while others use the trees as ad hoc dumping grounds for the timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the runs on either side of the tree island in question , you 'll get a feel for what 's on the ground , and also learn about possible cliffs . If you can , study your trees from the lift before jumping in . Another way to find out about your intended lair is to ask a local . Ski patrollers may also be helpful , but more often than not , they 'll just tell you not to ski the trees , which is understandable , because if you do get hurt in there , it 's that much harder for them to drag you out . SAFETY And speaking of misfortune , let me offer a couple of safety tips . First off  --  although this may seem painfully obvious  --  if you 've never skied trees before , start on an intermediate-level pitch with trees that are spaced at least 10 feet apart . And whenever you ski the trees , make sure your pole straps are off your wrists . Catching a pole basket in the crotch of a tree or in a submerged bush can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket without the pole strap on , it will harmlessly fly from your hand . Better to hike back up for your pole than play a painful game of put the ball back in the socket . Keep your hands held high between pole plants  --  a very good idea for two reasons : Exaggerating the upward motion of a pole plant helps to unweight the skis and allows for a bit of float in the end of the turn ( an old powder ploy ) , and keeping your hands up will also help protect your face from unfriendly branches or angry squirrels . Another precaution : Wear goggles . Sunglasses wo n't prevent branches from getting to your eyes . Goggles will . Light red , pink , or yellow lenses work best for tree skiing ( I wear a vermilion lens for all but completely cloudless days ) . The light is always changing in the trees and vision becomes extremely important when large immovable objects are to be dealt with . Hats with pom-poms and flapping hoods are other bad ideas . If anything can snag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees is to wait for more than a 36-inch snow base . Anything less than that is insufficient to cover fallen trees , stumps , and rocks . Although I admit to occasionally grabbing a tree trunk to make a panic stop , I do n't recommend it . Should an alley ( a thin line between trees ) suddenly come to a dead end , it 's best to know escape routes . Paying attention to peripheral vision will reveal these off-ramps , so avoid tunnel vision . When all else fails , it 's better to sit down than grab a tree . If there 's absolutely no way to avoid a tree , it 's best to do a second-base type of slide into it , going in feet first , with your boots up . Think of the tree in question as an ugly second baseman . Again , this is only in the most severe and extreme of circumstances . Another potential danger is tree wells , the black holes of inner space . Wind or a sturdy canopy of branches can prevent snow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can leave fragile snow near the tree 's base that can , if you ski too close to it , cave in and send you toppling in . One such tree well at Snowbird , Utah , took exception to my skiing close to it , and promptly sucked me in , upside down . The tails of my skis got hung up in a branch and I dangled like a rabbit in a snare . Efforts to click out were futile ( DIN setting : 15 ) . Snow washed in over my head as my temples pounded out a crazed death toll . I could n't undo my bindings . ( Which brings to mind the other glaring mistake I 'd made : I 'd been tree skiing alone . ) My solitary world turned from white , to gray to black . I bounced , tugged , wriggled , and squirmed . Finally , the tree had taught me my lesson , and I heard a merciful crack from the branch that held my skis . I tumbled into the bottom of the well , them scrambled breathlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I never ski trees alone . So accept the fact that skiing in the trees is simply not as safe as skiing on open , groomed runs . Never will be . Trees , for all their sublime elegance , present a dangerous hazard when you 're whizzing through at 20 miles an hour . Plan on being a little scared . an on feeling devilish . And if all goes right , plan on feeling a private thrilling joy that skiing may not have given you in years .
