<p> ON SEPTEMBER 7 Vice President Al Gore presented the Report of the National Performance Review , promising to reduce both the budget deficit and the trust deficit ' by reinventing government . The theme is that government officials and civil servants should be treated like responsible adults . The government should rely more on incentives and less on controls , increasing flexibility in exchange for increased accountability . The regulation of federal managers and the level of unfunded mandates on state and local governments should be massively reduced . No longer would agencies be required to purchase supplies and support services through monopoly purchasing agencies . Bureaucracy , paperwork , and waste would be reduced by increased competition , both from private suppliers and from other agencies . ( David Osborne , the author of Reinventing Government , apparently read my 1971 book , Bureaucracy and Representative Government . ) Government would operate more like a business . <p> On September 22 , President Clinton summarized his complex plan to reform American health care , a major reorganization of this huge sector of the economy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often the case , he was very articulate in describing the benefits of his proposed plan . The theme of this plan is very different from that of the Gore report . Patients and physicians are to be treated not as responsible adults but as pawns in a massive experiment in social engineering . The plan would rely more on controls and less on incentives , reducing the range of choice now in exchange for a promise of lower costs in the future . The regulation of health-care providers and the mandates on all employers would be massively increased . No longer would employers and individuals be allowed to select the health-insurance coverage they prefer ; instead they would be required to buy a government-defined standard benefit package through a government-appointed monopoly purchasing agent in each region . Bureaucracy , paperwork , and waste would be increased by reduced competition , both among insurance companies and among health-care providers . The market for health care would be transformed into one giant government-managed bureaucracy . One Cheer for Al <p> PUT ME DOWN as a skeptical supporter of Al Gore 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way Washington does its business are probably desirable , at least as experiments . Skeptical because we have seen many of these proposals before , with little measurable effect . <p> The primary challenge faced by the efficiency zealots ' ( and I have been one ) is that most government waste is there for the same reason that government programs are there  --  because someone with authority supports them . Moreover , waste is often more difficult to reduce than programs because most waste is ZIP-coded . Activities that most of us regard as waste are seen as jobs , perquisites , contracts , grants , or bases by those most directly affected . Government waste is the profit ' to the politicians and bureaucrats who run the government , and thus is often guarded more zealously than the interests of those who are served by government programs or of those who pay the bills . <p> Given the magnitude of this challenge , both the goal and the actions proposed by the Vice President are surprisingly modest . The report acknowledges that The average American believes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total savings from the Gore proposals , however , are estimated to be about 1.3 per cent of the total federal expenditures now projected for the fiscal years 1994 - 2000 . A small change , even if realized . Moreover , most of these savings may be spurious . The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , in characteristic fedspeak , writes that all but $4 billion is necessary just to meet the OBRA spending caps . The REGO savings do not represent additional deficit reduction . The report also suffers from wishful thinking . Two-thirds of the estimated savings results from unspecified system ' savings . Specific agency and program level proposals account for only one-third of anticipated savings . Furthermore , at best , the savings are gross savings . The report ducks the issue of additional costs for a number of REGO proposals . ' Any savings from the Gore proposals , then , are likely to be lost in the noise . <p> One reason for the modest savings is that the Gore group seemed to have pulled their punches even when they were aimed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The report proposes to waive the prevailing wage ' requirements on federal construction contracts up to $100,000 , but not on larger contracts , where all the money is . And the report proposes to reorganize the air-traffic-control system as a government corporation , like the Postal Service , rather than as a private , user-owned corporation . All too often , the report makes a good case for some management reform and then punts . The trust deficit ' is not likely to be reduced any more than the fiscal deficit . Theory vs . Practice <p> ON OCCASION , nevertheless , it is worth while to put aside one 's hardearned skepticism to evaluate the proposed changes on their own merit . On this basis , the report deserves reading and support . Most of the text and proposals could have been written by the Reagan Administration . A broader commitment to these general themes would lead to many more suggestions for specific savings . <p> Five proposals caught my special attention : The report recommends a substantial increase in the electric-power rates charged by the federal power-marketing administrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Gore was especially protective of subsidized power , at one time summoning me to a star-chamber hearing on the charge that I had been thinking on the job about this issue . Late converts should be forgiven for their prior sins . The Administration is urged to set a goal of reducing the internal regulations affecting federal agencies by 50 per cent . The Gore report is silent , however , about the much more costly regulations affecting the private sector , except to note that the new regulatory review process will be more useful and realistic . ' Cabinet secretaries and agency heads should have the authority to grant states and localities selective waivers from federal regulations or mandates . ' How would Congress react to a request for similar authority to waive regulations affecting the private sector ? The report urges the President to issue a directive limiting the use of unfunded mandates on state and local governments . That would be valuable discipline and would shift the accountability for the remaining mandates to those political authorities that imposed the costs . A few days later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers to finance his health-care plan . Finally , the report strongly criticizes the regulations that require government agencies to purchase supplies , support services , printing , and real estate through a centralized purchasing agency . The report recommends that agencies be allowed to purchase these services from any source . The centerpiece of the proposed restructuring of health care , in contrast , is a health alliance ' that would be a monopoly purchaser of health plans in each state or region . Al , call Bill ! <p> Each of these proposals , of course , implies a double standard . That is not a sufficient basis for opposing them . Moreover , the perception of a double standard ( as with politicians and teachers who oppose school choice but send their own children to private schools ) can be a useful wedge in making the case that the private sector should not be subject to stricter standards . No Cheers for Bill <p> PUT ME DOWN as a vigorous opponent of the Clinton health plan . Most of the problems of our current health-care system are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a legacy of prior government mistakes . The plan would substantially broaden insurance coverage and then try to constrain the adverse effects via bureaucratic controls . <p> All of us would be required to buy a standard benefits package that includes some services many of us would never think of using , and most of us would never purchase insurance to cover . For others , the standard package will not include some coverage they would prefer . Any one-size-fits-all benefits package , thus , will be too large for some and too small for others . Moreover , all those in the same plan would pay the same premium , whatever their expected use of medical care , substantially reducing the financial incentive to stay healthy . Broader coverage would be financed by higher taxes and mandates on employers , which would reduce the growth of employment and wages . This plan would be a massive transfer from those who expect to make little use of the health-care system to those who would incur the highest costs , regardless of the cause of this difference , and regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projected costs of this plan are fantasy , because the indirect effects may be much larger than the direct effects . The most important relevant fact is that the current costs of Medicare and Medicaid are many times the official projections when the programs were approved . <p> The President seems to be either naive or cynical  --  naive if he believes that one can substantially increase the demand for health care without increasing prices and expenditures , cynical if he believes that he can convince Congress to approve this plan before the costs are apparent . A more immediate concern is that about half of the Senate Republicans have endorsed most of Mr. Clinton 's major provisions , a strategy best described as a pre-emptive surrender to the largest expansion in federal powers in several decades . <p> In the end , responsive and efficient government should not be our primary concern . Doing the right thing more responsively or at lower cost is a worthwhile goal and may or may not reduce expenditures . Doing the wrong thing better serves no obvious purpose . <p> Our government was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be small . On a per-dollar basis , the Federal Government now probably has less waste , for example , than during the Jackson Administration and less graft than during the Grant Administration . But waste , fraud , and abuse ' did not matter much when the federal budget took up a tiny fraction of national output . Our primary problem is that we now have a huge inefficient government . Since 1929 , for example , the federal budget 's share of gross domestic product has increased from 2.6 per cent to 24.5 per cent , and the relative cost of federal regulations has probably increased at a similar rate . Our government now defines its own powers , without even rhetorical deference to the limited powers enumerated in the Constitution . Reinventing government may well be worth while . The huge expansion of federal powers to implement the Clinton health plan , in contrast , would be a threat to our physical , economic , and political health . <p> CARTOON <p> By WILLIAM A.
