Open-door admission policies at community colleges provide access to postsecondary institutions for language-minority students ; however , open-door policies also pose dilemmas . Colleges straggle with the problem of providing open access to an increasingly diverse student population while providing quality programming that will ensure student success . Once enrolled , many linguistically diverse students face academic barriers they may be unprepared to cross . Students who lack the academic skills for success in college have challenged open-admission institutions for decades , but strategies for identifying both the causes of academic unreadiness and the solutions have become as diverse as the student body itself . As the enrollment of linguistically diverse students continues to increase at open-admissions institutions , traditional academic programs and support services are experiencing unchartered challenges . <p> Not since the turn of the century has immigration in the U.S. accounted for such diverse population growth . Although close to 90% of legalized immigrants in the mid-1980s settled in 20 states ( Allen &; Turner , 1988 ) and 70% of refugees were resettled in only 9 states , current demographics indicate all 50 states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . If current trends continue , by the year 2025 , nearly a third of the nation 's total population will have arrived since 1980 ( Ellcessor , 1994 ) . Beckham ( 1995 ) reported that among college-age populations , the minority has become the majority in Mississippi , New Mexico , California , and Texas . Thirty-six percent of Florida 's college-age population is minority , and the projection for the year 2010 in Florida is that 53% of the college-age population will be minority ( Beckham , 1995 ) . Over one-half of Hispanics attending postsecondary institutions attend community colleges ( Beckham , 1995 ) . Ascher ( 1984 , p. 1 ) reported that Hispanics tend to be less prepared for college than non-Hispanics . He speculates that the high percentage of Hispanics who enroll in vocational or general programs rather than academic programs may be one explanation . Additionally , Ascher reports that fewer Hispanics take advanced math , science , or English courses , and many do not take a standardized college entrance exam such as SAT or ACT . <p> The complexities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to U.S. culture and educational systems , further increases the likelihood that language-minority students may tend to enter community colleges less prepared for academic success than native speakers of English . Not only do open-admission institutions have a moral responsibility to ensure successful academic experiences for language-minority students , they are also legally responsible for identifying , assessing , and placing students at appropriate entry levels to ensure equal access to educational opportunities . As Cross ( 1976 , p. 3 ) cautions , " Educational opportunity means more than the right to meet minimal standards ; it means the right to develop one 's talents to maximum effectiveness . " <p> Legal issues regarding the admission of language-minority students differ . A melange of legal immigration documents exists for entry into the United States ; each document requires technical expertise for analysis . Two categorical distinctions among Limited English Proficient ( LEP ) students must be made , however , to address legal concerns germane to admission criteria : ( 1 ) internationals ( nonimmigrants ) and ( 2 ) legalized residents who are accorded citizen rights ( refugees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to here as RITs . Defining the Population : Nonimmigrant Internationals and RITs <p> International students are nonimmigrant students who have been extended a student visa ( I-20 ) from a specific institution that allows them to enter the United States for the sole purpose of pursuing academic coursework . Upon completing their studies , they must return to their country of origin . The majority of postsecondary institutions extending the I-20 privilege to international applicants require a specific score on the Test of English as a Foreign Language ( TOEFL ) as part of admissions criteria . International students usually apply from abroad , or they may transfer from English language programs within the U.S. after demonstrating an acceptable score on an English language proficiency test . <p> The legal responsibility of the accepting institution is quite clear : Institutions that choose to accept internationals must monitor their individual academic records to insure that they maintain their student status as required by the Office of Immigration and Naturalization Services ( INS ) . In contrast to the legal rights of RITs as citizens , there is no legal obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elect to do so for a variety of reasons that are perceived to benefit the educational environment for all students , limited English proficient internationals are not usually admitted . Alternatively , admission barriers for these students may not be permanent . Many universities offer self-supporting English language programs throughout the U.S. and in other parts of the world . Although participation in these programs does not include admission into the college or university itself , it does provide language instruction that can assist internationals in passing English language admission requirements . Refugees , Immigrants , and Territorials ( RITs ) <p> Unlike internationals , RITs have the same legal access to post-secondary education as do native English-speaking students born in the United States . They may be recent graduates from local high schools or from U.S. territories such as Guam or Puerto Rico . Frequently they are naturalized citizens . The provision for educational opportunities and appropriate instruction for this group must be similar to those for native speakers of English . <p> Institutions with selective admissions , however , are not legally obligated to admit RITs who are limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEP students can not meet entry-score requirements on the language portion of standardized admissions tests required of all applicants . Moreover , few RITs are able to participate in the intensive English language programs offered at universities . Both the cost and the intensive hours of instruction per week prohibit attendance . RIT student profiles are similar to native-born community college students . In other words , their financial needs require employment ; in most cases they are employed full-time . Likewise , family obligations , health problems , and economic difficulties germane to new immigrants create further barriers to full-time intensive study . The legal obligation to provide English language instruction for RITs , therefore , falls predominantly upon community colleges . <p> Access to postsecondary education for the growing U.S. population of LEP adults depends upon access to quality English as a second language ( ESL ) programming at open-admissions public institutions . Standard procedures are needed for admitting , assessing , and placing these students ( according to their skill levels ) in courses that will provide appropriate instruction . Procedures used must be flexible enough to accommodate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or developmental courses designed for underprepared native English speakers , with no provision for the very different instructional needs of LEP students , could conceivably be challenged in court . A review of the court cases related to language-minority students lends credence to the development of viable and systematic admission and placement procedures . Legal Issues <p> A considerable body of federal law has developed over the past 25 years addressing the educational rights of language-minority students . The enactment of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 initiated legal obligations in schools with LEP student populations . Title VI provides that students can not be excluded from participation in , denied the benefits of , or subjected to discrimination in educational programs or activities on the basis of race , color , or national origin . In 1968 , the Department of Health , Education and Welfare published guidelines stating that " school systems are responsible for assuring that students of a particular race , color , or national origin are not denied the opportunity to obtain the education generally obtained by other students in the system " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In the Lau v. Nichols case ( 1974 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Office for Civil Rights Memorandum . Its purpose was to clarify Title VI requirements concerning the responsibility of school districts to provide equal education opportunity to language-minority students . In the Lau v. Nichols suit , brought on behalf of LEP students of Chinese ancestry in the San Francisco public school system , the court ruled that providing LEP students with the same standards , curriculum , facilities , and textbooks as native English speaking students is not equality . This ruling initiated guidelines for developing ESL instruction as well as for identifying LEP students in public school systems across the country . Additionally , the Equal Education Opportunities Act of 1974 established new instructional statutory requirements for public school districts serving language-minority students ( Markus , 1995 ) . <p> Markus ( 1995 ) also pointed out that although Lau v. Nichols guidelines were never promulgated as formal regulations , they served as a basis for the U.S. Office for Civil Rights ( OCR ) enforcement activities . They have also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education Opportunity Act ( EEOA ) cases . In December 1985 , OCR issued a document entitled " The Office for Civil Rights ' Title VI Language Minority Compliance Procedures , " which outlines OCR policy with regard to the education of language-minority students and Title VI compliance standards ( Office for Civil Rights , 1985 ) . In 1991 , OCR issued an update to this document entitled " Policy Update on Schools ' Obligations Toward National Origin Minority Students with Limited English Proficiency ( LEP students ) " ( Office for Civil Rights , 1991 ) . <p> The Constitution does not expressly provide students with a fight to a public education ; however , the Court , in Plyler v. Doe ( 457 U.S. 202 , 1982 ) , held education to be a semi-fundamental right . In this case , the Supreme Court ruled that public schools were prohibited from denying immigrant students access to a public education from kindergarten through grade 12 on the basis of their immigration status . Furthermore , states and public schools are prohibited from enacting or adopting laws , regulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fight to attend free public primary and secondary schools like their U.S. citizen and permanent resident counterparts ( Carrera , 1995 , p. 1 ) . Because public community colleges receive state funding for their academic programs , court rulings may be implied at postsecondary institutions as well . To date , community colleges have not been challenged in court ; however , with the increasing number of language-minority students seeking access to postsecondary institutions , the Supreme Court has held that once a state undertakes to provide educational opportunities , these become a fight that must be made available to all students on equal terms ( Carrera , 1995 , p. 3 ) . <p> The well-publicized Welfare Bill recently signed by President Clinton may jeopardize access to higher education for LEP immigrants ( Aron , 1996 ) . As part of welfare reform efforts supported by Republicans and Democrats in both the Senate and House versions of this bill , a section not well-publicized bars some legal resident aliens from participating in social programs that include student grants and loans . An aspect of the billed called deeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident aliens ' own income , the income of their sponsors , and the income of their sponsors ' spouses . The impact upon the majority of legal immigrants will inflate their actual income , thus denying them benefits for financial aid , particularly Pell Grants , that their own tax dollars support . The outcome for enrollment in postsecondary institutions across the country is predictable . Miami-Dade Community College alone reports that more than 8,000 students could be subject to deeming and thereby lose their financial aid . The California Community College System could loose financial aid for more than 34,800 students . This bill may be incongruous with enforcement of other civil rights legislation . <p> The Department of Education 's Office for Civil Rights ( OCR ) has the responsibility for enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race , color , or national origin in programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance . Not only do community colleges receive state funding for academic programs , but they also receive federal funds in the forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are obliged to comply with federal regulations or they risk losing federal financial assistance . Procedures outlined by OCR ( Office for Civil Rights , 1992 , p. 6 ) to ensure that educational programs are serving LEP students effectively include the following requirements : identify students who need assistance ; develop a program that , in the view of professional educators , has a reasonable chance for success ; ensure that needed staff , curricular materials , and facilities are in place and used properly ; develop appropriate evaluative standards for measuring the progress of students , including program exit criteria ; and continue program assessment and modification where needed . <p> A decision to admit RITs based on achievement tests normed for native language speakers is a questionable practice . Many court cases have been based on the charge that tests have caused the disproportionate placement of minority students in lower ability tracks ( Edington &; Koehler , 1985 , p. 1 ) . The cases are usually based on the argument that tests are biased against the lower scoring group and students are denied access to certain programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been upheld in Hobson v. Hansen , 1967 , ( cited in Edington &; Koehler , 1985 , p. 1 ) , where it was determined that IQ tests used to track students were racially and culturally biased because they were standardized on a white , middle-class sample . The use of achievement tests instead of IQ tests may not be any more appropriate . In Moses v. Washington Parish School Board , 1971 ( cited in Edington &; Koehler , 1985 , p. 2 ) , the courts ruled against the use of achievement tests for tracking students . Legal precedents clearly demonstrate the need to admit and properly assess language minority students ; however , the task is very complex . <p> A review of the procedures used at the 28 community colleges in Florida , one of the first studies of its kind on a statewide basis , indicates issues and concerns relative to LEP students experienced by these institutions that are in line with those reported by Roueche ( 1987 ) at open-admission colleges in other states . Procedures Used by Florida Community Colleges <p> The State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructional programs on a five-year cycle . Responding to the recommendations of two prior state reviews , initial data collection for the first English as a Second Language ( ESL ) program study was conducted in 1994 . The concerns addressed in this review were as follows : ( a ) growing numbers of limited English proficient ( LEP ) students , ( b ) defining levels of ESL courses and subsequent course content , ( c ) consistency in course numbering once appropriate levels have been determined , ( d ) lack of appropriately qualified ESL instructors , ( e ) perceived lack of administrative support , and ( f ) inadequate availability of placement instruments for the target population . A questionnaire containing 147 items divided into 12 sections was distributed by the state 's Division of Community Colleges . Three primary areas of concern were included : identification , assessment , and placement , with additional questions regarding background information , curricula , exit tests , articulation , faculty perceptions , instruction , and miscellaneous . The questionnaire was addressed to the 28 community college presidents within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinator . The majority of the respondents ( 29% ) indicated their titles as academic dean or chair . Two southern counties , Dade and Broward , reported the highest enrollment of LEPs . Although 4 colleges ( 14% ) reported that the enrollment figures were not available , 24 ( 86% ) reported enrollment of language-minority students . Identification Procedures for LEPs <p> The second section of the survey addressed identification procedures for LEPs . A majority of the respondents indicated that more than one person was involved in the identification procedure . The persons primarily responsible for establishing the criteria for identifying immigrant , refugee , entrant and citizen students ( IRECs ) were admissions officers ( 34% ) , ESL personnel ( 19% ) , boards of trustees ( 15% ) , and counselors and advisors ( 15% ) , including foreign student advisors ( 11% ) . ( The questionnaire used the term IRECs to refer to the same target population as that referred to as RITs in this article . ) Only two colleges reported that they had no method for identifying IRECs who may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported a current procedural plan under development . Although application forms were mentioned most frequently for the identification of LEPs , additional methods used included assessment , referrals , counselor and advisor interviews , and classroom grades . <p> The responses indicated that 14 colleges ( 50% ) were experiencing problems with their identification procedures . Four colleges reported problems with LEP students inappropriately placed due to self-identification procedures where students chose not to identify themselves as language-minority students . Further summative comments indicated that the problems they were experiencing with the identification of LEPs were directly related to their assessment procedures . Assessment Procedures <p> A variety of criteria for pre-admission assessment procedures were reported by the community colleges . In addition to requiring high school diplomas , two-thirds of the colleges reported a required English language proficiency score for admitting international students ( nonimmigrant students ) , and one-third required an English score for admitting immigrant-residents . The most frequently used language assessment instrument for internationals was the Test of English as a Foreign Language ( TOEFL ) . Although this requirement is appropriate for internationals , a policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several reasons . First , a fee is charged , and scores are delayed because applicants are required to register through Educational Testing Services . Second , the TOEFL is administered exclusively on pre-established annual dates . Third , the TOEFL is designed to assess English language proficiency ; it is not intended to be a placement instrument for open-admissions institutions as it does not discriminate skill levels sufficiently . <p> The procedure for undertaking any program review conducted by the Florida Division of Community Colleges includes preliminary conversations with selected faculty and administrators representative of all institutions throughout the state . These representatives discuss issues germane to the program ( discipline ) to be studied and offer suggestions for the development and revision of the survey instrument to be used for data collection . These preliminary conversations revealed problems relative to the transfer of students from one ESL program to another within the state community college system , even though the state uses a common course numbering system . Many reported that the level of English language proficiency was difficult to interpret based upon the letter grade of any given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the Florida Department of Education statewide course numbering system . The responses indicated that community colleges differed greatly in the number of levels taught as well as the range of competencies taught within each course . Other problems cited in the admissions procedures included insufficient number of staff to assess LEP needs ; inconsistency among and between campuses relative to the procedures ; inadequate counselor and advisor availability and training ; and the inadequate availability of appropriate placement testing instruments , particularly for assessing composition designed specifically for language-minority students . Placement Procedures <p> The respondents were asked to identify personnel responsible for determining placement of LEP students . The majority of the respondents indicated that more than one person was involved in determining placement for LEP students . The most frequently mentioned category for placement decisions was non-ESL personnel . Among institutions reporting that counselors and advisors determined placement , it was difficult in some instances to ascertain whether counselors and advisors actually made the determination of placement or followed a criteria established by the other categories , such as non-ESL administration , ESL administration , ESL faculty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Table 1 . <p> Florida public institutions are required to administer basic skills assessment for all entering students that is normed on native English speakers ; however , some of the institutions reported that this mandated assessment instrument was not administered until after students had been identified as LEP and after they had received ESL coursework as described in section ( 8 ) of the Florida State Board of Education Administrative Rules , which states the following : " Students whose first language is not English may be placed in college preparatory instruction prior to the testing required herein if such instruction is otherwise demonstrated as being necessary . Such students shall not be exempted from the testing required herein " ( Florida State Board of Education Administrative Rules , 6A-10.0315 ) . <p> This ruling allows individual institutions to select and use English language placement instruments designed exclusively for non-native speakers followed by ESL course placement before administering the state-adopted testing requirements for all entering students . Based upon some questionnaire responses , however , this section of the administrative rules did not appear to be uniformly interpreted across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of testing instruments normed on native speakers for all entering students added commentary , " as required by the state . " <p> Twenty-six institutions reported that they used an English language proficiency exam after admission . The number of community colleges that use English tests after students are admitted are reported in Table 2 . Furthermore , 16 institutions ( 57% ) reported that language minority students were placed in college preparatory classes designed for native speakers . In many instances , this was reported as inappropriate and in lieu of ESL instruction . Apparently , some direct placement of LEP students into college preparatory classes resulted from individual instances of unidentified LEP student problems , various flaws in the system , or both as reported by individual institutions . Eighteen institutions reported offering at least one ESL course . Of the 14 that reported the year that they first offered these courses , 8 were offering ESL courses in the 1980s . The criteria for placing LEP students in ESL courses is reported in Table 3 . <p> On the other hand , ESL placement was not necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place directly into college-prep or college-credit English classes for native speakers . This was the intent of Section ( 8 ) of the Florida State Board of Education Rules relative to provisions for students whose first language is not English . An additional issue addressed whether or not ESL courses were required of degree-seeking LEP students . The responses indicated that 7 community colleges required ESL courses , while 17 indicated that ESL courses were not required . This issue is not unlike remedial course requirements for underprepared native speakers in the 1970s when remedial skill courses were recommended but not required . <p> The most frequently used instrument for placement of LEP students was an ESL test . The ESL tests mentioned were in-house instruments designed within a specific institution , pre-TOEFL , an essay or writing sample holistically scored based on criteria developed within specific institutions , Basic English Skills Test ( BEST ) , Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency ( MTELP ) , Comprehensive English Language Test ( CELT ) , and the LOEP ( Levels of English Proficiency ) . The responses are reported below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 57% ) reported that they administered an essay or writing sample . The persons primarily responsible for creating ESL placement essay topics were ESL faculty followed by English faculty members . Eleven institutions reported that they used a holistic scoring procedure to place RIT students . <p> Colleges indicating low enrollments of LEP students reported that the ability to offer a sufficient range of ESL coursework to ensure academic success was problematic . Among the 10 community colleges indicating that they did not offer any ESL courses , some of these colleges had identified LEP students . Recommendations <p> A draft copy of the study was disseminated to each of the 28 community colleges . After feedback was received , the following recommendations were presented by the Florida Division of Community Colleges ( FDCC ) and accepted by the Florida State Board of Community Colleges in September 1996 : A statewide task force should be formed to examine a selection of appropriate language assessment instruments and standards of quality regarding curriculum , student performance , and faculty development for the purpose of insuring continued access and success for LEP students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within ESL college preparatory courses should be addressed as unique and separate from those of native speakers in college preparatory courses as defined in 240.117 ( F.S. ) . High school students whose primary language is not English should be offered the opportunity to take language assessment tests specifically designed for non-native speakers by the tenth grade to identify further ESL instructional needs prior to entering postsecondary institutions . The Division of Community Colleges and the Division of Public Schools should appoint a committee to develop articulation efforts relative to curriculum in ESOL high school courses and ESL/ENS college prep and college credit courses . State accountability data should be analyzed to study the success of ESL and ENS students in credit course work , associate 's degree graduation , and the state university system . Colleges should conduct local studies to determine ESL funding generation , to assess the unmet needs of this population , and to generate a plan that would address strategies for instructional development , staff training , lab instructional support , and needed materials , equipment , or other services . The State Board of Community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the results of the local studies , to fund appropriate statewide training for ESL employees and for other projects that may emerge from the study that could be shown to be of statewide benefit for ESL students . <p> Final copies of the study are being disseminated across the state , and plans are currently being developed at the FDCC for implementing the recommendations . Procedural Reform for Language Minority Students <p> The Commission to Improve Minority Education was formed in 1990 by the American Association of Community Colleges to address the problems of language-minority students seeking access to the nation 's two year colleges . The Commission focused on the following challenges : Improving recruitment , retention , and academic success rates for African American , Hispanic , American Indian , and Asian/ Pacific Islander students in community colleges . Increasing the number of staff from these ethnic groups to serve in professional positions at community colleges . Increasing the number of students from these ethnic groups who transfer to four-year colleges or attain employment in fields that require technical or specialized training . Improving campus climate . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate crimes on community college campuses . ( Commission to Improve Minority Education , 1993 , p. 1 ) <p> How then do we address the issues of accessibility and quality ? Nielsen ( 1991 , p. 48 ) stresses the importance of assessment programs that identify student capabilities so that students can be placed at their appropriate entry levels . Other suggestions by Nielsen ( 1991 , p. 8 ) include faculty development programs that help faculty work more effectively with students and model institutional programs to meet the needs of the underprepared student . Ellis ( 1995 , pp. 31-32 ) proposes three recommendations for new program development : Develop heuristic evaluation models that promote continuous and responsive curriculum refinement ; provide adequate support service for ESL students that include access to all programs and services of the college at a point when LEP students can benefit ; and use a consultant experienced with community and technical college ESL programming when developing a new program . <p> A study conducted by the Resource Center for Language Minority Students , which is funded by the New Jersey Department of Higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of higher education in states with large LEP enrollments to determine the assessment instruments used for exiting ESL students into mainstream courses ( Aron , 1994 , p. 2 ) . The majority of the respondents indicated that inhouse exit testing was used due to a perceived lack of appropriate standardized tests designed for **27;591;TOOLONG students . Aron speculated that the reason why standardized ESL exit tests were not widely reported is because college-level programs serve very diverse needs and constituencies . No one common test could serve such a range of program types ( Aron , 1994 ) . Future Challenges <p> One of the major challenges facing community colleges is implementing viable identification procedures and developing appropriate curriculum for this diverse student population . Rodriquez ( 1993 , p. 7 ) reported that minimal tracking of ESL students exists ; few are reported as earning associate 's degrees , and even fewer are reported as transferring to four-year institutions . When proper procedures and programming are not in place , the open door becomes the revolving door for most limited English proficient students across the nation . Future environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students may look in two incongruous directions : ( a ) exemplary ESL programs with both measurable accountability and viable tracking data into associate-degree programs , and ( b ) potential court challenges from individual and group representatives of LEP students who have been essentially denied access to postsecondary education as a result of the unavailability of appropriate English language instruction .
