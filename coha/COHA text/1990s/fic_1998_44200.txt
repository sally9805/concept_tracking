MY OWN FATHER DID NOT MATCH UP to his father and grandfather . But he was quite someone . He kept his father 's lands and some of his decorations . Upon his return from the Syrian campaign , he was offered a red burnoose and was appointed Caid.1 He was the only native landowner amongst the colonists . <p> - Son , he told me , the Boularouah family has its place in the sun , it shines with honors and riches , but it will always be remiss as long as it has not possessed science , the knowledge of religious law , grammar and other subjects . Son , let 's add science to honors and riches . Our name shines to the stars , but there is still a jewel missing in our crown . Go to Tunis and come back laden with awards ; come back bedecked with royal dignity and I 'll guarantee you the position of cadhi2 in Constantine . I noticed one thing : those who are versed in French knowledge do not distinguish themselves for they will never , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to acquire a knowledge that is not available to your brethren , they will bow to you ; the French themselves will have to call on you to seat their power . Then all the hopes will be within your grasp . Your oldest brother will make a career in the army ; you will go seek knowledge at the Zitouna University . <p> They married me before my departure for Tunis . I was fifteen , she was nine . Horse riders rushed to the wedding from everywhere ; musicians and dancers were brought in , sheep were slaughtered , feasts were organized . I was dressed in a silk burnoose ; they put varnished shoes on my feet . In the evening , a procession led me to her . <p> When they explained to me what I was supposed to do , I did n't want to hear it . I started crying ; she in her turn started sobbing . Our lamentations which grew louder alerted my father who entered the room , a cane in his hand . He whipped both of us and forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst into cries of joy . <p> A week later , my father told me : " Let 's go ! " The suitcases were ready . We spent one night in Constantine and another in Souk-Ahras . There he entrusted me to one of his acquaintances and headed back home . <p> During the summer vacation I returned to find Aisha , my wife , dead . <p> I mourned her deeply . I did n't have any marital relation with her , which still remained a mystery to me , but that did not prevent me from shedding tears on her : I could still see her sleeping beside me , tucking me in , playing with me , lamenting her parents . <p> I was told she had died . <p> But the youngest of my father 's wives made me a terrible revelation . <p> - Your father killed her , he strangled her . Shunning his four wives , it was she he asked to wash his feet . He closed the door behind them . The next morning , we found her dead . Her robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her neck bore finger marks . We mourned her and buried her without washing her corpse . . . According to your father she was too young to be stained by shame . <p> The youngest of my father 's wives was sixteen . She made me advances , but I staunchly resisted them . At the end , I gave in . <p> We learned about my oldest brother 's death . I felt no sorrow . His wife died the same death as Aisha . <p> . . . My father was discovered dead , murdered in Constantine . His body , riddled with wounds , was tossed over a bridge into the abyss . <p> Three months passed and Hanifa , the youngest of my father 's wives , died the same death as Aisha and my sister-in-law . She behaved with me like a wife : full of delicate attention , she would always take my side , blushed in my presence ; she managed to meet whichever place I happened to be in the house . <p> My father 's third wife played the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was me who got angry she would calm me down ; she would dress and perfume Hanifa ; each time she met me she spoke to me about Hanifa . <p> One night , my mother knocked on my chamber door . Hanifa got up and went to open it . At that moment my mother recited the phrase : " God , you whose goodness and leniency are immeasurable , be my refuge against Satan . " Then she said to Hanifa " Tell him that someone is asking for him . " Hanifa came back to inform me . I looked her straight in the face . Lava drowned my heart , the flood rose up to my eyes ; my mouth burst into flames and the flow irradiated . <p> I saw Aisha , her bruised neck , the marks of fingers . I saw again my sister-in-law . <p> I could not see anymore , the lava overflowed and a flood , now rushing from the outside , submerged me . <p> I threw myself on her . Disconcerted , she offered no resistance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her neck . <p> We buried her . After eight days , my mother breathed her last sigh . . . <p> A week later , my father 's second wife took to her heels . Seven days passed , and we buried the third wife . <p> I left the countryside to live in Constantine where I joined the Reformists.3 <p> My second wife ! That one wanted me at all costs to give her a child . Her mother and all her family insisted with her . She was patient for a year , two , three , four years . At the start of the fifth year she announced that something was stirring in her belly . I was overwhelmed with joy . But , a week later , she disappeared and one day I learned that she had gone to France with her cousin , the true father of the child . <p> I returned to the country . <p> It was love at first sight with the pretty wife of a khammas.4 I had her come in with her daughter and locked both up . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then one day he came to see me . <p> - Good evening , Sidi Sheikh . <p> - Good evening to you . <p> -I wanted to tell you . . . <p> - What did you want to tell me ? Are you starving ? <p> - No , sir . <p> - Are you in need of something ? <p> - No . <p> - Have you suffered an injustice ? <p> - No . <p> - Then what ? What is it that you wanted to tell me ? <p> -I wanted to tell that people . . . <p> - What 's the matter with these people ? <p> - They 're talking . <p> - Do you believe that I can prevent someone from talking ? <p> -I mean . . . <p> - What do you mean ? Go away , I saw enough of you ! <p> The khammas walked away with a heavy step . Before making the corner around the stable he looked back fixedly in my direction . He hung around me for several days more , looking embarrassed . Finally he approached me again . <p> - Good evening , Sidi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ! <p> - Yes , it 's me again . <p> - What do you want ? <p> - People are talking . <p> - What are they saying ? <p> - They say I am a pimp . <p> - And what harm does it do you ? <p> - To tell you the truth , Sidi Sheikh , I am ashamed to appear before you . My grandfather worked for your grandfather ; my father was at the employ of your father . Your late mother had a lot of affection for me ; it was she who paid for my wedding . <p> - You have the choice between two options : either you leave for France or I 'll have you sent to Cayenne . <p> - Take the child but let the mother come back . <p> - Either you leave for France or you disappear . <p> - At your orders , Sidi Sheikh . <p> The next day I had him embarked on ship to Marseille . <p> I waited for the wife of the khammas to become pregnant . She too was waiting . <p> Months passed . One night , the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . <p> The brasero burst in flames around me . Lava infiltrated my chest . The flood overflowed and submerged me . I saw Aisha , my sister-inlaw , Hanifa . My gaze blurred and I was plunged into darkness . <p> In the morning , the wife of the khammas , who had turned blue , had finger marks on her neck . We buried her . <p> I returned to Constantine with the child who was the same age as Aisha . I read the Fatiha and got in the habit of feeling her belly . Each time she complained about being sick , I would rush to feel her belly . <p> One year passed by then another . The child had grown ; she came to understand why I was feeling her belly . She would occasionally refrain from coming to the house and would enquire about my travel schedule . <p> One day , I told her : " Tomorrow , I go on a trip . " A flash of joy illuminated her face . <p> The next day I grabbed my suitcase and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came back home . <p> My return surprised her . She blushed then turned pale ; her lips twitched , her knees trembled . I stared at her : she lowered her eyes and started crying . <p> - What did you do ? <p> - Nothing . <p> - What were you about to do ? <p> I lifted her chin . <p> - Look at me , raise your eyes towards me . <p> She raised her eyes then lowered them again . I found her beautiful . I was sensitive to the color of her cheeks , the brightness of her eyes , the crimson of her lips . I drew her by the chin towards me and she offered no resistance . I leaned to kiss her on the lips , I embraced her and hugged her tight against me . <p> -I am gon na give it to you . I know you 've been waiting for it impatiently . I am all yours , yours . I have n't done anything before now . <p> She kept saying the same thing as her pretty eyes were shedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . <p> A week later I buried her and returned to the city . <p> I swore never to marry again . Yet , not knowing why , at the end of seven months , I began to tire of loneliness . <p> At night , the dark mist would shroud my heart . In my chest would slumber a field of lava . The heat would engulf me and the lava would begin to flow and submerge me . It was no good my trying to give light , I could n't see anything anymore ; I would grope around like a blind man . <p> My servants told me that they heard me shout at night the name of Aisha , but I could only remember the darkness where I was plunged , the bubbling , the overflowing lava , the sensation of being blind , the painful gropings around . <p> I would cogitate : marry seven women all at once , each accompanied by a eunuch . <p> I would cogitate : marry twenty women and couple each of them with seven men . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cogitate : change to a woman , marry a million men , give birth to a million children . <p> I would cogitate : dig an immense well , as deep as the gorges of the Rhummel , throw in it one thousand women , one thousand children , one thousand fathers , one thousand mothers , rivers of milk . <p> What I cogitated about never materialized . I simply got married to two women at the same time . Down deep , I would sometimes tell myself : this one is power , that one knowledge . Or : this one is Arabism , that one Berberism . Or still : this one is Islam , that one Christianity . <p> I could not look at them without thinking of two opposites . I felt very strong , I was king , I bore on my head the crown that my father was talking about ... <p> I would beat both of them together , kiss both of them together , bed both of them at the same time , ask both of them the same question : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awoke one morning , they were nowhere to be found . A few days later , the Cadhi handed me two petitions to forfeit my marital authority . <p> I was again alone , master of my land , my head crammed with law and grammar , climbing an endless slope , going up and down relentlessly . Each time I examined the situation , I always found myself in the same predicament : ever more decrepit , like the rock of Constantine which is about to burst and disintegrate . Around me , the precipice was getting deeper and deeper , the dark waters continued their sap digging . <p> I got acquainted with a Jewish woman . <p> - You are barren , and so am I , she told me . Let 's get married and adopt a child . <p> We got married . <p> She took perfect care of me , changed my life , improved my lot . She paid for all the expenses of the trip we took to France . She was rich . The best of wives ! With her I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least . <p> Our quarrels began the day we thought about adopting a child . <p> - We will adopt a Jew . <p> - No , a Moslem . <p> -A Jew . I am the one who holds the purse . <p> -A Moslem . With my riches , I am worth more than you and your money . <p> - We 'll adopt two : a Moslem girl and a Jewish boy . <p> -A Moslem boy and a Jewish girl . <p> -A Moslem boy and a Jewish boy . <p> -I ca n't have a Jewish male in my house . <p> - Racist and fanatic ! <p> - Racist yourself . <p> - No , yourself . <p> I slapped her on the face . She slapped me back and went out . She left the house and repudiated me . I was crazy , she , too . I was driven by an inexplicable jingoism . By losing her , I lost my wealth , I interrupted an interesting experiment . <p> -I miss you Sara , I mourn your loss . <p> I mourn the child that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian or Muslim , who cares ? I mourn both of you , yes both , from the bottom of my heart . <p> ... <p> Loneliness became unbearable , but not for long . It was , however , difficult for me to marry a little girl or even a young virgin ; I was left with deflowered women . <p> I at last escaped from Aisha . She was my wife , and I never bedded her ; she was my sister , and we never sucked from the same breast ; she was my daughter , and she was not from my blood . <p> It was during a trip to Biskra that I encountered her . . . . . <p> Translated from Marcel Blois 's French version by Hedi Abdel-Jaouad <p> Footnote
