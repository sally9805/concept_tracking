WHEN WE THINK OF LIFE ISSUES , we too often think of them as specific moments in time : the moment of conception , the moment of birth , the moment of death . Even when we discuss such issues as artificial contraception , abortion and euthanasia ethically , we do the same . What often gets lost in this way of thinking is that life is not a single moment in time , but a long continuum of moments . We are conceived and born , nourished and nurtured over an extensive period . This nurturing is not often thought of as part of the ethical realm . We take it for granted or we cover it with such broad strokes ( husbands , love your wives ; children , obey your parents ) that there is little practical content showing us how to do it well . Yet it is this very nurturing that forms the crux of a consistent ethic of life . We learn to respect life by having been nurtured into this respect . Ethicians often regard the moral agent as an autonomous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an independent person isolated from other moral agents at the moment of ethical decision-making . The individual reflects on the moral law and then determines what to do . A Catholic needs to know , for example , what the moral law teaches about artificial contraception , abortion , euthanasia and then determines to follow this teaching . If the norm is correct and the agent applies the norm properly , then right acts follow and life is preserved . I wish to suggest , however , that following these guidelines is not enough to sustain life . To sustain life actively we need to be connected to others ; we need to have ongoing relationships . Our need is not just to be tolerated but to be cared for . Likewise , we need to care for others . Sustaining life involves webs of relationship . Otherwise , sustaining life is reducible to being hooked up to a machine with little or no personal interaction . The consistent ethic of life should not revolve around issues but around a consistent nurturing of others . This would include not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion and euthanasia , but the very mundane activities of daily care . We need to ask ourselves if we are life-givers in our day-to-day activities . When we view life as a continuation of nurturing moments by people in relationship , we soon see that there is no more central place where we learn to sustain life than in the family . We are all born into a family and it is there that we first learn what it means to be cared for . It is there that we learn that life has value and that we are valuable . It is there that we first learn how to interact with others and to grow in relationship . Families teach us much about nurturing life , and though each family is unique , we soon realize that there are certain common virtues that are present in life-sustaining families . Three of the most important of these virtues are faithfulness , courage and prudence . Faithfulness . There is probably no virtue more important for sustaining life than faithfulness . As married couples we are called not only to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any children with whom we might be gifted . To do this as well as possible we need to be faithful to each other and to our children . Faithfulness involves a commitment to someone other than ourselves . We find repeated instances in the Old Testament of how God was faithful to his people and in the New Testament or how this faithfulness extended to all people . Faithfulness is necessary for the development of trust . It is because others are faithful to us that we can trust that they will remain with us as we explore who we are called to be . As children develop they need the sense of security that , as so much changes around them and as they themselves change , there is a steadfastness , a continuum , a presence that is always there for them . We all need to know that someone loves us and will always be there for us even during those times when we may not even love ourselves . The nourishment of life depends on knowing that others are there for us . As children our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow and are capable of taking care of our own physical needs , we still need others with whom we can share our sorrows and joys . Being human means being interdependent . There are times when we are dependent on others , and there are times when others are dependent on us . Faithfulness is the virtue that assures us we will be there for each other , not just when we feel like it but all the time . This is hard work . We remain with each other not just in moments of joy but during difficult times as well , since faithfulness is not based on feeling but commitment . As our children grow and begin to push us away , there are days when we know that there is nothing we can do for them except to be there should they need us . This is just as life-giving as actually giving birth . Life demands a daily commitment of presence . Not only did God bring the Israelites out of Egypt ; God fed them and remained by their side throughout the journey . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Egypt . The virtue of faithfulness is central for a consistent ethic of life . It is not sufficient to condemn certain acts as being against life . ( Are we truly life-givers if we give birth and then do not care for our child ? ) It is imperative that we nourish life , and to do this we must recognize the importance of faithfulness , since nourishment involves a commitment of time . A critical need in modern society is to develop creative modes of faithfulness . We live in a world where change is constant and rapid . Our materials are disposable , our computers are rapidly outdated , our entertainment revolves around sound bites , our meals are " fast food , " our communications are instantaneous . Even our relationships are oftentimes interchangeable . The majority of our children no longer live in a world where they come home from school and find a mother waiting with milk and cookies . In many homes there is no longer a family dinner . Frequently days may go by where children do not see one or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to the " good old days " ; but if these past symbols of faithfulness and presence from our childhood have been lost , what has replaced them ? What rituals have we established to let our children and each other know that someone is there for them ? These symbols are necessary not just on a personal level but on a societal level as well . Too easily do we condemn acts of abortion , for example , when we have few structures and practices in place to help women once they have given birth to their children . We need to ask ourselves how we as a society are faithful not just to fetuses but to pregnant women , new mothers , the handicapped , the sick , the dying  --  to each other . How can we best express faithfulness in 1995 ? Courage . Many times when we think of courage we think of people doing exceptional deeds . If we examine William Bennett 's The Book of Virtues we find under the heading courage the stories of David and Goliath , Ulysses and the Cyclops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa Parks , Harriet Tubman , Susan B. Anthony and fairy tales such as Hansel and Gretel and Jack and the Beanstalk . Bennett defines courage as the settled disposition to feel appropriate degrees of fear and confidence in challenging situations . Many of us would include people such as Gandhi , Martin Luther King Jr . and Mother Teresa in our lists of the courageous . Yet with a little more thought we would probably eventually include our parents . We have all seen up close the sacrifices our parents made for us , and we know , though we may not dwell on it , that we make many sacrifices for our children . And we do it without any certitude about what will follow . We act solely on our children 's behalf , and not because we know if we act in a specific way a certain result will follow . We do our best for our children , never knowing for sure if it is enough or if we are doing it correctly . This , I want to suggest , is also courage  --  constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end result , but resolving you will always be there for the other regardless of the pain and suffering involved . Commitment to another requires courage . If we reflect on parenting , we see how from the very beginning courage is an integral part . When we were pregnant we felt our baby gradually overtake our bodies never knowing for sure what to expect  --  wonderment upon feeling that first kick , amazement watching our bodies expand , utter astonishment at the birth process . How could something so large come out of our bodies ? Then there was the fear of many new fathers about providing for their families . Would they be able to meet the financial needs necessary to maintain a family ? How does the arrival of this newborn affect their relationship with their wives ? When our babies cried , we would feed them , change them , hold them , rock them until eventually they fell asleep , yet often we did not know for sure why they were crying . This is courage  --  caring without certitude . For many , parental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can no longer protect them from the many forces that we know might destroy them not only physically , but morally as well . How often we lie awake at night waiting for our children 's safe return . Our children live in an age where they are exposed to a host of decisions that we never had to make . They are surrounded by a society that does not give pre-marital sex a second thought . They can obtain abortions without our knowledge . They live amid the threat of AIDS . In some cases , they see people shot before their very eyes . Drugs , alcohol , gambling are easily accessible to them . As a result our children need to be wiser than we needed to be at their age . Yet as their parents we know we can not totally protect them from the many dangers that they will encounter . They grow and age and we must let them go . This is the ultimate act of courage . Parenting is courageous activity from start to finish . It begins in uncertainty , demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in letting others go , hoping they will some day return to us . Parenting , more than any other activity , teaches us that sustaining life requires courage . Prudence . The type of knowledge that parents use is a form of practical reasoning that does not offer the absolute certitude we have been trained to expect from decisions that have to do with life issues . As to acting morally , we have often been given lists of acts that we were told should never be done . We have , however , frequently been given little guidance about what we should do to become better decision-makers ourselves . If we followed the rules , we were able to feel fairly certain that we had acted rightly . For instance , if we did not use artificial contraception , did not abort , did not actively kill our terminally ill family members , we could be fairly certain we were life-sustainers . What parenting teaches us is that in most cases we are not completely certain as to what we should do . St. Thomas Aquinas says that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions , we are only able to reach practical truth , not absolute truth . Practical truth is superior to opinion but is not the same as the truth we would arrive at in a science . Parenting confirms this . There is no rigid code of parenting , since parenting is not a science . Good parenting evolves and is learned by experience . When we have our first child we are frightened and unaware of how to care for a child . We may have some knowledge because we have been around children , but the actual day-to-day caring of our own child is a totally new responsibility . We learn how to care for our child by actually doing it . As a result of doing this activity we gain a kind of knowledge that helps us to act better in the future , but this skill takes time and experience to develop . Most of us would probably agree that we were more competent parents with our last child than with our first . And this was through no fault of our own . It was simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . Parental knowledge is not just a knowledge of the head , but a knowledge of the heart as well . It is a reasoning that is driven by love and searches for the good of another . It deals with uncertainty and contingency , since in our search for the good of our children there are many ways to proceed . The good is changeable and we are never sure we have chosen the best . Parental knowledge is cut-and-paste . We are constantly adjusting our parenting skills to meet our children 's needs . How often our older children say to us when we are dealing with our younger child , " You would never have allowed me to do that . " And they 're right . It is not just that we 're older and more tired than when we were dealing with our younger child ; we have also learned a great deal about how to parent . Parenting is a skill , not a science . The answers are not known in advance but evolve as we are doing the activity . Flexibility is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the situation unfolds . There are no pat answers but many directions we could take . It therefore takes a certain skill to assess the situation properly and act appropriately . Thomas Aquinas called this skill prudence , which he regarded as the virtue that perfects our intellect in regard to right action . Prudence is connected to the moral virtues , so that the more right choices we make the better we become at making them and the more virtuous we become as persons . In other words , the better skilled we become at parenting decisions the better parents we become . To do parenting well we need to take in not just the specifics of the situation but the uniqueness of each individual child as well . Those of us who have more than one child soon came to realize that what worked with one child often did not work with another . One child might need more structure , for example , while another might need to be challenged with more freedom . If we are going to sustain life , we must meet the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not do for us as parents to say , Sorry , I 've given you your fair share of time today ; now it 's time for your brother , or your father or even me . Sustaining life can not be done impartially or justly in the sense of fair-share . Sustaining life requires fulfilling and balancing the needs of many . We parents soon learn we are human and can only do so much . We too get tired , lonely , angry , frightened . This is what it means to be embodied . Therefore we can only aim for the best the situation and the person allow and not some absolute sense of goodness . Parenting roots us , who are life-sustainers , in the practical realm , the realm of the possible . It is not wrong that we are incapable of giving our children all they need . We can only give them our personal best . What is often neglected when discussing life issues is an understanding of the role the community needs to play in helping to sustain life . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We need the " elders " in our community to help us . Grandparents are extremely important , as are other relatives . Aristotle and Aquinas stressed the importance of the " elders " in regard to teaching virtue and prudential decision-making . Yet too frequently in our society we neglect the invaluable role these people can play . A well-balanced community is one where people of all ages interact in efforts to sustain life and grow in virtue . Unfortunately , many of us struggle through our child-rearing years alone ; and when we finally muddle through it ourselves , we want nothing to do with helping younger members cope with the demanding job of parenting . Yet sustaining life well requires the efforts of every member in a community . Virtuous Activity . What then can we as parents do to encourage a consistent ethic of life ? First and foremost we must live in relationships of faithfulness where all members of our family are respected for what they are . We must acknowledge the uniqueness of each while bringing this uniqueness into a unity . We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must know that as we grow and develop we will not be shunned but will be embraced and acknowledged . Growth is an integral part of family life . We are not the same people we were when we got married , and certainly our children are not the same people they were when they were born . As we change and develop and grow we must be surrounded by people who not only permit this growth , but encourage it . We must be respected not just for who we are but for who we are becoming . Faithfulness is vital if this growth is to occur . It is by being faithful to each other and to our children that we teach them the virtue of faithfulness . Children learn much more by what they see us do than by what we tell them to do . It is up to each of us to determine how best to live out this virtue in our personal situation . In order to be faithful , we must be courageous . When we are faithful to someone we are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as well . We are vulnerable to others ' pain and anguish , and not just to their joy . Sometimes the hurt is so great that it seems we must walk away to survive . Perhaps we have lost a spouse or a child and it becomes an effort even to face the next day . We do not want to go on . In these situations , it may take a tremendous amount of courage just to survive . But if we are life-sustainers we must be courageous . We must face our fears and doubts and carry on . Sustaining life is courageous activity . There are no givens , just commitment . We need to examine how we go about developing courage in our personal lives . Sustaining life also involves not so much eliminating doubt as learning to function in the midst of doubt . We are not always sure what is the best way to sustain life , yet because we need to act , we must make a choice in the here and now . We may learn in the future that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ideal position where we can clearly see all possible outcomes of our choices . We need to act amid the muck and messiness of everyday life . We need to be attentive to the situation and take in as much information as possible , carefully make a decision and then act on our decision . If we think of a football game or a tennis match and how the players need to react instantaneously to a play , so too must we who are life-sustainers . Monday-morning quarterbacks might come up with better decisions but they were not on the playing field at the moment of action . Life-sustainers are always on the playing field . Parents are forced to make decisions daily and therefore become experienced decision-makers . What we need to do is reflect on our decisions , critically examine them and learn from them for the future . Our theory is always part of our practice , since we are interested not only in making decisions , but even more in the actual flourishing of ourselves and others . Since much of this can appear extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote life , and that element is prayer . Without prayer , not only sustaining life but sometimes even just living life can seem overwhelming . We need to pray for the virtues of faithfulness , courage and prudence and constantly seek out ways to develop these virtues in our lives . Sustaining life is virtuous activity .
