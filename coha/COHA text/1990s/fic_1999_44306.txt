WHEN SHE DISCOVERED SHE WAS EXPECTING , JEAN TOLD EVERYONE IN TOWN . NOW THERE WAS N'T GOING TO BE A NEW BABY , AND ALL SHE WANTED TO DO WAS DISAPPEAR . THE LOCAL POOL BECAME THE PERFECT REFUGE . <p> From the bedroom , Jean could hear her husband , Anders , on the phone in the kitchen . " She lost the baby , " he was saying . There were murmurs in reply to whatever was said on the other end . She heard him hang up , dial again . " Jean lost ... " Jean , still full of medicaton from the surgical procedure following the miscarriage , thought she should feel empty , but she did n't . She felt stuffed with an odd , ticklish nothingness , like a pillow full of down . Anders was only doing what she 'd asked . In the past few weeks , she 'd been so excited about being preg nant again at last that she 'd told everyone she 'd run into-in the supermarket or while picking up her daughter , Maude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd told half the people in southern Wisconsin . Now she was consumed by a deep fear of baby gifts arriving , of running into friends who would say they 'd heard the good news . Boy or girl ? they would ask , smiling . It was a girl , she imagined saying . So Jean had set Anders the task of calling back her happy , too hasty words . She heard him punching in numbers , working his way through her address book . He hated talking on the phone . Ordinarily , she was the one who called friends , booked dental appointments , ordered heating oil . But for now , it was Anders 's voice going out over the wintry telephone wires : " ... lost ... " Jean felt herself drift toward sleep . She woke briefly as the streetlights were going on , just long enough to realize Anders was still on the phone and , this time , talking to Bibi , her best friend . Maude , their lively 6-year-old , was at Bibi 's house . Jean imagined Maude slumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , Kyle , also 6 . Jean fell asleep again . When she woke for the second time , it was after midnight . She was sweating , her heart thumping painfully in her chest . She 'd been dreaming about something . But what ? From the living room , she heard the TV . Anders was watching some program with a loud laugh track . The emergency room . She 'd dreamed she 'd given birth to her baby . But after the delivery , Jean had n't been able to find her . She searched the hospital cubicle , frantically turning back the rumpled sheets . Doctors and nurses streamed by in the corridor , unconcerned about where one tiny , premature baby could have gotten to . Jean pulled on their white sleeves , crying over and over , " Help me , please . I 've lost my baby . " Awake , she felt like she 'd been punched . Even in her dreams she lost babies . In real life , though , euphemisms aside , she had n't lost anything . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died in her womb , although she probably should n't think bah She 'd lost a fetus barely out of its first trimester , not a baby capable of living on its own , even with the help of the best emergency room . Still , she could close tier eyes and see that last ultrasound , those large eyes , the tiny curled hands , the transparent heart so obviously not beating . She put her hand to her face . She was awake . This was no dream . But she was still crying . " Hey . " Anders was standing by the bed . " I thought you were asleep . " He put his palm on her cheek . " Can I get you anything ? I had chicken noodle soup . " He shrugged , knowing his suggestion was more appropriate for a cold than this heavy , wet grief " Where 's Maude ? Asleep ? " Anders shook his head . " Bibi kept her . " Jean nodded . Tomorrow would be soon enough to tell Maude , already transformed in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this was not to be . Jean sat up . Sit up . Get up , she told herself . She had a childMaude . " They say soup is good food , " she said . The flat simplicity of that slogan had always struck her as funny . " So they do , " Anders said , and went to heat some . ( continued ) THE NEXT DAY , THE , CARDS AND FLOWFRS Photograph <p> started to arrive , and friends called to offer casseroles and , because this was a college town where hardly anyone really cooked , gourmet takeout . Maude came home . Jean sat with her on the couch , a blanket curled around them to keep off both the real and imagined cold . It was March , but this was Wisconsin , and there was a fresh dusting of snow on the ground . Carefully , Jean told her about the miscarriage . Maude burrowed hard into her arms , trying , it seemed to Jean , to get as close as possibIe . ' There were tears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be born ? " she asked . Jean hugged her daughter tighter . " I do n't know , sweetie , " she said , " I really do n't know . " A WEEK LATER , CARDS WERE STILL , ARRIVing , with Sympathy , Get Well Soon , and Thinking of You messages . Obviously it was hard for people to know what to send . Jean understood.The card companies did n't have a line of Sorry to Hear About Your Miscarriage cards , though maybe they were missing a major market , considering the number of women who , since hearing about hers , had confided that they 'd had one or more pregnancies end abruptly too . Jean was grateful to all the women who wrote , but she did n't want any more doses of sympathy . She was even avoiding Bibi . When her friend called , jean pretended she was napping and let the machine pick up.Then she called back when she knew Bibi would be elsewhere , so she could leave short , perky messages on Bibi 's machine-Sorry I missed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't fooling anyone . Sorting through the cards and bills in the mail , jean found a notice from the Y. She opened it , feeling guilty . She had n't set foot in the Y in months , not since Mande finished her last round of swimming lessons , And to be honest , she had n't worked out regularly since before Maude was born . Why did n't she go now ? Maude was at school ; Anders was teaching . Jean had another week of sick leave from the college where she taught . She could go if she wanted , get some exercise , swim some laps . She could , at least , see if she still remembered the combination to her locker . Besides , then if Bibi called , Jean really would be out . IN THE END , SHE HAD TO ASK THE ATTENdant for her combination . Luckily , the information was kept on file . In the women 's locker room , she stripped off her sweater , turtleneck , and leggings , and stood in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , her pregnancy had hardly begun to show , but still her middle looked thicker than she remembered . In fact , everything on her body looked softer than she remembered . She stepped on the scale and flinched . She needed to swim laps-every day , miles and miles . She put on her suit , wrestled her hair into her cap , showered , and walked out onto the tile deck of the pool . The lifeguard looked Lip and nodded . The only people in the pool were a half dozen older women oil the far side , engaged in aquarobics . Jean eased into the water . It felt cold after the shower . The women in the aquarobics class kicked their legs to the instructor 's Count . Jean adjusted her goggics and kicked off from the wall . It took only a lap for her to realize just what bad shape she was in . After the third lap , she was gasping . She rolled over and did the backstroke.Then she alternated one lap of the crawl with one of the breaststroke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muscles in her arms and legs groaning , and her lungs felt as creaky as the hinges on their old basement door . Maybe she 'd never been any kind of athlete , but this was ridiculous . It was a wonder she did n't fall down dead just climbing the stairs to her classroom . Ten laps , she said to herself , not really thinking she would make it . Then when she did , she told herself , Fifteen is only five more . She sank into a steady , mindless rhythm , the part of swimming she 'd always liked best-no words , no time , no losses , old or new . Jean stopped feeling tired , her arms and legs trusting the buoyancy of the water , moving easily stroke after stroke . Suddenly , she had completed 30 laps . She stopped at 36 , half a mile . She could n't believe it . She 'd swum half a mile ! Her legs wobbled slightly as she climbed the ladder and walked toward the locker room . The lifeguard smiled down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " They 've posted some changes in the pool schedule for tomorrow . " Tomorrow . Had the lifeguard mistaken her for a regular ? " I will , " Jean said , trying not to pant openly . " Thanks . " JEAN DID SWIM THE NEXT MORNING , another half mile . And another the morning after that . She even took Maude to the Y for family swim time on Sunday and snuck in a dozen quick laps , one eye on her bobbing , dogpaddling daughter . On Monday , when Jean went back to teaching and did n't have time to swim in the morning , she found she spent the day thinking about when she could get to the Y. She decided to go late that night , after Maude was in bed . When she told Anders she was going , lie looked up , surprised . " Good for you , " he said , and kissed her good-bye . SWIMMING AT NIGHT WAS OKAY , BUT SHE missed the morning swim when the pool was flat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her oatmeal , she kept imagining herself moving steadily through the cold , still water . After Maude was safely off with Anders to wait for the school bus , Jean drove to the college . To her surprise , the road to the faculty parking lot was blocked by fire trucks . She stopped in a line of cars , got out , and stood looking toward the campus . She could n't see any smoke . Students , teachers , and administrators stood in small clumps by the side of the road . The chair of the English Department came over to her . " Bomb squad , " he said . " Telephone threat " Twelve years ago , when Jean had just started teaching at the college , someone had called in so many bomb threats that the semester had had to be lengthened and exams postponed . Back then , Jean had never considered that there might be a real bomb to go along with the scares . These days , though , after the Unabomber and Oklahoma City , the idea did n't seem so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real , do you ? " she asked . Her colleague shook his head . " Why go through the hassle and expense of building a bomb when a mere phone call gets you and your friends out of class ? " The dean of students , a large , unflappable woman , came over . " Consider classes officially canceled , " she said . " They 've been at it an hour and have n't even cleared the administration building yet . " Jean stood for few moments , blinking . The dean put her hands on her hips . " Do n't expect me to tell you twice to take the day off , " she said , Jean obediently got back in her car , turned it around , and headed into town . She meant to go home , clean the oven , vacuum , write thank-you notes for all those flowers . But she did n't . She went to the Y. AFTER A WEEK , SHE WAS UP TO A MILE , AND the only trouble with that was , at her speed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and the minutes spent showering and changing , and she was lucky to get done in two hours , an impossible chunk of time out of a working mother 's day . She decided to split her swimming into two shifts , early in the morning and after Maude was in bed . That way , she thought , she might even be able to increase her distance to a mile and a half But that night , when Anders saw her headed out the door with her suit , he frowned . Then , once in the pool , she just could n't get her strokes right . When she stopped after only 20 laps , her legs felt dead . Discouraged , she sat in the whirlpool , letting the tiredness seep out of her bones . Next to her , a young woman looked over and smiled . Jean recognized her as the morning aquarobics instructor . " You put in a long day , " the instructor said . " You too , " Jean said . The instructor shrugged . " I 'm working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then said , " Do you mind if I ask you something ? It 's for my thesis . " " Ask away , " jean said , expecting questions about how she used the Y , how far she swam each day . The instructor cleared her throat . " When did your mother die ? " " What ? " Jean was n't sure she 'd heard correctly . As far as she knew , her mother was asleep in a condo in Florida . " Oh , I 'm sorry if that was rude . It 's just that the data I 'm studying shows that forty-one percent of women who have just begun exercising regularly recently lost a mother . " " And the other fifty-nine percent ? " " Oh , a mix-divorce , cancer , alcohol recovery , the death of a child . " Jean winced . " I had a miscarriage , " she said . " Is that a common reason ? " " No , " the instructor said , a good Wisconsin nooo , like a softly mooing cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEAN SLIPPED INTO BED THAT NIGHT , Anders moved close and wrapped his long , warm arms around her . " Hey , Jeanie jean , " he said , and kissed her neck . " Feel like trying ? " The doctor had told them that a single miscarriage was not usually an indication of future difficulties . If they wanted more children , they should keep trying . But it was hard for jean to believe that they were going to get lucky again . " I 'm scared , " she said , and as soon as she heard the words , she knew how true they were . " Me too , Jeanie , " Anders said , holding her tight . " Me too . " And they made soft , timid love , though whether they were afraid their movements might somehow hurt the baby they had already lost or the one they had not yet conceived , Jean could n't say . That night , she even swam in her dreams . Although this pool was not full of ex-alcoholics and orphaned women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell which one was hers , but no matter how hard she tried , she could n't catch her . Finally the lifeguard made Jean climb out of the water . " You know the rules , " the lifeguard scolded . " No holding on . In this pool , the babies belong to themselves . " THE NEXT MORNING , WHEN THE ALARM went off , Jean groaned . For a moment , the memory of her dream made her think she had already been swimming . Then she rolled over , ready to get up . But as soon as her right ear touched the pillow , a ray of pain , like hot light , shot through her head . " Ow , " she said , rubbing the ear gently with her fingers . Just touching it hurt . Instead of going swimming , she waited until Maude was safety on her way to school , then drove to the clinic . The doctor immediately diagnosed the problem as swimmer 's ear . " Here , " she said , handing Jean a bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears dry . No swimming for at least ten days . " Ten days . It felt to Jean like a long , grueling sentence . IT WAS . IT GOT INTERESTING IN EARNEST that afternoon , in the middle of her remedial English class , when the campus police came in and arrested one of her students , Mickey , a sweet , quiet boy . It seemed he was the one who 'd phoned in the bomb threat . He 'd used the phone at his mother 's house , and the police had traced the call . " Well , " he said when the police cuffed him , " you caught me . " As he was led out , he turned to Jean and said , " I just want you to know , Professor Dahl , I did n't do it to get out of your class . " As soon as her class was over , Jean went to her office and called Bibi 's husband , Lloyd . He was a senior partner in a law firm . Defending bombers was n't Lloyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend 's husband and the only lawyer she knew well . When she told him about Mickey , he sighed deeply , but said that , for her , he 'd look into it . " But I wo n't kid you , Jean . It 's not good , " Lloyd said . " If they want to , they could make this a Federal case . " Then , when jean got home , Maude handed her a note from her teacher saying she was having problems at school . It was a first-Maude had never been in trouble at school before . Now the teacher wrote that Maude was not waiting in line , getting her work done , or following instructions . Maude had given Jean the note , then calmly settled herself in front of the TV , watching a video of Snow White . " She 's only six , " Jean said to Anders . " What does her teacher expect ? " Anders raised an eyebrow . " What do you expect from your students ? " Jean sighed . She had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least Maude did n't need a lawyer . " I 'll write a note , " Jean said . " Tell the teacher about ... " She thought she was going to say " the miscarriage , " but instead she said , " Maude 's grief . " The words took her by surprise . Grief . Jean felt the press of sadness . But that was her grief . And Maude 's ? Jean looked at her daughter . Maude was sucking her thumb , something she had n't done since pre school . If she could n't be a big sister , jean imagined her thinking , then why grow up at all ? Anders was watching Maude too . He shook his head . Swimming , jean thought , is simpler than this . THE NEXT DAY BROUGHT A NOTE IN RETURN , this one asking Jean to come in for a conference . Anders went , too , but stayed out on the playground , keeping watch over Maude and Bibi and Lloyd 's son , Kyle . Jean went alone and sat in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me , " said the teacher , an older woman with a soft halo of faintly blue hair . " Maude is worried about you . " She patted Jean 's hand . " She is ? " Jean asked . The teacher nodded . " But she has great confidence in you . She said you would be fine . " She tapped one finger on the table in front of Jean . " So you would n't want to disappoint her , now would you ? " When Jean came out of the school , she saw Bibi standing by the edge of the playground , watching Anders push first Maude , then Kyle on the swings . The previous fall , Bibi had had a partial mastectomy , followed by a tough round of chemo , and had lost her hair . Now it was growing back , but she kept it trimmed short . To Jean , Bibi 's hair looked like the luxurious fur on an endangered animal , some small dark cat that always had poachers after its pelt . Jean wondered what Anders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bibi said . " You 've been making yourself scarce . " Scarce , Jean thought . She imagined her new thin self in the mirrors at the Y , heard again the teacher 's voice-Maude is worried about you . It was true . Since the miscarriage , she 'd scarcely been therefor Maude , Anders , or Bibi . Suddenly , Jean thought about how the first lap felt in the morning , that blue rush of water . She could n't help it : She wished she were swimming . Bibi held her at arm 's length , looked her up and down . " But you took great , " she said . She touched a finger to Jean 's chlorine-desiccated hair . " Except you could use a good conditioner . " " Mom ! " Kyle shouted , noticing his mother for the first time . He came running over , wrapping his arms around Bibi as if she might disappear . Maude was right behind him . She grabbed Jean , hugging her hard . Kyle had almost lost his mother to cancer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maude ? What was she afraid of ? Her mother swimming away , Jean thought , and not coming back . " By the way , " Bibi said , " Lloyd called to say he 'd be late . It seems he 's representing your mad bomber . " THAT NIGHT , MICKEY 'S ARRAIGNMENT WAS on the evening news . Lloyd stood next to him . Mickey 's mother sat behind her son , dressed in a nurse 's uniform , weeping quietly . At Lloyd 's urging , the judge released Mickey into his mother 's custody pending trial . There was no mention of Federal charges . Mickey was free to go , but not , it turned out , free to come back to jean 's class . The chair of her department called to tell her the dean had expelled him . Jean could see the dean 's point of view , but what , she wondered , would Mickey do now ? After the call , she paced the living room , feeling useless and angry , until Anders actually suggested she go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to the Y to walk on the treadmill , boring herself as she did five miles . Walking in place , swimming in circles , Jean felt like a woman only pretending to get somewhere . When she got home , she found Anders in a slow boil . " Maude 's in the tub , " he said . " She refused to get out . " This was unheard of . Maude was not one to linger near soap . " She said she would n't get out unless I carried her . On top of that , she announced she was n't old enough to get dressed by herself , not even in pajamas . " " Not old enough ? " Maude had been dressing herself since she was 3 . " Where is she ? " Anders nodded at the bathroom . " I gave her a time-out . " " In the tub ? " Jean asked . Anders shrugged , his arms folded across his chest , holding his ground . Jean went into the bathroom . Maude was playing with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . " What 's the matter , sweetie ? " she asked . " Daddy yelled at me . " Rather than upset , she sounded oddly pleased with herself , as if she 'd accomplished some difficult task . " Well , " Jean said , " you would n't do what he asked and ... " She wondered what to say-and he lost it ? That hardly seemed appropriate . " Come on now , Maude , " she said . " Enough of this . It 's late , past your bedtime . Let me rinse your hair . " She picked up the old enamel saucepan they used for sluicing Maude and scooped it full of bath water . Maude covered her head with both arms . " Noooo , " she said in what Jean supposed was Maude 's idea of loud , mock rage . Jean felt a matching surge of real anger . She poured the water over Maude 's head . Maude shrieked and kept shrieking . In the small bathroom , the noise was unbearable . It was impossible not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stop it ! " Jean lifted the pan in the air , then brought it down hard on the edge of the tub . Maude stopped , stared at her mother open-mouthed . She slumped back in the tub , clutching the duck . " Go away , " she said . Jean opened her mouth and , from some wasteland of bad parenting she seemed to be trapped in , came the words , " For Pete 's sake , Maude . Quit acting like a baby . " Maude heard the word baby and burst into genuine tears . Jean felt like crying too . Instead , she scooped Maude out of the tub , wrapped her in their largest , fluffiest towel , and carried her to the couch . When Anders came tentatively Into the room , Jean shook her head and mouthed the word later . " Why ? " Maude sobbed . " Why did n't she want to be born ? Did n't she know I loved her ? " " Shhh , " Jean said , the way she had when Maude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocking her back and forth in her lap . Maude was so big now , her head bumped awkwardly against Jean 's chin . It was hard to believe Maude had ever fit inside her . She 'd been born by cesarean section after a long , unproductive labor . Anders always joked that Maude had been so comfortable , the doctor had to go and get her . Slowly , Maude 's sobbing eased , gave way to gulping hiccups . She looked up at jean . " I should have talked to her , " she said , her voice a hoarse whisper . Jean had a sudden vision of Maude on her knees , whispering to her tiny , floating sister through Jean 's belly button . Maude trembled slightly . " I should have told her I did n't want to be born either and it turned out okay . " " It did ? " Jean asked . " Sure , see , " her daughter said , and spread her hands to take in the couch , her mother , her father 's tall silhouette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kyle , Lloyd , and Bibi , her teacher , Wisconsin , America , the planet Earth . Maude nodded , as if the answer were simple . And who knew ? Jean thought . Maybe it was . Maude rubbed her eyes and yawned wide . " I did n't really know her , " she said of the sister she was n't going to have , her voice faint and sleepy , " but I miss her . " Jean kissed her daughter 's wet head . " Me too , Maude , " she said . " Me too . " * Author Affiliation Jesse Lee Kercheval was born in France and grew , up in Florida . Her last book was Space , a memoir .
