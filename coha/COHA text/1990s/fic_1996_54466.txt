Every night Mama Hallie sits on the porch of her tin-roof shanty on the banks of a Louisiana bayou , listening as a chorus of mosquitoes sings in the swamp and bull gators honk love calls through razor-sharp marsh grass . Mama Hallie sits there drinking from a mayonnaise jar with a peeling blue and white label , a jar full of iced tea laced with something the locals call " swamp water , " and on full-moon nights she talks to old Red Bob 's leg . She says his legs were the best parts of Red Bob , until the blade at his sawmill sliced the left one off above the knee one steamy summer morning . <p> Mama Hallie talks to a lot of folks . And to lots of parts of folks , because Mama Hallie 's shanty sits on a bayou fed by a river that floods every time it rains.When it rains , that river rises up over the oldest graveyard in the city , the one where folks used to be buried in the ground before the locals found out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five feet below sea level . Sometimes when the river floods the graveyard , it floats one of the coffins buried there , lifts it right out of the ground and carries it downstream . Sometimes a coffin snags on the black branches jutting out from Mama Hallie 's bank , or on the old , submerged barbed wire fence that used to surround her sixty acres of petroleum-rich land . Now the fence has been overtaken by the swamp and lies rusting under dark , foul-smelling water , snarled in a cruel hump of wire and tree limbs . When it snags a coffin , Mama Hallie goes outside after the water recedes , the ground nearly sucking her yellow galoshes off her tree stump-sized legs , and unsnarls the branches and hauls her find to her old garden spot . There she re-buries it , as is proper and fitting for Louisiana folks . On a summer night when the moon is cold and clear , and Mama Hallie 's mayonnaise jar with the peeling blue and white labelis streaming sweat from something cold and clear that 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise up out of the garden patch where tomatoes and rhubarb stalks used to grow and sit down on her porch to talk a spell . <p> And that 's how she 's come to talk a lot with Red Bob 's leg . <p> The assistant stood on Mama Hallie 's porch in his ankle-length mackintosh and droopy cowboy-style hat , pleading to come in . The sagging roof over her sagging porch was leaking brown water , and cold rain trickled over the brim of his hat and underneath his collar . " But Miss Hallie  --  " <p> Mama Hallie blocked the doorway to the shanty , her arms big as ham hocks crossed over her bosom , rock-like , immovable . " Not for sale . " <p> The assistant shivered . Water was sliding down his black raincoat and puddling in his wing-tip shoes . He was wondering who would be harder to placate  --  Mama Hallie , blocking the doorway to the fireplace behind her , or his boss , ensconced in a walnut-paneled office at the headquarters for the petroleum consortium that had sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his swivel chair , tapping his slender , silver pen on his desk blotter , listening as he tried to explain Mama Hallie 's refusal to sell and complete their buyout of Cottontree land . Then his boss would lean over to jot notes in a thick book , notes that meant the assistant 's future , that silver pen clicking furiously in and out . <p> " Please ! " He grabbed the door before she could slam it and wedged his foot in at the bottom . " Name your price to sell this property . " <p> " Not for sale , " said Mama Hallie , leaning against the door with her full weight , like a boulder precipitating an avalanche , until he thought all the bones in his foot were going to break and tried to withdraw . He jerked his leg , but his shoe caught in the door . With a desperate yank he freed himself , but his shoe remained , left behind the closed door with Mama Hallie . He stood on her porch for a minute with rain snaking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps to his car . Only then did Mama Hallie open her door , raise one beefy arm over her head , and pitch his black , size IOCC down the steps after him . <p> Mama Hallie did n't need a man 's shoe . After all , old Red Bob 's leg already had one . <p> Tyler Lott leaned back into the leather seat of the corporate jet carrying him toward Cottontree Parish . At a smooth thirty thousand feet in a frosted-white sky , the ice in his highball glass barely tinkled . He sucked on a cigar and exhaled . Ash floated down onto his knee , and a passing flight attendant flicked it off with a napkin . Ignoring her , he turned to watch their descent through the cabin window , thinking with satisfaction of the jet trail of ice crystals his arrival was making across the unsuspecting sky . <p> " Nobody could have been more inefficient , " Lott told the man sitting across the room from him . " Not only did you fail to close the deal , you antagonized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his suite at the Cottontree Grande and glared at his assistant , like a scientist affixing an insect on a pin before he places a drop of fatal alcohol on the creature 's head . <p> " Your sources were wrong , " the assistant squeaked . He cleared his throat . " Folks around here say she 's a voodoo woman . Collects weird stuff from the swamp . Money 's no inducement . " <p> Lott leaned back and smiled at the ceiling like a secret floated there . " Everybody wants money . " <p> The assistant perched on the edge of his chair . Then he got up and walked to the bar , poured some bourbon into a glass emblazoned with the hotel 's crest , and drank slowly . Finally he dared to say , " Everybody but her . " <p> Lott squinted in the sunlight reflecting off the tin roof of the shack in front of him . Behind him the engine of his rental car cracked and popped as the metal contracted . He loosened his tie ; already his shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mama Hallie 's door . <p> It opened a fraction . He saw one brown eye , fish-like , staring suspiciously out . " yes ? " <p> " Hallie Defleur ? " <p> " Folks calls me ' Mama Hallie . ' " <p> He gave her a smile . " Mama Hallie , then . I 'm Tyler Lott , from Louisiana and Arkansas petroleum . " <p> The brown eye blinked . " One of y'all already been here . " <p> " My assistant inadequately represented our intentions . May I ? " He shouldered in . <p> " Guess you wo n't leave till you 've heard no , too . " Mama Hallie opened the door . <p> His pupils adjusted painfully to the dark interior . He saw one room with a fireplace and a lumpy , battered sofa covered with an afghan crocheted in blocks of pink , green , and mustard yellow . Two rocking chairs sat by a fireplace which smelled rancid and smoky . Above the soot-blackened stones of the hearth a mantel hung at a precarious angle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantel . There was a jar of dried cat 's tails , a branch with dead leaves , and three bottles filled with a liquid the color of iodine . He stared . On the mantel sat three small , bleached-white skulls , some kind of swamp creatures with pointed snouts and tiny , sharp teeth . Moles ? he wondered . Shrews ? Possums or even house catst <p> Mama Hallie was moving out of the room and into the kitchen beyond . " Want some iced tea ? " she asked , wiping her hands on her skirt . " Humidity makes you-all sweat , do n't it ? " <p> He glanced around . The kitchen linoleum was caked with dirt , grease streaked the squatty refrigerator and stove top , but he dared not insult her . " I 'd love some . " <p> He sat gingerly in a rocking chair while she cracked trays of ice and poured tea into two mayonnaise jars , sloshing it over the sides and onto the floor as she handed him one . He sipped . " Delicious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smelling of mint and lemon . <p> " Now , what you want , Mr. Lott ? . " <p> " Mama Hallie , you 're living here alone . " <p> She nodded . <p> " You are  --  shall we say , a certain age ? " He tried to size her up , but she might have been fifty or seventy . Her face was cantaloupe-round , crisscrossed with wrinkles , but her hair was black . He continued . " One day you 'll need assistance . With cooking perhaps . Or housekeeping . " He bent over the mayonnaise jar , smothering a laugh at his joke . " We want to develop your land . We 've bought out everyone else , and we 're prepared to offer you the same attractive deal your neighbors have gotten . " He leaned back and crossed his legs , resting his arms on the arms of the rocker , reasonable , friendly , warm . <p> " Not my land . " She smiled . <p> He wiped his forehead with his sleeve . The cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courthouse books  --  " <p> " Books do n't make things so . " She swigged at her jar . <p> He looked around for a place to put his mayonnaise jar and giving up , set it on the floor between his feet . He leaned forward and propped his elbows on his knees , his eyes level with hers . " Okay , Mama Hallie . What do you want ? " <p> " Got all I need , " she said . She turned her eyes toward the mantel . " Now , I collect things . " Her gaze shifted back to him . " Stuff the swamp 's through with , like after a wolf 's ate some animal and coughs up feathers and bones . I collect what the swamp do n't want . " <p> The inside of his mouth felt like cotton . " You want something for your collection ? In trade , for your property ? I 'll make it worth your while . " <p> She smiled . " Told you , property do n't belong to me . Folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerates us , till it 's had enough , then earthquake or fire comes along , swallows everybody up . " <p> " Those are natural disasters , Mama Hallie . " He tried to restrain his anger . " You think we 're some plague of corporate locusts , come to desecrate your land ? Well , earthquakes and fires happen even to ' good ' people . " He watched her eyes . " And we 'll make something good out of this land . Drain it , produce petroleum products that enhance peoples ' lives . What 's a swamp worth to anybody ? " <p> She drained the tea from her jar and leaned forward in her chair , too , her brown eyes unblinking and her breath sweet-smelling , like peppermint , in his face . " People got this idea a thing 's got to be worth this , worth that . Some things just are . Leave this swamp alone . " She stood up . " Time for you to go , I reckon . " <p> " Get something on her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table from each other over breakfast on the hotel veranda . " Everybody has a price . " He buttered a slice of burnt toast angrily , scattering crumbs . <p> " There 's nothing , " ' his assistant said . " Just a voodoo woman , like I told you . Barters for what she needs by doctoring the locals . " <p> " What kind of doctoring ? " <p> " Folk-medicine stuff . Poultice for an ingrown toenail , herbal tea for a headache , that kind of thing . She was born on that land . She 'll die there , before she sells . " <p> Lott broke the overdone toast in half and threw it down onto his plate . He reached for a basket of fresh breads on the table . " Whatever , " he said , spearing a blueberry muffin with his knife so that the berries bled purple juice . <p> " I 'm your man , " said the man with gray hair combed carefully over his balding head . He slouched in the upholstered chair in the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he propped his fingertips together , cathedral-like , watching through half-closed eyes . He smelled faintly of kerosene . <p> Lott opened his wallet and flicked three bills into the man 's lap . The man did not move . Only his eyes changed , lizard-like , as if an inner eyelid had closed briefly over them . Lott made a disgusted sound and flicked another bill at him . The man picked up the bills one by one , wafting them past his nose , before he stuffed them into his jeans . <p> " You know what to do ? " <p> " It 's my business . You 're paying for a professional . " The man got up to go . At the door he turned around . " You must be desperate , man , burning an old lady for a few lousy acres . " <p> Lott allowed a smile to break across his face , like a crack in a frozen lake in a false spring , before winter surges back . " That 's not your business . " <p> The man shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed it behind him . Then he looked down at his hand and shuddered . The door knob was slick with a film of grease . <p> He woke two days later to the shrill of the telephone in his room . Groggy , he sat upright in bed and fumbled for the receiver . <p> " It 's still there , " said a voice on the other end of the line . <p> Lott yanked the clock from the bedside table and held it close to his face in the darkness . Fluorescent green numbers pulsed on and off slowly . " It 's three A.M. What the hell are you talking about ? " <p> The line was silent for a minute . Then the assistant said , " The shack . He did n't show . He split with the money . " <p> Lott squeezed the clock in his hand as if it were an egg he could crash in his fingers . Then he pitched it across the room in the darkness . It slammed into the far wall and fell to the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the room , confused , upside down . <p> The voice spoke again . " You want I should go down to the waterfront , find another torch ? " <p> Lott hung up on him . You want a thing done right , he thought savagely , you do it yourself . <p> Lott eased the nose of the rental car deep into the brush along the roadside . Branches scraped the doors , like tingemails on a blackboard . He raked through a bag on the seat beside him , finding a tin of black shoe polish that he smeared across his forehead and cheeks and nose , war paint-style , then opened the car door and got out , swinging the bag over his shoulder . <p> He crept along the road until he saw the shack rising before him like a shadow under the full moon . The assistant had done his part tonight ; the shack was empty , Mama Hallie on a fool 's mission to answer a call for doctoring miles away . <p> It was easy to enter . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfront to pick the lock , but there was no lock at all ; the handle turned on the first try and he walked in . He leaned against the door for a minute , listening . Nothing . The white skulls gleamed on the mantel like moths against the screen . He tiptoed past them into the kitchen . <p> The refrigerator hummed behind him as he passed from the kitchen into the bedroom . In the moonlight through the window , he could make out a thin mattress covered by a quilt . He opened another door . A closet . This was it , then . Three matchbox-sized rooms and a closet to call home . This , worth any price she would have asked . He felt anger bloom in his heart . He knelt in her bedroom and lit the pot bought from the thugs along the waterfront . There was a hiss , like gas escaping from a balloon , and then an eruption of the blue flame and sparks . Lott jumped to his feet and ran out of the house . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank to the swamp . At the water 's edge he turned to watch . The curtains at the window swayed as the fire from the pot pulled oxygen from the shack . He saw a blue glow . In a moment , he glimpsed the refrigerator through the window , illuminated by low flames creeping through the house . He heard the tin roof buckling from the rising heat . <p> He was sweating , and he licked his lips and tasted salt and a bitter taste , like robber . Wiping his forehead , forgetting the shoe polish , he was startled to see his blackened hand come down in front of his eyes . <p> The night was hot . Frogs stopped croaking and insects stopped buzzing . Maybe , he thought , they were listening to the sounds of the fire eating . The flames were sucking now , popping , crackling , chewing . They burned and ate along the pine flooring of the shack . Nails and rivets popped and snapped out of tin and wood , and he sat down at the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he heard another sound , a hissing , like water droplets on a hot frying pan . Then he heard soft plops in the swamp around him , as if an army of invisible frogs had leapt in unison into the dark water at his feet . He looked up . Rain . A cloud had rolled across the moon , and it was raining . <p> Rain . It fell in sheets , then in buckets . The flames inching through the shack were beaten back , smothered . He watched steam curl out of the blackened timbers , spin out and away from the windows . The ire sputtered and died as he wondered how much damage he had done , if he had done enough to drive her away . <p> It was over in minutes . Wind scuttled the pale clouds , blowing the rain away , and Lott shivered . He remembered the car hidden up the road . The assistant , he thought . He 'd send him to find another bum to do the job . They all had a price . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank , he stumbled and fell face-down , sliding back down the bank and into the water before he recovered himself . He got up onto his hands and knees . Although he was near the bank , the water was surprisingly deep , almost to his elbows . He tried to stand , but something under the water had snared him around his ankle . He managed to balance on one leg for a minute , hopping , then tried to drag the caught leg behind him toward the bank . <p> Impossible . Lassoed like a calf in a rodeo , he fell . He groped underwater , squeezing cold mud between his fingers . Whatever was holding him eluded him he felt only slick weeds and grasses that floated , snake-like , in the smelly water . He sat down in the water , his heart pounding with fear . It occurred to him how dangerous this was , this game played outside hotel rooms and corporate ofices . <p> He tried to stand again , and the thing kept its hold . Panicked , he grappled underwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He rolled over , staring down into the dark water . One hand burned . Holding it up , he saw his fingers were ripped and bleeding . He kicked like a mule , but the thing kept its grip . <p> He lay still , fighting fear . Nearby he heard wings rushing out of treetops . Desperately he thought of snakes and alligators . He was afraid he would die there in the darkness , and he leaned back to pace his breathing . A few white stars emerged in the clearing heavens . <p> He was not the kind of man to believe in things unseen , but he whispered , " Let me go , and I wo n't come back . " <p> He could not say how much time went by . Finally he heard a voice , and he strained to look down Mama Hallie 's dirt drive . At the end of the drive a light swung back and forth ; a lantern , he guessed . Somebody was coming down the road . I 'm saved , he thought with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mama Hallie 's bulk disengaged itself from the darkness and appeared on the bank , illuminated by the phosphorescent water . Turning , she looked at the smoldering shack . Then she put down her lantern and waded into the water , holding out her hand . " Caught in that old barbed wire , ai n't you ? " she said . <p> Lott lay on his back , staring at the swirls of paint in the stippled ceiling of his room , trying to make sense of the patrem . He thought about who might have painted these ceilings . When he 'd been a young man , he 'd wanted to be an artist . Once he 'd bought a glossy book about Michelangelo 's paintings on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel . He 'd wondered what was in Michelangelo 's mind as he lay on his back all day , paint dripping in his eyes , seeing the whole majestic mosaic of his work in his mind 's eye while his physical eye could focus only on a small patch of plaster directly overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , on the larger picture of his career and ambition . He tried to imagine his worth to his corporation , to his family , to himself . But worth was a word as light as air , as empty as a shadow , without weight or meaning , and he could see only the stippled ceiling above his bed in this New Orleans hospital . <p> His doctor came in that afternoon to wrap a fresh bandage around Lott 's lower leg and worked without speaking shaking his head when he was finished . Lott watched the doctor 's face intently . Then he turned to stare out the window of his room . He did n't need to ask what he already knew . His leg smelled just like swamp water , the foul , sick odor of things rotting . Gangrene . <p> Things go on much the same as before on the bayou of the Louisiana swamp . Mosquitoes sing and bull gators honk on a summer 's night . Mama Hallie sits on her front porch and rocks , the new pine planks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain to Cottontree Parish . After a heavy storm , the nearby river swells and overruns its banks , flooding the local graveyard until it sometimes floats a coffin downstream . When Mama Hallie finds a coffin , she carts it down to her old garden spot and re-buries it there , as is fitting and proper for Louisiana folks . Of a night when the moon grows full , some of the inhabitants of those coffins join other ghostly apparitions who pass the time on Mama Hallie 's porch . They pass the time as she rocks , sipping from her mayonnaise jar full of cold , clear " swamp water , " talking to old Red Bob 's legs . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : " Do n't moo me .
