// FOR MOST PEOPLE , MONEY IS NEVER JUST MONEY , a tool to accomplish some of life 's goals . It is love , power , happiness , security , control , dependency , independence , freedom and more . Money is so loaded a symbol that to unload itand I believe it must be unloaded to live in a fully rational and balanced relationship to money-reaches deep into the human psyche . Usually , when the button of money is pressed , deeper issues emerge that have long been neglected . As a result , money matters are a perfect vehicle for awareness and growth . Most people relate to money much as they relate to a person-in an ongoing and complex way that taps deep-seated emotions . When two individuals form an enduring relationship with each other , money is always a partner , too . In these liberated times , couples discuss many things before marriage , but the meaning of money is not one of them . Money is still a taboo topic . Often , the silence is a shield for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways with money . I , for one , would not want to tell a date that I 'm an overspender . Many individuals have a troubled relationship with money . Then , when they get into a couple relationship , money matters get explosive . Other people may have no problem with money individually ; the trouble starts after they 're in the relationship . IN TWO DECADES as a psychotherapist specializing in resolving money conflicts , I have observed that couples usually polarize around money . Partners tend to assume defense styles , or personalities , in relation to money that are direct opposites to each other . I call it Mellan 's Law : If opposites do n't attract right off the bat , then they will create each other eventually . Commonly , a hoarder marries a spender . The United States is in fact a nation of overspenders . We live in a market economy and we are led to believe that we are good citizens to the degree that we go out and spend . Because of our community breakdown and spiritual alienation , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with Things . If we 're not overspending , we 're typically worrying about money or compulsively hoarding it . We grow up in families where nobody talks about money . Most people will immediately protest : " Not true . My family talked about money all the time . " When I ask , " How did you talk ? " they reply , " My father worried about not having enough , and he yelled at my mother for spending too much . " The fact remains that people do not grow up with educational or philosophic conversations about what money is and is n't , what it can and ca n't do . We do n't examine the societal messages telling us that gratification lies in spending or that keeping up with the Joneses is important . Information-based money discussions are so taboo that we usually reach adulthood without a realistic sense of our family 's finances . I ONCE MET A MAN who had no idea that he grew up in a wealthy family . He said , " We had a family restaurant and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of doom . As a child I developed a stammer from all that money anxiety . As an adolescent , I worked day and night to keep the restaurant afloat . Years later , my mother was talking about the good old days when we were making so much money in the restaurant business . I started screaming at her about all the money anxiety I carried . I was outraged that it was n't even based on a real threat . When I stopped screaming , I noticed that my stammer was gone . " And it never returned . That 's a therapist 's dream story : one catharsis , no symptom . But it does show how money carries a huge emotional load . As a result of the money taboo , I grew up as most kids do : imitating my parents ' way of handling money without being aware of it . My father , affected by the Depression , worried out loud about money . My mother was a shopaholic , expressing love by buying me and herself clothes . She 'd hide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a good mood . As an adult , whenever I felt either depressed or particularly happy , I too would go out and shop . And even if I bought everything at a thrift store , I 'd hide all the items behind a chair until my husband was in a good mood . Actually , I alternated between shopping and worrying about money . Some people do the opposite . They typically say , " My father was a hoarder and a worrier . I hated the way he made me account for every penny of my allowance . I made a vow to myself that I 'd never be like that . " Such people , however , are anything but free of the parental attitude ; their behavior is still defined by it . In addition to irrational attitudes and beliefs about money that we internalize from our families of origin , we carry our own emotionally-charged memories of money from childhood . I remember being in a barbershop with my father when I was six , and some kid asked his father for a quarter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncontrollably . I remember being so gripped by the child 's sense of deprivation , I made a vow right then that I was never going to feel deprived like that . If you tell yourself at six that you 're never going to feel deprived , you have the makings of a chronic overspender . COUPLES POLARIZED over money engage in a balancing dance of opposites . Two spenders who come together will fight each other for the superspender role ; the other , as a defense , will learn to hoard because someone has to set limits . When it comes to defense styles , there 's always a pursuer ( or clinger ) and a withdrawer . With two withdrawers , one will become the superwithdrawer . The other will become a pursuer , because if they both withdrew there would be no connection at all . An equally common polarity is the is worrier and avoider . Avoiders do n't focus on the details of their money life , such as whether they have enough money or how much interest they 're paying on their credit cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate into an avoider just as a way of escaping the avalanche of worry . And an avoider will turn a mate into a worrier . Two partners could n't both avoid forever ; somebody will eventually get concerned and take on the worrier role . Doubling the trouble , hoarders are usually worriers and spenders are usually avoiders . As with all polar personality styles , hoarders and spenders live in different universes marked by opposing beliefs . What feels good to one feels horrible to the other . When not spending , a hoarder feels virtuous , in control . A spender when not spending feels anxious and deprived . Indeed , spenders ca n't tolerate the word " budget " ; financial planners have to draw up a " spending plan . " Other money personalities include planners , who are detail-oriented , and dreamers , who are global visionaries . In addition , there are money monks , often ex-hippies , political activists or spiritual souls , who feel that money corrupts and it 's better to not have too much . Sometimes they marry money amassers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins . Amassers are not hoarders ; they do n't simply save , they invest to make their money grow They save , spend and invest . WHAT MAKES EACH OF the personality types is the operation of internal belief systems , what I call money myths-all the money messages , vows and emotional memories acquired from the family of origin , the peer group , the culture at large and filtered through a person 's intrinsic temperament . Many spenders , for example , do n't give away just money ; they are effusive with feelings , words , everything . Hoarders are typically taciturn and withholding . Even in therapy , they have to be encouraged to open up . Here is the ironic part . The longer couples are married , the more they lock into polarized roles . Then they attack each other for their differences , projecting onto the other attitudes about every other spender or hoarder they have encountered in their life . They fail to acknowledge the positive aspects of their partner 's personality type and of the balancing dance itself . The failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstanding and hurt . Take the case of a man who views money as security . He does not believe in spending a great deal on gifts ; he believes in saving . He 's married to a woman who believes that money is both love and happiness ; she 's a spender . They are about to celebrate a major anniversary . He spends days in record stores searching for the song they danced to when they were dating in the ' ' 60s , " their song . " When she gets his gift , she thinks he 's chintzy and is insulted . He 's inconsolably hurt . She , meanwhile , has bought him an expensive gift . Money issues rarely manifest themselves openly in relationships . Instead , couples fight over what money represents . And while money issues can rear their head anytime ; there are specific transition periods in relationships that force them to the surface : tax time , starting a family and buying a house . Couples may complain , " We ca n't agree on where we want to live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I want to save our money for retirement . " Or , " She keeps indulging the children , getting them everything they want , and I do n't think that 's good for the kids . " In addition to money personalities , there are male-female differences in approaches to money that haunt many relationships . It could be said that some differences reflect men as hunters and women as gatherers . In his theater piece Defending the Caveman , Rob Becker describes men : they go out and buy a shirt , wear it until it dies , then go out and kill another shirt . Women , in contrast , gather . They shop for this for next Christmas for their niece and for that for their son-in-law . OTHER PERVASIVE MONEY differences exist between the genders . First , men and women have differences of personal boundaries because they are both raised largely by women . Men have to psychologically separate more rigidly from women because of the sex difference ; women do not have to separate so rigidly , and therefore can afford less distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world as hierarchical and competitive . There 's always a one-up and one-down position , a winner and a loser . Women see the world as cooperative and democratic ; they share . In addition , they are allowed-even encouraged-to be needy and vulnerable , while men are discouraged from such display . The boundary and hierarchical differences between men and women lead to clashes around money decisionmaking . Men think nothing of going out alone and buying a big-screen TV or even the family car or computer , then coming home and saying , " Hi honey I have a new car . " She says , " Why did n't you consult me ? I thought we were a team . " And he says , " Are you my mother ? Do I have to ask your permission ? " Because of their more rigid boundaries , men think of themselves as islands and withdraw when facing difficulties of intimacy They do n't see themselves as part of a team . And , of course , men and women are raised to believe different things about the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , men are still bred to believe they will be good at dealing with money-although nobody tells them how to do it . In that way , money is like sex ; they 're just supposed to know . Women are raised to believe they wo n't be good at it and , if they 're lucky , some man will take care of the details of money and investing . One of the major financial houses recently canvassed high school students and asked how good they were about math and money . The boys said , " We 're pretty good . " The girls said , " We 're not very good . " In fact , they both knew the same amount about money ; but their confidence levels were vastly different . Moreover , when men make money in the stock market , they credit their own cleverness . When they lose money , they blame the incompetence of their advisors or bad luck . When women make money in the market , they credit the cleverness of their advisors , good luck or even the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This explanatory style is literally and figuratively depressing . In addition , women are still paid three-quarters of what men are paid for the same job . These events conspire to reduce women 's confidenceand inspire " bag-lady " nightmares . Because of the forced dependency on men to make decisions about money , women fear being out on the street with nothing . When men make more money than their spouse , they believe their superior earnings entitle them to greater power in decision-making . By contrast , women who make more than their mates almost always desire democratic decision-making . As a woman and a therapist , I have a definite bias towards shared decisionmaking and shared power . It is the only arrangement that works . I prefer to think of men 's sense of money not as an entitlement but as a defense against the terrible provider-burden they carry . Men are trained to believe that money equals power and that power is the path to respect . However , power and control are not compatible with intimacy . Relationships succeed only when both partners are willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for men to know that failing to share power cheats them of the intimacy and love they want . ANOTHER IMPORTANT difference between men and women concerns their interests in merging their money . Typically , men want to merge all the couple 's money-while maintaining primary decision-making power . Women want to keep at least some money separate . The fight goes like this : HE : " Why do you want separate money ? You must not trust me . Are you planning to file for a divorce ? " SHE : " Why do you want to merge all of our money ? It must be that you want to control me . " There may be truth in both positions . Still , experience has led me to see a very positive , and probably unconscious , longing in both views , and it has to do with the challenge of intimacy . Merging , getting connected and staying connected , is more difficult for men . At the first sign of conflict , it 's easy for them to withdraw . I believe that men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of the desire for intimacy and connection . Perhaps it is even a safeguard against their withdrawing . I have come to see that women want separate money as a loving expression of their need for healthy autonomy Their biggest challenge in relationships is not losing themselves ; it 's holding on to their own sense of self . Neither his demand for merged money nor her desire for separate funds is a position taken up against the spouse-although that is how partners tend to see it . When couples understand this , their new perspective has the power to transform their entire relationship . American culture , I believe , makes a big mistake in pressuring married couples to merge all their money . It is in fact unwise for couples to merge money right away . Since couples do n't talk about money before they marry , you do n't know if you 're tying yourself to an overspender in debt or a worrier who could drive you crazy Couples can merge some of their common assets for joint expenses , savings and investing and keep the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your partner does n't get to comment on how you spend your money . I 've always kept a portion of money apart because I knew I was an overspender and I did n't want to mess up the family finances or credit rating . Alternatively , couples could merge some money and only the woman could have separate funds . Solutions do not have to be symmetrical to work well . They just have to appeal to the deeper needs of both partners . The difficulty is in making clear to the other what your own needs are . MONEY ISSUES ARE different from other problems in relationships . They 're harder to talk about and harder to resolve because of our extensive cultural conditioning . The most important thing in couples communication is empathy , or putting yourself in your partner 's place . It is almost always more important to be heard and understood than to have a partner agree with what you say Spouses who start talking genuinely about what they like about each other 's money style create an atmosphere of safety and nondefensiveness . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once couples understand the positive intent of the partner , they can then work out a solution to almost any problem , a solution that best fits their own unique needs . <p>
