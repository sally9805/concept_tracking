THE DOOR IS NOT CLOSED YET , BUT THERE IS FINALly a move to narrow the entry . After months of seeking consensus , Chancellor Helmut Kohl 's ruling coalition and the opposition Social Democrats have come to terms on a revision of Germany 's liberal asylum laws . The parties insist that the fundamental right of asylum for the persecuted has been preserved . But the new provisions will allow the government to turn away individual asylum seekers who enter Germany from a nation that observes the Geneva Convention on refugees . Prospective claimants passing through Poland or Czechoslovakia , for example , on their way to Germany can be returned to those countries . The move , politicians hope , will stem the influx of foreigners and reduce xenophobia.
