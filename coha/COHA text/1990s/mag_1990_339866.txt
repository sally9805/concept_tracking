" I 'm ashamed that I have to revive dark memories and reopen old wounds , " said South Korea 's former ruler Chun Doo Hwan , finally breaking the silence that followed his retirement in early 1988 . Appearing before a special panel of the National Assembly , Chun , 58 , accepted " moral responsibility " for the excesses of his seven-year rule . But members of the opposition exploded in protest when Chun denied responsibility for the 1980 deaths of 200 demonstrators in Kwangju and argued that the army had rightfully fired on a crowd . One legislator dashed to the witness stand , grabbed Chun by the arm and shouted , " Murderer ! " <P> Chun 's testimony was the last act of a public exorcism staged by government and opposition leaders to erase the final traces of the Chun era . But the angry response to Chun indicates that Koreans are not yet willing to forgive or forget .
