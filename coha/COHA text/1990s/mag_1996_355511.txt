Joan Didion 's first novel in 12 years offers early on the rather surprising assertion that it is not fictional at all . The second chapter of The Last Thing He Wanted ( Knopf ; 227 pages ; $23 ) begins , " For the record this is me talking . You know me , or think you do . The not quite omniscient author . " This claim that Didion , the journalist and screenwriter , is writing as herself is followed by the news that she had considered giving herself an invented identity and name , to wit " Lilianne Owen , " and telling the story under this disguise . That , she adds , did n't work : " As Lilianne Owen I could not have told you half of what I knew . I wanted to come at this straight . " <P> Straight , however , is an uncannily precise word for the way this novel is not told . It jumps back and forth in time . It tries on different narrative methods ; in some chapters dialogue is without quotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's central event  --  the reason the narrator chose to tell this story in the first place  --  could be fairly well conveyed on a postcard . It is , in fact , foreshadowed on page 12 . The Last Thing He Wanted is as much concerned with its own telling as it is with the story it tells . <P> It begins more or less in 1984 , when a Washington Post reporter named Elena McMahon abruptly quits covering the 1984 presidential campaign for her paper . Earlier , Elena had walked out of her marriage to Wynn Janklow , a Los Angeles megamillionaire , taking their teenage daughter Catherine with her . " She knew how to cut and run , " says the narrator , who had met Elena in Los Angeles ; both were regular invitees to Oscar-night parties that strongly resemble , as described here , the legendary ones thrown by the late agent Irving ( " Swifty " ) Lazar . Didion 's narrator does not dwell on this detail , but it is dropped nonetheless , as if to show that her heroine has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly footloose Elena flies to Florida to visit her father Dick , who may or may not have been in the CIA at one point  --  he tells his daughter he knows someone who " was involved in Dallas "  --  and who now , at 74 , is on the verge of big payday , delivering and selling a planeload of unspecified merchandise somewhere in the Caribbean . It is 1984 , after all , and the region is abuzz with preparations for what would later be described as the Iran-contra affair . Unfortunately , her father falls ill , and Elena agrees to accompany the plane on its mission and pick up the million dollars he expects to receive . <P> This decision speaks well of her as a loyal daughter but very poorly of her as a sentient human being . She has no idea what she is getting into , no premonition that her father had been set up as a fall guy by one of the several rogue factions within the U.S. government operating in the area . She is a babe in the palm trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time that the heroine is drifting toward a bad end , Didion 's narrator is working on a magazine profile of the one person who might be able to save her : State Department troubleshooter Treat Morrison . " This was a man who could pick up the telephone and affect the Dow , reach the Foreign Minister of any one of a dozen NATO countries , the Oval Office itself . " Morrison jets to the unnamed island where Elena is waiting to be paid , and the two of them ... fall in love . " This is a romance after all , " Didion 's narrator confesses . It does n't last long .
