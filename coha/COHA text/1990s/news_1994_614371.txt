<p> I consider myself to be a Christian and every time " Doubting Thomas " Teepen disagrees with us , I know in my heart that we surely must be doing something right . A slap from him is a badge of honor . <p> Speeding incident turns into nightmare <p> RANDY WATKINS , Fayetteville <p> I would like to let the citizens of Fulton County know what they were paying three of their police officers to do on the evening of July 13 , 1994 . <p> About 8:30 p.m . I was pulled over for speeding on Ga . 138 heading west close to Shannon Mall . I was then surrounded by three officers in two patrol cars . <p> The officer in the first car told me he followed me ( he did not have a radar ) doing 62 mph in a 45 mph zone . The speed limit , by the way , is 55 mph heading east . <p> The traffic was light , and the four-lane highway was dry . The officer then went back to his car and wrote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 minutes later the three officers approached my car again and I was handed the ticket to sign . <p> I began reading the ticket and was immediately told to hurry up because the officer " did not have time for this . " I told him I was going to read it and he would have to take the time . <p> At this time the officer jerked my door open and pulled me out of my car . He began to search me while the other two began to search my car . I was thrown in the back of his patrol car where I watched all three officers search my car for the next hour and a half . <p> They searched my trunk , glove box , console , wallet , checkbook and every square inch of my car . They found absolutely nothing . <p> Two of the officers then left while I watched the wrecker pick up my car . I was then taken to Fulton County jail at speeds in excess of 90 mph . I asked the officer if I could put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I spent the next five hours in a cell with about 15 drug addicts , who asked me if I wanted to buy some drugs . I had six mug shots taken , and was fingerprinted 12 times . <p> By the time I got my car and got home it was 5 a.m . I had to get up 30 minutes later and go to work . <p> I did not give the officer any reason to do what he did . He was very rude and unprofessional . <p> I was charged only with speeding . I am warning anyone who is pulled over in south Fulton County not to attempt to read his or her speeding ticket . <p> Clayton General board was too forceful <p> FRANK HYDE , Peachtree City <p> Some five or six years ago , with the onrush of people moving into the Fayette County area , the movers and shakers decided the most urgent need for our county was a hospital . This so disturbed Clayton General Hospital that they violently opposed this notion . <p> When it was finally determined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was the hospital that would be built . For whatever reason , it began a name-changing operation . <p> The original Clayton General became Georgia MedCorp , then Southern Regional , then Fayette County Hospital . I think this is a move to disguise the fact that it is still Clayton General . <p> The people of Fayette County had voiced their objection to Clayton General . They wanted a better hospital . However , because of the influence of two state senators from Clayton County , a certificate of need was awarded to Clayton General . <p> Three prominent hospitals filed objections to this choice and through the revolving door came a CON that was the factor in this win for Piedmont . <p> My choice for a hospital was Georgia Baptist , for its reputation for indigent care . We are fast coming into an era of time when some 20 percent of the population will not be able to get quality care because of skyrocketing costs . <p> I believe Georgia Baptist has more sympathy and understanding for the people of Georgia . It best fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much though , and I will be glad to see Piedmont Hospital come to Fayette County . <p> What disturbs me most is some of the statements I read in the local papers about these people on the board of directors of Clayton General Hospital . They are really saying to us that we are n't capable of determining who should build a hospital . Just be silent and let the fabulous five do all the thinking . <p> Down through the pages of history , we see where all the decisions to be made were turned over to one or two men . But this is not the American way . <p> I did not go to war some 50 years ago to let someone else do my thinking for me . I believe the people of Fayette County have a higher mentality than to sit back and be subjugated by the likes of these people . <p> I hope Piedmont Hospital will start construction tomorrow . <p> McDonald 's prudent in flag controversy <p> J.E . ENGLISH , Atlanta <p> I would like to offer my compliments to McDonald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy . Their position follows that of the Super Bowl committee and others regarding this issue . Holiday Inn would have been prudent to have done the same . <p> A very recent poll has again expressed the opinion that the majority of Georgians do not want their flag changed . Even more noteworthy , this poll revealed that now , for the first time , over half of Georgia 's African-Americans do not favor legislation to change the flag . This should send a clear message to those high profile , anti-flag activists who have created the flag controversy and continue to make it a divisive issue among our people . <p> A part of our flag simply honors the heritage and bravery of those who made the supreme sacrifice during a tumultuous period of our country 's history . If those who oppose the flag can not or will not understand this truth , then there remains little to be said to convince them otherwise . <p> Any health-care bill will be meaningless <p> RODDRICK R. THORNTON , East Point <p> When I think about the ongoing health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither the Democrats nor Republicans are genuine in their handling of health care reform . <p> First of all , President Clinton and the Democrats on Capitol Hill are only interested in passing health care reform legislation by Congress 's fall recess . Unfortunately , I believe that Clinton would sign any health care reform legislation that passes both houses of Congress . Many congressional Democrats are being harshly criticized in their districts for supporting Clinton and need something to boast about in their campaigns . Clinton and the Democratic Party know that the defeat of health care reform may lead to some key Democratic losses in the fall elections . <p> On the other hand , Sen. Bob Dole and the Republicans are acting like the defensive line of a football team . Their only goal is to impede the passage of health care reform until the next congressional session . With some key congressional wins in November , the Republicans could take control of the Senate and attenuate , if not shatter , the Democratic stranglehold on the House . Obviously , the Republicans are seizing every opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the real losers in this political quagmire are the American people . Any health care reform legislation that comes out of Congress will be extremely diluted and somewhat meaningless . Is this the change that the American people wanted two years ago ?
