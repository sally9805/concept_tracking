Each person , withdrawn into himself , behaves as though he is a stranger to the destiny of all the others . His children and his good friends constitute for him the whole of the human species . As for his transactions with his fellow citizens , he may mix among them , but he sees them not ; he touches them , but does not feel them ; he exists only in himself and for himself alone . And if on these terms there remains in his mind a sense of family , there no longer remains a sense of society . Alexis de Tocqueville During the first two weeks of May , I listened to a great many politicians worry about the scenes of urban apocalypse in South-Central Los Angeles , but the more often they mentioned " the crisis of the cities " or " the need for meaningful reform , " the less convincing I found their expressions of concern . Most American politicians neither like nor trust the temperament of large cities , and their habitual animosity showed through the veneer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " healing the wounds of racial injustice , " " a tragedy for us all , " " human suffering , " " rebuilding America 's destiny "  --  and although many of them even went to the point of promising money  --  " enterprise zones , " " relief funds , " " bank loans "  --  it was clear that they would rather have been talking about something else . President George Bush appeared briefly in Los Angeles on May 7 and 8 , a week after rioting and fire had laid waste to roughly fifty square miles of the landscape , and his palpable uneasiness defined the tenor of the response from the leading manufacturers of the country 's conscience and opinion . What he said was n't much different from what everybody else said ( c.f. , the anguish in Time and Newsweek , Governor Bill CIinton 's campaign statements , the anguish on Nightline and Meet the Press , Governor Pete Wilson 's press conferences , the anguish of Dan Rather ) , but Mr. Bush has a talent for embodying a falsity of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his performance in Los Angeles admirably represented the attitudes of a social and political class that regards the city as its enemy . He arrived among the ruins of Vermont and Western avenues at dawn on Thursday , riding in a heavily armed limousine under the protective escort of the Secret Service , the L.A.P.D. , and the National Guard . His advisers allowed him to remain in the neighborhood for no longer than three hours in the early morning , before too many people were abroad in the streets , and his entourage had gone before most of the local residents knew that it had come . Walking through streets still sour with the smell of smoke , the President was obviously disturbed by what he saw of the wreckage , and his unscheduled remarks veered off in the direction of unfamiliar emotion . Speaking to a small congregation in a Baptist church , he said , " We are embarrassed by interracial violence and prejudice . We are ashamed . We should take nothing but sorrow out of all of that and do our level best to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President was chastened by the sorrow and resentment of the people to whom he spoke , but his words were somehow tentative and contingent , as if they could be withdrawn on a month 's notice . C-Span 's television cameras followed him on his pilgrim 's progress through the ashes of an urban slum , and as I watched him keep to his schedule of condolence I understood that it was a small , drawing-room story about George Bush ( his education , conduct , and deportment ) , not a large and tragic story about a society that could inflict upon itself the despairing ruin of South-Central Los Angeles . By Friday morning the President had recovered his optimisms and his sense of political proportion . He announced a gift of $19 million ( for clinics and schools and the harrying of drug dealers ) and he went to a hospital to visit a fireman severely wounded by gunfire on the first night of the rioting . Partially paralyzed and unable to speak , the fireman lay on his bed watching Mr. Bush sign autographs and hand out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a moment of awkward silence he said to the fireman 's wife , " This is fantastic . We 're glad to be here . Absolutely . " To the wife of another fireman injured in the riots , the President , still trying to make polite conversation and meaning to show that he , too , was acquainted with grief , spoke of the heavy seas that had come last October to Kennebunkport : " I 'm sorry Barbara 's not here . She 's out repairing what 's left of our house . Damn storm knocked down four or five walls . She says it 's coming along . " The American ruling and explaining classes tend to live in the suburbs , or in cities as indistinguishable from suburbs as West Los Angeles and the government preserves of Washington , D.C. , and their fear and suspicion of the urban landscape ( as well as the urban turn of mind ) would have been well understood by the gentlemen who founded the republic in Philadelphia in 1787 . The idea of a great city never has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country 's political and literary history suggests that the city stands as a metaphor for depravity  --  the port of entry for things foreign and obnoxious , likely to pollute the pure streams of American innocence . Virtue proverbially resides in villages and small towns , and for at least two hundred years the rhetoric of urban reform has borrowed its images from the Bible and the visionary poets . Under the open sky ( or a reasonable facsimile thereof ) the faithful gather by the firelight to denounce the metropolitan sewers of crime and vice , and every now and then a knight errant  --  Jimmy Carter , Ralph Nader , Gary Hart , Ross Perot , et al .  --  rides off toward the dark horizon under the banners of redemption . A similar bias informs the romantic spirit of American literature and provides the plots for popular melodrama . With remarkably few exceptions , the writers of genius decry the foul and pestilent air of the city , and instead of staying in town to paint the portraits of society they wander off into the wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Melville in the vastness of the southern ocean , Hemingway off the coast of Cuba  --  all of them glad of their escape from the stench of commerce in Boston and New York . The conventional hero of the western or detective story ( sometimes known as John Wayne or Humphrey Bogart , at other times taking the alias of Gary Cooper , Clint Eastwood , or Harrison Ford ) rides into the dusty , wooden town and discovers evil in even the most rudimentary attempts at civilization . The hero appears as if he were a god come to punish the sin of pride and scourge the wicked with a terrible vengeance . After the requisite number of killings , the hero departs , leaving to mortal men and women ( i.e. , wretched citizens ) the tedious business of burial , marriage , and settlement . The movies and television series delight in showing the city as a killing ground . Predators of every known species ( pimps , real estate speculators , drug addicts , prostitutes , dissolute prosecuting attorneys , and venal police captains ) roam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serengeti plain . The successful protagonists learn to rely on their animal instincts . If they make the mistake of remaining human ( trusting to the civilized virtues of tolerance and compassion ) , they die a fool 's death in the first reel . Given the preferred image of the city as godforsaken heath , it 's not surprising that so many American cities come to look the way that the audience wants and expects them to look . The proofs of worldly ruin give credence to the theorems of transcendental grace . If American cities have the feeling of makeshift camps , littered with debris and inhabited , temporarily , by people on the way to someplace else , it is because we conceive of them as sulfurous pits in which to earn the fortune to pay for the country rose garden and the house with the view of the sea . The pilgrims come to perform heroic feats of acquisition and then to depart with the spoils to the comforts of Florida or the safety of Simi Valley . To the extent that we measure the distance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vice , we confuse metaphysics with geography , and so imagine that blessedness is a property of the right address . During the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 , in the early afternoon of the day on which the thermonuclear judgment was believed to be well on its way north from Havana , the city editor of the New York Herald Tribune sent me into Times Square to ask random citizens for opinions on their impending doom . Most of the respondents expressed a degree of anxiety appropriate to the circumstances , but I remember a woman from Lake Forest , Illinois , who told me that I had addressed my question to the wrong person , and who smiled as agreeably as President Bush handing out tie pins in the Los Angeles hospital room . " I wish I could help you , " she said , " but I do n't live here , you see . I 'm just visiting from out of town . " The spirit of the age is feudal , and the fear of the cities allies itself not only with the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of freedom . The energy of the city derives from its hope for the future and the infinite forms of its possibility . The city offers its citizens a blank canvas on which to draw whatever portraits of themselves they have the wit and courage to imagine . Nobody asks them to constantly explain their purpose , and they remain free to join the minorities of their own choosing . Among people whom they regard as their equals , who share the same passions for seventeenth-century religious painting or Edwardian licentiousness , they can come and go in whatever direction their spirit beckons . The freedom of the city is the freedom of expression and the freedom of the mind . So precious are these freedoms that the citizens judge the city 's squalor as a fair price for its promise . What suburban opinion deplores as unmitigated abomination  --  bad air , poverty , noise , crowds , crime , traffic , heavy taxes , exorbitant rents , cynical government  --  the citizen accepts as the cost of liberty . It is in the nature of great cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future to be dangerous . The complexity of life in the city engenders in the inhabitants an equivalent complexity of thought and a tone of mind that can make a joke of paradox and contradiction . The ideal of the city as an expression of man 's humanity to man never has enjoyed much of a constituency in the United States . The stones of Paris and London and Rome speak to the citizenry 's high regard for the proofs of civilization . If it is possible to walk calmly through the streets of those cities late at night , it is not only because the government gladly spends money on public fountains but also because the other people in the streets take pride in their civility . Americans take pride in the building of roads and weapons systems as well as in their gifts for violence . We know how to mount expeditions  --  to the Persian Gulf or the California frontier or the moon  --  but we lack a talent for making cities . The broad retreat to the suburbs over the last twenty or thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make time stand still . The politics of the Nixon , Reagan , and Bush administrations made manifest a San Diego realtor 's dream of Heaven and defined the great , good American place as an exclusive country club . Expressions of the same sentiment take forms as various as the judgments of the Rehnquist court , Senator Jesse Helms 's suspicions of the National Endowment for the Arts , the ascendance of conservative and neoconservative socioeconomic theory , the sermons of George Will , the division of the county of Los Angeles into a series of residential enclaves ( Bel-Air , Beverly Hills , Pasadena , etc. ) as fiercely defended ( by gates and electronic surveillance and regiments of liveried police ) as the feudal manors of medieval Europe . As the larger business corporations come to employ as many people as lived in Renaissance Florence , they acquire the character of fiefs and dukedoms , and by shifting their headquarters into landscapes luxurious with English lawns and avenues of trees , they signify the splendor of their superiority  --  both moral and financial  --  to the urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another corporation has quit New York City for a country estate in Virginia or Connecticut , I think of the United States receding that much farther into the past . The company of the elect becomes too quickly and too easily estranged from the democratic argument . Already protected from chance and uncertainty by the walls of bureaucratic protocol , the ladies and gentlemen of executive rank become ever more fearful of strangers  --  of Al Sharpton and Puerto Rican Day parades as well as of rats , pestilence , and crime  --  and their distrust of the city soon resembles the contempt so often and so smugly expressed by Vice President Quayle . The fear is contagious , and as larger numbers of people come to perceive the city as a barren waste , the more profitable their disillusion becomes to dealers in guns and to the political factions that would destroy not only New York and Chicago but also the idea of the city . During the decade of the 1980s the federal government reduced by 60 percent the sum of money assigned to the nation 's cities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deductions embodied a cultural prejudice as well as a political doctrine . The same bias shows up in the seminars conducted by professors of urban science who blandly announce  --  invariably with many smiling references to the wonders of modern telecommunications  --  that the United States no longer has need for large cities . From the point of view of civil servants and Baptist ministers , the revelation might be construed as good news , but not from the point of view of anybody still interested in freedom . The hatred of cities is the fear of freedom . Freedom implies change , which implies friction , which implies unhappiness , which disturbs the nervous complacency of the admissions committee at the country club . Because the city promises so many changes and transformations ( a good many of them probably dangerous or unhealthy ) , the act of decision presents itself as a burden instead of an opportunity . Confronted with the dilemma of making moral and existential choices , the friends of Vice President Quayle and Chief Justice Rehnquist seek to escape their confusion by declaring freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the feudal countryside , where few strangers ever come to trouble the villagers with news of Trebizond and Cathay . In the whole of the editorial autopsy conducted by the news media in the days following the Los Angeles riots , I never heard anybody say anything about the popular hatred of the freedoms of a great city . I know that the topic is not one that the political and intellectual authorities like to discuss , but without at least mentioning it in passing , the familiar indices of poverty and crime make little sense . Until we learn to value the idea of the city , we can expect to see the streets paved with anger instead of gold . The more well-intentioned the reforms announced by the politicians and the more theatrical the anguish of Newsweek or Barbara Walters , the more clearly I could hear the voice of suburban triumph . The guests assembled on a lawn in Arlington or Kennebunkport nod and frown and piously confuse New York or Los Angeles with the Inferno imagined by Dante or Mel Gibson . A drift of smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuses their loathing for the multiplicity of both the human imagination and the human face . <p>
