Section : Culture &; ideas Imagine a purer , less commercial , more spiritual Christmas . But do n't call it history <p> The yearning begins with the first shimmer of tinsel on a streetlamp downtown , the first tree glimpsed through a frosty window , the first familiar notes filtering into consciousness at the grocery store or at the mall . It is a longing impervious to the assaults of the season : to the car salesmen dressed up as reindeer , the 1,652nd reprise of " White Christmas " on the radio , the 14th marital spat that ends with " She 's your relative ! " And as the season ripens , it grows , displacing a year 's worth of weariness , cynicism and general , late-20th-century anxiety . You can see it in the eyes of a child dragging a Christmas tree across the snow in Maine , in the faces of carolers at New York City 's South Street Seaport , in the Santa hat atop a " cattle crossing " sign near Blanco , Texas . <p> Christmas is an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some form , according to a recent U.S. News/Bozell poll . Yet for most people , the holiday triggers an intense search for some dimly remembered Christmas past , a nostalgia for a time when yuletide was more pious and more peaceful , when it was free of gaudy commercialism and focused more on the birth of the Savior than on the 20 percent-off sale at the local department store . <p> The only problem is that , as historians are increasingly discovering , this purer , simpler , more spiritual past is more a product of our cultural imagination than of historical fact . A series of new studies suggests that the observance of Christmas was never an entirely religious affair , that many of the most popular seasonal traditions are relatively modern inventions and that complaints of crass overindulgence and gross commercialism are nearly as old as the holiday itself . <p> An affront unto God . Through most of its history , the Christmas season has been a time of raucous revelry and bacchanalian indulgence more akin to Mardi Gras or New Year 's Eve than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , was its reputation in colonial America that celebrating Christmas was banned in Puritan New England , where the noted minister Cotton Mather described yuletide merrymaking as " an affront unto the grace of God . " In a new book , The Battle for Christmas , University of Massachusetts history professor Stephen Nissenbaum describes the annual birthday celebration of the Prince of Peace as a perennial battleground for competing cultural , religious and economic forces . " There never was a time when Christmas existed as an unsullied domestic idyll , immune to the taint of commercialism , " Nissenbaum writes . <p> The earliest celebrations of the Nativity were surprisingly late . There is no record of official observance of Christ 's birth until the fourth century , when Constantine , a Christian convert , was emperor of Rome . The absence of a Nativity celebration before then , scholars say , reflects at least in part the fact that no one knew for sure when Jesus was born . While some church traditions place his birth between 6 B.C. and 4 B.C.  --  near the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent on the year , let alone the exact month or day . <p> Lacking any scriptural pointers to Jesus 's birthday , early Christian teachers suggested dates all over the calendar . Clement , a bishop of Alexandria who died circa A.D. 215 , picked November 18 . Hippolytus , a Roman theologian in the early third century , figured Christ must have been born on a Wednesday  --  the same day God created the sun . The De Pascha Computus , an anonymous document believed to have been written in North Africa around A.D. 243 , placed Jesus 's birth on March 28 , four days after the first day of spring . <p> But even if they had known the date , says University of Texas historian Penne Restad , the earliest Christians simply were n't interested in celebrating the Nativity . " They expected the Second Coming any day , " writes Restad in her 1995 book , Christmas in America : A History . To celebrate Christ 's birth would have seemed to them pointless . Moreover , she says , they " viewed birthday celebrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared it a sin to even think of keeping Christ 's birthday " as though he were a king pharaoh . " <p> Raised from the dead . What interested the early Christians more , historians say , was proclaiming the central message of their faith : that the crucified Christ had been raised from the dead . So important was the Resurrection to church life that the Apostle Paul , writing in about A.D. 56 to the church in Corinth , asserted : <p> If Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain . ... But in fact , Christ has been raised from the dead . <p> The early focus on the Resurrection explains why the Pascha , the Easter festival commemorating the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus during the Jewish Passover , was the only annual celebration known to the early church , says Brian Daley , a theology professor at the University of Notre Dame . Today , Easter remains the most important event on the Christian calendar , even though 70 percent of Americans  --  including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. News/Bozell pollsters that they consider Christmas the most significant Christian holiday . <p> The fact that the earliest gospel  --  St. Mark 's , written about A.D. 50  --  begins with the baptism of an adult Jesus at the start of his public ministry is yet another indication that the earliest Christians lacked interest in the Nativity , scholars say . Only St. Matthew 's and St. Luke 's gospels , written two to four decades later , include stories about Christ 's birth . By that time , says Paul Maier , professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University , " Christians , believing in both the divinity and humanity of Jesus , were curious to know how he came to be . " Even so , there is no mention in the New Testament of Christians gathering to commemorate the birth of Jesus . <p> It was conflict that eventually propelled the church toward celebrating the Nativity , some scholars contend , as it attempted to counter heresies growing within its ranks . Among the most contentious of the heresies was Docetism , the belief that Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This had momentous significance for the Christian view of salvation , " says Paula Fredriksen , professor of ancient Christianity at Boston University . " If Christ had no body , then there was no bodily Crucifixion or Resurrection . " But by the fourth century , the official stand of the church in Rome was that Christ was raised in both body and spirit and , consequently , both the believer 's body and soul are redeemed in salvation . Celebrating the birth of Jesus then , says Fredriksen , " was one way of emphasizing that Christ had a real human body . " <p> Matter of conjecture . Exactly when the church began celebrating Christmas , however , is unclear . The first mention of a Nativity feast , scholars say , appears in the Philocalian calendar , a Roman document from A.D. 354 , which lists December 25 as the day of Jesus 's birth in Bethlehem of Judea . How the church arrived at December 25 , when the actual date of Christ 's birth was unknown , is a matter of conjecture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an intentional " Christianization " of Saturnalia and other pagan festivals . In the third and fourth centuries , the church in Rome found itself in fierce competition with popular pagan religions and mystery cults , most of them involving sun worship . From the middle of December through the first of January , Romans would engage in feasts and drunken revelry , paying homage to their gods and marking the winter solstice , when days began to lengthen . In A.D. 274 , Emperor Aurelian decreed December 25  --  the solstice on the Julian calendar  --  as natalis solis invicti ( " birth of the invincible sun " ) , a festival honoring the sun god Mithras . In designating December 25 as the date for their Nativity feast , says Restad of the University of Texas , Rome 's Christians hallenged paganism directly . " They also were able to invoke rich biblical symbolism that described Jesus as the " Sun of Righteousness " and God 's " true light , " sent to dispel darkness in the world . <p> A second view suggests that church leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inherited from ancient Judaism , that significant religious figures are born and die on the same day of the month . One prominent church tradition of the time held that Jesus died on March 25  --  the same date as his conception , according to the tradition . Were that the case , he would have been born nine months later , on December 25 . <p> Whatever their reasons , by assigning Christmas to late December , when people already were accustomed to celebrating , church leaders ensured widespread observance of the Savior 's birth . But in doing so , says Nissenbaum , the church also " tacitly agreed to allow the holiday to be celebrated more or less the way it had always been . " As one historian put it : " The pagan Romans became Christians  --  but the Saturnalia remained . " <p> Not surprisingly , the combination of the sacred and the profane made some church leaders uncomfortable . St. Gregory of Nazianzus , a fourth-century theologian and bishop of Constantinople , cautioned against " feasting to excess , dancing and crowning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an heavenly and not after an earthly manner . " But while there were always people for whom Christmas was a time of reverence rather than revelry , says Nissenbaum , " such people were in the minority . " Christmas , he says , " has always been an extremely difficult holiday to Christianize . " <p> The custom of honoring Jesus 's birth on December 25 quickly spread to the Eastern Church , which at one time observed Epiphany , January 6 , as a joint feast of the Nativity and the baptism of Jesus . Over the next 1,000 years , Christmas observance followed the expanding church from Egypt to northern Europe . In Scandinavia , it became entwined with a pagan midwinter feast known as yule . And by 1050 , the words Christes maesse ( " festival of Christ " ) had entered the English language . " From the 13th century on , " notes Restad , " nearly all Europe kept Jesus 's birth . " <p> Pagan pleasures . Indeed , they kept it much as the Romans had  --  in gluttonous feasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time , tried to rein in abuses of Christmas merriment but usually to little avail . In England , Restad notes , " celebrants devoted much of the season to pagan pleasures ... discouraged the remainder of the year . " Writing in 1725 , Anglican minister Henry Bourne said the way most people behaved at Christmas was " a scandal to religion and an encouraging of wickedness . " For many , he said , Christmas was " a pretense for drunkenness and rioting and wantonness . " England 's Puritans inveighed against keeping the holiday at all and succeeded for a while in having it banned . The Puritans , says Nissenbaum , " were correct when they pointed out  --  and they pointed it out often  --  that Christmas was nothing but a pagan festival covered with a Christian veneer . " <p> When Christmas landed on American shores , it fared little better . In colonial times , Christ 's birth was celebrated as a wildly social event  --  if it was celebrated at all . Virginians hunted and danced and feasted , while poor city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often begging food and drink at the homes of the well-to-do . Puritans in New England flatly refused to observe the holiday . <p> In some cities , says Nissenbaum , the rather benign English tradition of wassailing took on an increasingly menacing edge . In New York City and Philadelphia , bands of young men would march into houses of the wealthy , who were expected to proffer gifts of food and drink , sometimes in exchange for a song or an expression of goodwill . Often , says Nissenbaum , exchanges included " an explicit threat " as contained in one surviving wassail song : <p> We 've come here to claim our right ... <p> And if you do n't open up your door <p> We will lay you flat upon the floor . <p> Variations on the practice were common . In some cities , Christmas revelers would cross-dress or wear blackface as they went noisily from door to door . But in each case , says Nissenbaum , Christmas exchanges amounted to a passing of goods from master to servant , patron to apprentice and wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " when the social hierarchy itself was symbolically turned upside down . " Into the early 19th century , quiet family celebrations and gift exchanges among family members were largely unknown . <p> But Christmas in America was about to change . And when the changes came , they came quickly and quite deliberately . By the early 1820s , cities had mushroomed with industrialization and their Christmas celebrations had turned increasingly boisterous and sometimes violent . In 1828 , according to Nissenbaum , New York City organized its first professional police force in response to a violent Christmas riot . A concerned group of New York patricians that included Washington Irving and Clement Clarke Moore , author of A Visit From St. Nicholas , began a campaign to bring Christmas off the streets into the family circle . <p> Invented tradition . Moore 's classic poem , written in 1822 , provided the new mythology for this Christmas makeover . Moore 's St. Nick  --  far from being the creature of ancient Dutch folklore  --  was an " invented tradition , " says Nissenbaum , " made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore 's patrician audience , the midnight visitor who " looked like a peddler " would have evoked plebeian wassailers . But rather than demanding food and drink , this " jolly " and unthreatening visitor bore gifts for the children who , until then , had played a rather insignificant role in Christmas celebrations . <p> The poem quickly caught on , and newspapers soon began to editorialize about the " domestic enjoyments " of Christmas . Giving gifts to children and loved ones eventually supplanted the wassail as the mainstay of holiday celebration . And by the mid-19th century , what began in New York had spread throughout the country . Even some New England Presbyterians and Congregationalists , heirs to the Puritan legacy , became open celebrants of the Nativity . Christmas , says Nissenbaum , had been taken from the streets and domesticated . <p> Not surprisingly , the nation 's merchants were favorably disposed to this turn of events . The new tradition of Christmas gift giving created an instant retail bonanza , and merchants and advertisers soon began to promote the season nearly as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one historian observes , " department stores often outdid the churches in religious adornment and symbolism , with pipe organs , choirs , ... statues of saints and angels " in a manner that bathed " consumption in the reflected glory of Christianity . " Indeed , the holiday was on its way to becoming what Princeton University professor of religion Leigh Eric Schmidt called in his 1995 book , Consumer Rites , a " grand festival of consumption . " <p> By the early 20th century , stores had largely abandoned overtly religious motifs , says Restad . But they " continued to undergo marvelous alteration at holiday time , becoming strikingly ' other ' places . " As competition for the attention of holiday shoppers escalated , so did the Christmas displays . During the 1940s , Chicago 's Marshall Field &; Co. began to turn its huge department store into " a glittering fairyland " at Christmastime and each year came up with a secret new theme for its decorations . <p> Santa on parade . To expand holiday profits , many stores made Thanksgiving the official springboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1920 , Gimbels in Philadelphia organized the first Thanksgiving Day parade and featured Santa Claus as the main attraction . And in 1924 , both Hudson 's in Detroit and Macy 's in New York followed suit . <p> So vital was Thanksgiving in launching the Christmas season , says Restad , that commercial interests " conspired in resetting its date . " In 1939 , after years of Depression-deflated sales , the head of Ohio 's Federated Department Stores argued that by advancing the date of Thanksgiving one week , six days of shopping would be added . Convinced by his logic , says Restad , President Franklin Roosevelt moved the feast from November 30 to November 23 . And in 1941 , Congress set the annual date of Thanksgiving as the fourth Thursday in November  --  ensuring a four-week shopping season each year . The nation 's recognition of Christmas as a powerful economic force had reached its highest levels . <p> In the years since , the reinvented traditions of this modern American Christmas have permeated the culture through a potent combination of commerce and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films like Miracle on 34th Street have become rituals in themselves , homogenizing the Christmas experience for many Americans . And retailers have come to count on yuletide sales for up to 50 percent of their annual profits . The shopping season now pumps an estimated $37 billion into the nation 's economy  --  making the American Christmas larger than the gross national product of Ireland . <p> What many historians find most fascinating about the reinvention of Christmas is that its commercialization , now so frequently denounced , is what spawned the transformation in the first place . The " commercial forms " associated with Christmas and other holidays , says Schmidt of Princeton , " have become integral to their survival . " The consumer culture " shapes our holidays , " Schmidt says , " by taking in diverse , local traditions and creating relatively common ones . " To turn Christmas into a purely religious celebration now might cheer those who want to " take back Christmas , " he says . But such an observance " would lack the cultural resonance and impact of a holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that , adds Restad , " we probably would n't keep it as a society . " <p> Piety or profit . Yet there seems little danger of that happening . Christmas has far too powerful a grip on American culture : It is no more the church 's sole possession today than it was in ancient Rome . But given its long history of controversy and the unremitting tension between piety and profit in its observance , the " battle for Christmas " is all but certain to persist . <p> No matter how people choose to keep it  --  in the quiet of their homes or churches , or in the noisy cathedrals of suburban shopping malls  --  the arrival of Christmas , says Restad , prods celebrants once again to " confront our ideals " and to " examine our relationships with our families , our communities and our faith . " Adds Nissenbaum : Christmas rituals , whether old or new , sacred or secular , will serve as they always have to " transfigure our ordinary behavior " in ways that reveal " something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were or what we are becoming despite ourselves . " As thoughts return to a Bethlehem manger , the search begins again . And , at least for a season , it seems " peace on Earth , goodwill toward men " might be possible after all . POLL <p> Many Americans think Christmas is too commercial : Forty-eight percent say the Santa Claus tradition and gift giving detract from the religious celebration . <p> Forty-four percent of Americans think they spend too much money on gifts at Christmas ; 48 percent say they spend just the right amount . <p> The spiritual aspect of the holiday is important to many Americans : Eighty-two percent agree that " Christmas is a time of reflection for me .
