<p> Many plants produce active principles called phytochemicals . Some of these substances , such as garlic and onion , have long been used medicinally . At present , many phytochemicals are being examined for their potential to provide medicinal or health benefits , including the prevention or treatment of diseases . <p> It is hoped that once these substances are well understood , they can be extracted and then inserted into other foods . Such future foods are termed variously as " designer foods , " " prescriptive foods , " " pharma foods , " " medicinal foods , " " neutraceutical foods , " or " physiologically functional foods . " At present , there is no legal term or definition for such foods , and the line between foods and drugs is blurred . <p> Much information is lacking about phytochemical activity , and how to manipulate it in foods . The potential applications of phytochemicals has been encouraged by the National Cancer Institute . In 1989 , this agency funded $20 million for a five-year Designer Food Program . The first foods being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , citrus fruits , and umbelliferous vegetables ( such as parsley , carrot , and celery ) . <p> The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) have expressed interest in cooperating with the program by assembling a multi-disciplinary research group to assist with animal growth and reproduction studies . Close cooperation with the food industry is also anticipated . <p> Some of the phytochemicals that have been publicized are cancer-fighting ingredients such as indoles ( found in plants from the cabbage family ) to deactivate estrogens ; sterols ( from cucumbers ) to enhance cholesterol excretion from the body ; polyacetylenes ( from parsley ) to block the synthesis of prostaglandins and to buffer a potent carcinogen , benzopyrene ; quinones ( from rosemary ) to induce the body to produce detoxifying enzymes ; and isoflavones ( from legumes ) to deactivate cancer-gene enzymes . Other phytochemicals might stimulate the immune system ; reduce inflammation ; and help prevent blood clots , osteoporosis , and high blood pressure , among many other effects . <p> Although this approach may be promising , it is far from simple . Complexities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of substances at one level may be benign , at another level , hazardous . ( Examples are vitamin D , selenium , or licorice . ) Some substances contain both desirable and undesirable attributes . ( An example is dietary fat . ) In combination with other constituents present in foods , active principles may be strengthened or weakened . ( An example of the former is the iron in egg when combined with ascorbic acid ; the latter , iron and phytic acid in spinach . ) <p> Even manipulation of substances in foods by means of traditional plant-breeding techniques has provided some unforeseen problems . There was a near catastrophe in 1970 with the release of a new potato variety , named lenape . The potato had been bred especially for qualities that would make it suitable to produce potato chips . Shortly after its release , the lenape potato was pulled promptly from marketing channels . The variety was found to contain such a high glycoalkaloid content that the potato would have poisoned many consumers . Case Study : Tannins <p> A foretaste of the complexities likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single group of naturally occurring phytochemicals in foods , the tannins . In examining them , one is struck by nature 's inconsistencies and paradoxes that will need to be sorted out before designer foods can be used . <p> Tannins and tannic acid are astringent compounds widely distributed throughout the plant kingdom . The average individual may ingest several grams of tannins weekly from beverages such as regular and herb teas , coffee , cocoa , hot chocolate , red wine , cider , and apple brandy made from nonedible apples . Tannins are present in produce , too . Unripe persimmons are extremely high in tannins , which accounts for their puckering taste . Rhubarb , blackberries , pomegranates , and cranberries contain tannic acid and other astringent compounds . In some parts of the world , people chew tannin-containing betel nuts or drink kafir beer made from dark sorghum . <p> Soils contain tannins from decaying vegetable matter . Trees and products derived from trees contain tannins . Both acorns and bark from oak trees have appreciable amounts of tannins . <p> Oak casks have been used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would gain flavor from the tannins in the oak . An additional practice has developed of adding a wood extract from oak chips to brandy , a process termed " boise " that adjusts the tannin level . The federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms decides on a case-by-case basis the safety of a particular infusion of oak chips in brandy . Processors are not required to indicate the presence of the added wood extract in the brandy if the level does not exceed 2.5% by volume . <p> Associated With Cancer . Early investigations indicted tannins as carcinogens . The National Cancer Institute funded Dr. Julia F. Morton , Director of the Morton Collectanea at the University of Miami , to conduct a search for the causes of esophageal cancer . Morton 's investigations , from the mid-1960s to mid-1970s , led her through the swamps of South Carolina , to native markets in Curacao and Venezuela , and then to Singapore where she examined the dietary habits of Chinese and Japanese populations . In all these areas of high esophageal cancer rates Morton found one common denominator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the leaves of wax myrtle and sweet gum , and roots of marsh rosemary , were being used in South Carolina to treat diarrhea and other health ailments . All were high in tannins . Infusions of these plants , injected in rats , induced cancer . The medicinal use of these plants was an outgrowth of the blockage of Charleston , South Carolina , during the Civil War . Cut off from European drug importation , people were forced to turn to local medicines . Teas from the high-tannin plants were administered , especially to the military , against diarrhea and dysentery . The teas were used purposefully , sparingly , and for limited periods . However , by the 1960s Morton found that many people in the low country of South Carolina , especially among the poor , were drinking large amounts of these teas as daily beverages . The heavy consumption led to a high incidence of esophageal cancer in the area . <p> Morton also found high tannin levels in dry red wine and some teas . After studying consumption patterns around the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red wine consumption showed high rates of gastric cancer as well as esophageal cancer . <p> Conflicting Evidence . Subsequent to Morton 's investigations , there have been additional findings about tannins . Some appear to contradict hers , and others are puzzling . The finds demonstrate the complex challenge investigators of phytochemicals face . <p> Tannin is a general term for a large group of heterogeneous phenolic compounds that precipitate proteins . There is a great deal of structural variety even among those tannins derived from a single source . Tannins are complex , difficult to characterize , and also difficult to purify . <p> In general , there are two broad classifications of tannins : the hydrolyzable ones ( those that can be split ) , and the condensed tannins ( such as catechins in tea ) . Tannates are insoluble ; tannin and tannic acid , soluble . It is thought that most of the compounds loosely classified as tannins are probably not carcinogens . <p> In 1970 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) noted that " early studies on commercial tannins showed hepatoxicity damaging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the evaluation of food grade material . " 1 WHO reported that " some tannins occurring in natural foodstuffs , such as tea and coffee , are not toxic ...... <p> In 1976 , the FDA requested a review of the health aspects of tannic acid , because " investigators of the toxicity of tannic acid seldom employ identical substances and often fail to identify the substance adequately . These practices make comparing experimental results difficult . " <p> The review , completed the following year by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology , concluded that " there is no evidence of a clear and present danger " from current use of dietary tannic acid as a food ingredient . However , additional studies were recommended regarding absorption of dietary tannic acid by individuals with gastrointestinal disorders . <p> Emerging Benefits . The tannins in tea are catechins ( polyphenolic chemicals ) . Tea is processed into three types : green , black , and oolong . Green tea , commonly drunk in the East , is the richest in catechins . The tannins and other compounds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fermented and baked to increase flavor . <p> Many studies have shown that tea drinking can inhibit the absorption of minerals such as calcium , iron , and others . However , in some cases this feature might be beneficial . For example , the tannins in tea could inhibit the undesirable absorption of aluminum in the intestinal tract . <p> Tea significantly inhibits absorption of non-heme iron ( from plants ) by 41% to 95% in both normal and iron-deficient individuals . At present , tea 's ability to inhibit absorption of these nutrients is poorly understood . Possibly , the tannins form complexes that make the iron unavailable for intestinal absorption . Tannin can form a tight bond , known as a chelate , that binds protein . <p> In recent years , tannins have undergone further scrutiny . Some findings show surprising beneficial effects . For example , studies have shown that catechins , the tannins in tea , have an antioxidant property . In rat studies , catechins lowered cholesterol and blood pressure . Catechins , among other constituents in tea , were found capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many nitrosamine compounds are carcinogenic . Other studies suggest that catechins might reduce gastrointestinal cancer and strengthen the immune system . In animal studies , some catechins appear to have anti-mutagenic as well as anti-carcinogenic properties . <p> Tannic acid has been found to possess a quality that may prevent tooth decay . A study , conducted with tannin-containing Nigerian chewing sticks , showed an anti-cariogenic property ( against tooth decay ) . Extracts of the stick were combined with known plaque-causing bacteria . Mixtures were added to saliva-coated specimens of tooth enamel . Within an hour , the tannin extracts destroyed up to 85% of the cavity-causing bacteria . <p> Tannins in chocolate may also protect teeth against plaque . However , this benefit might be offset by sweeteners present in chocolate products . Many sweeteners promote growth of undesirable bacteria that contribute to plaque formation . <p> Recently , an anti-carcinogenic substance has been identified in green tea . Also , the catechins in tea showed several surprising beneficial effects . They decreased , for example , total plasma cholesterol and increased HDL cholesterol . Tea catechins increased fecal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The catechins in green tea might also be able to lower blood pressure . <p> In recent years , the tannins in red wine have also undergone further scrutiny , and have been found to have specific actions that might be beneficial . Resveratrol , a constituent in red grapes and red wine , may lower cholesterol . It has been suggested that moderate red wine consumption might protect against heart disease . However , the amount of resveratrol in red grapes may vary a hundred-fold , and the present winemaking techniques destroy this phytochemical . Challenges Ahead <p> The complexities of the tannins will be encountered with other phytochemicals as they are examined in detail . Foods contain many constituents , sometimes numbering in the hundreds . Even if phytochemicals are isolated , purified , and studied individually , their effectiveness may depend on working in tandem with other constituents . These factors are challenges to the researchers . <p> Designer foods present a different set of challenges for the FDA . Current regulations act as deterrents to the development of designer foods because such foods do not fit neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no appropriate protocols exist for their review and approval . <p> Elsewhere , notably in Europe and Japan , ongoing research with phytochemicals has been spurred by conviction that natural substances have great potential as preventive and therapeutic health aids . The research is being conducted without hobbling restrictions . <p> Among the many reforms of the Nutritional Labeling and Education Act ( NLEA ) a limited number of nutrients and health claims will be allowed on food labels . The NLEA provides no mechanism to permit health claims for products such as designer foods . <p> To modify regulations would involve basic changes in several of the FDA 's long-held policies . For many years , the agency would not allow any health claims to be made for foods or food components . These constraints were loosened somewhat because of an overwhelming number of clinical studies demonstrating that specific nutrients could benefit a range of health problems and help to prevent disease . Recent examples of the evidence include the use of beta carotene to prevent lung cancer ; vitamin B(3) ( niacin ) to prevent recurrent heart attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression ; vitamin A to treat measles ; magnesium to treat hypertension ; calcium to reduce osteoporosis and hypertension ; and antioxidants to reduce damage from heart attacks . <p> For years , the FDA has given assurances that the American public is well fed . Yet repeatedly , clinical studies have shown that various segments of the population experience increased health risk with marginal or gross deficiencies of certain nutrients . <p> The FDA has also continued to deny the value of nutritional supplementation . Yet , an increasing number of clinical studies have demonstrated the benefits of nutritional supplementation , and have recommended that they be used . Until the agency is willing to accept the mounting evidence , it will be unable to accept the idea that designer foods , with their concentration of phytochemicals , is an idea worthy of consideration . <p> <p> 1 . Among other industrial applications , tannins are used in dyeing , manufacturing ink , sizing paper and silk , printing fabrics , manufacturing imitation horn and tortoise shell , tanning hides , and in photography and chemistry . The Occupational Safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I as " confirmed carcinogenic substances . " Exposure to tannins is to be severely regulated . However , the toxicity of tannins , based on routes of administration that are not oral ( such as exposures to skin or lungs ) is not considered relevant to safe food use . <p> By Beatrice Trum Hunter <p> <p> Mrs. Hunter is the food editor of Consumers ' Research . <p> OTHER USES FOR TANNIN <p> In addition to tannins naturally present in foods and beverages , tannic acid has been used by American food processors since 1899 . Tannic acid is permitted as an agent for refining animal fats under meat inspection regulations , but must be eliminated during the manufacturing process . <p> Tannin is regulated as a boiler water additive to prepare steam that comes in contact with food . Tannin is used as a clarifying agent in brewing beer and in the wine industry . Tannic acid is used as a natural flavor extractive , and is classified by the FDA as GRAS ( Generally Recognized as Safe ) . Tannic acid is used as a flavoring agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brandy , maple , and nut . Tannic acid may be added to frozen dairy desserts and mixes ; soft and hard candies ; baked goods and baking mixes ; gelatins , puddings , and fillings ; meat products ; and alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages . <p> ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF TANNINS <p> Tannins have been found to have some beneficial agricultural applications . Much of the protein consumed by cows in feed breaks down rapidly in the animal 's first stomach ( the rumen ) instead of being utilized in the small intestine . Tannins may help make more efficient use of feed . Tannins , present in some forage legumes , can bind the protein in the feed and allow it to break down and release its amino acids in the small intestine . There , they can be well utilized . <p> Tannins are useful to prevent bloat in animals , caused by legumes fed as green forage . Bloat is a build-up of gas in the cow 's rumen caused by bacteria . The animal swells up . Severe cases can result in cardiac arrest or suffocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-bloating aids . The tannins help cows to digest their feed more slowly and prevent bloat . Birdsfoot trefoil , a forage legume , has been found to be ideal , with just the right amount of tannins . By means of genetic engineering , efforts are now made to introduce anti-bloating tannins into other forage crops such as alfalfa . <p> Tannic acid has been found useful in chemically altering house dust , pollen , and dust mite antigens , to make these substances less offensive to allergic sufferers , especially asthmatics . In experiments , a 3% tannic acid solution , sprayed on carpets and upholstery , dramatically reduced levels of the primary cat allergen ( a fine coating of protein in cat hair ) . Tannic acid treatment could bring relief from allergic reactions in cat-sensitive people by treating a house in which a cat resides before an allergic individual plans to visit . <p>
