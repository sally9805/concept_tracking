Nest Entertainment lives up to its name with a $35 million animated film designed to " feed and nurture the young " and win the approval of the American family . <p> The ancient castle is decked with banners . Guests arrive from distant lands , stepping from their coaches onto the rolled-out red carpet , where they are greeted by a prince , a princely frog , and the one whose debut they 've come to see  --  the princess . <p> The coaches  --  luxury buses arriving from the nearby Cannes Film Festival  --  are part of an exquisitely planned celebration of The Swan Princess , a full-length , classically animated fairy tale in the tradition and quality of Walt Disney 's Beauty and the Beast . But for Matt Mazer and Rick Rich , the tuxedoed visionaries who , independently of any studio , produced the $35 million film , tonight is much more than a fairy tale  --  it is a dream come true . <p> That dream began in 1986 when Rich , a director of animated feature films at Wait Disney Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own animation studio in Burbank and began producing half-hour religious and historical videos for children . <p> " From the day we started , everyone knew that our goal was to do a feature , " says Rich , who , like most of his crew , had been trained at Disney in the studio 's classic animation style . Working with writer Brian Nissen , Rich developed a script called " Rabbit Hill , " but later decided that a fairy tale would make a better motion picture debut . " Swan Lake , " a German folk tale about an evil sorcerer who turns a princess into a swan , had never been done as a feature film . The tale appealed to Rich , not only because it is a love story and a classic fairy tale , but also because of the visual possibilities of the princess ' nightly metamorphosis . <p> While continuing to work on the animated videos , Rich and Nissen developed and wrote 12 different drafts of the " Swan Lake " screenplay . The major studios in Hollywood were excited and intrigued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk of financing it . The response was always the same : " We love the story , but we think Disney 's the only company that can make and sell animated features . " <p> Finally , in March 1992 , Jared Brown and Seldon Young , who had been financing the half-hour " edutainment " videos , stepped forward and committed the $35 million needed to produce and market what would later be called The Swan Princess . Brown , referring to the dogged persistence of Rich and his team , explained simply , " I did n't want to miss the party . " <p> A holding company was created  --  Nest Entertainment  --  that allowed Rich Animation Studios , Family Entertainment ( which was distributing the videos ) , and a cassette duplicating company to be combined under one banner . With a separate infusion of capital from Prudential Equity Investors a year later , Nest Entertainment was now positioned to be a major producer of animated feature films . <p> However , an important ingredient was still missing . Who would take the film to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotional partners , enlist a distributor who could handle the film with the same passion and care as its Nest-building creators ? <p> While talking to financiers , Rich had met an executive at Goldcrest Films and Television whose experience was custom-made for the job . Matt Mazer had already developed a successful marketing and promotional campaign for a non-Disney animated film , All Dogs Go To Heaven , and before that had spent three years as a marketing executive at Disney itself , where his accomplishments included setting up long-term promotional partners ( such as McDonald 's , Sony , and Lipton ) for animated and live-action films . When Goldcrest eventually said no to Swan , Mazer said yes and joined Nest Entertainment as executive vice president . <p> Rich Animation Studios then went through a metamorphosis of its own , growing from 28 employees to 265 in less than two years . The studio first hired storyboard artists to visualize the script , then hired animators to draw the different characters and layout artists to create the lush backgrounds of forest , lake , and castle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films had recently completed production , so there was an unusually large talent pool from which to draw . <p> However , there were growing pains as well . Different animators brought with them different styles of working , which sometimes did n't blend . Nevertheless , thanks to the studio 's short-term projects  --  eight to nine half-hour videos a year  --  new employees could cut their teeth on video animation , learning to work together as a cohesive team before moving on to the feature film . <p> The working atmosphere at Nest was important to Rich , who was eager to avoid the kind of bureaucracy and politics common at larger film studios . Thus , the third floor offices were designed as a loop , with Rich 's office in the middle of all the animators . Persons wishing to meet with him simply had to sign their names on the clipboard outside his office for a same-day appointment . <p> " Respect is always totally earned , " says Rich , a father of six , " and when it 's earned , people will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , and strangely enough , there 's usually a handful of people already here . " <p> Over the past two years , the work-in-progress film has been screened many times for the entire staff , thus giving each member of the company a sense of pride and ownership  --  and often resulting in new ideas and jokes to improve the film . " Rick will take a good gag from anybody , " says Mazer . " Even me . " <p> It was Mazer 's idea to have bad-guy Rothbart , who is " voiced " by the gruffly charming actor Jack Palance , do one-armed pushups in one of the film 's flashy , Broadway-style musical numbers  --  just as Palance had done at the 1992 Oscars telecast . Kids in the audience may miss the joke , says Mazer , but animation at its best appeals not only to children , but to the parents and grandparents who pay for the tickets . <p> A typical day for Mazer begins at dawn , although it often starts in mid-air : waking up on a " red-eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta , or Boston . <p> When at home , Mazer starts his phone calls at 6:00 a.m.  --  to the British publisher of Nest 's children 's books , to the Japanese distributor releasing Swan in 1995 , to the New York media agency that is buying TV ads that wo n't run for another six months . By 7:00 a.m. , Mazer has also spoken to a Manhattan printer about the movie posters , to a promotions company about in-store displays for retailers , and to a Washington , D.C. , research firm about audience reactions to the latest test screening . <p> At 7:00 , Mazer gets a fax from Don Barrett , his senior vice president of marketing , with reminders for the day , a summary of the morning 's entertainment news , and a joke  --  in case Mazer already needs cheering . After calling Rick Rich to plan the day , Mazer heads off to an 8:00 breakfast  --  this time with Turner Home Video , which will release the Swan video next fall . Later , he heads for the office , returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All kinds of " great stuff " is awaiting Mazer 's approval at his Burbank office : artwork , videos , and various products from the film 's 90-odd agencies and licensees . <p> " The most fun I had this week was looking at these cute little shoes made by Angel-ettes ; I ran around for half an hour showing them to everybody . " Mazer brings in a pair , and they are , in fact , adorable  --  down to the very sole , where the beautiful Princess and the Swan logo are built right into the tread . " Even though they only come in kids ' sizes , everybody wants a pair , " says Mazer , sounding a bit like a kid himself . <p> The kind of collaboration that takes place inside the company has extended outside as well . When it came time to design the Princess ' bridal gown for the final sequence ( unlike the ballet Swan Lake , this movie has a happy ending ) , Rich and Mazer let the Tyco toy company give its opinions , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed that the people at the toy company probably knew what little girls wanted to see in a bridal gown a lot better than we did , " says Mazer . <p> Nonetheless , merchandising , though important , is always secondary to the film itself , says Mazer . " It 's not about merchandise ; it 's about fantasy . When I was a kid , we had Davy Crockett stuff ; I had the hat with the clip-on tail . It made it all the more fun and all the more real because you identified with the characters . The merchandise validates the experience and extends the fantasy , but the experience is going to the movie . " <p> " We named the company Nest because , by definition , ' nest ' is a sanctuary , a place where you feed and nurture the young , " says president and CEO Stephen Griffin , who has dropped in today from Nest 's headquarters . " We want the Nest logo to be a seal of approval by the American family , so that when they sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or they open up a coloring book or listen to a musical cassette , parents will know that this is entertainment they can trust and enjoy . " <p> As the last of the 220,000 animation cels are painted and photographed , and the voices of Jack Palance , John Cleese , Sandy Duncan , and Steven Wright are mixed with the last-minute sound effects , what is Rick Rich most proud of ? <p> " I really feel we have a chance to open up the ' whole animation industry , " he says from his corner office , with its wide views of the San Gabriel Mountains . " These last two years have been magical . Everyone senses that this is probably the best animated film that 's ever been done outside of Disney . And I think that will be our greatest success , to open up the field , to show that someone else can do it . " <p> New Line Cinema 's Thanksgiving release of The Swan Princess is the culmination of years of hard work , but is only the beginning for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animated feature every 12 to 18 months . <p> " The magic and wonder of going into a big , dark theater with your parent or grandparent and sitting down with a whole bunch of other kids and seeing a wonderful animated movie  --  that whole special time together is part of a cultural continuum that started in 1937 with Disney 's Snow White , and it is truly one of the last , traditional , shared family entertainment experiences available , " Mazer says . <p> " Parents tell us in research that they want their kids to remain kids just a little bit longer . Classic animated pictures are experiences that allow kids to stay kids and parents to be kids and everybody to have a good time . . . together .
