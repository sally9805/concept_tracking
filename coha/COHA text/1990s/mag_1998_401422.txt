Above all , we should realize that the effort toward conservation is essentially a democratic movement . It is entirely in our power as a nation to preserve large tracts of wilderness ... and to preserve the game so that it shall continue to exist for the benefit of all lovers of nature , and to give reasonable opportunities for the exercise of the skill of the hunter , whether he is or is not a man of means. - THEODORE ROOSEVELT // Unlike almost every other place on earth , the United States of America has always been notable for its hunting tradition . Ever since Europeans first arrived on this continent , access to land and game has been restricted only by necessary regulation , not by status or wealth . But times change . And just as the frontier vanished a century ago , we now may be witnessing the disappearance of our tradition of hunting access . The most serious concern is that we are moving toward a " European system " of hunting . Such a system would be carried out exclusively on private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact the entire structure of wildlife conservation and management , which for the last 100 years has extremely successfully operated on the basis that wildlife has no monetary value beyond that which the government might charge for licenses or permits to hunt it . Before we can say that we are truly moving toward a European system-or even something else entirely-we first must know how large the access issue is . Are there steps the government can take to preserve and even expand access ? How should hunters think about access , not just in terms of how it fits into hunting but how it fits into our total conservation system ? Why They Stay Home Every five years the U.S. Department of the Interior 's Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Department of Commerce 's Bureau of the Census join to produce the National Survey of Fishing , Hunting , and Wildlife-Associated Recreation . The latest National Survey was conducted in 1996 , and it gives some notion of how important hunting access may be .

This causes some hunters to purchase , lease , or otherwise get exclusive hunting rights to private land . Photograph Pine-woods bowhunter : Leasing is a long-standing , accepted method of hunting access in the South . // When it came to the reasons why hunters did not hunt as much as they would have liked in 1996 , access was one of the principal ones . According to the National Survey , a belief that there was not enough access dissuaded more hunters than did the beliefs that there was not enough game , that seasons were too short , that bag limits were too small , or that they ran the risk of being injured . It was surpassed only by family responsibilities , not enough time or money , bad weather , and bad health . Clearly , believing that access exists is the first step to finding it . As far as finding access , the National Survey showed that in 1996 more than 362 million acres , an area almost as big as Alaska , were privately owned or leased for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 percent increase over the amount of land hunters owned or leased in 1991 , when the previous National Survey had been taken . The cost of hunting land in 1996 was nearly $3.2 billion , or more than 2 times what was spent in the same year on all hunting and fishing licenses , stamps , tags , and permits combined . And in 1996 , according to the National Survey , hunters spent close to 200 million hunter-days on private land , compared to only 77 million hunter-days on public land . It would seem obvious that the demand for private-land hunting is at an unprecedented high . But , compared to 1991 figures , the hunter-day figures for public-land hunting went up 19 percent , compared to only an 11 percent increase for private land . What this may suggest is that hunters have turned more to public land because of reduced access to private land , and that hunters on private land may have hunted longer to get more out of their investment . One thing it unquestionably proves is that whatever the state of access , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and disturbing , exception that will be looked at later ) . A Place for a Price The intensity of the desire for hunting access is seen in the soaring price of duck land in the South . " The value of land to duck hunters , who are willing to pay $2,000 an acre or more , is even making it impossible for farmers to buy land anymore , " says avid Memphis duck hunter Tom Matthews , president of Avery Outdoors , Inc. ( a waterfowling equipment manufacturer ) . Matthews reports that one duck blind on a club near Stuttgart , Arkansas , went for a dumbfounding $20,000 for last year 's two-month season . Such astronomical prices for access could lead to the assumption that private land holds the best duck hunting , when it may hold nothing more than the promise of it . Matthews notes that some of the finest waterfowling last season was on public land . The Bayou Meto management area in Arkansas , for example , is said to have had far better hunting than did most high-dollar private duck clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds had not yet found it . Soon enough , though , everyone with a camo cap and a duck boat was fighting to get on the water . Curiously , however , as long as there appeared to be enough ducks for everyone , the crowds found ways to hunt together . Complete strangers were tying up their boats in the same hole and shooting side by side , sharing the birds equitably without even a single lawyer getting involved . In the Northeast , though , lawyers may only have succeeded in exacerbating a continuing access problem . The Legal Lockout The overwhelming threat to access in the Northeast , as in so many other places in the country , is the irreversible loss of land due to subdivision . But there is also the problem caused by the purchases of large " trophy " estates by affluent newcomers for whom hunting may be a farfrom-correct activity . Besides locking away land once open to hunting , newcomers can often further restrict access bv the attitudes they bring-attitudes that may lead to the passage of ordinances that they feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discharge of a firearm within municipal boundaries , or require hunters to obtain written permission before going onto private property . Photograph Some landowners bar access to public lands by gating their property . // While the latter may at first appear innocuous enough , it is actually quite insidious and extremely chilling . The landowner who was once willing to grant permission with a simple nod or a " yep " now has to execute a written , legal document stating that the hunter is allowed to hunt on the landowner 's property . In the mind of the landowner , who sees all those ads for all those personal-injury lawyers on TV , this creates the very real concern that he could end up having his overall-covered butt sued to ribbons if anyone is ever hurt on his land , often leaving hunters in limbo , or as one Vermont hunter put it to me , " The landowner wo n't say I ca n't hunt , but wo n't say I can , either . " One solution would be to pass laws that indemnify the landowner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , something the National Rifle Association , for one , has been advocating for almost two decades . The Landmaker As access in the Northeast clearly shrinks-fees are starting to be demanded even on Maine 's vast paperand timber-company holdings , where access was once free-a number of states are moving to create new access to try to slow the trend . In New York , state bonds have been issued to purchase large parcels of land on which hunting may be allowed . And in purportedly arch-liberal , anti-gun Massachusetts , an even more direct approach has been taken by requiring all hunters , anglers , and trappers in the state to purchase an annual $5 stamp , the funds from which are earmarked for the purchase of so-called wildlands , which are then added to the state 's wildlife management areas . Since 1991 the stamp has raised $1.5 million that has been used to purchase 11,500 acres ( one-eighth of the state 's management areas ) that are open and free of charge to any hunter . Photograph South Dakota deer hunter : Many Midwestern and Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches to try to plug the hole in the access dike . In 1996 the Illinois Department of Natural Resources started its Illinois Access Outdoors Program , which tries to match hunters ( as well as anglers and other outdoor recreationists ) with the owners of land best suited to the hunters ' wants . The program takes a profile of a hunter-the game he is after , how he wants to hunt , what kind of services he would like to have provided , how much ( if anything ) he is willing to pay for access , etc. - and matches him as closely as possible to one of the over 300 properties , covering 80,000 acres of private land , enrolled in the program . Aside from any fee , the landowner benefits by having the state screen potential hunters before they knock on his door ; and he may also receive professional game-management or habitat-improvement services from the state . To the west , states such as South Dakota have had for some time walk-in-only areas that allow access to private land . Montana has a 7.5-million-acre Block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit onto their land , while Arizona employs a variety of programs to maintain access to some 13 million acres of ranch land . Even in Texas , where fee hunting is a given , the state offers a number of hunting opportunities to help offset the spiraling costs of leases . These may include special draw hunts for trophy deer ; a $40 Annual Public Hunting Permit that opens up 1.4 million acres of land to a hunter , and to any child under 17 who accompanies him ; more than 100 dovehunting fields leased by the state near urban areas ; and some 9 million private acres where population-reduction hunts for deer are necessary . All of the above programs work to some extent , but none is without its critics , or its failings . The Perils of Privatization Back in the Midwest , one of the inherent weaknesses of public leasing of hunting land can be seen in Michigan . With free access available on vast tracts of federal , state , and private timber-company land in its northern and Upper Peninsula regions and the largest number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan still has access problems in the south , where most of the land is privately held . For 20 years the Michigan Department of Natural Resources has tried to address this situation by using license revenues to lease hunting access . Today some 225 properties , totaling 40,000 acres , are being leased by the state . Hunters simply have to sign in to get onto a property , and except for certain days , such as pheasant or deer openers , there appears to be little competition with other hunters for these lands . Photograph Liability concerns have shut out hunters . // The amount of land in this program , though , is significantly down from previous years , because the better the habitat , the more likely the land will be leased away by private hunters at the end of the typical three-year access contract . The hunters got to know the land under the program and appreciated what they saw . In Wisconsin and Missouri the most productive deer habitat is on private land , but the tradition there has long been one of free access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in financial straits , they will sell off so-called rough land , which provides excellent shelter but little feed for deer . The new hunter-owners are in turn much more restrictive than the farmers were about the number of other hunters they will then allow on the property . Contrary to the perceptions of some , hunters are more likely to under-hunt a property they own or control than " shoot it out . " The first thing many hunters do when they buy a property is to begin " a Save-the-Deer ' program , " says Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources deer biologist Keith McCaffery . As a rule they tend to distrust the estimates biologists like McCaffery give about game densities , assuming them to be far too optimistic , and are usually poor judges themselves about how much game is on their property , seeing far less than there actually is . Under-hunting , then , can have severe social repercussions , as deer , especially , overpopulate and spill out of these newly minted refuges ( " They do n't die unless you shoot them " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another deer biologist I spoke with ) and start trampling through surrounding cropfields , tearing up the gardens and shrubs of rural homeowners , and running in front of cars . Soon enough the locals , who may now be prohibited from hunting land they once had free access to , begin to consider the deer to be pests ( with 20 million whitetails at large , nobody seems to shed many tears anymore over the death of Bambi 's mom ) and the hunter who harbors them a nuisance . The ill will that can be created by this unintended consequence of more restrictive access only makes the management job of state wildlife departments that much harder . Faceless Places Photograph Waiting for ducks : Hunting clubs are traditional avenues to access in many regions . // In the West , increasing fees for , and restrictions on , hunting private land are not nearly so much of a concern as is the gaining of enough access to public lands . Of the 700 million acres of public land ( most of which can be hunted ) , the bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times Mirror Magazines pamphlet " Locked Out , " a General Accounting Office study found that some 50.4 million acres lack proper public access . This represents about 14 percent of the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land in the lower 48 states , or an area roughly the size of Nebraska . In some cases it is the government itself that has blocked access , while in others the government may need to act to keep it open . A controversial example of the government blocking access can be seen in the sprawling and inhospitable deserts of California . Under the federal government 's California Desert Protection Act of 1994 , over a quarter-million acres of wilderness were created . Up until then the primary visitors to these areas had been hunters drawn by rabbits , quail , chukar , doves , mule deer , and even bighorn sheep ; and roads ran throughout them . By declaring these areas " wilderness , " ( this despite the fact that roadlessness is a defining characteristic of a wilderness ) , all vehicular travel , including bicycling , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed today , so do n't forget to slip that 50-gallon drum of water into your pack when you hike in to hunt . Far more widespread than this sort of blocked access , though , is that carried out on property that lies in the way of public land . Too often , hunters who have for years taken a road that is a public right of way across private land to reach federal or state land beyond will suddenly find that road posted or even gated , barring them from their hunting area . Sometimes this is the result of a new owner who does not want anyone crossing his property . Or it may be the work of a guide-outfitter who has leased the hunting rights to the private property because it adjoins large sections of public land and who wants to keep anyone else out of " his " territory . Or maybe it has been done by hunters who will deliberately " mis-sign " an area to convince other hunters that they can not hunt there . Photograph Elk guide packs out the game in Montana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , much of it lacks proper access . // The Times Mirror pamphlet suggests several courses of action that the government can take to unblock access . One is to document that legal access across private land already exists , which is believed to be the case in 80 percent of blocked land . This , though , is a very time-consuming process , especially if landowners choose to dispute the government 's claims in court . The second is for government agencies to enhance access by purchasing easements with public funds . The obvious difficulty here is one of expense . The third solution would be for the government , when it resells property it has obtained through defaults on federal loans , to place an easement on that property for access to public land . This , of course , would make the property harder to resell and would likely affect only a small portion of land blocking access . Free to All . or to the Highest Bidder ? The underlying ideologies on how to go about obtaining hunting access seem to tend toward two very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public to have the widest possible access to public hunting lands , they definitely diverge over what one would characterize as the " use of incentives " for providing hunting on private lands , and what the other would decry as the " commercialization of hunting . " Examples of the diverging philosophies : According to Safari Club International 's ( SCI ) executive director , Rudy Rosen , " better decisions about protecting wildlife habitat are made when wildlife has a direct monetary value to that decision maker . " Conversely , Jim Posewitz , president of Orion-The Hunters Institute , believes that creating " a new class struggle by imposing fees without sharing hunting opportunity with quality , ethical hunters who can not afford fees , sets a dangerous precedent . " Both poles , when taken to extremes that neither SCI nor Orion probably intends for them to go , are fraught with assumptions , many of which seem difficult to support . It seems clear , for example , that wildlife and habitat can only be managed on a longterm , sustained-yield basis on a scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . It requires a government wildlife service , free of ties to the market , to manage ( ideally ) for the whole of the environment , and not just for those portions that promise the greatest financial return . Having hunted in the actual European system , where game is entirely commercialized and bountiful , I found a habitat intensely manipulated for the benefit of that game , and eerily lacking in the wildness that one associates with real hunting : No predators , but no small animals , either ; no uncultivated vegetation , including the forests ; and somehow , worst of all , no bird song . If that 's the free market , I 'll pass , no matter how big the stags grow . The worst nightmares of those who speak of " class struggle , " on the other hand , is that the charging of access fees will bar large numbers of people from hunting . In a study of the " Factors Influencing Land Access Selection by Hunters in Alabama , " published in the Transactions of the Fifty-fourth North American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fee-hunting system is most highly developed in the southcentral United States . After surveying nearly 2,000 resident and nonresident Alabama hunters , the researchers concluded that the fee-hunting system ( in Alabama anyway ) was " not excluding individuals from the hunting experience , " nor was it " decreasing the hunter 's commitment to or participation in hunting " or his " commitment/interest in wildlife . " To be sure , Alabama has had a long time to adapt to a fee-hunting system ; but there is no reason to believe that hunters ( at least the ones truly dedicated to hunting ) in other regions would not also be able to . Numbers from the most recent National Survey seem to bear this out . Between 1991 and 1996 the number of hunters pursuing big game , migratory birds , and varmints increased by 5 percent , 2 percent , and 8 percent , respectively , while hunter-days went up 20 percent , 19 percent , and 27 percent . These percentages are noteworthy because they reflect the levels of commitment hunters have toward some of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting . Most hunters , though , begin with a far less demanding kind of hunting , and that is where , as I indicated earlier , a definite and disturbing decline is taking place . The End of the Road ? The majority of those who become committed hunters do so by first hunting small game . Hunting rabbits and squirrels has been the natural gateway through which the young , those of limited means , and minorities have passed on the way to more intense forms of hunting . The attraction of small-game hunting has been that it is inexpensive ( a box of .22s remains one of life 's genuine bargains ) , does not demand a great deal of time , and has been , up till now , readily accessed . In short , it has always been easy and inviting . Yet amid increases in other forms of hunting , small-game recorded a 9 percent decline in hunters in the National Survey and a 3 percent drop in hunter-days , along with a significant shift from private to public lands . This may be where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , is beginning to have its most serious impact . Committed hunters , it 's clear , will tolerate fees or roadblocks ( literally ) or even crowds , as long as they believe that at the end of the day they will get a fair shot , as it were , at the game . To become a dedicated hunter , though , one has to begin to hunt . And the more difficult it becomes to do that , the fewer hunters there will in time be , and the less influence they will have on the legislation and the policies that directly affect hunting , and in the long run , on the environment itself . Photograph Checking for sharptails in North Dakota : Obtaining permission to hunt on private I // Daily , thousands of acres of wildlife habitat are lost , sometimes forever , due to development . The benefits a landowner may receive by providing hunting access can be an effective inducement for slowing such loss . Still , this country 's history makes it likely that market forces will ultimately be the strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunters , therefore , are obligated to see to it that those forces are not allowed to become the sole determinant . The free market alone will never provide all the access needed , such as for small-game hunting , because there 's not likely to be enough profit in all of it . Yet neither will any sort of " command-and-control " approach by government . What will be needed will be a carefully and artfully monitored blending of both monetary incentives and public programs . WHEN THEODORE ROOSEVELT SPOKE ABOUT access and hunting , he meant far more . He was also talking about nothing less than the conservation of some of the last great stretches of wild land , and species of wild animals , on earth . Photograph is still often a matter of being courteous to the owner and respecting his property . // A century later we have succeeded in this country , to a degree almost unique in the world , in doing just that , and have done so , even more amazingly , democratically .

Yet if it is possible in a century from now to look around and see much that still remains , and some that might even be improved , then no small measure of credit will belong to our long-standing system of public wildlife management , licensed hunting , and widespread , essentially nonprofit , and fairly distributed hunting access .

Model thin and shielded from the cold by only a vintage Adidas warm-up jacket , she leans into the icy wind that seems to hurl cars downtown and squints at the dreary commerce .

As always , she winces at the gap-toothed sign with its missing a 's in s l v tion . An NYU sophomore on a track and cross-country scholarship , she has run through all kinds of neighborhoods , good and bad , but none as unsettling as this shabby bit of midtown fringe , where every endeavor feels dwarfed and mocked by the value of the real estate beneath it . As an antidote to the creepiness as much as the cold , Pena slips a chocolate malt ball into her mouth and picks up her already brisk pace . From Third on , the start of Midtown proper , there are no more random tenements or one-off businesses . There are only franchises and banks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block , her bloodred jacket and short glistening black hair are the only colors . Thanks to the hotels , Lexington , at least , is well lit , and on the far corner is the glowing entrance to the IRT . When the signal turns , Pena bounds across the street and down the greasy steps , and after an expertly timed swipe of her Metrocard , pushes through the turnstile like a finish line . She barely has time to throw away her used-up card before a southbound 6 train fills the station , and when she climbs up onto Bleecker , she 's so glad to be downtown , the air feels ten degrees warmer and for the first time in what seems like hours , she is aware of the night sky . Seeing that she has fifteen minutes to spare , she makes a quick detour to Tower Records , where she grabs the latest No Doubt CD for Moreal and the latest Britney for Consuela , and after enduring a withering eye roll from the pierced cashier , heads south again . <p> A topless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presides over the intersection of Houston and Lafayette .

Cars and pedestrians snake through the clogged streets , smokers huddle outside the bars , and as always there 's a crowd waiting to get into CafT Habana . East of Elizabeth , however , the street goes black . On Bowery , the restaurant wholesalers are battened down as if for a storm .
