<p> A Kansas judge has given permission to exhume the remains of Jesse James . First Zachary Taylor , then John Wilkes Booth , now James . They 'll be going for Al Gore next . <p> If good things come to those who wait , the Republican assault on affirmative action will be something to behold . A bill to ban preferences in federal hiring and contracting is said to be forthcoming from Representative Charles Canady ( R. , Fla. ) and , more importantly , Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole . But it was supposed to be forthcoming before  --  namely in late June , until Dole abruptly canceled the press conference he had called to announce his bill . Behind some of the GOP skittishness is the idea that large numbers of minority voters are on the verge of joining the GOP ( We are very close to a major breakthrough with black voters , ' one House leadership aide explained to the Washington Times ) , and that attacking affirmative action will alienate them . Maybe . And maybe not  --  polls have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But whatever the politics , abandoning race neutrality as a principle would be too high a price to pay for a breakthrough with anyone . Speaker Newt Gingr ich says he understands this and pledged in a recent letter to the New York Times that it is his intention that the final GOP policy reflect the historic American ideal that personal success and happiness are best achieved through individual liberty and equal justice under the law . ' We 're waiting . <p> John Stuart Mill thought that recipients of government benefits should n't be allowed to vote  --  they 're too self-interested . But should they lobby ? Legislation proposed by GOP Representatives David McIntosh ( Ind . ) , Ernest Istook ( Okla. ) , and Bob Ehrlich ( Md. ) would prevent any organization that receives federal funds from spending more than 5 per cent of its non-federal income on political advocacy . Representative Bob Dornan ( Calif. ) goes further . He would cut off all tax-exempt advocacy groups like the American Association of Retired Persons from federal grants ( in FY1994 the AARP got $73 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-profits nor for-profit corporations could lobby on any matter related to any federal grants or contracts they receive . Both proposals hit the Left where it lives , so they 're meeting outraged opposition on Capitol Hill  --  with innocuous groups such as the YMCA taking the lead . But something along Dornan/McIntosh lines is essential to short-circuit the self-perpe tuating government machine in Washington . The last thing government should be subsidizing is efforts to make it larger . <p> Donors who pony up $100,000 for the Democratic Party will be rewarded with a dinner with President Clinton . Those donating $50,000 also get to eat with the President , but Hillary shows up . <p> William Bennett , in an interview with The New Yorker , discussed his fellow social conservative Pat Buchanan . The worst place to stand in a fight is . . . as someone who was on his side but has now deviated by one step . It 's a pathology of small differences with him . A real S &M; kind of thing . ' Bennett then repeated charges that some of Buchanan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America stuff , this You the People stuff  --  I think it 's tricky . ' Tricky indeed , if it makes conservatives resort to left-wing arguments when they disagree . If slightly misquoting the Preamble to the Constitution is flirting with fascism , who is preoccupied with small differences ? Mr. Bill wants clients who have been very bad . <p> Minority Leader Richard Gephardt , who submits his own versions of any promising Republican legislative initiatives , has come up with a truly Gephardtian flat tax . ' It has five tax brackets , just like the present tax code . The brackets are progressive , also like the present code . The rich get soaked , also like . . . But the rates are , like , rounder numbers , or something . The only thing flat about the tax is how it will fall . <p> Until July 10 , every cent that everyone in the country earned was taxed away . Government at all levels takes 52 per cent of net national product . Only this week did we start holding on to what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind as you follow the debate in Washington , D.C. , which is not about taking less , but about whether to slow the rate of taking more . <p> School choice is taking off in Milwaukee . For the last five years , an experimental program involving 800 children ( 1.5 per cent of the district 's students ) has distributed to their families vouchers worth $3,209 each , which can be applied to tuition at private non-sectarian schools in the city . Two weeks ago , the Wisconsin legislature approved Governor Thompson 's request to expand the program . Allocated funds will increase from $2.4 million to $14.7 million ; 7,000 students will be included , with an increase to 15,000 for the 1996 - 97 school year ; and parents will be allowed to use the vouchers at religious schools . Naysayers dispute the benefits of the program , and tremble for the future of the public-school system . But consider : the program saves the state money ( because private schools are almost all more efficient ) ; parents are involved in the schools and report overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commensurate if not superior . RIP the public-education monopoly ; long live p ublic education . <p> As the debate over normalizing relations continues , the White House has n't decided whether it would be better for President Clinton or the Democratic Party to make the first move toward the other . <p> John Major won his gamble and is still prime minister , but the balloting showed that at least a third of Tory MPs wished to be rid of him . Startling too , reports our London correspondent , Anthony Lejeune , was the near unanimity with which Conservative newspapers called for a new leader and new policies . The Majorettes now boast that their media foes were discomfited , although whether Gadarene swine should congratulate themselves on having brushed aside herdsmen crying Stop ! ' seems doubtful . In the subsequent cabinet reshuffle Major 's right-wing critics were excluded while Michael Heseltine , his potential challenger from the Left , was enthroned as deputy prime minister . And on policy Mr. Major has categorically refused to alter course . So the profound ideological split , over Britain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies , gapes as wide as ever . If the Conservatives had been defeated at the last election , they might now be undergoing a Republican-type revival . If they lose the next one ( as , in the light of their present unpopularity , seems probable ) , something similar may happen . Mr. Major , meanwhile , proposes to fight on the soggy middle ground . <p> Rapid Reaction Force Delayed '  --  headline , British Press Association , July 5 . <p> Excited crowds gathered around newsstands as the July Fourth holiday approached , all asking the same question : Would the Wall Street Journal editorial page ( Robert L. Bartley , proprietor ) dare to repeat its call for a constitutional amendment proclaiming There Shall Be Open Borders ' ' ? This high-water mark of loony libertarianism ( apart from anything else , what about disease ? welfare eligibility ? education costs ? ) first appeared a few years ago and was repeated several times . It seemed intended as an instant July Fourth tradition . But it was conspicuously absent last year , perhaps because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proposition 187 campaign . And the Journal blinked this year too . The disappointed crowds had to be content with an editorial extolling the virtues of skilled immigration . Which , of course , implicitly concedes NR 's point that one of the ways in which the current system is fatally flawed is precisely that skilled immigration has been choked off by the mi snamed family reunification ' provisions of the 1965 Immigration Act . The Journal says a Great Debate on immigration has begun , although the other side is notoriously absent from its pages . Not by Eastern Seaboard windows only , when daylight comes , comes in the light . <p> Hugh Grant became the Cary Grant/Fred Astaire of the Nineties by playing charming , diffident men who explicitly included bedding down in their badinage . In real life , he had lived for eight years with a beautiful model , reinforcing his image . Then in real life two vice cops caught him in a car performing a lewd act ' with a hooker . Has an illusion left us ? That unregulated passion can somehow be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is why Cary and Fred 's love interests always maneuvered them toward wedding rings  --  not that they would ever have been so crude as to propose doing without them . <p> Weighing the messy options , journalistic and ethical , the New York Times began printing the Unabomber 's manifesto in 800-word installments , signed Frank Rich . ' <p> Lord Thou Hast Delivered Our Enemies into Our Hands Department : The American Civil Liberties Union recently took out a four-page advertisement in The New Republic . Each page addresses a contentious issue and asserts that the American public agrees with the ACLU that organized school prayer is impolitic , that gays should have special legal recognition , that marijuana use should be legal , and that women should have the right to an abortion . At the bottom of the first three ad pages is the logo The American Civil Liberties Union , ' underlined by the phrase Live and Let Live , ' picked out in white on a bold black bar . However , on the final page  --  the one that defends abortion rights  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aborted , you might say . <p> Representative Patricia Schroeder ( D. , Colo. ) says the attempt in the House to make partial-birth abortions a felony reminds her of the old days when women were persecuted as witches . ' It 's easy to see why Representative Schroeder took refuge in similes . The partial-birth abortion  --  in which a fetus more than five months old is pulled out of its mother feet first up to its neck and then has its brains suctioned out with a catheter to collapse the skull  --  is as grotesque as abortion gets . Perhaps the most striking report on the subject was a New York Times article which quoted an abortionist as saying that some mothers find partial-birth abortions comforting because afterward the body can be dressed and held ' to allow a chance to say goodbye . ' All the debates about the medical nuances of this relatively unusual surgery ( does the fetus die painfully during the suction process , or is it killed beforehand ? ) fade away beside the image of a nurse dressing the tiny , mutilated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mother for a goodbye ' kiss . This picture should bring instant revulsion to any human being whose brain has n't been sucked out with a straw . <p> Elvis Presley told friends he saw Phil Gramm in a supermarket parking lot . <p>
