<p> PHOENIX - The sun shone through the open roof of Bank One Ballpark like a spotlight , and like every eye in the stadium , it seemed to follow Mark McGwire 's every move . <p> The excitement built as he stepped into the batter 's box to a standing ovation from about 25,000 home-run-crazed fans , and this was only batting practice . <p> The crowd seemed almost disappointed as McGwire customarily bunted the first pitch , but the fans soon got what they came to see and then some . St. Louis Cardinals hitting coach Dave Parker pointed toward two oblong scoreboards hanging high in left field and asked a security guard : " Has anyone ever hit those ? " <p> " No , " said the security guard , a quizzical look on his face . <p> " How about the restaurant ( in left field 's upper deck ) ? " Parker asked . <p> " I do n't think so , " the security guard answered . <p> " Well , there 's a good chance they just might get hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let you know . " <p> Then , someone else asked Parker : " Are those scoreboards really reachable for McGwire ? " <p> " Man , nothing this guy does surprises me anymore , " Parker replied . " His power is unbelievable . You have to see it to believe it . " <p> Let the show begin . <p> And it was a show . Batting practice usually takes place with music blaring in the background , but if music was playing at BOB on this day , it was hardly audible . Although McGwire was miles away from his home park , he was made to feel right at home . <p> His name was on the message board from the time his group surrounded the batting cages , and no matter who was hitting , the DiamondVision cameras were focused on McGwire . They even measured the distance of each homer he hit during BP . <p> Big Mac treated the crowd to seven home runs of a combined distance of 3,293 feet , including one super-sized shot that added to his ever-growing legend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are several open panels in the outfield gaps , and one in particular served as a perfect target for McGwire , who bounced a ball off the inside of one of the panels and into the street behind the left-center-field wall . The shot was estimated to have traveled 510 feet . <p> This particular blast sent the crowd into a frenzy , and McGwire , who seemed embarrassed by the reaction , could n't help but blush . He never reached the scoreboards in left field ( although he did do $ 2,000 worth of damage to the center-field scoreboard one day later ) , but there was a souvenir for a lucky fan in the restaurant . <p> Does Parker know his slugger or what ? <p> " It 's like this every day , " Parker said . " The first week or so , I was in awe , but it 's every day . He hits the ball as far and with more consistency than anyone I 've ever seen . This man hits the ball 500 feet just like it 's 300 feet . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most recognized redhead of the glamour scene this side of Lucille Ball and Fergie . <p> " He makes a place electric , " White Sox manager Jerry Manuel said . " Fans jump to their feet just to see him hit one . " <p> There has been plenty of jumping this season . McGwire leads the majors with 31 homers , and he 's on pace to finish with 75 , which would shatter Roger Maris ' single-season record of 61 . Although McGwire is considered the odds-on favorite to break Maris ' record if it ever falls , the Cardinals slugger realizes projections are meaningless after just 67 games of a 162-game season . <p> " I can honestly say I 've never thought about this , " McGwire said . " I 've thought about what it would be like if you got close to the home-run record - how you 'd deal with it and what you 'd see from other pitchers and all that . <p> " I really thought about it last year when I got close ( with 58 ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just enough to tell me that someone could do it . People talk , and that 's great . If it gets people paying more attention to baseball , that 's great . But it does n't make any sense for me to talk about it like it can happen . The season is so long ; that 's why I 'm so realistic . " <p> Realism seems to lose some of its meaning , however , when McGwire grabs a bat and heads toward the plate . An RBI single probably would please him just as much as a solo homer , but fans - and some players - want to see him hit home runs every single at-bat . Not just any old homer , but a mammoth shot such as the 545-foot bomb he hit earlier this season at St. Louis , the longest ever at Busch Stadium . <p> " They need to start changing the measurement system for him , " Phillies outfielder Doug Glanville said . " Using feet is getting too ridiculous . Quarter miles would be nice . " <p> With 418 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rocket start of 1998 to establish him as one of the greatest power sources of all time . Nevertheless , he has embarked on a major home-run binge over the first 2 1/2 months of the season . <p> McGwire became the first player in major-league history to hit 25 homers before the end of May , and he already has set a club record for home runs at Busch Stadium in a single season ( 18 ) . Although he has worn Cardinal red for only 118 games , he has become an icon in perhaps the best baseball city in America . <p> " I 've been here 11 years , and I 've never seen the reaction to anybody that I 've seen for this guy , " Cardinals catcher Tom Pagnozzi said . " I would n't even say Ozzie Smith was worshiped the way Mark McGwire is . " <p> McGwire seems to find such talk flattering , but constant questions about the chase for 62 and his awesome power do n't exactly qualify as his favorite topics , especially in the midst of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While his teammates ' desire to win is just as strong , they clearly enjoy being along for the ride as McGwire chases what might be baseball 's most hallowed record . <p> " This guy has tremendous power , " Cardinals right fielder Brian Jordan said . " He 's a great hitter and just a very positive guy . I like him a lot . At first , I did n't know what to expect . This guy is a power hitter who has hit a lot of home runs . I thought he might be arrogant . But he 's a really good teammate , and he handles himself well . Through this entire media parade , he 's handled himself well . He 's very low-key , and as a guy who looks up to him , I appreciate that . " <p> Earlier this season , Colorado Rockies manager Don Baylor suggested media hype would be the biggest obstacle for anyone who got close enough to challenge Maris ' record , but McGwire has lived the pursuit for so long , he just might be immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record that 's been intact for a long time , and you have to like to see that for the game of baseball , " Cardinals third baseman John Mabry said . " He 's handled it like a champ . He 's done the same things night in and night out , and if it 's bothering him , he has n't shown it . " <p> The season is full of bumps , slumps and nagging injuries , and only time will tell if McGwire has enough sting in his swing to keep the buzz going throughout the remainder of the year . Whatever happens , McGwire seems content to let others fuel the hype while his bat does the talking . <p> The chase <p> Throughout the season , Mark McGwire , on pace to hit 75 home runs , has remained consistently ahead of the pace set by Roger Maris when he hit a record 61 homers in 1961 . <p> McGwire . <p> 31 home runs after 67 games . <p> Maris . <p> 27 home runs after 67 games . <p> Maris . <p> 61 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellence <p> Mark McGwire 's pursuit of Roger Maris ' home-run record is attracting the most attention , but McGwire also is on pace to break two other major-league marks : <p> Home runs . <p> Current total : 31 . <p> Pace for season : 75 . <p> All-time leaders : <p> 1 .
