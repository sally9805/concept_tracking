( The set is a cheap flat with almost no furniture , just a rolled up futon , a table , two chairs . RACHEL sits at the table , toying with a cup of coffee . ) RACHAEL We got the news this morning . It 's still hard for me to take it in . It does n't even sound like a disease . It sounds more like a name for honey . Toast and Melanoma . Melanoma moon . The doctor was so calm when he told us . Clinical . But then how else would he be ? " Sorry guys . I just hate to break this to you on Valentines Day , but . . . " The first thing Joe says is , " Well I guess I 'm gon na have to shoot Turk . " " Why would you do that ? " I say . Because Turk is n't that old of a dog . Joe shrugs , " So he wo n't go on having fun without me . " " Well , I 'm lucky you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Joe throws me a cold sort of look and he says , right in front of the doctor , " Why would I want to shoot you ? I did n't have fun with you . " ( Pause . . ) I laugh it off at first , like it 's a joke . " Not once ? In fourteen years of marriage we have n't had fun once ? What about the time we . . . ( Pause. ) and what about the time ( Pause . ) But I do n't go on because I can see he is n't kidding . He 's serious . So serious that I ca n't even stay in the room with him . I do n't know how he got home because I still have the car keys in my pocket . I suppose the nurse got him a taxi . ( RACHEL rises , still nursing her coffee and moves away from the table . ) I ran out of there in a blind panic . I did n't want to cry . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I finally slowed down I 'd got all the way to the Mission district . I went into a caf to warm up , this is the coldest February 14th in 17 years it said on the weather , and drank three espressos before I noticed the sign on the counter  --  Apartment for Rent . The apartment was above the caf  --  three hundred a month . The man did n't want to show me at first . It was lunch hour and there were a lot of customers . But finally he gave me the key and I came up and took a look at it . You can see it is n't much  --  one big room and a kitchen  --  but it has a bathroom and everything works . I wrote a check for the deposit and here I am , eight hours after we got the news , in a one room walk-up , with a table , a chair and a futon mattress and no husband . ( RACHEL takes a long contemplative sip of her coffee . ) Amy helped me move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Pause. ) @x ( RACHEL stands with a plastic pop bottle filled with water in her hand hovering over some flowerpots . ) RACHAEL Bulbs . Look at them all . Present from Amy . She thought it would cheer me up watching things grow . Listen to this . ( Takes a small card from her pocket . ) " Dear Rachel , April does n't have to be a cruel month . Take it from one who knows . " She knows zip ! She was right about one thing , though . No one can forgive me . No one 's been to see me since I moved in , even Amy . She sent the bulbs . She does talk to me on the phone , but furtively , as though she 's taking a big chance . I do n't really care , either . They can all go to hell . And Joe . Joe and his honey sounding problem . . . I 'm not going to waste time trying to breathe flame into a cold fire . I 'm looking forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind I was in this morning . I 'm pacing up and down realizing how small this place really is and telling myself , " What the hell do I care . The whole of life is ahead of me . Let him go . " And then the doorbell rings . ( Pause . . She rearranges the pots a little . ) I do n't know if these 'll be up by April , but it 's a few weeks yet . ( She gets up , carries the bottle off , returns and stands by the table . ) Yes  --  it was Joe . I did n't know him at first . It was being in the dark of the stairwell , I suppose . He was just this object against the light . He had too many bags and some of them were slipping out of his arm , so without even thinking about objections , I let him in and brought him up here . He was wearing jeans and funny desert boots I had n't seen before . That 's all I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table and looked at everything there was to look at and finally he looked at me . " You seem different here , " he says . " So do you , " I tell him . I try to pin it down . What I 've been struggling with since I opened the door . " You seem . . . tentative . " " You mean I do n't seem so damned sure of myself . " He walks over to the window and looks out as if he needs to get his bearings . Then he says , without looking at me , " It took guts to move out . " I know what he 's been leading up to right ? It was there in the slump of his shoulders . I know what he 's going to say next and I do n't want him to say it . " I 'm not coming back , Joe . Even if you take back what you said . " " I 'm not taking it back . It was true . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had fun together . " I could have named a hundred times . But they seemed so foolish . When you think about it , most good times are over something dumb . " You see ! " " Well , if I 'm no fun why are you here ? " " I just brought you a few of your things , " he says . " You left in such a hurry . I guess I should n't have bothered you . " After that , of course , he would n't stay , not even for coffee . I followed him downstairs . Those ridiculous boots . He turned before he went out and for a moment I thought he was going to kiss me . But he did n't . " I just want you to know , " he said , " that I think it was a good idea moving here . I do n't know why , just good . " When I came upstairs again there were all the bags he 'd brought . ( Takes wine from bag , looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my things ? ( She pokes about in the bag . ) Two books about fishing and one about hockey ? Darts ? I imagine , now I 've moved out , well I know what 'll happen . He 'll have the guys over every night for poker and pizza , or hockey . And the house will fill up with man type trash  --  beer bottles , ash trays , cards . And they 'll talk about fights and hunting trips and about the mysterious thing between men and the land . Maybe if I had children it would be different . There would be a feminine counter landscape . Day care . Birthday parties . But I always feel alien about that too . Other women look at a room all messed up with toys and see their experience . I feel like I have to ask permission to sit down . I always feel distanced when I 'm in a group of women . Like I 'm on the edge . Sometimes I feel I 'm drifting away , seeing them from a long way . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent or stupid , but they 're authentic . That 's something I do n't ever think I 'll be . ( She picks up a dart and toys with it . ) I think I 'm in a depression . They 've been doing it on the talk shows lately , Oprah and Dini  --  clinical depression . It 's hard to see more than five minutes ahead . There 's nothing I want to do when I get up . I do n't have any enthusiasm . Amy says I should snap out of it . Join something . These darts have little sexy ladies on them . He brought a couple of photographs as well . One of Turk catching a Frisbee . And one of himself , it must be ten years old at least , pitching horseshoes ! Men . You fix up a little place for yourself and right away they want to hang their stuff in it ! ( Angrily , she hurls a dart at the bed. ) @x ( RACHEL is spreading a sheet on the mattress . ) RACHAEL I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only two days old . we shared a bed for twelve years and here I am acting like he 's company , or something . I 've been seeing Joe on and off the past few weeks . Today we met late in the morning and did a little browsing along Seventeenth  --  art galleries , book stores  --  working our way back here . We were having lunch in the cafe downstairs , when this drunk walks in with a big plastic bag under his coat . He walks over to one of the tables , whips the bag out from under his coat and opens it . Take my word for it , if you want an instant riot in a restaurant , just flash a chicken . The contents of the bag flutter and squawk . All four people at the table , men and women , scream and jump up . The drunk closes the bag and they all calm down and go back to their food . By this time he 's at another table and it 's the same thing . Opens bag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes from table to table . He 's having the time of his life . Finally one of the waiters collars him and takes away his bag . The old guy yells , " That 's my chicken . give me back my property ! " " I 'm calling the police , " says the waiter . The old man starts to blubber . " I only wanted to find a home for her ! " It 's a bad moment . The entire restaurant is now silent wondering what next . Suddenly , the waiter is not so sure of himself . The old man whimpers . And then what happens ? Joe . . . Joe gets out of his seat , takes the bag from the waiter , puts his arm around the old man and herds him outside . By this time , nobody in the restaurant 's eating a bite . We 're all looking out at Joe and the old man . The bag is grabbed back and forth . There 's some kind of conversation going on that we ca n't hear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old guy , I ca n't see how much , and he ends up with the bag . He then peers through the window and beckons me outside . I pay the waiter , we have n't even started our food , and out I go under the rapt gaze of everyone in the place . And then I find out the bad news . Joe wants me to keep the chicken . Naturally I put up a fight . Keeping a chicken in a one room apartment is not my idea of heaven . That 's when he tells me his mother 's living with him , cooking for him , doing his laundry , and he does n't want to take the chicken home because of her . He 's already worrying about coming home and finding Turk has been sent to the pound . His mother would n't hesitate for a moment over a chicken . By now I can see that the chicken means something extra to Joe . So I say , " All right , I 'll keep it for a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not doing stoop and scoop for anything that clucks . " So Joe says , " Do n't worry , I 'll take care of it . " And before I realize what 's happening he brings Henry up here , that 's what we 're calling her , Henry , puts her in the bathroom and goes home to get his things . ( She puts the pillow on the bed. ) @x ( RACHEL sips from a glass of wine . ) RACHAEL I do n't know if it 's working or not . I thought it would be much worse than this . Both of us being careful how we tread . Building causeways over swampy terrain . But it 's not like that . The worst has been said . And this place , it 's shabby and not too comfortable but there 's no baggage . We have our moments . Like the other day with the flowers , the bulbs that Amy sent . Joe bitched about those flowers from the moment he moved in . I do n't know why I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that much . They turned out to be hyacinths when I was hoping for paperwhites or crocuses . ( Pause. ) @x ( Lights dim and rise on RACHEL on the futon , tossing about . ) RACHAEL Oh God ! . Joe ! Joe , are you here ? ( Sits up and holds her head . Then she rises and holding her arms round herself , stands in thought for a moment , still in her dream . ) I 've been dreaming a lot lately . But this was . . . I do n't know . It was the end of the world . Or there 'd been a war . Everything was knocked down and smouldering and I was stumbling about among the ruins , crying . I could feel tears running down my face . I was looking for something . I do n't know what it was , just that it was important . There was plenty of stuff to find , odd things mixed in with the ordinary . . . Somebody 's knitting . A shawl with a silky fringe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wads of it . Stuffed in the chinks of the rubble . Curling up with the heat . Fluttering down from windows . Money everywhere . Things everywhere . But no people . Just me . Then after a while , I came to this wrecked house where one wall was left standing . It was black from the fire and messages had been chalked all over it . " Where are you ? " Meet me at Memorial and Tenth . " ( Pause . ) One of them said , " Jemma died badly . " ( Pause . ) There was a message there that I think was for me . It was just a scrawl but the writing looked familiar . It was inside a chalked heart , but as I got close the letters melted into oozy tears . I do n't know where Joe is . He 's been doing this a lot , getting up in the night and just walking till he wears himself out . It worries the hell out of me . What if he . . . I mean he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he goes without his wallet , without i.d . He 's not all that strong any more . And thin . You can almost see the flesh melting off him . ( She takes up picture beside bed . ) Look at him . He was so beautiful . I did n't see it at the time . I liked men better with their clothes on then . Did you ever see Cary Grant with his clothes off ? It always used to bug me how uncomfortable Joe looked in a suit , as if he did n't belong in it . He never stayed in a suit a moment longer than he had to . The minute he was home from the insurance company it was into his jeans and tank top . I hated it . I always thought he was too raw looking . It 's hard to believe , is n't it . This was a body you 're burn for and I could n't see it . Now he 's getting so thin . Sometimes I look up and I think , " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger has somehow got into the room . Then he turns and looks at me with those burning eyes , cranky , questioning , always questioning . That part is n't melting away . Every thing else is fading but that hard ornery core is still there . And we 're still cutting away at each other . I like it , though , and he likes it and it 's enough , you know ? I used to think we were n't in love because he did n't send me flowers , did n't like dancing or dinner by candlelight . But we were lovers by lip . Brassy and cutting . I can remember before we were married , visiting him in his bachelor . Drinking beer . Eating takeout . Getting high on absolutely nothing but lip . Everyone thinks we 're crazy , living here when we could be in the comfort of our own house . Amy tried to get us to go home . I had the feeling she was the official voice of a family delegation . " You 're not separated any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's practically third world . " What she ca n't understand is , if we went back to Briar Hill we 'd have to take back our Briar Hill lives . The old habits , old routines . Somehow , here , it 's clean . Nothing to trigger off old resentments . Old boredoms do n't have a chance to settle in . After living here I can see that boredom is something you choose because it goes along with comfort . ( Pause . ) And sometimes love is rejected because it 's prickly . But how do you tell this to someone ? His mother for instance . She wants us to come home so she can cook for us and do our cleaning . She wants to fill the house with soft lights and cooking aromas and wonderful little meals . Smooth over all the rough spots . She wants to ease her son 's last moments and I 'm depriving her of that . In her eyes I 'm the enemy and she 's using every weapon in her arsenal against me . Amy . Guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She phoned about him three times today . Make that yesterday , the sun 's almost up . ( Pauses a moment by the window . ) Turk is too much of a handful for her . I 've promised to do something today . I do n't know what . I ca n't see having that galumphing mutt here . We 'll have to put him in a kennel or maybe find a friend who 'll take him . She 's getting hysterical about it . We ca n't put Turk off any longer . Today for sure . ( Phone rings . She grabs it up . ) Joe ! Where are you ? . . . What are you doing down there . . . No . Look I 'll come right away . . . . Okay . I 'll be there . Just wait for me . . . Of course I do . Yes , I do . ( She rushes about getting her coat on . ) Keys keys keys keys . ( Starts to leave . Pauses. ) @x ( Lights dim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) RACHAEL Look at that . Three days of cleaning up and I 'm still finding feathers . When I went to pick up Joe the other morning , he 'd walked all the way down to Fish Creek . I thought he 'd be in terrible shape but whatever had been getting to him had been walked off . He was in a great mood . And it was catching . We went for breakfast and just could n't stop talking . You know the way that happens sometimes ? We must have been a couple of hours over our coffee . Then we went to 17th Ave and took a long time buying a bottle of wine . Actually it was two bottles . We did the bookstores . Had a little lunch . . . and all the time there I am with my night gown under my coat . It was well into the afternoon by the time we got home . We came in the door and right away we knew . Even before we came upstairs . Feathers and blood everywhere . And bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top of the stairs , tongue out and tail wagging like the conquering hero . Joe 's mother had come with Turk while we were away . I must have left the door unlocked when I rushed out to pick up Joe , that how she . . . She just put Turk inside the door and left him . Henry was out of her pen and . . . There was n't much left of her . Just blood and feathers . I could n't believe the feathers . And Turk just sitting there looking pleased with himself . I started to cry . Joe , of course , just laughed . " That 's what we get for meddling with fate , " he said . It took two glasses of wine before I could laugh along with him . By that time we 'd cleaned up the gore and were lying there on the futon with the window open on the street . And what with the sun pouring in and music coming up from the caf below , I was starting to feel almost cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turk woofing and moaning in the bathroom where he 'd been banished . We finished both bottles of wine and got very very . . . very . Next morning we argued over who was suffering the most . " Hangover , " I said , " You do n't know the meaning of the word . " " I thought you said I had the worst hangovers . " " That was then . This headache is definitely gold medal class . " " Oh yeah ? I could give this headache to the middle east and the fighting would stop . " To make things worse , in the cold light of morning it was obvious that we had n't cleaned up all of Henry . There were just so many feathers . Every time I thought I 'd found them all , another feather or two would flutter from somewhere . Finally Joe , who was more concerned with getting the coffee on the table , came over to me . Forget the feathers , " he said and put his arms round me . He made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . Then he took my hand . I want to tell you , " he said , " that these last weeks , it 's been fun . The most fun of my life . " " Fun ? It 's the booze talking . " " No . It has . " " Fun enough to shoot me ? " I guess that sounds like a pretty bitchy thing to say . But Joe did n't take it that way . He grinned , and the last thing he did was raise his hand up and . . . ( RACHEL raises her hand as if she 's holding a gun , pulls an imaginary trigger and softly , almost inaudibly , says " Pow ! " ) RACHAEL And he says : " I miss you already . " ( Lights dim to black . ) THE END
