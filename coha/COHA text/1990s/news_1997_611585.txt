<p> Dave Wolf seems to have it all : He 's a medical doctor with his own airplane , an electrical engineer honored for his inventions , a confident , extroverted 41-year-old bachelor . <p> And yet he has volunteered to leave all this and , for a civil servant 's pay , spend the next five months on what one member of Congress has suggested is a " suicide mission " aboard a temperamental foreign vessel that has become fodder for international headlines and late-night stand-up jokes . <p> U.S. astronaut Wolf is scheduled to lift off for the Russian space station Mir late Thursday aboard the shuttle Atlantis , along with an international crew of six others , to become the sixth American to live aboard Mir . <p> Is he nuts ? <p> " I do n't expect a pleasure cruise out of this , " Wolf said of his planned Mir sojourn , in an interview last week . " I intend to describe conditions aboard Mir as they really are . It warms me that the public is concerned , and we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they paid for , and let them live it with us . " <p> But his own concern focused as much on the recently edgy public response as about any discomforts or dangers aboard Mir . " If I tell you how I really feel , rather than just give you raw data , if I describe something as uncomfortable , I do n't want to be labeled as a complainer , " he said . " I 'm trapped a little , here . . . . I 've seen what the media has done to other astronauts . " <p> The joint U.S.-Russian flights aboard Mir , punctuated this year by at least two serious emergencies and a string of tiresome problems ( including yesterday another computer glitch and drops of an unidentified brown liquid " fanning out " from the facility ) , have become a kind of Rorschach inkblot test in the sky , revealing widely differing attitudes toward human space flight and the intimidating risk-benefit calculations it entails as practitioners struggle to extend its reach . <p> Wolf is eager to go , the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressuring the space agency to stop American visits to Mir , and even some astronauts have expressed reservations about the value of going ahead with the remaining two scheduled American trips to the 12-year-old facility . Vice President Gore and NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin are in Moscow this week for long-planned top-level talks with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin that will focus , in part , on the U.S.-Russian future in space . <p> Two of the worst nonfatal calamities in spaceflight history  --  a fire and **25;30;TOOLONG  --  have occurred aboard Mir , triggering a flood of public concern that has put the credibility of both the U.S. and Russian space programs on the line . <p> NASA managers have emphasized that despite some alarming moments : ( a ) their detailed reviews indicate Mir remains safe enough to meet U.S. standards for the inherently risky undertaking , and ( b ) they are learning valuable lessons from the Mir experience that should reduce the risks of ambitious future space operations , as intended . <p> Some argue that the joint Mir flights have already accomplished their goals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 months , U.S. shuttles have docked there six times and scientists have gotten a " leg up " on how to use space for long-term research , while U.S. and Russian personnel aloft and on the ground have gradually improved their crucial working relationships , according to independent analysts . <p> But Mir is not the only issue . One of the lessons NASA flight managers have learned is that , if they want to keep flying humans on long-duration flights of any kind , they must not only worry about safety and productivity aloft but face an uphill job of public education on the ground . <p> That 's because , they say , space is inherently risky and there will always be human and mechanical fallibilities to contend with , not to mention routine maintenance , whether the facility is 12 years old , like Mir , or new . If you like the Mir " show , " in other words , you 'll love the long-planned $ 60 billion international space station , whose construction is scheduled to begin next year in orbit , with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaceflight has been a complex business for some years now , the fact is that both of us Russians and Americans are very young , and just making the first baby steps toward living and working in space , as societies , " Wolf said . " Therefore we have a multitude of issues to work out . " <p> The question is , if the American public does n't understand , or trust , NASA 's assessment of Mir 's problems today , how will the agency sustain its hard-won support through the ration of difficulties likely to bedevil the most ambitious international engineering project in peacetime history ? Has the nation become too " risk averse " to lead such an undertaking ? <p> " I 'm worried about whether the country still has the courage to do high-technology projects like this , " said Frank Culbertson , NASA 's manager of joint U.S.-Russian space activities , the man who is sending Wolf to Mir . He is a former Navy test pilot who has experienced shipboard fires , 350 carrier landings and other hazards . And he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockpit three seconds from liftoff when the firing shuttle main engines had to be shut down suddenly . He helped investigate the 1986 Challenger disaster , in which a shuttle crew of seven perished . <p> The public 's focus should not be solely on the " problems " in orbit , but also on the response of well-trained personnel , Culbertson said . " I do n't mind people asking the hard questions , but it bothers me if they are n't hearing the answers , " he said . <p> One of his main priorities of late , he said , has been to convince other countries that the United States can be a reliable partner . <p> Valery Ryumin , director of the Russian agency ( now a corporation ) that built Mir , said here last week that the media have exaggerated Mir 's shortcomings . He suggested the Americans will look like " sunshine space explorers " if they " head for the hills " whenever something goes wrong . Ryumin , who faces aggressive opposition to the U.S.-Russian space partnership inside his own country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start of work on the new space station . <p> The reason for the evident frustration among spaceflight officials was summed up by aerospace analyst Marcia Smith of the Congressional Research Service last week in testimony before Congress . " I think that because there has been so much press attention to Mir lately , almost entirely negative , public opinion is that Mir is a questionable place to send U.S. astronauts . . . . This may or may not be a justified opinion , " she said . Because of this , if there were a tragedy aboard Mir , she went on , " I think they would wonder why it was that NASA had sent an astronaut up there  --  what was it that the astronaut was going to do up there that was so important and so valuable that they would risk his life . " <p> Culbertson and his colleagues maintain that nobody has more reasons to work to prevent the chances of a tragedy in orbit , with all its devastating consequences , than they do , and that they would be leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threat to their lives that they could n't handle . <p> Many Americans have grown up to the rhythms of the space shuttle and its particular approach to risk assessment , particularly since the 1986 Challenger accident put the public through a televised crash course in the catastrophic consequences of an avoidable failure in a rubbery O-ring . Reporters have become sensitized to the fact that a preventable tragedy might be taking shape on their watch , transforming every mishap into a possible foreshadowing . <p> A space station that remains in orbit for decades , however , is a flying object of a different sort entirely , Culbertson argues . The shuttle is handled as a craft that must take off and land , with servicing done on the ground in hangars by a standing army of thousands . ( The proper comparison to it on the Russian side , he said , is the Soyuz craft used to ferry crews to and from Mir , whose safety and operations are treated much like the U.S. shuttle fleet . ) <p> Mir ( like the planned new station ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairs routinely carried out underway by two or three people in orbit ( and remote technical assistance from a few dozen on the ground ) . " With Mir , we can never bring it back to port . We ca n't put it in dry dock , " Culbertson said . <p> As a deliberate strategy , for example , the new international space station will use noncritical components until they fail , he said , rather than shutting them down routinely for preventive maintenance . This eliminates the need to keep a huge complement of spare parts onboard , but it could give a casual observer the alarming impression that " wow , things are failing , " he said . This is the same approach used now with Mir . <p> Culbertson , Wolf and others said they feel that some of the worst possible emergencies that can befall a spacecraft , including fire and **25;57;TOOLONG , have already occurred aboard Mir and been dealt with , as the training called for , without harm to the crew . <p> Wolf acknowledged he was not enthusiastic about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says now , " I was wrong . . . . Now I ca n't imagine going into construction of the new space station without them . "
