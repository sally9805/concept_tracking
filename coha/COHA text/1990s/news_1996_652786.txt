<p> As drivers on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive approach 60th Street , they may well wonder whether an amusement park has just opened . A giant , looping aluminum spiral weaving gracefully through the sky looks more like a roller coaster than a work of art . But " East River Roundabout " is part of a recently completed $2.5 million pavilion created by the sculptor Alice Aycock . <p> Other curious sights have become part of New York 's urban landscape : a bronze alligator dressed in a tie and jacket climbs out of a manhole at the Metro Tech Center in downtown Brooklyn , and mosaic-tile sea creatures swim along the walls of the Houston Street subway station in Manhattan . <p> " It 's everywhere , " said Tom Finkelpearl , director of the Percent for Art program in New York City , which mandates that 1 percent of the budget for city-financed construction go toward the purchase or commissioning of artwork . " I guess you could say public art has come of age . " <p> Between the permanent installations that punctuate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their temporary counterparts installed for perhaps a year at a time , there is more new public art in the New York metropolitan area right now than there has been since the Depression , Mr. Finkelpearl said . Some of the pieces are conventional , others quite adventurous , and the range of artists is as wide as that of the work . <p> Getting art into public places takes time , so the current artistic bonanza has little to do with today 's sluggish building market and much to do with projects conceived during the boom years of the late 1980 's . " Percent for Art has been around since 1982 , " Mr. Finkelpearl said . " But a large number of works have been finished only recently . " <p> The gold rush wo n't last . Much of the art being installed now and over the next year or so may well be the last for quite a while . " There was a boom in Federal building that began about eight years ago , but it 's coming to an end , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the General Services Administration in Washington . " Right now we have about 80 projects under way , but with the tightening of belts everywhere , these kind of works will be drying up . " <p> The Percent for Art program has been the driving force behind the art installed on city- and state-owned property . But the influx of artworks also reflects how important marketing has become in the real estate market . Art gives a special signature to a building and its site . <p> Battery Park City , the 92-acre neighborhood at the tip of lower Manhattan , has been at the forefront in using art in original ways . " Here art is not simply an object , " said Philip R. Pitruzzello , president of Battery Park City . " It 's the fabric of every project . From the developers ' perspective , it adds value to their real estate . " <p> Art at Battery Park City comes in many forms . Roy Lichtenstein 's 30-foot " Modern Head " in blue painted stainless steel , for example , is among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street early next month by the Battery Park City Authority in cooperation with the Public Art Fund , a nonprofit organization that commissions public art around the city . <p> But most of the art at Battery Park City is permanent . There is a colonnaded open-air court of blue stone created by the sculptor Ned Smyth , granite furniture designed by Richard Artschwager and a children 's playground of fairy-tale creatures by the sculptor Tom Otterness in Hudson River Park . The latest addition to Battery Park 's collection is a pair of majestic stainless steel pylons created by the sculptor Martin Puryear that appear like giant markers on the water 's edge at North Cove . <p> Uptown , Alice Aycock 's piece , on the site of a former Sanitation Department garage , also transforms Manhattan 's waterfront . The sculpture , , along with a pavilion designed by the landscape architects Quennell Rothschild Associates , was commissioned by New York Hospital , the Hospital for Special Surgery and Rockefeller University as part of a deal struck with the city when the three institutions expanded in 1993 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be approved by several community groups , among them the East River Waterfront Conservancy , the Parks Council and the Municipal Arts Society . Gone are the days when public arts projects were simply decided by decree ; indeed , residents now have a voice in most of them . <p> " We 're tacking to a different wind than we were in the 1960 's and 70 's , " said Dale Lanzone , director of cultural and environmental affairs for the General Services Administration in Washington . " So many people objected to having only arts professionals choose the artists , that in 1989-1990 we began involving the community . It was a difficult birth process , but it made us step back and start thinking about what public art is supposed to be . " <p> What Mr. Lanzone and others are trying to avoid is a replay of the bitter feelings that erupted over Richard Serra 's " Tilted Arc , " which was removed from 26 Federal Plaza in Foley Square in 1989 after a long , nasty debate . People complained that whatever its artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the plaza unusable . Now artists are generally chosen by panels made up of arts professionals and community leaders , and one result is more conservative , less controversial art . <p> But community battles still occur . It took Edward J. Minskoff eight months to get approval from the City Planning Commission to convert the atrium of the former I.B.M . Building at Madison Avenue and 57th Street into a sculpture garden organized by PaceWildenstein , the Manhattan gallery . Mr. Minskoff acquired the building from I.B.M . last year . Some critics argued that having a commercial gallery organize shows would compromise the public nature of the space , even though there were strict laws that none of the art could be for sale . <p> Mr. Minskoff won the fight . Last month the 10,000-square-foot atrium became an exhibition space in which several shows are to be presented each year . ( I.B.M . provided the public space in exchange for zoning concessions from the city when it erected the building . ) Mr$ Minskoff also placed Calder 's " Saurien , " a bright orange stabile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57th Street . <p> " In every project I do I try to incorporate art , " said Mr. Minskoff , who is a collector of contemporary works . " There may be some people who object to it at first , but after a while it grows on them . These works give people the chance to see great art without going to a museum . " <p> Artists enjoy the chance to create public art for much the same reason . " Reaching a true public , not just people who go to galleries and museums , is a fantasy a lot of us have , " said Mr. Otterness . In the last five years , about 80 percent of his commissions have been for public spaces . " My ideas and inspiration come from it , " he said . <p> Mr. Otterness has four projects installed around New York , and he is at work on six more . His work is easy to recognize : he has created a family of lovable bronze creatures , both human and animal , that reflect the artist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , for example , a figure wearing nothing but a pointed hat is pulling down Humpty-Dumpty 's house , which is filled with five-inch bronze pennies and a group of Champagne-drinking characters dressed in top hats and pearls . <p> Many artists use the public arena to say something about time and place . Ms. Aycock said the looping spiral trusses that form " East River Roundabout " were created to echo all the movement that surrounds it : the helicopters that fly overhead , the water traffic on the East River , the cars driving over the Queensborough Bridge and the Roosevelt Island tramway . <p> " I tried to galvanize all these forms , " she said . It was the artist 's first public project in Manhattan , and she is working on two more on the West Coast . " There are always a lot of issues involved when you are creating something like this , " she said . " Fortunately , this was not watered down for the public or for budget reasons . It is what I envisioned . " <p> Below ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village Murals , " four ceramic triptychs created by a group of fifth- and sixth-graders , depict portions of Greenwich Village history . At the entrance of the Fifth Avenue and 53d Street subway station , an oil painting by the New York artist Ralph Fasanella , installed earlier this month , shows what the artist says are " subway riders at night after a hard day 's work . " <p> Wendy Feuer , director of Arts for Transit , an arm of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , said of the projects : " Artists do n't think about their work in an elitist way . This is n't the Taj Mahal . " <p> At the height of its program , the Metropolitan Transit Authority spent an average of $1 million a year on artwork for subway stations and commuter rail stations in the metropolitan area . " What you 're seeing is the first phase of a five-year capital campaign program which has now reached critical mass , " Ms. Feuer said . <p> Besides providing a visual anchor for commuters , she said , art helps people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It makes people think , ' If the art can survive , so can I. ' "
