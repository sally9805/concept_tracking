Jerry Hodge is a Texas sportsman whose usual idea of a good time is venturing into the wild for a little game hunting . But in the spring of 1989 , Hodge , vice chairman of the Texas board of criminal justice , invited two buddies to join him on what he called " the ultimate hunt . " The quarry : a convict from the penitentiary . <P> While Hodge and his friends ate lunch , an inmate from the Huntsville prison was released on state property and told to " lay track " by crossing streams , walking in circles , and finally climbing a tree stump . Later a pack of baying hounds was let loose on the convict 's trail . Hodge and his friends mounted horses to join in the chase . When located , the inmate was sitting on the stump , wearing a padded " fight suit " in the midst of the frenzied canines . To commemorate the good time , Hodge bought jackets , which were embroidered with the slogan THE ULTIMATE HUNT , and gave them to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week after the event was revealed by the press . Critics snarled at Hodge for taking nonprison officials along on the chase and for insensitivity in ordering the jackets . The fuss spilled into the Governor 's race because Hodge also serves as Republican candidate Clayton Williams ' spokesman on prison issues . His Democratic opponent , state Treasurer Ann Richards , started howling for Hodge 's departure . State legislator Ron Wilson denounced the use of inmates as prey as " a slave sport . " He vowed to introduce legislation to end the hunts , which take place several times a week at 25 of the state 's 35 prisons . <P> Prison spokesman David Nunnelee claims chasing after " dog boys , " as the prisoners are called , is necessary to hone the tracking skills of the 680 hounds used to run down escapees . Hodge ruefully concedes that the jackets were in bad taste , and has apologized for bringing nonprison officials on the hunt . He has even offered to " run the track " himself and have a pack of reporters chase after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed might be the " dog boys . " Prisoners who volunteer to be pursued have time cut from their sentences . And at least one former inmate described his experience as " a blast . "
