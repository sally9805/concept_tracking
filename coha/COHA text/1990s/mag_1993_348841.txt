BUY A VACUUM CLEANER OR WASHING MACHINE from Maytag 's British subsidiary , Hoover , and get two air tickets to the U.S. or continental Europe , free ! Sound like a good deal ? You bet ! Such a good deal , in fact , that Hoover sold tens of thousands of appliances  --  far more than the company anticipated . Great ! Right ? <P> Not from a bottom-line perspective . The travel agents contracted by Hoover to supply the service were overwhelmed by the demand . They placed unreasonable conditions on the freebie flights  --  expensive extras , inconvenient airports , undesirable departure dates  --  that seemed designed to discourage customers from claiming their free tickets . But the uproar from disgruntled Hoover users was so great that Maytag 's managers back in the U.S. stepped in and fired three top Hoover executives . Maytag also set up a $30 million fund to pay for the promised flights , which , the company says , would be granted to all those who qualified for the promotion .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
