<p> DALLAS - A Dallas man machine-guns ( SEE CORRECTION ) two teen-agers for stealing wheel ornaments from his car . <p> In two cases - one in Houston , the other near Fort Worth - men shoot and kill their daughters when they mistake them for burglars . <p> A man near Waco catches a teen-age thief , calls the boy 's mother to tell her he 's going to blow her son away , then shoots him in the back with a shotgun . <p> In only the latter case was the shooter indicted . In the other cases , police either failed to file charges or grand juries refused to indict . <p> Experts say that 's just the way things are in Texas : If you are defending yourself , your family or your property against imminent harm - or if you believe that 's what you are doing - you can shoot to kill . Especially at night . <p> " " When homeowners , property owners or merchants raise the defense of deadly force to protect property , grand juries have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Norman Kinne , chief prosecutor for Dallas County . <p> Kinne should know . He was the prosecutor who took the wheel ornaments case to a Dallas County grand jury , seeking murder charges against Shedric Bables , 23 . That grand jury declined to indict Bables in spite of evidence that he had methodically executed two teens in a parked car after the man who was actually removing the wheel ornaments had run away . <p> In defending his actions , Bables ' lawyers pointed to the portion of Texas law governing the use of force by private citizens in protection of property , which is quite different from the use of force in self-defense . In self-defense , a person who shoots someone to death must be able to prove that shooting was the only way to escape serious personal harm . <p> The law on protection of property sets up certain conditions under which it is not legal to shoot a thief or an intruder . <p> But all bets are essentially off if the theft occurs at night , as was the case with Bables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , you can shoot a thief simply to stop him from stealing or to stop him from getting away after he has stolen something . <p> " " Texas law is fairly standard in line with other states , " said University of Texas criminal law professor Robert Dawson , " " except for that one nonstandard protection giving a citizen the right to use deadly force to prevent someone who stole something at night to escape with the property . That 's an extreme position . " But that extreme provision of Texas law - giving you the right to kill someone in order to keep him from getting away with your stereo set under cover of darkness - is actually the oldest , most traditional portion of the law , Dawson said , going back to horse thieves and the earliest history of Texas . <p> Paul Blackman , a research analyst for the National Rifle Association in Fairfax , Va. , cites an even earlier source for the distinction between shooting a thief at night and doing it in broad daylight : " " It 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I believe it 's chapter 22 . " Indeed , Exodus 22:2-3 does include some instructions on what to do if you catch a thief trying to get away , and it does seem to make some kind of distinction between a thief who is caught " " if the sun be risen upon him " and one who is not . But the passage 's precise relevance to Texas law is a little unclear . <p> " " The point is that this is not new , " Blackman said . " " A few states have passed so-called ' Make My Day ' laws , which say if a burglar breaks in at night you do n't have to prove he 's a burglar in order to shoot him . But basically people have had certain rights to deal with this for a long time . " <p> No one keeps track of homicides in Texas that turn out to have been justifiable acts in defense of property . The closest thing to a national measure is the FBI 's tracking of all justifiable homicides , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . That number has been surprisingly flat over the last five years , according to Gary Kleck , a professor at Florida State University and author of the 1991 book , " Point Blank : Guns and Violence in America . " <p> The FBI numbers , Kleck said , reflect only the initial determination by police of whether a shooting was justifiable or not . They do n't include situations where a person was charged initially but cleared later by a grand jury . And they do n't include certain other types of justifiable homicides . <p> The FBI numbers have shown roughly 350 justifiable homicides nationally each year by private citizens since 1991 . Kleck said other studies with a broader view have estimated the true number at between 1,500 and 2,800 nationally . But both kinds of measurements , he said , have shown about the same number each year . <p> " " I 'd be inclined to believe there 's not much of a trend , " Kleck said . He said part of the problem in measuring the role of guns in typical home-defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those are the only incidents recorded . <p> " " Most defensive situations involving a gun do not involve anybody getting shot , " he said . He said his research shows that " " defenders who use a gun actually shoot the gun in only a quarter of the cases , and those shootings result in death in about one in 1,000 cases . " <p> Kleck said he believes the willingness of gun owners to use their weapons against intruders has always been quite high . " " I have in my files results of a national poll taken in 1989 in which gun owners were asked if they would be willing to shoot a burglar , and 78 percent said yes . " <p> He said a more recent poll of those who own guns and those who do n't showed that 66 percent of the entire population would be willing to shoot an intruder if the occasion arose . <p> The fact that the law appears to allow homeowners and property owners a lot of leeway does not mean they have carte blanche . <p> In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department announced it would seek a murder indictment of a homeowner who shot a burglar who had broken into his garage . <p> According to investigators , the thief in that case was unarmed and fleeing , the crime happened during the day , and the homeowner had chased the thief off his property when he shot him . <p> Dallas prosecutor Kinne said there are many cases where a claim of justifiable homicide may not impress a grand jury - especially when a grand jury may suspect that something else was going on or that defense of property is being offered as a tricky defense by a wrongdoer . " " That does n't sell , " Kinne said . <p> The law is specific and is not always on the side of the homeowner , said Keno Henderson , trial bureau chief in the Harris County district attorney 's office . " " It just depends on the facts , " he said . " " Generally , grand juries will follow the law . " <p> But even if grand juries all tend to follow the same law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credibility of witnesses and defendants - in other words , about what really happened . Paul Chitwood , one of the attorneys for Shedric Bables , said he had advised his client not to grant an interview for this story , even though a Dallas County grand jury had already declined to indict his client . <p> " " They 're about to appoint a new grand jury , " Chitwood said . <p> " " And there is nothing to prevent Norm Kinne from taking this same case back to the new grand jury and trying it again . " <p> The mothers of the teen-agers Bables shot are lobbying hard for Kinne to do just that . <p> Legal killing <p> Cases of justifiable homicide by private citizens : 1990 - 1991 - 1992 - 1993 - 1994 . <p> TEXAS 37 33 43 47 33 <p> NATIONWIDE 328 331 351 357 353 <p> CORRECTION-DATE : February 22 , 1996 <p> CORRECTION : Shedric Bables used an AK-47 assault weapon , not a machine gun , when he shot the two teen-agers .
