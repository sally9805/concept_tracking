<p> HOW DOES AN ACTOR breathe new life into four of the most famous words ever spoken in English ? <p> That was the problem facing Aidan Quinn as he sought shelter from the equatorial sun on the shores of Lake Victoria . Sitting on a grass-roofed veranda in a mud-hut village , he doffed his pith helmet and said the line to himself . <p> " Dr. Livingstone , I presume ? " he said lightly , with a mischievous air , trying it out . <p> He turned to a companion . " I do n't want to think about it , " he said . <p> Nearby , an assistant director , Howard Ellis , marshaled 150 Luo tribesmen into a ragged column . They wore traditional barkcloth and banana-leaf clothing with copper jewelry and shell headdresses . The cinematographer , David Connell , leaned on cameras set up under umbrellas in front of the crowd . " We are now going to form a wall of people through which the white man Stanley will go to meet the white man Livingstone , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Luo . The extras shifted nervously on their feet . <p> For three weeks , the crew of " Forbidden Territory : Stanley 's Search for Livingstone " had been living in tents in Kenya , filming the story of Henry Morton Stanley 's search for Dr. David Livingstone , one of the most poignant tales in the tortured history of Europeans in Africa . <p> The producers had built a traditional village on the Lake Victoria island of Rusinga for this moment , taking pains to make sure it looked as the village Ujiji , in present-day Tanzania , would have on Nov. 10 , 1871 , when the Welsh-born Stanley , the brash correspondent sent by The New York Herald to track down the legendary missionary and explorer Livingstone , finally found his man . <p> The cameras would now follow Stanley through a tunnel of half-naked humanity . At the end would appear his quarry , Livingstone , a white-haired man in red waistcoat and a sea captain 's cap , portrayed by the British actor Nigel Hawthorne . <p> " Forbidden Territory " is a made-for-television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being shot on location in Africa but also for going to great lengths to capture a historically accurate feel and the panoramic grandeur of a feature film . <p> The first of five movies about explorers to appear under National Geographic 's name , the 92-minute film is being produced by National Geographic and Hallmark Entertainment for about $6 million . It is expected to be broadcast by ABC in the fall . <p> " With National Geographic 's name on it , people expect something sumptuous , " said Judd Parkin , who is producing the film with Robert Halmi . " We are going for scope . " <p> The film follows the lives of Stanley and Livingstone from just before their famous meeting in 1871 until Livingstone 's death in May 1873 . It is the story of two intrepid explorers whose personalities could hardly have been more different : one an idealistic crusader against slavery , the other a hard-bitten , cynical war correspondent out for fame . <p> John Pielmeier 's script is centered on Stanley , who came to the United States at age 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming a correspondent . Receiving his assignment from The Herald 's publisher , James Gordon Bennett , to find Livingstone , who had vanished on an expedition in search of the Nile 's source , Stanley begins his quest with overweening ambition , and a desire to impress the English society that has shunned him . But as Stanley encounters Livingstone , he discovers a mission , a sense of higher purpose . The driven journalist becomes an explorer . <p> THIS INTERPRETATION OFStanley is likely to be questioned by historians . While there is little doubt Livingstone had an enormous influence on the young reporter , Stanley 's later trips into present-day Zaire to help King Leopold of Belgium gain possession of the Congo certainly had other than altruistic motives . There is little evidence he ever lost his thirst for fame . <p> Mr. Halmi , the executive producer and Hallmark Entertainment 's chairman , said he had been fascinated by Stanley since going to Africa himself as a journalist for Life magazine in 1952 . The hardships endured by the explorers obsessed him , but especially Stanley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition than to get a great scoop . " Livingstone was a missionary , and the only person he really converted was Stanley , " Mr. Halmi said . <p> The producers and screenwriter say they have stayed close to history , drawing from the explorers ' journals as well as other accounts of the time . The costumes are carefully researched , and guns and props are from private collections from the era . <p> The scenes do not shrink from violence , depicting not only the massacres and daily brutality of slave traders but also Stanley 's cruel treatment of his partners and porters . <p> The scenes of Stanley 's 411-day trek to find Livingstone were shot in the Masai Mara reserve in southern Kenya , a vast wilderness still teeming with wildlife . For the slave-market scenes in Zanzibar , the producers chose the remote , relatively unspoiled island of Lamu , off the Kenyan coast , which looks much as it did 150 years ago . " I want to tell the truth about things , " Mr. Halmi said . " This is as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is following in the steps of Spencer Tracy , who portrayed Stanley in the first " Stanley and Livingstone , " the grand 1939 production by 20th Century Fox . On location here , he gives a studied performance of a disturbed man haunted by his childhood in a Welsh workhouse and the horrors of the American Civil War . His Stanley is arrogant , cunning , driven and violent . But he softens when he meets the more spiritual Livingstone . <p> " What the film says is that he is redeemed and that he will be a changed man and committed to these noble causes , " Mr. Quinn said . " That 's not necessarily what happened , but that 's what the film says . " <p> For his part , Mr. Hawthorne sees Livingstone as a good-hearted bungler , who never achieved his goal of finding the source of the Nile . He portrays Livingstone as a saintly person with immense love for the Africans and an unflagging faith in God . " I have a huge passion for the sort of man he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a muddler . He got a lot of his calculations wrong . " <p> The director , Simon Langton , who most recently directed the BBC-A &E; mini-series " Pride and Prejudice , " said he wanted the film to communicate " the toughness of it all , the disease and the pain they had to go through . " <p> " I do n't think people realize what people were made of in those days , " he said , taking a break from setting up the climactic scene . " I want it to be tough , to make sure people know that people did die very easily in such an environment . " <p> Shooting the film in Kenya meant constant logistical headaches . The crew camped out in 70 tents on the Masai Mara for more than two weeks while scenes were shot there . At one point filming was interrupted for a pride of lions that wandered into the area , and there were endless haggles with local chiefs who demanded payment for the use of certain locations . <p> MR . LANGTON SAID HE had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swarms of black flies that sometimes swept in off Lake Victoria , blocking out light for hours . " Africa can turn on you and bite you very quickly indeed , " he said . " You can suddenly have storms that can wreck everything . You have to be terribly prepared . " <p> When the crew moved to Rusinga Island , they discovered they were to be housed in a tent camp in the middle of a dusty parking lot . There were cockroaches as large as domestic pets . The caterer did not arrive the first day . Tempers grew short . <p> And for some white cast members , the extended shoot in East Africa , where the effects of poverty and corrupt government are visible everywhere , prompted guilty reflections on the European colonization that followed Stanley and Livingstone . " There is a real question about whether the people are better off or worse off , " Mr. Quinn said . <p> Most of the Kenyan actors , however , said they were n't troubled by the scramble for Africa that exploration touched off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film 's portrayal of Africans . The primary characters are Susi , Chuma and Kalulu , loyal servants to Stanley and Livingstone . <p> " I do n't think we should discard history , no matter how bad it is , " said Lenny Juma , a Kenyan actor who cast most of the African parts . " People should know what happened . " <p> After hours of setting up , the directors were finally ready to film the scene in which Stanley says , " Dr. Livingstone , I presume , " and the weary explorer replies , " Yes . " <p> They ran through it three times . Each time , Mr. Quinn waded through the sea of extras , doffed the helmet , shook Mr. Hawthorne 's hand and tried the line . Each time , he said the words tentatively , as if they contained a real question , as if Stanley were awed , unsure of himself at the end , in the presence of the great man he had sought for more than a year . <p> On the third take , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lip and shook his head . " Let me try it once more , " he said . <p> On take 4 , Mr. Quinn delivered the line with authority . It was solid , brash , strong  --  not a question , but a statement , a triumph . Stanley , the cocksure journalist , had arrived . There was a collective sigh of relief on the set ; everyone knew Mr. Quinn had nailed it . <p> " Cut ! " Mr. Langton yelled , leaping up to shake Mr. Quinn 's hand . " That 's it . Brilliant . "
