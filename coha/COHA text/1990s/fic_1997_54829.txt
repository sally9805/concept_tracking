It was subtraction eve , and the children went through the house looking at everything they cherished , wondering which things Santa would sneak in and steal that night . <p> Janie 's birthday was the week before Subtraction . She hated the fact that her birthday was so close to the holiday . She only got to play with her presents for a week before most of them disappeared forever . Sometimes she thought her parents gave her crummy gifts on purpose  --  why spend money on something she would lose before she even got a chance to break it.z <p> Mike 's birthday was in the spring and he always got much neater things . <p> " This time I 'm going to hide the truck behind the toilet , " Mike said , cradling his yellow Tonka truck in his arms . <p> " Do n't be stupid . It does n't matter where you put it . The more you do n't want him to find it , the more he can find it . He 's got some kind of sniffer to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " He did n't find Monkey Man last year , " Mike said . <p> " You did n't like Monkey Man last year . You did n't like Monkey Man until he was the only toy left . " Janie looked at her doll , Brewster . Worn and battered Brewster , with the hair half off his head , his clothes all torn and stained . Janie had her own way of dealing with Brewster and Santa . She had had Brewster for four years now . She roughed him up right before Subtraction , made him ugly and dirty , looked at him and thought bad thoughts . She spent all of Subtraction Eve thinking about anything other than Brewster ; if she thought of Brewster she thought about him as her most hated toy . So far , Brewster had been there each Subtraction morning , and she could get back to taking good care of him . <p> She was n't sure her method would work this year . Even though Santa was only supposed to take the good things , the new things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have enough money to get their own neat new things , Janie had heard of Santa taking someone 's best loved teddy bear even though it was missing both eyes and an ear . She thought Santa took things just for spite sometimes . <p> She had never heard of a single person who had gotten anything from Santa . She had her suspicions . She thought Santa took everything to the stores so when they opened up the day after Subtraction , the biggest shopping day of the year because people had to go buy replacements for stuff Santa had stolen , the stores would have just what people needed . <p> She had better put Brewster down . If she carried him much longer maybe Santa would sniff out the stink of her concern on him . <p> She put him on the mantel , right near the spot where they always left milk and cookies . She tried to make it seem as if she wanted Santa to take Brewster . That was part of her reverse psychology too , but it fueled her worry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better go play with the toys she liked least . <p> Mike looked at his Tonka truck and let out a howl . " I 'm sick of this ! " he yelled . " I do n't want Santa taking one more thing from me ! " <p> " Shhh ! " said Janie . " He knows if you 've been naughty . " <p> " I do n't care ! " Mike said . " He always takes everything anyway , even when I 've been good ! I 'd like to catch him and take away everything he likes , see how he feels about it ! " <p> " Oh , Mike ! " Janie breathed , awed by the idea . <p> Everyone left their front door unlocked on Subtraction Eve . It was a rule . If Santa tried your front door and found it locked , he reported your family to the IRS . Santa might drive a hyper-toad-drawn sleigh , and steal all your favorite things , but nobody wanted to be reported to the IRS : unlike Santa , the auditors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One year there had been a rash of burglaries on Subtraction Eve . All those unlocked doors ! All the burglars had been caught . Janie heard they had been fed to Santa 's hyper-toads . This gave her pause . <p> " We would n't be burglars , " Mike said . " Catching Santa is n't like stealing from other people . Or maybe it 's just stealing from other people after they 've been robbed . " <p> " Fed to toads , " Janie said meditatively . <p> " We 'll wear masks , " Mike said . " He 'll never know who did it . " <p> " He knows whose house it is , persimmon-brain . " <p> They looked at each other . Is this worth it ? Janie wondered . She stared at the presents on her desk , all the really cool stuff she had gotten for her birthday . A big sketch pad  --  her mom had told her if she drew on all the pages before Subtraction she would be able to keep it , and she had doodled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thirty-six with colors like aquamarine and celestial blue and crimson and scarlet and chartreuse . She liked the paper and pens so much she was sure she could n't keep them . Mike had given her a stuffed alligator , and she loved that too , though she had tried not to . She 'd named it Wally , even though naming things was a bad idea . Daddy had given her a doll this year , a really neat one she 'd seen advertised on TV and had asked for specifically : Talk Back Jack . He came with three outfits : mountain climber , dirt bike rider , and cowboy . If you talked to him , he cussed you . All right , they were wimpy cusses , but still . <p> Usually she did n't get such neat stuff . <p> Mike sat on her bed and hugged his Tonka truck . <p> " Do you think he turns on the lights when he comes in ? " Janie said . <p> They put the trip wire about three feet from the front door so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janie held the big pillow case , and Mike held the electric cord . They sat across from each other , Mike just inside the living room entrance , Janie behind the coat rack in the front hall , and they waited . <p> Morn and Daddy had gone to bed an hour earlier , after putting Mike and Janie to bed . " Sleep well , sleep deep , sleep late , children , " Morn had said as she tucked them in . " Tomorrow afternoon we 'll go to a movie , how about that ? " <p> Janie grabbed Mom and gave her a big kiss . Toad food could n't go to the movies . <p> Splat-splat-splat-splat , splat-splat . Janie straightened , gripping the pillow case with both hands . Had to be toads in the driveway . <p> The front door opened slowly inward . Santa was muttering as he came in . " Blasted bug-grubbing flim-flamming distelfinks , " he growled , stumbling over the threshold as he grabbed for the front hall lightswitch and turned on the light . " Yowtch ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on him in an instant , pulling the pillow case down over his head , while Mike wrapped the cord around his wrists , binding his arms behind him . " Burning brands ! " cried the muffled Santa . His snatcher-sack had fallen as he fell . " Blistering boards ! " <p> Janie was panting . Fortunately this was a very small , skinny Santa , though all dressed in traditional red . <p> " Frag mag zigzag , " muttered Santa as Janie and Mike rolled him over . " Third time tonight ! What do you bleeping want ? " <p> " We want you not to take anything this year , Santa . " Janie said . <p> " Is that all you want ? " he said . He had a nice voice , Janie thought , confused . <p> " I want to see what 's in your bag , " Mike said . " I want to find something you really like and take it away from you . " <p> " I do n't , " said Janie . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " That 's not fair , " said Mike . <p> " Oh well , " said Santa . <p> " What do we have to do to get you to go away without stealing our stuff this year ? " Janie asked . <p> " There 's nothing you can do about it . " <p> " What if we just do n't let you go ? " <p> " You 're going to let me go , are n't you ? " <p> Well , this plan is n't working at all , Janie thought . " Are you going to feed us to your toads ? " <p> " No . Of course not . " <p> " You 're not going to tell the IRS on us , are you ? " <p> " How much taxes do you pay ? " <p> " None , " said Janie . <p> " There you go . " <p> " What about our parents ? " <p> " Did they help you plan this ? " <p> " No . " <p> " There you go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cord , Mike , " Janie said , pulling the pillow slip off Santa 's head . He blinked at her . He was awfully skinny , and had a lot of dark curls , all messy with being tripped and tied up , and he had very dark eyes . His eyes looked nice . How could Santa look nice ? <p> " I will not , " said Mike . He grabbed Santa 's snatcher-sack and reached into it . <p> " Do n't do that , " Santa said . He sounded depressed . <p> " Ouch ! " yelled Mike . He jerked his hand out of the sack . <p> " There you go , " said Santa tonelessly . " Got a future now , young man . " <p> The back of Mike 's hand was smoking . Mike began to cry : no sound , but tears rolled down his cheeks . <p> " What happened ? " asked Janie . <p> " He got the brand . He 's going to be a Santa when he grows up . What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa said . <p> Janie stared at him . Was he going to be nice , just this once , and let her keep what she most loved ? After she had tied him up ? Not likely . " My new doll , " she said , " Talk Back Jack . " <p> Santa sighed . He tensed his muscles . The cord broke and his hands were free . " I hate this job , " he said . He stood up , grabbed his snatcher-sack , and headed upstairs . <p> Janie went into the kitchen and got some ice . Tears were still welling up from Mike 's eyes . On the back of his hand , inflamed and red , was a jagged " S. " She rolled ice in a rag and gave it to Mike to press against the brand . <p> She poured milk , put some cookies on a plate , took cup and plate to the mantel . <p> Santa came back downstairs , his sack bulging . " Sorry about this , kids , " he said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate the cookies . " I hate this job . " He looked at Mike . <p> Mike sniffed . He said , " Do you get to play with the toys before you give them to someone else ? " <p> " I guess you could , if you wanted to , " Santa said . He cocked his head , eyed Brewster , glanced at Janie . I hate that doll , she thought as hard as she could . <p> Santa picked up Brewster . <p> Hate him , Janie thought . <p> Santa put Brewster back down and sighed . " You 're not going to try this again next year , are you ? " <p> Janie and Mike shook their heads . <p> " Good , " said Santa . He went out the front door . Janie and Mike watched as he climbed into his sleigh . The hyper-toads did a couple of limbering hops and then took off . <p> Janie watched until Santa was out of sight . Then she went and got Brewster , hugged him tight . She went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  even the underwear Grandma had sent was gone . There was a note , though , in six different colors , on a page torn out of her sketch pad . " Write me in the pen , " it said , and gave the address of the state prison . <p> Janie sighed and slipped the note into her desk drawer . <p> <p> By Robin Aurelian <p> Robin Aurelian is a rather reticent writer from Eugene , Oregon .
