In a certain mood  --  the one you drift into , say , while placidly taking in old episodes of The Brady Bunch  --  Abba can have its charms . Four pleasant Swedes chiming away in phrase-book English , their faces round and blank as aspirin : lower your resistance to chirpy pop marches , and in no time your favorite song is Waterloo . Drop your prejudice against Continental kitsch , and who can say no to Fernando ? Disarm your critical faculties , and Abba lays claim to the squishiest chambers of your heart , the parts susceptible to Dancing Queen . <P> Is that enough to explain the Abba revival , which is well under way in Europe and surfacing fast in America ? A greatest- hits collection , Gold , newly released in the U.S. , has already sold 5 million copies in Europe , where it was No. 1 on Billboard 's charts for months . Last year the glitterbug duo Erasure camped atop British charts with Abba-esque , a four-song CD tribute . Abba 's following reaches even to the scowling fringes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could make a smiley-face button look pensive by comparison . Abba impersonator Bjorn Again  --  eat your heart out , Elvis  --  keeps the torch burning in live performance . And at clubs last summer Dancing Queen found new life in a lengthy remix featuring a hefty bottom beneath a song that could otherwise be runway music at a Barbie fashion show . <P> Abba was always easy to enjoy , if you could just put aside the unnerving sense that they were hastening the decline of pop music into commercial calculation and mindless buoyancy ( not that much of a plunge to begin with ) . Because the band  --  composed of keyboard player Benny Andersson , his girlfriend ( later his wife ) Anni-Frid Lyngstad , guitarist Bjorn Ulvaeus and Bjorn 's wife Agnetha Faltskog  --  rarely toured , Abba could seem as featureless as a supermarket bar code . Even the name was an abstraction , an acronym made from the band members ' first initials . Like IBM . <P> And like IBM , they were huge . After the breakup of the Beatles , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen Top 40 hits in the U.S. alone . Their mammoth international popularity just made them seem more ominous to rock purists . Could there be such a thing as a steamroller made of mush ? For one thing , they had a way of making English sound like Esperanto . ( " The judges will decide/ The likes of me abide/ Spectators of the show/ Always laying low "  --  what does that mean , exactly ? ) And their famous choiring sound , exalted but weirdly anonymous , could have been the ambient hum from some bland consumer Utopia , a room-temperature limbo of airline food and spandex and unisex haircuts . <P> At their height , their sound penetrated everywhere . ( Nelson Mandela , who was a prisoner on Robben Island for their entire career , once called them his favorite group . ) But by 1982 their marriages had done a Fleetwood Mac . Amid the discontents that followed , Abba twittered to a close . Bjorn and Benny went on to write the stage musical Chess , with its hit single One Night in Bangkok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
