When I was a boy , my grandmother clutched my chin and said , " Promise me one thing . That you 'll never let that mother of yours buy a Mercedes . " I promised . It was easy . There was no chance of our buying anything . We filled out sweepstakes for an hour every night that we sent away with stamps that should have been our rent money . " You 're Jewish . Do n't you ever forget it , " she said . <p> My grandmother never considered that I might someday own a car . I was a seven-year-old Noah in a wheelchair with osteo-genesis imperfecta , short and wrong and big-headed . I 'd already had thirty-one fractures . She was sure as she was of everything that I would never drive . <p> And here I was buying German , not a car but a van , and one custom-made . It was Kempf , not Mercedes , but if she were alive , she 'd raise her eyebrows and want to know what Kempf was doing during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if that made a difference . I could have explained , I suppose , to Owens , but Owens was thick about religion . He was dumb with ethnicity , too , except his own . He was adopted , and all he knew was one of his parents was Arab . He could seem vaguely charmed if a young guy he was thinking of hiring or a woman he wanted a date with was Lebanese , but nothing much . If the guy was n't that good or the woman was n't that pretty , it was Lebanese schmebanese . When I told him I was Jewish , he said , " Really ? Does that make a big difference to you ? You know me , I do n't notice those things . " I always ascribed that to his being adopted . Maybe it was , maybe it was n't . With him you never knew . <p> I was the one to find the child curled up asleep in his garden , because I went looking for someone to show my new prize to . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd gotten the call that morning from his secretary , Ileene , green-eyed Ileene . I asked if he wanted to go see it or inspect it or anything , and without him ever getting on the line , Ileene told me no , it 's your track , just enjoy it . <p> This was so new . Genesis had gone public three years ago , and Owens had had a party then , but until today when the van came to me out of thin air , I had n't really registered that Owens was rich . <p> The morn-more had to take me to pick it up . My sister , Michelle , and I called her the mom-mom whenever she did something motherly . When we were growing up , she was always telling us she was n't like all the rest of these mom-moms , she did n't have free time and free money . It was an hour drive to the lot in San Jose , but then we saw the van and it was everything . She loved it , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth door . We 'd never had a car that nice . My grandmother did n't have to worry . We were rich twice , from boyfriends , but never long enough . <p> I had to ask the morn-more , after a few minutes , if I could be alone with it . <p> " Do you want me to go and come back ? You do n't want to have a sandwich or something ? " When I was young , each time she bought me a new chair , it was a big deal , and something we did alone , without Michelle . And each chair , the day I first used it , felt wonderful and strong , as if there 'd be no more long afternoons roaming Telegraph Avenue on a loaner while we waited for the shop to repair it . After we picked the chair up , she would n't take me back to school right away . She gave me the day to get used to it first , and the two of us always went and celebrated with a crab sandwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a friend 's basement . But I was twenty-two now , with an administrative job . <p> " I think I better get going , " I said . <p> It was sleek , fully automatic . Deep navy blue . It was male . It had cost fifty thousand dollars , and it had that shine and technology . At the press of a button on the key , a ramp drew down from the driver 's floor , with handlebars on both sides . I leveraged myself up , pushed the chair to the back . There was a way to make the ramp lift automatically , but I was going to discipline myself . ! would n't use more help than what I needed . Little eases were the first treats on the long slide down to the bed . <p> The brake and gears , everything was manned on top , with switch bars . I did n't have to use my feet . I 'd learned to drive on our old Pontiac , with the metal extension bars you can buy , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string puppets . The last few years I 'd been using BART and the buses . <p> Owens had ordered the car complete . It even had a phone . I had to stop thinking even . I would get used to having things now . I 'd hoped it would have a phone , but I did n't ask . I still did n't touch it . I 'd heard that the bills for car phones were outrageous , and I did n't know when the charges started . Maybe if you just picked it up . I had an underdeveloped sense of money . I thought a phone call from a car could cost a hundred dollars or a thousand . <p> My dead grandmother 's prohibition made the leather richer , the roof grand , the luxury more ... voluptuous . <p> When the morn-morn drove away in our old Pontiac and I was alone , high up in all that space , I clapped . I got something good for once . Top of the line . I said to myself , out loud , I lucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just pure chance , like a lottery . Or maybe because of me . This seemed like the first time ever . <p> The dealer walked back and gave me my license and my one other ID , and that was all . I never knew how easy it was to buy things . <p> " I can go now ? " I said . <p> " She 's all yours , " he said , tapping my roof . <p> I wanted to do something that was the way I felt , and so I started driving . The van came with a full tank of gas . I knew everybody at work was going crazy today  --  a group from Belgium was there , visiting  --  and I did n't want to just park the van and have to forget it . I went up Skyline towards Santa Cruz . I found myself in the hills , parking in a blue space in front of a stucco church , across from the Ice Cream Ballroom . I pressed open the ramp , rolled down , and crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never done that before alone , without someone else 's patience and scrutiny . Whims are different if you 're watched . And I was unwatched . Independent . Next door was a record place and I bought two CDs . The van had a CD player . I was cooking . It was two-thirty . I decided to blow off work until tomorrow . Nobody 's care . I took 280 , just because . Why not ? I was in no hurry now and it 's a beautiful road and then , all of a sudden , I could n't contain myself alone anymore . I had to show someone . Olivia was still living at Owens 's place then , so I took the exit into the woods and headed up there . <p> It occurred to me after I rounded the first bend , driving on rich people 's land , that this van was my first charity . I should have done it a lot sooner . I felt big . Not like I 'd thought . I 'd thought it humbled you . We 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made us all feel bad . It was never enough to make much difference . The way my mother was , when a neighbor or someone she knew from work gave her old clothes for my sister and me , she never said no . She never thought we could afford to rum down anything . But the van was new and clean . I was higher than other people on the road and controlling motion from above . ! was masterful , and it felt due me , even overdue me , this power . <p> But elation on this planet can not last . The best part of the day was that first driving . At Owens 's place , I remembered , getting in and getting out was still hard . I went from on high to being a man in a frame . I had to leverage myself down slowly , so as not to skid . I 'd build up muscles , I decided . In my arms , which were my two favorite parts of myself . I was weak now from four years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful and still , like a cemetery . The gates creaked and banged , loose on their old hinges . He 'd bought it from the estate of the Copper King , who had acquired the land to build a weekend house . All over the yard he 'd planted outscale copper beeches . But the architecture was a joke . The King had lived hard and died quietly in San Francisco . No one had ever lived in this house before Owens . It was not built to be lived in . It was a party house . <p> And Owens was anything but a party . He hosted events , but never here . All his celebration tied to business and was held in office buildings or rented ballrooms . Once , he told me , he 'd had nine Japanese businessmen here for dinner , and when they 'd arrived the people who cook for him had the places set , but there was one setting without a chair . They 'd checked everywhere in the house , and there were only nine chairs . Owens even ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never met , to knock on their door and ask to borrow a chair . They had parrots in cages outside their front door , huge foreign-squawking parrots . But no one answered . So the nine Japanese men sat around the table , and Owens stood . Even so , before the meal was out , one of the nine chairs broke , and a businessman fell with a dull noise to the tile floor . So now , there were twelve wooden chairs around the dining-room table , ordered the next day . <p> Wind went through the leaves , and the huge trees swayed like ferns , making sounds you only hear in an abandoned place . <p> Sometimes gardeners worked the yard , but I did n't see anyone today . For around the house , Owens always found the worst people . It 's odd , because he must have known how to hire for work . The whole place seemed dug up and scarred . They were supposed to be putting in an orchard . He was big on that . He wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he planned to walk out in the evening and pick his fruit . But you just knew it was going to be a long time before he bit into his own apple , and when it all happened , a million dollars from now , the apples would be better from the A &P.; <p> Trees , their roots still bundled in burlap sacks , leaned slant , waiting to be set in . Expensive trees . Everything here looked like a mess of process . Nothing was ever done . <p> I opened the front door . They did n't lock . He had millions of dollars of art he could n't insure because he would n't get security devices or even lock his own front door . Olivia 'd told me that . He did n't talk about money . Once he showed me his storage room . It was like an archive of himself : posters , marquees , magazine articles , boxes and boxes of mementos of the early days at Genesis . A plaque from when they first went public . It was all just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes in the empty room off the entry hall . I told him he should file the stuff , take care of it . He looked at me , he 'd been showing me , digging the pictures out of piles and boxes for more than an hour , and said , " It 's probably better if all this gets destroyed in a fire or something . I think you should n't live with all this stuff . " He could be wise about himself . He understood what in his life was a danger . <p> " Hello ! " I yelled . It was cold in the house because it was dark . No one answered , but that did n't mean Olivia was n't home . The place was so big you could n't hear . I wheeled through the dim living room  --  how not to build a house  --  they were alone here , on top of a hill , and still , almost no light came into the dining room , the falling-down kitchen they 'd never fixed . A piece of ceiling was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About a thousand cherry tomatoes , yellow and red , spilled out over the counter . I popped one ; it tasted warm like sun . <p> I went to the steps that ran up to their bedroom and shouted , " Olivia . " Nothing . <p> O.K. She was either in town or asleep and hungover , tangled in white sheets on the futon . But if she could n't hear me , there was nothing I could do . The only way up in this place was the stairs or the old dumbwaiter . She was probably in town . Normally you could trace her from her car . She had a white vintage Thunderbird , her one luxury . But it was in the shop again so it not being here meant nothing . Olivia was one of those people who was everywhere when you were n't looking for her , you 'd run into her twice a day , but when you needed her she was hard to find . She did n't exactly have a job . She worked free-lance , and so could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtyard instead of through the house again . Big overgrown runners for squash scored the ground , the flowers browned and limp . Bees accumulated free around the berry bushes . And in the dip where the garden fell to a carrot patch , in among the overgrown lacy tops , was a kid curled up in the dirt . It was a girl , asleep . ! nudged her with my rubber wheel . <p> " Hello , " she said , coming awake . She sat up , most of her weight in her butt , like a top , settling to rest . She rubbed her eyes . " Are you a midget ? <p> " Who are you , little girl ? " <p> " I 'm Jane , " she said . <p> " And how old are you ? " " Nine . " <p> " You 're nine . Do you know the difference between a midget and a dwarf and a regular man ? " <p> " There is no difference . I mean a midget or a dwarf are both a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a midget if I 'm a man ? " <p> " I 'm sorry . Do you live here ? " <p> " What would you do if I said yes ? " <p> " My father 's supposed to live here , but I do n't think you 're my father because I 've seen my father before and my mom has a picture of him . I guess he could have moved . " She sighed . " I 'm hungry . " <p> I looked over the garden . <p> " Sick of fruit . I 've been eating this stuff already . It 's not very good . And there 's snails . " <p> " What 's your father 's name ? " <p> " Tom Owens . " <p> That stopped me good . I 'd known him for four years and he 'd never said a word about any child . In fact , he talked a lot about wanting to get married and have a baby . I wondered if he knew she existed . Olivia sure did n't . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where did you come from ? " <p> " I came from , do you know Brownsfield ? It 's on the other side of the mountains . I lived there with my mom . " <p> " And where 's your mother now ? " <p> " She 's there still . " <p> " She 's still there . Then how did you get here ? " <p> " I drove . But that 's kind of a secret . " <p> " O.K. I wo n't tell . But , tell you what , your father 's at work now . Why do n't I take you home where I live and you can clean up and we can go get you some new clothes , you got a little dirty sleeping here , I 'll take you to get something to eat and we 'll call your dad and he can come get you when he 's ready . " <p> " Great , " she said , fast . " I mean , I have some clothes already in the car . In the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Probably my favorite thing . " <p> " Well , we can take your stuff and maybe get you one new thing besides . A dress or something . " So I guess this is it , I was thinking . This is what happens when you fall into an adventure . She got up and walked with a hand light on my shoulder . With me in the chair and her standing , she was a few inches taller . She led me to her truck , behind the eucalyptus . It was an incredible thing : an old , perfectly shaped Ford truck , browned and weathered and patched , full of rust . Originally it must have been cream-colored with the wide spaced four letters still maroon . I was dying to see inside , it was such a relic , but she just opened her door , used her hands to pull herself up on the seat , and climbed in the way I would have to , and came back out with a brown grocery bag folded down at the top , like a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh neat , " she said , when the ramp came down . " Like a drawbridge to a castle . " I told her it was my first day in it . I did n't say that her alleged father bought the van for me . I just did n't want to . That day , the two of us named it the Van Castle . " And that makes you the Count Van Castle , " she said . <p> I asked her if she wanted to go home and call her father first or if she 'd rather get something to eat . <p> " Eat , " she said . <p> I took her to a place I never went . Now ! did n't want to go anywhere Olivia could be . I wanted to keep my discovery to myself for a while . There was a time when I 'd been half in love with Olivia . Some days that seemed unbearable to me , the humiliation , and I thought we should never speak to each other again . Other days it seemed almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right now it felt perfectly all right . Many men , perhaps a hundred , had been in my position with Olivia . What did it matter ? They all went on to live decent lives . <p> There was an old-fashioned soda shop no one I knew would go to because the food was full of grease . Olivia , Owens , my sister , Michelle , they were all health people . Except when it came to ethnicity . They 'd eat Mexican food fat but they would n't touch a french fry . Except Owens . You had to grant him consistency but that made him even more of a pain in the ass . It gave me true pleasure to buy Owens 's daughter a cheeseburger and watch her eat it with relish , pressing the thing flat in her hands . <p> Then I took her to the mall . It is a wonderful world . I 'd never bought a girl clothing before . I 'd been on the boys ' floor of department stores and there I shopped for men 's clothes in miniature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just ladies ' in small sizes . They had a whimsy all their own . I had a credit card , I 'd just got it a few months ago . I could do this . Be an adult . <p> She was nine years old , and hopping around from outfit to outfit . Given the poor quality of what she had on now ( her yellow stretch pants , muddy from washing , a ragged hole in one knee , and her slippers scuffed ) , she obviously had no money . I had to wonder about the mother , wherever she was . She had to be someplace . The kid could n't have driven alone . Not over mountains . I still could n't really fathom how she 'd arrived there . The mother must be hiding . Jane was looking at the skirt of a dress and then up to me . She expected me to pay . <p> Just that assumption , that I was an adult she could look to , that melted me . I could have bought her the whole store and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I had n't discovered the extraordinary thing about this child . Even dirty , recently hungry , obviously poor , she was clairvoyant in her renunciation . <p> I told her to fetch what she wanted . I watched her brush the sleeve of a velvet coat , then relinquish it . She picked out a cotton dress and socks and new sneakers . " Is it too much ? " she said . <p> " Not at all , " I answered . " I was thinking , you need a headband . " I showed her an orange one with crenelations . " Go try it on . " I motioned to the salesgirl to include that velvet coat while Jane ran back to look at herself in the mirror . The woman wrapped it on the bottom of the bag . <p> We decided to go home . We were both withering . I 'd wanted to stop and get her a book to read in case I did n't have enough to amuse her with and at the grocery store to buy cookies , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again at home . <p> " Van Castle , " she said . " And we 're the Von Castles . Jane Von Castle , how do you do . " <p> An hour later she was murmuring in my bathtub , and I called her father from the kitchen . It was my second conversation of the day with Ileene . She told me kindly but firmly that he was in a meeting at the plant if he had n't left already , and that then he 'd be seeing architects for the new office building most of the afternoon . <p> " Ileene , I have something important . For him . It 's about his life , " I said . I wanted to tell Ileene , she was a good woman , near forty but a runner , vastly underemployed , so much that I 'd always wondered what he paid her . She could be trusted with more than he could , but he was such an odd man , with privacies . <p> " I 'll tell him , Noah . " <p> " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I sure will . There 's nothing I can do for you in the meantime ? Is the van running all right ? " <p> " Oh yeah , it 's perfect . Nothing like that . " <p> I got off the phone because the girl was yelling from the bathroom  --  did I have any bubble bath ?  --  which I did n't . <p> " How about dish soap ? " she yelled back . That I had and delivered , and with it she conjured a spa of bubbles off the end of a spoon . I did n't know you could do that out of dish soap . <p> Back in the kitchen , I sat in the middle of the floor listening to her small , uncertain , rising hum . I remembered being a child and being washed , sitting in the high , old , deep kitchen sink . People probably do n't do that anymore . Or was that because of me ? The way I was . But no , I remembered my sister , too , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed at the knees . My sister has red hair , and her legs , when she was growing up , were covered with freckles and pink scars . <p> I 'd left all the towels I had clean on the toilet seat , and a half hour later she emerged , combing out her hair . <p> " You did n't know that , Noah , that detergent is like bubble bath ? Sure , Noah , it 's just suds , " she said . <p> " Do you drink tea ? " I really did n't know what children ate . <p> " Sure . " <p> We sat at my table and ate a box of graham crackers with tea . That was most of what I had . <p> " Did you call my dad ? " <p> I told her I 'd asked his secretary to have him call me . " But I did n't mention that you were here . I did n't know if I should . Is he expecting you ? Or is your visit a surprise ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sighed , a private syntax . <p> I was ready for a nap , but she wanted to know if I had games . Games , something a person should probably have . Monopoly , chess , even Chinese checkers . I 'd get them . I had a lot of movies , though . I showed her the library of movies I 'd taped from television . She picked out Peter Pan . And we sat and watched . I made a batch of Jiffy Pop . Outside the sky was dark and then it was raining . I gave her one of my sweatshirts and a pair of my wool socks for over her clothes . She lay on my bed and I sat in my chair watching . <p> Before Peter Pan was over , she fell asleep . I covered her with the soft wool plaid blanket , slipped the tape out , and went into the kitchen to read . I wondered what I 'd do for dinner . He would n't necessarily call before then . It was an evening not to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had eggs in the refrigerator and a health food pancake mix from Olivia , maple syrup . That would be enough . We did n't have milk , but we had tea . She seemed to like the tea . <p> " What if he does n't call ? " she said , in a normal voice from the other room . I rolled into the doorjamb . <p> " You 'll stay here , " I said . " Are you hungry for some dinner yet ? " <p> " In a little while , " she said . <p> Late that night , when she was asleep on my bed and I was on the couch with the extra blanket , Owens called . " Hey , have you seen Olivia ? " <p> I told him no , I had n't seen Olivia all day . I tried to keep my voice down . <p> " Really ? ' Cause I thought she might be with you . You know , I 'm a little worried , Noah . She 's not here , she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she was probably over there or out somewhere with you . I 'm really a little worried . And I guess I 'm pretty disappointed in her , too . We had a fight last night , and we were gon na meet for dinner after work today at our sushi place , you know , to talk about it and just to have dinner and I got there and I was fifteen minutes late and she 'd left . " <p> I did n't say anything . He made no mention that I 'd called him . I knew Ileene gave him the message . <p> " She just left . I could n't believe it . So , I have no idea where she is . " <p> " Well , Owens , I was n't calling you about Olivia . " <p> I heard the light tap of computer keys near him . <p> " I called because I went looking for her today at your place and I found a kid who says you 're her father . She was waiting for you . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Jane . " <p> " Oh , no , that kid . She was at Hillsborough ? What was she doing there ? Did you see her mother ? Woman about thirty , kind of crazy . " <p> " No woman . There 's a truck at your place , but no mother . " <p> " Yeah , they 've got a truck . That 's her . I know her mom . And she 's not my kid . Listen , I 'll have to deal with her , I 'm sure I 'll hear from her more soon and we 'll see what she wants , but I ca n't tonight , I 've got to find Olivia , would you mind just keeping her for me there a day or so and I 'll come get her and straighten it all out when I get a chance . " <p> " Sure , Owens . I guess so . But why does she think she 's your daughter ? " <p> " Well , it 's a long story , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with a lot of guys at one point and then when she had the kid , they all kinda split and so she decided that I was the dad . And I 'm pretty sure she 's not my kid but I had to decide , if I did n't agree to be her father , she would n't have a father . So I kind of help them out some . I see her sometimes . " <p> " So she knows you as her father ? " <p> " Did she say that ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " You think she looks like me ? " <p> " I do n't know . No , not really . " <p> " I know . I do n't either . Noah ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Do you have any idea where Olivia might be ? You 're telling me the truth ? " <p> " No , but if I hear from her , I 'll tell her you 're looking for her .

" <p> " What did he say ? " <p> " He said to tell you he loved you a lot . " She was a foot in front of me then and dense in the dark . I sensed a change in her when she heard that . She seemed to become an inch or two shorter . Her tension fell . She was loose , and I smarted for the lie . <p> " Is he coming to see me ? " <p> " Not tonight . Maybe not for a couple days . He asked if I would take care of you until he can come . Is that all fight with you ? " <p> She had one foot on the other knee , perplexed . " I guess . Sure .

I worked hard : it was n't like me to remember the names and addresses of fun . But we visited the Mechanical Museum , we put quarters in the telescopes at the Cliff House to see communal seals on rocks . We watched Golden Gate Park 's last buffalos move infinitesimally slowly , we went through the aquarium and the museum , and then we collapsed at the Japanese garden and ordered four portions at once of cookies and tea . ! got into the habit of planning our meals in advance . ! worried about money , in moments of darkness , at night or in the movies . I was spending more than I ever did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our spoons scraped the bottom glass of our sundaes at Sweet Dreams afterwards . I understood for the first time how people spent their money . Money was worth this . She was not demanding , she hardly asked . I had to guess what she might need and offer . <p> I did n't know how long I was budgeting for . You never knew with Owens . ! was trying to figure out if we could go on forever . I thought we could . Because I 'd go back to work and get her in school . We would n't be out celebrating every day . This was just for now when we did n't know anything . And by the third day we were wearing out from fun . We missed our normal lives . I did , even though I hated my job and planned to quit as soon as I got something better . I planned to be out of there for sure by fall . I had applications in to schools all across the country , in New York City , even . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't say anything but I could tell . Excitement was n't meant for every day and she was tired . When we drove out of the park , full with warm tea , we passed a Catholic School on Eighteenth Avenue , and students poured out in uniforms , underdressed , energetic , shouting . She turned away from the window so they could n't see her . <p> " Do you miss school ? " I said . <p> " I miss my friends . " <p> " What grade are you in ? " <p> " I was in third . And I miss my mother . " The left side of her face went lopsided . <p> " Well , tonight we have to call her . " It was the opening I 'd been waiting for , but she just turned back towards the window now and shook her head . <p> By that evening I was worried about her studies . We went to the campus bookstore and I bought a math book , a science book , and what seemed to me two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and after , we cleared the table and she worked on her books for an hour . <p> While she read , I got out a clean notebook and began to think with a pencil about our lives . I 'd called Owens again today . At the tea garden , I 'd said I had to go to the bathroom . Ileene told me she 'd given him my messages . But whatever Owens did , he was n't going to take Jane . He could n't have a kid . He 'd never be home . The cooks would have to raise her . His cooks were nice enough people , but she would be lonely in that cold house . He only allowed about five types of vegetables and fruit in the kitchen . They did n't have milk , he did n't believe in flour , he forbade meat and most of the things you need for a regular life . <p> Still , there was the mother . Of course she 'd want to go back to her mother . I asked her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page , if she 'd like to call her mother . <p> " No . " <p> " Did you have a fight ? " <p> " No , " she said . <p> " Well , you can use the phone to call her whenever you want . And if you need privacy , just tell me . " <p> Then I began to think about us and whether I could keep her . She could go to school , there was a school down the street that was supposed to be good . If I only got into a college somewhere here . But who would pick her up at three o'clock ? Before , I 'd thought if I did n't get in here , maybe I 'd move to New York City . I 'd thought I just might do that . But now I would n't . There were a thousand reasons to stay here , and this was the last , the one that mattered . Berkeley was the place I 'd first been happy . I did n't want to leave . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here and make a career , but it could be done and now I had a reason . I 'd shop Saturday mornings and cook every night . We had to have food in the house . On what I got from my job now we could do it . And if I got a scholarship or job at school , that would help , and my savings would be over and above . <p> Pretty soon we 'd need a bigger apartment , so she could have friends come , maybe a birthday party . But for now , we could make it work here . <p> I was scribbling numbers , and when I looked up , she was staring , rubbing her eyes . <p> " I 'm pretty tired . I guess I should go to sleep . " <p> I looked at my watch . It was ten o'clock . No wonder . <p> " Jane , I 'm thinking I should take you and get you registered in school tomorrow . Your dad 's pretty busy , I guess , and I 'm wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about seeing each other , you could always stay here . " <p> " Thank you , " she said . <p> " Would you mind that ? " <p> " No , " she said . " Can I go brush my teeth now ? " <p> Registering a child in school is n't easy . They want proof , they want papers . You 'd have thought I 'd kidnapped her . They needed her birth certificate , which we retrieved from an envelope she 'd come with , safety-pinned to the inside of her original blouse . The piece of paper said Jane Mary Hudson , born to her mother , Mary di Natale . Two inked whorls of baby feet marked the page . But when we returned to the principal 's Office with this document , they said I still needed proof of guardianship . <p> Through all this I tried to get her to call her mother . She just shook her head and said there was no telephone . <p> When we returned home , there were two envelopes for me in the mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other was New York . Before this , I 'd only had jobs where you called them back to see if they 'd hire you . I 'd never had letters in the mail . I did n't even let myself look . I put them in a drawer before she noticed , and then I called Owens again . Now I was mad . I left another message saying URGENT with Ileene . And he came over that night , unannounced , in jeans and hiking boots , loping in his stride over the lawn . <p> " Hello-o ? " he called , reaching a hand in through our open window . Her head was up in a shot from the table where she was drawing , but all she said was , " Hi , Owens , " as if he were the most average thing in her world . This was not what Owens liked to hear . You could see his physical agitation . He was a man accustomed to people fussing . <p> " Hey , bud , " I said , knocking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have any fresh fruit juice ? " <p> " Nope . I have tea and milk . And water . " <p> " Oh , no thanks , " he said , " So , kid , you want to get your stuff together and I 'll take you home with me . I 'm really tired . I had a really rough day . I talked to your mom , and she 's gon na take a plane here tomorrow . " <p> " You talked to my mom ! " <p> " I talked to your mom and she 'll come in at around four o'clock or four-thirty and tomorrow night we can all sit down and figure out where you two want to live and where you 'll go to school . I think it 's probably a pretty good idea if we find you and your mom an apartment somewhere around here . So tonight I 'll take you home and you can have a little vacation there tomorrow while I 'm at work . Vanessa and Terry are these people who help me out around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure you get something to eat and you can just read and relax in the garden and watch movies . Maybe we 'll even watch a movie tonight . " <p> " O.K. Cool , " she said . <p> In five minutes they were gone , her strapped into the low seat of his sports car , her few belongings in the narrow back . I still had n't given her the velvet coat , I 'd been waiting , so when I packed her things I slipped it in the bottom of the bag . His car fired up and then sped off into the night . <p> And then , the depression came on again , in a way it had before but I 'd forgotten and only now remembered . I sat outside in my chair in the cool night , the two envelopes from the drawer in my lap . One envelope was thick , one thinner . Because why should Owens have everything , just because he already did ? People in the world who had too much got more , and those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have themselves . And Owens did n't deserve her , he would n't know how to cherish a child . I 'd often envied him his women , but now it seemed I would not be up for that , anyway . Sex was too high for me . For now , anyway . I was tired . The fog soothed my forehead , I could feel my curls tightening against my neck . But I could have taken care of a child . I could . I had begun to learn , and I had things to teach . <p> And what would Owens give ? <p> He had slept with a woman and then tried to get her to go away . And that was what made men fathers and men in this world . <p> I sat there for a long time that night , looking at the various stars in the sky , the bright points , the dimmer , the ones that seemed spent , leaving trails like flecks of chalk . Now I was free to go where I needed . I rubbed the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the lawn , the van was still there , and it was mine . <p> <p> By Mona Simpson <p> Mona Simpson is the author of two novels , Anywhere But Here and The Lost Father .
