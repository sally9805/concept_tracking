' T is the season to be jowly . After pursuing the youth market most of the year , Hollywood devotes December to prestige films aimed not at the huge post- Christmas audience but at the senior citizens in the Motion Picture Academy . The goal is a batch of Oscar nominations ; the reality is a glut of ambitious pictures that give no one a very merry Christmas . Of seven holiday movies , all but one ignore Hollywood 's hard-learned rules of storytelling : <P> A Life Is Not an Epic . When David Lean died , did he take the secret of epic movies with him ? Lean knew that life is full of dramatic events , but it 's what 's inside that counts ; the enthralling vistas matter less than the interior vision . That lesson is lost on Hollywood , whose idea of epic biography is a story of a big shot ( Gandhi , Bugsy Siegel , Malcolm X ) who got shot . Violent death is meant to lend tragic grandeur . <P> Hence Hoffa , an utterly externalized view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James R. Hoffa . The R stood for Riddle , and David Mamet 's lean script is content to leave him at that . Hoffa does stuff  --  bullies management , connives with the Mob  --  but who is he ? The movie gives not a clue . Jack Nicholson looks eerily like his subject , and he has the abrupt gestures and staccato voice of a man who overcomes lack of eloquence by force of will . But director Danny DeVito , who also plays Hoffa 's closest ally , gets way too fond of slo-mo shots and swooping cameras ; instead of a hard-edge portrait , we get painting on velvet . It 's epic-style vamping around the void of epic character . <P> If You Must Make an Epic , Be Sure You Have the Right Subject . Genius is one- tenth inspiration and nine-tenths obsession . Chaplin makes you think it is ten-tenths passivity , a matter of landing in the right place at the right time . So Richard Attenborough 's film breaks new ground . Instead of casting Charlie Chaplin in an unnaturally heroic mold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life as if it belonged to someone else . <P> All the things that shaped the immortal mime  --  his Victorian sentimentality ( of which his passion for underage girls was the most obvious , least agreeable part ) , his pretense to intellectuality , the torments of his vast celebrity  --  are only vaguely alluded to . These are tough topics , wrong for the form ( and indulgent attitude ) Attenborough has chosen . Robert Downey Jr. , who plays Chaplin , might have been up to them , but this episodic film gives him only cautious scenes , not an incautious character , to play . <P> A Movie Sound Track Should Be Accompanied by a Movie . The Leap of Faith album is a little masterpiece of gospel music , mixing the real thing ( as performed by the Angels of Mercy , Patti LaBelle , Albertina Walker ) with soulful tributes from pop acolytes ( John Pagano , Wynonna Judd , Lyle Lovett ) . But the movie , like The Bodyguard , does n't live up to the craft or fervor of its music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )  --  he promises " miracles and wonders " while lining his pockets with the gullible hopes of decent people  --  ca n't even take energy from Martin 's holy rants and amazing body wit .
