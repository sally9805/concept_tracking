<p> ' BADGES <p> OF HONOR ' <p> Editor  --  Regarding your recent article , " Draft Dodging in Perspective " ( Chronicle , February 7 ) , I offer another point of view , especially to those too young to have personally experienced the Vietnam War era . <p> Contrary to the slant of the article and specific declarations by a certain Cheryl Russell , there were indeed many millions of Americans who supported the war and 2.5 million Americans who , reluctantly or not , served in Vietnam . Most responded as had their fathers and uncles that heeded the call to arms for World War I , World War II and the Korean War . Ms. Russell is quoted , " We all thought the Vietnam War was immoral . It was a badge of honor to admit that you were a homosexual , a drug addict or deaf to get out of the draft . You were considered a fool if you let yourself go to Vietnam . " <p> These self-serving rationales are an insult to every person that has ever worn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost loved ones . A more honest assessment would be to recognize that very few 18-year-olds possess the maturity to debate the political and moral contradictions of some far-off conflict . Most young men simply registered as required by law and out of a sense of patriotic duty . <p> I 'll be willing to bet that many who readily lied or faked homosexuality or drug addiction to avoid the draft were amongst the most ardent supporters of Desert Storm now that their own butts were n't on the line . Furthermore , I believe that if one looks beneath these self-appointed " badges of honor " a distinct yellow streak will be evident . <p> Having served three tours in ' Nam with the Marine Corps , it was also evident that most of us would prefer to be safely at home , but would rather face death once than live with cowardice forever . <p> R. C. ALEXIA <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> EDUCATED APE <p> Editor  --  I would like to respond to Mark Clementi 's letter ( Chronicle , February 14 ) . He states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our best and brightest , we 're in more trouble than we realize . " Be realistic , Mark . Half of the eligible voters never go to the polls . Of the half that do go 50 percent believe only what they see on television . If you had enough money to buy all the television time you wanted you could elect Art Hoppe 's educated ape , and sometimes I think we have . <p> PERRY J. RABLIN <p> Colusa <p> . <p> ENDANGERED SPECIES <p> Editor  --  I am a commercial salmon fisherman . I ply the coastal waters of our state with hook and line . I do not use harmful gill nets , injure dolphins or fin sharks . I supply a product that is free of hormones , chemicals and red dyes ( unlike farmed fish ) . Salmon fishing , both sport and commercial , was once a valuable contributor to California 's economy . Now I am an endangered species . There were once over 5,000 commercial salmon vessels in our state , now down to less than 1,500 . <p> About the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salmon " Chronicle , February 11 ) , Susan Sutton blames the farmers ' predicament on the inflexibility of the Endangered Species Act . She states that this act favors fish over man . Wrong ! Saving fish is something we can do for ourselves . <p> A recovered fishery can contrib ute much more than the 3 percent that agribusiness contributes . There are corporations that buy small farms to collect government subsidies for growing cotton and rice . We do n't need these water intensive crops because there is a surplus and they go into storage . Believe me . These companies deliberately waste water to ensure a steady supply . <p> Please care enough to save fish and wildlife . If not for ourselves then for the children who will inherit this world . Someday soon if our sons and daughters ca n't cherish California 's wildlife it will be a sad day indeed . <p> LARRY F. SIMPSON <p> Larkspur <p> . <p> NUCLEAR PLANT REVIEWS <p> Editor  --  On February 6 the U.S. Senate voted , 52-43 , to take away citizens ' rights to public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one-step nuclear licensing " provision of the Johnston-Wallop energy bill is an insult to the principles of due process and the public 's right to know . <p> Senators Seymour and Cranston cast their votes with the citizens of our state instead of siding with the monied interests of the nuclear industry . <p> When energy legislation is considered in the House , we hope that our representatives will also choose safety and democracy over one-step licensing . <p> Congress should pass an energy policy that relies on energy efficiency , renewables and citizen participation in decision-making , rather than continuing our shortsighted reliance on nuclear and fossil fuels . <p> JULIE MILES , field director <p> California PIRG <p> Los Angeles <p> . <p> ABORTION RESULTS <p> Editor  --  Dr. Benson Roe ( Open Forum , January 31 ) is speaking only for himself in ascribing validity to " three viewpoints " on abortion  --  imposed , prohibited and optional . There are only two viewpoints because there are only two potential end results  --  a live child or a dead pre-born child . <p> Abortion was imposed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wade decision . Pregnant women are still as uninformed about the effects and results of abortion as they were before Roe vs . Wade and their lives are still as endangered by the doctor committing the abortion . <p> The doctor is the only one protected from the consequences of his actions . He is protected from criminal prosecution . Abortion is not optional for the pre-born child . <p> Human problems are not the result of " overpopulation " as suggested . Rather they are often the result of mistaken government policies . <p> CAMILLE GIGLIO , president <p> California Right to Life <p> Pleasant Hill <p> . <p> ALTA STREET LANDMARK <p> Editor  --  The building at the end of Alta Street on Telegraph Hill endangered by the recent rock slide is of considerable historical and architectural importance . <p> It was built in 1936 by Ian Hoeffler , one of the progenitors of the renaissance of Telegraph Hill , and is one of a few early functional-modern structures on the Hill which , in juxtaposition to the much earlier Gold Rusa-era houses nearby , has long helped define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most precious neighborhood . <p> Overlooking the lower Filbert Steps , and frequently photographed and painted , its residents have included such luminaries as Captain Steve Bancroft , a famous Pan Am pioneer China Clipper pilot , and the late , great Charles McCabe , Chronicle columnist and philosopher . The building was also shown in a 1955 movie , " Hell On Frisco Bay , " starring Hollywood giants Edward G. Robinson and Alan Ladd . <p> The building faces a Thursday deadline to be rebuilt or removed . Every effort should be made to save this important edifice , which last but not least , is in the Telegraph Hill Historic Preservation District , established in 1986 . <p> NEIL MALLOCH <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> MUNI 'S MESS <p> Editor  --  I find it really laughable that the people at Muni would even consider raising the fares to $ 1 and cut back on service at the same time . <p> First of all , who approved this , and second of all , why do they need this money ? The buses are filthy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about getting rid of the trash and crooks that ride the system . I have lived here all my life , and I keep seeing the fares go up , but no change in the system . <p> I do believe that it 's time for some serious house cleaning at Muni . Why not get rid of some of those high- paying positions for people there that do n't do a damn thing all day ? <p> MICHAEL E. GARDNER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> PARK OASIS , SANS AUTOS <p> Editor  --  Re : Restricting automobiles in Golden Gate Park . <p> In your February 18 editorial you state that the park " provides a verdant pastoral oasis . <p> " Exactly  --  and that oasis turns into a reality on Sunday , the one day in the week when cars are banned and Kennedy Drive ceases to become a speeding throughway . <p> If you go to the park on Sunday you sense the liberated euphoria of people walking , skating , picnicking , cycling and enjoying a few hours respite from the tyranny of carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco <p> HOLD THE PRAYERS <p> Editor  --  Will the people who have been praying for rain please stop for a few days ? <p> JACK GREEN <p> San Mateo
