A revelation missed by one person may be seen by another . That is why we need to be part of the community of believers . // BY THE TIME Jesus called his friend Lazarus back to life , he was drawing both faithful and skeptical followers wherever he traveled . He had given 12 of his followers power over demons and to heal diseases , and then he sent 72 more ahead of him to towns he was about to enter , announcing the nearness of the kingdom of God . Luke speaks of this as a time in which Jesus rejoiced in the fullness of the Spirit . " I praise Thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that Thou didst hide these things from the wise and intelligent and didst reveal them to babes . " Turning to his disciples , he continues , " Blessed are the eyes which see the things you see , for I say to you that many prophets and kings wished to see the things which you see , and did not see them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not hear them " ( 10:21-24 ) . The evidence of God 's presence-in miracles , in resurrection , in natural phenomena-however manifold , will never be proof enough for some . Seeing water turned into wine before their very eyes , they will remain blind to what has happened . Jesus is talking about two kinds of sight : physical and spiritual , the sight of the eyes and the sight of the heart . The one is common to all who look ; the other must be revealed . While the evidence of God 's hand in the ordinary may be obvious , sometimes overwhelming , if we are to experience even a small part of the revelation that filled Jesus with such joy we must be given eyes of faith and a disposition to see . In Jesus ' time , as now , so many wanted to experience a convincing sign . What were those hidden things Jesus spoke of that kings and prophets were denied ? They sat for hours waiting to find out . They attended his talks religiously . " Give us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overcome with feeling , called out from the crowd , " Blessed is the womb that bore you , and the breasts at which you nursed . " The crowd must have turned toward her attentively , must have sensed the urgency of her insight . They were not accustomed to hearing women speak about matters of the body in public gatherings . I imagine others around her beginning , with soft affection in their voices , to bless the mother of Jesus .... But Jesus seems to have known that the woman had become fixated on an earthly thing , a sign , which endangered her fuller understanding . He stops her well-intentioned homage to his mother , saying , " On the contrary , blessed are those who hear the word of God and observe it " ( Luke 11 : 27-28 ) . In addressing her I think Jesus is alluding to the difference between walking by sight and walking by faith . Maybe at that moment the veils that covered the eyes of her heart disintegrated , and she saw more clearly . I suspect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while longer , while she sulked and clung to what she could see of this world . We are tempted to trust a sign rather than that to which it points , to crave its power to convince rather than to unreasonably , sometimes even blindly , trust and obey the Word . Compare this admonition to the words Jesus spoke when he met up with the disciples he had sent ahead , whom he found marveling at the power they had seen manifest through their own acts . He says to them , " I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven . I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy ; nothing will harm you . However , do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you , but rejoice that your names are written in heaven " ( Luke 10 : 17-20 ; emphasis added ) . Jesus knows us too well . His words to both the woman and his disciples repeat the same caution . The visible world , the magnificent tangible experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavenly world to come . If we focused on the scorpion trampling and the spirit handling , we would devote ourselves to the show , ranking each other in order of demonstrable signs and wonders , and we would miss the invisible God . Yet , while urging transcendent sight , Jesus does not do away with the sign . He himself introduces the image of Satan falling from heaven . The iconoclast would sweep the house of any image in order to prevent the unsuspecting from falling under the sway of the visible world . The overzealous reformer would deny the Body of Christ contemporary manifestations of certain spiritual gifts and miracles , in fear that they would eclipse the giver of the gift . Instead , what if we were able to accept Jesus teaching that some people would be given to see and from others the same knowledge would be hidden ? " We understand nothing of the works of God , if we do not take as a principle that He has willed to blind some , and enlighten others , " writes Pascal about the hiddenness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one person is blind is revealed to another . What if we were to think of this not as an impairment , but as a truth that binds us into a humble participation in the community of the kingdom of God ? It is for this experience of seeing what God reveals of himself through others that we are encouraged to come into regular fellowship with a body of believers . We assemble so that the variegated threads of the glory of God can take form visibly , not in the one life , but in the many . The challenge I have experienced again and again , as I enter into community with others who share faith in Christ , is to receive gratefully the particular knowledge revealed to me , however modest and perplexing , and to offer this freely to others , while at the same time accepting from them , without judgment or envy , what they have been given . More often one showing is treasured and another is scrapped , if its presence is recognized at all . AFTER MY FRESHMAN year in college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amsterdam , in a youth hostel where I helped make beds and mop floors . I was part of a student mission program sponsored by my college . Some of us traveled around Europe taking the good news of salvation with us ; some staved in one place . Every other day I had dinner shift at the shelter , which meant , because of our efficiently limited menu , that I prepared ham and cheese omelets on toast for the hostel guests . They sat at the counter , having arrived with little money from places such as Paris , Rome or Egypt , and we talked about where we came from . Some told of their distant families , some spoke of displacement or exile . Some drifted in from Vandal Square so high on drugs they seemed to devour their food without breathing . I was there to tell them about the love of Jesus , and when they asked why I was there , I did . The staff and student volunteers at the hostel began the day with a Bible study and prayer time led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program there . I quickly grew to love her . She taught me a few Dutch phrases , laughing good-naturedly at my faltering pronunciation . She kept an eye on me when the Italian boys came around with their guitars , and one weekend she drove - with me to the coast of the North Sea for what she described as a time of intensive prayer . The way I prayed was fine , she said , but her kind of prayer went further than her head . She could simply invite the Holy Spirit to come and pray for her , and in a mellifluous utterance reserved for God alone , the words began to spill from her being . She was an extrovert , wild with praise , her arms freely lifted to the heavens . All day she would sing little choruses of joy while I tried not to mope about , struggling with my poverty and my noisy , cheerleader-of-a-mission teammate from the States , and probably with my homesickness . Truus also led a Bible study , one day a week , for the prostitutes in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . I had seen her try to cast a demon , in the name of Jesus , from a strung-out , raging hurl of a man who forced his way into the hostel at midnight demanding money and a needle . She placed her hand on him and spoke an authoritative prayer , and he fell to his knees by the front desk , temporarily sedated . I wanted to be exactly like her : spiritually complete , a worker of miracles , a picture of the woman who knows the heart of God . So when I watched the sun drape itself over the water as we walked along the deserted beach , I soaked up every word she said . We stopped when we had passed the row of striped cabanas and knelt in the cool sand , and she laid her hands on my head . Fervently , she invited the spirit of God to give me the supernatural gift of tongues , so that I might be blessed with a deeper prayer . " We are waiting on you , Lord , " she said patiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once before , a team of Truus 's friends , who manifested what I understood to be a richer set of spiritual gifts than mine , had placed their hands on my head and petitioned God on my behalf . They crowded around , all asking for the same fullness to fill me , fully believing . I must not have been ready , Truus said , though I know others must have thought of me as stubborn or unworthy . Maybe I needed to be alone , less distracted . Maybe possessed a deep root of rebellion whose tendrils needed to be wrenched from the hard flesh of my heart . This is completely possible , if not likely . On the beach Truus spoke words over me that were not in either of our languages . Her tone was pleading . She pressed her fingers tenderly along the sides of my temples . I opened my mouth , truly willing . " Dear God , " I said , " examine my heart . Please do n't let me miss the gifts you have for me by any sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Something like that , hoping the words would suddenly transform themselves into sounds like the ones I had heard released from the mouths of the Christians in Amsterdam , and not the cerebral ascent that left some willful root tangled around my heart . I said that prayer and nothing more . We waited in the music of Truus 's faithful prayers until the sun had slipped below the line where the sea curved . And then we walked back to her car . I know I disappointed her . We spent an awkward evening eating at an inexpensive Vietnamese restaurant . At home in her tiny apartment she served me a dish of flan for dessert . She had made a bed for me out of blankets on the floor and let me have her pillow . I remember her asking God to double our sleep that night so that we would wake refreshed . She must have been exhausted . I have often wondered if her prayer for me could have been answered had I somehow gotten my mind out of the way . DESCRIBING what she takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pilgrimage to the Eastern Orthodox Church of St. George in the Chicago suburb of Cicero . She wanted to witness a wooden icon of the Theotokos , the Virgin Mary , that had been weeping since the Friday evening before Holy Week , April 1994 . " The tears are oily in substance and leave a double shiny trail down the Virgin 's red robe and over the hand of her son , which is raised in blessing . Even when , as now , the episodes of weeping are less frequent , the visible trail of tears remains , " she testifies . And then , because she has come to expect no less than the visible presence of God in our worship of him , she continues , " Of course , conversions and healings have followed in its wake , as people were anointed with the tears . " I look around me at the broad and free-wheeling faith of those I admire . Comparatively , my experience of the supernatural pales , I am tempted to think . Where are my signs and wonders ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched my mother , with a sorrow deeper than any I have known , consoled by the mercy and comfort of God . In her smile God 's glory begins to show . I am concentrating on the words of the chorus we are singing at my sister 's church when the man standing beside me falls into the aisle smitten with holy laughter . He rolls around the cramped space in what strikes me as a rather hideous bliss . For me God appears in moments of quiet recognition : a word or phrase that strikes me to the core , as a still , small voice once outdid a rushing wind . " Somehow I have to trust that God is at work in me and that the way I am being moved to new inner and outer places is part of a larger movement of which I am only a very small part , " writes Henri Nouwen . To acknowledge that one is a very small part of something much larger than the self is to be able to celebrate the potential wholeness of God 's revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another 's . It is to celebrate the kingdom of God , as Jesus did , among the sick and blind and lost . It is helpful to recognize that a small part has a limited view and particular gifts , and that the whole will shape the part , just as the part will alter , perhaps enhance , the whole . In his novel Remembering Babylon the Australian writer David Malouf beautifully describes the unique contribution of the individual showing forth God , in the character of the parson whose wife of 33 years understands him better than he does himself . " Cleverness , she knows , has nothing to do with what he is after ; which is revelation . What will be revealed , he believes , is the unique gift that is in each man and woman , in each creature and plant too-what else has his study of nature shown him ? - and must also be in him : a gift he alone can give to the world , and which without him it must lack . " In the past several years I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participated in the liturgical arts groups at the church I attend . The sheer array of different skill sets and personalities visible among this small group within a local church strikes me as one of the more beautiful evidences of God 's handiwork . There , on any given project , one designs , one drafts to scale , one chooses the perfect color , several construct or sew , others paint , write , dance , administrate . At the end of one person 's abilities and service another 's begins , until the work of the church is completed . My job has been to design and then to select and assemble the cloths and braids we use for our fabric hangings . These are the jobs I most want and others seem to avoid . They marvel at the way patterns and textures blend that they might have found unsuitable together , as I marvel at the perfect construction of the frame that one of our carpenters has assembled . Each individual , if she is in the right place , enjoys her job the most , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she does best . When I have approached the quilting table , though I am welcome , I have found the experts there mildly fretting over my imperfect stitches and graciously urging me to enjoy a cup of tea to keep my hands otherwise employed while I visit with them . The result of offering , in return to God and to each other , the gifts with which he has uniquely equipped each member of the body not only pictures but lets us experience God 's kingdom .
