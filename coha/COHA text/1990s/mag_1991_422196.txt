Section : Articles Dollars in Moscow buy a lot of democrats  --  but not a lot of democracy <p> EVEN before the August coup ' finally exposed the stupidity of Western policy toward the Soviet Union , that policy was demonstrably wrong . Western policy-makers did not falter in their support for Mikhail Gorbachev  --  even though their expressions of friendship were not translated into the massive infusion of money Gorbachev had originally hoped to obtain in London this summer , or into some kind of grand bargain ' such as the one cobbled together at Harvard 's Kennedy School . Responsible heads of state , it is said , must seek stability in world affairs . They still cling to the old wisdom of all mediocrities , choosing the devil they know over the devil they do not know . <p> The great irony for these Western seekers of stability is that it was the Soviet government  --  and not the democratic opposition , which made them so nervous  --  that constituted the real threat to stability . Gorbachev was not strong enough to govern , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be removed peacefully . <p> Meanwhile , Soviet society was in danger of exploding violently , like Chernobyl , leaving behind a poisoned and poisonous landscape . The only condition that could stabilize the country , then as now , was the emergence of a strong , unified democratic movement that could oust the Communist Party peacefully , federate the nations of the empire , and see the people through the inevitable dislocation and pain of economic reform . <p> That Western politicians did not , if they ever will , understand the difficulty they were putting in the way of a decent outcome for the Soviet peoples goes without saying . But sad to say , it is not only they who have made such obstacles . Even the foundations and organizations that do in theory understand the need to support the democratic movement and that have devoted both energy and resources to the effort , in practice often do more harm than good . For one thing , though their sympathies are in the right place , in their Western lack of feel for the ins and outs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent , an opportunist , or even just a plain crook from a genuine democratic activist . Often , therefore , the kind of assistance offered by such sympathizers is simply abused  --  that is , used to fuel personal rivalries among self-serving and basically insignificant characters . <p> Indeed , because of the political climate in Russia , with various groups in competition and without consistent , policy-driven support from the West , Moscow before the coup had become the scene of a new quest for El Dorado . Each nugget of Western gold , no matter how small , was seen as a sign of fulfillment to come . And with such nuggets being scattered here and there  --  pluralistically , ' as some who scatter them like to say  --  the unification of a strong democratic movement became an ever more difficult prospect . Meanwhile , of course , the KGB was busy promoting a pluralism ' of its own , not from ignorance but from the old effective policy of divide and conquer . Russians could , to be sure , resist the KGB  --  they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feliks Dzerzhinsky was uprooted . But who among them could resist the blandishments of Western friends , their mentors and guides ? Whose Reform ? <p> IN A WAY , the best example of this problem is the National Endowment for Democracy . ( Perhaps it is that I myself feel I have the greatest stake in the NED , for many hours , days , weeks of my life have been spent on Capitol Hill , lobbying , petitioning , arguing for its budget to be increased . ) Now , in the years preceding perestroika , the NED was one of only a handful of American organizations to support Russian democrats . But as was the case with Western statesmen , including even Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher , the NED was thrown into a certain confusion by perestroika . In Mikhail Gorbachev 's Soviet Union there were government reformers ' on the one hand , and a popular revolt on the other . How was one to choose ? The situation called above all for a clear understanding of what was going on and an unwavering policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , the NED floundered , at best doing little and at worst doing damage . <p> Take the problem of grants for publishing . Several years ago , the distinction between the official and the unofficial press was clear : the former was Communist controlled and government funded , while the latter could usually be counted on to be democratically oriented and , of course , to have virtually no resources of its own . To some extent then , singling out any of the various underground papers or magazines for support could be justified . Today , however , most periodicals in the Soviet Union have to compete in the market in order to survive . Even what would seem from the NED 's perspective to be a small grant to some publication  --  and it is difficult for Americans to grasp what even a modest number of dollars , and especially the American connection , ' can mean in the way of relative advantage  --  creates only envy and bitter rivalry . More than that , when the NED , as it does , singles out this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it corrupts both the market and the independence of the press : as the prices of paper and printing get artificially pumped up , the unofficial publications find themselves competing for foreign grants , rather than for Soviet readers , in order to survive . <p> There has been a similar distortion in the publication of books . In 1990 and 1991 the NED gave a Russian publisher grants to produce a series of books by American Sovietologists . What such grants have actually done is help to stifle competition in the book market . To cite just the one case I am best acquainted with , at the end of last year my book , To Build a Castle , was published in an initial printing of two hundred thousand . Such is the hunger of the reading public that the book was sold out in a couple of weeks and the publishing house , Democratic Russia , made a healthy profit . But , the publisher told me , six months later a printing of that size would not even cover expenses . Printers in the Soviet Union today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be generated by selling books to Soviet readers . One way to describe NED support for Soviet book publishing , therefore , is to say that the United States Congress is spending taxpayer 's money to promote books in Russia that most Western readers never bothered to buy , and in so doing , to help kill off any fair competition in the emerging Soviet book market . <p> But this is a minor annoyance compared to the political corruption being bred by the dollars of the promoters of democracy . ' For instance , the congressional code of ethics would surely forbid members of Congress from accepting foreign subsidies for political activities . Apparently , what is unacceptable for an American is commendable for a Russian . Western funds have been routinely provided to various members of the Supreme Soviet as well as to other elected officials in order to encourage ' democratic activity . Last year the NED gave $15,000 to the Social Judicial Commission of the Russian Federation for it to work out legal safeguards for civil organizations ' and another $15,000 to the Constitutional Commission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new constitution . Again , it is hard for Americans to imagine how much money $15,000 is in present-day Moscow . It is something like half a million rubles , enough to feed one hundred Russian families for a whole year . What does a constitutional commission need ? Pens and paper  --  and perhaps a few pounds of coffee to keep it awake . How many French francs did the Founding Fathers need to write the American Constitution ? How will the unemployed , but not unemployable , former KGB agents manage to refrain from creating corruption scandals when the opportunity arises to discredit the democratic forces in the eyes of hungry people ? <p> Naturally , the NED is not the only institution involved here . Private foundations and activist groups , large and small , Left and Right , are equally guilty of contributing to this mess . They believe they are promoting democracy by helping their own ' respective Russians , and no doubt also honestly believe that what they are furthering is a healthy competition in the marketplace of ideas . In reality what they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds . Democrat du Jour <p> IRONICALLY , the bigger the donor , the likelier that it will end up making serious mischief . If in the judgment of the NED an obscure emigre magazine or 15 American Sovietologists are the best champions of democracy , pseudo-democrats like Eduard Shevardnadze are bound to attract the sympathy ( along with vastly larger stipends ) of the bigger foundations , especially now that he heads something so profitably named as the Democratic Reform Movement . ' Shevardnadze is best known to the Russian people  --  if not , obviously , to wide-eyed Westerners like Secretary of State James Baker  --  as the bloody executioner of his own fellow Georgians in the mid Seventies . They can not be inspired by him , nor will they ever trust him . Never mind . The West , should it now be losing faith in that other great democrat , Mikhail Gorbachev , can now offer them a different chosen beneficiary , Eduard Shevardnadze . For a while , that is . <p> Meanwhile , freedom and democracy will prevail among the peoples of the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to deal with the devil any longer . Maybe the West will belatedly share their longing and learn how to act on it wisely . <p> Cartoon : GORRELL <p> By VLADIMIR BUKOVSKY <p> <p> Mr. Bukovsky , exiled in 1976 after a long stint in Gulag for dissident activities , is the author of , among other works , To Build a Castle . <p>
