<p> ' HAW over a little , Poochki . Haw over . Good girl ! " <p> Leaving a cluster of spectators and a whole lot of barking behind , a musher directs his team of 12 huskies on a 9.8-mile race . At the first quarter mile , only three sounds can be heard : panting , then paws hitting snow , then sled runners . <p> Here at the sixth annual Winter Carnival , the day is sunny and 10 degrees below zero F. " It 's so cold here in Maine , we had to shovel the smoke off the top of the chimney , " quips Race Marshall Roger Ek . <p> Not much keeps mushers away from the meet , one of three held in New England on a recent Saturday . Of the 309 sled-dog organizations in the world , 101 are in the United States , says Donna Hawley , director of the International Sled Dog Racing Association Inc. in Nordman , Idaho . Last year , some 6,600 people competed in more than 316 competitions in the US . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " sled-dog racing is receiving greater recognition as a sport , says Ms. Hawley . It 's about time , say many mushers , for the sport is one of the oldest in the world . <p> Before , " we would never see our results on a sports page , " Hawley says . But now involvement is more international . Events have more television coverage , more spectators , more sponsors ( such as dog-food companies ) , and more competitors . At the recent World Championships in Winnipeg , ten countries were represented . The Iditarod , the famous 1,158-mile race from Anchorage to Nome , Alaska ( starting March 2 ) , has its first entry from the Soviet Union this year . " It 's a long process , and we 're working toward that goal of becoming an Olympic sport , " says Hawley . <p> Here in Lincoln , the Olympics are far from drivers ' minds . Their focus is on sustaining a speedy canine pitter-patter and following the course . With 42 entrants , this meet is small compared with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " big league " competitions , you do n't hear talk of drug testing or see much buying , selling , or trading of dogs . <p> The action centers around sportsmanship and community spirit . When a dog team tied to a car bumper breaks loose , sending a dozen dogs into a friendly tangle , everyone lends a hand . Snowmobilers offer to help patrol the trail . Spectator Brian Strout says his family comes " to watch the teamwork between the owners and animals . " Many of the competitors know each other from previous races . There 's even a " Mushers ' Ball " in town tonight . <p> " It 's like a No. 1 hobby , " says musher Jeff Johnson from the Narragansett Bay ( R.I. ) Sled-Dog Club . Some drivers have seasonal jobs - such as commercial fisherman - that allow them to devote the winter to the sport . A few racers do it for a living . ( Full-time racers often breed and sell dogs , and may be sponsored by dog-food companies . ) <p> What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling out on the trail , the camaraderie , a love of the outdoors , the family-style fun , and love of animals are common responses . Sled-dog racing is also one of the few sports where men and women compete on an equal basis and age is not a barrier . <p> " It 's the only sport I do , " says Raymond ( Frenchy ) LaBrie , a truck driver from Auburn , Maine , who owns 22 Alaskan Huskies and one big timber wolf . <p> " You could n't wish for anything better than this , " says James Ducette , from Prince Edward Island , Canada , who 's here with his daughter Laurie and son Marc , also competitors . " Love and attention " are a big part of keeping his family 's 19 dogs happy and obedient , he says . <p> Events here are determined by the class of competition ( " pro " or " sportsman " ) , the number of dogs ( four , six , or " unlimited " ) , and the number of miles ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.8 for unlimited ) . There 's even a one-dog race for children , and a $3,000 purse . <p> Sled dogs are athletes . They undergo serious physical training for speed and endurance . Most are Siberian or Alaskan huskies , though other dogs run . Sled dogs sell for between $300 and $6,000 . <p> " They all have their own personality , " says Laurie Ducette , 17 , who placed second in today 's four-dog pro event with a time of 14 minutes , 16.13 seconds . Lead dogs , especially , must develop a run-or-bust attitude and a close relationship with their driver . The two lead dogs must be three things , says Mr. Ek : fast , brave , and smart . " I had a female , " he says , recalling one of his two lead dogs . " She was fast and smart , but just a little bit timid . Then I had a male . Now he was fast and brave , but dumber than a box o ' rocks . " Smart and brave made a winning team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , " he says . <p> Drivers shout commands to the lead dogs : " Ghee ! " ( right ) and " Haw ! " ( left ) . " Knowing left from right is an enormous concept for a dog , " Ek says . Contrary to popular belief , drivers do not yell " Mush ! " They shout " Hike ! " to get teams going . " They call themselves ' mushers , ' but they never use the word ' mush . ' That 's something out of Jack London , " he adds . " Mush " is thought to be a corruption of the French word marche - to walk , move forward . During the race , the team responds to such commands as " Pick it up ! " <p> Top dogs can sustain a speed of 22 to 23 m.p.h. for short periods . Johnson says his team starts at around 20 m.p.h. , but after 15 minutes they drop to around 15 m.p.h . " But you strive to get better , " he says . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Ek . Mushers " pump " or " pedal " the sled along with one leg ( much the way one rides a scooter ) to increase speed . <p> The wooden sled weighs about 40 pounds and averages eight feet long . Runners are usually coated with polyethylene . There 's a brake and a " snow hook " for stopping , though most drivers depend on " whoa ! " The sled holds extra gloves , hats , and equipment . There 's also room for a dog who might become injured or exhausted . During training , when there is no snow , drivers use wheeled rigs . <p> The dogs are well-treated , say drivers . " If you do n't take care of them - treat them right - they do n't perform for you , " says Johnson , gearing up for the six-dog race with Toast and Nellie ( his " lead dogs " ) , Sparky and Tippy ( " point dogs " ) , and Ranger and Joey ( " wheel dogs " ) . <p> " I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 56-year-old 1989 Maine State Champion who says her huskies are " wicked fast . " She adds : " It 's an accomplishment to think that you 're working with dogs and that they work for you . "
