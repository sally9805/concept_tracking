A still-life painter preserves the bounty of the garden in her work . BY MARIE P ROE LL ER // PAINTER MIMI ROBERTS LEARNED TO appreciate good food at an early age . As young girl growing up in England , Mimi haunted her mother 's kitchen , a culinary paradise of simmering pots , intoxicating aromaseven pheasants in the fridge . But it was n't until Mimi went off to college that she ever considered combining her fascination with fine food with her passion for fine art . As an art student , Mimi was made aware of the work of European still-life painters from the 16th and 17th centuries . She was especially intrigued by artists who created dramatic renderings of the trappings of privilege and social position for their status-conscious clients . Exotic foods-oysters , artichokes , pomegranates , and almonds-figured prominently in the works of artists from the Netherlands to Spain . Their paintings , rich in color and wonderfully detailed , captured the young artist 's imagination . Today Mimi follows the tradition of the classic still-life artists , with one caveat : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humble vegetables , like parsnips , potatoes , or leeks , can result in the most beautiful paintings , " she explains . Artist at Work Mimi 's themesa particular vegetable or fruit or the ingredients of a favorite recipeseldom vary , but her models are seasonal . " It depends on what 's in the garden or the market at the time , " she reveals . " If it 's brussels sprout season , I 'll paint brussels sprouts . " Fortunately , the garden 's calendar provides an ever-changing lineup of produce from which Mimi may choose her subjects . " I 've just done a great run of cabbages , " she told us when we spoke with her this past spring , at the tail end of England 's cabbage season . " Asparagus season is coming up ; I 'm looking forward to the change . " Once she 's chosen her object , Mimi cuts a wood panel to the appropriate size . " If it 's a single cucumber , I will cut the wood into a small , horizontal rectangle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd use a larger panel . " Then she proceeds to capture her subject in oil , taking special care to depict the smallest detail in the fold of a cabbage leaf or the glint of sunlight on a lemon rind . " I enjoy vegetables as objects-their colors , shapes , and textures , " she says . Photograph " My subject matter is seasonal , " says still-life artist Mimi Roberts ( shown here in her kitchen ) . If cabbages or brussels sprouts are in season , she explains , that 's the time of year she 'll create works like A Cabbage on a Plate ( top right ) and A Basket of Sprouts ( bottom right ) . Clients often commission Mimi to immortalize the ingredients of their favorite recipes ; the fresh garlic , eggs , olive oil , and lemon needed for aioli appear in the picture above .

Personal Preferences A good number of Mimi 's commissions come from fellow food lovers . " If a woman 's husband is particularly keen on peas , for instance , I might be asked to do a special work for a birthday or anniversary , " Mimi says . " Or perhaps you 've grown a marvelous specimen in your garden and you want to do more than just take a photograph of it . You might want a portrait of it . " One couple loved Indian curries so much that they asked Mimi to depict all the ingredients required for their favorite dish . Another work she recently completed-a wholesome selection of fruits , vegetables , fish , and grains-hangs in the offices of a cancer-research group .
