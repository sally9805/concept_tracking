What 's with this market ? Defying a stock implosion in Tokyo and creeping interest rates at home , it seems to reach effortlessly skyward . But a closer look reveals some straining . While the Dow has climbed a respectable 5% so far this year , the broader indexes are all down a shade . Compared with earnings and cash flows , prices look high . Investment bankers are flooding the pipelines with initial public offerings , and individual investors are rushing into mutual funds , both signs of a market top . Are we teetering toward a stock market wipeout ? Probably not , but do n't be surprised if stocks only saw-tooth their way through spring and summer . The gap between stock prices and stock values looks too wide for the market to climb significantly . Corporate earnings , abysmal last year , must grow to shrink stretched price/earnings multipies , or long-term interest rates , which recently topped 8% for 30-year Treasury bonds , must drop again before stocks can sustain solid growth . It looks as though the standout stock market performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more normal level ( see table ) . ( Table omitted ) Do you want to invest in a market like this ? Probably not heavily . But if you 're already in stocks and want to adjust your portfolio , listen to the big debate on Wall Street over the merits of value stocks , usually cheaper industrial corporations , vs. less cyclical growth companies . Lately the smokestackers seem to be winning . One reason the Dow is ahead of other indexes is that it is more heavily industrial , with such stocks as International Paper , up 8% , and Alcoa , up 16% . Says Goldman Sachs investment strategist Steven Einhorn : " These cyclical companies will have the biggest earnings gains over the next several quarters , so it stands to reason they will continue to do well . " Many market strategists suggest that last quarter was a turning point for smokestack stocks . Growth stocks and industrial stocks tend to exchange the lead in performance every few years ( see chart ) , and after several years of growth stocks ' performing better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do better when the economy picks up . ( Chart omitted ) Goldman 's Einhorn wisely suggests a blended approach , mixing a helping of healthy , attractively priced industrial stocks with a saable dollop of growth stocks . " We are certainly recommending a more eclectic portfolio than we have in the past several years , " he says . Einhorn recently added a few commodiry chemical makers , such as DuPont and Arco Chemical , to his buy list , as well as paper and forest product companies International Paper , Stone Container , and Georgia-Pacific . Of these companies he says , " Cost restructuring has generated surprisingly good earnings on very limited sales volume . " Geoffrey Raymond , chief investment officer of Timco , the $4.5 billion money management arm of Travelers , is one of many managers trying to balance growth and value stocks . " Right now the marble is in the middle of the plate , but it is rolling toward the cyclical stocks , " he says . One he likes is Williams Cos. , a gas pipeline company with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 1993 earnings estimate . Earnings are growing 25% annually . And what about that dollop of growth stocks ? Plenty are available ( see Portfolio Talk ) . Michael DiCarlo , who runs the John Hancock Special Equities Fund and comanages the firm 's global fund , likes a couple of small leisure stocks . SLM International makes toys and CCM hockey gear . It sells for $20 , and DiCarlo thinks it will earn $1.20 a share this year . He also recommends Charter Golf maker of Ashworth golf shirts . Masters champion Fred Couples is the product spokesman , and the shirts , sold only in pro shops , are jumping off the shelves . The stock goes for $8 , or 23 times DiCarlo 's per share earnings estimate for this year . Raymond of Timco has been looking for growth in technology stocks , including software colossus Microsoft , which fell recently on a weaker than expected growth forecast and trades near $120 a share . Raymond figures earnings should increase about 28% per year and says , " I think the stock will sell for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the banking sector Raymond favors Synovus Financial , which owns banks in Sunbelt states . Its prize possession is Total System Services , a bank card data processor that handles AT &T's; Universal Card . That business is booming . BONDS . What to do . Yields on CDs and Treasury bills are so miserly that you have to wonder if they 're worth the bother , but if you want safety , where else can you look ? In a few places , as it turns out , that offer savvy savers decent yields with security . Start at the Treasury market  --  but instead of buying a bill , note , or bond , investigate Treasury Strips ( a tortured acronym meaning separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities ) . Essentially zero-coupon bonds , Strips are more volatile than their interest-paying counterparts , but their yields to maturity are higher . For individuals who buy and hold bonds until they expire , that extra yield is a gift . The cheapest Strips now , says Peter Hegel , who oversees $15 billion in fixed-income funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 17 years . A ten-year Strip currently yields 8% to maturity , vs. 7.60% for a straight bond . In reality the difference may be larger because the straight bond 's yield figure assumes that interest can be reinvested in the same bonds , which sell in $1,000 increments . Most individuals wo n't get interest payments large enough to allow that . Reinvest in a money fund yielding 4% , and the straight bond 's yield to maturity falls to 6.61% . For a three-way tax break  --  federal , state and local  --  head for municipal bonds . Insured bonds , a smart way to bypass state and local budget difficulties , pay less than uninsured issues , but competition among insurers has reduced the yield giveup for these triple-A bonds to only about 0.15 percentage point . A Hegel recommendation : the noncallable Modesto , California , Irrigation District bonds , paying 6.5% and due 2011 , currently trading at par . Another triple-A , triple tax-exempt alternative favored by David Baldt , head of fixed-income investments at Morgan Grenfell , is short-to intermediate-term munis backed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee principal and interest , says Baldt , " these bonds are Treasury notes in sheep 's clothing . " Consider the Ginnie Mae-backed Allegheny County , Pennsylvania , Residential Finance Authority 6.5% bonds . REAL ESTATE . Like the nerdy kid from high school who roars back to the class reunion in a Feirari , long-neglected real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) are getting the last laugh . It 's not hard to see why . While private developers loaded up on speculative properties in the Eighties , conservative REITs , disciplined by the demands of the public market , used leverage judiciously and bought properties that actually made economic sense . When the giants crumbled , taking banks , insurance companies , and other financiers down with them , boring old REITs were the only ones left to sift through the rubble . And what a wonderful wasteland it is . Says Martin Cohen of the investment advisory firm Cohen &; Steers in New York City : " It 's a buyer 's market of unprecedented proportion . " Bruce Garrison of Kidder Peabody believes apartment buildings have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and owners are demolishing some older buildings , while the uptick in the economy will increase demand , Garrison says . He especially likes Property TIust of America , which buys buildings in the Southwest and whose apartments boast 98% occupancy . The shares yield 7% . Garrison expects shareholders who hold the stock for three years to earn 13% annually in dividends and appreciation . Health care REITs , which returned a remarkable 63% to shareholders last year , will continue to perform admirably , says Mike Kirby of Green Street Advisors , though the numbers will come down to earth . He likes Nationwide Health Proper . ties and Health Care Property Investors . Expect a total return of close to 15% annually for the next few years , he says . Michael Oliver , president of PRA Securities Advisors , thinks muscular REITs that buy community shopping centers will also excel . As frugality becomes chic , centers with " category killers "  --  successful specialty retailers such as Circuit City Stores  --  will continue to benefit at the expense of **26;140;TOOLONG regional malls .

Experts like Martin Murenbeeld say gold 's decline to a recent six-year low of $338 an ounce does n't signal a bottom . Murenbeeld , an economist at the Victoria , British Columbia , consulting firm that bears his name , notes that gold has a history of poor performance early in recoveries . Says he : " We think gold will average $343 this year , although in a worst case it could fall below $300 . " Industrial demand for several metals is in a slump . James Kneafsey , president of the institutional investment firm Cambridge Financial Management , believes many metal prices , already low , could fall another 10% to 15% this year . That forecast includes silver and platinum . Silver , which peaked in January at $4.41 an ounce , is bobbing around $4 in the face of oversupply . Platinum , a key component of catalytic converters , sold recently at $344 an ounce . Soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kept prices weak . The best way for a commodities investor to play the economic recovery is to buy stocks of efficient metals and mining companies . The key is to choose companies that are technologically proficient , with low production costs and plenty of reserves . Analyst John Tumazos of Donaldson Lufkin &; Jenrette thinks American Barrick Resources and Newmont Mining fit the bill . By preselling its gold production , American Barrick has locked in a sweet price of $425 per ounce for the next three years . At $23 a share the stock is trading at 19 times Tumazos 's 1992 earnings forecast . Newmont Mining is a large , low-cost producer that can make money when some others ca n't . Its stock , recently $37 a share , trades at 25 times estimated 1992 earnings . At County NatWest , analyst Ron Short favors multifaceted Freeport-McMoRan and Inco , a leading nickel producer . Short thinks both companies can increase earnings per share to $1.75 in 1993 . Freeport recently sold for $41 a share . Inco is more volatile , but Shorr considers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew Serwer ( stocks ) , Susan Kuhn ( bonds and commodities ) , and Shelley Neumeier ( real estate ) . <p>
