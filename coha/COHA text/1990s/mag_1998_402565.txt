IBM lets us-and you-inside its secret labs and shows off the future . // IBM . During much of the 20th century these letters have meant trendsetting industrial design-as well as tight security . Once filling large rooms with busi- ness computers , and later innovating the desktop PC , this company now takes the wraps off its vision for the future , where computers may all but disappear from view . For the first time in any publication , IBM reveals its proof-of-concept models , far-out designs , and the first practical wearable computer any of which could become your next PC . Ever since it changed its name to International Business Machines in 1924 , this corporate giant has linked its reputation to crisp , modern design , hiring top consultants like Charles Eames , creator of the classic Eames office chair , and carefully tending the details of its every product , down to the distinctive logo color that prompted its nickname-Big Blue . At the same time , IBM became notorious for secrecy on par with the CIA , KGB , and other 3-letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part because of the legacy of a 1970s federal antitrust suit , confidentiality was paramount at IBM , where plans and designs for upcoming products were seldom divulged to outsiders other than select customers and business partners . And-did we mention ? - almost never to the press . Three of the company 's design experts recently spent an afternoon briefing POPULAR MECHANICS editors on IBM 's computers of tomorrow . Corporate design director Lee Green , strategic design manager Robert Steinbugler , and new technology engineer John Karidis are among those responsible not only for the next round of IBM computer products , but for finding new applications for the latest technologies developed by the IBM Research division ( no small task since the firm has been granted more U.S. patents than any other company , five years straight ) . Arrayed in a meeting room at IBM 's offices in Somers , in suburban New York , is a collection of recent products , next-generation concept computers , form-factor engineering models , and soon-to-beproductized working prototypes . Most are not intended for public viewing , only for internal evaluation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition to projects of the Somers-based Corporate Identity &; Design department , we are being shown the work of design laboratories maintained by Big Blue for : its personal computers , in Research Triangle Park , N.C. ; servers , in Rochester , Minn. , Austin , Texas , and Poughkeepsie , N.Y. ; printers , in Boulder , Colo. ; storage devices , in San Jose , Calif. , and Tucson , Ariz. ; monitors , in Greenock , Scotland ; and mobile devices , in Yamato , Japan . Also displayed are drawings and models created by design students in Italy and Germany . Here , as elsewhere in the company , IBM staffers are quite serious about the " international " in International Business Machines . Photograph Essential computer-wear .

Y. // So why this unique peek behind the worldwide Silicon Curtain ? These days IBM is trying to re-establish its reputation in design after a period earlier in the decade when product development throughout the company was poorly coordinated . " Design was often cosmetic in nature , " says Lee Green , a L member of the management team , who was promoted five years ago by the new CEO , Louis Gerstner , to shake up Big Blue . Photograph Schmoo 's who of desktops . Richard Sapper 's fl 1996 concept forsleek PCs of tomorrow was nicknamed at IBM after the blob-like comic strip character . Photograph Picking a winner : Subnotebook // In the first act of its dramatic turnaround , IBM 's Personal Systems division set out to redesign forthcoming products for offices and homes , an initiative that became known as PC Next . " When you think about design , you may think of just the covers and exteriors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Green . An engineering evaluation of IBM PC innards found the upgrade and repair of business desktop computers could be greatly simplified with an easy-to-remove cover and swing-out media bays . Unprecedented observation of users in their business and home environments produced new design imperatives , including minimizing a PC 's presence on the desktop . For one office model , designers visually split the computer chassis into a ribbed motif for sections of the box connoting technology and softer , inviting contours for those surfaces with which a user interacts . In its flagship Aptiva home PC , developed under the code name Stealth , IBM introduced a new design configuration called a " split-system " computer , with most of its electronics stashed out of the way in a minitower on the floor while floppy discs and CD-ROMs fit in a compact media console under the monitor on the desktop . The case for " less is more " in PCs got carried further when IBM 's long-time design guru , Milan , Italy-based Richard Sapper , was asked to envision the desktop computer several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created an elegant black concept design for a laptop computer , inspiring IBM 's most in-demand personal computer line ever , ThinkPad . In his PC system of tomorrow , Sapper 's first wish was for a flat-panel display to take up a picture frame 's worth of desktop space instead of a monitor 's TV-full . When he created his sleek , blacklacquered model in 1996 , flat-panel displays for desktops were prohibitively expensive . In 1998 , the new high-end Aptiva replacing the split-system computer is the first IBM home desktop model with a flat-panel display as standard equipment . Incidentally , Sapper 's glistening un-IBM-ish blob of a minitower ( he also designed the first PC minitower ) earned it the nickname " Schmoo , " after the bowling-pin-shaped critters in Al Capp 's classic " Li'l Abner " comic strip . As in the auto industry , concept models in the computer business help designers stretch their imaginations and their companies ' ' . But unlike concept cars , concept computers do n't get shown widely . Bringing one to a computer trade exhibit would only tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IBM concept computers remain behind Big Blue 's walls , where they are expected to spur real-world products . Among the Schmoo 's design offspring is a svelte black version of IBM 's Network Computer . With flat-panel display and crisp keyboard styling , it looks more like a Bang &; Olufsen stereo than an information appliance . Only 25 working prototypes have been produced to date , but initial reaction is so positive a production model might be offered in the future . Model makers are kept busy in IBM 's design labs as the computer giant endlessly explores new product possibilities . Some fully rendered metal and plastic models look realistic enough to be powered up , like one of a subnotebook code-named Monarch Butterfly because of its expanding keyboard-a possible successor to the popular ThinkPad of a few years ago , code-named Butterfly . Other in-house explorations never go beyond a foam-model stage , including the nifty design study for a TV set-top Internet computer Big Blue decided not to build : The spacey chassis would certainly have given WebTV a run for its money . A number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that IBM is a computer company and not a consumer electronics firm . Designers here talk about " pervasive computing , " the everyday environment of the future in which computers are everywhere , yet PCs are hardly seen . " There 's a limited number of people who have a need to use computers as we know them , " says Robert Steinbugler , who designed the Aptiva splitsystem PC . " In order to evolve and grow the industry , we have to find new places for our technology . We 're looking at when the technology evolves to smaller and smaller places-where does IBM play ? " To keep their thinking fresh , Steinbugler and his colleagues seek input not just from IBM 's far-flung design labs , but also beyond Big Blue , sponsoring student design competitions in the United States and abroad . In one exercise , IBM 's Yamato , Japan , designers and students in Stuttgart , Germany , were asked to envision the electronic newspaper of the future . Finalists ' drawings were turned into polished concept models that in some form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now . A student design project at the Polytechnic University in Milan resulted in striking models for Web viewers aimed at high-schoolers and children in grades four through eight . Though these specific designs probably will never be put into production , they have prompted greater attention within IBM to the whole category of Web viewers . At the moment , the design concepts most likely to succeed are those incorporating new technologies from IBM Research . The recent announcement of IBM flat-panel display technology with greater image resolution than the pages in this magazine explains several proof-of-concept models and drawings , some aimed at possible business partners to market the actual products . The most intriguing of these mockups posits a wireless Net PC melded into a handheld cellphone : A business card-sized display would offer fullsize Web pages pulled out of the sky . The biggest buzz right now surrounds what could become IBM 's first breakthrough product in years , its comfortable , lightweight Wearable PC . Already being called the Walkman of personal computing , a working model is fresh from the IBM technology open house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The handheld central-processor unit , designed in Yamato , packs the full functionality of a ThinkPad 560 laptop into a translucent package that should steal some of the iMac 's thunder . This 10.5-ounce ( including battery ) system , which runs at a respectable 233 MHz , would not be possible without IBM 's new 1in. - dia. microdrive hard disc technology . It also showcases the first truly unobtrusive eyepiece arrangement , a transparent boom with a magnified display on a chip , developed at nearby T.J. Watson Research Center , N.Y .
