VOTER FURY LAST NOV. 8  --  PERHAPS INCLUDING YOUR BALLOT  --  HAS virtually guaranteed that one way or another Americans will see their federal tax load lighten in 1995 . The new Republican leadership in the House of Representatives promises to bring 17 tax-cut proposals from its famed Contract with America to a vote by April 13 . Of course , all of those tax breaks wo n't pass  --  not even most of them . If they did , the $203.4 billion federal budget deficit could balloon by an estimated $150 billion by fiscal year 2000 . Our forecast : a tax credit of $300 or so for families with incomes up to $50,000 , more generous IRAs and a capital-gains tax cut . Undoubtedly , though , the message appears to be getting through to Washington : Our Taxes Are Too High . Do Something ! And We Mean Now ! The evidence that tax levels are revolting appears in a newly released report from the Tax Foundation , a nonpartisan research group in Washington , D.C. According to the study , the median household ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross income of $53,354 ) now pays 39.5% of its gross in federal , state and local taxes . What 's more , similar households in the top 39.6% federal bracket are handing over as much as 50% of their take to the tax men . That means , at these rates , a couple would have to pay as much as $4.2 million in taxes during their productive years . Can the Republicans ( and their Democratic allies ) roll back taxes enough to please the voters ? The test will come early this year . " For now , you have to give the Republicans the benefit of the doubt that they 'll fight tooth and nail for the tax cuts , " says Stan Collender , a Washington , D.C. federal budget expert at the accounting firm Price Waterhouse . The challenge will be in financing the largesse . So look for genuine spending-cut pain to emerge in lockstep with any tax-cut gain . Come what may , there 's no reason to wait for the politicians to get their tax act together  --  particularly when the deadline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive three-part tax package will show you how to beat the bite now .

Begin with the tips below . You 'll find the ones that apply directly to you in the section that covers your federal tax bracket : HELP FOR PEOPLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR COUPLES FILING JOINTLY , $22,750 FOR SINGLES ; ' 95 : $39,000 AND $23,350 Chances are you 're young if you fall into this bracket  --  or have a child with income . The advice in this section will help you develop valuable tax-saving habits early or help make your kids ' fortunes grow faster . * If you make no other tax move , open an IRA . An Individual Retirement Account offers tremendous advantages to pre-pre-retirees in their twenties . You get to deduct a full $2,000 contribution to an IRA as long as your adjusted gross income is $25,000 or less if you 're single , $40,000 or less if you are married and file jointly . ( AGI is your total income minus a few tax-favored items , such as alimony you pay . Taxable income , the amount on which your tax rate is based , is your AGI minus your deductions and exemptions . ) If your spouse works , you can each contribute $2,000 to your respective IRAs , for an annual tax savings of $600 . To make saving easier , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you have your IRA to deduct the contribution from your checking or savings account each month . By the way , you have until April 17 to open and write off a ' 94 IRA . April 15 falls on a Saturday , so tax-filing day is delayed . Washington watch advisory : Odds are strong that Congress will pass a so-called back-end IRA this year . This would permit nondeductible annual contributions of up to $4,000 per couple ( $2,000 for singles ) . Like a traditional IRA , the earnings would grow tax deferred . Then after five years you could make withdrawals tax-free if you used the money for retirement , a first-home purchase , college or large medical expenses . The Republican proposal would even let you convert all or part of your current IRA to a back-end account , not including rollovers from employer-sponsored plans . To do so , you would have to pay income tax on the previously untaxed portion of the IRA , although you could spread the tax over four years . For now you 're better off with a deductible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you need the money . * Duck the kiddie tax on your low-bracket children . By transferring cash or income-producing assets to a no-fee custodial account in your child 's name at a bank , brokerage or mutual fund , earnings generally will be taxed at your child 's lower tax rate , typically 15% . But if he or she is under 14 , your child must pay taxes at your top tax rate on investment income above $1,200 in 1994 , $1,300 in 1995  --  that would be the amount accumulated on about $16,250 earning 8% in 1995 . To avoid this fate , look for investments that pay out little or no income until after the child turns 14 . Worthy choices include Series EE U.S. savings bonds ( now yielding 5.92% ) and zero-coupon Treasury bonds ( 7.6% to 8.1% ) . Washington watch advisory : The new GATT trade agreement will eliminate the guaranteed 4% rate for EE bonds you hold for less than five years ( see Your Money Monitor on page 42 ) . * Start your kid on an IRA . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from , say , a summer job , to an IRA , this move can be a clever way to keep your child 's earnings from being taxed while getting him or her a super-early start on retirement savings . Washington watch advisory : If the back-end IRA becomes law , it could become a favored vehicle for funding a child 's college education since you could make tax-free withdrawals for college after five years . For now , however , have your child use a deductible IRA . If the back-end version passes , you will probably be allowed to convert to one . FOR PEOPLE IN THE 28% BRACKET 1994 TAXABLE INCOME OF $38,001 TO $91,850 FOR COUPLES FILING JOINTLY , $22,751 TO $55,100 FOR SINGLES ; FOR ' 95 , IT 'S $39,001 TO $94,250 AND $23,351 TO $56,550 This bracket is typically populated by young families and retirees who need to take investment steps to keep the IRS away from their earnings or their Social Security checks . * Sell winning stocks and stock funds as soon as you wish , without tax worries . Lucky you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't have the problem folks in the 31% , 36% or 39.6% brackets face : risking a price decline by trying to hold on to a stock or equity fund for more than one year so it will qualify as a long-term capital gain , thus taxable at a top rate of 28% . So you can feel free to take your profits whenever the time seems right . Washington watch advisory : If the long-term capital-gains rate is cut to half your top income tax rate , as new House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer ( R-Texas ) proposes , the advice above becomes inoperable  --  to cite a famous Republican term . That 's because if you sold a profitable stock or stock fund that you 've owned for a year or less , you would owe taxes at your 28% income tax rate instead of the proposed 14% capital-gains rate . Still , if you own a stock or fund that you think has peaked , go ahead and sell it in 1995 . Not only is that a prudent investment move , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new lower capital-gains rates would be available for any capital asset held for more than a year and sold in ' 95 , regardless of when the law is passed . * File down your FICA tax . If you contribute to a flexible spending account at work , you may be able to cut not only your income tax but your Social Security ( FICA ) tax as well . An FSA lets you set aside up to $5,000 in pretax salary to pay for dependent-care expenses , plus another amount determined by your employer  --  generally $2,000 to $4,000  --  to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses . Assume you make less than $61,200  --  the highest income subject to the 7.65% FICA tax in ' 95  --  and you 're in the 28% bracket . If you contribute $4,000 to your FSA , you 'll shave $1,120 off your federal income tax and $306 off your FICA. * Minimize the bite on your Social Security check . Retirees in the 28% bracket are in the Social Security danger zone . As soon as your provisional income ( adjusted gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security benefit ) inches past $32,000 on a joint return ( $25,000 for a single ) , half your benefits are subject to federal tax . As your provisional income tops $44,000 on a joint return ( $34,000 for a single ) , the danger becomes intense  --  up to 85% of your benefits are taxed . You can trim your provisional income by favoring such investments as EE savings bonds ( you do n't have to declare the annual interest until you redeem the bonds ) ; rental real estate ( its losses reduce your AGI ) and growth stocks ( their dividends are minimal and capital gains are n't taxed until you sell ) . Washington watch advisory : Gradual relief may be on the way . Republicans propose phasing out the ' 93 law that taxed up to 85% of Social Security benefits ; no more than 50% would be taxable by the year 2000 . They 'd also raise the amount people ages 65 to 69 can earn without losing benefits from $11,280 in 1995 to $30,000 by 2000 . FOR THE 31% AND 36% BRACKETS ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOINTLY , $55,101 TO $250,000 FOR SINGLES ; FOR ' 95 , IT 'S $94,251 TO $256,500 AND $56,551 TO $256,500 These brackets are the ones serious investors tend to find themselves in . Fortunately , there are ways to shave taxes : * Take a deep breath , and buy top-quality municipal bonds and diversified muni bond funds . We know , we know . This past year was ungodly for many muni investors who saw their bonds and funds lose as much as 11% of their value . The year ahead looks better , though . Although MONEY believes long-term rates will rise by as much as half a percentage point by mid- ' 95 , we think rates will level off after that . Even today , on an after-tax basis , the 6% to 6.5% tax-free yields of intermediate-term munis exceed those of taxable bonds for investors in the 31% bracket and up . If you do n't have the $25,000 to $50,000 to buy a portfolio of individual munis , invest through diversified national muni funds . Don Phillips , publisher of Morningstar , a fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( recent yield : 5.6% ; 800-382-8722 ) and Vanguard Muni Intermediate ( yield : 5.4% ; 800-851-4999 ) . ( For the effect of the Orange County bankruptcy on muni investors , see page 78. ) * Look into rental real estate . Landlords who actively manage their properties may deduct up to $25,000 a year in net rental losses against ordinary income such as wages , interest and dividends . You 're considered active if you own at least 10% of a property and make management decisions like approving new tenants or authorizing repairs . The $25,000 maximum allowable write-off starts to phase out when your AGI tops $100,000 and disappears entirely at $150,000. * Consider taking more shelter . Since first and second homes still provide the best tax shelter around , ponder buying a vacation home . As long as you borrow only up to $1 million , you can fully deduct the interest on debt incurred to buy , build or improve a first and second home combined . And there 's no limit on property tax write-offs . Points paid to buy a second home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however . Deductions have to be spread over the life of the mortgage . FOR THE 39.6% BRACKET 1994 TAXABLE INCOME ABOVE $250,000 FOR BOTH JOINT FILERS AND SINGLES ; FOR ' 95 , IT 'S $256,500 Do n't count on the Republicans to roll back the tax-the-rich rate hike that created this extra " bracket " in ' 93 . Put one or both of the following strategies to use : * Set up a defined-benefit Keogh . If you 're 45 or older and self-employed , investigate this potential monster of a shelter . Like other defined-benefit pensions , this special type of Keogh is based on your life expectancy plus the amount you want to draw down as an annuity when you retire . The maximum benefit you can receive is your average income over your three top earning years or $120,000 , whichever is less . The cost of hiring an actuary to administer such a plan is n't cheap , however : up to $3,000 to set one up and around $1250 a year . You have until Dec. 29 to open a ' 95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 , 1996. * Seek out a rabbi to defer compensation if you can . Many companies offer so-called rabbi trusts to high-paid executives ( so named because the method was first used by a congregation for its rabbi ) . Your employer sets up an irrevocable trust , stashes money in it every year for you and pays the income tax on the fund . You then have retirement dollars building up to be spent when you are presumably in a lower tax bracket . However , you have no control over your trust , which can even be seized by creditors to pay your employer 's debts . So be confident in your company 's long-term health before asking for the rabbi 's blessing . <p>
