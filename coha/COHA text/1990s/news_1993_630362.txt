<p> Q. Q. I read your review of " The Good Son , " and as both a parent and a school psychologist , I could n't agree with you more . The movie is violent for the sake of violence . Unintended consequences of scenes like the Highway Man are likely . Macaulay Culkin is a hero for many youngsters who are too young to separate the actor from the character . They may be prone to confusion , psychological distress and possibly increased aggression as a result . So the movie was rated R ? Since when has that ever been enforced ? Is there anything that can be done discourage future productions of movies like this ? <p> David Hardy , Carlisle , Pa . <p> A. Unfortunately , the movie has been successful at the box office , so there may yet be a " Good Son II . " You mention the scene where Culkin throws a dummy off a bridge and causes a traffic pileup . A reader , Michael Beemer , informs me that last Halloween , near Detroit , pranksters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman swerved to avoid hitting what she thought was a person and was killed . It is chilling to reflect that this incident , far from deterring the filmmakers , may have inspired the Highway Man scene . <p> Q. Computer science has reached the point where producing a synthetic , realistic , original full-length movie with stars like Gable , Astaire , Garland , Bogart , etc. , is possible . These are not just lifts from old movies ( such as in soda commercials ) , but full-action computer models , convincingly real in speech and visual appearance . I look forward with antici <p> pation to these new synthetic movies because they combine old talents with new directors and writers . How about morphing the looks of a Clark Gable with the dancing skill of Astaire and the voice of Pavarotti ? <p> Lloyd E. Clark , Millersville , Md . <p> A. And the legs of Betty Grable ? The use of Frankenactors is immoral  --  a violation of the rights of the dead to have the book closed on their own lives . What actor would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a computer ? If we see new movies with a computerized Bogart , will those " performances " then affect our view of his actual work ? <p> Such appropriation of images is artistic theft . The people who make those TV commercials with ripped-off footage from old movies should be ashamed of themselves . As punishment , they should be forced to watch porno flicks starring their grandmothers . <p> Q. I recently rented " The Verdict , " one of my favorite Paul Newman films . In your book Roger Ebert 's Movie Home Companion , you give it four stars , but then you write , " . . . it has a lot of truth in it , right down to a great final scene in which Newman , still drinking , finds that if you wash it down with booze , victory tastes just like defeat . " But Newman is n't still drinking ! He 's sitting in his office , sipping coffee . You got it wrong . Do yourself a favor and watch the last five minutes again . Humor me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . I still sense that it 's not coffee in the cup . For an informal survey , I posted your question in the ShowBiz Forum on CompuServe . Here are some replies : <p> " My impression has always been that the Newman character booted the booze at the end , as part of his ' redemption , ' and whatever he was drinking was sans alcohol . Jon Woolf , Beavercreek , Ohio <p> " Well , having just dragged out the laserdisc : He 's asleep at his desk , the phone startles him awake , he ignores the phone , and takes a sip from the mug on the desk . He then goes back to sleep . During this scene , he 's upset over his failed relationship with Charlotte Rampling . On the whole , I do n't think it was coffee . " <p> James M. Curran , Bloomfield , N.J. <p> " I do n't think Newman drinking again would have fit very well with the redemption theme of the film . His summation seemed far too coherent for someone who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PC magazine <p> Q. The Star recently ran an item saying that you got a call from an outraged Woody Allen , furious that you revealed the ending to his " Manhattan Murder Mystery " on the " Siskel &; Ebert " program . " Woody made a huge fuss , " the paper said , " and told the roly-poly reviewer that the show would no longer get advance clips from his movies . " Is this item true ? What else did Woody say ? <p> Harris Allsworth , Chicago <p> A. The item is completely fictitious . Woody never called , made no threats , withheld no clips . Nor did I reveal the ending , except in an indirect way . The Star 's article about my recent weight loss was completely accurate , however  --  although since they call me " roly-poly " here , I guess they did n't believe it . <p> Q. The credits at the end of films are obviously made for the big screen , and when they roll past on home video , they 're too small to read . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baxter , Chapel Hill , N.C. <p> A. Larger titles would take even longer to roll past , and some are already approaching the 10-minute mark . Exhibitors believe few people read the titles ; briefer titles increase the time available for selling popcorn , etc . That 's why some theaters close the curtains while the titles are still running . Larger titles on home video , especially collector 's editions , would be a bonus , though . <p> Q. I heard that Spike Lee is going to shoot a movie in Chicago 's Hyde Park neighborhood . True ? <p> Ronnie Barzell , Chicago <p> A. Lee has purchased the rights to a University of Chicago Press best seller named Slim 's Table : Race , Respectability and Masculinity by Michael Duneier , which records the conversations and friendships of a group of men who gather for lunch in Hyde Park every day . He wants to use it as the basis for a TV series about black male workers and heads of families , who are almost invisible in the mass media . Lee will probably only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to know why , in the movie " Hero , " Chevy Chase is n't listed in the credits . <p> Dan Gerson , Santa Clara , Calif . <p> A. As an ego thing , stars sometimes pass up billing for supporting roles . Co-stars of Dustin Hoffman , the hero of " Hero , " seem to have a special fondness for the practice ; Bill Murray was also uncredited for his funny work as Hoffman 's roommate in " Tootsie . " <p> Q. " Jurassic Park " is just a remake of an old Japanese film . Am I the only one to remember it ? Unfortunately , I have forgotten the title . Godzilla and all the other monsters were kept on an island under scientific supervision . As you can imagine , they escaped to terrorize the world . <p> Dorothi St. Ives , Chicago <p> A. You may be thinking of " Godzilla on Monster Island " ( 1972 ) , which was , of course , the first movie in which Godzilla talked . The original twist in the Spielberg film was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , all of the actors could speak much better than Godzilla . <p> Q. In " Jurassic Park , " why do the electrically powered cars have ignition keys and gear shifts ? When T. Rex turns one over , why do you clearly see an exhaust system underneath ? The one thing you do n't see is any kind of pickup device making a connection between the cars and the rail rain the vehicles are supposed to run along . Somebody ought to take Spielberg for a ride on the L sometime , so he can learn how electric vehicles work . <p> Bill Becwar , <p> Chicago <p> A. Better still , in the sequel , maybe he could have one of the dinosaurs attack the L , in the great tradition of King Kong . <p> Q. I saw you on Letterman with Gene Siskel . You were discussing " Free Willy " when you made a cutting remark about Gene 's weight being similar to the killer whale 's . Was that a media thing ? <p> Jim McNeely , Fresno , Calif . <p> A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have us confused . It was Siskel who made the remark about my weight . I was the one who used admirable restraint in not observing that Gene should have identified with Willy because they are both hairless mammals . <p> Q. Did you really like " Castle of Fu Manchu " ? The " Mystery Science Theater " critics said , " Roger Ebert liked this ! " <p> Don Donovan <p> A. I 've never seen it . Maybe they had me confused with Gene Siskel . Happens all the time . <p> SEPARATING FACT FROM FICTION <p> Q. I am Cheryl Sites , alias the character " Pearl " in the movie " This Boy 's Life . " I take exception to your references about my father in your review . How can you state as fact incidents regarding our lives when very little in the movie is true ? My father did n't die in Concrete , Ore. , and in fact , we never lived in Concrete ! There was no love lost between my father and " Jack " ( the character based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent relationship depicted in the movie , either . " Jack " did n't toil at his paper route , only to have my father steal his money . I shared that route . We used the money to buy what we wanted . <p> I do n't understand why it was important to portray my father as an idiot , when in fact , he was an intelligent man and had a much better vocabulary than " Shut your pie hole ! " I 'm sorry life was miserable for " Jack , " and it was , but a good deal of it was brought on my his own actions and prevarications . I do n't intend to make my father a saint , because he was n't and we did n't have the " Leave It to Beaver " or " Father Knows Best " household , but it was n't all bad , either . <p> Cheryl Sites , Kent , Wash . <p> A. I made the mistake , common to movie reviewers , of discussing the characters in a movie as if they were real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously based much more on artistic inspiration than on fact , and as a general rule , when the words " The following is a true story " appear on the screen , they 're as fictional as anything that follows . <p> WHAT ARE YOU , GOOFY ? <p> Q. This may seem like a goofy question , but is Goofy a dog ? My daughter says he does n't have a species , he 's just a cartoon character . Now wait , I argued . Donald is a duck , Mickey is a mouse , and Pluto is most definitely a dog . Goofy has what appear to be canine teeth , lop ears and a snout . Is he a dog or not ? <p> Vic Sussman , Washington , D.C. <p> A. My rule is this : If they walk upright , they 're cartoon characters . If they walk on all fours , they 're dogs . Maybe it would help you to think of Goofy as a little further up the evolutionary ladder than Pluto . <p> ' THE FUGITIVE ' KIND <p> Q. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison Ford at the end of " The Fugitive " ? <p> Peter Sherman , <p> Monroe , La . <p> A. " An ice pick for his swollen hands , " director Andrew Davis replies . <p> Q. In " The Fugitive , " why was a U.S. marshal involved in the search for an escaped convict in Illinois ? In the movie , Kimble was convicted of a state offense in Cook County Circuit Court and was on his way to a state prison , yet a marshal entered the investigation almost immediately , before there was any evidence that he committed a federal offense . <p> Robert J. Smith <p> A. Back to director Andy Davis again : " It is little known , even within the law enforcement community , that U.S. marshals have long been primarily responsible for fugitives from the law . It was implied in our movie that a joint operation of federal , state and local authorities was set up to investigate the train wreck and that the governor of Illinois had personally asked the U.S. marshal to see to the matter Downstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case would definitely have been handled by the FBI . " @x MAURICE DRUON FINALLY RAN OUT of immortality . That apparently happens to us all , but what made his case special was that he was officially an immortel , thanks to membership in the Acadmie Franaise . Only 40 Frenchmen at a time can be immortels , and since they do depart this life with predictable regularity- about twice a year on average- France lets them enjoy their immortality while still here . Druon , who actively enjoyed his until age 90 , was buried this spring with full military honors and eulogized as a Lord of Letters . A militant cultural conservative who fervently loved his country and its traditions , he spent his life defending them both in and out of the Academy . As a young cavalry officer who refused to accept France 's abject capitulation to the Nazis , he joined de Gaulle 's Free French headquarters in London in the early 1940s . Besides broadcasting information clandestinely to the Resistance , he also wrote the words to the Chant des Partisans , the song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today it is second only to La Marseillaise in its stirring patriotic power . After the war Druon began a distinguished writing career that produced more than 50 titles . In 1966 he was voted into the Academy as its youngest member , thus becoming not only provisionally immortal but also an official guardian of the French language . His rigorous , unfashionable principles while serving as minister of culture in the 1970s infuriated the post-1968 left-wing artistic world , as when he told subsidy-seeking theater directors they had to choose between scorning the values of French society and accepting government handouts . At the Academy Druon assiduously followed the orders laid down by Cardinal Richelieu when he created it in 1635 : " To work with all possible care and diligence to give strict rules to our language and to make it pure , eloquent , and capable of dealing with the arts and sciences . " As chief minister to King Louis XIII , Richelieu had his own reasons for offering state protection to the literary set : it helped put this unruly , often subversive lot under government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they compose a dictionary , along with works on grammar , rhetoric , and poetics . Louis XIV later approved the move , even setting them up in the former Louvre apartment of the queen mother and helpfully donating 40 goose quills they could whittle into pens in their spare time . Language being a serious matter worthy of lengthy reflection , the Academicians have never rushed the dictionary . They presented the first edition to Louis XIV in 1694 after some 60 years of scholarly labor . Their latest effort , the eighth edition , was published in 1935 . They are now pushing ahead with all deliberate speed on the ninth , which after 74 years is already up to the letter M. ( By odious comparison , the new Oxford English Dictionary in 20 volumes was completed in seven years . ) If the Academy 's productivity is low , its symbolism is high . As the great ethnologist Claude LviStrauss , himself an Academician , once told me , " The dictionary is only the visible part of the Academy 's function . As an honorary confraternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its language . Here an individual is judged and classed by the care with which he expresses himself . For Americans , on the other hand , language is just an instrument to be used with total liberty . " I asked if that was bad . " It does give its special savor to American English , " he allowed . " There is this incredible creation of new words and expressions all the time . But it 's a completely different attitude from ours . " Besides tinkering interminably with their dictionary , Academicians keep busy with choosing new members according to vague , never-defined criteria . No academic degrees are necessary , nor is there any age limit . The only real requirements are French nationality and the ability to write a letter declaring candidacy . Then the candidate must visit each member for a get-acquainted meeting . Many who would be obvious shoo-ins , like the late Andr Malraux , decide not to try because they find the process humiliating . Claude Lvi-Strauss disliked the visits because he was so nervous he was always a half-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I understand why they 're necessary , " he told me . " The Academy is like a club ; members want to know if you 're an homme de bonne compagnie . " Once elected , the companionable new member pays a courtesy call on the French president at the Elyse Palace , then gets down to the real fun of ordering his ( or her , a few token women now being admitted ) uniform and ceremonial pe . The elaborate uniform , designed at Napoleon 's command and involving a swallowtail suit embroidered with green olive leaves , takes up to six months to make and costs several thousand dollars- including an ostrichplumed cocked hat . The pe , usually a bejeweled work of art marked with symbols from the bearer 's life and accomplishments , is customarily paid for by the new member 's friends . I once talked with one of the few tailors who make the uniforms . " You should see their eyes light up the first time they put the suit on , " he said . " They suddenly realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change completely . " HEADY STUFF INDEED . But in France such eminence lends itself to mockery by the irreverent , or just plain jealous . Alphonse Daudet , a 19th-century writer who never made the club , satirized its members as " decrepit , broken ... with leaden feet , weak legs , eyes blinking like night animals . " But Gustave Flaubert , who was n't elected either , frankly pinpointed the true attitude of most Frenchmen : " Always denigrate it , but try to be a member . " In fact , the list of greats shunned by the Academy reads like a who 's who of French culture . Ren Descartes was persona non grata because he went to live in Sweden . Blaise Pascal was " only " a mathematician . Molire was an actor and ipso facto not a gentleman . Emile Zola was rejected 24 times because of his harsh literary realism and anti-Establishment position in the Dreyfus Affair . Balzac 's stories were unkind to the bourgeoisie . Baudelaire , Verlaine , Grard de Nerval ? Too bohemian for polite company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handsome domed Institut de France , across the Seine from the Louvre , where the Academy meets . " Only about 60 million Frenchmen want in , " quips Jean Dutourd , the witty , wry author of the classic The Taxis of the Marne and many other works , who has been a member for decades . " Ecclesiastics , farmers , secretaries of Communist Party cells , street cleaners , everybody . It 's the triumph of snobbery , and snobbery is one of the most powerful motivations in the human soul . Especially in France , the land of vanity . " Maurice Druon , a dapper , sophisticated man about town , was surely not immune to the appeal of snobbery . But no one defended the Academy 's traditional values as strongly as he . That involved things like vainly trying to block the election of the former president Valry Giscard d'Estaing on the valid grounds that the man had no visible literary talent . He regularly used the Academy 's bully pulpit to insist on proper French usage , subjunctive mood and all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and journalism . And he was well aware that the institution 's nebulous nature was as much a strength as a weakness . " It 's a complete paradox , " he once said . " It has moral authority , though no one can say exactly what we exercise it over except vocabulary . This authority is evident , but nobody knows its source . " The French love nothing so much as the superfluous . No wonder the Academy is their only institution to survive nearly 375 years of monarchy , revolution , empire , humiliating military defeats , and five constitutions.
