A RECURRING theme in the humanities and social sciences in recent years has been the proposal that meaning and truth are n't at all what the average person ( or even the average academic ) seems to think they are . Literary theorists , philosophers ( both Anglo-American and Continental ) , cultural theorists , ethnographers , semioticians , anthropologists , and sociolinguists have argued , in their various ways , that meaning is indeterminate , that facts are in the eye of the beholder , and that truth is collectively constructed , affected by political , social , and interpersonal forces . The claims range in scope from the relatively constrained ( meaning is jointly constructed by a speaker and addressee ) to the grand ( scientific objectivity is illusory ) . These approaches have led to radical change in both the form and content of scholarship ; some disciplines have been transformed so completely that they would probably be unrecognizable to their earlier practitioners . <p> But some areas of inquiry have been largely unaffected by the tide of academic work flowing in this direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is also true for those ( often quantitatively oriented ) social scientists who study individual mental processes , public opinion , or economic judgment and behavior . Although experimental psychologists , survey researchers , and economists move in different circles than other kinds of scholars , when the two academic cultures meet , the rhetoric can become heated . For those on one end of the ideological spectrum , social scientists who fail to rethink the nature of meaning reveal the naive positivism , if not intellectual bankruptcy , of their disciplines . On the other end of the spectrum , the same social scientists are seen as defending the ramparts against a trendy and dangerous form of relativism . <p> My aim here is to step back from the rhetoric , and to examine more closely why people interested in the mind and individual Judgment ( especially scholars in my discipline , experimental psychology ) should or should not rethink their assumptions about the nature of meaning . Based on empirical examination of language use in conversation , I believe that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positivist ca n't easily dismiss . But the evidence also suggests that there are circumstances where such rethinking may not be necessary . Rethinking Meaning <p> As I see it , psychologists have n't rethought meaning for at least two main reasons . First , most psychologists ' theories are based on longstanding commonsense assumptions about the nature of meaning that do n't seem to need questioning , at least on their face . Second , and more importantly , it has not been demonstrated sufficiently to psychologists , using their own standards of evidence , that such rethinking is necessary or practical . Let me take these issues up in turn . <p> Commonsense Assumptions <p> The ( often unstated ) assumptions about meaning and language that most psychologists bring to the table are n't so different from what most people would endorse as reasonable , or from what they learned in grammar school . They tend to assume that : <p>  --  A word or sentence means what it ( literally ) says . Of course , words and sentences can sometimes be used in poetic , metaphoric , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning deviates from the ordinary and literal . To put it another way , even though words and sentences can be used to mean different things on different occasions , there is a general consensual meaning to a word or sentence ; this is often called the word 's or sentence 's semantics . <p>  --  Communication consists of sending and receiving messages . The messages , encoded in words , themselves transmit ( and thus contain ) meaning , so long as the sender and receiver have the same encoding and decoding rules . <p>  --  Meaning is composed of parts . Phrase or sentence meaning consists of a combination of word meanings . The meaning of " the large cat , " for example , arises out of the conjunction of the meanings of " large " and " cat . " <p> These sorts of assumptions have longstanding roots in Western thought , from Locke and Frege onward , if not earlier . What they have in common is their focus on meaning as being encoded in language itself ; thus such assumptions have been characterized , variously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akmajian et al. , 1990 ) , a " conduit " or " container " metaphor for meaning ( Reddy , 19931979 ) , or a " literary " view of meaning ( Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs , 1986 ) . As starting assumptions , they have informed a tradition of psychological research that focuses on how people understand the literal meanings of sentences or words in isolation . They also underlie literary theorists ' assertions that a work 's meaning is in the text itself , as well as survey researchers ' or **27;495;TOOLONG ' assumptions that a survey or test question can mean the same thing to all respondents or test-takers . <p> For many purposes , these assumptions work fairly well , and that is why some scholars are attracted to them . Why should the assumptions be questioned when listeners regularly understand public-address announcements well enough to act appropriately , people awakened by clock radios hear about the weather and decide what to wear , and newspaper readers understand columnists ' opinions ? The notion that members of a linguistic community understand words the same way allows journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that their customers will understand signs proclaiming " Sale Today , " and politicians to make statements that provoke the same general outrage . <p> While most people ( including psychologists ) would endorse some version of these assumptions , they would probably not disagree with this alternative set of commonsense assumptions about meaning : <p>  --  In a two-party conversation , there are always at least two points of view . Although the points of view may overlap substantially or even entirely , there is no guarantee that they do . Each party must make inferences about what the other believes and assumes , and about the extent to which their beliefs and assumptions agree . <p>  --  Every utterance is merely an attempt to be understood . There is no guarantee that any utterance will be understood at all , let alone exactly as intended . <p>  --  Misunderstandings are usually ( more or less ) reparable . People can often tell when they have been misunderstood ; in fact , sometimes they look for direct evidence that they are being understood . Depending on how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) correct misinterpretations through further conversation . <p> The general flavor here is that what is meant is subject to negotiation , that the conversational partner helps shape the speaker 's utterances , and that what a speaker says is n't necessarily adequate and may need fixing . On this view , meaning  --  what speakers mean by what they say  --  is affected by the various contexts of conversation : the history of what the participants have said , the intentions of the participants , and what the participants believe they mutually know , believe , and assume . <p> This set of assumptions informs other scholarly traditions ; one can see elements of it in the work of theorists as disparate as Bhaktin , Vygotsky , Mead , and Quine , among others . Like the first set of assumptions , this set also seems to account for a large number of ordinary situations . It is easy to think of times when people do n't understand each other as well as might be expected , when one person 's vision of reality does n't square with another 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from different backgrounds , cultures , and worldviews , but also between intimates . <p> These alternative sets of assumptions about meaning are not mutually exclusive , but there is a tension between them . Does meaning reside in words , or is it constantly renegotiated by communicators ? Do words have the same meanings independently of their occasions of use , or do their meanings shift with the context ? Note that this tension is not simply a recapitulation of Frege 's distinction between sense ( Sinn ) and reference ( Bedevtung ) , where , in the classic example , the expressions " the morning star " and " the evening star " both refer to the same entity ( the planet Venus ) but have different meanings ( senses ) . That is , one might propose that the alternative sets of assumptions are really just assumptions about sense ( set 1 ) and reference ( set 2 ) , because senses are fixed but references can shift from occasion to occasion ( the expression " the media hound " can refer to Madonna or Mr. Giuliani on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture the difference between the two sets of assumptions because it is not about negotiability ; in Frege 's original example , both the sense and the reference of " the morning star " are conventional and nonnegotiable . <p> Note also that the tension between the two sets of assumptions is n't simply that the first set is individually oriented and the second set is socially oriented . Implicit in the meaning-in-words assumption is actually a great deal of consensuality : a word 's sense embodies what the word is conventionally used to mean within a linguistic community . The real difference between the two sets of assumptions is in whether word meanings are fixed or negotiable . <p> Psychologists studying mind and language have historically tended to focus on how people produce and comprehend the conventional meaning of words in isolation , and they have tended to ignore how people produce and comprehend words as used on particular occasions ( this is , of course an oversimplification ) . Sometimes this has been quite intentional ; following Chomsky , many researchers explicitly set out to understand speakers ' linguistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than examining their linguistic performance ( the ways their underlying knowledge is expressed on particular occasions ) . <p> Psychologists have also tended to adopt the research strategy of building a theory of mind and language by starting with the parts : if we can understand how words are comprehended in isolation , then we can later figure out how sentences are comprehended . And if we understand how sentences in isolation are comprehended , then we can later try to understand how larger stretches of discourse  --  paragraphs , conversations , novels  --  are comprehended . <p> On the one hand , these approaches have had their notable successes in predicting language production and comprehension in constrained laboratory tasks . On the other hand , they have led to a narrow view of which aspects of context might be affecting real-life language use . In the name of objectivity and parsimony , psychologists too often have examined only the kinds of context that are most easily studied in experiments , most often the immediately preceding linguistic context ( the words that precede the word of interest ) . Far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or beliefs about conversational partners , might influence language use . Evidence that Theories of Meaning Should n't Be Rethought <p> Many psychologists have been leery of rethinking traditional ideas about meaning , not in order to avoid questioning their starting assumptions , but because they believe there are legitimate empirical grounds for those assumptions . Some experiments on how people understand meaning suggest that language processing is more mechanistic and less affected by context than one might think . <p> Consider , for example , David Swinney 's now-classic demonstrations in the 1970s ( for example , Swinney , 1979 ) about how sentence context affects ( or does not affect ) comprehension of ambiguous words . As a moment 's reflection shows , many words that listeners encounter have multiple possible interpretations , at least in isolation . But listeners usually do n't consciously experience all these ambiguities ; they seem to immediately select the meanings appropriate to the current context . Swinney devised a clever technique for assessing whether this intuition is accurate . In his laboratory experiments , people listened to sentences like : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaches , and other bugs in the corner of the room . " This sentence contains the word bug , which in isolation is ambiguous ( at the time , it could either be an insect or a spying device  --  software defects were n't yet common concerns ) ; of course , here the appropriate interpretation is as an insect . In the experiment , as listeners heard sentences like this , they also had to judge whether a string of letters flashed onto a screen in front of them was an English word or not ; this string was timed to flash at the exact moment that they heard the ambiguous word . <p> Listeners made this yes/no judgment more quickly when the string of letters was a word appropriately related in meaning to the ambiguous word they had heard . That is , listeners hearing the word bug could judge that ant was a word more quickly than they could judge that sew was a word . This suggested that hearing the word bug activated the " insect " meaning for the listener , which was appropriate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their judgment more quickly when the string of letters was a word related to the inappropriate meaning of the ambiguous word . That is , listeners hearing the word bug also judged that spy was a word more quickly than they could judge that sew was a word . <p> These findings , then , suggest that when hearing an ambiguous word , listeners seem to activate both the contextually appropriate and the contextually inappropriate meanings , even though they do n't consciously experience the activation of the inappropriate meanings . Subsequent studies demonstrated the time course of this activation : the appropriate meaning remains active over time , while the inappropriate meaning fades away or is suppressed over the next 700 milliseconds . <p> Although these results sparked a furor when they were reported , the general finding that listeners access a cohort of possibilities has remained remarkably robust . Apparently , listeners access multiple meanings for words whether they are appropriate or not , even though they do n't consciously experience accessing the inappropriate meanings . Of course , context matters ; after word senses are activated , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be discarded . But at its core , language processing seems to be a mechanistic ( in Fodor 's parlance , a modular ) process , insensitive to context . <p> If language processing is so mechanistic , the argument goes , then all sorts of contexts  --  including conversational context  --  are of interest only as after-the-fact phenomena . That is , figuring out how and why contextual factors help select word meanings is a separate enterprise . But there 's certainly no need to rethink the assumption that meaning inheres in words . In fact , these experimental results support the assumption : there is a level at which people access meaning ( senses ) in a context-free way . Although words can be used in different ways on different occasions , their senses are activated in the same way whenever they are heard . <p> Although experimental findings like Swinney 's ( among many others ) lead many psychologists to be convinced of their starting assumptions , I argue that things are n't so simple . First , even within the confines of the particular questions and experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results are n't the final word on the processing of ambiguity . Although in study after study people consistently access multiple meanings of ambiguous words , there is evidence that people seem to have greatest access to ( that is , they can respond most quickly to words related to ) the appropriate meanings ( see Simpson , 1994 ) . Also , it seems that certain kinds of sentence contexts do constrain people to accessing only appropriate meanings ( for example , Tabossi , 1988 ) . <p> Second , to venture further afield , other pieces of evidence also do n't fit the standard assumptions so clearly . There is good documentation , for example , that people do n't always comprehend sentences according to what the words say ( see Clark , 1997 , for a review ) . One amusing case was found on the wall of a London hospital , where no one seemed to notice the literal meaning of the sign " No head injury is too trivial to ignore " ( Wason and Reich , 1979 ) . There is also evidence that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehending the metaphoric , ironic , or indirect meanings ( for example , Gibbs , 1983 , 1984 , 1986 , 1987 ; see Gibbs , 1994 , for extended discussion ) ; at least in terms of psychological processes , literal and figurative meaning do n't seem very different . Let us look at additional evidence that focuses explicitly on the influence of conversation . Evidence that Does n't Fit the Standard Assumptions <p> One piece of evidence that is n't easily explained with the standard assumptions comes from a study on eavesdropping that Herbert Clark and I carried out at Stanford University ( Schober and Clark , 1989 ) . Obviously , people who eavesdrop on conversations will have trouble understanding what is said when the conversationalists speak a different language than the eavesdropper , or when they have expertise or shared knowledge that the eavesdropper lacks ; the FBI surely knows all about this . Our question was whether eavesdroppers have trouble understanding when the conversationalists do n't have any of these advantages , that is , when they are strangers talking about an unfamiliar topic on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about meaning  --  if meaning is contained in words  --  in such cases , eavesdroppers should understand exactly as well as the conversationalists , so long as they hear every single word uttered . <p> In the study , pairs of strangers carried out a verbal communication task that allowed us to measure comprehension . They were seated on either side of a visual barrier , and they each had a set of cards with unfamiliar abstract geometric figures on them ; one of them had the cards arranged in a particular order . The pair 's task was to get the other partner 's cards sorted into the same order . The pair could say anything it took to get the cards sorted . Meanwhile , unbeknownst to the pair , an eavesdropper with his or her own set of cards listened to every word the pair said and tried to sort the cards . The task thus allowed us to monitor both what a speaker intended to be talking about at any moment ( because we knew which figure a speaker was attempting to describe ) and also how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could observe whether the cards they placed matched the speaker 's cards ) . <p> The results were quite clear . Although the eavesdroppers understood much of what the pairs said , they never understood quite as well ( the interacting pairs all understood each other virtually perfectly ) . And this continued to be true as the pair sorted the reshuffled figures again and again . Even when eavesdroppers were allowed to listen to an audio recording of what the pairs said , stopping the tape whenever they wanted to think more about what the pair might have meant , their accuracy was no better , although they ( mistakenly ) became more confident that they had understood correctly . <p> This finding is problematic for standard assumptions about meaning . Clearly the speaker 's meaning is n't contained only in the words ; if it were , the eavesdroppers ' comprehension accuracy should have been no worse than the conversationalists . ' What allowed the interlocutors to understand each other so well , and the eavesdroppers to miss out ? Those resources of conversation available only to the interlocutors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to reframe descriptions to suit the partner , the ability to keep trying until they were sure they had understood  --  allowed meaning to be conveyed ( on one view ) , or created ( on another view ) . Referring seems to be a collaborative process , not just an individual one . <p> Not only is the finding problematic for a theory of reference , but it also raises questions for assumptions about sense . Speakers ' descriptions in the study were quite idiosyncratic ; for instance , after substantial negotiation , two different pairs ended up referring to the same figure as " the graduation guy carrying a plate " and " the Hoover Tower figure . " What exactly is the context-free conventional sense of these expressions ? The individual parts certainly have conventional senses in isolation ; " graduation , " " guy , " " carrying , " and " plate " all have dictionary definitions . But their combination does n't have an obvious communitywide conventional sense in the same way as " the large cat " seems to have a conventional sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconventional ways here , creating phrases that have unconventional senses . But this is a contradiction in terms ; if the convention is momentary and exists only for two people , it no longer counts as a culturewide sense . The conversational context has led to what Clark ( 1983 ) called " nonce sense " ; the pair has created a momentary agreement , on the fly , with each other  --  what Brennan and Clark ( 1996 ) have called a " conceptual pact " At least sometimes , sentence meaning is n't simply made up of the combination of the meanings of its parts ; rather , it is constituted with contextual information available only from the act of referring . <p> Another piece of evidence that calls into question standard assumptions about meaning comes from examination of deictic terms : words like I , you , here , there , left , right , now , and then . The meaning of deictic terms can not be in the words themselves ; they only mean anything in the context of their use  --  as referring expressions connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deictic terms embody the second set of assumptions I described before . In any two-party conversation , each speaker means something different by exactly the same words I , you , here , there , left , and right . <p> Of course , I am hardly the first to point out the special nature of deictic terms . But for at least some of these terms , their meaning is even more contextual  --  more conversation-bound  --  than is usually recognized . Consider the word left . If you ask your coffeehouse server which of the two cups of coffee on the counter contains the decaffeinated coffee , and the server tells you that it 's the one " on the left , " what are you to make of this ? Is it the one on your own left , the one on the server 's left , or the one on the left end of the counter ? Although some researchers have suggested that speakers in such ambiguous situations are likely to be egocentric ( see Miller and Johnson-Laird , 1976 ) , the evidence is that perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder to take their partners ' perspectives the greater the disparity in their vantage points ( Herrmann and Grabowski , 1994 ) . And this varies depending on the elements of the scene , and it varies for different conversational partners ; in one study , students were more likely to take the perspective of a professor or of a small child than of another student ( see Herrmann and Grabowski , 1994 ) . <p> Beyond these factors , conversational history affects what speakers mean by spatial descriptions like on the left , and how listeners interpret those descriptions ( see Schober , 1993 , 1995 , 1998a ) . If their conversational partners have done them the favor of taking their perspective beforehand , people seem driven to reciprocate and take the conversational partner 's perspective . And this depends on their assessment of how easy or hard they believe their partners will find it to see things from a different point of view ( Schober , 1998b ) . Interpreting what the word left means in any particular situation is thus an extremely complex matter , involving judgments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms are even more context-bound than they at first seem . <p> These pieces of evidence call into question standard assumptions about meaning , and they argue for a more nuanced , contextual account of how meaning works . But further evidence suggests that under some circumstances the standard assumptions really are the right ones . When the Standard Assumptions Work <p> Why does the meaning-in-words assumption seem to work for written messages ? And why does it work quite often for spoken messages ( for that large percentage that eavesdroppers are able to understand ) ? In both cases , the audience in the act of communication is not in a position to give feedback to the speaker or writer about whether they have understood ; in this respect , readers are like eavesdroppers , who also ca n't give feedback of understanding . But that ca n't be all that makes the meaning-in-words assumption work here , as the two cases are actually quite different : readers are receiving messages designed to be understandable for a general audience that includes them , while eavesdroppers , by definition , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . <p> I argue that the meaning-in-words assumption works when communicators ' underlying conceptualizations of word meanings  --  whether of the words ' senses or of their referents  --  are aligned , or rather when they are aligned closely enough for the communicators ' purposes at the time . ( By conceptualization , I do n't mean to suggest anything permanent or rigid . Conceptualizations change with purposes , from conversation to conversation , even from moment to moment : consider how differently one might conceptualize one 's home when describing it to a potential roommate rather than to a house painter , or one 's job when describing it to one 's boss rather than one 's nephew ) . <p> On this account , the meaning-in-words assumption fails in the eavesdropping case exactly because some percentage of the time the eavesdroppers ' underlying conceptualizations of the speakers ' words do not match the speakers ' conceptualizations . More generally , the meaning-in-words assumption should fail just on those occasions when the speaker 's ( or author 's ) current conceptualization for a particular word does n't sufficiently overlap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptualization . <p> How can this account be tested , using standards of evidence that psychologists can accept ? What is needed are situations where the extent to which two people 's conceptualizations overlap is measurable . One such situation is the kind of survey interview that government agencies use to calculate the unemployment rate and the consumer price index . These surveys are about verifiable facts and behaviors : the number of hours worked last week , the number of bedrooms in the home , whether any furniture was bought last year . Consider the case where a respondent in such a survey is asked whether or not she worked for pay last week . Her answer depends , in part , on her current conceptualization of what counts as " work for pay " for the purposes of the survey . Does her tuition scholarship count as pay ? Do room and board for babysitting count as pay ? In a well-designed survey , the designers of this question have their own conceptualization of what counts as " work for pay "  --  an official definition of what should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their interviewers , as their intermediaries , to understand . <p> In such a situation , the extent to which the respondent 's answer fits the official definition is thus a reasonable index of the extent to which her conceptualization matches that of the interviewer ( or survey designer ) . For example , if the respondent answers " no , " failing to count her tuition scholarship as pay , then we know that her conceptualization of " work for pay " did n't match the survey designers ' conceptualization . Of course , this requires that we know that she actually received a tuition scholarship ; this is why it is essential to examine situations where respondents ' circumstances are verifiable . <p> In such a survey interview , we can examine therefore when and how the meaning-in-words hypothesis is adequate . ( It is ironic that the survey situation can be used for such a test , as the meaning-in-words hypothesis pervades the survey world almost completely , and most survey researchers and consumers of survey data never question it . ) In a series of studies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is adequate only under particular circumstances , and inadequate under others . In the studies , people answer questions from ongoing government surveys asked by professional interviewers . In some studies ( Schober and Conrad , 1997 , in press ) , paid respondents answered the questions on the basis of fictional scenarios that we created , so that we could be sure how well the answers matched the official definitions . In another study ( Conrad and Schober , 1998 ) , people in a national telephone sample answered the survey questions in their homes , and we asked follow-up questions to find out how they had interpreted the questions ( what they had included in their answers ) . <p> We found that people are likely to have the same conceptualization as survey designers ( and that the meaning-in-words assumption is adequate ) when their actual circumstances are prototypical and unproblematic  --  when their life circumstances map onto the question concepts in a straightforward way . That is , respondents who unambiguously have a 9-to-5 job and receive a regular paycheck are almost certain to conceive of their " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey designers . But people whose circumstances are nonprototypical with regard to this survey question  --  for example , people who exchange room and board for their work , or who receive tuition fellowships  --  are far less likely to agree on what counts as " work for pay " ; their interpretations vary widely . As such , they are far less likely to conceive of " work for pay " in the same way as the survey designers , and the meaning-in-words assumptions fails to hold . <p> These findings show that word meaning is n't always stable or consensual enough to support the meaning-in-words assumption . Different people conceptualize exactly the same words  --  bedroom , job , furniture , moving  --  quite differently , as evidenced by what they include or exclude in their answers to these survey questions . Meaning is legitimately characterizable as located in words only when the conceptualizations of the parties involved in the communication are sufficiently aligned . ( Aside from questions about the nature of meaning , the findings raise the practical question for those who analyze survey data of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if enough respondents ' interpretations of survey concepts differ from official definitions , the data could be distorted . ) <p> From everything that we 've considered , one should expect that when conceptualizations are not aligned , conversational interaction can increase the alignment : people who can converse should be able to work together to make sure they are conceiving of things the same way . This is exactly what we found . In our studies , some interviewers were trained to leave the interpretation of questions entirely up to the respondents . This is the usual training in standardized interviewing procedures endorsed by most large survey organizations ( see Fowler and Mangione , 1990 ) ; the argument is that this is the only way to ensure objectivity , because all respondents are exposed to exactly the same stimuli . Other interviewers in our studies were trained to converse with the respondents to make sure that they were interpreting the survey questions in the way the survey designers intended . Although this training made no difference when respondents ' circumstances were prototypical , respondents with nonprototypical situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey designers ' definitions when they conversed with interviewers . <p> So , paradoxically , allowing interviewers to deviate from the standardized interviewing script by conversing with respondents can actually increase the interview 's standardization ( and thus validity ) : respondents are more likely to answer questions on the same basis ( on the desired basis , from the government 's perspective ) . Interviewers achieve this by using the conversational techniques people use in ordinary unscripted conversations . They respond to explicit requests for clarification , they ask follow-up questions to make sure they 've been understood , they explain what they mean by what they say , and they look for evidence that they 've been misunderstood . <p> Of course , even with conversation there 's no guarantee that the respondents ' conceptualizations match the official definitions in every respect . Imagine that a survey respondent has conversed with an interviewer to determine that her tuition scholarship should indeed be counted as work for pay , thus bringing her conceptualization of " work for pay " into alignment with the researcher 's conceptualization , and answering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respondent still might conceive of work for pay differently than the researchers do on other dimensions that she did n't converse with the interviewer about ; for instance , she may believe that , as a general principle , work in exchange for room and board should not count as work for pay . From the point of view of survey researchers , this additional conceptual misalignment is unimportant ; if the respondent does n't actually work in exchange for room and board , it does n't matter to the researcher whether she conceives of that as work for pay or not . In general , all that matters to survey researchers is whether respondents have answered survey questions from the researchers ' point of view on the relevant dimensions ; their additional thoughts are unimportant . <p> This pragmatic approach is sensible for survey researchers . But I believe it is a sensible view of ordinary conversation as well . In ordinary conversation there are no guarantees of successful understanding ; interlocutors can only work to be sufficiently sure they have understood each other on the relevant dimensions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no need to be sure that both parties ' conceptualizations are aligned . If you tell me about your experience at the theater last night , you probably want to make sure that my conceptualization of the plot , the scenery , and the performances ends up much like yours , and we will converse to ensure this alignment . But we probably do n't need to make sure that we conceptualize everything about your experience  --  the upholstery on your seat , the usher 's bow tie  --  in the same way . In a Quinian sense ( n1 ) , perhaps there 's no need for perfect alignment ; perhaps all we need is sufficient alignment to accomplish our current purposes . Is One View of Meaning Right ? <p> Why have the standard assumptions about meaning been so compelling ? In part , it is because they account for a significant percentage of our daily uses of language  --  messages are routinely sent and seemingly understood without negotiation , and we accomplish our purposes sufficiently ( at least sufficiently that we do n't get evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptual misalignment , we often do n't see any evidence of it , or the evidence does n't become noticeable to us because it 's not important . Only now and then do we have noticeable misunderstandings , noticeable failures to conceive of things the same way . It is such cases that lead us to be sympathetic to the second set of assumptions , that meaning is negotiated . <p> Which is the core  --  the real  --  kind of meaning ? On the one hand , some argue that because conversation is the basic site of meaning-making from which all others derive , and because in conversation there is always the potential for negotiation , we should conceive of meaning as inherently collaborative ( for example , Clark , 1996 ) . The meaning-in-words hypothesis is n't right ; it only looks as if it works sometimes because of special cases where the contextual assumptions are so strong that negotiation is n't needed ( see Gerrig , 1989 ) . The counterargument is that these " special cases " are actually the ordinary case ; core meaning is nonnegotiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , specialized function . <p> In some ways , the question itself is a red herring , in that it ignores the practical and scholarly purposes that assumptions about meaning serve . For some enterprises the answer may be irrelevant , however the question is resolved ( if it is indeed resolvable ) . If , for example , we are curious about people 's folk psychological beliefs about the nature of meaning , or if we are interested in people 's interpretations of literary texts , we may not need to know whether meaning is ultimately determinate or indeterminate , negotiable or nonnegotiable . <p> Going further down this road , one might argue that on a practical level the value of rethinking meaning is unclear . Consider Swinney 's approach to studying how people access the meanings of words . Maybe it 's true that the notion of sense is an abstraction , in that it abstracts away from ordinary language use to ( perhaps mythical ) essential meaning . Maybe what listeners in Swinney 's studies are accessing when they hear bug are not senses as traditionally conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most frequently intended when people in their linguistic community use the word bug . But what would be gained by rethinking meaning in such studies ? The model of the mind that the researcher creates and tests will probably look much the same either way , whether it is a semantic network with concepts as nodes and relations as links , a connectionist model where concepts are n't represented in any one place , or some other model . Given what Swinney was trying to model  --  how people access conventional meanings of words in the absence of further evidence about what the speaker intended  --  the meaning-in-words hypothesis seems perfectly adequate . In fact , if Swinney had n't started out with the meaning-in-words hypothesis , he could never have found evidence that meanings are n't always affected by context . <p> Persuasive as such practical arguments might seem , ultimately they are unsatisfying , in part because of the accruing evidence that standard assumptions about meaning are too often inadequate . Carrying out public opinion research under the meaning-in-words assumption , for example , has the potential to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in questions in radically different ways . Only if one is reasonably certain that respondents all have prototypical circumstances is the meaning-in-words assumption viable , and this is surely a rare event . All too often the meaning-in-words assumption is risky , and the researcher who adopts it must accept the potential loss of certainty about data quality that the assumption brings . <p> Psychologists have , unfortunately , been less sophisticated about meaning than they might . It would be preferable if they were always clear about their starting assumptions , and if they recognized where their starting assumptions may have limited their endeavors . Some of this lack of sophistication stems from the research strategies that many psychologists adopt , which steer them toward a level of analysis that ignores the more compelling contexts of ordinary life . Comprehension of word senses in isolation is studied far more often than comprehension of full-bodied speaker meaning . Far more attention is paid to what happens in the first milliseconds of comprehension than to the more context-bound subsequent moments of interpretation and appreciation ( Gibbs , 1994 ) . This leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the relative scarcity of evidence leaves many psychologists unconvinced that meaning is worth rethinking . Perhaps to their credit , psychologists will maintain a skeptical attitude about which aspects of context matter , and when , until they have sufficient evidence that uses their methodological tools and standards of evidence . <p> Ultimately , these fundamental questions about the nature of meaning are not merely academic . Assumptions about meaning  --  too often the wrong ones  --  come into play in the design of intelligence tests , college placement exams , personality tests , computer interfaces , and tax forms . And a number of the thorniest public debates of recent years have turned on fundamental assumptions about the nature of meaning . When a boss calls his female secretary " Honey , " has he sexually harrassed her ? In part , it depends on whether the meaning of " Honey " lies in the boss 's statedly innocent intention to be friendly , in the secretary 's perception that " Honey " is the symbolic tip of the sexist iceberg , or in what the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are particular literary works by particular dead white males essential to the canon ? In part , it depends on whether the meaning and merit of a work lie in the text itself , in the presumed intentions of the authors , in undergraduate readers ' perceptions , or in the social and political circumstances of the day . <p> Of course , these are political , philosophical and moral questions as much as psychological ones . But the psychological questions involved  --  the nature of intentions , perception and misattribution , the mental representation of conventions  --  are often underemphasized in the debates , and they strike me as central . To the extent that empirical examination of conversational language use can provide evidence about the nature of meaning that is acceptable even to staunch skeptics , it is an important tool for approaching controversies like these that rest on assumptions about meaning . <p>
