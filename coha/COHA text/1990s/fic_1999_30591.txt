When Jack McGill 's phone rang at two in the morning , the sound cut sharply into the muted world of a soupy San Francisco night . He had been lying in bed sincetwelve , unable to sleep . His mind was too filled , too troubled . The sudden sound jolted already jittery nerves . In the time that it took him to grab for the phone , a dozen jarring thoughts came and went . " Yes ? " " Is this Jack McGill ? " asked a voice he did n't know . It was female and strained . " Yes . " " I 'm Katherine Evans , one of Rachel 's friends . There 's been an accident . She 's at the hospital in Monterey . I think you should come . " Jack sat up . " What kind of accident ? " " Her car was hit and went off the road . " His stomach knotted . " What road ? Were the girls with her ? " " Highway One , and , no , she was alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least . " She was near Rocky Point , on her way to Carmel . A car rammed her from behind . The impact pushed her across the road and over the side . " His feet hit the floor . The knot in his stomach tightened . " She 's alive , " the friend went on . " Only a few broken bones , but she has n't woken up . The doctors are worried about her brain . " " Worried how ? " " Bruising , swelling . " He pushed a hand through his hair . The disquieting thoughts about work that had kept him awake were gone , replaced by a whole different swarm . " The girls  --  " "  --  are still home . Rachel was on her way to book group . When nine o'clock came and she had n't shown up , I called the house . Samantha said she 'd left at seven , so I called the state police . They told me there 'd been an accident , and ID 'd her car . They were still trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know howse sent to bed with empty reassurances , too young to face this possible nightmare alone . Rachel was their caretaker , companion , confidant . The three were thick as thieves . The doctors are worried about her brain , the friend had said . Well , of course , they would worry until things checked out . He tossed cold water on his face and brushed his teeth . Minutes later he entered his studio  --  and in a moment 's dismay wondered why he still called it that . It had become more a place of business than of art . What few drawings he had done were buried under proposals , spec sheets , contracts , and correspondence  --  the refuse of an insane number of construction projects in various stages . The place reeked of pressure . Using the slate gray of dawn that filtered through the skylights , he crammed his briefcase with his laptop and as many vital papers as would fit , and his portfolio with multiple versions of the Montana design . Tucking both under an arm , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't need a light . The place was streamlined and minimal . Grabbing his keys from the granite island and a blazer from the coat tree by the door , he set the alarm and went down to the garage below . Within minutes , he was backing out the BMW and speeding down Filbert . His headlights cut a pale gray swath in the smoky night , lighting little of Russian Hill . Other than the occasional street corner lump that could as easily be a homeless person sleeping as trash waiting for pickup , San Francisco was one big foggy cocoon . Pressing numbers by feel on his car phone , he called information . He was heading south on Van Ness by the time he got through to the hospital in Monterey . " This is Jack McGill . My wife , R achel Keats , was brought in a little while ago . I 'm on my way there . Can you give me an update ? " " Hold on , please . " Several nerve-wracking minutes later , he connected with a nurse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in surgery . That 's about all we know at this point . " " Is she conscious ? " " She was n't when they took her upstairs . " The doctors are worried about her brain . " What 's the surgery for ? " " Would you hold on a minute ? " " I 'd rather not  --  " The sudden silence at the other end said he had no choice . He 'd had no choice when Rachel had moved out six years ago , either . She had said she was going , had packed up the girls and their belongings while he was away on business . He had come home to an echoing house , feeling as thwarted and helpless then as he felt now . Then , armored in anger , he had sold the house moved to one that did n't echo . But now , there was no such out . Her face came to him with every shift of fog , an urban Rorschach in which her features beautiful one minute , bruised the next . His nervous heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster . " Mr. McGill ? " came a male voice , choppy over speaker but audible . " I 'm Dr. Culey . I treated your wife when she arrived . " " What 's the surgery for ? " he shouted , gripping the steering wheel . " To set her left leg . Compound fractures , both femur and tibia . They 'll be inserting pins  --  " " I was told there were head injuries , " he cut in . A person did n't die from a broken leg . " Has she regained consciousness ? " " No . There 's some cranial swelling . We do n't know what direction it 'll take . " " I want a specialist called . " " Our man is on his way . When will you be here ? " " I 'm just leaving San Francisco . " " Two hour s , then ? " " Less , " Jack said and , slowing but barely , sailed through a red light . " Here 's my cell number . " He rattled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will you ? " When the doctor agreed , Jack punched out another set of numbers . He was n't as quick to press send this time , though . He did n't know what to say to the girls . They were n't babies anymore . And teenagers today were a different breed from the ones he had known . Add the fact that he no longer lived with them , and that they were girls , and he was at a triple disadvantage . But this time he could n't pass the buck . There was no one else to take it . Katherine . That was the friend 's name . Katherine . Rachel had never mentioned her , but then , Rachel never mentioned anything that did n't deal directly with the girls . The girls had spoken of her , though . He thought he remembered that . They definitely had mentioned Duncan Bligh , and more than once . He was the rancher who shared Rachel 's canyon . The sloping meadow where his herd grazed lay above her redwood forest . Both meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east of the Big Sur coast . Jack had a bad feeling about Duncan . He did n't like the affectionate way the girls described his cabin , his beard , or his sheep . He did n't like the way they grinned when he asked if Rachel was dating him . Oh sure , he knew they were trying to make him jealous . The problem was that he could see Rachel with a man like that . Mountain men had a kind of rugged appeal . Not that Jack was a slouch . He was tall . He was fit . He could hammer a nail with the best of the carpenters who built what he designed , but he did n't chop down the trees from which the two-by-fours came , and he did n't shear sheep or shoot deer . Did he want to talk to Duncan Bligh in the middle of the night ? No . Nor , though , could he let his daughters think that the rancher was the only man around . He pressed send . The first ring was barely done when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lifted the phone . " Hi , Sam . It 's Dad . Are you guys okay ? " " How 's Mom ? " " She 's okay . " He kept his voice light . " I 'm on my way to the hospital . I just talked with the doctor . They 've taken her into surgery . It sounds like she smashed up her leg pretty good . " " Katherine said it was her ribs , too . " " It may be , but the leg is the thing that needs setting . Refresh my memory , Sam . Who is Katherine ? " " Mom 's best friend , " Samantha said impatiently . " I gave her your number . " " You could have called me yourself . " She grew defensive . " I did n't know if you were around , and if you were n't , you 'd have had to book flight and wait at the airport , and then if you missed connection , you 'd have taken forever to get here . Besides , Katherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " " I can be there , " he said , but the words were no sooner out than he imagined her retort . So he added a " Let 's not argue , Samantha . This is n't the time . " " Are you telling me the truth ? Is Mom really okay ? " " That 's the truth as I heard it . Is your sister sleeping ? " " She was until the phone rang . We knew it had to about Mom . My friends would n't call in the middle the night , " she said with such vehemence that Jack expected they had done it more than once . " Dad , we want to go to the hospital , but Duncan wo n't take us . " " Is he there now ? " " He 's asleep on the chair . Asleep at a time like this . Can you belie ve it ? Wait , I 'll put him on . Tell him to drive us up . " She shouted away from the phone and even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the phone ! It 's my father ! " " Samantha ! " Jack called to get her back . Her reply was muffled . " No , Mom is not dead , but that cat will be if you do n't let her go . You 're holding her too tight , Hope . You 'll hurt her . " She returned to Jack . " Here . Hope wants to talk . " " Daddy ? " The voice was a fragile wisp . Jack 's heart shifted . " Hi , Hope . How 're you doin ' sweetie ? " " Scared . " " I figured that , but your mom 's doing fine right now . I 'm on my way to the hospital . I 'll know more when I get there . " " Come here , " begged the small voice . " I will , " he said , melting at the idea that at least one of his girls needed him . " But the hospital 's on the way , so I 'll stop there first . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Tell Mom  --  " She stopped . " What , sweetie ? " Samantha came on . " She 's crying again . Here 's Duncan . " " Duncan Bligh here . " The voice was curt . " What 's the word ? " Jack wanted Hope back . But it was n't his night . " The word is that I do n't know much . I 'll be at the hospital within the hour . Do n't drive them up . " " I was n't about to . " There was a muted protest in the background , then an aggrieved Samantha returned . " Daddy , it 's sick sitting around here while she 's there . " " It 's the middle of the night . " " Like we can sleep with her there ? She 's our mother . What if she asks for us ? " " She 's in surgery , Samantha . Even if you were at hospital , you would n't be able to see her . Look , if you want to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I 'm not ? " Jack could hear t he tight panic that was taking her voice a step beyond brash . But Samantha was n't Hope . Two years apart in age , they were light-years apart in personality . Samantha was fifteen going on thirty , a know-it-all who did n't take kindly to being treated like child . Thirteen-year-old Hope was sensitive and silent . Samantha would ask the questions . Hope would see every nuance of the answers . " I 'm sure you 're upset , too , " he said , " but you 're older than she is . Maybe if you help her , she 'll help you . Give each other strength , y'know ? " " I keep thinking about Highway One , Dad . Some of those places , if you go over the side , you fall hundreds feet straight down , right onto rocks . Was that what happened to Mom ? " " I do n't know the details of the accident . " " She might have fallen into water , but that 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stuck underwater in the car  --  " " Sam , she did n't drown . " " You do n't know that . You do n't know whether the only thing that 's keeping her alive is a bunch of machines . " " Samantha . " She was nearly as creative as Rachel , without the maturity to channel it . " Your mother has broken leg . " " But you do n't know what else , " she cried . " Call the troopers . They 'll tell you what happened . " " Maybe later . The doctor has my cell number . I want to leave the line open in case he tries to call . And I want you to go to bed . It does n't do anyone any good if you start imagining what might have happened . Imagination 's always worse . So calm down . I 'm in control of things here . And do n't sit up waiting for the phone to ring , because I 'm not calling you again until after the sun comes up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll discuss that later . Right now , the one thing you can do to help your mother most is to reassure your sister . And get some sleep . Both of you . " " Yeah , right , " she muttered . Jack concentrated on driving . The fog had stayed in the city , leaving the highway dark and straight . He pressed his middle in the hope that the warmth of his hand would ease the knot there , but his palm was cold and the knot stayed tight . Nerves did that to him every time . Lately , it seemed the knot was there more often than not . He willed the phone to ring with the news that Rachel had awoken from surgery and was just fine . But the phone remained still , the interior of the car silent save the drone of the engine . He tried to distract himself with thoughts of all he had been agonizing over in bed less than two hours before  --  contract disputes , building delays , personnel losses  --  but he could n't connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city fog . He would have calls to make , come morning . There were meetings to reschedule . Or if Rachel woke up , he might be back in the office by noon . That was likely , the more he thought about it . Rachel was the strongest , healthiest woman he knew  --  strongest , healthiest , most independent and self-sufficient . She did n't need him . Never had . Six years ago , she reached a fork in the road of her life and gone off in different direction from him . Her choice . Her life . Fine . So why was he heading south ? Why was he postponing even one meeting to run to her bedside ? She had left him . She had taken ten years of marriage and crumpled it up , like a sketch on yellow trace that was so far off mark it was worthless . Why was he heading south ? He was heading south because her friend had called him . And because it was his job as a father to help out with the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His life with her had been better than anything before or since . He was heading south because he felt that he still owed her for that . The very first time Jack had laid eyes on Rachel , he decided that she was n't his type . Oh , he liked blond hair , and she had endless waves of that , but he usually went for model types . Rachel Keats did n't fit that bill . She looked too pure . No long eyelashes , no glossy mouth , no flagrant sexuality , just dozens of freckles scattered over a nose and cheeks that were vaguely sunburned , and eyes that were focused intently on the most boring professor Jack had ever heard . The subject was rococo and neoclassic art . The professor , renowned in his field , was the man whose grant was paying for Jack 's architectural degree . In exchange for that , Jack graded exams and papers and helped with research and correspondence to do with the textbook for which the grant had been given . Jack was only marginally interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving from Manhattan to Tucson , but the slot had been the only one open that offered a full ride plus a stipend . Being penniless , Jack needed both . The job was n't taxing . The professor in question had been delivering the same lectures , from the same printed lesson plan , for twenty-plus years . Since Jack read the lectures beforehand , his presence in the lecture hall was more for the sake of fetching water or a forgotten book or paper for the professor than anything educational for himself . He sat far off to the professor 's side , where he could be easily accessed . It was a perfect spot from which to view the fifty-some-odd students who attended a given class , out of three times that many enrolled in the course . Rachel Keats attended every class , listened raptly , took notes . Jack told himself that his eye sought her out for the simple constancy of her presence . It did n't explain , though , why he noted that she went from class to lunch at the smallest campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove an old red VW bug and put a sunshade on the dash that was surely hand-painted , since he had never in his life seen as large or vividly colored a bug sitting behind the wheel of a car as her sunscreen hilariously depicted . She was an art major . She lived in an apartment complex not far from his . She was a loner by all accounts and , if the easygoing expression she wore meant anything , was content . Not only was n't she his type , but he was dating someone who was . Celeste was tall and leggy , loaded up top and sweet down below , asked precious few questions and made precious few demands , liked the sex enough that he could do what he wanted when he wanted in between . She cooked and cleaned his bathroom but he had n't been able to con her into doing his laundry . That was why he found himself in the laundromat on a Tuesday night when Rachel came through the door . Those waves of blond hair were gathered up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorts and sandals were white and as fresh as the blush that stained those sun-stained cheeks when she saw him there . In the extra-long heartbeat that she spent at the door , he could have sworn she was debating turning and leaving . Not wanting her to do that , he said , " Hey ! How 're you doing ? " She smiled . " Great . " The blush remained . She sucked in her lips , raised her brows , and seeming self-conscious , hugged an overstuffed laundry bag as she looked down the row of washers for raised lids . " Ah , " she said , spotting two side by side . She smiled at him again and headed toward them . Jack 's heart was pounding . He did n't know why . All she 'd done was smile . There had n't been anything remotely sexual in it . She was n't his type at all . But he slid off the dryer he 'd been sitting on , and following her , he leaned up against the machine that backed on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art ? " he prompted . He did n't want her to think this was a blind pickup , because it was n't a pickup at all . She was n't his type . He assumed that was why she intrigued him . It was safe . No risk . Just an innocuous hello . She acknowledged the connection with a simple " Uh-huh . " She was blushing still , pushing dirty laundry from the mouth of her laundry bag into the mouth of the washer . He watched her for a minute , then said , " Mine 's in the dryer . " It was probably the dumbest line he 'd ever handed a woman . But he could n't tell her that she was pushing reds and whites together into her machine . He could n't ask if the reds were shirts , bras , or briefs . He could n't even look directly at those things , because she would have been mortified . Besides , he could n't take his eyes from hers . They were hazel with gold flecks , and more gentle than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TA , " she said as she filled the second machine with things that went way beyond red . Her current outfit was conservative by comparison . " Are you training to teach ? " " No . I 'm in architecture . " She smiled . " Really ? " " Really , " he sa id , smiling back . She really was a sweet thing , smiling like that . The sweetness remained even when she suddenly opened her mouth and looked around  --  left , right , down , back . Jack returned to his own possessions and offered her his box of soap powder . He was rewarded with another blush and a murmured " Thanks . " When she had both machines filled with soap , fed with quarters , and started , she asked , " What kind of things do you want to build ? " The question usually came from his parents and filled with scorn . But Rachel Keats seemed genuine interested . " Homes , for starters , " he said . " I come from a two-bit town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those little boxes on the way to school and spend my class doodling them into something finer . Those doodles did n't help my math grade much . " " No . I would n't think it . " She shot a glance at the textbook that lay open on his dryer . " Is the book on home designs ? " " Not yet . Right now we 're into arches . Do you know how many different kinds of arches there are ? There are flat arches , round arches , triangular arches , pointed arches . There are hand arches , back arches , groin arches . There are depressed arches . There are diminished arches . There are horseshoe arches . " She was laughing , the sound as gentle as her eyes . " I do n't think I want to know what some of those are . " She paused for the briefest time , said almost shyly , " I was a doodler , too . " He liked the shyness . It made him feel safe . " Where ? " " Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mobile . My dad takes old businesses turns them around . We move when he sells . How about you ? " " Oregon . You wo n't have heard of the town . It does n't make it onto maps . What did you doodle ? " " Oh , people , birds , animals , fish , anything that moves . I like doing what a camera does , capturing an instant . " " Are you still doodling ? " he asked in response to her use of the present tense . She lifted a shoulder , shy , maybe modest . " I like to think it 's more . I 'm hoping to paint for a living . " " With or without a day job ? " Jack asked . The average artist barely earned enough to eat . Unless Rachel was significantly better than average , she would have a tough time paying the bills . She wrapped her arms around her middle . Quietly , almost sadly , she said , " I 'm lucky . Those businesses keep selling . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm crazy to be here doing this . Art is n't business . They want me back in the city wearing designer dresses with a designer handbag and imported boots . " She took a fresh breath . " Do you have siblings ? " " Five brothers and a sister , " he said , though it had nothing to do with anything . He rarely talked about family . The people he was with rarely asked . Not only had Rachel asked , but those wonderful eyes of hers lit up with his answer . " Six ? That 's great . I do n't have any . " " That 's why you think it 's great . There were seven of us born in ten years , living with two parents in a three-bedroom house . I was the lucky one . Summers , I got the porch . " " What are the others doing now ? Are they all over the country ? Are any of them out here ? " " They 're back home . I 'm the only one who made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why you ? How ? " " Scholarship . Work-study . Desperation . I had to leave . I do n't get along with my family . " " Why not ? " she asked in such an innocent way that he actually answered . " They 're negative . Always criticizing to cover up what they lack , but the only thing they really lack is ambition . My dad coulda done anything he wanted  --  he 's a bright guy  --  only , he got stuck in a potato processing plant and never got out . My brothers are going be just like him , different jobs , same wasted potential . I went to college , which makes what they 're doing seem smaller . They 'll never forgive me for that . " " I 'm so sorry . " He smiled . " Not your fault . " " Then you do n't go home much ? " " No . And you ? Back to New York ? " She crinkled her nose . " I 'm not a city person . When I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate . " Do n't you have friends there ? " " A few . We talk . I 've never had to go around with a crowd . How about you ? Got a roommate ? " " Not on your life . I had enough of those growing up to never want another one , at least not of the same sex . What 's your favorite thing in Tucson ? " " The desert . What 's yours ? " " The Santa Catalinas . " Again those eyes lit , gold more than hazel . " Do you hike ? " When he nodded , she said , " Me , too . When do you have time ? Are you taking a full course load ? How many hours a week do you have to give to Obermeyer ? " Jack answered her questions and asked more of his own . When she answered those without seeming to mind , he asked more again , and she asked her share right back . She was n't judgmental , just curious . She seemed as interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he liked and did n't like as he was in her answers . They talked nonstop until Rachel 's clothes were clean , dry , and folded . When , arms loaded , they finally left the laundromat , he knew three times as much about her as he knew about Celeste . Taking that as a message of some sort , he broke up with Celeste the next day , c alled Rachel , and met her for pizza . They picked right up where they had left off at the laundromat . Jack was fascinated . He had never been a talker . He did n't like baring his thoughts and ideas , held them close to the vest , but there was something about Rachel that felt ... safe , there it was again . She was gentle . She was interested . She was smart . Being as much of a loner as he was , she seemed just as startled as he to be opening up to a virtual stranger , but they gave each other permission . He trusted her instinctively . She seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply as that , they became inseparable . They ate together , studied together , sketched together . They went to movies . They hiked . They huddled before class and staked out their favorite campus benches , but it was a full week before they made love . In theory , a week was no time at all . In practice , in an age of free sex with two people deeply attracted to each other , it was an eternity , and they were definitely attracted to each other . No doubt about that . Jack was hit pretty fast by the lure of an artist 's slender fingers and graceful arms . He did n't miss the way her shorts curved around her butt or the enticing flash of midriff when she leaned a certain way . The breasts under her tank tops were small but exquisitely formed . At least , that was the picture he pieced together from the shadow of shapes and the occasional nob of a nipple . The fact that he did n't know for sure kept him looking . Was she attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightest when he was closest . There was the way she leaned into him , so subtle , when they went to a campus concert , and the way her breath caught when he came close to whisper someth ing in her ear . All that , even without her eyes , which turned warm to hot at all appropriate times . Oh , yes , she wanted him . He could have taken her two days after the laundromat . He did n't because he was afraid . He had never had a relationship like this with a woman before . Physical , yes . But not emotional , not psychological , not heart-to-heart . Rachel made him feel comfortable enough to say what he thought and felt . Not knowing how sex would mix with that , he avoided taking her to his apartment or going to her apartment , avoided even kissing her . A week of that was more than an eternity . He 'd had it with avoidance by the time she invited him over for dinner and apparently she had , too . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a scorcher , purity in flames , hotter and hotter as they slid along the wall to her room and fell on the bed . There was a mad scramble to get clothes off and be close and inside  --  it was heaven for Jack , the deepest , most overwhelming lovemaking he had ever in his life dreamed could take place . When it was done , she sat on the bed with pencil and paper and drew him , and what emerged said it all . With her hands , her mind , her heart she made him into something finer than he had ever been before . She was his angel , and he was in love .
