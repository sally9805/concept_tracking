The suicide squeeze is cool , and the double steal is all right , but a guy who can smack the bejeezus out of a ball  --  that 's the guy for us . Like most great things American , the home run deconstructs strategy with a beautiful act of aggression . So Mark McGwire , 250 lbs . of muscle in a game full of the fat and unfit , does n't really shock when he sends the ball more than 500 ft . And Ken Griffey Jr. , hat backwards , grin cocksure , seems almost bored as he gently taps homers over the fence . The crowd expects it , the crowd gets it , and the crowd goes home happy . We delight in the obvious . Give us a 6 ft. 5 in. guy named McGwire , and we 're going to nickname him " Big Mac . " Give us a guy named Ken Griffey Jr. , and we 'll call him " Junior . " We are not a complicated people . <P> With Big Mac and Junior closing in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a jam . Just four years ago , baseball was on strike , without a commissioner , canceling a World Series and generally running a brilliant anti-p.r. campaign for a sport that already was too long and too slow . " They 've got to address their own house , " says Fay Vincent , baseball 's last real commissioner , who was fired in 1992 by owners who wanted more control . " They 've got to market the game , move it back into the inner city , bring in blacks and Hispanics , " he says . " All this is going to take 15 years . The past five years have been basically lost . " <P> But despite all this ineptitude , baseball accidentally saved itself , with a mixture of talent and nostalgia . The geriatric sport has suddenly remembered how to tell its own story . ESPN ads feature not McGwire or the eminently marketable Griffey , but a Ty Cobb impersonator , who is oddly recognizable for a guy who has n't played a game since 1928 . <P> The old-school names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans love more than the game itself ( whisper the statistics 755 , 56 or 61 softly enough to their real fans , and eyes will glisten ) are in danger of changing . Cal Ripken Jr . sets a new record for consecutive games every time he steps onto the field . Juan Gonzalez may beat the record for RBIs that Hack Wilson set in 1930 . The Yankees threaten to win more games this year than the 1906 Cubs , who won 116 . Rookie pitcher Kerry Wood tied the record of 20 strikeouts in a game  --  and did it at age 20 . The most famous mark in sports , Roger Maris ' single-season home-run record of 61 in 1961 ( Can you see why we weep ? ) , is being attacked on three fronts : McGwire , who had 42 homers as of Saturday ( only a bit more than halfway through the season ) , has been joined by Griffey ( 39 ) and some guy named Sammy Sosa ( 36 ) . <P> Ball parks are selling so well  --  shooting for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that Bud Selig , Brewers owner and " acting " commissioner for nearly six ugly years , crawled back into daylight to crown himself " real " commissioner this month . " The fact that we were doing so well had something to do with it , definitely , " he says . When all other business plans fail , find a guy you can compare to Babe Ruth .
