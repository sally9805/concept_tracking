IN THE THREE DECADES since PSYCHOLOGY TODAY published its first issue , candor has become an increasingly scarce commodity . The words of public figures reach us now through a whirl of " spin , " a media looking glass that distorts as often as it reflects . PT 's approach is more straightforward : we have carried on conversations with the interesting and the important , and presented these conversations just as they are . You hear what we hear : voices that are skeptical or hopeful , reassuring or provocative , passionate or analytical . These voices speak on the big issues and the microscopic details , the whole world and the small universe of psychology Their number has expanded in recent years to include not only noted psychologists , but others-writers , actors , scientistswith insight into the human condition . It still comes down to questions and answers , to two people and a tape recorder . For 30 years , PT has delivered direct to its readers the voices of psychology We hope you 've enjoyed listening. - Annie Murphy Paul B.F. SKINNER PSYCHOLOGIST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle his child . I would prefer to turn child raising over to a specialist . I just ca n't believe that an ordinary parent can do a good job . What has happened in the past is that a culture has set up a routine way of handling kids . You spank them for what is wrong ; you do n't spank them for what is good ; and so on .... But we do n't have stable cultures any more , so the average parent does n't know what to do . The books on child care are more confusing than anything else because you ca n't apply what they recommend : " Go and love your child . " That would be all right , but you ca n't go and buy three ounces of love at the store . And if the child really is n't lovable , you simply have to fake it . " - September 1967 PETER DRUCKER MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT " Here I am , 58 , and I still do n't know what I am going to do when I grow up . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say that , but I am not .... Nobody tells young people that life is not that categorized . And nobody tells them that the only way to find what you want is to create a job . Nobody worth his salt has ever moved into an existing job . That 's for post-office clerks . " - March 1968 ROLL MAY PSYCHOLOGIST Photograph " I 'm 58 , and I still do n't know what I am going to do when I grow up . " - Drucker ( third from left ) with Skinner , May , and Erikson. // " The sacrament of marriage no longer has meaning in our society . People get married and they have their goddamn fingers crossed . Because , though they hope it 's going to work , nobody puts their heart into it . And life , real life , consists of throwing yourself into something . " - September 1967 JONAS SALK INVENTOR OF POLIO VACCINE " I think that mankind is suffering from a lot of symbolic autoimmune diseases , as well as from some symbolic cancers .... We seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for survival . The human mind has gone through a whole series of evolutionary stages , and at each stage it has found ways of dealing with the challenges posed by its environment . The time has arrived in which we have to realize that we are all parts of a single organism , and develop some new kinds of responses and relationships . " - March 1983 ANNA QUINDLEN NOVELIST AND FORMER NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST " The idea that we have to divide the world into what happens at home and what happens out in the orbit of the professions and of politics is specious , because I do n't think anybody lives that way ... Most of us ricochet wildly from thinking about Paula Jones to thinking about whether our kids ought to go to private or public school . I fail to see why our newspapers , in some sense , should n't reflect the way we live now . " - October 1994 ROBERT COLES PSYCHOLOGIST " We in the upper middle class have lots of substitutes for religion . The readers of PSYCHOLOGY TODAY belong to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex counselors , group therapists , authorities on the formation of T-groups encounter groups . We have a collection of secular experts who write books and tell parents at every stage of their lives , and the lives of their children , what is the correct rhythm of life . These experts give sanction to the people of the upper middle class by assuring them that if they live in a certain way then they are somehow in accord with the tenor of the times .... And then there are the theologians of the upper middle class . I 'm talking about the psychiatrists and social scientists who peddle formulas and theories and generalizations . Such is their business , and in a society that has given up on religion and philosophy but is nonetheless looking for answers , the generalizations of social science become objects of faith , guideposts , bones of contention . " - November 1975 RAY BRADBURY SCIENCE FICTION WRITER " The so-called realists are trying to drive us insane , and I refuse to be driven insane . I agree with Nietzsche , who said : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . ' That 's what art is for . In our daily lives , we are making do . Things get rougher as we go along , but we make do . We lose love ; we lose people ; we lose jobs . And the remarkable thing about the human race is the ability to survive . We survive by fantasizing . Take that away from us and the whole damned race goes down the drain . " - April 1968 OLIVER STONE FILM MAKER " I always maintain that violence in films has to be real , as real as possible . Violence is obscene when it 's fake . . .. There 's nothing worse than television violence-people die so easily on TV ! They just drop dead . If you 're going to kill somebody , show the effect of the killing . Make it powerful , make it real , so that people really understand . Violence per se is a good dramatic tool , a good theatrical diversion . It is a necessary conceit to give pity and terror . But it should be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WRIGHT EDELMAN CHILDREN 'S RIGHTS ACTIVIST " We assume that we 're a society that loves children although most parents do , society as a whole does n't . We are one of the few nations that has no family policy and children suffer from this lack . A friend told me a story that points out the disparity between how we treat children and how other countries do . A few years ago , she was in Iran during an earthquake . The Shah sent out a group to gather up children who had lost their families and their homes . They scoured the villages and came back empty-handed . The homeless children already had absorbed into the broader community . I doubt this would have happened in America . " - June 1975 ISAAC ASIMOV SCIENCE FICTION WRITER Photograph " Take fantasy away from us and the human race goes down the drain . " - Bradbury ( far right ) with Rogers , Salk , and Menninger. // " I 'm not afraid of computers taking over . I think that is a simplistic idea . I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over or automobiles are taking over . I know that some people say that if computers are brighter than we are , then they may not need us . Well , automobiles go faster than we do , so they may not need us . The mere fact of being able to think better than we can is insufficient . Think in what way ? Think how ? It is foolish to think that all manner of thought is identical . Computers are good at the manipulation of quantities , and they can do that faster than we can without error . They have always been able to . But human beings have insight , intuition , creativity-they are able to see connections that are not readily apparent . They can come up with surprisingly accurate answers from obviously incomplete information , and even the human beings themselves do n't know where the answers came from . " - January 1983 KARL MENNINGER PSYCHIATRIST " I think the spirit of the human race is constantly being elevated . That 's why I think we will give up vengeance . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil-minded , as heartless as it was just over a hundred years ago . How did a slaveowner sleep at night ? When Verdi wrote his operas , it was actually conceivable that beautiful music was appropriate to romantic stories about people whose lives were devoted to the one end of bloody vengeance . " - February 1969 BRUNO BETTELHEIM PSYCHOLOGIST Photograph " Theologians of the upper middle class " : Coles and Stone . // " Making a lot of noise is one of the oldest methods of scaring away the devil or evil . And that 's what our youngsters do : they turn on the TV and the noise drives away evil or scary thoughts .... What they are really afraid of is chaos-the chaos within that would destroy them , the chaos in the streets . " - July 1981 ART BUCHWALD HUMORIST " One of the toughest things to handle in life for someone who has had a tough life is success . That 's why so many successful people are in analysis . You 've been kicked around when you were a kid so you get used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be kicked around . To be on top is a very difficult thing-because it scares the hell out of you . You know you do n't want to be there , and your whole life has been a series of preparations for the worst . " - January 1969 ERIK ERIKSON PSYCHOLOGIST " Thirty years ago , we spoke of elders , ' the handful of wise old women and men who faced death with dignity . But a society can have only relatively few elders . So our current large group of well-preserved old people leads us to speak now of elderlies . ' The existence of this group means that we need to rethink the role of old age .... I think that the biggest change in the last stage of life would be that old people will be allowed to remain involved in matters that have always been considered too much for them . The stage of middle adulthood is the stage of generativity , and the question is , how , and how long , can old people be generative ? I 've described generativity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old people can no longer procreate , but they can be productive , and they can be creative . The creative potential of old people has been very much underestimated . " - June 1983 CARL SAGAN ASTRONOMER " I would recommend almost dying to everybody .. It 's a character-building experience . You get a much clearer perspective on what 's important . " - August 1972 CARL ROGERS PSYCHOLOGIST " One of the unfortunate things about psychology is that it tried to make one great leap and become a science like physics . We should recognize that people observed things , and thought about things , and fiddled around with things a long time before they came up with any of the precise observations which made a science out of physics . Psychologists may have to go back and do much more naturalistic observation , make more of an attempt to understand people , behavior , and the dynamics of things . Then , perhaps someday , out of that might grow a real psychological science , not an imitation of physics , a human science that should have as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much psychological experimentation is done on rats and cats is that we realize perfectly that we do n't have the tools for understanding human beings . " - December 1967 ALICE ROSSI SOCIOLOGIST " It is possible these days to have a great time , sexually speaking , without a lot of commitment . People have learned how to be in bed with each other without becoming dependent or putting intimacy on trial . But you can push this kind of thing into marriage , too , as in the rigid , spelled-out marriage contracts that some radical feminists are proposing . These contracts strike me as like the terms of employment you agree to when you go to work somewhere-like being married is just another job .... They propose to bring more of a work ethic into the home and marriage . But I would like to see us go the other way , to bring more human , humane considerations into both home and working lives . Let 's get rid of the time-clock mentality in both settings . Commitment and interdependence without loss of identity works better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLIVER SACKS NEUROLOGIST AND WRITER " I 'm eccentric . I do n't have much social life . I do n't go out much . I 'm on the shy side and I do n't entirely feel rooted or at home or that I belong anywhere . I do n't think I ever have . The term " eccentric ' means off-center , " and what I 'm interested in , both in my patients and myself , is seeing whether one can establish a different center . I think a life has to be centered , but I think it does n't have to be the same center . " - May/June 1995 .
