Donkeys laden with firewood shambled about aimlessly among the crowd in the shabby central square in Mamuras , 19 mi. north of the Albanian capital of Tirana . The townsfolk 's timeless talk about rain , marriages and hardship had given way to the excitement of an epochal event : the country 's first free elections . " We want the same things as the rest of Europe  --  freedom to go where we like , to work hard and to secure our future , " said Shaban Sula , 37 , who works on a nearby collective farm .

Earlier in March some 20,000 Albanians had scrambled aboard any boat bound for the nearest ports in Italy , and thousands more are desperate to leave . <P> Although the two major parties differ on the pace and scope of the change they hope to achieve , both say progress can come only through a market economy buttressed by massive aid from Europe and the U.S. President Ramiz Alia , head of the Party of Labor since Hoxha 's death in 1985 , made tentative moves toward reform early last year , when he pledged to break the stranglehold of party management and introduced limited price reforms .
