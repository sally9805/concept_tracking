<p> At last year 's American College of Rheumatology conference , Anergen Inc. reported what it described as promising results in early tests of its new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis . <p> But by this year 's conference , held last month , Anergen had suspended work on the drug and dismissed 65 percent of its employees because it had run out of money . On Monday , the company , based in Redwood City , Calif. , managed to keep some of its research alive by agreeing to be acquired by the Corixa Corporation , a Seattle biotechnology company , for $8.5 million in stock . <p> The biotechnology industry is facing a financial reckoning . Investors , disappointed by the financial returns the industry has provided so far , are growing more reluctant to provide the huge amounts of money young companies need to develop , test and sell new drugs . <p> The result , analysts and executives say , is that many small biotechnology companies are cutting back on research . Some are falling by the wayside or being acquired by bigger companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmaceutical companies and instead becoming , in effect , subcontractors to the big drug companies . <p> Some executives warn that the lack of capital could also slow medical innovation because the small biotechnology companies have often been pioneers , playing a crucial role in quickly moving scientific discoveries from university laboratories to the marketplace . <p> Although it is too early to say what the impact will be , biotechnology companies need to spend heavily in their efforts to develop drugs and diagnostic tests for cancer , AIDS , Alzheimer 's disease and a wide range of other conditions , as well as develop basic drug discovery techniques like gene-hunting and chemical screening . <p> The Immunex Corporation , a Seattle biotechnology company , struggled with losses for 17 years and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on research and development before finally introducing an important new drug for rheumatoid arthritis last month . But biotechnology companies just starting out might not get the same chance . <p> " What it means , unfortunately  --  even brutally  --  in some cases , is that promising areas of research will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Biotechnology Industry Organization , a trade group . <p> Some biotechnology industry executives , however , say the elimination of weaker companies will be healthy , freeing money for more deserving projects . There are simply too many biotechnology companies , they say , more than 300 publicly traded ones and about 1,000 private ones . <p> Moreover , some experts say , medical innovation will continue but more of the work will shift to academic laboratories and big drug companies . <p> Congress has vowed to double the annual budget of the National Institutes of Health the next five years from last year 's $13.6 billion . This year 's budget is already up to $15.6 billion . And big pharmaceutical companies , which at first largely ignored biotechnology , have now adopted its techniques , which involve using genetic engineering , genetics and other advanced insights into how cells operate . <p> Still , small biotechnology companies , like their counterparts in electronics and computers , can often move faster and more efficiently into new scientific areas than can big companies . <p> The biotechnology industry has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1994 . Some executives and analysts think this is just another cyclical downturn , tied to the overall volatility in the stock market this year . Indeed , biotechnology stocks have rallied with the rest of the market in recent weeks . <p> " I 've heard of gloom and doom already three or four times , " said Dr. Alain Schreiber , president of Vical Inc. , a San Diego gene therapy company . <p> But others say that investors have permanently soured on biotechnology and that the entire system by which biotechnology companies have been created and financed is breaking down . <p> " We 're trying to figure out what makes sense as a business model for this industry , " said Brian Atwood , a partner at Brentwood Venture Capital in Menlo Park , Calif . " Nobody 's figured that out yet . " <p> It is not that the technology has failed . Although it has not produced as many new drugs as early investors had anticipated , biotechnology is now bearing fruit . Ten drugs developed by biotechnology companies were approved or recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more than 280 drugs are in middle- or late-stage clinical trials . And the unraveling of the genetic code presents a cascade of opportunities . <p> The problem is the long times and huge sums required to develop these drugs . To get money , companies must sell shares to the public years before they have products or profits . The stock price can languish while the company conducts clinical trials . While some drugs succeed and investors are amply rewarded , many others fail and the stock price plummets . <p> Investors have pumped an estimated $90 billion into public biotechnology companies since 1980 , according to Vector Securities International , an investment bank specializing in health care . Yet over all , the investment has not paid off , with biotechnology stocks rising in only 7 of 16 years , according to Vector . <p> Recombinant Capital , a San Francisco consulting firm , calculated back in 1995 that an investor who put $100 into every biotechnology initial public offering since 1980 would have earned a return of only 1 percent a year . The figure would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Edwards , the managing director . <p> So investors , who once plunged into biotechnology with the same abandon now reserved for Internet stocks have become less willing to invest on a promise . <p> Stocks of the roughly 10 big biotechnology companies , which already have products and profits and market capitalization over $1 billion , have in general risen smartly this year , but the stocks of scores of smaller companies have plummeted . The 298 stocks tracked by Bioworld Financial Watch , a newsletter , are down an average 18 percent this year . <p> Privately held biotechnology companies have had difficulty going public , and public ones have not been able to sell new shares . <p> Publicly traded biotechnology companies raised $2.4 billion from investors through October , less than half the $4.9 billion raised in the corresponding period of 1997 , according to Burrill &; Company , a San Francisco merchant bank . <p> Venture capitalists , who provide seed money , are also becoming more cautious . The absolute amount of venture capital invested in biotechnology has remained steady since 1995 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to PricewaterhouseCoopers , the accounting and consulting firm . <p> Such prominent Silicon Valley venture firms as Accel Partners and Sequoia Capital have quit investing in biotechnology to focus on software and Internet companies , which do not face the same capital requirements and regulatory hurdles . Others have become more cautious about starting companies . <p> " A lot of things that were started should have stayed in a government lab or university lab , " said Sam Colella , managing partner of Institutional Venture Partners in Menlo Park . <p> He cited one of his own company 's investments  --  Athena Neurosciences Inc. , which was founded in 1986 based on an idea a professor had about Alzheimer 's disease . Athena eventually succeeded by licensing products from other companies , and it was acquired by a bigger company . But the idea on which the company was founded has not led to a drug . <p> " Athena 's original premise would not get a dollar of venture capital today , " Mr. Colella said . " I 'm going to find things that are close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many start-ups have been companies that provided research tools or services like gene-hunting or chemical screening to the big drug companies . These companies can become profitable far more quickly than those trying to develop drugs , though there is some question about how big they can ultimately become . <p> One big source of financing that is growing is from big drug companies . Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. of San Diego raised $380 million from corporate partners , while its three public stock offerings have yielded just $107 million . <p> The big companies sometimes find it quicker and less expensive to license a drug or technology from a biotechnology company than to develop it on their own . So the biotechnology companies are becoming suppliers to the big pharmaceutical companies , much as auto parts companies supply Detroit , said Mr. Edwards of Recombinant Capital . <p> But to get cash , biotechnology companies often must give up the rights to sell the products they develop , accepting royalty payments instead . That cuts into potential future profits and can further discourage investors . <p> The big drug companies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials . So for earlier-stage biotechnology companies , the outlook remains bleak . More than 50 of the 345 publicly traded biotechnology companies tracked by Vector Securities will run out of cash within a year if they continue spending at their current rates and are unable to raise new money . <p> " There will be some kind of Darwinist mechanism going on here , " said Franklin Berger , an analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities . " This is the year we 'll see a final winnowing out among the biotech companies . " <p> For example , Cellpro Inc. of Bothell , Wash. , said in September that it would liquidate because it did not have enough money to pay damages after losing a patent infringement suit . <p> The Biofield Corporation , an Atlanta company developing a noninvasive way to detect breast cancer , said last month that it had eliminated substantially all of its operations and was now trying to license or sell its technology . LXR Biotechnology Inc. of Richmond , Calif. , said in October that it would concentrate on three key programs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system for studying genes and molecules . <p> And Celtrix Pharmaceuticals Inc. laid off 90 percent of its work force , mostly in manufacturing , in September . That cut the company 's " burn rate "  --  the amount of money it loses each year - from $13 million to $2 million . The Santa Clara , Calif. , company now has only about 10 employees , who are trying to push the company 's main drug through clinical trials . <p> Some analysts say companies will be forced into mergers . " The solution is either M &; A or B  --  bankruptcy , " the chairman of Vector Securities , D. Theodore Berghorst , told biotechnology executives at a recent conference in San Diego run by Biocom , a trade group . <p> The Megabios Corporation and Genemedicine Inc. , two gene therapy companies , recently agreed to merge . " It gets tougher and tougher to say there will be new investors stepping up to the plate , " said Richard A. Waldron , Genemedicine 's chief financial officer . <p> But a wave of mergers has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to materialize . Some companies are selling stock in private placements or issuing preferred stock at prices that dilute existing shareholders . Some are trying to raise money in Europe , where investors seem more receptive than in the United States . <p> For all the worries , some executives remain confident that medical innovations will still receive financing . " We know ultimately science will win , " said Howard C. Birndorf , chairman of Nanogen Inc. , based in San Diego . " These products will help people , and there will be markets for them . " <p> " Failing the Litmus Test " Outside investors , disappointed by the weak financial returns of many biotechnology ventures , are increasingly reluctant to privide the money for start-up companies to develop , test and sell new drugs .
