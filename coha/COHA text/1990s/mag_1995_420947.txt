Living with a car in snow  --  caring for it , driving it  --  is different than living with a car in balmy climes or summer months . Here are some commonly asked questions about those differences , and the answers . Q : I 've always heard that you can get better traction on ice by letting some air out of the tires . Now I 'm told that 's no longer true . What changed ? A : Nothing changed . But now we have a better understanding of what actually happens when a tire is underinflated . An underinflated tire might look fatter where it meets the road , so you might assume that more of it is contacting the road 's surface and thus improving traction , but the fact is that the tire has gone concave where it meets the road , actually lifting much of the tread from the pavement . In a cross section , the tire would look a little like a catamaran . Instead of letting a lot of air out of the tire , just make sure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see your owner 's manual ) to maximize the size of the contact patch . Q : When I go skiing , I usually drive long stretches on dry roads before I get to the mountains ; but when I get there , I often encounter heavy snow and roads that require tire chains . What are the relative merits of front-wheel drive , rear-wheel drive , and four-wheel drive ? A : My choice in those circumstances would be a four-wheel-drive ( 4WD ) system , especially one that is full-time ( sometimes called all-wheel drive or AWD ) . An all-wheel-drive car is at home on both dry pavement and slippery surfaces , and you do n't have to fuss with chains . Many carlike sport-utility vehicles fill the bill , such as the new Oldsmobile Bravada , the Jeep Grand Cherokee , and the all-new Nissan Pathfinder . And cars with AWD , such as the Subaru Legacy and the Audi Quattro series , are also sure-footed and pleasant on long trips . You can even opt for AWD in some minivans , like the Chrysler Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ configuration for snowy and slippery roads . Front-wheel-drive cars are also less expensive to buy and maintain than four-wheel-drive machines . ( The premium for 4WD is about $2,000 . ) But you 'll need chains for those chains-required days . I know people running around the San Francisco Bay area in 4x4s and all-wheel-drive cars just because they do n't want to cope with the annoyance of chains on the two or three winter trips they make to the Sierra . A front-wheel-drive car also has inherent understeer , which means  --  among other things  --  if it goes off the road , it is more apt to go off frontward than backward . A rear-wheel drive tends to oversteer , which means it 's more apt to go off backward . If you must go off the road , headfirst is preferred way to go , because you can at least see where you are going and have a better chance at selecting a path for your off-road excursion than if you are going backward . One disadvantage of front-wheel drive in ski country is when you 're climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to displace most of the vehicle 's weight to the rear , away from the drive wheels , then traction can be seriously diminished . People who need to climb very steep hills in front-wheel-drive vehicles get good at backing up hills . Taking hills in reverse puts the car 's weight back over the drive wheels . For people looking for a powerful car primarily for driving on dry pavement , rear-wheel drive is still the preferred configuration . One reason is that too much a power applied to front-wheel drives can create what is known as " torque steer . " ( That 's when you press hard on the accelerator and the front wheels seem to be having a race with each other . ) Around 200 it horsepower seems to be the critical point . If you want a powerful rear-driver , but you plan to take it skiing sometimes , make certain it has a traction control system . And you 'll still need chains to comply with chains-required regulations , so make certain it has enough clearance under the fenders to take chains . Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in snow , but now I live where there 's a lot of stop-and-go commuting , and constant shifting is a drag . Any suggestions ? A : Manual gear shifts with their greater control for slippery starts ( always start off in the highest gear possible to limit wheel spin ) have been equaled now by some automatic transmissions that start of in what amounts to second , unless you many ually move the lever to low . You 'll find this in models from Mercedes-Benz , Volvo , Saab , and Subaru , to name a few . ( Drivers who like to burn rubber do n't like this feature , but they do have the option of downshifting . ) And now the Eagle Vision TSi ( and soon other Chrysler Corporation cars ) has one of the niftiest gearshifts in cardom for those who want the advantages of both a manual and an automatic transmission . It 's called " AutoStick , " and it offers the option of driving with a conventional automatic shift or-with a sides ways tap of the console-mounted lever  --  an effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like crawling traffic mixed with some twisty roads at either end , or lowlanders with icy mountain weekends-would do well to look into AutoStick . Q : I keep hearing that an antilock braking if system ( ABS ) is not good in snow . What 's the story ? A : An antilock braking system works this way : Electronic sensors monitor a car 's wheels , and when they detect the incipient locking of a wheel under braking ( a slippery road is one place where it 's particularly easy to lock your wheels when braking ) , the brakes pulse automatically so that the wheel can keep rolling . ( Only a rolling wheel can answer a steering wheel 's instructions and thus turn . ) We were once taught to , more or less , do this ourselves . It was called pumping the brakes . But with ABS the electronics do the pumping , and do it so much faster ( six to 14 times a second ) , and are so much more sensitive to when the wheels are approaching lockup that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now comes the catch : ABS ca n't alter its mode of braking to fit different circumstances like a human driver can . And in deeper snow  --  say four or more inches of new snow or the chopped-up kind you might find in a ski-area parking lot  --  locking up the wheels actually leads to a shorter stop . That little mounding of snow that builds up in front of the locked wheels can be obstacle enough to slow the car more quickly . But since ABS is designed to prevent that locking up , the wheels do n't lock but roll over the buildup , and the car continues moving . Stopping in these circumstances in an ABS car can take half again as long as a car with regular brakes . What to do ? Well , the problem seems to be a problem mostly to skiers . So , be aware of the limitations of ABS in snowy situations ( deep gravel has similar characteristics ) . In places such as a parking lot , where you can not nimbly dodge around trouble as you brake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull into your path . You can T-bone them all too easily if you are not moving slowly enough . Q : Can carrying bags of sand or cement blocks in the trunk increase traction ? A : Bags of sand have one true advantage : You can use the contents to sprinkle over an icy track . And , yes , added weight over the wheels of a rear-wheel-drive car can improve traction . But added weight can also add to handling problems by disrupting a car 's balance , making a car more likely to spin if it begins to fishtail on a slick road . Added weight also costs more at the gas pump . Q : What 's the best way to get out of a ditch ? A : Besides not getting into it in the first place , the best way out is back the way you came . Your miscreant vehicle has already made a path of sorts , so if someone is going to pull you out with a tow chain , it is usually easier to pull you back along that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way by shoveling out built-up snow and leveling the center of the path to limit resistance on the way out . Dig out any snow that keeps you from straightening your wheels . Be sure that you attach the tow chain to the frame rather than a bumper or a body part that might get towed free rather than the whole car . Get in the car , start it , put it in reverse , and give it a little gas , but do n't spin your wheels . If there is no tow vehicle , then hand labor will have to do . The secret is in preparation , preparation , preparation  --  which can mean lots of digging and maybe some jacking up to put rocks , sand , or other traction material ( car carpets turned upside down for instance ) under the drive wheels . Of course , you carry a de-ditching tool with you  --  a handy little shovel . And you have a tow chain , too , just in case you need it . Not long ago , shifting between reverse and drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aft again ( along with a great shove by helpful passerbys ) was a relatively easy way to get unstuck , even with an automatic transmission . But if you 're driving a late-model car , you can shift gears only when you step on the brake pedal . This , obviously , hinders your ability to shift quickly . But what 's worse , with the brakes engaged , the car loses momentum , defeating the whole procedure . Going off the road is such a drag it can ruin an otherwise glorious ski trip , so take the road conditions into account and take precautions to stay on the road . And if you have a four-wheel-drive vehicle , keep in mind that its greater ability to get underway on slippery surfaces is n't matched with a greater ability to stop . It might even be less adept in the turns than a car . Sometimes with four-wheel drive you can get back on the road more easily than you can with two-wheel drive , but that 's still not the sort of off-road the makers had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be the wheels getting a bite , unless your four-wheel-drive machine is equipped with a limited-slip differential ( which transfers power from a spinning wheel to the opposite wheel on that axle ) or a locking differential ( which transmits power equally to both wheels on the drive axle ) . Plus you run the risk of getting high-centered ( your spinning wheels dig in so deeply that the car 's low-hanging under-parts rest firmly on snow , suspending your tires off the ground ) . Without locking ( or to a degree , limited-slip ) differentials , four-wheel drive is really two-wheel drive , one wheel on each axle . And two-wheel drive is actually one-wheel drive . Q : What 's this about using neutral when turning or braking on ice ? Do n't I want the engine helping with that ? A : In a word , no . Turning or braking forces are distributed more evenly to all the wheels when you declutch ( with a manual transmission ) or slip into neutral ( with an automatic ) . This is something taught at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be believed . So try it . What you are doing is unhooking the engine from the wheels , leaving them to respond only to cornering and braking forces . Q : Are n't snow tires the way to go when you really need good traction in winter ? A : Yes and no . Tire compounds and tread patterns are extremely important for traction . However , understand that today 's all-season radials , the ones that take you to the beach in quiet and comfort in the summer , can do a better job of getting you through snow and ice than the snow tires of even 10 years ago . If your needs are extreme ( you live on a back road in ski country ) or if you use high-performance summer tires on your high-performance car , then you are better off with a special tire for winter , too . If you have the space to store them ( and the budget to buy them the ideal is to have a separate set of wheels on which to mount your winter tires . Then it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . Otherwise , most people and most cars can quite satisfactorily enjoy a ski season without a change of rubber . Just be sure your tires are all-season with MS ( mud and snow ) capability . Q : My car sits outside in the winter . Do you have any suggestions for getting snow off it after a heavy fall A : Brooms are a bust  --  too flexible for pushing , and they scratch . A new gadget spotted in the Herrington catalog is just the thing for pushing major pileups off hoods ; car tops , and trunk decks . Called Sno Brum , it has a nonabrasive. foam-plastic head , 17 inches wide and six inches high , attached at right angles to a three-foot broom handle . Use it as a mini snowplow and shove away . It costs $20 . Call 800-903-2878 for a Herrington catalog . Being New Hampshire-based , the company has other handy stuff for living with a car in the snow , such as folding shovels , traction claws , and heating pads for your car seats . Q : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's not used to driving on ice ? A : Do n't ski where I do . Seriously , here 's the most important thing to remember : Treat your brakes as if they released poison when pressed . In a way , they do . And maybe one more thing : Gently does it . Be quick to assess a situation , and whatever you do  --  steer , brake , accelerate  --  do it with downright tenderness . It 's the rough , sudden movements that upset a car . <p>
