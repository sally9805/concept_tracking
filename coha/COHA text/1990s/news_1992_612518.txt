<p> Shiloh took the team title at the Gwinnett-Cobb track challenge Saturday , helping Gwinnett County win the meet at Emory University . The Generals outscored second-place South Cobb 107 to 99 in a meet that prepared all the teams for the region finals and produced some top performances in the process . <p> Shiloh won the inaugural event without winning any individual or relay event . The Generals did have two people or two relay teams place in five different events and placed three people in the 200-and 800-meter runs . <p> " Since it 's the first one it makes it even nicer , " said Shiloh coach Jimmy Jarrett . " After county where Shiloh finished fourth these kids were down , but this is a team that has come up off the deck . " <p> Chris Jones ( 100 ) , Heath Icenogle ( 110 hurdles ) , Deon Sanders ( long jump ) , Chris Reynolds ( 300 hurdles ) and Craig Knotts ( two-mile ) all garnered third places to pace Shiloh . The Generals took home the team trophy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools ' 452-269 win over the three Cobb County schools . <p> " This is what I wanted , good competition late in the year and a lot of good times , " said Brookwood coach and meet organizer Jerry Arnold . " If we want to improve , we 've got to take on good teams and see how much work we have to do . " <p> North Gwinnett 's Jeremy Geigle got the meet started on a good note when he cleared a season-high 15 feet to win the pole vault . The action then got fast on the track in the second race of the day . <p> Parkview 's Jeremy Hauch fought Pope 's Andy Burns hard in the mile , sprinting the final lap with the cross-country state champ before succumbing by less than a second . The competition brought Hauch home in a personal best 4:16.99 , breaking the school record by five seconds . Hauch later won the two-mile . <p> Juan Daniels of Norcross was the only double winner from Gwinnett in the meet . The senior won the triple jump ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but his teaching skills may have cost him in the 110 high hurdles . <p> That 's where teammate Stanley Jones took the win in 15.19 seconds . Jones also finished second in the 300 hurdles and credited Daniels with his improvement . <p> " I 've improved on my technique quite a bit from watching Juan race , " Jones said . " This is my first win against him and it helps my confidence a lot . " <p> Other Gwinnett winners were sophomore Robert Little of Meadowcreek in the shot put ( 46-9 1/4 ) , Parkview 's Brandon Pendley in the 800 ( 2:01.4 ) and senior Justin Zack of Brookwood in the high jump ( 6-6 ) . It was the second straight week Zack has claimed an invitational title ; he won the Westminster Relays the previous week . <p> With most teams taking a breather this week , the competition was the forerunner to next week 's region meet . The meet provided some stiff competition , and Arnold hopes that will encourage more Cobb schools to participate next year . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Cobb 99 , 3 . Norcross 92 , 4 .
