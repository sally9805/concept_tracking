It was a storybook debut . In 1988 the Metropolitan Opera needed a last-minute replacement for Kathleen Battle in L'Elisir d'Amore . It turned to an apprentice in its young-artists program named Dawn Upshaw . The audience cheered , and the critics raved about Upshaw 's charm and freshness ; she seemed set for a predictable rise in the soubrette roles of grand opera . But Upshaw had ideas of her own . A few years earlier , one of her voice teachers , Jan DeGaetani , had told her to " seek your own path . " Upshaw took that advice . From Mozart to Stravinsky to show tunes , she sings a far wider range of music than is typical for an international star , yet at 34 she has risen faster and further than any other American singer of her generation . <P> From the moment of the Met triumph , Upshaw made it clear she intended to be a singer first , a diva second . She had performed in only a few operas and had barely established a recital career when she produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she sang Samuel Barber 's Knoxville : Summer of 1915 and compositions by Menotti , Stravinsky and John Harbison . The other , which came out two years later , is called The Girl with Orange Lips and is a collection of highly unusual contemporary pieces . Both won Grammys . Her next album , the Symphony No. 3 by Polish composer Henryk Gorecki , on which she was the soloist , became the most unexpected classical crossover hit of all time , landing on the British pop charts in 1993 . Now Upshaw has another unlikely triumph on her hands : a new album called I Wish It So , which consists of mostly unfamiliar theater songs by Kurt Weill , Marc Blitzstein , Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim . <P> Few opera singers have ever seemed so convincing  --  and comfortable  --  in the Broadway idiom . Upshaw begins with four songs of yearning for love : the album 's title number , taken from Blitzstein 's 1959 Juno ; There Wo n't Be Trumpets , a song dropped from Sondheim 's short-lived 1964 show Anyone Can Whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unproduced Sondheim musical of 1954 , ! Saturday Night ; and That 's Him , from Weill and Ogden Nash 's 1943 One Touch of Venus . Accompanied alternately by small ensembles and an orchestra , Upshaw stakes her claim as theater music 's most luminous ingenue since Barbara Cook  --  vulnerable yet resolute , urgently soaring yet as down-to-earth as the girl next door . <P> In the remainder of the album , Upshaw reveals that she is equally at home in less sentimental moods , skillfully handling , for example , the cynical extravagance of Bernstein 's Glitter and Be Gay ( from Candide ) . Only in I Feel Pretty , from West Side Story , does she seem outside the song , pushing its innocence too hard . Otherwise , she conveys what the best singers have always strived for : the sense that a song springs directly from mysterious promptings within her .
