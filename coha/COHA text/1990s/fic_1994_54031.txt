Section : FICTION In the dream , I arrive at an airbase somewhere twenty years after having flown an airplane . I have long forgotten procedures and instrument markings that I once knew by heart . The problem in the dream is that I 'm scheduled to fly at say 8:30 A.M. It 's about 7:45 , I 've got my checklist in hand , and I 'm out at the flight line looking for the aircraft I 'm supposed to fly , wondering if I 've really forgotten what I used to know . Other airplanes are flying in and out of the field , other pilots , some of my old pilot buddies are there  --  Hood , Wright , Bossert . It may be a training mission coming up . I 'm not sure . It may be a combat mission . I find my aircraft  --  I think this is the right one  --  I get in the cockpit , and I fumble and worry and postpone and try to add numbers which do not add up . Most of the time I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . <p> In about one dream out of five , the friend I lost in the war , Lew Bishop , comes and stands nearby on the ground and tries to talk to me as I sit up in the cockpit going through my checklist over and over . <p> Back when I really stepped off the transport plane upon arrival in Vietnam , 1970 , October , I saw white craters right up there on those green mountains , where the enemy was , I imagined . I remember thinking  --  walking across the flight line  --  that enemy troops could be right out there beyond that chain-link fence at that moment . I remember feeling ashamed of my fear . <p> A few days later , I went on to Clark Air Base in the Philippines for jungle survival training . I felt relieved . We 'd heard that this last bit of training before actual combat was fun . We did n't doubt that we 'd have a good time in the war  --  it would be the adventure of our lives of course  --  but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of anxiety that would surely be a part of combat duty . And we would n't be flying during jungle survival training there in the Philippines , so we could drink all night if we wanted to , except when we were in the jungle , and even then , the time in the jungle , would be a kind of lark . <p> I remember saying  --  before I left the States that year  --  " I 'll be flying combat missions out of Thailand , over the Ho Chi Minh Trail , but first I 'll be in the Philippines for six weeks for jungle survival training . " " The Philippines " had that warrior sound to it . <p> I do n't remember much about the actual training course . I do remember a packet of cards we got  --  about the size of a set of playing cards , each with a picture of a jungle plant , and on the back of each card was a list of facts about the plant : edible , yes or no , etcetera . Since we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippines except maids and whores , we played up to each other by getting drunk and throwing parties on the weekends . <p> I met Lew at a party at someone 's house , someone who was stationed there in the Philippines , and when I got to the house , out front , up and down the street , an armed guard walked patrol . I do n't mean a military person , I mean a privately hired Filipino with a shotgun , working for the neighborhood . Something about thugs and a mafia and a bunch of communists being loose , running around the countryside . <p> I knew back then that I 'd have my hands full of communists in due time . Now was the time to relax . <p> Some of the married guys had their families at Clark , and wives had brought babies to this party , and one of the babies was the biggest baby I 'd ever seen , crawling around on a blanket , with this big head and big body . A five-month-old with the body of a three-year-old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late-afternoon under shade trees in a fenced-in backyard . The baby kept crawling off the blanket , and everybody was bound to have been thinking , That 's the biggest baby I 've ever seen , but nobody would say anything because the mother and daddy were sitting there , proud , and having seen the baby every day of its life and with no other to compare it to , were probably unaware of its extraordinary size . I was n't married . I always dismissed the idea of a fighter pilot with a family as incongruous . <p> Out of the house and across the grass walked this guy I 'd never seen before . He was wearing a flight suit . He reminded me of something . I was n't sure exactly what , then I had it  --  a vulture : no butt , stooped shoulders , loose-jointed , long neck , big nose , cowlick in the top back of his head , hair sticking every which way . It was Lew . <p> He looked at the baby , took a swig of beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead quiet , " That 's the biggest baby I ever seen in my life . " <p> Later on that night we started telling stories , mostly the two of us  --  Lew and me  --  while others listened . He was from Alabama , and he would listen as well as talk , and we both had some good stories . When I left the party I was looking forward to seeing him again . And it so happened that Lew and I were both going to be stationed at Nakom Phanom , in Thailand , flying the OV-10 , a forward air control airplane that was new in Southeast Asia . <p> Our choices had been either Vietnam or Thailand . The mission out of Thailand , over Laos , was more dangerous . But the home base would be much more comfortable , much more like stateside . Anyway , I knew , secretly  --  each of us knew the same thing  --  that I would not be one of the marked ones . Because every flight , combat or not , was destined to be safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stick in your hand , your feet on the rudder pedals , your hand on the throttle , America in your heart , God on your side . Through earphones , you listened to yourself breathe into the tiny microphone at your lips , and there in front of you were all those familiar instruments that had always been there , looking the very same on each flight , very reliable , sophisticated instruments , each with a personality almost . They 'd been designed  --  all the systems , engines , instruments  --  by top-dollar American companies , strong-sounding companies : McDonnell Douglass , American Rockwell . You enjoyed repeating to your buddies back home , when you were there on leave : " It 's got two American Rockwell engines  --  seven hundred and fifteen horsepower per engine . " <p> No , the dangerous , truly dangerous and risky flights were those from the night before , or early morning before , or day before , or they were the flights someone else , always someone else , got killed on . The safe sortie was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one you were taxiing out to takeoff for . <p> Taxiing out was part of the great fun of it . <p> People looking at you  --  hell , you were still a king if no one was looking because you were looking at yourself , admiring yourself in the rearview mirror right up there in front of you  --  one of those flashy wrap-around mirrors . You might even have your sun visor pulled down out of your helmet  --  an air warrior . <p> Out to the left would be two Roman chariots , painted in deep reds and golds , each pulled by two prancing powerful muscular horses . And on the right , for me  --  and this was different for each of us  --  for me there was Roy Rogers . This is not funny . He was riding Trigger , and he would look at me , tip his hat . Each time I looked at him , he would look at me and tip his hat . <p> Once  --  in the war  --  I was flying back from the Trail after my main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fuel permitting , to strafe a thicket of trees in which I was told a donkey and some people and supplies were hidden away . Enemy . I made four passes before I reached low fuel . I could never afterward imagine the people and the donkey either dead or alive . Sometimes I think maybe I have dreamed this and it did n't happen . But I know it did happen . <p> Back in the Philippines before the war , I had discovered Lew 's dry sense of humor . But Lew himself was not dry at all . He was wet some-how  --  that 's even the way his hair always looked , like he 'd just been swimming , wet and sticking up in back . <p> One weekend we got a pass there in the Philippines and went to this little resort area . This was the only weekend of the six that we were allowed off base . It was just Lew and me , and the first night it was raining hard . It had been raining for a week  --  everybody had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the weekend we had the pass , and we were there at this little resort area . We 'd been sitting around the hotel all afternoon hoping it would stop raining so we could get out on the beach , or get out somewhere , but it did n't stop , and so that night we were sitting at the hotel bar in a booth , and we 'd had just enough to drink to be a little punchy . The booth was alongside a wall , and set into that wall like a small window was a lighted aquarium with two or three big dull fish swimming around . Until you looked directly at the aquarium , you had the feeling you were sitting at a window . We 'd had a few beers , and there was a lull in the conversation . Then Lew nodded toward the fish and said , " This rain is getting ridiculous . " I looked at those fish staring in from the outside , opening and closing their mouths , and I laughed a little I think . Those fish had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I laughed again . It was getting funnier . <p> Lew was sitting there across the table , his face straight , sober . Then he looked at the fish , and he could n't hold it back , so he started laughing too , and it was one of those times  --  you know what I 'm talking about . You get the absolute sillies , and it 's like being in heaven in a way . I was lying on the bench in that booth laughing as hard as I ever have in my life , and every time I rose up , I 'd look at those fish giving it the ho-hum  --  open mouth , close mouth  --  and I 'd be back on my side . <p> None of us , of course , would have stepped in front of an Asian to stop a bullet . My great-grandfather , who fought at Vicksburg and died there , felt differently about his war . I know all about it . I remember it . All wars present occasion for different categories of courage . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my war , Lew and I were flying formation , specifically not allowed , but we met and flew in formation anyway at the end of our missions if we were scheduled to fly at the same time in adjacent sectors . <p> We were in a left bank , about sixty kilometers south of Miguia Pass , when Lew 's nose dipped funny  --  a quick pitch down , then up  --  and at the same time I saw out of the corner of my eye something tear loose from the tail end of his aircraft . <p> We 're walking down this alley in town , just off base , a few nights before . We 're drunk . This is Lew 's idea . He knows about it and where it is . All of a sudden he turns down this little bitty alley . These pigpens with plywood and wire siding are all over the place . Then there 's this prostitute , shiny dress tight , red lips , white-yellow face . " Go Navy , " she says . <p> " Fuck you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , and turns to go inside . <p> They had these tiny rooms with little dressers and narrow beds and little dolls around . <p> " I think I 'm hit , " says Lew over his radio . <p> " I 'll drop back and check it out , " I said . I pulled back on my power . He was out to my left . When I was behind him , I saw that his left elevator was gone . <p> " I ca n't control it , " he said . <p> " You 'll have to punch , Lew . Your left elevator is gone . " My heart was racing , and I could n't get my breath . His aircraft was starting a slow roll to the left . I dropped back farther . <p> " I 'm punching , " he said . He was trailing smoke . <p> " Get out . Now . It might blow . " I moved out wide . <p> " I 'm punching , " he said . <p> He shot out of his aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I called on my radio for Search and Rescue . They would take at least forty-five minutes to get there . I started a hard bank to the left , over his plane , which was going down now , inverted . I had my eye on him , a dot almost , and then his parachute blossomed bright white and orange , and as I circled back he was not far below me and almost sitting still , as if the green jungle were drifting along-moving  --  below him . His parachute was like a hot-air balloon out over some green North Carolina woods . Then there was the flash of his plane exploding into a low mountain about thirty kilometers east . Black smoke boiling up . <p> Old Lew . The Mustard Man . He would put mustard on his head and jump off the bar so that his head hit the ceiling and left a yellow spot . Two-ten , the bartender , would always laugh , put his hand over his rotten teeth and say , Lieutenant James , you break your neck next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He was pulling his radio out of his vest up there in the sky when I flew past him as slowly as I could , but not too close . They were firing from below like nobody 's business now , smelling blood . Black-and-white flak bursts . They were firing their thirty-sevens , fifty-sevens , and eighty-fives from positions south of the cloud cover . He was going to land in the jungle to the east of the Trail . The only problem was the cloud cover under him . I would n't be able to see where he landed . <p> Lew turns onto this path which leads into a courtyard about the size of a room . Three Thais are squatting around this little outdoor cooker . It smells good . Behind that is the smell of pigs , pig slop , mud , standing muddy water . <p> " Papa San , " says Lew . Or whatever he said . <p> " Ah so , Ah so , " says Papa San . They all stand . <p> " Movies , " says Lew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth . Then through my earphones I heard him say , " Which way is a safe area ? " <p> I knew there were no safe areas where we were . " To the east , " I said . " The way you 're drifting . Behind you . Steer it toward the sun as much as you can . " That would get him away from the Trail as far as possible . But it was morning , and they 'd have all day to find him . <p> He went in . Right through that low white cloud cover . The shooting stopped . I got out my map , checked my position . The highest elevation in the quadrant was 3,400 feet  --  a mountaintop . That meant I could drop down into the clouds , and then if I was n't under them by 3,600 feet I 'd have to climb back out . But if I broke out in the clear beneath the clouds I could perhaps find him , mentally mark his spot , and then show that to the Search and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going for him , I could fight them off with strafing and smoke rockets . <p> It would take him a minute to pull in his parachute . I might be able to spot that . Or he could hear me and direct me to his position with his compass . But they would be shooting at me . The area below was highly defended . We were n't supposed to get below 4,500 feet above the surface anywhere out there . I 'd be below the clouds , a few hundred feet above the surface . I started down . It was automatic . I made no decisions . I went into the clouds , dropping down in a wide circle , carrying about a twenty-degree bank , hoping he was somewhere on the ground inside the circle I was flying , that I would see him once I broke out below the clouds and be able to do something for him . In the clouds , everything whited out . I got on instruments . 4,600 ; 4,500 ; 44 ; 43 ; 42 . At 36 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head back up if I was n't clear of the clouds . <p> " Ah so , Ah so . " He bows , fingertips together , you know . " One minute , one minute , " he says . <p> There 's a door in each wall of the little courtyard . Papa San opens a door to one of the rooms , claps his hands , and says something loudly . <p> Six or seven little kids walk outside , slowly , one at a time . They 've been asleep . They 're in sleeping clothes . One rubs her eyes with her knuckles . <p> 40 ; 39 ; 3,800 feet . I broke clear . There , just under me , were trees . It was almost as if I could see individual leaves and needles , some kind of fir , the patterns of bark . I 'd never been anywhere near that low over Laos . I looked hard , nothing but trees , some broken  --  but no trail , no bomb craters . Big broken trees , mountains , is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding me close to the ground . Enemy ground . I was in a valley , between mountains . Suddenly I saw a line of six donkeys walking along a narrow trail ahead of me and then flashing under my nose . They were tied together with a rope that passed one to the next and on down the line . They were walking with their heads swinging low . Leading them was a woman in a long white dress , and I recognized her as the same woman who , when I was five years old , lying on the ground on the side of the well house away from my mother 's kitchen window , had knelt beside me  --  I had been wounded in battle  --  and bathed my brow with a soft damp cloth . <p> I pressed the mike button on the throttle with my thumb and spoke into the microphone at my mouth . " Fox Six , Fox Six , this is Fox Two . I 'm down here looking . How do you read ? How do you read ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd covered a lot of ground even though I was flying slow , looking . I opened the throttle , headed back into the clouds . I knew I was not close to him , that at least one mountain was between us . Then , as I climbed in the clouds , he was on the radio , talking to me from the ground  --  coming in clear . " Fox Two , this is Fox Six , " he says . " How do you read ? " I tried to keep my voice calm and pitched as low as I could . " Loud and clear , " I said . " Pull in your parachute , bury it if you can . Hide . Turn off your radio when you 're finished . You got a good radio . I can hear you clear . Did you hear my engine ? " <p> " That 's affirmative , but then I lost it . It was up high , then I lost it . I think it might have been west . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've launched the Search and Rescue , " I said . " They 'll be right here . We 'll get you out . " <p> The man leads us into the room . He kicks the sleeping mats and blankets over into a corner . " Have seat , " he says . <p> I was still in the clouds , climbing . A bat fluttered from behind me and landed on my instrument panel , just above my altimeter . It was holding on somehow , almost hanging . It turned its head so I could see its shining eyes and said , " This is what you 've been waiting for . It 's here . This is what you 've been waiting for . And it 's not happening to you . It 's happening to him . " <p> " I think my back 's broke , " says Lew . <p> I could n't tell how far the cloud bank , clearly moving south , had blown over him . The mountain ranges all ran east-west , and the only way I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a valley to the east or west of the cloud bank and run up it , looking for him . <p> We sit on the floor . The man opens a cardboard box and lifts out a super-8 movie camera . He turns out the overhead light , clicks a switch on the projector . The black-and-white film shows a woman walk into a room where there 's a couch . She looks around . The light from the projector is strobing off the ceiling of the little room where we sit . The woman is wearing a long white robe . She takes it off slowly and throws it over the back of the couch . She is naked . She sits on the couch and rubs her breasts slowly , each hand moving in a circle . A close-up of her face . <p> I flew up a valley at about three hundred feet . Nothing . No radio contact . I climbed up and got him on the radio again . I asked if he could hear my engine , which direction I 'd been from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was saying . I picked a different valley and flew up it . I climbed up through the clouds again . I had enough fuel for one more pass . I picked another valley , flew down that . Nothing . <p> She wets her lips . Now a long shot . She looks off camera . The projector in the small room is clicking along . We , the pilots , shuffle our butts  --  we 're sitting on the floor  --  and we get settled in . Somebody lights a cigarette . The woman gets down on her hands and knees in front of the couch and looks behind her . A pig walks on screen from behind her and sniffs at her butt , which she wiggles back and forth . Close-up of her face . She licks her lips . <p> I got radio contact . I heard him very clearly . He had to be right below me . But I was above the clouds . <p> " I can hear them , " said Lew . " Goddamn , I broke my back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I was at 9,000 feet , level . Way up there , high . <p> The pig mounts her . She 's licking her lips and looking back . The projector purrs along , well-oiled . There is a close-up of the pig 's erect penis  --  it curls like a stretched-out bedspring . <p> Lew whispers , saying , " I can hear them coming . I can hear them talking . " <p> " Hide , Lew , " I say . " Hide . " <p> I hear through my earphones the tat , tat , rat , tat , tat-tat of the guns shooting old Lew . He screams over his radio : " I 'm hit . I 'm hit . Keith . I 'm hit . " He is screaming , and his voice is like a squealing rabbit in a cage . The rat , tat-tat , like little toy guns , sounding far away through the earphones tight to my ears . He 's holding down the transmit button while he dies . <p> And I am way up there above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they asked me if I wanted a Silver Star , and since I 'd never thought I would ever get more than a Distinguished Flying Cross , and since I liked the way a DFC looked , I wrote myself up for one of those and got it back in the States . Because so many of us were awarded DFCs , there was no ceremony . <p> I have wondered if maybe Lew became numb for that instant before all stopped on earth . But then I knew that if he was numb , he was numb in his body only , not in his head and heart , because those screams  --  Lew 's last sounds on earth  --  were full of the smells of death , of urine , bedsores , gangrene , the smells lifted up into the air from the sheets and soft damp pads of a bed as the fresh corpse is lifted and taken away . <p> I 've thought about Lew , the film , the rabbit in the cage , and in the dream he 's in , he 's standing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my checklist  --  and while I ca n't understand a word he 's saying , the Plexiglas canopy at the spot through which I see his face begins to magnify his face  --  larger and larger it looms , old Lew  --  as I try to add numbers which do n't add up . If I get the numbers right , his face will stop getting larger , but I never get the numbers right , and his face brings a pain and fear that is so dreadful I go sleepless . And so I tried burning myself to let burn pain capture the night pain of the dream . I tried a new job , a new place to live , a new wife , and then , a while back , I did the only thing left to do . <p> I became a woman . <p> I sit in bed , my back against pillows , powerless , cradling my full breasts in my hands , sensing their weight , waiting for my child to come . I cradle my extended belly , then smooth over it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm at the base of my middle finger , and as it rides over my expanded belly it gives streaks of chills up my back . I smooth over my mound of Venus , where no things lie soft and warm , where nothing stands stiff . I wait for my child to be born . Her name is Lou , and I love her . I will live to scream at her deep in the middle of the night because she will not stop crying . I will scream at her , and the scream will bring panic into her eyes , but I will not strike her , and months later , at the end of the first day she and I are sick together all day long with the flu , I will sit and cry while she cries out from another room . I will do this with Lou . <p> The father works . He is powerful out in the field . <p> I lie alone on my back and push and push , and bring my hand to my neck onto the pulsing ropes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two hours my memory strives to discard , finally out into the world  --  and once I do that , I may no longer have the dreams about being somewhere on an air base , sitting in a cockpit , going over the checklist , going over the checklist , trying to add numbers . I may rid myself of the memories of my war by having my child born from between my legs . Or I may not . But I will have tried it both ways , and can then dream about all the land in between , if it is there . <p> <p> By CLYDE EDGERTON <p>
