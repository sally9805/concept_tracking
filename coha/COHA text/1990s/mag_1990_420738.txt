Section : International <p> A surprise presidential candidate is a strong second and forces a runoff with Walesa <p> Twenty-one years ago , a frustrated young Pole named Stanislaw Tyminski left home to seek a new life in the West . He found his fortune in Canada , making millions in computers ; in recent years he added a lucrative cable-TV venture in Peru . But Stan Tyminski , a citizen of three countries , had to come home to find fame . Last week , after campaigning briefly on a vague promise of quick riches and even vaguer warnings of anti-Polish conspiracies , he finished an astonishing second to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa in Poland 's presidential election . The two now face a Dec. 9 runoff . Suddenly , Poland 's " man from Mars " has a divided Solidarity movement running scared  --  and many Poles fretting about the political stability of their crisis-racked nation . Said historian Bronislaw Geremek , who until recently served as Solidarity 's parliamentary leader : " We need many , many lessons in democracy . " <p> Poles had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means economic austerity and dull politicians , they 've had enough . Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazo-wiecki , the choice of Solidarity 's intellectual wing , took the high road in the campaign , speaking somberly of the need to stick with painful market-oriented economic reforms . He battled false but damaging rumors he is of Jewish descent . After finishing a distant third with 18 percent of the vote , the prime minister announced his intention to resign after the runoff . " Society has made a choice , " he said . " I am drawing a conclusion from this choice . " <p> Walesa had a conclusion too : he was appalled to be running against a " nobody " like Tyminski . " It 's incomprehensible that after 20 years abroad this deserter could become the First Citizen , " he fumed in an exclusive interview with NEWSWEEK . But some Mazowiecki supporters said Walesa himself set the stage for Tyminski 's dema-gogic approach . Throughout his long campaign , the flamboyant Solidarity leader issued vague populist proposals , played on working-class resentment of the intellectuals and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyminski , in essence , is a caricature of the political style which you , Lech , initiated , " said Adam Michnik , a former Walesa adviser who is now his most emotional critic . <p> Last week Walesa sounded a more contrite note about the divisions plaguing Solidarity , and acknowledged that both wings of the movement had seriously underestimated the level of popular unhappiness with the reforms : " The voters gave us a fatherly spanking , " he said . But he remained committed to the acceleration of Mazowiecki 's own program : " There is no other possibility but a market economy and opening ourselves to the West , " he told NEWSWEEK . At the same time , he'said , " the West must understand that we are undergoing an accelerated course in democracy . If this could be spread over 40 or 50 years , you would n't have the same intensity . " Backed by polls showing him 28 points ahead , Walesa vowed to crush his opponent  --  or , if Tyminski wins , to lead unrest that would push him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first round , he tapped a rich vein of popular discontent and xenophobia . " The second Poland " of young working-class voters in small cities and towns made a receptive audience for his charges of a Mazowiecki-led conspiracy to sell Poland 's industries to unnamed " foreigners . " Zuzanna Hosiawa , 22 , like many poor Poles in her provincial town of Olkusz , believes Tyminski will share secrets of financial success he learned abroad . " I prefer a man from nowhere than those I know , " she says . At a news conference with Walesa on Saturday , Tyminski pulled out the tar bucket . He said he had " very personal " materials about Walesa " in my briefcase . " Walesa mocked the suggestion , arguing the Communists would have exploited such information long ago . <p> The uncontested facts about Tyminski are bizarre , but not necessarily sinister . He arrived in Canada in 1969 , where he studied computers and built a software company called Transduction , Ltd. , into a $5 million-a-year business . Though unknown until now in the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics by winning the chairmanship of the country 's 3,500-member Libertarian Party . Friends in Canada say he decided to run for president of Poland while in Poland to promote his book , " Sacred Dogs , " a free-enterprise tract ghost-written by a former reporter for Poland 's Communist daily and laden with bromides such as " the world belongs to the brave . " <p> Failed scheme : The Peruvian chapter of Tyminski 's career could be a tale from the rollicking fiction of that South American country 's own Mario Vargas Llosa . He first visited Peru in 1981 to see foster children he sponsored under a charity program . He traveled to Iquitos , a swampy city on the Amazon River near the Brazilian border , and apparently fell in love with the place . The next year he moved in , meeting his wife , Graciela , and founding several businesses , including a company to transport gasoline by river to outlying towns . The scheme fell ap , art when Peruvian troops seized his boat , ostensibly for use in operations against local cocaine smugglers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ollie . <p> In 1984 Tyminski set up a satellite dish and launched TVS Iquitos , Peru 's first ca-ble-television company . Enchanted by the channel 's broadcasts of Colombian , Venezuelan , Brazilian and U.S. shows , the people oflquitos started staying home to watch TVS Iquitos instead of going to the movies . The town 's two movie theaters sued Tyminski for " unfair competition , " but Tyminski won the case on appeal in the Peruvian Supreme Court this year . The cinema owners also got a Peruvian congressional committee to accuse Tyminski of retransmitting foreign networks ' shows without parmission , but the report is not legally binding . In any case , diverting satellite signals and flouting copyright laws are tacitly accepted practices in many Latin American . settings  --  largely because foreign broadcasters rarely enforce their rights in such isolated locales as Iquitos . <p> In Peru , Tyminski also went through what Ollie describes as a " Shirley MacLaine style " spiritual awakening while traveling with local Indians . " He was disillusioned with the materialism of the Western world , " says Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He believes that civilization causes a decline of spiritual life . The more cement , the less life . " <p> But Tyminski has had a hard time with other questions . Why , according to Polish press reports confirmed by the Polish Interior Ministry , had he repeatedly stopped at the Polish Consulate in Libya to pick up visas when traveling from Canada to Poland during the reign of Communist President Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski ? Why were several of his current associates linked to the former Polish Communist regime ? Had he once been declared " mentally unfit " to serve in the Polish Army ? Walesa campaign aides assert that Tyminski is a stalking-horse for the old Polish Communist Party , whose members still hold influential posts in industry and the bureaucracy . They cite recent statements by Tyminski suggesting he might leave many companies in the hands of the current managers : the Communists . Tyminski denied the reports of past psychiatric problems , branded the Libya reports " lies " and said a trip to the Soviet Union was to close a deal between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only deepened the doubts . He praised Jaruzelski for " saving " Poland by declaring martial law in 1981 . Last week , on ABC 's " Nightline , " he denied having called for a Polish nuclear-weapons program , claiming he was only referring to nuclear " technology . " " My mother 's life was saved 20 years ago through this type of technology , " he said . " She was in a cancer hospital and she survived because of the cobalt bomb , donated by Polish-Americans to an oncology hospital in Warsaw . " In " Sacred Dogs , " however , Tyminski devotes an entire chapter to the need for a Polish nuclear arsenal , adding that the A-bomb should be named the " Z-bomb . " The Polish word for Jew is Zyd , and Tyminski credits the bomb 's invention to Jewish scientists exiled from Hitler 's Germany . <p> As the election nears , Solidarity is still not completely united behind Walesa . Meanwhile , Tyminski appears to have acquired a coat of electoral Teflon . " The-charges against him are dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warsaw . " They 're trying to make him look bad because he 's doing well . " Whether Walesa 's wide lead in the polls holds on Election Day or not , Poland 's troubled people have already shown they can be swayed by " a man from Mars " who promises them the moon . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : ' Lessons in democracy ' : Tyrninski in Warsaw after the first round ( below ) , Walesa before the voting ( left ) , a scavenger in the industrial region of Silesia , where Tyminski did unexpectedly well <p> By CHARLES LANE with ANDREW NACORSKI in Warsaw , MOLLY COLIN in Montreal and CORINNE SCHMIDT in Lima <p>
