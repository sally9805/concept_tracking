ON THE morning the letter-it was a form letter , actually-arrived from the warden at Joliet prison , I had a lunch date with Max Schecter . Max had retired from the Chicago police department two years earlier . He had been a flyer in World War II and had flown for the Israelis in their war of independence . His business card read Colonel Max Schecter , and , under that , a single word : Mercenary . He was a single-idea man , Max : the idea was that the world was still ou OUt to get the Jews and that most Jews were all too ready to connive in their own ultimate destruction . He wrote lots of letters to the Chicago papers and to the Jewish press , naming the politicians who were really friends of the Jews-almost none qualified-and those who were n't . <p> Max had no distaste for violence-his language bristled with it-but he did n't look anything like the fighter pilot he had been . He was almost aggressively bald ( he had taken to wearing caps indoors ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp . Most of his old power was in his face and especially in his teeth : his smile hinted at the hope that you might make the mistake of trying to mess with him . Even now , Max was not a man to fool with . His voice , with its metallic ring , carried in public places , and , given some of his remarks , this sometimes caused me to wince . <p> Max and I did n't meet often , usually once or twice a year , though he always sent a card on the Jewish holidays . When my wife died , he wrote me a letter about life being little else but a series of losses that I found touching . All the more so , I suppose , because as far as I knew , Max was himself quite alone in the world . <p> " So , David , " he said with one of his knowing smiles as I came up to the table at the Belden Deli , " how 's it hanging ? " He had already set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few xeroxed items , some recent letters he had received , a few he had written , a nicely mangled copy of the Chicago Sun-Times . <p> " By the same few threads , " I answered . " And with you ? " <p> " I could complain , " he said , the teeth flashing , " but who would listen ? " <p> " Max , " I said , sitting down , " I need your advice . I just got a letter from the warden at Joliet , asking permission for an inmate to write to me . I 'm guessing he 's read one of my books . Can you think of a good reason not to say yes ? " <p> " None at all , " said Max , with his sly smile , " as long as you stand ready to do this guy a big favor some day . " <p> " Such as ? " <p> " Begin a correspondence with a con and eventually he 's going to ask you to write a letter to the parole board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets out , to let him stay with you for three or four days , maybe a little longer . If you 're ready for that , what 've you got to lose ? " <p> In other words , if I was prepared to be taken advantage of by a crook-a thief , maybe a child molester or rapist , possibly a murderer-sure , go ahead . After all , whatever else the guy had done in the world , at least he had the excellent taste to admire my wonderful writing . <p> " Thanks , Max , " I said , " that 's helpful . " <p> But not helpful enough , apparently . Because after I returned home and considered the cogency of Max 's words , I still wrote to the warden and said OK It was n't that I did n't believe Max ; it was , I told myself , that even though I was already past sixty , I still believed it was important not to close your heart too quickly . Besides , if the guy asked one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could n't I ? <p> His first letter , which arrived roughly a month later , was in a small and careful hand , with no grammatical or spelling errors : <p> Dear Mr. Ross , <p> This is just to let you know that I enjoyed your novel The Argyle Boys . I grew up in the neighborhood you wrote about . I went to Senn High School like the guys in your book I also hung out like them at Zeitkin 's drugstore . My parents lived on Sheridan near Foster . I was born in 1934 , so I 'm three years older than you . Was the character you call Bronco Levine by any chance based on a guy named Buddy Levitz ? Thanks for writing a good book . And thanks also for giving me permission to write to you . Someday I 'd like to read some more of your other books . <p> The letter was signed Fred C. Duchamp ; somehow the comic dignity of that C. , from prison , made me a little sad . I wrote back to thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Buddy Levitz , who , I reported , had died four years ago of liver cancer . And I sent him another of my novels , West Rogers Park , which also had characters from Senn High School and was set in the time of our boyhood . I was careful not to ask him any questions-including the most interesting one of all , which was why he happened to be in prison . I did n't want to make him think I was looking for a pen pal . <p> A FEW weeks later in the Loop I ran into Lou Stein , who had become one of the chief chroniclers of our youth , and asked him if he remembered a kid named Fred Duchamp . He did : a small guy , according to Lou , with an air of tidiness about him . Played center field in softball games at Clarendon , a good ballplayer , covered a lot of ground , a punch hitter , something of a loner , not sure if he was Jewish or not . I tried hard , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another letter arrived from Joliet . It seems the prison guards were in no hurry to get packages into the hands of prisoners , and so it had taken a while before he 'd gotten my book . But he had now read it , and it , too , reminded him of the old days . West Rogers Park tended to be more solidly middle-class and also more Jewish than his own part of town , along Sheridan Road and Lake Shore Drive . He himself , he volunteered , came of a mixed marriage : his mother was Jewish , his father not-which , in those days , was wild stuff . His mother 's family had sat shiva when she married Earl Duchamp , a car salesman who , his son confided , had been a skirt-chaser and never really made much of a living . Fred , an only child , grew up sleeping on a studio couch in the family 's one-bedroom furnished apartment . " Luck of the draw who you get for parents , " he wrote , " and only a chump would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly beat the hell out of you or something . " He ended by asking if I knew whatever had become of a kid named Frankie Winters , whom he remembered as a fine athlete-great arm-and a sweet guy . <p> Frankie I remembered very well . He was small , with the build of a gymnast , a fine smile , and I recalled hearing that he had married his old girlfriend Nancy . They were the last of the jitterbugs ; at high-school dances , the floor would actually clear-as in an old MGM movie-and Frankie and Nancy would dance alone , everyone else forming a circle to look on . He had become a physical therapist , which was a good bit below the aspirations of most of the Jewish boys I had grown up with , and had long since moved to Peoria . <p> I decided to call Frankie . Claiming to remember me , he asked what I did for a living , which meant he had not known of my books ( he was a minor character in The Argyle Boys ) . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd guy , Freddy , " Frankie said . " He kinda went off on his own . His old man was an operator , a salesman of some sort . Freddy liked to gamble . They used to let him play in poker games at the Somerset Hotel , even when he was still in high school . High stakes . Pretty big stuff in those days . " <p> " Did he ever marry ? " <p> " I do n't know . After high school , I lost touch with him . What 's he doing now , you know ? " <p> " I do n't , " I said , feeling it was n't my place to tell anyone that Freddy Duchamp was in jail . " I only heard about him through a cousin of mine who met him somewhere . " <p> Before hanging up , Frankie informed me that he and Nancy had two daughters , now in their late thirties , and five grandchildren . I sent off a postcard to Freddy Duchamp with this news , allegedly gleaned from someone I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On a return card he wrote , in his meticulous hand : " I liked Frank . I remember him as a kid with no bullshit about him . " And there was a postscript : " Have you ever heard of a writer named Theodore Dreiser ? Am starting to read a book of his . He seems to know the score . " <p> Do n't ask me why , but in Powell 's used bookstore in Hyde Park I bought a copy of W A. Swanberg 's biography of Dreiser and shipped it to Joliet . Three weeks later , Freddy wrote to thank me and to announce that he was up for parole in two weeks and expected to get it . ( " Knock wood , " he added in parentheses . ) Then he was planning to be in Chicago for a few days on his way to the West Coast to visit his daughter in Sacramento . Would I mind if he called ? He 'd like to take me to lunch to pay me back for my kindness . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-con , he 'd understand . <p> " And , by the way , " he added , " I never told you why I am in Joliet . I was sentenced to ten years for armed robbery . I 'll have served a little more than three of them . I was arrested in Schaumburg , for putting a plastic bag in a night depository . I was guilty as hell . I did this three times earlier before getting caught . My big mistake was that the time they caught me I was carrying a gun . Dumb , especially since I 've never shot a gun in my life . When we meet-if we meet-maybe I 'll be able to explain it all . Somehow I still do n't think of myself as a thief But that 's a long story . Maybe everybody 's got a long story . Thanks again for your letters and for the books . " <p> Well , at least Max Schecter was wrong about one thing : I was n't going to be asked to support Freddy Duchamp 's request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it when guys like Max , in their certainty , are wrong . I sent Freddy my unlisted phone number , and said yes , I hoped he 'd call . <p> WHEN HE did , his voice was slightly high and had a refined quality to it . He planned to be in town for two , maybe three days on family business before taking off for California by bus , and was staying at the Lawson YMCA , on Chicago Avenue . He had a taste for deli . Was there a good one nearby where we could meet ? I proposed The Bagel , on Broadway near Belmont , the last Jewish deli in Chicago not owned and run by Greeks . We agreed to meet the next day at noon . <p> " I 'm small , " he said when I asked what he looked like , " with white hair , but not a lot of it left . Do n't worry , I 'll find you from the photos on your books . " <p> I had beat him to The Bagel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the door . Freddy entered exactly on time : about five-foot-six , smallboned , with thinning white hair brushed straight back . He looked as if he had just emerged from a shower . He wore a blue windbreaker over a white shirt , tan pants neatly creased . His plain-toed , black shoes and the transparent frames of his glasses looked as if they might be prison-issue . He carried a small gym bag . I waved . <p> " Fred Duchamp , " he said , extending a hand while sliding smoothly into the booth . <p> " David Ross . " I shook his hand , which was small , the skin dry but soft . The nails on his slender fingers , I noted , had a coat of polish . What had he done in prison , I wondered , made license plates , worked in a laundry , maybe in the library ? All I knew about jail was what I had seen in the movies . Had he beenevery man 's fantasy terror-raped ? His experience of the world was a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " it must feel good to be out " <p> " Very good , " he said . " Amazingly good , in fact " <p> The waitress came to take our order , and I asked for an egg-white omelette and coffee . He ordered corned beef , on a kaiser roll , with french fries , three pickles , and a Coke . <p> " I used to worry about cholesterol , " he smiled briefly . " Prison food takes your mind off it . " <p> " Was it as tough as advertised ? " <p> " You get used to it , " he said , " and you meet some extraordinary types . " <p> " This your only time ? " <p> " I once did eight months , in Sandstone , in Minnesota , for writing bad checks . Next to Joliet , Sandstone was a piece of cake , a rest home . " <p> " How 'd you happen to get caught carrying a gun ? " <p> " You want the long version or the short version ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'll invent one . " <p> Our food arrived . Freddy took a small bite of his enormous sandwich , chewing slowly , really tasting the food as if it were a rare wine , which , after years at Joliet , it must have seemed . <p> " After I graduated high school , I decided that I did n't need college . School bored me , even though I was n't too bad at it . Through my old man I got a job working as a flunky for a guy whose territory was Chicago , selling Hart , Schaffner &; Marx clothes . Very big firm in those days , you may remember . After a couple of years I was given a territory of my own . It included Iowa and the Dakotas , northern Minnesota . Ever been in Grand Forks , North Dakota , in February ? " <p> " I have n't had the pleasure . " <p> " I soon had enough of such pleasures myself . It was time to come off the road . Hart , Schaffner controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Shore-this was before the neighborhood went completely black-and I worked out a deal to take it over . " <p> " What year would that 've been ? " <p> " Winter of 1959 . It was called the Pickwick Shop , on Jeffrey , just off 71st Street . The plan was for me to own the joint outright in seven years . Meanwhile , I got married , had a kid , and went off to my store six days a week . <p> " Sounds like you were a good citizen . " <p> " Absolutely . Except that after maybe three years of this I 'm going out of my gourd . I 'm down on my knees adjusting the break on the trousers of old men , worrying that I 've bought too many long-sleeved knit polo shirts that I ca n't move , hating every minute of it , and at the same time thinking maybe I ought to be looking into opening a second store in the new shopping center in Flossmore . And I probably would have , except for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four bookies in town and bet a combined ten grand on the Phillies to beat the Cubs-Steve Carleton was pitching against Kenny Holtzman-and won . It was a completely nuts thing to do . But I did it and came out winners . <p> " A nice afternoon 's work . " <p> " You know how many pairs of socks , or Hathaway shirts , or even Hickey-goddamn-Freeman suits you have to sell to clear ten grand ? Anyhow , for the first time in my life I felt like I was my own boss . I was in action , like the gamblers say . As a kid , I used to play the football parley cards in high school , and I would sit in on poker games at the Somerset . I was a strong gin player , too . But this was different This was flying . " <p> " What did your wife say ? " <p> " Whaddya , kiddin ' me ? Why would I tell my wife ? Every gambler keeps three sets of books : a fake one for his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real one for himself . " <p> Signaling the waitress , he ordered another Coke and a piece of cheese cake . I had a refill on my coffee . <p> " I DO N'T know what you must have felt when you decided you could write , but maybe it 's the same . My mind was never at rest I was always worked up , but happily worked up , if you know what I mean . " <p> " I know exactly what you mean , " I said . <p> " I was always thinking about angles , odds , deviations , possible scores . I started betting baseball games regularly . I studied pitchers ; I looked into streaks , weather conditions , the effects of minor injuries . " <p> " Were you making more ten-grand bets ? " <p> " No . Never . Every so often I would take a flyer and bet a grand , but mostly it was two or three hundred bucks a game , depending on what I thought of the line . I was doing OK , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway , there was n't much to do at the store now that the blacks were coming into South Shore and the whites were leaving in panic . You did n't see too many black guys in Harris tweed sports jackets , plaid shirts , and khaki pants with a little belt in the back . I opened the joint in the morning mostly to study the Sporting News and call in my bets . " <p> " Sounds like the Pickwick Shop was a front , without your meaning it to be . " <p> " Yeah , I guess it was . But to get on with the end of my days as a haberdasher , one day , around noon , I 'm on the phone , calling in my bets , when in walk three black guys , maybe in their early twenties . Two of them pull guns , and the third tells me to get on the floor , face down . " <p> " What did you do ? " <p> " I 'm not sure you 'll believe this , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing going in the Pirates-Dodgers game and now I might not get my bet in time . They go over to the cash register where they get about eighty bucks , and another twenty-two-hundred in my money clip and my watch and wedding ring off me . Then they 're about to leave and they tell me to count to a thousand before I get up off the floor when , for some crazy reason , I hear myself saying , How 're you boys fixed for socks and underwear ? ' This brought me a kick in the side of the head from the guy who was n't carrying the gun . Six weeks later I locked the place and never looked back . Even today , I hear the word inventory , ' I get nervous . " <p> " What did your wife say ? " <p> " She did n't say anything because she did n't know anything . Rochelle assumed I was looking for a location for another store . What I was really looking for was someone to beat the Celtics at long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dentist now , lives in Highland Park . I gave her a tough time . " <p> " Because of the gambling ? " <p> " Because of having to hide the gambling . To put her off what was really going on , I pretended to be having love affairs-the last thing a real gambler is interested in . I 'd do things like leave condoms in my pockets , or put bits of lipstick on a shirt collar . When she confronted me , I made a full confession and promised never to do it again . She wanted me to go into psychotherapy . I said I would consider it . This was when the LA Lakers were on a 3 3-game streak , and I had them almost all the way , most nights easily beating the spread . I was on a roll . I could 've afforded a team of shrinks . It lasted three years before I started to lose . But then I lost big-time . I could n't have won a bet on the outcome of World War II . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tap city . " <p> " And then ? " <p> " Things dragged on for a while . Shelley eventually found out about the gambling . She wanted me to go to her father to get money for therapy . I agreed to see some guy . He had an office in the Loop , but at our first meeting I saw that he did n't have a clue . He said my gambling was self-destructive , which did n't seem very interesting . What this guy did n't understand was that gambling was n't a substitute for something missing in my life . It was my life . I never felt guilty about it . The only guilt I feel is for making a stupid bet . " <p> " What about your wife ? No guilt there ? " <p> " None . She remarried the right man . True , I missed out on raising my daughter , but she seems to have survived in good shape . The thing about a gambling life is that you only got to take care of yourself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide food and shelter for myself , no inventory . I travel light . There 're certain jobs in life that make it wrong to marry and bring someone else into your life , when you do n't really have time for them . Gambling 's got ta be one of them . " <p> PERHAPS I had been around too many writers , academics , lawyers , people shuffling one kind of paper or another , but I found Freddy Duchamp 's direct experience of life impressive , and that he had also thought so clearly about his choices in life made him seem somehow attractive . I knew that I had n't the courage to operate so wholly on my own . <p> " I 'm sure you 've heard it before , David-OK to call you David ? - but life is a gamble . You get up every morning hoping you do n't find a funny little lump in your gonads when showering , or an odd throbbing in your left arm when driving to work . You turn onto the freeway and wonder if some hopped-up punk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pieces . You come home at night and hope your wife has n't taken off with the nice-looking guy that runs the produce department at the supermarket . It 's all a gamble , right ? " <p> " From a certain point of view , " I said , " I suppose it is . But most of what you 're calling gambles are really out of a man 's control : the cancer , the car crash , the wife running off . Does n't a full-time gambler like to court danger ? He 's asking for it-he ca n't live without it . " <p> " Can you live without writing ? " <p> " Probably not , but if I do n't write , or if I start a book that flops , it is n't the same as losing twenty grand in Vegas . " <p> " I do n't go to Vegas . I do n't go to race tracks , either . The crowds at both places , so many losers under one roof , make me sadder than hell . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss every now and then is n't such a terrible thing . Take my word for it . I 've had some high-voltage jolts in this business . But a big loss can sometimes put the world in perspective . After you 're tapped out you can sometimes see things a lot clearer . You know you have to stir yourself , rebound , not let defeat get the best of you . Do n't get me wrong . Between winning and losing , winning is always a lot better . But even losing is n't , if you get me , a total loss . " <p> " Forgive my asking , but is doing time at Joliet part of losing ? " <p> " No , that should n't have happened . But I did something stupid . I got in the hole with the boys . I made the mistake of borrowing from Guido to pay Dominic . I 'm talking juice . Guido started to lean on me . One day a few of the boys picked me up outside my apartment on Marine Drive . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball bat , an aluminum one . They promised to do the same to my head if I did n't get up to date on my payments . I bought a gun , which I began to keep in the glove compartment . " <p> " So that 's why a nice half-Jewish boy like you was packing heat ? " <p> " Heat ? I see you go to the movies . Well , carrying a gun by itself is n't going to get you into much trouble . A warning , a slap on the wrist , usually nothing more . My problem was that the cops in Schaumburg found the gun in my car the night they picked me up fishing out the plastic bag I had planted in the night depository . This gave them the opportunity to turn robbery into armed robbery , and that meant hard time at Joliet . " <p> I wanted to ask him details about life in prison , but thought better of it . " Where do you go from here ? " I asked instead . <p> " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for under fifty bucks a night , for tonight and Thursday night . " <p> " I thought you were staying at the Lawson Y " <p> " I checked out this morning . Could n't take it . At least in Joliet they lock the inmates up at night . The noise in the halls there is wild . " <p> Never smother a generous impulse , my mother used to say , and now I heard myself saying , " Look , I have an extra room . It 's got a foldout couch . Not the most comfortable thing in the world , but it 's yours for the next two nights if you want it . " <p> " That 's nice of you , " he said . " Really nice . But I need to be in touch with someone first . A guy promised to drive me out to Rosehill on Thursday . I want to visit my parents ' graves before I leave town . " <p> When he got up to use the phone I sat wondering if I 'd done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least he is n't a killer , or a rapist , or a child molester . Gambling-it 's practically a white-collar crime . Is it even a crime ? Where 's the victim ? He was a neat enough looking guy . If my wife were still alive , of course , I 'd never have invited him to stay . But I could save him a hundred bucks , which might come in handy when he was with his daughter . I wondered if Freddy , like me , was by now a grandfather . No place for a zaide , prison . Nor was the Lawson Y <p> When he returned , the waitress set down the check . I reached for it , but he grabbed it out from under my hand . <p> " This is mine . " <p> " Can I at least leave the tip ? " <p> " No , " he said , floating a $5 bill onto the table , and adding with a quick smile , " But a better tip , in my opinion , is to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points . " <p> As we drove over to my place on Belden I told Freddy I would n't be able to spend much time with him over the next two days . I had a family dinner that night , and the next day I was involved in a panel at Loyola University that figured to take up most of the day , with a dinner in the evening as part of the deal . But he would have a key and could come and go as he liked , and he could help himself to anything he found in the refrigerator . I was an instant-coffee man ; I hoped he did n't mind . <p> " After Joliet , " he said , " instant coffee is luxury to me . " <p> At the apartment I showed him the room with the studio couch . He looked around . Then he asked , rather shyly , I thought , " Excuse me , but do you have an iron I can use ? Right now I just own these pants , three white shirts , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash the stuff out in the kitchen sink if it 's OK with you . " <p> There was a washer-dryer in the apartment . I showed him where it was and how to use it . An extra robe , blue terrycloth , was hanging on the back of the bathroom door ; he was free to use that , too . <p> " Thanks , " he said , " this is gon na help a lot . What time you figure to leave tomorrow ? " <p> " I have to be at Loyola by nine , " I said . <p> " My friend wo n't be picking me up for the cemetery till ten . So if I do n't see you tonight , I 'll catch you in the morning . " <p> " Great , " I said . " Take it easy . Take care of yourSelf . " <p> Returning home that night at around eleven-thirty , I looked into the open door of his room . The light from the hall threw a slightly eerie light over my guest , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers tossed off , arms up and behind him , head resting on his locked hands . Although when awake he displayed the easy coordination of the former athlete , I saw that Freddy , in his undershorts , had an old man 's body , bony and white , the skin crepe-like on the underside of his arms , his chest and legs hairless . A plate of dentures-lowers , I thought-soaked in a glass on a nearby lamp table . The hollows in his eyes were deep , the skin around them veiny , purplish . Life , his body declared , had n't been easy . <p> I WALKED into the kitchen at six the next morning . Freddy was at the table in my old blue robe , a cup of coffee and the Trib before him . <p> " Another dumb Bears draft , " he pronounced , looking up from the sports section . " Dumbest team in pro football . Dumbest management , dumbest coaches , dumbest players . Betting against them since 1964 a man would be rich today .

Contemplating the people sharing the platform with me , I wished I had gone into the used-car business . <p> At ten-thirty that night , exhausted , I turned the key to my apartment , reminding myself that whenever I 'd expected something to result in easy money , it never worked out . The place was dark . Freddy , I assumed , was already asleep . I flipped on the light switch in the hall to find the apartment emptystripped of its belongings . Furniture , prints on the walls , Oriental rugs , stereo system , books : everything was gone . Or almost everything . My clothes were still in their closets , and the shirts , socks , underwear , and other things once in my large bureau in the master bedroom were piled neatly on the floor . My computer and printer lay on the floor of the room I used as an office , the papers from my desk and file cabinet in piles . Food was still in the kitchen cabinets ; the refrigerator was still humming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of my Bobby , my wife , who had lovingly acquired all the furniture in this apartment , and the only thing that came to my mind was the old sports cliche : " We wuz robbed ! " <p> In the kitchen , scotch-taped to the refrigerator , was a sheet from one of my yellow legal pads , folded in half . I removed and opened it : <p> Dear David ( if I may ) , <p> I got $4,500 for the furniture and books . It 's probably worth more , but I did n't have much time for haggling , especially on a cash deal . I needed the money to get myself back into action . Maybe one day I 'll get it back to you , though I suppose the chances are somewhere around 11-5 against . By the way , I do n't have a daughter , in Sacramento or anyplace else , so no point in looking for me there . Life 's a gamble , pal , and I guess you lost this one . Sorry . <p> Fred C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so stupid I could have sat down and wept , except that there was n't a chair to sit down on . <p> " SO , MAX , " I said at Starbuck 's on Diversey two weeks later , " am I a damn fool or what ? " <p> Max had already informed me it was too late to put out an APB on Freddy Duchamp ; and he thought the likelihood of my recovering my furniture and books rather small . <p> " What you are is another guy who fell for a wolf in wolf 's clothing , " Max offered . " Happens all the time . Look at the broads who are stimulated by obviously worthless men . It 's as if it 's the worthlessness that excites them . People think they can change other people . Ai n't going to happen . " <p> I did n't argue with Max . But in fact I did n't think he had it quite right . Part of my job as a novelist was to investigate other people 's motives , and while I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at least I knew my own . After Freddy cleaned me out , I felt at first rather the way he said he had felt after a serious gambling loss . Foolish , but , somehow , my place in the world seemed clearer than before . <p> And now I suddenly realized that my offer to correspond with Freddy Duchamp and then to help him out had not arisen entirely out of large-heartedness . I 'd thought I could make use of him ; I 'd thought he 'd furnish me with material-that the story of his life could become , once I wrote it , my story . He had picked me out as a potential mark , and I had done the same with him . There had been corruption enough , then , to go around . From me Freddy got the money to put himself back in action . I lost my furniture but got my story . In the end it was what gamblers call a wash . <p> " More coffee ? " asked Max , rising from his chair . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp to the counter , I slid his Sun-Times to my side of the table and turned to the middle pages . I 'd heard there was a big sale at Marshall Field 's . <p> Author Affiliation
