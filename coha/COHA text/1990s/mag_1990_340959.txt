When Karen Finley takes the stage , you 're not at My Fair Lady . A typical solo work by the New York-based performance artist involves a flood of ranting * profanity , unspeakable desires , feral behavior and sexual politics . Assuming the character of a rapist or an abusive husband , Finley acts out the darkest imaginings of men , the furies of mind and body that she sees as the source of degradations suffered by women . In the process , she fills the stage with shrieks and spit , sometimes stripping off her clothes and smearing food across her body . In a now legendary piece that she introduced several years ago , she slathered yams around her buttocks . <P> Conservative columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak predict that Finley , whose work has been supported in the past by three NEA grants ( $22,000 in total awards ) , will be the next target of outrage  --  and opportunity  --  for enemies of the endowment 's funding . Finley , the columnists warned , could become " the Mapplethorpe case of 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week that suggestion of scandal was enough to shake the National Council on the Arts , the beleaguered body that oversees grants recommended by NEA panels . The council voted to postpone until August its decision on all grant applications for performance work . <P> " I use certain language that is a symptom of the violence of the culture , " Finley insists . " If I talk about a woman being raped , I have to use the language of the perpetrators . " While her wild orations about menstruation and excrement have been known to rattle even shockproof veterans of New York City 's downtown art scene , they have also won her a raft of admiring reviews . When she performed at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in January , the Star Tribune used words like heartfelt and moving to describe We Keep Our Victims Ready , a verse piece about the consequences of male violence for women , gays and the homeless . The same piece was also singled out by Evans and Novak , who took exception to the fact that at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she describes as " a symbol of women being treated like dirt . " <P> Next month she will repeat that performance at New York City 's Lincoln Center , a redoubt of sober establishment culture . " My work is not about entertainment , " she says . " People usually leave my shows crying . " After leaving one of them , her grandmother sent her a note . It was a mixed review that could sum up the dilemma that any unbridled artist poses for the NEA . " She said that I was talented , " Finley recalls , " but also a toiletmouth. "
