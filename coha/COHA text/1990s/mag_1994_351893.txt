Quiet satisfaction suffuses Big John 's bar in Charleston , South Carolina , an establishment that caters to the Citadel , the town 's revered military school . The Icehouse draft beer is flowing , and all 's well with the world ; or , more precisely , everything 's in its place . The Confederate flag and the flag of the South Carolina secession are tacked next to Old Glory near the ceiling ; the IMPEACH CLINTON sticker beneath the flags seems practically to glow ; the cadets and their sweethearts are crowding the red vinyl-covered benches ; and Shannon Faulkner 's hair  --  the proximate cause for the celebratory mood  --  is still on her head . <P> Faulkner , 19 , will not be getting a crew cut on Monday . Nor will she be forced to walk in gutters instead of on sidewalks . She will not be assuming the distorted " brace " position to accept any abuse an upperclassman cares to dish out . Or doing push-ups until she vomits . She will not be submitting to  --  or struggling against  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Citadel , the all-male military college that is Charleston 's pride , because , as of Friday , a federal appeals court wo n't let her . <P> There is no law on the books preventing people from injecting themselves into uncomfortable situations . And it is Faulkner 's hope , now somewhat dented , that there are laws preventing them from being excluded . The Citadel is , without doubt , one of Southern education 's more idiosyncratic institutions . Founded in 1842 ( it boasts that its cadets fired the first shots of the Civil War : at a Union ship ) , the college is a proud dinosaur of the Old South , notable today for two things . One is its alumni network , which includes at least one South Carolina Senator , one former Governor and countless other sons of Dixie whose extraordinary mutual loyalty gives them enormous local clout . The other is its abysmal treatment of freshmen , or " knobs , " so named because their shaved heads resemble doorknobs . Some claim the first flows from the second , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth it : the school has withstood claims of hazing , particularly an incident involving a black cadet . <P> It was Faulkner 's choice to take the bad with the good . She applied  --  and was accepted  --  last year . Then the Citadel , learning she was female , reneged . Faulkner sued for discrimination  --  the school is state funded  --  and last month , Federal District Judge C. Weston Houck ruled in her favor , saying she could attend the school as a full-fledged cadet beginning with the start of the new school year  --  this Monday .
