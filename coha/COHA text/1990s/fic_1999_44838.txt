Those of you who are new to this publication might know Ms. Rusch " s name from her novels in " The Fey series , the most recent of which , Victory , appeared a few months ago . ( You folks can nowlook forward to the " Black Throne " series , which will be set on the same world . ) Or you might recognize her byline from the short stories of hers that have appeared recently in anthologies like First Lady Murders and Black Cats and Broken Mirrors . But you really ought to be aware that Ms. Rusch was editor of this magazine for six years , during which time she won one Hugo Award and was nominated for a host of other honors . She gave up this cushy job two years ago to spend more time writing . We think this dark and moody fantasy will help you see why she made that difficult choice . <p> THE GULLS SWARMED OVER the Sandcastle Hotel . Whipping and diving and cawing to their fellows , they looked like something out of Daphne du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinister and terrifying than anything Hitchcock ever produced . Charles watched from his deck . The morning breeze was harsh and smelled of salt . He still wore his silk pajamas . Rain the night before had left the wood damp and cold . His ancient tattered slippers , the ones Grace had given him before she died , were getting wet . Grace and gulls . He closed his eyes , knowing what the night would bring . Then he shook off the thought , hoping , this time , he would have the resolve to let it end . Charles opened his eyes and rested his hands on the damp rail . The swarming had grown worse . Nearly a hundred birds flocked to that tiny section of beach . There was no way he would go down there . At least , not alone . He sighed , went inside , and called Dan Retsler . Dan Retsler was scanning the Oregonian as he stood near the window of the police station . The window overlooked Highway 101 , the main thoroughfare down the Oregon Coast . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the summer , he would be the primary witness to petty thefts , tourists running red lights , and the occasional fender-bender . His police department had a staff of three , not counting the dispatcher . He put two officers on at night . During the day , he and a lone officer could handle the problems with the help of the dispatcher . The dispatcher , one Miss Lucy Wexel , had been with the department since Retsler was a teenage hoodlum at Taft High School . He doubted she was any different when she was hired than she was now . She chewed gum , talked tough , and believed her work safeguarded the mean streets of Whale Rock for yet another day . The phone rang and she answered . Then she stabbed the hold button with a stubby finger , and paused to take a draw from her cigarette before facing him . Smoke curled around her face , making her look like someone 's kindly grandmother instead of the hardest woman he had ever known . " Charles Bishop , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about . He wound around the gun-metal desks to the small cubicle he called an office . Then he grabbed the receiver on the ancient black phone , and punched line one . " Gulls ? " he asked . " Got another report , huh ? " Bishop sounded vaguely relieved , as if a burden were being lifted from him . " No , " Retsler said . " Lucky guess . " He rubbed his nose with his thumb and forefinger , trying to ease a building headache . He knew the drill : first the gulls , then the body pecked beyond recognition , and finally the county coroner , who would claim death by drowning and deny everything else . " Where should I meet you ? " Bishop asked . " At the turnout , " Retsler said . He 'd long ago stopped demanding that Bishop stay home . Bishop would do as he pleased . For some reason , he always chose to join Retsler in shooing the gulls away . And then holding watch over the ruined mass of flesh until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one showed up just after Bishop arrived in town . He had called Retsler and begun their tradition . A young woman , somewhere between sixteen and twenty-six ( judging by the age and condition of her remaining internal organs ) , washed up on the beach . The gulls swarmed . The tourists were terrified , and someone started a rumor that she had jumped from the Sandcastle 's roof , desolate about a love affair gone bad . Only no one knew her , and no one was reported missing . Definitely not a suicide , the coroner , Hamilton Denne , had said as he knelt gingerly beside the body , getting his expensive gray slacks covered with sand . But he could n't rule out death by drowning . He could n't confirm it either since her lungs were missing , her chest cavity ravaged , and her face gone . He could say for certain that she had died , and that she had spent a long time in the water . He would say nothing more . Not even when Retsler asked about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of her teeth had fillings . Not enough to identify her , but enough to cause Bishop consternation . He was a newly retired dentist , and he said , with a single glance , that no one used that odd mixture of iron and silver fillings anymore . No one had since the thirties . A week later , a second body turned up . A boy , between ten and eighteen , dead against the sea wall . Then the stories emerged , stories about why the Sandcastle had closed in the early seventies . Guests reported strangers in their rooms , a strange briny smell in the hallway , and frightening attacks in the middle of the night . Soon the hotel stood empty , even in the busy summer . The owners tried to sell the hotel , failed , and closed the doors . Lucy heard that they had discovered another body inside the day they boarded it up , but no one had any record of it . And so the curse of the Sandcastle began . But locals did not discuss it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with the bodies , and Bishop because of guilt . Because of his wife . Charles stood in the gravel turnout near the beach access . He wore his waterproof jacket and a pair of knitted gloves , the last pair Grace had made for him . The other gloves were in his bedroom closet , frayed reminders of her and the lack of her . He had his back to the path , hands shoved in his pockets , the wind off the ocean wiping his remaining hair into his face . The traffic on 101 was Saturday heavy , but so far no one had stopped to see what was drawing the gulls . They were still diving for the body . Their caws sounded like screams up close , a woman 's scream , desperate and alone . He shivered in spite of himself . At last Retsler 's blue sedan pulled into the turnout , spraying gravel like shotgun pellets . Dan Retsler was forty , but drove as if he were eighteen and immortal . Charles often wondered how Retsler managed to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wearing his green cop 's rain slicker and waders . In his right hand , he clutched the bullhorn . In his left , a rifle . He handed Charles the bullhorn , then dug in the car a moment longer , emerging with a bag of popcorn big enough to feed a family of five . " Where 's Eddie ? " Charles asked . " The Billows . He knows what to do . " They all did . They had done it often enough . Charles hefted the bullhorn , turned it on its side , made sure the speaker was off , and turned the control to " siren . " Retsler loaded his rifle , but kept the safety on . The bag of popcorn leaned against his leg like a small child . " Ready ? " he asked . Charles nodded . They turned together and stared at the gulls , circling and crying , white perfection against an azure sky . The ocean smelled strongly of brine , but the wind had died . Retsler led the way across the narrow footpath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm had churned up the beach , leaving piles of sea-blackened driftwood and gifts of garbage from the sea-bottom . The tide was out , but the sand was still wet , attesting to the power of the storm . Sea foam dried in a reflective green pattern across the flat part of the beach . No one walked here except summer people . Locals avoided this stretch of beach , making excuses about the rocks , the driftwood , the soft sand . Sometimes Charles walked down the steps , sitting on the bottom one and staring at the remains of Whale Rock , the one that gave the town its name . It no longer looked like a whale as it had at the turn of the century ; now it looked like a parking lot in the middle of the sea . Even the strength of rock succumbed to the power of the ocean . The gulls formed a sea of their own near the Sandcastle 's deteriorating wall . The sight was formidable , not frightening , something none of the stories about birds - not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood on a flat rock protruding from the sand and clutched the bullhorn . Retsler stood beside him , popcorn in one hand , rifle in the other . " Here goes nothing , " Charles said . He picked up the bullhorn and flicked it on . The siren wailed like amplified feedback . He cringed , wishing he had remembered ear plugs . Retsler had n't moved . He stared intently at the gulls . They took a few hesitant steps , then the first flew into the sky , followed by another , then another , until the entire flock was airborne . They soared , their screeches hidden by the bullhorn 's wail . This was where Eddie came in . He was supposed to toss bread from the Billows 's deck . Sometimes he caught the birds " attention ; sometimes he did n't . This time he did . They flew in ever widening circles north , crying their protest at the siren , and communicating the message to other gulls about food ahead . They left this isolated section of beach tom up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the body , one leg bent as if the person were just resting on its back , watching the clouds . Neither Charles nor Retsler left the rock . They had done that too early once , and he still had nightmares about it . Of all the creatures on God 's earth , birds seemed to be the only ones without souls . Finally the last gull disappeared behind the bluff that hid the Billows . Charles shut off the bullhorn . The sound stopped , but his ears ached , and would , probably , until the following day . But if things ran true to form , he would n't notice . He shuddered , wished , just once , that this would all end . Then Retsler inclined his head toward the body , and Charles nodded . Together they stepped off the rock and headed down the beach . RETSLER CLUTCHED the bag tightly . The rifle was heavy in his right hand . He hoped he would n't have to use either . The last time had convinced him that the gulls were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he discovered that a single bag of popcorn barely gave him time enough to escape . The extra large bag might give them a few extra seconds , which they would need . Bishop did n't run well anymore . Retsler always worried about bringing him to the beach . But if they did n't go together , Bishop might have come alone , a risk that Retsler just could n't take . The fetid odor of decaying flesh mixed with the scent of salt . This one had been out here longer than the others . Odd that the gulls would prey on it now . He led the way across the rocks and onto the soft sand . The body was shoved against the sea wall like all the others , one leg bent in a V , arms outflung above the head . Retsler knew without looking that the eyes would be gone . The gulls always took those first , some kind of avian delicacy , followed by the tongue if they could get it , and then they would peck their way into the stomach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , but on bodies washed up all over the beach . Retsler followed the three-pronged bird prints to the corpse 's side . He set down the popcorn , reached in his pocket for the Vicks , and smeared some inside his nose . Without looking , he handed the bottle over his shoulder to Bishop . No one needed to smell this , not even for a moment . Bishop took the bottle but stayed back . Retsler crouched near the body , tried to see what it had been through the mess the gulls had made . Male , older , judging by the strands of gray mixed with the wet curls on top of the head , corpse white and bloated . It had been in the water a long , long time . Maybe it was n't one of the bodies that came to this beach . Maybe it was a true death by drowning , not some mystery killing offshore . Then he saw what he hoped he would n't ; the remains of a vest with a gold watch still tucked inside , pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg , garters to hold up the socks . Old man clothing pre-1950 . He glanced at Bishop , who pointed at the open mouth . Tobacco stained teeth , cracked , crooked , and broken . No modem dentist would allow such a travesty . Bishop set down the bullhorn . " I 'll call the coroner , " he said . That night , they got drunk . Bishop tried to beg off , but Retsler , afraid he 'd go home and brood , convinced him to brood in public . They went to the False Colors , a local bar that had once started as a tourist attraction . But the pirate theme seemed more foreboding than touristy , and tourists usually spent an uncomfortable hour before sliding their way out the door . Retsler usually liked the black and white skull-and-crossbones hanging over the door , the uneven wooden floor , the skulls lining the fireplace mantel , the sound of sea chanties sung with unusual heartiness through the stereo speakers . Usually . On this night it seemed a bit much . But Lucy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigar , her unpainted chair tilted back against the stones in the fireplace . Eddie was nursing his third beer , and Bishop was downing gin and tonics as if he actually liked the stuff . Retsler had just bummed one of Lucy 's cigars when the coroner walked in . Hamilton Denne never set foot in a bar . He occasionally frequented establishments where fine liquor was served . He lived in Glen Ellyn Cove , a gated community for Whale Rock 's considerable wealthy population . The Cove had a five-star restaurant near its gate , a private club upstairs , and an atmosphere as snooty as Denne 's name . Most of Denne 's neighbors had no idea what he did for a living . If they asked , he always told them that he was a medical examiner . He worked hard to keep his name out of the papers , easy to do since the coroner 's position in Seavy County was an appointed , not an elected , position . If it was necessary to mention the coroner at all , the paper usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense in offending the Dennes of Glen Ellyn Cove . Denne ordered a Glenlivet and was tersely informed he would get Chivas or the bar scotch or no scotch at all . He settled for the Chivas , and carried it to the table himself . Retsler said nothing . He was on his second local stout and his judgment was impaired , but not that impaired . Eddie peered over his longneck as if he did n't believe what he saw . Bishop slid his gin and tonic toward the center of the table , unfinished . Lucy set her chair down on all four legs , leaned forward , and said , " Want a cigar , Your Highness ? " " No , thanks , " Denne said , and pulled out a silver cigarette case engraved with his initials , no doubt a gift from his obscenely wealthy wife . Being the coroner , Retsler believed , was Denne 's secret rebellion against that elegant woman whose bank account had bought Denne all the good things in life . Denne removed a cigarette , tapped the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked at all of them as if he saw what their breathalyzer results would be . Then he put the cigarette in his mouth , lit it with a matching silver lighter , and took a long drag . " I was n't here , " he said , smoke billowing out with each word . " Not now , not ever . You ever claim I was or breathe a word about what I 'm about to say , I 'll deny it . Is that clear ? " Lucy tilted her chair back . Bishop stared blearily at the table . Eddie lifted his long-neck in mock toast , then cradled it against his chest . " I 'm sure no one would believe us anyway , " Retsler said . " I 'm sure you 're right . " Denne took another drag , the gesture curiously defiant , like a teenage boy smoking in front of his parents . " Some coroners are n't very thorough , you know . " Retsler knew . He and Denne had come on at the same time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it more than once over lunch - in North County , away from Denne 's snobby friends . " But for those who are , the human cadaver is a wealth of information . " " So you going to dick with us or tell us what you found ? " Eddie said . Retsler shushed him . He knew Denne . Denne would talk in his own time . " Take , for instance , someone who drowned . Easy call , from the general condition of the body to water in the lungs . Most coroners would leave it there . Some would do a routine check for other fluids , and some would test the water in the lungs . " Bishop had picked up his drink . He clutched it in one hand , knuckles white . " If the water 's salt , possible accidental death by drowning . But if the water 's fresh - " " He had his lungs ? " Retsler asked . " Regrettably no , " Denne said . " And if he had , it would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulls . " " So he 'd been there a long time ? " Bishop asked . Denne did n't answer . He took a sip of the scotch , winced , and pushed the glass aside . " In 1936 , a yacht went down near the Rock . " " The Lady June , " Lucy said . " Quite a scandal . " " Retsler peered at her , doing a slow calculation in his head . She had been six at the time . It was hard to imagine her as a six-year-old . " Right , " Denne said . " You know about it ? " " They do n't , " Lucy said . Denne nodded , resumed as if he had n't been interrupted at all . " It had been a clear night . She 'd gone out of the bay with a complement of fifty , all there to celebrate the engagement of June Brooks to Lester Dyston . June , the darling daughter of J. William Brooks of the Portland Brookses " The lumber baron 's family , " Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch . Dyston was a Midwestern transplant who held some sort of managerial position at Brooks Lumber . Thirty of Portland 's best families were invited to the celebration . Many declined because the party was being held in Whale Rock in May , and most were n't ready to open their beach houses just yet . " " Lucky most of them did , too , " Lucy said , " or it would have been Portland 's version of the Titanic . " This time , Denne glared at her . She shrugged , stuck the cigar back in her mouth , and crossed her arms , as if she thought he 'd get the story all wrong . " The ship went down in the middle of a storm . Only Dyston survived . He claimed he was carried to shore by mermaids . " Denne glanced at Lucy , who did n't even blink . " And people believed him ? " Eddie said . Denne smiled . " Maybe not about the mermaids . But he was young , he was strong , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away when the tide is out . " " So what does this have to with our bodies ? " Bishop asked . " A couple of things . " Denne stubbed out his half-finished cigarette , grabbed his glass , and downed the scotch like water . The taste apparently did n't matter to him anymore . " First , the Sandcastle was built from the old Brooks mansion . Second , neither the yacht nor the bodies were ever recovered , and third , we have in the cooler the body of J. William himself . " Retsler felt a lightness in his stomach that had nothing to do with the beer . " You 're sure ? " " As sure as I 'll ever be , " Denne said . " This one came complete with identification . The watch was engraved , so was his wedding ring . " " That 's not enough , " Retsler said . " You 're right . J. William 's habits were legendary , from his love of a good cigar to his adoration of spicy food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from then on , that leg was shorter than the other . His ulcer operation made medical history at the time . " " You studied a lot about this man , " Retsler said . " I had cause . " Denne let the words hang , but Retsler knew why . The bodies had been bothering Denne too , only he had some idea where they had come from . He had been waiting for definitive proof . And apparently he had found it . " What convinced you this was Brooks ? " Bishop asked . " The leg might have done it , " Denne said . " But it was the ulcer scar . The surgeon stitched the stomach closed , then stitched the skin incision separately . He removed the external stitches but not the internal ones . That was bad enough , but I could have chalked it up to carelessness . No . But that was n't it . It was the stitches themselves . No one uses wire for sutures these days . No one has for a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies came from that ship ? " Bishop asked . Denne nodded . " So what , they all return on the anniversary of the sinking ? " Eddie asked . " Nothing as romantic as all that , " Denne said . " The storm last night stirred the ocean . That ship must have gone down deep , some place cold enough to keep bodies from decaying , to keep clothing intact . " " And the ocean spits them back up , in the same place ? " Eddie asked . " I do n't think so . " " Oh , I do , " Denne said . " A certain kind of tide must bring them out of that place . Something that happens during storms , maybe , or the storms " interaction with what 's left of the Rock . Every now and then the conditions are right , and the sea returns a body . " " I suppose you believe in mermaids too , " Bishop said . His words were slightly slurred , his tone odd , almost hopeful . Denne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police chief . Dyston sabotaged the yacht , killing everyone on board except himself . " " How would the chief know that ? " Retsler asked . " Because the lifeboat made it to shore , rope cut , boat empty . Because all the lifesavers made it too , also empty . Because a passing fishing boat saw the boy jump over the side while the party was in full swing . It looked to them like the yacht was in trouble but no one seemed to be noticing . " " Little vague , I think , " Retsler said . " No more vague than mermaids , " Denne said . " You 've been holding out on me , " Retsler said . " Maybe . " Denne stood , and put a twenty on the table . " Or maybe I made this up to justify my presence in this sleazy little bar . Goodnight all . " He shoved his hands in his pockets and picked his way carefully around the wooden tables . None of the other patrons even seemed to notice him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Eddie said , looking at Lucy . " You knew about it . " Lucy nodded . " My mom kept all the clippings . " " So why 'd he kill them ? " Eddie asked . " Because he was a drifter , " she said . " Because he was marrying June for her money . " " Seems to me you do n't kill the golden-goose , " Retsler said . " You do when Daddy reveals your secrets at what should have been your night of triumph , when he humiliates you in front of what must have seemed like the whole world . " Retsler shook his head . " Sounds to me more like June had cause to kill Dyston . " Lucy grinned . " Do n't look at me . I 'm just telling you what the papers said . Me , I 've always believed in the mermaids . " " They 're not saints either , " Bishop said , and passed out . CHARLES WOKE UP in his own bed , cold and fully clothed . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had gotten drunk , and he had vowed not to . The sound of running water in the master bath made him sit up , hand to head , trying not to moan . At first he thought the toilet was running , but the sound was too bathtub-like , too full . Someone else was in the house . Visions of Daryl Hannah in Splash , himself as an aging Tom Hanks , made him realize that he was watching too many videos , substituting books and movies for human companionship . His life had enough drama . Of course someone else was in the house . Someone had brought him home . Besides , it could n't be mermaids . They rarely came into his house . He only knew of them doing so once . The night Grace died . Still , as he stumbled to the bathroom , he could n't shake the image of them as he last saw them , looking not lanky and graceful , not the seminaked beauties of Disney animation or with the erotic suggestiveness of Yeats . Instead they reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eyes that were flat , features rough-hewn , hair plastered to misshapen heads . Their land legs had feet as big as flippers . The mermaids walked as if they were in pain - Hans Christian Andersen had gotten that much right-but that could have been as easily caused by the huge feet as " daggers through the flesh . " So when he entered the bathroom , he was startled to find it empty . The tub was dry , and the toilet was n't running at all . Not even the faucet in the sink was dripping . But he had n't dreamed the sound . It continued in the plumbing like a garrulous ghost . He went down the stairs to the guest bathroom and found it empty too . The kitchen was as spotless as he had left it , and the washer was off . No water running anywhere in the house . Then he looked outside . Down the hill from him , the sea glowed with its strange luminosity . A few clouds blew across the moon , but there was no rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the mermaids . Not even Dan Retsler had enough guts to go to the Sandcastle at night . But after he dropped off Bishop  --  fireman-carried him , actually , upstairs and into bed-he stopped at the bottom of Bishop 's hill and stared at the hotel . The moon was full and the ocean shone , as it always did at night , as if someone had lit it up from underneath . The natural light , combined with the street lights , made the west side of Highway 101 as bright as dawn , when the shadows were just receding from the land , replaced by the whitewash of early morning . The Sandcastle did n't look like a mansion . But it did n't look like a hotel , either . It was three stories high , rectangular , and had doors every ten feet that faced the highway . The balconies were made of metal , which were beginning to look red from rust . The rest of the building was a bright peeling blue . Someone had added fake turrets on either side- if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cardboard-and the word " Sandcastle " was painted across one of them in white gothic script . What kind of man would build a mansion like that ? What kind of heirs would sell it ? Beachfront property was rare on the Oregon Coast , rare and expensive , while the rest of the land was cheap . He could n't imagine what that land would have gone for in 1936 , or why , despite the bodies , it still had n't sold in 1997 . The turrets , he imagined , were an addition , as were the balconies and the doors , added in the tourist-boom of the 1950s . He could n't , for the life of him , see the original shape of the building , how all the pieces had once fit together into an elegant whole . He was n't certain why that was important , but he would wager Denne had an idea . Denne , with his stories about tides and deep cold and bodies remaining preserved for sixty years . Denne , who clearly believed none of it . Laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded his car . Tall women , with strawlike hair , and the ugliest faces he had ever seen . They had bulging eyes , naturally pursed lips , and nearly flat noses . Fish women , he thought , and shuddered . He 'd had too much to drink . They leaned on his hood , peered into his windshield and laughed at him . Their gray-green eyes were the color of the sea on stormy mornings , their skin the same sallow bloodless white of the corpses he 'd found on the beach . " Hey ! " he shouted . " Hey , get away from the car ! " But they did n't . They moved closer , like people peering into a fish tank . He slapped at the windshield , and when they still did n't move , he punched the horn , quick and loud . The women jumped away , startled . The one on the hood rolled off , unable to catch herself . Her friends disappeared in front of the car , then reappeared in his headlights clutching her and staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he were a threat . He tapped the hom one more time , and they backed away from the front of the car . He turned north on 101 , hands shaking , mouth dry . It was n't until he had reached the movie theater a mile away that the realization hit him . The women had n't just been ugly . They had also been naked . CHARLES WOKE after a restless night 's sleep , filled with dreams of running water and bloated , decaying bodies . His head pounded , and his stomach churned . The sour taste of gin and tonics coated his tongue . He sat up , one hand to his head , wondering why he 'd let Retsler talk him into going to the False Colors . He knew better than to drink . When he drank , he forgot , and when he forgot ... He threw the covers back and stood up , startled at the sudden chill on his legs . His silk pajama bottoms were missing . His upper thighs were coated with sand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He got out of bed quickly , his heart pounding . Maybe he and Retsler had gone down to the beach after they left the bar . Maybe he had put on his pajama top and had forgotten his bottoms . Maybe , but not likely . The house smelled of brine . And he thought of Grace , feeling that same sickly stab of guilt he always felt when he thought of her . She had remained trim into her midfifties . Silver hair capping her well-shaped head . Every morning she went down to the beach , the entire beach , legends be damned . Every morning . Including the last . He closed his eyes and tilted his head back , restraining an anguish so deep he had no words for it . He should have known . He should have known yesterday when the body appeared on the beach . He should have known he would awaken like this . He had known , and he had ignored it , preferring the company of friends to the silence of the house . Knowing that only drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe he had allowed himself to get drunk . Because he did n't have the willpower to say no . " I 'm sorry , Grace , " he whispered . " Sorry for everything . " But sorry would never ever be enough . " Okay , " Lucy said . " This is what I got . " She dumped three scrapbooks with black construction paper and cardboard covers on Retsler 's desk . The smell of stale cigar smoke and mildew rose from them . He pushed his copy of the Oregonian aside . No newspaper this morning , no surveying the street . These deaths were bothering him , Denne 's comments bothering him even more . And the three women from the night before , they too had haunted him during his pitifully short sleep . He had awakened annoyed , his body aching , as though he had been interrupted in the middle of an erotic dream . Only he had n't found the women attractive , nor the dream in the least way sexual . " Dan , " Lucy said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her voice snapped him out of his reverie . He was n't a teenager anymore . He really needed a full night 's sleep . " No , " he said . " No , I 'm going to look . " He smiled at her , and took the notebooks . He was wrong about the material on the covers . It was n't a cardboard and construction paper combination but something that felt like both of them and neither at the same time . The scrapbooks were bound with a thick gold string . " Well , do n't rip nothing , " Lucy said . She picked up his newspaper and went back to her desk . He opened the first notebook carefully . The front page of the local weekly , the News Guard , from 1936 flapped at him . The paper was brittle and was held in place by tape so yellow it nearly looked brown . Beneath the page , in small black script , someone had written : Accident at Whale Rock . At first , he did n't read the articles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire notebook . When he reached the end , he realized that this was more than a curiosity to Lucy . She had been six when the accident happened . Someone else had kept the notebooks and passed them on to Lucy in later years . He almost asked her whose notebooks they had been . Almost . He was n't ready to hear . He needed to study the clippings first . The first notebook held only clippings from the News Guard . The second notebook held clippings from papers as diverse as The Oregonian and The New York Times . The death of J. William and his friends sent a ripple through the national financial community , a ripple that became evident almost immediately . J. William was an old-time fiscal conservative , with ties all over the Northwest . He had fought the bids for dams on the Columbia . He had fought the arrival of federal money into Oregon . He had lost the battles twice , but during the spring of 1936 , he was working against Roosevelt , against the New Dealers , and against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , if he had n't lost , the Pacific Northwest would have looked completely different . No public funds would have supported the Bonneville Power Administration . No defense contracts would have flowed to Seattle . The money would have stayed with J. William Brooks and his friends . The national papers called the destruction of the yacht murder . And some papers claimed that Lester Dyston was part of a larger conspiracy . The conspiracy of the New Dealers to rid themselves of the conservative Northwest factions , the friends of J. William Brook . The papers claimed the trial , its mockery of justice , and its result proved the conspiracy , but nothing was ever done about it . None of those facts made it to the News Guard . The local paper focused solely on the issue of mermaids . Charles took a long hot shower . Steam rose around him as he washed off the sand . He had hidden the seaweed in toilet paper and flushed it , never wanting to look at it again . Then , when he was done , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stall , pausing for a moment at the tiny bathroom window with its view of the sea . The morning ocean was multicolored : the front section a steely blue , the middle a solid gray , and the section near the horizon golden where the sun broke through the clouds . Gulls sat on the roof of the Sandcastle as they always did , but none dove , none circled , none flocked . He swallowed and leaned his head against the cool glass , cursing the day he had bought the house . The day after he and Grace had moved in , they had showered together , then stood before this window , marveling at their luck . That afternoon , they had walked to the beach and he had found a bottle with a half torn label that read Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1924 , covered with seaweed and still chilled from its days in the ocean . Pulling it out of the sand had reminded him , even then , of that scene in Notorious where Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant watched as Claude Rains poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the bottle , but Charles had not . He had taken it , thanked the ocean for her gift , and brought it to the house . They had wine with their fresh halibut dinner that night . Grace had taken one sip and declared the wine vinegar , but he believed her palate was off . It was , quite simply , the best wine he had ever tasted , and he drank the entire bottle himself . That night , after Grace fell asleep , he had wandered drunkenly down to the beach . He had later told her he had blundered into the surf , and she had scolded him for his carelessness , made him promise to never do so again , afraid he would die from exposure or drowning or his own drunken stupidity . But he had lied to her . He had not touched the water . His memory , his dreams , were of a song as fine as the wine , the ocean singing , he had thought , and he had followed that sound to the Sandcastle , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , and he followed the lights through the open doorway into a polished oak hallway and a magnificent staircase covered with a red carpet . A mirror covered the wall on the first landing , and he saw himself as he thought of himself , a slim middling handsome man in his early twenties , looking young and bewildered in the soft light . He wore a tuxedo of a type he had never had in real life , complete with spats , tails , and a top hat . The outfit gave him a dignity he had never had before . The music carried him upstairs into the open door of a darkened bedroom . As he stepped inside , a woman with cool hands touched his face , removed his hat , and he thought , started to undress him , until he realized that the hands below belonged to another woman . The second woman unbuttoned his fly and took him in her mouth . Her lips and tongue were cool and refreshing , and he was instantly more aroused than he had ever been in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to participate , and when he was naked , she guided him to the bed . The second woman continued her fellatio , and as they eased him onto the velvet spread , he felt the presence of a third woman . He was getting hard remembering . He groaned and pulled away from the window , hand on the wall to steady himself . His memory of that night was of mouths all over him , cool mouths , caressing him like rain . And when he came - and he did come , in powerful pulsing spasms , more powerful than anything he had experienced before - it felt as if his essence were flowing outward and joining a vast ocean of sensation , like a river flowing into the sea . The next morning he had awakened in his own bed , covered with seaweed and sand and tiny bite marks that looked like the circles left by octopus suckers . He knew that the circle marks would be on him this morning , but he had n't looked . He could n't face it , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night before . He had touched the women only once , and had felt hair like straw and skin like scales . From that moment on , he had let them do to him whatever they wanted , allowing his hands to be held captive while they marked him with their mouths . The experience was never as erotic as the first time . The first time he had thought it all a drunken dream and later when he realized it was real and he was being unfaithful to Grace , his mind rebelled and his body was unable to stop . Then , after Grace died , he had stopped drinking , and the women had stopped visiting . Except for last night . Except for last night , and a handful of sloppy self-pitying nights when the loneliness was so bad that a touch , any touch , even their touch was preferable to none . His penis throbbed . He glanced down at it , poking out from the towel . Red circles flared against the hardened skin . Red circles the size of a dime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the contents down . He grabbed himself and began masturbating , letting the memory of the night return , knowing that this was the only way to rid himself of it , and of the self-loathing that came with it , the self-loathing that grew worse each time . Each time Grace 's killers summoned him , and he went , valuing the ecstasy they gave him more than life itself . Retsler rested his chin on his hands , staring at the two-page spread from the News Guard in December of 1937 . Dyston 's trial had been held in Newport , and it had drawn people from all over the world . The grainy , poorly reproduced photographs made the tiny courthouse look as if it were under siege : a Simpson-esque circus long before O.J. Simpson was even born . The paper dutifully reported the case until the day Dyston testified . And then the paper had reprinted the testimony , using ellipses and editorial comments in brackets as it cut out sections it deemed unworthy for a family newspaper . Retsler could n't believe what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same yellowing newsprint , if the same brittle tape were n't holding the pages in place , he would have thought Lucy was playing a trick on him . Even then he was n't entirely sure . " Luce ! " he shouted . She set down her cigar and stood with a dignity foreign to her . She had been listening to the pages turn , waiting for just this moment . And somehow that thought unnerved him . She came inside his office and closed the door . They were the only two in the building . Closing the door seemed unnecessary . " He testified about the mermaids ? " he asked , his tone deliberately ironic . " You 're reading the transcript , " she said . Her expression was guarded , her voice flat . She used this tone with dumb tourists - " tourons , " she called them . Tourist-morons . " Tuxedos ? A gift of wine from the sea ? Destroying his one true love ? He was delusional . " " He was telling the truth , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been allowed to testify , " Retsler said . He closed the notebook . " No wonder the national press was so angry that he was acquitted . He should have at least been institutionalized . I do n't know how a jury could have let him off . " " They were a jury of his peers , " she said softly . She was serious , more serious than he 'd ever seen her . She believed this too , although he did n't know why . A small shiver ran down his back , raising goosebumps on his flesh . And for an instant , those naked women flashed through his mind , their mouths pressed against his windshield . Their tongues had a suction cup on the tip , leaving small dime-shaped impressions on the glass . " That 's nonsense , " he said , as much to her as to himself . She took the notebooks and hugged them to her chest . She studied him , the reserve gone . " Have you taken any gifts from the sea ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those are n't gifts , " she said . " They 're warnings . " " Of what ? " She shook her head , more serious than he had ever seen her . " I wish I knew . " AFTER HIS SECOND SHOWER of the day and a meager meal of tea and dry toast , Charles made his way down the rickety steps into his wine cellar . He was n't feeling well : dizzy , hung over , and angry at himself for being weak yet again . He could n't believe that Grace would forgive him if she knew - his sins had gone long past forgiveness . All he could hope for now was that death was truly an oblivion , and not that all-knowing , all-seeing place some religions made it out to be . A cobweb brushed against his face as he stepped onto the thin carpet . The cellar was cooler than the rest of the house and smelled faintly damp , the effects of living on the coast . Bottles of wine shone in the light from a single bulb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't touched it since she died . But he still knew where the bottle was . He had kept it , a compulsion he had , like all the others since he 'd come here . Compulsions he had n't tried to deny . He did n't know why he was trying now . Perhaps there truly was , as some people said , a last straw . And perhaps it was tiny , a small thing unmeasurable by real world standards . Perhaps . Or perhaps he had been planning this since the first time he knew the women were real , and he had finally gained enough courage . Or perhaps he finally realized he had nothing to lose . He rounded the corner , and grabbed the bottle from its bin . The bottle was made of thick glass . The torn label was still there-funny that neither he nor Grace had commented on that , considering how long they had thought the bottle had been in the water - and the bottle felt full , even though he knew he had polished it off on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking somehow that the bottle alone would be worth money , not knowing , instead , it would cost him his soul . He clutched the bottle to his chest and headed out of the wine cellar . He would grab his coat and go to the beach . To the Sandcastle . Alone . The Glen Ellyn Lodge stood atop a cliff face overlooking the ocean . Behind the lodge was one of the most spectacular private golf courses in the nation , and beside the fairways stood the homes of Whale Rock 's rich . Retsler hated going there . He thought the fact that it was a gated community appropriate to its attitudes , its snob appeal , its closedmindedness . But he parked in the lot reserved for guests and went inside the seventy-year-old structure , knowing he would find Denne in its dining room , surrounded by Whale Rock 's elite , and staring down at the ocean . The lodge was decorated like an English country manor , in dark woods , with hunting greens and browns on the carpet and upholstery . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room came the sound of soft voices and the clink of glasses . The maitre d ' , a man Retsler had gone to high school with , raised a single eyebrow . " Business , " Retsler said , and slipped by . He turned the comer and stepped into what he considered to be the most spectacular room on the Oregon Coast . The greens and browns continued in here , but they were nearly invisible compared to the view . The architect had let the ocean speak for itself . The walls were made of paneled glass , with only the water and the sky visible on all three sides . It felt as if a person was outside , without the wind and the chill and the hint of spray rising from the surf below . Denne sat alone at a comer table , cigarette in one hand , glasses on the end of his nose , peering at the Wall Street Journal . Retsler crossed the room , ignoring the other patrons who surreptitiously watched him , and sat across from Denne . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Retsler asked . Denne folded his paper , removed his glasses and set the cigarette in a cut glass ashtray . " Hello , Dan , " he said as if Retsler had n't spoken . " Would you like a cocktail ? Or perhaps a bit of lunch ? " " Mermaids , " Retsler said . He was exhausted and not in the mood to be civil . " Of course I knew about them , " Denne said . " I told you about them when I told you about the Lady June . " He had lowered his voice and leaned forward as he spoke . " You knew about Dyston 's testimony ? About the idea that mythical creatures trashed the entire yacht in order to have him to themselves , to get rid of the competition ? " " I find it amazing the man was not committed , " Denne said . He picked up his cigarette . " Now , if you 're not going to have lunch , then let me get back to my paper . " Retsler put his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says other locals have seen the mermaids . " " You 're local . Have you ? " Denne asked . The three women surrounding his car rose in his mind . He swallowed . Denne 's small , superior smile faded . His face drained of color . " Have you ? " he whispered . " I saw three strange women last night . I had just poured Charles home . They were at the base of the hill . " " On land . " Retsler nodded . " And did you hear anything odd or unusual ? " " No , " Retsler said . Denne let out a small sigh . " You believe Dyston 's story , do n't you " Denne gazed out the window . The sea crashed and boomed against the rocks below , the sound loud over the hushed voices around them . " My father talked of them , " he said softly . " After my mother died . He killed himself , you know . " " No , I did n't know . " Denne 's smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . He drank too much , blamed himself for her death . He sent me away , made me promise never to come back . " " But you did . " " Of course . " " And you believe in the mermaids ? " Denne took a deep breath , and met Retsler 's gaze . " I do n't go to the beach alone . Neither does my wife . And on nights when the moon is full , I sleep with the windows closed , with earplugs in both ears , and the stereo on . " Retsler frowned . " Because of mermaids ? " " Because of the mermaids , " he said . In the daylight , the Sandcastle looked like a gothic ruin . Its blue paint was peeling , and the fake facades were crumbling . Vandals had broken through the plywood over the windows , revealing the wide staircase from Charles 's dream/vision . The carpet was rotted , the mirrors smashed , and the stairs rotted through . He shivered just looking at it . Charles clutched the bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel 's beach access . High tides had broken the stone steps , and the metal rail added decades ago had rusted through . He went down the steps gingerly , one hand on the stone wall for balance . The sea was loud here , louder than anywhere else on the coast . He remembered remarking on that to Grace the night they had come down , the night they had found the bottle . He had noticed it again when he found her body almost a year later . He knew why they had taken her . Just the night before he had spoken to them , told them he had someone else , someone he loved , and that he wanted them to leave him alone . He had left , thinking he was safe . The next morning , the gulls had circled , and he had found Grace 's body , lying in a tidal pool near the edge of the Sandcastle Hotel . Denne had ruled it accidental , death by drowning , and there was nothing to prove otherwise . Nothing except Charles 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time they encircled him and made him theirs . The wind was cool and damp . It carried small grains of sand that pelted him as he stepped out of the protection of the stairwell . This section of beach was completely deserted . Not even a gull sat at the water 's edge . The sand was thin , revealing the thick black lava rock beneath . Only the ocean seemed alive , booming and cascading along the rocks with more energy than he had ever had . He used to think of the ocean as a vast desert . It always made him marvel at the ancient sailors " ability to navigate such a broad and empty expanse . He had wondered , early in his enchantment , how the mermaids did the same . He doubted they used stars , and he wondered about the consistency of the ocean bottom . It was n't until he realized that the bodies turned up on shore the very day the mermaids would summon him that he knew what happened . The mermaids lived near the Sandcastle , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a calling card . There was no calling card today . Only him , the ocean , and the broad expanse of sky . He scrambled onto the rocks , his feet slipping on the wet sand . The bottle grew heavy in his arms . He had to get close to the water . He was not as strong as he used to be . With his right hand , he grabbed the bottle by its neck and picked a spot farther out , a spot where the ocean was almost black , and threw with all his strength . The bottle spun in the air , its brown sides catching the light , winking at him . He wished , at this moment , that he could see in black and white . This part of his life needed to be like a noir film , all darkness and shadows , with the light shimmering high and out of reach . Then the bottle hit the water and disappeared into the darkness . He waited a moment , to see if it would surface , and it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through him . He let out a sigh , turned and scrabbled along the rocks . The ocean boomed behind him , and a thin wave , nearly gone , wrapped itself around his shoes . Hands gripped him from behind , scaly hands , clawlike hands , and hair coarse as straw blew across his face . Now he knew why he 'd been thinking of death all day , why he had made this choice at this moment . He had never had enough courage to do things on his own . He had always needed help . He turned , and for the first time ever , returned the mermaids " embrace . AS RETSLER DROVE back to Whale Rock , he could n't shake a feeling of unease . Denne 's words kept circling through his mind . Mermaids and fear . Too many people taking such a preposterous thing so seriously . He needed to talk to Bishop , to see why he had mentioned them the night before . But as Retsler crested the rise near the Sandcastle , he saw gulls . Hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandcastle was nearly blanketed with them , and with all the falling feathers , the neighborhood looked as if it were buried in snow . He picked up the radio . " Luce , " he said . " Any call from Bishop ? " " No , " she said . " Should there have been ? " " We have gulls at the Sandcastle . Send Eddie down , would you ? " " And the coroner ? " she asked . He took a deep breath . " I 'll let you know . " He clipped the receiver back onto the radio and drove into the turnout . His blue Taurus slid on the gravel before stopping . He had been driving too fast . As usual . He got out , heart pounding . He was n't used to being alone on this stretch of highway . The gulls were thick . He was n't sure he 'd be able to get down to the beach without Eddie 's help . Retsler reached into the back seat and removed his bullhorn . He had n't brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He promised himself he would n't get too close . He walked along the narrow footpath and down the stairs . The gulls covered the beach like a blanket - too many for him to approach . But he did n't need to . The corpse was leaning against the rock retaining wall , body intact except for the missing eyes . A single gull stood on the corpse 's wet hair , but the others kept their distance , as if showing Retsler the kill . The kill . His friend . Charles Bishop . Clearly and irrevocably dead . Retsler felt bile rise in his throat , and he swallowed , keeping control as best he could . He had taken Bishop home the night before , he knew he had . Besides , Bishop was dressed differently . Bishop had come down here , alone , for no apparent reason at all . Retsler backed away , never taking his gaze off the birds . One false move and they would swarm him too . It was n't until he reached the narrow footpath that he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the False Colors . She was afraid he would go home and brood . He did n't know how brooding in public was any different from brooding alone , so he went along . He sat in a dark corner of the bar , listening to Lucy chatter about the day 's silliest events . Eddie nursed a long-neck and listened as well . It felt as if they had lost one of their own . Retsler could n't get Bishop 's body from his mind , the mocking position it had been left in . Just as his wife 's had been . And the last thing Bishop said before he passed out at this very bar the night before . He was talking about mermaids . He 'd sounded wistful . As if he knew . " Dan ? " Lucy 's voice was soft , as if she 'd been trying to reach him more than once . " We can talk about Charles if you like . " He did n't like . He took a sip from the local stout and shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood beside Denne during the autopsy , saw all the evidence . Bishop had drowned . Just like his wife had . Denne ruled it accidental death , but he said he could have ruled suicide just as easily . There was nothing Retsler could do , and that galled him even more . He drained his third pint of stout and stood , a bit more unsteadily than he had thought he would . " Dan ? " Lucy asked . " Going home , " he said . " I 'll drive you . " He shook his head . She 'd had more to drink than he had . " I 'll walk . " He grabbed his windbreaker and swung it over his shoulders , then went out the bar 's back door . The night was clear , the stars dabbed across the heavens like spots of white in black velvet canvas . The cool salty air refreshed him just enough , and he followed the footpath down to the beach . The False Colors was nearly four miles away from the Sandcastle , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach home numerous times without a twinge . But this time , when he reached the deep brown sand farthest from the ocean , his heart did a double-flip . The salty freshness had changed . There was another smell here , a bitter , biting scent that he associated with death . His stomach flipped again and he winced . Tonight he would have to find another way home . He turned , and his boot hit something hard in the sand . He peered down , expecting a rock , and seeing instead a bottle filled with liquid . " Damn tourists , " he said , and swept it up , realizing as his fingers touched it that the bottle was old and still damp from the sea . Its label was tom in half , and in the light from the beachfront hotels he could just parse out some French words , and a date : 1924 . Wine , old and expensive . He grinned . He would give it to Denne . Denne liked expensive things . Retsler tucked the bottle under his arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back of his neck stood on end . He removed the bottle once more , and looked at it , heart pounding . An expensive bottle of wine . Bottled before 1936 . When the Lady June went down . This was another gift from the sea . A benign one , perhaps , but still a gift from a tragedy best laid to rest . Besides , how did a wet bottle appear in dry sand ? Tourists , he thought again . Or mermaids . And what if they existed ? What if , after he took their gift , he could hear their song ? And what if it lured him , like it had lured Dyston ? He had no girlfriend to drown . But he had friends . So many friends . God , he was drunk . He would never have believed these thoughts sober . He staggered back down the path until he reached the sand . He slogged through it , reaching the water 's edge . A black spot the size of a child 's wading pool proved a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness . The bottle landed in the inky spot with a splash . Concentric circles flared outward . A cool breeze touched him , and for a moment he felt suddenly sober . Too sober . Then the surface of the water smoothed , and his mouth went dry . A woman rose out of the darkness . She had bulging eyes and a flat nose . Her long wet hair flowed along her neck and shoulders like seaweed . She clutched the bottle against her large breasts . All the light from the area seemed focused on her . Her white skin seemed even whiter against the dark backdrop of the sky and sea . When she saw him , she smiled . The smile was benign , almost questioning . She held out the bottle , as if he had n't understood the invitation . He shook his head . He had seen the results of gifts from the sea and he wanted no part of it . But he was so aroused his body hurt . How did that happen ? He thought she was the ugliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " No . Thank you , but no . " Her smile faded . She sank beneath the water as if she had never been . With her went his arousal , and in place of it , he felt a vague unease in the pit of his stomach . A wind whipped up . Waves the size of trees formed at the inky spot and headed toward shore . He backed away , never taking his gaze from the ocean , until his feet hit the footpath . Then he started to run . Gulls dive-bombed him , cawing as they swooped near his face . He covered his eyes , and bowed his head , peering through his fingers as he negotiated the path . Things brushed his hair , and droppings fell all over him . He let one hand fall to his side , slid the other arm across his eyes , and reached for his service revolver . He grabbed it and shot skyward , the bang startlingly loud . The cawing stopped . The rustle of wings disappeared . He sat abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers the color of stars . He had never seen a gull at night before . A chill ran down his spine , and he remembered some movie he had seen as a kid , a Hitchcock movie about birds going out of control , attacking for no reason . It had terrified him , that movie , because those birds seemed like real birds , their behavior as cold and inexplicable as the sea . The gulls were gone . He was alone , covered in bird droppings and feathers , and feeling shaky . He had refused . He had refused the gift from the sea . And the birds , the woman , they had been angry at him , but they had n't hurt him . They had n't touched him . He had survived the curse , something Dyston had n't been able to do . Something , Retsler suspected , his friend Bishop had n't been able to do either . " God , Bishop , " he whispered , " if you 'd only talked about it . " But Retsler would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have believed unless confronted with it himself . Mermaids did hunt along the beach . And they were as natural as birds , plucking eyeballs from the dead .
