Why Are Diaper Services Disappearing ? // Call the numbers of the three diaper services listed in the Boston , Massachusetts Yellow Pages and you 'll get the same message : " The number you have called is not in service at this time . " Ten years ago , the disposable diaper was the soiled symbol of a throwaway culture ; today , it 's the cloth diaper that has , well , bottomed out . Over the last few years , diaper services in the Boston area have shut their doors , leaving parents who prefer cloth scrambling for alternatives . Boston is far from unique-what 's happening in the Northeast is representative of a nationwide trend . According to the National Association of Diaper Services ( NADS ) , the 400 diaper businesses that thrived in the late 1980s have dwindled to about 50 today . For years , people automatically assumed that plastic-and-paper disposables did more damage to the environment than reusable cotton diapers . By1990 , the 20th anniversary of Earth Day , many states were considering legislation to tax or ban disposable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service industry reached a high of $200 million . In the Boston area , 16 competitors flourished ; the biggest , Dydee Diaper , tripled its business in less than three years . Facing a decline in market share , disposable companies launched an advertising blitz questioning just how " green " cotton diapers were , from the pesticides used to grow the cotton to the volume of water used to wash them . Procter &; Gamble , makers of Pampers and Luvs , set the debate in motion when it ran an ad showing tree roots in compost , and a voiceover stating : " Ninety days ago , this was a disposable diaper " ( After several lawsuits based on the fact that there were no composting facilities for disposables , Procter &; Gamble pulled the commercial . ) But the damage had already been done . By 1997 , Dydee , along with three quarters of the nation 's diaper services , had folded its last diaper . " Disposables spent millions of dollars trying to muddy the waters , " says Brian Smithson of NADS . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without the capital to buy billboards or pay for TV commercials . Larry Martin , manager of the familyowned Tidee Didee in Portland , Oregon , says he 's never been able to afford advertising , and he adds that if his father-in-law did n't own the business , he 'd have to close up . " We 've been able to absorb the loss of business , " he says . " Others have n't been so lucky . " Today , the disposable makers saturate the airwaves , hyping drier , more sanitary and more convenient products . Besides , washing diapers is a messy business , and without services to do the dirty work , many advocates of cloth diapers find their resolve weakening . And new mothers , torn between the different options , are often " started off right " with free disposable diaper packs in the hospital maternity wards and nurseries . " I cleaned my own diapers because the service went out of business , and I couldnot imagine switching to disposables , " says Boston mother Michele Daves , who notes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) have never worn a plastic diaper . " But unless parents are personally motivated , this is n't a realistic alternative . " Crushed by the disposables monopoly , the cloth diaper industry has also been abandoned by the national environmental community . Once staunch defenders of reusables , conservation groups now argue that competing social and ecological concems make it difficult to evaluate the environmentally correct position . " We 've come to appreciate that downstream solid waste is only one of many public health and resource-use issues associated with diaper technology , " says Allen Hershkowitz , a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council . These include , says Hershkowitz , pediatric dermatology , adult incontinence , upstream resources , manufacturing impacts , an increase in women in the work force , and more out-of-home child care . Photograph The fleets of cloth diaper service trucks have been dwindling nationwide . In the last decade , diaper businesses have dropped from 400 to about 50. // In addition to life-cycle analysis studies , Hershkowitz acknowledges that a kind of eco-fatalism is responsible for the cloth diaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have on this issue ? " he asks . " Nine out of 10 Americans with children in diapers prefer disposable diapers . Trying to find ways to subsidize diaper services is probably not the best way for a professional environmental advocate to spend her or his time . " With friends like these , advocates of reusables are pinning their hopes on city and state officials who are alarmed at the enormous increase in disposable diapers as a percentage of solid waste in landfills . " We definitely think disposables are a problem , " says Peter Spendelow , a waste reduction specialist at the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality . " Think about all the attention that is given to plastics and bottle recycling . Well , there are now more dirty diapers in the landfill than rigid plastics combined . " In Seattle , disposable diapers increased from 2.5 percent of all residential waste in 1988 to 3.3 percent in 1994-1995 . In Portland , waste studies indicate that the number of diapers in the waste stream increased by 10 percent from 1992 to 1994 . Solid waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . The cities of Vienna and Munich now subsidize the cost of cloth diapers to offset costs incurred by municipal waste disposal , says Rick Froese , a cloth diaper manufacturer and exporter in Ontario , Canada . Since it costs hundreds of dollars for the cities to dump each ton of waste , notes Froese , " they save on the order of two tons of waste in the landfill site for every child who uses cloth , instead of disposables . " Encouraged by figures showing that cloth diaper use in parts of Austria has gone from almost nothing to 40 percent in the last few years , several diaper service operators hope to set up similar programs in the U.S. In conjunction with several nonprofit organizations , Smithson 's Baby Diaper Service in Seattle hopes to win a grant from Seattle Solid Waste to subsidize the cost of diaper service for low-income families . There is also some evidence that cloth diapers may be gaining favor with a new generation of parents . " For the first time in five years , our numbers are up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portland . And according to NADS , a couple of diaper services in the Boston area may soon rise from the ashes . Ultimately , however , like the triumph of formula over breast milk , the travails of diaper services reinforce the dominance of packaging , synthetics and big money in the baby care business . But eco-mommies and daddies should n't lose all hope . Ingenious entrepreneurs like Lyons Falls are already figuring out how to reclaim the fiber in used plastic diapers and make it into , of all things , recycled paper . <p>
