<p> Two major events occurred during 1969 . Neil Armstrong walked on the moon and in Hawaii , Greg Noll rode " 30-plus " Makaha . Most surfers reckon it was a toss up . <p> The giant surf during the winter of 1969 was the benchmark for big-wave riding and Noll is credited with catching the biggest wave of the epic swell . It was a quantum leap beyond " 25-plus " at Waimea Bay . <p> These are " island scale " measurements ; a combination of surfing lore and macho cool insists on cutting wave size in half . That 's just the way is . <p> A three-foot Hawaiian wave is , in truth , head-high on a six-foot surfer . Using that yardstick , it is conceded by all who matter that Noll spun his 11-foot yellow gun around and paddled into a lumbering wave with a 60-plus face . <p> In truth , Noll only reached the trough before being obliterated in an avalanche of whitewater . He almost drowned , but he made a statement on the largest wave ever attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armstrong 's small step in defining the outer limits of man 's achievement . During the past three decades , various paddle-in and tow-in efforts have challenged Noll 's feat but the gray mists above 30 feet are difficult to judge . <p> An act of God is hard to calibrate . Huge waves have been ridden on rare occasions , but none cleanly eclipsed that long-ago Makaha monster . <p> Until now . <p> On Jan. 28 on the North Shore of Oahu , Ken Bradshaw of Sunset Beach used a tow-in assist to ride a wave estimated at " 40-plus . " Go ahead and call it - an 80- , maybe 90-foot face . <p> The 45-year-old Bradshaw made the surreal wave , pulling out unscathed as the whitewater backed off in a deep channel two miles off the beach . <p> Perhaps the most remarkable part of the ride is that it began in Houston . <p> Bradshaw was born in Houston and learned to surf during the summer of 1967 at Surfside Beach , Freeport . He attended Johnston Junior High and Westbury High before moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 years , the Texan-turned-Hawaiian has been acknowledged as one of the premier big-wave surfers . Now , he is numero uno , the rider of the largest wave in the world . <p> " What Bradshaw accomplished out there . . . was beyond comprehension . He caught the biggest wave ever ridden on the North Shore . You 'd think that claim would trigger a furious debate , full of cynicism and outrage , but this time the vote seemed to be unanimous . " <p> Condition Black , Surfer , June 1998 . <p> " The big wave was only one of many I got that day , " said Bradshaw in a recent telephone interview . " I knew it was huge but I did n't realize how big until I saw some video that night . It was 10 times overhead and there was still plenty of water below the board . <p> " I signaled to go for the wave and my tow-in partner Dan Moore pulled me into position . When I let go , the drop took at least five or six seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went absolutely vertical - looking up , it was the most phenomenal thing I have ever seen . <p> " I climbed back up the face and made a cutback , then dropped back down and out onto the shoulder . Moore was right there to pick me up . " <p> No photographer with a " still " camera was able to get a shot of the benchmark ride , but the wave was witnessed by other tow-in surfers plus numerous onlookers from various video vantages on the beach . <p> The one wave clearly was the largest , but Bradshaw and the others rode several waves in the 35-foot class . <p> " It was the most incredible session I 've ever had , " he said . " The conditions were ideal - sunny , with moderate trade winds . I caught the big one about noon ; we came in , then went back out , and I nailed at least three others in the 35-foot range ( one of those is pictured on this page ) . <p> " In that one day I rode the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just my day . " <p> " Ken 's Day " occurred at a phantom reef known as Outside Log Cabins . The outside reef seldom breaks , and on the biggest swells . It might show once every few winters . <p> " I 've been watching Logs for years , " said Bradshaw . " It broke in ' 74 , ' 76 , ' 79 , ' 83 , and twice in ' 86 . Back then , before tow-in surfing had evolved , it was basically unsurfable . <p> " But , I knew it would be the ultimate tow-in spot . Other tow-in spots like Jaws on Maui , and Mavericks in Northern California , have a shallow shelf that reaches out ; when the surf gets over 30 feet , these place just overload . " <p> The North Shore has a series of reefs falling into deeper water and the outside reefs a mile or two off the beach will not close out even on the biggest swell . <p> " For Logs to even show , the swell has to be huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever before . Logs starts to show at about 25 feet but really does n't break until 30 , about the time that Waimea Bay closes out . It gets hollow at 35 and really goes off at 40 . How much bigger ? Who knows ? " <p> Bradshaw is confident that his board can handle a Size XXXXL upgrade . Surprisingly , not much has been made in the surfing media about the equipment used on the benchmark day . <p> Bradshaw , of Bradshaw Hawaii Surfboards , built the 7-10 , 17-inch wide , 2-inch thick tow-in boards specifically for Log Cabins . <p> " It 's longer than the 7-4s and 7-6s most tow-in surfers are using but I figured Logs would be a new realm . The board worked really well ; I believe I could have ridden at 5 or 10 feet bigger with no problem . " <p> Some traditionalists probably insist that an asterisk should be placed by Bradshaw 's big-wave mark . Using the assist of a personal watercraft ( such as a Jet Ski ) to intercept the incoming swell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . The issue might be academic . <p> " There is no way you can paddle into and successfully ride a 40-foot wave , " said the only man in the world with the first-hand experience to judge . <p> " For one thing , the playing field is huge - like Sunset Beach expanded . Outside Log Cabins is almost impossible to line up ; we tried paddling out back in the 80s and caught a few smaller waves but almost always were out of position when a big set came through . <p> " But , even if you were sitting in exactly the right spot , you can not get moving fast enough from a dead stop to pick up the swell and make the drop ahead of the whitewater coming down . <p> " It 's too thick , too fast , too much water to overcome . Even if you made the drop , the whitewater hitting the flat is moving faster than the board can move , and it 'll bury you . " <p> Is that what happened when Noll got annihilated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . He did everything right and just got swallowed at the bottom . Beyond 35 feet , it ca n't be done without a tow-in . " <p> The tow-in surfer uses the speed of the watercraft to get into position and to catch the peak of the fast-moving swell before it jacks to break . <p> Once the rider is flying down the face he drops the line and surfs the wave . He is at once alone , riding the thin line between glorious success and hideous failure that always has marked big-wave surfing . <p> The undeniable trump is the ability to make the drop and the initial turn before the Pacific Ocean falls out of the sky . The tow-in capability expands the horizon of surfing beyond the " cloud break " sets on the outside reefs . <p> The next giant swell , whenever it hits , may see Bradshaw 's mark broken . Or , maybe it wo n't . A lot of things must go exactly right , and only a few big-wave watermen truly are qualified to attempt the outer realm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Big Wednesday " when the horizon started to tilt beyond conceptual limits on the outside reef . He has devoted his life to riding big waves . <p> " Even in the beginning , back in Texas , the bigger days were the ones that turned me on , " said Bradshaw in a prophetic 1984 interview . " When the surf would get five or six feet we would walk out the Surfside Jetty and jump off the rocks . <p> " The drop , the bottom turn , the pressure - that 's what I was always looking for . That feeling was developed in Texas but I had to move on to bigger things . " <p> The entire surfing world now will agree that he found them .
