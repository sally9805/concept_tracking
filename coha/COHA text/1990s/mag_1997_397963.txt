WAS YOUR GRANDMOTHER RIGHT ? Headnote PSYCHOLOGIST ROBERT EPSTEIN , PH.D. , EXAMINES HOW THE PROVERBS WE 'VE PASSED DOWN FOR GENERATIONS MEASURE UP AGAINST DECADES OF RESEARCHAND FINDS THAT FOLK WISDOM IS N'T ALWAYS AS WISE AS IT SEEMS . // The table next to me at Fillipi 's restaurant was a noisy one . Two men and two women in their 20s and 30s were arguing about a relationship issue . One of the men-call him Male #1would soon be leaving the country for six months . Would the passion he shared with his beloved survive ? The exchange went something like this : Female #1 ( probably the girlfriend ) : " When you really love someone , being apart makes you care even more . If someone is good to you , you sometimes take that for granted when the person is around every day But when he 's gone , all that good treatment is gone , too , and you realize just how much you had . You really start to yearn for him . " Male #2 ( looking lustfully at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other woman ) : " That 's right . The same thing happens when your parents die . You really start to miss and appreciate them . You even rewrite the past , forgetting the bad things and focusing on the good times and the kindness they showed you . " Female #1 ( starting to look lovingly at Male #2 ) : " Exactly . Everyone knows that absence makes the heart grow fonder . " Then Male #1 , the one probably on his way to Thailand , spoke up . " Well , but . .. " He faltered , thinking hard about going on . All eyes were on him . He took a deep breath . And then he said , slowly and deliberately , " But do n't we also say , Out of sight , out of mind ' ' ? " This was not good for anyone 's digestion . Female #1 's face turned the color of marinara sauce . Male #2 smiled mischievously , presumably imagining himself in bed with Female #1 . Female #2 looked back and forth between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed together . And Male #1 , not wanting to face the carnage , lowered his eyes and tapped out a strange rhythm on the table top with his fork . Was he thinking about the classy Thai brothels he had read about on the Internet ? TRUTH OR POPPYCOCK ? " Absence makes the heart grow fonder " and " Out of sight , out of mind " are examples of folk wisdomfolk psychology , you might say All cultures pass along wisdom of this sort-sometimes in the form of proverbs ; sometimes through songs ( remember Paul Simon 's " Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover " ? ) , rhymes ( Mother Goose ) , or stories ( Aesop 's fables ) ; sometimes through laws and public information campaigns ( " Stay alive , do n't drink and drive " ) ; and always through religion ( " Do unto others as you would have them do unto you " ) . But folk wisdom is an unreliable , inconsistent kind of wisdom . For one thing , most proverbs coexist with their exact opposites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Does absence truly make the heart grow fonder , or are loved ones out of mind when they 're out of sight ? And is n't variety the spice of life ? ( If Male #1 had come up with that one , he might have been murdered on the spot . ) Do opposites attract , or do birds of a feather flock together ? Should you love the one you 're with , or would that be like changing horses in midstream ? We all know that he who hesitates is lost , but does n't haste make waste , and is n't patience a virtue , and do n't fools rush in , and are n't you supposed to look before you leap ? And , sure , money is power , but are n't the best things in life supposed to be free ? And since time is money , and money is power , and power corrupts , does that mean time also corrupts ? Well , maybe so . After all , the Devil finds work for idle hands . I 've only covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture passes along its own wisdom , which is not always meaningful to outsiders . In India , for example , people say , " Call on God , but row away from the docks , " and Romanians advise , " Do not put your spoon into the pot that does not boil for you . " In Bali they say , " Goodness shouts and evil whispers , " while in Tibet the message is , " Goodness speaks in a whisper , but evil shouts . " You get the idea . Proverbs that relay wisdom about how we 're supposed to live do not necessarily supply useful or reliable advice . In fact , proverbs are sometimes used merely to justify what we already do or believe , rather than as guidelines for action . What 's more , we tend to switch proverbs to suit our current values and ideals . A young man might rationalize risky action by pointing out that " You only live once " ; later in life-if he 's still around-he 'll probably tell you , " Better safe than sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we glean any truths at all from the wisdom of the ages ? The behavioral sciences can help . Science is a set of methods for testing the validity of statements about the world-methods for getting as close to " truth " as we currently know how to get . Psychologists and other scientists have spent more than a century testing the validity of statements about human behavior , thinking , and emotions . How well does folk psychology stand up to scientific inquiry ? What do we find when we test a statement like " Absence make the heart grow fonder " ? If , as I do , you sometimes rely on folk wisdom to guide your actions or teach your children , this is a question well worth considering . Here 's how five common proverbs measure up to behavioral research . CONFESSION IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL Psychologists do n't study the soul , of course . But , says psychologist James W Pennebaker , Ph.D. , " If we define " soul " loosely as who you are , how you feel about yourself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul . " Pennebaker , a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin , is one of several behavioral scientists who have looked carefully at the results of " self-disclosure " - talking or writing about private feelings and concerns . His research suggests that for about two-thirds of us , self-disclosure has enormous emotional and physical benefits . Pennebaker 's newly revised book , Opening Up : The Healing Power of Expressing Emotion , summarizes 15 years of compelling research on this subject . Self-disclosure , as you might expect , can greatly reduce shame or guilt . In fact , studies of suspected criminals showed that they acted far more relaxed after confessing their crimes-despite the fact that punishment now awaited them . Self disclosure may also provide the power behind talk therapy . " The fact that self-disclosure is beneficial , " says Pennebaker , " may explain why all forms of psychotherapy seem to be helpful . Whether the therapy is behavioral or psychoanalytic , in the beginning the clients tell their stories . " Perhaps most intriguing are the physical effects of " confession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system , spurring production of white blood cells that attack invading microorganisms , increasing production of antibodies , and heightening the body 's response to vaccination . But what about those other proverbs that advise us to keep our mouths shut ? " Let sleeping dogs lie . " " Least said is soonest mended . " " Many have suffered by talking , few by silence . " Can self-disclosure do harm ? According to Pennebaker , self-disclosure is not likely to be beneficial when its forced . University of Notre Dame psychologist Anita Kelly , Ph.D. , has suggested , moreover , that revealing secrets may be harmful if the confidant is likely to be judgmental . And a 1989 study conducted by Maria Sauzier , M.D. , of Harvard Medical School , showed that people often regret disclosures of child abuse . Sauzier found that nearly half of the parents whose children had disclosed sexual abuse ( usually to the other parent or a therapist ) felt that both the children and the families were harmed by the disclosures . And 19 percent of the adolescents who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In general , however , confession seems to be a surprisingly beneficial act . ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK A DULL BOY To me , the most frightening scene in the movie The Shining was the one in which actress Shelley Duvall , concerned that her husband ( jack Nicholson ) was going crazy , approached the desk at which he had spent several months supposedly writing a novel . There she found hundreds of pages containing nothing but the sentence , " All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy " typed thousands of times on a manual typewriter . I 've always wondered who did all that typing ! And I 've also wondered about the truth of the proverb . Once again , we 're also faced with contradictory bits of folk wisdom that urge us to work until we drop : " Rest makes rusty . " " Labor warms , sloth harms . " " Labor is itself a pleasure . " Is too much work , without the balance of leisure activity ( " play " ) , actually harmful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one possible exception : if you love your work-in other words , if you 've been able to make your avocation your vocation-then work may provide you with some of the benefits of play In the 1940s , anthropologist Adam Curle pointed out that the distinction between work and leisure seems to be an unfortunate product of modern society . In many traditional cultures , he wrote , " there is not even a word for work . " Work and play " are all of a piece , " part of the integrated structure of daily living . But modem society has created the need for people to earn a living , an endeavor that can be difficult and can easily get out of hand . Hence , the modem pursuit of " leisure time " and " balance " - correctives for the desperate measures people take to pay their bills . Study after study confirms the dangers of overwork . It may or may not make you a dull person , but it clearly dulls your mind . For example , recent research on fire fighters by Peter Knauth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and lower alertness . And studies with emergency room physicians show that overwork increases errors and impedes judgment . Indeed , a Hollywood cameraman , coming off an 18-hour work shift , made news recently when he lost control of his car and died in a crash . Conversely , leisure activities have been shown in numerous studies by researchers Howard and Diane Tinsley , Virginia Lewis , and others , to relieve stress , improve mood , increase life satisfaction , and even boost the immune system . Curiously , the hard-driven " type A " personalities among us are not necessarily Dull Jacks . According to a recent study of more than 300 college students by Robert A. Hicks , Ph.D. , and his colleagues , type-A students claim to engage in considerably more leisure activities than their relaxed , type-B counterparts . Type As may simply live " more intensely " than type Bs , whether they 're on the job or goofing off . The distinction between work and play is , to some extent , arbitrary . But it 's clear that if you spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , your performance , health , and sense of well-being will suffer . BOYS WILL BE BOYS The widely held ( though politically incorrect ) belief that boys are predisposed from birth to feel , learn , and perform differently from girls is strongly supported by research . For example , boys are , on average , considerably more aggressive than girls . They are left-handed more frequently than girls and tend to be better at math and at spatial rotation tasks . Girls , meanwhile , may perform certain kinds of memory tasks better . They also start talking earlier than boys , and , at the playground , they 're more likely to imitate boys than boys are to imitate girls . And boys tend to listen more with their right ear , while girls tend to listen with both ears equally These findings generally hold up cross-culturally , which suggests that they are at least somewhat independent of environmental influences . Upbringing plays an important role in gender differences , of course-even in the first days after birth , parents treat boys babies differently from girls-but converging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many gender differences are actually programmed from birth , if not from conception . Since the brain is the mechanism that generates behavior , where we find behavioral differences , we should also find neurological differences . Indeed , recent research suggests a host of differences between male and female brains . For example , although , on average , male brains are larger than female brains , the hemispheres of the brain seem to be better connected in females , which may help explain why females are more sensitive and emotional than males . Behavior is also driven by hormones . Here , too , there are significant gender differences . From birth , testosterone levels are higher in males , which helps to account for males ' aggressiveness . June Reinisch , Ph.D. , then at Indiana University , studied boys and girls whose mothers had been exposed to antimiscarriage drugs that mimic testosterone . Not surprisingly , she found that these children of both sexes were considerably more aggressive than their counterparts with normal testosterone levels . But even among the exposed children , the boys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be boys ( and , by implication , girls will be girls ) . But this is only true " on average . " Male and female traits overlap considerably , which means that a particular male could be more emotional than most females and a particular female could be better at math than most males . To be fair , you have to go case by case . EARLY TO BED , AND EARLY TO RISE , MAKES A MAN HEALTHY , WEALTHY , AND WISE This proverb , often attributed to Ben Franklin , actually seems to have originated in the late 1400s , and Franklin may have lifted it from a collection of adages published in 1656 . Historical trivia aside , research on sleep suggests that the proverb gives sound advicebut only because our culture is out-of-synch with the biology of nearly half the population . Here 's how it works : it 's long been known that the body has natural rhythms . Those that occur on a 24-hour cycle are called " circadian " and include cycles of temperature change , wakefulness , and eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change . This much you probably have heard , but what you might not know is that there are two distinctly different circadian rhythm patterns . " Larks " - who show what researchers call " morningness " ( honest ! ) - are people whose cycles peak early in the day . Not surprisingly , larks awaken early and start the day strong . " Owls " - people inclined toward " eveningness " - peak late in the day . In both cases , the peaks are associated with better performance on memory tasks , quicker reaction times , heightened alertness , and cheerful moods . Some people are extreme larks or owls , others are moderates , and a few fit neither category There 's a problem here , especially if , like me , you 're an extreme owl . The trouble is that many important human activities-business meetings , job interviews , weddings , classes , and so on-are conducted during daylight hours , when larks have a distinct advantage . Not surprisingly , owls spend much of their time griping about how out-of-synch they seem to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ph.D. , and Michael H. Bonnet , Ph.D. , of the University of Florida , paints a grim picture for people like me : " Larks reported waking up when they expected to , waking up feeling more rested , and waking up more easily than the owls . " Larks also reported having " fewer worries " and getting " more adequate sleep , " and they awakened feeling physically better than owls . The differences were even greater , moreover , when owls tried to adapt to the lark sleep pattern . What 's more , these problems can impair not only owls ' sense of restedness but also their bank account ; a study of Navy personnel suggests that people who sleep well make considerably more money than people who sleep poorly . The long and short of it is that if your biorhythms allow you easily to " go to bed with the lamb and rise with the lark " ( another old proverb ) , you may indeed end up with more money , better health , and more life satisfaction-but only because your internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE ROD AND SPOIL THE CHILD A recent headline in my local newspaper proclaimed , " Spanking Backfires , Latest Study Says . " I cringe when I see stories like this , because I believe they ultimately harm many children . People have come to confuse discipline with " abuse , " which is quite a different beast . " Discipline " - whether in the form of " time outs , " reprimands , or spankings-is absolutely necessary for parenting . Extensive research by psychologist Diana Baumrind , Ph.D. , and others , has shown that permissive parenting produces children who ca n't handle independence and are unable to behave in a socially responsible manner . A great many social problems that we face today may be the inadvertent product of a generation of well-meaning , misinformed , overly-permissive parents . However , if all you provide is discipline , without affection and emotional support-the " authoritarian " parenting style-you can damage your children . Offspring of authoritarian parents tend to be hostile and defiant , and , like the victims of permissive parents , they too have trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high level of discipline and ample affection and support . That 's the best approach for producing children who are self-reliant , socially responsible , and successful in their own relationships , research shows . In the latest anti-spanking study , published in August by University of New Hampshire sociologist Murray Straus , Ph.D. , children between the ages of 6 to 9 who were spanked more than three times a week displayed more misbehavior two years later . Does n't this show that spanking causes misbehavior ? Not at all . Correlational studies are difficult to interpret . Perhaps without those spankings , the kids would have been even worse off . It 's also possible that many of these spankings were unnecessary or excessive , and that it was this inappropriate discipline that sparked the later misbehavior . Conversely , at least eight studies with younger kids show that spanking can indeed improve behavior . The age of the child , in fact , is probably important . Children under the age of six seem to regard spanking as a parents right . But older kids may view it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spanking 's effects may not be so benign . Punishment , verbal or physical , applied in moderation and with the right timing , is a powerful teaching tool . It should not be the first or the only tool that a parent uses , but it has its place . TRUTH A LA CARTE But what about the restaurant debate ? Does absence make the heart grow fonder or not ? Alas , not enough research has been conducted to shed much light on this question . We do know that " out of sight , out of mind " is true when we 're fresh from the womb ; young babies will behave as if a toy has vanished into thin air when the toy is moved out of sight . But our memories quickly improve . Research conducted by Julia Vormbrock , Ph.D. , and others , shows that children grow more fond of their caregivers when they 're separated from them-at least for a few days . After two weeks of separation , however , most children become " detached , " reports Vormbrock . Psychologist Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation , and two-thirds said that " absence makes the heart grow fonder " seemed more true than " out of sight , out of mind . " A poll , however , does n't tell us much about the truth of the matter . To settle things , we 'll need an experiment . Hmmm . First we 'll need 100 couples , whom we 'll give various tests of " fondness . " Then we 'll assign , at random , half of the couples to a Control Group and half to an Absence Group . Next we 'll separate the partners in each couple in our Absence Group by , say , 1,000 miles for six months-somehow providing jobs , housing , and social support for every person we relocate . Finally , we 'll readminister our fondness tests to all 100 couples . If we find significantly greater levels of fondness in the separated couples than in the unseparated couples , we 'll have strong support for the idea that absence makes the heart grow fonder . Any volunteers ? What ? You would never subject yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one would ever conduct such research , either . And that 's the bottom line : the behavioral sciences can provide useful insights about how we should lead our lives , but there are limits to the kind of research that can be conducted with people . Folk wisdom may be flawed , but , in some instances , it 's all we 've got or will ever have . So do n't put all your eggs in one basket .
