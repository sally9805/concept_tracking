// " This is a movie to embrace . It 's about people who are complicated but decent , who are optimists but see things realistically , who are fundamentally comic characters but have three full dimensions . It is about a Middle America we rarely see in the movies , yes , but it 's not corny and it does n't condescend . Movies like this are hardly ever made at all ; when they 're made this well , they 're precious cinematic miracles . "  --  Roger Ebert The greatest cycling story ever told turns 20 When Breaking Away premiered 20 years ago , few expected much from this little $2.4 million flick filmed in six weeks in Bloomington , Indiana , starring a bunch of young no  --  names like Dennis Quaid and Daniel Stern . A movie featuring , uh , bike racing ? Swell concept , guys . Let 's put it on a double bill with a film about tiddlywinks . But somehow it clicked . Produced at a time when cycling was even more disrespected in America than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard for this story of a working-class Hoosier teen so smitten with bike racing that he starts talking Italian , singing arias and calling the family cat Fellini instead of Jake . Superbly acted and written , Breaking Away earned five Academy Award nominations for 1979 ( including best picture ) and won the Oscar for best screenplay . The movie 's success also opened Hollywood 's eyes to the potential of independent films . It even spawned a shortlived TV series , which ran for eight episodes in the ' 80 season and starred teen heartthrob Shaun Cassidy as Dave . Not bad for a film that 20th Century-Fox nearly axed during the production process and whose pre-release title , Bambino , prompted Stern 's parents to ask if he 'd landed a role in a porno flick . In case you 've been living under a rock for two i decades , Breaking Away chronicles a summer in the lives of four blue-collar friends fresh out of high school in the university town of Bloomington : Dave Stohler , Italian bikeacer wannabe ( Dennis Christopher ) ; Mike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stern ) ; and diminutive but tough Moocher Jackie Earle Haley ) . Dave and his buddies are breaking away from childhood , from their parents ' expectations , from the limits imposed on townie kids who live in the shadow of wealthy students-expatriates who deride the locals as " cutters , " after the stonecutters in the fading limestone quarries . Along the way , Dave stumbles into a sweet romance with a coed who thinks he 's an Italian exchange student ; competes against his beloved Italians in a 100-mile race that smashes his illusions ; and baffles his father , the used-car salesman . " He 's shaving , " a stunned Mr. Stohler tells his wife . " His legs . He 's shaving his legs . " It all climaxes with Indiana University 's annual Little 500 bike race  --  which screenwriter Steve Tesich and his teammates won in ' 62-where Dave and his friends take on the privileged frat-boy world they 've been battling their whole lives .

Finally , somebody from the outside got cycling right-did n't trivialize it , did n't over-dramatize it , did n't screw it up entirely . It 's part of the story line , part of people 's lives . Sure , the character who rides is a little off-kilter-his passion a little too fierce and weird for those around him  --  but they got that right as well . You need to be slightly twisted to be a bike addict . Early in the movie , when Dave learns Italy 's renowned Team Cinzano is coming to race in Bloomington , he knows he must train like never before . One day he rides 50 miles out of town and waits for a semi ( a Cinzano truck , naturally ) to come by . Dave jumps in its draft and pedals furiously , quickly hitting 60 mph . He and his gleaming orange Masi glide as one through the lush , rolling Indiana farmland .

That 's too much to ask of a movie , even a great one . We 'll settle for this : Somebody finally got cycling-and its interplay with other stuff , like life-right . Sure , many of us were riding bikes for years before the movie came out-but Breaking Away made cyclists of us all . WHERE ARE THEY NOW ?

PAUL DOOLEY ( Mr. Stohler ) : Dooley had played Christopher 's father in the ' 78 film A Wedding .

EDDY VAN GUYSE ( Team Cinzano bad guy ) : Van Guyse was a bike racer and winner of the Little 500 when he auditioned for the role .
