Champions are born , not made . And new tennis star Alexandra Stevenson is a champion in the truest sense of the word . She is the daughter of a champion-NBA great Julius " Dr. J " Erving . Photograph Alexandra Stevenson became an overnight tennis champion when she set records at Wimbledon . Her famous father , Julius " Dr. J " Erving , was a champion on the basketball court when he played with the Philadelphia 76ers from 1976 to 1987 . Erving recently acknowledged that he is her father . // She recently won international attention when she made history at Wimbledon in England-the same day that Dr. J revealed to the world that he is indeed her father . The new 18-year-old champion handled herself with grace and ease on and off the tennis court . She won with grace and eventually conceded graciously her loss to Lindsay Davenport . Photograph // Again with grace , she refused to comment when asked by reporters at a post-tennis match conference if Erving was her biological father . " I just focus on my tennis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said before Erving made his statement . " I 'm oblivious to most of it . I have n't been reading any newspapers , just playing tennis . " And she indeed played tennis . She made history at Wimbledon by becoming the first qualifier to reach the women 's semifinals . Only one man , John McEnroe in 1978 , has reached the semifinals as a qualifier since qualifying competition began in 1925 to include a few players not selected for the main draw . Stevenson served 15 aces at speeds of up to 113 mph in a 6-3 , 1-6 , 6-3 victory over Jelena Dokic . Two hours later Erving , who initially denied that he is her father , said reports that he is her biological father are true and he has been supporting her financially ( JET , July 19 ) . Stevenson 's mother , Samantha Stevenson , is a White freelance journalist who worked in Philadelphia when Erving starred there for the 76ers . She has written many times about her efforts to raise her daughter to be a champion . " What makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennis article in 1987 . " Red Smith ( the late New York Times sports columnist ) once told me it 's in the blood . I agree . A world-class athlete is born with the ability to be great . Alexandra has it . You do know if your child 's got it . " Alexandra Stevenson was 9 in 1990 when Martina Navratilova won Wimbledon for the last time , and she heard someone ask Navratilova if there ever would be a great serveand-volleyer like her again . " She said there is some 9- or 10year-old that is going to be coming up , " Stevenson said . " I was watching it , and my mom was in the bedroom , and I said , Hey , mom , that 's me . ' I really thought it was going to be me . It 's great that it 's kind of coming true .

" I understand they are being besieged because she won her match today , " Erving said . " Getting this statement out will help . " Erving also said , " I am pleased to see Alexandra , at 18 , doing so well , and I applaud her mother 's efforts and courage . " Erving has four children with his wife , Turquoise . They married in 1972 . Neither the tennis star nor her mother , Samantha , made any comment about Erving 's being Alexandra 's father . " No comment ever , " Samantha Stevenson said . " I 'll go to my grave with it . " The issue came up when The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel newspaper in Florida published a copy of Stevenson 's birth certificate that lists her father as Julius Winfield Erving IIDr . J 's formal name . Erving initially denied he was Stevenson 's father after the story came out . Alexandra 's mother , Samantha , stirred Wimbledon since the start of the tournament with accusations of racism and lesbianism on the tour and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6-1 , 6-1 to Davenport . Afterward , the gracious champion , who lost with a smile , said in the Sunday Telegraph , " I have experienced the glory of Wimbledon . Now I might persuade the flight attendant to upgrade me to business class on the way home and be able to buy my mother a washing machine . I 'd like my own Volvo convertible , but I think I 'll have to wait until later on to get that . " She added , " I have learned a ton here , but I am going to work on my serve and work on holding my serve and work on my serve and volley and become a better attacker . I am going to work on the business of finishing inside two sets , instead of going out there and playing great , then losing focus and then playing great again .
