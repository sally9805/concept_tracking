<p> Saturday <p> Astros 6 , Giants 5 <p> Things lined up the way the Astros had envisioned back in the heady days of April and May . They hit three home runs , got a strong starting pitching effort from Greg Swindell and a saving relief performance from Doug Jones . <p> The result was a victory over the Giants before 46,316 at Candlestick Park . It was n't easy , but after losing seven in a row to the Giants , the feeling in the clubhouse after the game was nearly euphoric . <p> The Astros jumped on Scott Sanderson , making his first start for the Giants after losing nine straight games and being released by the California Angels , for three home runs and six runs in six innings . <p> Swindell , making his second start since coming off the disabled list with a strained left shoulder , took a one-hitter and 6-1 lead to the seventh inning . <p> It looked like an easy win for the Astros against the Giants . But not as long as Barry Bonds is around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut the lead to 6-4 . <p> In the eighth , the Giants closed to 6-5 off Xavier Hernandez and Al Osuna . <p> On came Jones , who has pitched his way back into the closer 's role he had in April but lost in June . Up came Matt Williams and Bonds . <p> Jones struck out Williams with a fastball  --  of all things  --  and got Bonds to bounce out on a changeup , the pitch that Jones has relocated in the last three weeks . Since the All-Star break , Jones has six saves in as many chances . <p> For the Astros , the big innings came in the fifth and sixth . After Eric Anthony hit a screaming line-drive home run off Sanderson to start the second inning , the Giants pulled even in the fourth on a triple by Dave Martinez and sacrifice fly by Will Clark . Before the triple , Swindell had retired the first 10 Giants . <p> Craig Biggio 's two-out single up the middle in the fifth gave the Astros a 3-1 lead . <p> The Astros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> First , Jeff Bagwell led off with his 17th home run . After Anthony walked , Ken Caminiti hit his first homer since June 6 . That was all for Sanderson , who now has a 10-game losing streak spanning two leagues and two months . <p> For Swindell , this game was more along the lines of what he was supposed to do for the Astros . He retired 18 of the first 19 batters he faced and pitched without pain . <p> Sunday <p> Astros 4 , Giants 1 <p> Mark Portugal continued his mastery of the Giants with victory to raise his career record against them to 10-3 . <p> The game was not without its tense moments , however . In the fourth inning , after Portugal struck out Giants third baseman Matt Williams , he shouted , " " Yes , " and pumped his fist in the air . <p> It did n't seem like a huge display of emotion , but Williams was furious . He screamed at Portugal after going back to the dugout . Perhaps Williams ' 3-for-39 career output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a small celebration after the strikeout . <p> " " I consider that he showed me up , " said Williams . " " I do n't show anyone up on the field , and I do n't expect anybody to show me up . If I hit a home run off him , I would n't jump up and down . <p> " " But I expressed my opinion on the field , and there will not be any payback the next time we face each other . I 'll just try to get a hit off him . " <p> Portugal said Williams ' outburst did not surprise him . <p> However , he insisted he was not trying to stir up anything . <p> Jeff Bagwell gave the Astros a 1-0 lead in the first inning when he hit a fly ball to left off Giants starter Bryan Hickerson ( 5-4 ) that carried 344 feet and just cleared the fence . <p> It was Bagwell 's 18th homer of the season , matching his career best , set last season . The homer was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's total . <p> Scott Servais hit a 429-foot bomb to dead center in the second inning to make it 2-0 . Steve Finley hit another homer in the eighth off reliever Jeff Brantley , and Andujar Cedeno 's RBI single gave Jones added insurance . <p> Portugal 's key inning was the fifth . He took the 2-0 lead and a one-hitter into that inning , when the first three Giants reached on singles . <p> Only one run scored , and that on an infield out . Left fielder Luis Gonzalez made a game-saving catch of Will Clark 's drive to left field to end the inning . <p> As has been the case most of the season , Portugal avoided the big inning . It 's one of the big reasons he has won five straight games and is 11-4 , tied with Darryl Kile for the best record on the Astros ' staff . <p> Monday <p> Astros 5 , Padres 4 <p> With runners on first and third and one out in the 10th inning , pinch hitter Luis Gonzalez got down a perfect bunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astros a victory at San Diego . <p> Earlier , Anthony hit a two-run homer and the Astros led 4-1 after six innings , but the Padres tied the game on home runs by Derek Bell and Phil Plantier . <p> Anthony led off the 10th with a single off Trevor Hoffman ( 3-4 ) . One out later , Eddie Taubensee 's single moved Anthony to third , setting up Gonzalez 's safety squeeze bunt down the third-base line . Anthony slid in just ahead of the throw from third baseman Archi Cianfrocco . <p> Xavier Hernandez ( 3-2 ) , who gave up a game-tying homer in the eighth to Plantier , survived a ninth inning that nearly sent the Astros to another typical loss in San Diego . <p> Hernandez struck out leadoff hitter Cianfrocco on a pitch in the dirt . The ball bounced so high off catcher Taubensee that Cianfrocco reached first base . <p> After a sacrifice by Billy Bean , Hernandez threw another wild pitch that allowed pinch runner Craig Shipley to get to third . <p> Kevin Higgins was hit by a pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end the inning . <p> Doug Jones pitched the 10th inning for his third save in three games , the first time he has done that this season . One of the reasons for that is that winning streaks by the Astros have been scarce . <p> The Astros ' three-game winning streak matches their longest since June 6 . This is the fifth time they 've won three in a row since then . On the season , their longest winning streak is five games . <p> The Astros led in the early going , 3-0 and 4-1 with Anthony 's first-inning homer off Tim Worrell the big blow . <p> In each of Worrell 's last three starts , the Padres had scored 11 runs . But because he had allowed 13 hits , 13 walks and 14 runs in 16 1/3 innings , Worrell was around for only one of the victories . <p> He got two quick outs in the first inning Monday , but Jeff Bagwell bounced a single up the middle and Anthony worked the count full . <p> The 3-2 pitch might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's career , headed perhaps for the scoreboard in deep right-center field . <p> But the ball hit a guide wire that runs from center field and supports the foul pole in right field . It fell back onto the field , first base umpire Wally Bell signaling that Anthony had a two-run homer , his 12th of the season and third in the last four games . <p> Astros starter Pete Harnisch held a 2-0 lead through the early going , though not without some worrisome moments . <p> The Padres put two runners on base in the first , but Plantier hit into an odd , inning-ending double play . His line drive was dropped by second baseman Craig Biggio , who recovered in time to throw to second and start the double play . <p> After two more singles in the San Diego second , Harnisch got Brad Ausmus to hit into a double play to end the inning . <p> Two singles in the third inning had Padres on first and third with two outs , but Plantier flied out to end that threat . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Harnisch and Biggio started the inning with singles , and Kevin Bass ' bunt moved them into scoring position . <p> Harnisch came home on Bagwell 's grounder to short . He would have been an easy out , but catcher Ausmus dropped the throw and Harnisch was safe . <p> Ahead 3-0 , Harnisch gave back a run in the fifth when he walked pinch hitter Tim Teufel , threw a wild pitch and gave up an RBI single to Gardner . <p> Harnisch had thrown 77 pitches through five innings and struggled throughout , so when the Astros had a two-out chance to increase the lead in the sixth Howe used Chris Donnels to hit for Harnisch . Donnels ' RBI double off reliever Kerry Taylor made it 4-1 . <p> Al Osuna took over , and his troubles continued . He hit Plantier with a pitch and gave up a two-run homer to Bell that quickly turned this into a one-run game . <p> Tuesday <p> Padres 7 , Astros 2 <p> After being drubbed by the San Diego Padres at Jack Murphy Stadium , Doug Drabek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legendary loser Anthony Young of the New York Mets . <p> In addition , Drabek ( 7-14 ) is tied for the major-league lead in losses with Milwaukee 's Bill Wegman and Minnesota 's Scott Erickson . <p> He lasted only four innings against the Padres , giving up nine hits and seven runs . Three of those runs were unearned as the Astros made three errors and added an element when Drabek is on the mound . Not only do they not hit ; they do n't field . <p> This loss halted a three-game winning streak for the Astros , who were beaten by Andy Ashby , who was 0-6 with an 8.19 ERA in 22 games before winning for the first time since April 1992 . Ashby went a career-best eight innings and struck out a career-high nine Astros . <p> Tony Gwynn had three hits in four innings against Drabek . The Padres scored five runs on seven hits in the third and fourth innings , putting away the game . <p> The first inning was indicative of the way things have gone this season for Drabek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he trailed 2-0 by the end of the inning . <p> Craig Biggio and Kevin Bass led off the game with singles , hardly surprising considering Ashby had allowed 103 hits in 67 innings with Colorado and San Diego entering Tuesday 's game . <p> After Jeff Bagwell and Eric Anthony struck out , Ken Caminiti walked to load the bases . Luis Gonzalez hit what looked as if it would be the first grand slam of his career , a shot to dead center that sounded like a homer and left the bat like one , too . <p> But center fielder Derek Bell had other ideas . Bell raced to the wall , leaped over the top and brought Gonzalez 's would-be homer back into the park . Gonzalez stopped at second base in disbelief , staring at Bell . <p> Drabek got two quick outs in the Padres ' first before Gwynn lined a rising double that got over the head of right fielder Bass , who did n't look particularly graceful on the play . Drabek walked Phil Plantier before the Astros started their circus act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle that Biggio got in front of but did n't catch . The error made it 1-0 . The Padres then pulled a double steal , with Plantier coming home safely ahead of Biggio 's return throw . Bell injured his right thumb diving into second base and left the game in the next inning . <p> Doubles by Biggio and Bagwell cut the Padres ' lead to 2-1 , but Drabek gave back two runs in the bottom of the inning . Gwynn got a second life when Caminiti overran his pop foul behind third base , and reached base on an infield single . <p> Plantier continued his home-run binge . He hit his second in two games and eighth in the last 12 games . He has 23 homers in his first season in the National League . <p> Wednesday <p> Astros 9 , Padres 6 <p> A would-be pitchers ' duel turned into a home-run derby as the Astros continued their power surge with three homers in one inning off San Diego 's Andy Benes . <p> Behind 6-3 , the Astros scored five runs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Andujar Cedeno and a three-run blast by Eric Anthony . <p> The Padres had built their lead off Darryl Kile with a grand slam by Billy Bean in the third inning , only the fourth homer of Bean 's career . <p> The last time the Astros hit three home runs in one inning was July 24 , 1984 , when Enos Cabell , Phil Garner and Jose Cruz hit consecutive home runs off Mark Davis , then with San Francisco and now with the Padres . <p> The Astros smacked seven hits and scored eight runs off Benes and got an unlikely victory for Kile , who snapped a personal three-game losing streak and improved to 12-4 with his first win since July 21 . <p> The main source of power on the trip has been Anthony , who has four home runs and nine RBIs . Anthony also made a diving catch in right field in the eighth inning that prevented the potential tying run from reaching scoring position . Doug Jones pitched the final two innings for his 22nd save , his fourth on this road trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something was n't right for Benes came when the first three Astros reached base and two scored before the first inning was over . <p> Craig Biggio walked , Steve Finley singled , and Jeff Bagwell walked to load the bases with none out . <p> Biggio scored on Anthony 's infield out , and Finley came in on Ken Caminiti 's sacrifice fly to make it 2-0 . <p> A missed call by veteran umpire Harry Wendelstedt helped the Padres get back one run in the first . After the first of five walks by Kile , Tony Gwynn singled . <p> Phil Plantier lifted a fly ball to deep center that Finley caught and then dropped as he was transferring the ball from his glove to his throwing hand . <p> Wendelstedt ruled that Finley never had possession and had dropped the ball , bringing Howe out of the dugout for a spirited discussion . <p> Wendelstedt , stationed at first base , would not ask another umpire for a second opinion , and the bases were loaded . <p> A run scored on an infield single by Guillermo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down 6-2 to Benes , the Astros were handed a run in the fourth when Bagwell singled , went to second on a wild pitch , to third on an infield out and scored on Benes ' third wild pitch of the game . <p> Thursday <p> Astros 5 , Padres 3 <p> It took a reduction in the San Diego Padres ' payroll of nearly $ 20 million from April to August , some of the best pitching luck Greg Swindell will ever run into and Doug Jones ' fifth save in six days , but the Astros won a season series in San Diego for the first time since 1986 . <p> Behind five shaky innings by Swindell and four good ones from the bullpen , the Astros beat the Padres to win the season series 4-3 in San Diego after going 10-44 at Jack Murphy Stadium from 1987-92 . <p> " " We did n't make it easy , but we won some games here , " said Swindell ( 8-9 ) . " " Every game was a struggle , it seemed , but it 's better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the Astros everything they could handle . Casey Candaele , getting his first start since July 4 , was 2-for-3 with two doubles and three RBIs . In 69 previous at-bats this season , Candaele had two RBIs . <p> The Padres had 13 hits but left 14 runners on base , nine in scoring position , as Swindell won his second in a row . Two of his eight wins have come in San Diego , though neither will go down as a work of art . In 10 1/3 innings against San Diego , Swindell allowed 18 hits and 10 runs . <p> This game , Swindell gave up 10 hits but was able to come up with enough outs with Padres on base to leave with a 4-3 lead . With Swindell in the game , the Padres left 10 on base , seven in scoring position . <p> The Padres went ahead 1-0 in the first , but that run was n't Swindell 's fault . With two out , Tony Gwynn hit a rising line drive that left fielder Luis Gonzalez broke in on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derek Bell hit a routine grounder that third baseman Ken Caminiti booted as Gwynn scored . <p> Swindell pitched around a single and an error by shortstop Andujar Cedeno in the second , but the Padres got four hits and two runs in the third inning . With runners on second and third and two out , Swindell made too good a pitch to Archi Cianfrocco , who went 3-for-3 against Swindell . <p> Cianfrocco lined a two-run single past Caminiti to put Padres rookie starter Scott Sanders ahead 3-0 . Sanders , making his second major-league start , was five starts removed from an outing for Class AAA Las Vegas against Tucson , the Astros ' affiliate . In that game July 16 , Sanders gave up 11 hits and six runs in four innings . <p> Though Sanders walked four batters in the first three innings , the Astros did n't have a hit until Jeff Bagwell led off the fourth with a double . He was on third with one out , but Caminiti flied to shallow center and Gonzalez bounced out . <p> Swindell , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in the fifth . And for the first time , he helped himself with his legs . After a single by Cedeno , Swindell poked an opposite-field single to right to raise his average to .225 . <p> Candaele lined a shot into the gap in right-center that rolled to the wall before Gwynn chased it down . Cedeno trotted home , and so did Swindell . Problem was , Swindell was n't trying to trot . He chugged home from first base and nearly collapsed into the arms of Steve Finley , the next batter . <p> After Candaele 's hit , Finley singled , and Bagwell 's infield grounder scored the tying run . The Astros took the lead on a leadoff triple by Gonzalez in the sixth off reliever Trevor Hoffman . Cedeno 's fly to center was deep enough to bring home Gonzalez . <p> Swindell was lifted for a pinch hitter later in the inning and turned the slim lead over to the bullpen . On this trip , that was money in the bank . The relievers pitched 23 1/3 innings in seven games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones continued his excellent pitching with one shutout inning . He has not allowed an earned run in his last 16 2/3 innings . Xavier Hernandez worked two scoreless innings before Doug Jones saved his fifth game of the road trip and 23rd of the season . <p> Friday <p> Rockies 5 , Astros 3 <p> One out away from his sixth save in the last seven games , Doug Jones could n't put away the Rockies as he gave up a three-run homer to Charlie Hayes in the ninth inning that lifted the Rockies over the Astros before 37,972 in the Astrodome . <p> The expansion team is 6-1 against the Astros this season , with Jones taking three of the losses . <p> In 3 1/3 innings against Colorado , Jones has allowed 12 hits and nine runs ( 24.32 ERA ) . <p> Before this game , this had been a week of resurgence for Jones . He saved each of the Astros ' victories on a 5-2 road trip , re-establishing himself as one of the top closers in the league . He had converted 10 straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 20 1/3 innings before Hayes ' 18th homer of the season . <p> The Astros took a 3-2 lead into the ninth inning after a two-run homer in the fifth by Craig Biggio , whose power this season came mostly in the first half . <p> Biggio 's home run was his 14th , a career best . <p> Through three innings , Astros starter Mark Portugal used every bit of the Astrodome and all of center fielder Steve Finley 's range to keep the Rockies from scoring . With a runner on first base in the second , Finley made a leaping catch of Joe Girardi 's line drive in the gap in right-center . <p> With a runner on first in the third inning , Finley raced to the warning track to chase down Daryl Boston 's drive . <p> The Rockies took a 2-0 lead in the fourth on three straight singles , but that was all Portugal allowed in six innings . <p> Rockies starter Mo Sanford struck out five of the first 10 batters he faced . He allowed no hits and one walk the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often the case with young pitchers , subsequent trips through the order were not as easy . <p> The Astros got one run back in the fourth on Eric Anthony 's two-out double  --  the first hit off Sanford  --  and Luis Gonzalez 's single up the middle . <p> In the fifth , Biggio 's homer put the Astros up 3-2 . Todd Jones pitched two shutout innings before Doug Jones came on and was rocked .
