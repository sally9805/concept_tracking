<p> Some football stars look to God for athletic inspiration . Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre puts his faith in fiber optics . <p> With his team battling the Minnesota Vikings late last month , the laser-armed quarterback scanned a series of photo-faxes on the sideline . The pictures , taken moments earlier , showed a hole in the Vikings ' defensive secondary . Favre quickly processed the data and zapped a pass to his receiver on the cutting edge of the end zone . <p> Aided by a new breed of cybercoaches and a host of digital devices , plugged-in players like Favre are scoring touchdowns with technology every week in the National Football League . <p> A brutal game filled with carnage , combat and collisions , the NFL 's smash-mouth sport has taken big bytes and swallowed a dose of Silicon Valley sophistication . And as it moves toward the millennium , the USA 's new national pastime , born among meat packers and autoworkers nearly 80 years ago , increasingly resembles a bump-and-run version of computerized chess . <p> Baseball has PC-toting managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , basketball coaches churn statistics on laptops and golfers boom big drives with titanium clubs . <p> But no sport utilizes as much state-of-the-art technology as pro football  --  from expensive , nonlinear video editing equipment to encrypted coach-to-quarterback radio transmitters to pulsating pain relief appliances run by microprocessors . <p> " In every business , company and corporation , people are trying to get the edge with technology today , " says Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan . " Football is no different . " <p> Investing in high-tech does n't guarantee a Super Bowl , but , says Bill Levy , president of software provider About Sports , " if both teams are equal , the team with the information will win . " <p> Adds Dusty Alves , video director for the San Diego Chargers : " There 's no way to even survive in the NFL without the use of some computer-generated program . The amount of technology that goes into winning in this league is amazing . " <p> The NFL 's high-tech blitz has unleashed a heated debate among team executives over pro football 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control each game 's outcome in the 21st century . <p> Given a choice , even the most techno-savvy NFL coaches would prefer a lightning-fast running back to a blazing Pentium chip . A speedster who can burn 40 yards in 4.3 seconds , says Chargers coach Kevin Gilbride , " is much harder to find . " <p> At the same time , a number of NFL traditionalists seem determined to contain pro football 's digital onslaught . <p> George Young , the New York Giants general manager and a member of the NFL 's influential competition committee , has no problem with teams using computers to prepare for games , but he wo n't allow PCs after kick-off . Young also wo n't permit coaches to have on-field radio contact with linebackers , even though quarterbacks are hooked up . <p> " We 're not Neanderthals by any means , " says Young . " We want to take advantage of technology , but we do n't want to totally robotize the game . We do n't want it to be a game of who has the best computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced scouting software to the NFL a generation ago , rival teams barely broke a sweat . <p> Indeed , the early technology was clunky and cumbersome . <p> And if the Cowboys wanted an up-to-the-minute read on a game in progress back then , they had to snap Polaroids , mount them on cardboard and analyze them in the locker room at half-time . Coaches in those days also spent hours poring over grainy 16 millimeter game films . When the film broke , it oftern was repaired with duct tape . <p> The situation is n't as sticky today . <p> NFL teams are pouring millions of dollars into computerized video systems that expose their opponents ' flaws and weaknesses in a nanosecond , before they even take the field . <p> The Green Bay Packers ' set-up , which rivals NASA 's Mission Control with its banks of tape monitors and computers , is one of the NFL 's most advanced technology operations . <p> The $ 300,000 system , which runs on Apple Power Mac computers , is anchored by Avid Sports software and hardware . Assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches simple answers to their most complex questions . <p> If the team 's defensive coordinator wants to know what plays a rival runs on second down and five , for example , or the offensive coordinator needs to see how well an opponent defends against a draw play on third and eight , the Avid Sports system will spit out a customized report and video tape based on recent games . <p> Mike Holmgren , the Packers ' head coach , uses the Avid Sports package to monitor his own team 's performance . <p> " I use it every day , " says Holmgren . " As we play games , I can pull out very quickly what we 've done . Like how successful we 've been on third and three . Or how has a specific play really worked ? " <p> The Packers ' Avid Sports system stores 32 football games and uses 300 gigabytes of memory , the capacity of 60 of the hottest new home PCs . <p> Ten other NFL teams use Avid Sports products , according to Dave Grandin , the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Bill Gates . <p> The Detroit Lions are one of the 10 , and earlier this season technology helped them upset the Packers . <p> Analyzing second and long situations , the Lions coaches noticed that whenever the Packers spread their running backs a certain way , they threw a screen pass . The information led to a key interception in Detroit 's big win . <p> " You 're a better coach with the computer , " says Gary Stevens , offensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins . " It tells you how ( opponents ) think . " <p> The photo-fax , a $ 1,500 VCR-like box made by Sony and Mitsubishi , also provides important strategic insights by delivering nearly instant pictures of the 160 plays that occur in a typical NFL game . <p> " Things are going so fast on the field for the quarterback , and he 's got three guys on top of him , " explains Alves . " But when he comes to the bench , you show him the prints . Then he sees the openings and can exploit an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and end-zone , adds Shanahan , allow a team to " respond immediately , a big plus when you 're calling the plays . " <p> Offensive line <p> And the plays are transmitted electronically , from the coach 's headset to a receiver nestled in the padding of the quarterback 's helmet . <p> To prevent the messages from being intercepted , each play is electronically encrypted ; words are scrambled at the sideline and unscrambled once they reach the quarterback . <p> If used efficiently , the Control Dynamics coach-to-quarterback radio allows more than just play-calling . <p> Andy Reid , the Packers ' quarterback coach , usually tries to squeeze in one last pointer before the radio automatically turns off 15 seconds prior to the snap of the ball . <p> First , Reid will relay Holmgren 's play to Favre : " Bob Sweep , " for example , which will send the running back scampering around the end . <p> Then , Reid will tell Favre the formation : " I Right , " which will stack the backs in an I formation and move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , with time running out , Reid will remind Favre to " Watch the strong safety . He 's in a blitz position . " <p> " You do n't want to overcoach or overgab " on the radio , says Reid . " You just want to give the quarterback enough . " <p> Clyde Christensen , the coach who calls in plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , often uses any remaining radio time to relax Trent Dilfer , the team 's young quarterback . <p> " It gives you an opportunity to visit with him , " says Christensen . " You can settle him down a little . " <p> But , adds Gus Frerotte , the fourth-year quarterback for the Washington Redskins : " Once 15 seconds hits , you 're alone , on your own . " <p> Even a veteran quarterback like John Elway of the Denver Broncos appreciates his electronic tether to the sideline . <p> " It 's really helped , " says Elway . " It gives us a chance to do more things . The game is getting more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an example of technology in our society manifested in sports . " <p> But like all technology , the coach-to-quarterback radio is imperfect . When the quarterback takes a hit , the electronic equipment in his helmet gets rattled and sometimes shorts out . Coaches then must use hand signals or other means to get the next play in . <p> Researchers are working to prevent the quarterback 's radio  - -  and head  --  from banging around in the helmet . <p> Riddell , which outfits about 80% of the NFL with its $ 110 VSR4 helmet , has developed a plastic-rubber foam made out of vinyl nitrile to pad the blows . The company also has created a valve system that lets cushions of air flow into the helmet . <p> To test their hard hats , Riddell puts accelerometers , which measure the shock brains absorb on impact , in dummies ' heads . Then the dummies are dropped on computerized surfaces that gauge the severity of the collision . <p> No matter how serious their injuries , NFL players can benefit from high-tech healing . <p> When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan 's $ 100,000 hyperbaric chamber . The pressurized cubicle , which looks like a space capsule , soothes bruises by getting oxygen into the bloodstream . <p> If his players are hurting , Chicago Bears trainer Tim Bream often straps on Walkman-sized electric stimulators at the source of pain . With computer chips that regulate electrical waves , the $ 800 SporTX devices from Staodyn can be worn during games . <p> The Bears ' $ 7,000 Lymphopress , which helps reduce leg swelling , is n't portable . The plastic sheath from Tsiona Health Care pumps air pressure from toe to hip . <p> Screen play <p> Pumping up crowds at NFL stadiums should n't be a problem in coming years , thanks to large-screen video display technology known as LED , for light-emitting diode . <p> LED , which will offer fans a full spectrum of colors even in direct sunlight , will also use a type of Windows software . This means that 60- to 100-foot screens will show videos , ads , statistics and replays at the same time . <p> Large-screen video displays with LED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's models , which require $ 3 million-$ 5 million to own and operate . A large-screen LED video display system is expected to be installed in Tampa Bay 's new 65,000-seat stadium , opening next September . <p> One of the NFL 's older stadiums , Lambeau Field in Green Bay , has spawned a different technological breakthrough . To keep the turf from getting chewed up by 300-pound behemoths in cleats , the Packers have installed a revolutionary $ 1 million playing surface from Sport Grass that is part plastic and part natural . <p> The Packers also want to prevent their turf from turning into tundra , which is why they have put heat sensors below the playing surface . When Lambeau Field starts freezing , the sensors will alert computers that trigger subterranean warmth from gas-fired boilers . <p> Stadiums will soon have computers in their seats , too . <p> Vyvx has created a laptop-like PC system that enables fans to touch the screen and call up replays , statistics , highlights , interactive games and ads while sitting in the stands . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up at 515 seats and luxury boxes in late January , when the Super Bowl is played at San Diego 's Qualcomm Stadium . <p> The Vyvx system is exciting , but it may be too expensive . Industry experts estimate that each of the firm 's seats could cost an extra $ 2,000-$ 3,000 to install ; Vyvx president Del Bothof is trying to get that number down to $ 1,500 . <p> " The only issue , " says Bothof , " is whether the economics will be there . " <p> Satellite technology is already giving fans highlights of Sunday afternoon games around the NFL on giant video screens at 26 stadiums . <p> And 18-inch dishes are pulling in games on TV for those who ca n't get to the stadium . <p> Nearly 500,000 homes now subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket package on DirecTV and C-Band for $ 159 a season . <p> Sunday Ticket is popular because it lets people tailor their football-watching schedules . <p> Former secretary of State Henry Kissinger , a Sunday Ticket loyalist who likes the New York Giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says his subscription helps him zero-in on the most hotly contested NFL games and " avoid blowouts . " <p> Talk-radio host Don Imus , another Sunday Ticket fan , likes the New York Jets , Cowboys , Packers and Dolphins head coach Jimmy Johnson . <p> " I stick with winners , " says Imus . " If a team has a run of bad luck , it 's generally off my menu . " <p> High-tech , according to NFL interactive guru Ann Kirschner , may someday provide Imus , Kissinger and millions of others with a televised 3-D view of pro football games . <p> In the meantime , the NFL will keep rushing toward the digital future .
