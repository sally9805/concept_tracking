<p> For the first time since he left the White House in 1981 , the former president has earned respect at home . There 's even talk of a Nobel Peace Prize . <p> At 70 , Carter redefines role of elder statesman <p> Jimmy Carter was getting impatient . His wife , Rosalynn , had agreed to keep her comments brief . But in her excitement at describing Carter Center programs around the globe , she lost track of time . <p> He passed her a note . She paused to read it . <p> " Oh . I see I 've already talked for 10 minutes , " she said , smiling as the audience laughed during Tuesday 's town hall meeting at the Carter Center . <p> She kept talking . He shifted in his seat next to her on the podium and tried again to gently interrupt . <p> " Go ahead , dear , " he said , grinning . " We 'll just forget about Haiti . " <p> That is impossible . <p> Although he has his critics , Carter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion of Haiti . <p> It is the eve of his 70th birthday , and for the first time since he was booted out of the White House in 1981 , Jimmy Carter has earned broad respect at home . There 's even talk of a Nobel Peace Prize . <p> And Carter does n't seem ready to slow down . " I do n't think age makes that much difference , " said longtime friend Betty Pope of Americus . " He can still wear out three shifts of Secret Service agents . He 's extremely disciplined . " <p> Her husband , John , agreed : " He 's happy to still be with us . He does n't seem to age . " <p> In fact , he 'd rather not talk about his age at all . When he learned that People magazine wanted to interview him about his Oct. 1 birthday , he got upset . He prefers to talk to reporters about weightier topics , such as world peace , human rights and closing the gap between rich and poor . <p> Carter 's global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights have won him international acclaim in the years since he left Washington . But last week , after pulling the United States back from the brink of war , he got a hero 's welcome in his hometown , by crowds that have n't always embraced him . <p> Even the press is interested again . In the days immediately after his Haitian trip , the Carter Center press office was getting 200 requests a day for interviews . <p> At an Atlanta Chamber of Commerce luncheon , 500 business leaders gave Carter three standing ovations and applauded when speakers mentioned his Nobel nomination . The winner will be announced Oct. 14 , and the ceremony will take place in Oslo , Norway , on Dec. 10 . <p> He also was greeted with standing ovations at two town hall meetings - at the Carter Center and at Emory University , where 2,000 students and faculty members heard him recount the final , nail-biting hours of his cliffhanger diplomacy in Haiti . <p> " President Carter truly is deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize , " said Mayor Bill Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A long ' second term ' <p> His eleventh-hour diplomacy in Haiti is only the most recent act in what has become his " second term . " <p> Over the past 14 years , Carter has slowly and deliberately redefined the ex-presidency . It has led to jokes about how the White House was merely a steppingstone to a more stellar post-presidential career . <p> The Popes , former members of the " Peanut Brigade " - which campaigned for Carter when he was known as " Jimmy Who ? " - remember how dejected he was when he returned to Plains after a blistering loss to Ronald Reagan in 1980 . <p> " I told him when he lost , I said , ' Jimmy , God has something bigger and better for you to do , ' " Mrs. Pope said . " Evidently that was the truth . " <p> In the small club of former presidents , Carter shines . While others play golf and pen their memoirs , Carter keeps tightly scheduled 12-hour days , dividing his time between his Southern Oval Office at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his peace and humanitarian missions around the world . <p> He has carved himself a unique role as a diplomat without portfolio who answers only to himself . <p> This year , when he was n't monitoring elections or coaxing enemies to the peace table , Carter was building homes for the poor on an Indian reservation in South Dakota , telling Russian journalists in St. Petersburg how to fight government control , and climbing Mount Fuji in Japan . Now and then he indulged his passion for fishing . Carter 's post-presidential profile started rising in 1989 , when he monitored Panama 's elections and declared them fraudulent . In 1990 , he went to Nicaragua , where he persuaded Daniel Ortega to accept defeat by drawing on the painful memory of his own humiliating presidential loss . " I told him that I understood how he felt . " <p> ' Unsavory characters ' <p> But the stakes in Central America pale in comparison with what happened in Haiti and North Korea this year . Both times , he made peace by talking to leaders tagged as villains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what official diplomats could not . He defused international crises by , at times , embracing " unsavory characters . " <p> He also reversed the course of U.S. policy , and raised questions about whether his free-lance diplomacy is appropriate . <p> On Saturday , Secretary of State Warren Christopher traveled from Washington to Plains to iron out differences that have emerged over Carter 's mediation trips to North Korea and Haiti . The meeting , which lasted about three hours , was cordial , and both parties agreed to communicate better in the future . <p> Carter has said the State Department was " vehemently opposed " to his diplomatic missions , and he has criticized Washington for its refusal to deal directly with its enemies . <p> State Department spokesman Mike McCurry has said that reports of Christopher 's opposition to the Haiti mission were erroneous . <p> The key to Carter 's success is that he will talk to anyone , especially anyone at odds with Washington . " You have to communicate in some way " with your enemies , he said . <p> Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as U.S. troops were trying to hunt him down . Before the Persian Gulf War , Carter offered to mediate with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . He talked to Syrian President Hafez Assad and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat when Washington would n't , and last week , he disclosed that he 's talking to Fidel Castro of Cuba . <p> He described the Haiti talks - which almost collapsed when a Haitian general learned that U.S. paratroopers were on their way to Port-au- Prince - as " one of the most intense I have ever experienced . " <p> Carter , who had slept about four hours in two days , sensed that the deal was slipping away . In a rare outburst of raw emotion , he lost control . <p> " He just bared his soul , " said Mrs. Pope , who heard Mrs. Carter describe the scene . " She told us Jimmy broke down and cried . Tears were streaming down his face . " <p> To get the Haitians to sign , Carter delivered an emotional speech , urging the generals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embargo . He accused the generals of being selfish and said he was ashamed of his own country 's policy toward Haiti . <p> With 30 minutes to spare , the deal was signed . <p> He took a risk in June as well , when he went to North Korea to talk to President Kim Il-sung about the isolated Communist nation 's suspected nuclear weapons program . Despite a few missteps , some of which were broadcast live on CNN , Carter defused a brewing international crisis that might have led to war . <p> Kim died a few days later , but Carter is still talking to all sides in the dispute and has extracted a North Korean promise to abide by the late leader 's pledge . <p> Has worn many hats <p> James Earl Carter Jr . was born Oct. 1 , 1924 , in Plains , Ga. , the eldest of four children of James Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Gordy Carter . <p> An eighth-generation Georgian , Carter claims ancestors who were farmers , merchants and Civil War soldiers . <p> He earned an appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following World War II and served in the Navy 's nuclear submarine service in the early 1950s . <p> He was strongly influenced by Adm . Hyman G. Rickover , who once asked him about his grades at Annapolis . Carter replied that they were not always the best . " Why not the best ? " the admiral asked . This later became the title for Carter 's campaign autobiography . <p> He married Rosalynn Smith of Plains on July 7 , 1946 . They have four children : John William ( Jack ) , James Earl III ( Chip ) , Jeffrey and Amy Lynn . <p> When his father died in 1953 , Carter went home to Plains to manage the family interests , which included peanut-raising , warehousing and cotton-ginning businesses . <p> He started a business selling fertilizer and began working with the school board and hospital authority . He also was a deacon and Sunday school teacher at the Plains Baptist Church . When the church voted to exclude blacks , the Carter family opposed the move . <p> Election sensitivity <p> The man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1962 . His first race - for the state Senate - was nearly his last . <p> He lost because of blatant tampering with Quitman County votes . He successfully fought to overturn the results , and was re-elected to a second term in 1964 . <p> It was an experience he wrote about in his book " Turning Point , " and it influenced his post-presidential desire to referee elections in Third World countries . <p> He ran for governor in 1966 , but lost . He ran again and won in 1970 , becoming the 76th governor of Georgia . <p> He declared in his inaugural address , " I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over . " <p> As governor , he equalized education funds between rich and poor counties , took steps to improve the environment and helped improve the organization of state government . <p> Then he set his sights on a higher office . <p> Jimmy Who ? <p> On Dec. 12 , 1974 , he announced he would seek the Democratic nomination for president . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with family members and volunteers who formed the Peanut Brigade , " walked the streets , went into barbershops and beauty parlors and restaurants and stood in factory shift lines , farmers ' markets , livestock sale barns , county courthouses and city halls , just learning about our own country and letting them know us , " Carter recalled . <p> He stunned the nation when he won the New Hampshire primary Feb. 24 , 1976 . <p> " I 'm Jimmy Carter from Georgia and I 'm running for president , " he said in July 1976 as he opened his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York . <p> On Nov. 2 , 1976 , Carter won the closest presidential contest of this century , defeating Gerald Ford to become the 39th president of the United States , and the first one from Georgia . <p> The White House <p> Carter , president from 1977 to 1981 , was the first to be sworn in using his nickname . He was also the first president to walk from the Capitol to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaugural address , Carter spoke for human rights , environmental quality , nuclear arms control and " the search for justice and peace . " <p> In his memoirs , he wrote that his most lasting achievement as president was that he " printed the commitment of human rights on worldwide consciousness . " <p> He is best known for being the author of the Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel , and it was here that he honed his creative and stubborn negotiating tactics . <p> Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin later shared a Nobel Peace Prize for that achievement . Carter was the odd man out . <p> In other foreign affairs , he normalized relations with China and negotiated the Panama Canal treaties . <p> On the domestic front , he created the Education and Energy departments ; imposed a windfall tax on oil profits ; started Superfund to clean up chemical toxic waste dump sites and spills ; deregulated the airlines , the trucking industry and financial institutions ; and signed the Alaska Lands Conservation Act . <p> But his presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served only one term as president and was widely regarded as weak because of his inability to gain the release of American hostages held in the U.S. Embassy in Iran . <p> Former California Gov . Ronald Reagan was Carter 's Republican opponent in 1980 . Reagan won in a landslide with 489 electoral votes . Carter won six states - Georgia , Hawaii , Maryland , Minnesota , Rhode Island and West Virginia - and the District of Columbia , and received 47 electoral votes . <p> In January 1981 , Carter went without sleep his last two nights in the White House , trying to negotiate the hostages ' release before his presidency ended . After Reagan was sworn in , the 52 hostages were released , ending 444 days in captivity . Carter flew to Wiesbaden , Germany , to greet them as a private citizen . <p> Political comeback <p> After leaving the White House , a despondent Carter returned to Plains and turned his attention to raising $ 28 million for his presidential library . <p> He wanted it to be more than a monument and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict resolution center , open to warring parties from all over the world . <p> The Carter Presidential Library , built on a hilltop overlooking Atlanta , opened in 1986 . It holds 27 million documents from his years in office . <p> His think tank , the nonprofit Carter Center , is financed by corporations , foundations and individual donors . It is affiliated with Emory University and has 250 employees , more than 100 student interns and dozens more volunteers . It is home to a kaleidoscope of health and humanitarian programs , including the Carter-Menil Human Rights Foundation and Global 2000 , an initiative to end poverty , disease and suffering in Africa . <p> In addition to monitoring elections , Carter tried to mediate peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea . He also has tried to help end wars in Sudan and Liberia . <p> Two years ago , he turned his attention homeward and started The Atlanta Project in a bid to tackle poverty . <p> Since 1984 , he and Mrs. Carter have spent one week every year working for Habitat for Humanity , building houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation in Eagle Butte , S.D. <p> Carter said he hopes to raise a $ 100 million endowment that will keep the Carter Center going after he and Mrs. Carter retire to Plains . No one expects them to retire soon . <p> " He can work hard and long and travel , and it does n't seem to bother him much . He enjoys it , " said his longtime friend and adviser Charles Kirbo . " Everything he 's doing is trying to help somebody else . He 's gone all over the world and knows somebody everywhere in the world he can call on to help them . "
