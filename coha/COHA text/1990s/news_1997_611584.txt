<p> In varying ways , D.J . Tierney , Larry Kudlow and John Sheridan played crucial roles in the come-from-behind gubernatorial victory of Christine Todd Whitman four years ago . <p> Tierney , a member of the " soccer mom " constituency that voted for Whitman overwhelmingly , said she was attracted to Whitman because " I really felt it was time for there to be a woman who could address issues for women . " <p> Kudlow , a former Reagan administration budget official and Wall Street powerhouse , helped design the income tax cut proposal that Whitman used in the last weeks of her 1993 campaign to help push her from a 20-point deficit to a 26,093-vote victory over Gov . Jim Florio ( D ) . <p> Florio had raised taxes by $ 2.8 billion , just as New Jersey 's economy was collapsing in 1990 . The taxes were used in part to make court-ordered state payments to heavily minority inner-city schools , producing a tax revolt in moderate-income white suburban communities . <p> " That was a crucible election for all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really vital to the GOP comeback . " <p> Sheridan was a leader of the tax revolt , heading the organization Hands Across New Jersey . " In 1993 , we were a part of history , we helped send a message , " he said of Whitman 's victory . <p> Tierney , now divorced and financially pressed am extremely disappointed because I do n't think she really did effect any significant change for women , single women , working women and mothers in this state . " <p> Kudlow supports Whitman 's reelection , but said , " I just wish she had the same sense of leadership and risk-taking that she had in the first go-around . " <p> Sheridan may vote for Whitman but is considering voting for the Libertarian Party nominee . In 1993 , on a scale of 1 to 10 , Sheridan said , Whitman " was definitely a 10 , maybe an 11 . What a breath of fresh air she was . Now . . . I would say a 6 . " <p> Despite the loss of enthusiasm , Whitman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this state . She took office as the state 's economy turned around to become the strongest in the region . More than 196,000 new jobs have been created since her inauguration , crime is down and welfare rolls have been pared . <p> But over the past four years , some of the wind has gone out of Whitman 's sails . After fulfilling her campaign promise to cut income taxes by 30 percent , Whitman faces voter resentment over rising property taxes and the highest automobile insurance rates in the country . <p> Whitman 's Democratic opponent , Woodbridge Mayor and state Sen. James McGreevey , has seized on property taxes and auto insurance as the issues to win back the loyalty of the blue-collar " Reagan Democrats " Whitman attracted four years ago . <p> McGreevey accuses her of running " the biggest shell game in America , " charging that " the governor cuts state aid to school districts and municipalities , and local property taxes increase . For the first time in the state 's history , New Jersey now has the highest property tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to reduce state and local government pension obligations , the Whitman administration issued a $ 2.9 billion taxable bond to cover pension fund liabilities so that she did not have to pay them out of regular state tax revenue . <p> " The governor is basically playing the market , " McGreevey said . " Fiscal conservatives ought to be hanging black crepe around the statehouse . " <p> The Whitman campaign has already begun to counterattack , running television ads describing McGreevey as a tax-and-spend Democrat who voted , as a state legislator , for Florio 's $ 2.8 billion tax hike  --  a political disaster that resulted in the ouster of Democratic legislative majorities and Florio 's defeat in 1993 , the first general election repudiation of an incumbent since 1947 . <p> " We ca n't turn back the clock to Jim McGreevey 's high taxes . As Woodbridge mayor , McGreevey raised property taxes 43 percent . As a state legislator , McGreevey voted to raise sales and income taxes by $ 2.8 billion , " declared a Whitman ad . The Whitman campaign also intends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto insurance reforms as shifting financial burdens away from inner-city , heavily minority drivers onto the largely white , suburban majority that dominates this state . <p> Incumbency is a disproportionately powerful weapon in New Jersey . As governor , Whitman has had no problem raising the maximum amount of money permitted by law for her campaign . Moreover , she also can help fill the coffers of the state GOP , which is allowed to spend unlimited amounts on advertising that reflects Whitman 's positions . McGreevey faces the daunting task of raising enough money to make himself known to New Jersey voters , who are served by two of the most expensive media markets in the country , New York and Philadelphia . <p> Whitman , who has been running 3 to 12 percentage points ahead of McGreevey in the polls , contended in an interview that the very success of her administration has caused voters to turn to a new agenda of concerns  --  property taxes and auto insurance rates . <p> " Crime is at a 23-year low , unemployment is at the lowest it 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said we 'd reform the schools and we 've done it . We reformed welfare , our caseload is down 31 percent . And so people are now looking at the other things that have been there as factors , but were not at the top of their scale while they had to worry whether there was going to be a job for them the next day . " <p> Property taxes and auto insurance " are two critical issues we have not resolved fully , " Whitman said . " The people of this state are concerned about auto insurance , they have been . They are concerned about property taxes and have been . " <p> The governor 's case got a boost last weekend from the Newark Star-Ledger , which wrote : " Despite a widely held public perception that Whitman 's well-publicized income tax cuts fueled a trade-off increase in property taxes , state aid to municipalities has not gone down . On average , it has risen more than 15 percent since Whitman took office  --  compared with a 13.3 percent increase in property taxes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of places , the reason property taxes have gone up is simply because towns are spending more . " <p> The pension fund controversy appears likely to fade as a campaign issue . Henry Raimondo , an economist at Rutgers who has been a critic of the Whitman administration , said the " bond sold out quickly and the odds are it will turn out to make money for the state . . . . The bet she made looks like a decent bet . " <p> During her tenure , Whitman 's prospects for national office may have dimmed , many GOP strategists said . One of the ironies of Whitman 's governorship is that her appeal to socially liberal middle- and upper-middle-class voters through advocacy of abortion rights and gay rights  --  a constituency that was a target of President Clinton 's 1996 reelection strategy  --  has become a growing liability for her in Republican presidential politics . <p> " It was a bridge too far for a Republican candidate , even for the vice presidency , " GOP pollster Bill McInturff said , referring specifically to Whitman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth " abortions . <p> But for now , at least , Whitman avoids talking about any national ambitions , and instead focuses on winning reelection and keeping the broad coalition that elected her four years ago . <p> New Jersey 's newly elected Sen. Robert G. Torricelli ( D ) contends that Whitman faces an electorate that is moving steadily toward the Democratic Party , a trend reflected most strikingly in Clinton 's 17-point defeat of Robert J. Dole in 1996 . <p> " The unwritten story of national politics , " Torricelli argued , is that as the South moves to the GOP , " the northern suburbs are becoming increasingly Democratic , " especially in the face of a southern-dominated Republican congressional leadership " against abortion , against gun control , opposed to the environment . This is causing real Republican erosion among younger voters , women and the more affluent . " <p> Democrats as well as Republicans argue , however , that if Whitman runs into trouble in November , it most likely will result from defections among socially conservative working- and lower-middle-class white voters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said a New Jersey Whitman backer , noting that not only has Whitman been an adamant supporter of abortion rights , but that she endorsed affirmative action , and established a Gay and Lesbian Pride Month and a Coming Out Week . William Kristol , editor of the conservative Weekly Standard , who expects her to win , said : " New Jersey is a Reagan-Democrat state , and she has given the Reagan Democrats no reason to vote for her . " <p> The memory of the Florio years remains a powerful force in New Jersey , a force working to Whitman 's continued advantage . Francis Serge , a 32-year-old graphic artist loading groceries into his van in front of a Grand Union here , said , " After Jim Florio and unemployment and what it did to the economy of New Jersey , I would n't want to risk another Democrat again . . . . I think the Democrats have lost their scope , they 've swung so far to the left , I ca n't endorse that party anymore . "
