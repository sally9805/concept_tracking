Section : MY BRUSH WITH HISTORY BY THE READERS <p> In the fall of 1961 I was an English major at the University of Virginia and William Faulkner was writer-in-residence there . <p> Mr. Faulkner was at that time finishing The Reivers , his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel that would be published the following spring . I was doing some rudimentary research into Shakespeare 's Richard III for a paper that would never be published . <p> One day an announcement appeared on the English Department bulletin board stating that for the next six Thursday evenings Mr. William Faulkner would be pleased to hold a small symposium , open only to English majors and graduate students . The number of attendees would be strictly limited to the first twenty who signed on . <p> I had studied Faulkner the previous year under Joseph Blotner , one of the foremost Faulkner scholars , and had found Faulkner 's work incomprehensible . However , many considered him America 's greatest living writer , and the chance to learn from such a figure proved decisive . I signed on . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disciples and curious gathered in a room in Cabell Hall to hear the great man . Faulkner was a shy person with unremarkable speaking abilities , and it soon became apparent that this evening symposium had clearly not been his idea . <p> The sessions were scheduled to last an hour but Faulkner 's routine was to amble up to the lectern about ten minutes late , make a few desultory remarks , and then throw the floor open to questions . About the fourth session , when the speaker asked for questions , a dedicated young graduate student deep in a thesis on Faulkner , who always sat in the front row taking copious notes , raised his hand . " Mr. Faulkner , in paragraph ( such and such ) of section ( thus and so ) of your short story ' The Bear , ' you make reference to ( such and such ) . There has long been debate among scholars whether or not you were referring to the betrayal of Christ in that passage . Would you be so kind as to edify us on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man for a long moment . He then leaned on the lectern and a small smile appeared beneath his white mustache . " Young man , I regret I can not edify you . You see , I have n't read that story in more than twenty years , and besides , I was dead drunk when I wrote it . I have n't the slightest idea in hell what I had in mind when I wrote the passage to which you refer . " <p> Faulkner liked riding to hounds and would frequently join the hunt at the nearby Farmington Hunt Club or Keswick Hunt Club . Now it happened that I had friends who rode with both those packs , and I , too , enjoyed a good hunt on a fine fall day . <p> Not too long after the incident in his symposium , I encountered the novelist one chilly November morning at the punch bowl in the Farmington Hunt Club lodge prior to the call to horses . " Good morning , Mr. Faulkner , " I said . He nodded and then appraised me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are n't you in that goddamned Thursday symposium of mine ? " he asked . When I replied in the affirmative , he said , " I thought you looked familiar . You 're one of the few who never say anything . I wish there were more like that . Tell me , why did you sign up for the damned thing anyway ? Are you one of those people who 're majoring in me ? " <p> I laughed and , to gain a little time , offered him a Lucky Strike and then lit one myself . He declined , indicating his pipe . " No , sir , I 'm not majoring in you . In fact , I do n't even understand most of what you write . I just thought it would be foolish not to take advantage of the opportunity . " <p> " I like that , son . No bullshit . What 's your name ? I 'm terrible with names . " <p> I told him , and we had another cup before the call to mount . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding with today ? " I told him no one in particular , and he suggested we ride together . We went to our mounts , mine a kind chestnut mare that belonged to a friend and his a big brown gelding he had borrowed . Faulkner was a small man , not more than five foot six and not the most steady horseman . He needed assistance in mounting , and the big gelding nearly unseated him straight-away . <p> We were soon on our way in pursuit of the hounds and Faulkner made the first two or three jumps , but then his horse balked at a " chicken-coop " jump and its rider went flying . I was just behind and stopped to help . It was apparent that Mr. Faulkner was n't hurt , but neither was he too keen to continue . After sending the others onward , he turned to me : " Dick , my boy , what say you we go back to the lodge and have us a punch . That 's the only really civilized aspect of this damned sport anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had a most pleasant morning drinking brandy milk punch and discussing the old South , women , and maybe a little literature . We met one or two more times fox hunting , and I went to the last two of his " goddamned symposiums . " <p> The following spring , when The Reivers came out , he appeared at a local bookstore signing first editions . I bought one and got in line . When it came my turn , he spoke to me cordially and even remembered my first name . He wrote in the book , " To Dick-Remember , the best part of the hunt is the punch . " He signed it " William ( Bill ) Faulkner . " In less than two months Mr. Faulkner was dead . I treasured that book ( although I never read it ) until it was destroyed in a fire in my apartment some years later . But maybe it does n't matter , because the memory is just as keen as ever . <p> Readers are invited to submit their personal " brushes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid on acceptance . Unfortunately , we can not correspond about or return submissions . <p> PHOTO : Willima Faulkner , at left , ready for the hunt . ( UPI/BETTMANN ) <p> By Richard C. Latham <p> <p> Richard C.
