<p> Botanic Gardens should consider the satellite solution <p> The central issue surrounding the conflict with Denver Botanic Gardens ' ambitious building plans is whether the desirable goal of promoting botanical interests to a larger audience can be done on this petite site . <p> Every metro area citizen should be concerned about this plan promoted by well-meaning volunteers , some with international reputations in gardening but who show little knowledge of urban planning issues or concern for meaningful public input . <p> The City of Denver is in partnership with the private , tax-exempt foundation known as Denver Botanic Gardens Inc . The city furnishes the land and some operating funds from taxes . The foundation , through a volunteer board and paid employees , manages the gardens and raises money to build facilities and contribute operating funds . All land , buildings and plants are the permanent property of the City of Denver . The five-county Scientific and Cultural Facilities District provides tax funds to further many area scientific and cultural institutions . Together with Denver 's own tax support , public taxes now support about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare for this SCFD funding , the foundation promoted a new contract with the city , executed in 1991 . <p> At first glance , the contract seems fairly innocuous and deals with almost exclusively botanical mandates . However , there is a small loophole . The foundation insists it has a right to conduct events and activities far removed from its scientific , botanical mission . There is now an increasing use as well as expressed intent for the gardens to serve as a back-drop for events which have little or no botanical focus . <p> Also , the contract gives the foundation a disturbing autonomy . The executive director is an employee of the foundation , not a city employee as formerly . During the course of the Master Plan inception , Bruce Alexander was acting director of the gardens . He later became director of parks and recreation . As such , he signed the approval for the Gardens Master Plan without public process through the city 's Planning and Community Development Department . This was a conflict of interest . <p> Had the master plan been required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns would have been voiced by citizens and considered by the Planning Board : <p> ( 1 ) Wo n't a future half-million visitors to the gardens impact adjoining Congress and Cheesman Parks - already straining under the gardens ' present loading at events ? <p> ( 2 ) Four almost pristine historic districts and other established residential neighborhoods lie near the gardens . Would n't non-botanical events impact these homes and nearby streets - already congested by unforeseen entertainment events ? <p> ( 3 ) In the last analysis , the gardens are there for botanical appreciation by tax payers . Is commercialization through renting public property for weddings , receptions and other private functions ( in competition with private enterprise ) really an equitable use for increasingly crowded public gardens ? <p> The foundation is determined to build without first solving its parking problems . Even the proposed " Children 's Garden " building , an otherwise laudable project , will cause troubles with numerous bus visitations in an area unsuited to them . It is entirely probable that previously recommended studies on future plans for a large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no adequate solution in an inherently difficult site with many traffic problems . <p> The best solution if the foundation insists on spending $ 40 million , plus $ 10 million for a parking structure , is to plan for satellite development . <p> Take the same money over time and eventually add other sites in the five counties that support this institution as major players . The Chatfield Arboretum shows this can work . <p> The Denver Botanic Gardens Foundation should ask the Gates Foundation , which has so far committed funding for the ill-conceived Meeting House , for permission to use those funds toward this larger public purpose . <p> Other contributing foundations should follow this lead to encourage Denver Botanical Gardens Inc . Foundation to consider the satellite solution . <p> G.M. CANON <p> Former trustee , Denver Botanic Gardens , <p> member , Citizens for Botanic Gardens <p> Steering Committee , Denver <p> Ethics gap 's the real problem in ' bitch ' flap <p> Tricked by Connie Chung into believing that she was speaking off the record during a CBS interview , Newt Gingrich 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " bitch . " <p> Predictably , the White House and liberals across the country yowled about how disrespectful the new House speaker was ; some of them probably even called him names ! <p> The real outrage should have been aimed at an unethical television " journalist " who , with the full support of her boss , used some spicy hearsay , obtained in a sleazy manner , to boost her show 's viewership . <p> It would be absurd , given her education and professional background , to expect the First Lady to be just another decorative White House hostess . But it 's also naive and hypocritical of Mrs. Clinton to assume that , since she is willingly and personally involved in the formulation of some of the policies of her husband 's administration ( i.e. : she 's a politician ) , she will not make enemies and be called names . <p> What , one wonders , does Hillary call Newt Gingrich in private ? " That slimy Newt ! " ? Or maybe , when she 's really angry , " That darn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new speaker can be churlish at times and he probably will put his foot in his mouth on future occasions , he is still entitled to have his private thoughts and conversations kept that way unless he chooses to make them public . <p> The only disrespectful players in this piece are Ms. Connie Chung and her boss , CBS News President Eric Ober . <p> MARK PROPER <p> Arvada <p> Why not tame all of the wilderness ? <p> Anthony Twinwolf , in the Wednesday ( Jan. 4 ) Post , wrote that destroying the Quartzite Falls on the Salt River in Arizona was justified , stating that the raft trip through the Salt River Canyon was for experts only and dynamiting the falls would save many lives . This argument has softened my outrage over this incident . <p> I see now that if the logic is applied widely , many new recreational opportunities will become available to less-than-expert recreationists . <p> For example , it has always been my ambition to climb Longs Peak . <p> But because I 'm not a technical climber , I figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to take the long , but easy trek up the north flank of the mountain , because the perilous East Face was for experts only and many climbers have died while attempting to climb that route . <p> But now , by applying Twinwolf 's argument , this much more exciting climb can be made accessible to us less-gifted outdoorsmen . All the Park Service has to do is install ladders on the East Face . <p> I 'm sure that this would not detract from the " ultimate experience " of getting to the top of the mountain . <p> By applying the precedent set by the altruistic and compassionate act of the Quartzite Falls bombers , Longs Peak and all of the other dangerous outdoor recreation spots in National Parks and Wilderness Areas can be made safe and accessible to everyone . <p> Or , perhaps there should be some spots left in the world which are left dangerous , and which not everyone will be able to experience . <p> STEPHEN CORN <p> Fort Collins <p> ' Street Smarts ' slur <p> was nasty and ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sic ) in The Denver Post Business section decides to get the New Year off to a rousing start on Jan. 1 with an attack against emigrants to Colorado from California . He/she takes exception to " the way they hog our highways , clog our ski runs and drive our real estate prices sky-high . " The last time I looked , there were far more Coloradans clogging our roads and ski hills than Californians . And is it really the opinion of The Post Business section that we were better off when local real estate values were falling ? <p> This commentary strikes me as particularly nasty in tone , ignorant in content and really not far off the virulence some of the nice folks in Evergreen inflicted on their neighbors last year . The fact that this attack appears in The Post and is addressed to a whole group of people is hardly a defense . <p> P.E . KAVANAGH <p> Denver <p> Why the arbitrary date <p> in emissions test program ? <p> New emissions testing regulations state that " 1995 automobiles purchased after Oct. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A call to the service manager of Duncan Buick states that , " We have received no service bulletins of changes in the 1995 Buick 's emission system : A series of calls made to the Colorado Department of Revenue , Colorado Department of Health and to the Colorado Emissions Testing Office itself could produce no reason why this Oct. 1 date was set rather than , " All 1995 cares sold new would be exempt from emissions testing for four years . " As a result , my 1995 Buick , bought in September , must be driven down from Evergreen and I must wait in line because someone set an arbitrary date . <p> DON SOUTHARD <p> Evergreen
