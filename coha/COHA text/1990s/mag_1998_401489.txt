As Maria Neeman* , a 28-year-old single makeup ( and make-out ) artist in Los Angeles likes to point out , most men would rather gnaw off their own left foot than ask for directions , whether it 's to a hot vacation spot or an even hotter G-spot . Accordingto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field-playing is self-admittedly prolific ) , if you uncover a guy who shows signs of being good at following your guidance-he got in sync with your move-more-to-the-left hip swivels , let you put his hands where you needed them , or even straight-out asked what you wanted-then you have some prime manly material to work with . " If he 's paying attention , " says Susan Block , Ph.D. , a sex therapist in Los Angeles and author of The Ten Command-ments of Pleasure ( St. Martin 's Press , 1996 ) , " and not blindly bulldozing you with some macho **44;373;TOOLONG sexual repertoire , he 'll put effort into learning your libidinous likes and dislikes . " How to tap into his talent Easy-more direction . " Since he 's responsive , all this guy needs is a little more one-onone tutelage , " says Block . Of course , we 're not advocating grabbing a megaphone and red-flagging him in . Try a slightly more subtle approach , like giving him positive reinforcement when he does the right thing . Say ' Ohh , that feeLs good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . ' Be as specific as you can without seeming judgmental or condescending . Or try Maria 's trick : " I find it easier to let someone know what I do n't like , " she says . " Before we hit the hayride , I 'll very casually inform the guy I 'm with that I do n't like making love with the lights off or that I 'm not turned on unless there 's a lot of kissing going on . He ca n't help but make a mental note . " Photograph // He 's history : If he was so adept at taking direction that you felt more like a sideline coach than one of the players , then it 's bad bedroom news . " If he needed instructions for every single minor move he made , he 's either less creative than Al Gore or too fearful of doing something wrong to risk trying a maneuver of his own , " warns Block . " I told one first-time guy I liked my breasts touched , " recalls Maria . " So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half . He just kept doing this persistent nipple tweaking thing as if my breast was a stalled Buick and he was determined to start its engine . I finally realized he was waiting for me to tell him what to do next . After a night of preachy and frankly kind of painful passion , I decided that his lack of initiative ruined his chance for a second sex round . " On the other hand , if he employed your between-the-sheets session to pay his personal tribute to Frank Sinatra by doing it his way , he 's not as interested in finding out what you want as he is determined to show you what he thinks you need . SECOND CHANCE-WORTHY CLUE 2 He has good hands .

Sadie Bell , a 27year-old actress , successfully employed this massage method to hurdle over the goodhands-bad-handiwork hump of her new bedfellow Phil . " I gave him a rubdown first and touched him the way I wanted to be touched . Then when it was his turn to give , he mimicked my massage , and I let him know via loud oohs and ahhs where I most fancied his fingerwork . Going mano a mano gave me the benefit of his best feature ( his hands ) , pls he applied the lessons he learned to the rest of our sex life . " He 's history : He could have had crackerjack manual dexterity , but if he just could n't seem to make the right moves despite your best educational efforts , chances are those mitts wo n't do much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a shiver-inducing touch , " says Sadie . " But instead of working with it , he took the compliment as license to slack off in every other area . He thought simply laying his hands on me was enough to rock my world . He was wrong . " SECOND-CHANCE-WORTHY CLUE 3 He 's gme for a good time . When Beth Grant , 27 , a food critic in Boston , had sex with Reuben for the first time , he was so into it yet awkward that at one point , he actually slid on their combined sweat and nearly rolled off the bed . When they were finished , she turned to him and asked not how fast he thought he could gather his pants and parade himself out of her life , but when they could see each other again . Why ? Because although lie seemed all nervous , he was still fun and he was n't squeamish about being exploratory in bed . I knew he 'd eventually relax and would n't be afraid to develop our sexual rapport .

The good news is his unwavering enthusiasm and his ironclad constitution mean he 's probably literally up for anything . So appeal to his practice-makesperfect attitude . " Go through a few more rounds and build some trust , then simply start guiding him in all the ways you want , " says Beth . " You 'll eventually come up with what works for both of you , and over time , he 'll hone his sexual skills . This kind of guy is n't creeped out by a little adventure , or moisture , so he 's not going to be weirded out by a little direction in bed . " He 's history : If his bedside manner was so completely unbridled that he delved into places that , as a rule , should require a GYN degree to explore and expected you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of guy who is responsive to what you need . " This guy is more interested in the erotic escapade than connecting with you on mutual terms , " says Lloyd . " He 's not the type to pause and double-check that you 're both on the same passionate page . And since this is not a skill that can be learned-it 's a mind-set-it 's time to send his mind and body off to someplace else . " SECOND-CHANCE-WORTHY CLUE 4 He 's tuned in to your emotional state . " If the sex stint was too stiff , but your guy was attentive to your emotional needslike cuddling , looking deep into your eyes , pillow-talking till dawn-then he has half the erotic equation mastered , " says Lloyd . He may just suffer from a case of stage fright and feel more confident showing off his tender affection than his physical prowess . This is a guy who has buried sex talent worth excavating , even if physically he could body double for the Tin Man . How to tap his talent " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional stuff ( like the fact that it 's your first time together ) is going to affect him and throw off his technical ability , " says Block . " Reassure him . Let him know you like spending time and becoming close to him . Maybe spend a day together without any sexual pressure . Chances are , the more mellow he feels , the less mechanical he 'll be . " He 's history : If he was so sensitive that you felt the urge to share horrifying waxing stories , it may be time to call it quits . " I slept with a guy who was really compassionate , " says Alice Nidde , 25 , a photographer in New York City " During dinner , I thought it was just wonderful that I did n't have to contend with any macho malarkey , but when he actually teared up after sex , I realized his soft side was n't enough to make up for his lack of lust-fueling fire . " SECONDCHANCE-WORTHY CLUE 5 He has a sense of humor . " The first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexually fatal airborne-diaphragm incident ( which would require lengthy explationand accompanying visuals to relay the full effect ) actually turned out to be Ivan 's sexual savior , " says Claudia , a 29-year-old dressmaker in Austin , texas . " The sex was n't going too well at first and I was pretty much ready to write him off But when he made a joke about what could have been a really humiliating event , Ivan was immediately redeemed . He defused the tension with his lighthearted attitude and made our bedroom blunder no big deal . He may not have shown award-winning physical ability , but his easygoing approach more than made up for it . " How to tap into his talent : " Laughter is an aphrodisiac , " says Block . " It 's like a mental orgasm . So as long as you 're having fim and sticking to the laissez-faire school of sex , becoming acquainted between the sheets will be exciting . In fact , laughing at your own flub-ups will tip him off that you 're not such a scary and strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more relaxed he is , the more his performance will improve . " And you can also remind him that slipping between the sheets is n't going to save the whales or repair the ozone layer-it 's purely for pleasure . Making it fun is really the point . He 's history : If he could n't seem to turn off the laughs and made a joke out of everything ( e.g. , an obvious romantic moment , an escaped condom ) , he may have a problem being sincere about his real emotions . " In this case , it 'll be hard to connect with him on any level , not just sexually , " says Block . There 's a happy medium between Don Juan and Don Rickles , and if this guy requires a laugh track in the sack , chances are , he 's not going to take your concerns seriously and be open to improving his sexual moves .
