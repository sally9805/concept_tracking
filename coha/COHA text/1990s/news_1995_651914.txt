<p> Following are excerpts from winning essays in Barnard College 's annual writing competition for 11th grade girls in New York City 's public high schools . The theme is " A Woman I Admire . " First prize was awarded to Amelia H. Chamberlain of Townsend Harris High School in Queens . Mama 's Dark World <p> It 's 10 o'clock , time to wake up Mama . Frustration washes over me because I 'm sitting on my bed , covered with books . One by one , I push them aside . <p> I open my bedroom door into a wall of darkness . I look back into my lighted room with regret and creep into the living room . All the lights are off and the shades are drawn . <p> On the couch lies Mama . Her hair is standing on all ends and her face is a perfect mask of peace . I give her shoulder a shake , telling her that it 's 10 o'clock . Instantly , her eyes pop open and she starts to get up . <p> I turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks me to make her a cup of coffee . I swivel around , and a spark of anger flicks through my eyes . The guilt quickly replaces it . How can I be angry ? Every day she gets up and goes to work on four or five , sometimes only two hours of sleep . She even works overtime every chance she gets . I tell her not to push herself , but she says we need the money . And all she 's asking me for is a cup of coffee . <p> So I go to the kitchen . I leave the lights off , as if light would be an intrusion on Mama 's dark world . I pour a cup of coffee and add milk and sugar just the way Mama likes it . I take it back to her . She 's already dressed and sitting up on the couch . <p> I hand her the cup of coffee and she thanks me . I tell her Dad called and said he was n't coming to do the work on the porch on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . <p> All too quickly , she has to leave . She hands me my $3.60 for school and kisses me on the cheek . As always , she tells me she loves me . Then she walks out the door and drives off to her job . <p> I watch from the door in wonder . How does she do it ? How does she always remember to give me $3.60 for school ? How does she always remember to tell me that she loves me ? How does she work all night and do errands all day ? How does she raise me and my sisters on her own ? She never gives up or says , " I ca n't go today . " She never , ever , does n't get up , no matter how little sleep she 's gotten . <p> I shut and lock the door . I walk silently through Mama 's dark world and go back to my bright room . I replace the books on my lap . Before I begin again , I turn my eyes toward God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAMBERLAIN , Townsend Harris High School , Queens An Open Mind <p> She sits by the window , rocking back and forth in the early morning light . I look at her hands . They are old , rough and wrinkled , not like my hands , which are young and smooth , yet hers are stronger . There 's a story behind the left index finger , the one with half a nail . That 's where a parrot bit her , on the outskirts of a small Central American village . <p> I look at her arms , round and firm . They are strong from those nights she would swim with her sisters , proud and graceful as dolphins , in the lake by their country house . <p> I look now at her face , so much like my own , like my mother 's . I 'm not fooled by the crow 's feet and deep creases on her forehead , because her eyes are young , alive with a shining vitality . <p> Who is she ? I call her Abuela . She is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch fish with her bare hands , pan for gold , cook a souffle . She can dance a waltz and climb a cliff . <p> Born of wealthy Spanish-Arabic parents in Honduras , she traveled far and wide in her childhood , picking up several languages . As an adult , she lived in different countries like India , Norway , France and even Australia . In each of these places she did not bring preconceived notions of what her particular culture considered " normal . " In fact , she never did , and still does n't , judge people based on their appearance or cultural background , but waits until she knows their personality . <p> I hope , one day , I 'm as strong and wise as my grandmother .  --  NICOLE A. PLUMAIL , Stuyvesant High School , Manhattan The Laundry Room <p> There 's a room in the back of my house ; we call it the laundry room . It 's small and painted 1950 's green ; the floor is tiled what used to be black and white and is now gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a boarded-up hole in the window . There 's a layer of dust about two inches deep on the soap shelf that one 's finger can never quite penetrate . And the jagged lines in the decaying walls form intricate designs that a 6-year-old 's mind can turn into a masterpiece . The laundry room has always reminded me of Grandma . <p> When I was about 6 years old , I thought Grandma was the meanest woman alive . She drank bourbon at 4 o'clock in the afternoon ; it was her version of tea time . Grandma yelled when she lost at hearts and was nothing short of boisterous when she won . <p> I never knew much about Grandma when she was alive ; she had built a wall around herself and I could never find an opening . I saw her only about once or twice a year because she lived out in California . If anything , I was her least favorite grandchild . <p> But one of my favorite memories of Grandma was when she took my sister and me to see " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the best seats in the house  --  the last row , where we could eat Crunch bars and take off our shoes . I felt like a princess in my black velvet dress with the big red bow . <p> After the show , we waited on the platform for the No. 2 train to Brooklyn to arrive , and I got lost in the crowd and was left on the platform . I remember yelling hysterically for my grandmother and seeing her pink hat bobbing up and down as she silently screamed at me behind the glass doors . I remember the quick , cold silver of the train as it rushed past me in a quiet blur . When we were reunited , I was so happy at being found and realizing Grandma was so upset she was crying . That was the first time I felt loved by this woman I called Grandma . <p> Now as I stand in the laundry room , five years after her death , staring at the cracked walls , I remember her wrinkled face and snow-white hair . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite penetrate , just like Grandma . And the dryer hose pumping steam out into the crisp midnight air , reminding me of Grandma 's temper and stubbornness , which has been carried on to me . And as I look around the laundry room , I am reminded of the woman who has vanished into these cracks , the woman who is slowly emerging from these same green walls .  --  MARGARET HUFFMAN , Midwood High School , Brooklyn On the Run <p> It was 1982 and a thin , young woman was moving nervously along the Bronx streets holding her daughter 's hand tightly . She was searching for the nearest hotel , trying not to think about what her husband was going to do when he discovered that she had n't returned home . <p> The woman was 22 years old , with medium- length brown hair . There was an ugly bruise on her cheek . At 5 feet 7 inches , she felt as conspicuous as a totem pole . Her name was Nereida Rosado and she had just left her husband . <p> As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how she was going to survive on the little money she had . She entered under a garish neon sign and walked to the front desk . " How much does it cost to stay here for a night ? " my mother asked . The man said , " Fifteen dollars . " " Good , then I 'll stay here for "  --  she counted again  --  " two nights . " <p> Nereida knew that she could n't stay longer because she would run out of money ; worse , she felt instinctively that somehow her husband was going to find her if she stayed in one place . We went to our small , overheated hotel room and Mommy plopped herself on the well-used bed . Tired of walking and worrying , my mother lay down and went to sleep , and I was glad to nestle close to her . I do n't think we even took our shoes off . <p> For a year her husband continued following her every move . Moments when we forgot my father and breathed easy were rare treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when suddenly he was banging on the door very hard and shouting . We panicked and ran to the fire escape . Our neighbor opened the window and let us in . My mother told her friend to call the cops and tell them that her husband tried to break in . By the time the police came , my father had left . The next week my mother hired a lawyer and won a restraining order . I later found out that our neighbors and my aunt all contributed to paying the lawyer 's fee . <p> Soon after my eighth birthday Nereida placed her hands on my shoulders and said : " This is our fourth year on welfare . If we do n't do something we 'll spend the rest of our lives this way . I need you to be a big girl for your aunt during the evenings so I can go to school . " <p> The next year a moment of great excitement arrived one Saturday morning in the mail . She scored 50 points above the passing score of the high school equivalency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our apartment , jumping up and down . A friend got her a job as a bookkeeper . <p> Over the years , Nereida Rosado took to wearing business suits and matching shoes with high heels . When I first noticed , I said , " Mommy , you look so tall  --  and so good . " She turned from checking herself in the mirror to look me straight in the eyes and said , " What makes me tall is being your Mommy . "  --  IVELLISSE RODRIGUEZ , Harry Van Arsdale High School , Brooklyn The Storyteller <p> I would rather forget my elementary school years . They were full of unpleasant people and black days . I can still name most of the kids who were in my class at P.S. 103 in the Bronx . They were all part of the loneliness I felt , the loneliness that came with unacceptance and ridicule . <p> I was one of the few Indian kids in a school of mostly African-Americans and Hispanics . I tried my hardest to fit in with my " friends , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading Bop magazine , talking about how cute Kirk Cameron and Ralph Macchio were , listening to Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam and practicing the latest dance moves . For a while , I even developed a Puerto Rican accent . <p> Maybe it was my parents ' fault for not supplying me with the latest pair of Nikes every month and not letting me style my hair the way the other girls did . They came from a country where getting anything besides three meals a day was considered a blessing . <p> The gray clouds that hung around me were blown away whenever I entered the school library . It was here that I found encouragement from a very special woman , Mrs. Miller , the school librarian . She was small-framed , always wore makeup , and had thick , luxuriant brown hair , cut close to her head . Her smile was her signature . From ear to ear , it was a smile that embodied her whole personality , her values and her dedication to her job and to us . <p> I had the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the librarian 's task to train me for the competition . We often had lunch together in the library , me with my peanut butter and jelly sandwich and she with her ham on rye and yogurt . We did n't talk much because she was usually doing her paperwork . But it did n't matter . It was the plain fact that I was in her company that thrilled me . Her eyes always promised trust , and her voice , rich and resonant , had a sad tone about it that was soothing , like a mother 's singing of her baby to sleep . <p> I never told her any of my problems , about how humiliated I was when some of the boys would clap their hands , whoop , hop about on one leg and ask me to do the rain dance . I did n't need to tell her ; she read it in my eyes . I practiced my story over and over , making sure I did it to her satisfaction . When I won , she hugged me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced . <p> After I graduated , I never looked back at the school . Mrs. Miller told me to visit but I never did . It would have meant walking through the same halls that held so many poignant memories . As the years passed , I heard she left the school and I heard later that she went back to college . She probably thinks I have forgotten all about her . But I will always carry her , my pillar of hope , with me wherever I go .  --  DEEPTI THOMAS , Bronx High School of Science
