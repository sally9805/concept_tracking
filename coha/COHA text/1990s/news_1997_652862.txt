<p> IT WAS SO OFTEN REPEATED that it became pop music legend : Laura Nyro , early in her precocious career , bombed at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival , booed off the stage by a stoned audience that could n't follow her meandering lyricism . <p> But it was n't true , this supposed fact that appeared in nearly every obituary of the singer and songwriter who died last spring at 49 of ovarian cancer . <p> Footage of the landmark concert by the filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker shows instead a mesmerizing performance by Nyro , who casts the occasional darting glare at a lousy backup band . And when she finishes , a half-smile belying her disappointment , the crowd applauds heartily , and one man even cries : " Beautiful ! " There is nary a boo . <p> " She just imagined the whole thing , " Mr. Pennebaker said . <p> Nyro 's oversensitive misreading of this performance , which she perpetuated and no one challenged , helps explain the central enigma of her career : why she ran away from stardom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best 1960 's musicians , Nyro vanished at her professional apex and , while eventually re-emerging , never claimed the overarching fame that was nearly hers . She never had a hit single or a gold record , although her songs  --  " And When I Die , " " Stoned Soul Picnic " and " Wedding Bell Blues , " among others  --  earned them for other artists . <p> Immediately after her death , in April , Nyro 's family and close friends declined to talk about her publicly , zealously guarding her lifelong desire for utmost privacy . Now , though , on the eve of a Nyro tribute concert tomorrow night at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan , they have been more forthcoming , offering a quite simple , if seemingly cliched , explanation for her retreat from the limelight : Nyro opted out of the music business because its crassness and commercialism increasingly and unbearably offended her artistic soul . <p> Perched on a stool in his modest apartment in Manhattan , Nyro 's proud father , Louis Nigro , an 81-year-old piano tuner , sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold records on her walls as Neil Sedaka , " he said . " But Laura was always very sensitive . She did n't like collaboration . She did n't like compromise . She was an artist , and she did n't like  --  hated  --  the show-biz part . " <p> Nyro 's fans worshiped her purism , and tomorrow night 's tribute will be almost a cult happening . Patti LaBelle , one of Nyro 's closest musician friends , will headline an evening also featuring Phoebe Snow , Sandra Bernhard , Cyndi Lauper and a homemade video of Nyro on Nyro , filmed in her final year . <p> " She was a soulful , fat mama , and I loved her , " Ms. LaBelle said . <p> In her last 25 years , according to music-industry lore , Laura Nyro was a recluse who had metamorphosed from a sultry teen-ager into a plump earth mother who issued sporadic , fringe albums dotted with songs about animal , maternal and American Indian rights . ( One song , " The Descent of Luna Rose , " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was reclusive only in the industry 's view ; she did n't play arenas or go on major tours or make music videos . Instead , flush with the money of her early success , she cobbled a quieter life for herself , in which she wrote what she wanted when she wanted , put out an album when it felt ready and performed in places where she felt accommodated , like the Bottom Line in New York . <p> The heart of Nyro 's existence was domestic but not hermetic . She lived for 17 years with Maria Desiderio , a 43-year-old painter , who has equally thick , flowing dark hair . On a bucolic property in Danbury , Conn. , complete with babbling brook and duck-filled pond , they raised Nyro 's son , Gil Bianchini , who is now 19 . Their house was spare and uncluttered , decorated with Isamu Noguchi paper lamps , a grand piano and hundreds of books ( mostly by women ) . They cooked and hiked and traveled the country in a camper . Nyro had never liked signing autographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seldom recognized . <p> " The business of music was something that was never comfortable for Laura , " Ms. Desiderio , a Brooklyn native , said . " She saw a lot of fake friendships and false emotions . But the business of life  --  Laura lived very fully . She was nothing like a hermit . " <p> A close friend , Zoe Nicholson , portrayed the relationship between Ms. Desiderio and Nyro as a profound personal and artistic bond , " like Stein and Toklas , or Dali and his wife , or Kahlo and Diego Rivera . " <p> She also described a 1970's-vintage feminist spirituality that dwelled in their home . " Do n't be worried about overemphasizing that Laura lived a woman-identified , goddess-driven existence , " Ms. Nicholson said . " Everything was about female energy with the exception of her son . " <p> Asked to elaborate , Ms. Nicholson said , " Mother earth , mother nature , looking to the moon . " <p> NYRO STARTED OUT AS A child of the macadam .

She spent summers at the Catskill hotels where her father , then a trumpeter , had gigs with the big bands . Her mother , Gilda , a bookkeeper with the American Psychoanalytic Association , gave her a highbrow cultural education at the city 's museums and concert halls . <p> Nyro 's sensitivity began young ; she quit piano lessons at 8 because the stern teacher made her cry and Nyro subsequently had little formal training until she attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan . But she began writing songs at 8 , too , pounding away at the family 's Steinway grand piano . <p> By age 12 , she practically slept with a keyboard . At 14 , as a junior camp counselor , she turned color-war songs into five-part harmonies . At 16 , she sang doo-wop in subway stations and shut herself in her bedroom to listen to Mary Wells and to the Ronettes . And at 17 , she sold her first song , " And When I Die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul and Mary . <p> A first album , " More Than a New Discovery " ( 1966 ) , quickly followed , introducing the pattern of her career : songs that she did not want to tailor for release as singles were scooped up by other performers  --  the Fifth Dimension , Barbra Streisand , Blood , Sweat and Tears  --  who made them hits . <p> " She never wanted to change a single note or a single word in her songs , " her father said . " Early on , one arranger told her that something she wrote was impossible musically , and she cried . " <p> With a three-octave range of emotions and a confessional style , Nyro turned her insides out in music that defied easy categorization because it was so many things at once : bubbly and soul-searching ; commercial and experimental ; jazzy and bluesy , with a touch of soul and doo-wop . <p> In 1968 , David Geffen , then an aspiring agent , spotted all this in a tape of Nyro 's supposedly disastrous performance at Monterey and signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Beverly Hills hotel room before Clive Davis , then president of Columbia Records , Nyro felt so shy that she asked for the lights to be turned off and performed to the glow of a soundless television . <p> She got a $4 million contract ; she and Geffen mutually kick-started each other 's careers . With her next albums , " Eli and the Thirteenth Confession " and " New York Tendaberry , " she made her mark on a generation of future songwriters , from Ricki Lee Jones and Suzanne Vega to Barry Manilow and Todd Rundgren . <p> By then , she was living in a penthouse apartment near Central Park , barely an adult and awkwardly throwing work her father 's way , recommending him as a piano tuner to music-industry friends like Mr. Sedaka and Bette Midler . <p> Within a few years , her bond with Mr. Geffen had frayed , and when he formed Asylum Records , she stayed with Columbia . Ms. Desiderio said the relationship fell apart the same way others had and would . " She had a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was not , " she said . " She was not a musician for hire . " <p> At 24 , Nyro retired , repulsed by the business end of the music business . ( " Money , money , money/ I feel like a pawn , " she wrote in a later song . ) <p> Because her songs , like their era , were dotted with drug references , Nyro was widely assumed to be a user , and many fans speculated that addiction had forced her into seclusion . By all accounts , however , while she experimented with drugs  --  cocaine and LSD , but never heroin  --  they played no larger role in her life . <p> Instead , she left the stage for love , marrying a carpenter , David Bianchini , and moving from her Manhattan penthouse to a cottage in a Massachusetts fishing town . <p> " It was totally predictable , " said Ms. LaBelle , who met Nyro in 1971 when they recorded an album together .

" We 'd eat and drink wine , and then lie on the floor , and I 'd put my head on her chunky little body , and we 'd just make up songs . " <p> The 1970 's were a decade of major life events for Nyro . She married and divorced . She had a child . Her mother , Gilda Nigro , in a sad foreshadowing , died of ovarian cancer at 49 . And she quietly moved into a lesbian social world , meeting Ms. Desiderio in 1977 . <p> Nyro went on and off the road and issued occasional albums , her voice richer than ever . She performed sporadically , and usually in places that granted her total control over her performance . She could not be persuaded to banter , for instance , or to sing Christmas music in her regular Christmas Eve show at the Bottom Line . <p> As she was undergoing treatment for cancer , Nyro oversaw the compilation of a two-disk greatest-hits album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picnic , " released just before her death . This involved arguing with Columbia Records over the tracks they chose , and the lineup , but it also allowed her to review the totality of her work in her final days . <p> " There was much aggravation , , " Ms. Desiderio said . " But by the end , she felt very full circle with her work . " <p> In one of her final outings , Nyro traveled to the Beacon Theater to see Chaka Khan , whom she adored . Not long afterward , she asked her family to plant a Japanese maple outside her bedroom window , which was to grow as she faded . <p> After Nyro died , Ms. Desiderio , heartened by an inundation of flowers and condolence letters , nonetheless withdrew into mourning . <p> His own calls unanswered , Mr. Nigro brought a bouquet of flowers to their home last Mother 's Day , but the door went unanswered .
