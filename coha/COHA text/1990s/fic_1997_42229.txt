Stephen Dedman 's first novel , The Art of Arrow Cutting , has just been published to good reviews . That novel blends fantasy and thriller genres , but in the following story Mr. Dedman gives us straightforward SF . I wanted to write about sane scientists , " he writes us from his native Australia . " I 've only ever met one mad scientist-an entomologist with an enthusiasm for Madagascar cockroachesand even he may have been merely eccentric . " Mad ? Sane ? Who can say what 's in the box ?

It must have been at least ninety outside already , and even the insects looked exhausted , but the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumpy cumuli , randomly scattered through the bone-dry air . We 'd spent much of the night before watching the lightning , betting on how it would fork and expecting it to rain . It had n't . Chalk up another victory for Chaos Theory . I passed up the hotel breakfast in favor of coffee in the Green Room . DefDep was picking up my tab , but good , freshly brewed coffee always tastes vaguely wrong to me . Szymczyk , Schwartz , and Fukushima were still sitting around the table in the comer , arguing about turbulence and weather control and butterfly effects , as they had been at the last two conferences ; Fuku paused long enough to grunt a greeting . The coffee was bitter and corrosive and exactly what I needed . I poured a little cream into it , watching it swirl and break up into fractal patterns . When I looked up , Cassidy was sitting at the table nearby , wearing a garish NASA T-shirt . With her dress sense and those breasts , it 's no wonder she ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " I murmured , politely . " I 'm looking forward to your paper , " she replied , opening a can of something that looked horribly healthy . I shrugged . I was n't due to deliver my paper until tomorrow , but it may have been a non sequitur . I finished my coffee , glanced at my watch - 9:37 - and reached into my briefcase for my copy of the program . It was n't there . I yawned , and walked over to the conference center . The traffic was heavier than I 'd expected , this late on a Friday , even for a town where the malls do n't open until ten . I wandered around the halls , reading the program outside each room . It was all obvious stuff , and most of the names were unfamiliar . All of the really good work being done in the field is still classified . I stepped back and leaned against a pillar , reaching into my jacket pocket for my notebook and the list of possibles . I was still fumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubly soJ when a fortyish woman in a maroon uniform passed in front of me , removing the program cards and replacing them with new ones . Curious , I wandered back and looked again . Fool woman had put Saturday 's program up a day early . I caught up with her , and told her so , and she glanced at me , early morning irritation on her broad brown face . " This is Saturday ... " she said , patiently , as though talking to a child , and then added , " Doctor . " I stood there , refusing to believe I could have misplaced a day . Physicists have a reputation for absent-mindedness and eccentricity , true ; Feigenbaum spent a long time experimenting with twenty-six hour days , and Einstein often forgot his own address , but I ca n't claim the excuse of genius ; I 'm a lecturer and administrator , I have classes and meetings and deadlines every other day . I glanced at the notebook again , and punched up the chronograph function , a little hesitantly . Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagged against the pillar , and tried to think . " Morning , Peter , " came an annoyingly cheerful voice from a few feet away . " Head-hunting again ? " I looked up . My confusion must have shown on my face , and stimulated Cortese 's minuscule compassion circuit . " Something wrong ? " he asked , softly . I straightened my shoulders as best I could . How much could be wrong , after all ? I had n't had any commitments on Friday - a few papers I would have liked to have heard , but I had the abstracts . I could remember Thursday pretty well , and I 'd known it was Thursday . I 'd attended the opening address , all the telltales of Thursdayness had been apparent . " I 'm okay , " I replied . " A little jet-lag , maybe . I should be used to it , by now . " The Jesuit bastard snorted . " Not a hangover ? " " Did I get drunk last night ? " I asked , before I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? The Bomb and Novelty Shop does n't try to ply me with flaming Lamborghinis , or B-52s , or Wargasms , or whatever they call " em . You sure you 're okay ? " I nodded , and stood . I was shaky , sure , but my mouth is usually the first to tell me when I 've downed too many cocktails , and it said I had n't . " I 'm fine , " I said , almost believing it . The maid had tidied my room by the time I returned . My program book was sitting on the bed , and I grabbed it on my way to the bathroom , and sat on the bidet by mistake . I was n't accustomed to this sort of opulence ; there was even a small TV monitor on the marble bench near the handbasin . It was a far cry from the bathroom at my parents " home , or the even worse one at the rooming house I 'd stayed in as an undergraduate , or the graffiti-splattered ablutions block at the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at myself in the mirror , cautiously . I 've never been good looking , but I knew how to wear a suit and knot a necktie better than ninety percent of physicists . I hated these conferences , hated leaving my familiar labs and lecture theaters and offices , even if there was a TV in the bathroom and someone to make my bed for me . I looked at Friday 's abstracts . I had n't made any notes , nothing that would remind me of where I 'd been . I swore , stood , flushed the toilet , and zipped my trousers up . I opened a drawer to find a new tie , and saw the gun . For a moment , I thought - hoped - that I 'd walked into the wrong room , but that was so improbable that I rejected it immediately . I stared at the gun-a smallish revolver with a short barrel and rubber grip . It did n't look familiar ; my father had owned a shotgun , and taught me to use it , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never handled a pistol before . Never felt the need . I broke it , and emptied the cylinder into my palm . Four bullets , and one spent cartridge . Why the hell would I have bought a pistol ? Pistols are only good for killing people , and I could n't think of anybody I wanted to kill ... well , nobody in Florida , anyway . I sniffed the muzzle . It smelt clean , well-kept , and it had n't been used in the past few hours . I sat there for a moment , wondering what the hell to do next , and then I dropped the offending item on the bed and collected a paper bag from the bathroom , a handkerchief from the drawer , and the stapler from my briefcase . I wiped gun and bullets clean of fingerprints , and then dumped them into the bag , which I stapled shut . The bag went into my suitcase , and I made a mental note to throw the whole mess into a lake before I had to fly out . DELIVERED MY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping that nobody would ask any questions I could n't field . Nobody did ; maybe nobody was sufficiently interested . I caught up with Cassidy in the corridor outside . " Lunch ? " I panted . She looked startled . " Are you free for lunch ? " I repeated . " On me ? " The startled look faded into wild suspicion . Finally , she nodded . " There 's a sushi bar up International Drive . You have a car ? " " Yes - over at the Peabody . " " Okay . " There was still some uncertainty there . " Did you have other plans ? " " No , I 'm just - a little taken aback . Are you okay ? " I shrugged . " A little stressed , I guess . That , and jet lag . Nothing serious . " " When was the last time you had a vacation ? " " I hate vacations , " I replied , automatically . Actually , that was true . Half of my colleagues had taken at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other playgrounds ; I had n't even found the way to the hotel swimming pool Cassidy shook her head , tut-tutting like my Jewish grandmother . " When did you come to that conclusion ? What do you do in the summer ? " " Work . " I tried to keep it light . " DepDef does n't believe in holidays . Eternal vigilance is the price we , etc. , etc . " " Christmas ? " I grimaced . " I go and see my family . Sometimes . " " When you ca n't avoid it ? " she asked , gently . " We do n't get on that well , " I explained . " They 're still living in the town where I grew up , and I hate the place . " I blinked . I could n't remember ever telling anybody that before , and I felt as though I 'd given away classified information . " Any hobbies ? " " Uh ... I like flying , especially gliders , but I have n't done that in - " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . " " What did you enjoy as a kid ? " I shrugged . " Nothing . I hated it ; could n't wait to grow up . " " I suppose you hate sushi , too ? " " I 've never tried it , " I admitted . She smiled . " Let 's go . " I switched the radio on as soon as we were in the car , to try to postpone any further conversation , and caught the local news headlines , and that 's how I heard about the murder . " Friend of yours ? " Cassidy asked , softly . " What ? " I jumped , and nearly steered the TransAm into the side of an old Lumina . The driver flipped me the finger ; her red nails were over an inch long , and viciously curved . " The Father ... the victim . Did you know him ? " It was only a few blocks to the restaurant ; if it were n't for the heat , we 'd have been better off walking . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vaguely ... " Cassidy laughed , and tried  --  unsuccessfully - to disguise it as a cough . " What 's funny ? " " Sorry . " Rings a bell , " and him being a priest ... I should n't have laughed . " The restaurant was visible now . " I knew a Father York , yes , " I said , as I parked the car . " He was our parish priest , when I was a boy . I never knew his first name . I suppose it could be the same man ... " I let go the wheel , trying not to let my hands shake . I told myself not to jump to conclusions , that I did n't have enough data , that there was such a thing as coincidence , that a hunch or a feeling was n't proof ... it did n't work very well . " Who 'd want to murder a priest ? " Cassidy asked , innocently . Instead of answering , I opened the door and stepped out into the Florida sunlight . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , but she was quicker . " Something is wrong , is n't it ? " " No , of course not . " She slammed the door and swore at me . " Peter , if you think I 'm going to sit opposite you for an hour and try to guess what is going on inside you like you were some sort of Schrodinger 's bloody cat , and waste a perfectly good sashimi platter into the bargain " She ran out of breath before she ran out of fury , and spluttered at me for a few seconds before remembering to inhale . " I gave you the benefit of the doubt ; you 've never tried to recruit me before , so I assumed it was n't that , and I did n't think you 'd waste your time trying to seduce me ; you could do a lot better . Okay . You want to talk ? Then talk ! " I had to laugh . Cassidy is barely five feet tall , and very stocky , with short curly hair ; she looked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long was it since I read that book ? Thirty years ? ) . A second later , she joined in the laughter . When we 'd finished , she leaned back against the TransAm and snapped , " Well ? " " Do you remember seeing me yesterday ? " She stared at me . " What ? " " I 'm serious . It 's important . I really ca n't remember . " She blinked , and then shrugged . " I remember better on a full stomach . You look like you 'd better eat something , too . Come on . My treat . " I could n't bring myself to eat raw fish , so Cassidy assured me that the katsudon was safe . To my relief , we did n't have to remove our shoes , or use chopsticks , and we were escorted to a paper-walled booth that reminded me of a confessional . " You were n't in the green room yesterday morning , " Cassidy mused , after the waitress brought us cups of yellow , salty tea . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the Space Center until four or five-and I do n't remember seeing you in the evening , but that does n't mean much . " " Thanks . " She looked at me over the rim of her soup bowl , and obviously decided not to ask me the next question . " Any progress with the frequency doubling ? " I asked . The look became wary . Cassidy knows that DefDep is very interested in her work on blue lasers ( she 's interested in the micro-surgical applications ; they want EMP-proof computers ) , and she rightly suspects they 'd pay a lot to have it classified . " No . Why ? " " Just curious . " " You do n't expect us to succeed , do you ? " I tried to spear one of the white soft cubes in my soup , and decided it was n't worth the effort . " You 're working with very limited resources , " I evaded . Cassidy 's a much better physicist than I am , but the days when you could make even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars are long gone ; the cold fusion debacle proved that . " I wish you luck , of course . " " At least we 're not trying anything physically impossible . " " S.D.I. was n't impossible . " Okay , so some of our satellites have to be repaired and re-deployed , some of our rockets still blow up on the launch pad , none of the nukes we 've launched accidentally have ever detonated , and we bombed the French Embassy in Libya and our British allies in Kuwait ; I 'm sure that we could have made the system work , if we 'd had unlimited resources and maybe a couple of centuries , and who was I to say it would n't have been worth the effort ? " Besides , it did for lasers what World War II did for avionics ; without it , this conference would n't be happening ... " " Does that justify it ? " I shrugged . What would the money have been spent on otherwise ! Stealth bombers that did n't fly ? Cruise missiles that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled fusion , or the civilian space program . Of that , I was sure . I told the hotel manager that I 'd lost a 3 " floppy of valuable but not classified ) data ; I did n't accuse anybody of having taken it , of course , but I told him that I wanted to know which maid had cleaned my room on Friday , and when , in case she 'd seen it . He told me . She 'd cleaned the room between 10:10 and 10:35 , and I had n't been there . I sat in the room for a while , staring at the bag with the gun inside , wondering where the hell it could have come from . How easy was it to buy a handgun in Florida ? Was there a waiting period ? I 'd seen the " No Firearms Permitted " signs in the parks and outside the cinemas ... Eventually , I tore the bag open and had a closer look at the gun . The bullets were .38 Special ; there were probably half a million guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York had been shot with anything else , I was in the clear . Unfortunately , I did n't know any safe way of finding out ; my security clearance did n't extend to routine forensics , somebody would want to know why I wanted to know . I stared at the gun for another moment , my hands shaking , and then carefully wiped it clean again and took another bag from the bathroom . After all , I told myself , I could n't have been the only one with a motive . It 'd been more than thirty years , nobody had believed me at the time ; even if I 'd been the first , there must have been others later ... I lay down on the bed , and tried to think . My last memory of Thursday night  --  actually Friday morning - was the General Dynamics cocktail party . I 'd been arguing with a couple of Oxonians about the English " friendly fire " casualties in the Gulf , and Lippincott had rescued me ; I 'd left just after two , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay . And York , according to the local papers , had been shot sometime Thursday afternoon . That should have meant I was in the clear , and there was no need to get into a flap , but ... Okay , I thought . I do n't remember Friday , but I do remember Thursday . I do n't remember seeing York-hell , I did n't even know he was living in Florida , though I could 've guessed he 'd retired if I 'd bothered thinking about it . I certainly do n't remember buying a gun ... I stared at the bag . I might never know whether I 'd bought it or not , unless I 'd used my Visa card , and I would n't have done that if I 'd been planning to kill somebody ... Or it might have been York 's gun . I might have found it there . But why would I visit Father York ? I stared at the bag again , and knew there was only one reason . But I could n't have visited York . Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not being seen by anybody in that time ... not impossible , and it still did n't meant I 'd disappeared completely ... But disappearing Friday , and being in two places at once on Thursday ... for Christ 's sake , that was time travel ! Nobody believes in time travel , not even chaos theorists or science fiction writers . And even if it was possible , it 'd take enormous amounts of energy , billions of dollars of equipment , not just one third-rate laser man wanting to kill the man who 'd abused him as a boy But I could n't shake the feeling that I 'd done it , that I 'd killed the bastard . I did n't know it , the way I know my name or the speed of light in a vacuum , and I was sure no one could prove it , and I did n't feel guilty , but ... I sat there shaking for what felt like hours , then stapled the bag shut , dropped it into my briefcase , removed my name badge , and walked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swampland ) ; finding a Catholic church more difficult . I guess I should 've tried the phonebook before I left the hotel . The place I finally found was small and shabby , a concrete blockhouse with an unpaved car-park , barely distinguishable from the topless bar across the road . Inside , it was dark , and almost miraculously cool . The confessional was empty , and I sat down and pulled the curtain shut , sealing myself inside like Schrodinger 's cat . " Bless me Father , for I have sinned , " I mumbled . " It has been ... " Oh , Jesus , " uh , thirty years since my last confession . " Silence . " Thirty-one , " I said , after a quick calculation . " My sins are ... A. . . " I think I killed somebody . " There was a long silence , then a soft , vaguely feminine voice suggested , " Tell me about it . " I stared at the screen . Granted , it 'd been nearly thirty years since I 'd set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any female Catholic priests . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I can barely hear you . " " Is this better ? " The voice was louder , but no deeper . It sounded a little like my sister , a little more like Cassidy . Maybe it was n't a female voice at all , just an accent . At least it was easier to listen to than York 's Southside Chicago growl . " I think I killed a priest , " I said . " A Catholic priest . " Another silence . " You 're not sure ? " " I do n't remember doing it , " I replied . There seemed no point in adding that I was somewhere else at the time . " Then why do you think you killed someone ? " " That 's not all I do n't remember , " I said , glumly . " I do n't remember buying a gun , either - but there was a gun in my room this morning . I do n't remember shooting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " " Why do you think it was you ? " " Because I had a motive . " " Were you the only one ? " " I do n't know . " " Could there have been two other people who wanted to kill him ? " " Yes , maybe . " " More than two ? " " I do n't know . " " Five more ? Seven ? Nine ? " I hated the idea , but it was certainly possible . " Maybe . " " Maybe more ? " " I do n't know ! " " And they could have done it ? " " Yes , I guess so ... " " So , " said the voice . " There 's maybe a one-in-ten chance that you killed somebody . Maybe one in twenty , maybe one in a hundred . " I sat there , and digested that . How did you calculate the probability of time travel ? Was n't it much more likely that someone else had shot him ? " Yes , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than that . " " What do you do for a living , my son ? " I started : what the hell did that have to do with anything ? " What ? " " What 's your job ? What do you do ? " " I 'm a scientist , " I said . " A physicist . Why ? " " What do you do ? " " I 'm an assistant professor . " I said . " I lecture , take a few classes , do a little research , and write a third-rate paper every now and then . And I recruit better physicists for DefDep Department of Defense-projects . I guess that 's all . " " Have you done anything good ? " I thought about that . " I did some pretty good work on CAT - Clear Air Turbulence-back in the eighties . Nothing very deep , but it was nonclassified , and well received ; it 's still being cited occasionally , mostly by chaos theorists , and I guess it got me the DefDep job . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speciality ? " " Laser guided weaponry , " I replied before I had time to wonder whether or not I should . " And the weapons you help build , " said the voice , " have they been used ? " " Yes . " " They 've killed people ? " " Yes ... I mean ... " " How many People ? Hundreds ? Thousands ? " What the hell ? " I do n't know , " I said , warily . " I 've no data - no evidence . Maybe they 've saved lives , too . We 're making the weapons more accurate - okay , maybe that makes them more deadly , but we kill fewer civilians , fewer of our own people , I think that 's a worthwhile goal " I mean , back when Reagan wanted Libya bombed , " precision bombing " meant that they hit the right city . Okay , they hit Gadaffi 's home , but they also hit the French Embassy . Now , look at the Gulf War . Precision bombing " meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . " At least , I admitted silently , those were the ones we showed on TV .... " If I have to take my share - and it 'd be a microscopic share - of the blame for anybody who died in those bunkers , okay , I 'll take it . I mean , the weapons did n't cause the war , it still would 've been fought without them ... " Or would it ? I wondered , silently . Would Iraq have invaded Kuwait if it had n't had the weapons left over from the war with Iran ? What would we have done if it had n't looked like such an easy victory ? Anyway , that was war , not murder , and it had n't been my decision to ... " What about the " friendly fire " casualties ? " I opened my mouth to speak again , and then closed it . " Accidents are inevitable , " I said . " Especially if you ca n't actually see your target , and have to rely on circumstantial evidence to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't men fragging their officers , the way it was in Vietnam .. " " Are they inevitable ? Even with more accurate weapons ? " " Hell , yes ! Even if you can pick out a target with a laser ... it never works quite the way it would in a model . The air is never completely clear , or completely still , and you ca n't predict what it 'll do to the beam , there 's always butterfly effects , and the missile is much slower than the beam and even more prone to turbulence , to chaos .... We 're very close to the theoretical limits of accuracy already . " " Why do you do it ? " " Do what ? " " Weapons work . " " It 's my job . It 's what I 'm - " I stopped . " What I 'm good at " was n't particularly accurate , and " what I 'm paid for " did n't seem adequate , not when I was being accused ( was I being accused ? of murder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't still be built , and used , if I quit , or that I was going to make some great contribution to physics ... I was still hunting for the right words when the voice asked , " What 's a butterfly effect ? " " Huh ? It 's ... it 's an idea from Chaos Theory . A statistically trivial event with significant repercussions . Like a butterfly flapping its wings in China changing wind patterns and causing a hurricane in Florida ... but I think the name really comes from an old Ray Bradbury story . A time traveler treads on a butterfly in the Cretaceous and changes the future . " A Sound of Thunder . " " " One butterfly can make that much difference ? " I laughed . " Theoretically . It 's a thought experiment , like Schrodinger 's Cat . But if it 's in the right place at the right time ... " I remembered why I was here , and stopped laughing , very suddenly . There was silence on the other side of the grille . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Still , silence . " What 's my penance ? " I whispered , but there was only silence , and when I found the courage to open the booth and look inside , it was empty . DefDep was less than delighted by my resignation , especially when I said I was going to be working on blue lasers with Cassidy . Maybe I should 've told them I believed in time travel , that I knew it was possible if we had the resources and maybe a couple of centuries , and who was I to say it would n't have been worth the effort ? ; they would 've been much happier to get rid of me . I 'm sure they were far more upset when Fukushima resigned from the Weapons Division , only a month later . Maybe I 've started something ... Cassidy 's stopped asking about that Friday or was it a Thursday ) last August ; after all , I 've got days to spare , now . Sometimes I work at the lab . Sometimes I go flying . Sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or timely inventions have changed the world , and how narrowly catastrophes have been averted . But usually , I just sit on my balcony , and watch the butterflies blow the clouds around .
