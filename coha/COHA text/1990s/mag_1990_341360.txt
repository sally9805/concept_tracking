General Miguel Maza Marquez narrows his hard brown eyes when he mentions his quarry . " He 's somewhere in Medellin , and very soon we 'll get him . " The chief of Colombia 's secret police , or DAS , has been offering that prediction for nearly a year . But each time authorities announce that the capture of Pablo Escobar Gaviria is imminent , the overlord of the Medellin drug cartel slithers away . Just last week Escobar managed to elude the police once again after a massive drug raid in the northeastern part of the country . But 11 top advisers of his drug ring , including his brother-in-law , were not so lucky and have been detained . <P> After 11 months of all-out war , the government of President Virgilio Barco Vargas has damaged but not destroyed Escobar 's multibillion-dollar empire . Since last August , when cartel hit men murdered presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan , dozens of cocaine laboratories have been torched , one top drug baron has been killed , hundreds of suspects have been arrested , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Escobar has unleashed a campaign of terror that has claimed some 300 civilian lives . After two successive weekends of violence in Medellin took more than 40 lives , the government two weeks ago extradited two more suspected cartel money launderers to the U.S. , reaffirming Colombia 's will to win the war . <P> Yet cartel profits remain solid , and Colombia is still the undisputed axis of cocaine trafficking . " It 's an extraordinarily exhausting and frustrating fight , " says a Western diplomat in Bogota , " and it 's nowhere near being over . " The stalemate raises questions about the government 's inability to defeat the bad guys . <P> Why ca n't the 200,000 members of the Colombian armed forces and police defeat the cartels ? The top-heavy law-enforcement agencies were not designed to be a narcotics strike force . According to a secret government report , the army , navy and air force  --  all involved in the drug war  --  are still mainly structured and equipped to repel foreign invaders , not homegrown terrorists . The air force bought fighter jets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dense jungles where drug laboratories are concealed . The navy spent $90 million to repair submarines instead of investing in light powerboats to chase traffickers who infest the country 's rivers . <P> Better coordination is also needed . Last year army troops were closing in on cartel chieftain Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha when an A-37 air force reconnaissance jet buzzed overhead . The aircraft was on an unrelated mission , but it alerted Rodriguez Gacha to the military 's presence , and he escaped . And the explosion of narcoterrorism has diverted manpower : half of DAS 's 3,000 agents guard politicians and judges whose lives are at risk . <P> Why has n't Escobar been found and captured ? Nearly 2,000 national police have been assigned full time to the manhunt , and Escobar is almost certainly hiding in Envigado , a suburb of Medellin . But knowing his whereabouts and bringing him to justice are two different matters . Escobar is well protected in Envigado , which he once represented in congress . Even on the run , he is hard to find in a mainly rural country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
