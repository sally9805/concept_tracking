Even at the edge of the abyss , U.S. policy toward Iraq ran headlong into contradiction with itself . On July 25 , 1990 , as Iraqi tanks and troops were massing along the border of Kuwait , U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie told President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad that the U.S. had little to say about Arab border disputes and was eager to improve relations with Iraq . That same day in Washington , anxious State Department officials urged the Pentagon to dispatch the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Independence and its battle group , then in the Indian Ocean , to the mouth of the Persian Gulf  --  as a signal to Saddam that the U.S. would not sit idly by if Iraq crossed into Kuwait . <P> Days passed . The Joint Chiefs of Staff resisted sending the Independence , arguing that such a force , obviously no more than a token , would be no match for Saddam 's giant war machine . Just before the invasion , with the Iraqi army now poised for assault , the White House overruled the Pentagon 's concerns and ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late to impress Saddam . <P> The episode was typical of a U.S. policy toward Iraq that was marked by mixed signals , interagency disputes , intelligence failures , errors of judgment and flights of wishful thinking . Behind the specific failures lurked  --  and still lurks  --  a general policy dilemma the U.S. has yet to resolve : Must America dance with the devil to promote its strategic interests ? When is the enemy of your enemy your friend ? <P> While it took months for Desert Shield to be transformed into Desert Storm , U.S. policymakers were scrambling for cover within days of the invasion , trying to defend their actions from the harsh judgments of hindsight . The great " Who lost Kuwait ? " debate was on . Revisionism was rampant . But what was clear was that the roots of a failed policy went back more than a decade . The American embrace of Saddam Hussein began on Nov. 4 , 1979 , when the Islamic revolutionaries who had overthrown the Shah of Iran seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 66 Americans hostage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic fundamentalism would spread throughout the region  --  became the driving force behind U.S. policy not only toward Iran but Iraq as well . Three U.S. administrations and both political parties shared responsibility for this view . <P> 1 " A Counterbalance To the Iranians " <P> Says Graham Fuller , a Middle East specialist with the CIA during the 1980s : " There was a genuine visceral fear of Islam in Washington as a force that was utterly alien to American thinking , and that really scared us . Senior people at the Pentagon and elsewhere were much more concerned about Islam than communism . It was an almost obsessive fear , leading to a mentality on our part that you should use any stick to beat a dog  --  to stop the advance of Islamic fundamentalism . " That stick was to be Iraq .
