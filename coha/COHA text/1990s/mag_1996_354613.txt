ECONOMISTS AND CORPORATE EXECUTIVES ARE NOT USUALLY thought of as disciples of Dr. Victor Frankenstein . But they too have created a monster , and it has suddenly found a voice  --  not Boris Karloff 's this time , but Pat Buchanan 's . In his strident demands for trade protection can be heard the long-mute anger of workers who feel both injured and insulted by free traders in the academy , business and politics : injured by the loss of jobs and income to foreign competition ; insulted because too many free traders have airily dismissed their pain as either illusory or inconsequential . <P> Which does not make Buchanan 's arguments right . The wage stagnation and job insecurity he decries result much more from low growth in domestic R. and D. spending , productivity and investment than from trade . Moreover , his proposals to raise tariffs sharply and pull the U.S. out of international trade agreements would cause much more economic pain than they would ease . Liberal trade policies have created more  --  and better  --  jobs in export industries than they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the much despised movement of American factories to Mexico and other low-wage countries has been offset  --  in job creation , though not in hoopla-by the opening of foreign  --  owned plants in the U.S. It would take a string of Mexican maquiladoras to match the Honda plants in Ohio that employ 11,200 workers . <P> Buchanan and his admirers , however , focus on a dark underside of the picture that is often neglected . The number of jobs lost to foreign competition is hard to pin down ; Buchanan 's estimate of 300,000 wiped out as a result of the NAFTA treaty with Mexico and Canada seems plucked out of thin air . To the losers , though , it is a statistical abstraction to argue that the losses have been more than offset by job gains in export industries . Honda 's success in Ohio does nothing to help Watsonville , California ( pop . 33,798 ) , where the unemployment rate has jumped to close to 20% . A number of vegetable-freezing plants there have shut down , and the owners of some have moved operations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too-an effect foreseen by Karl Marx , who predicted in 1848 that it would intensify strains between bourgeoisie and proletariat and thus speed a revolution . In a TIME/CNN poll last week , 58% of those surveyed thought free-trade agreements were " mostly good " for U.S. corporations , but 51% thought the effects for workers were " mostly bad . " <P> Not so , say most economists . C. Fred Bergsten , director of the Institute for International Economics , figures that export jobs pay about 15% to 20% more than nonexport jobs . He adds , " Whatever Buchanan saves for Roger Milliken a major textile employer in South Carolina , he loses for Boeing , " which is heavily dependent on aircraft exports . " And Boeing jobs pay so much more than textile jobs that this would be a net loss for the U.S. " <P> That , however , is a tough argument to sell to textile workers . The overall economic gains also come at the price of a modest but significant increase in wage inequality , since most of the competitive pressure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economist at Harvard 's John F. Kennedy School of Government , figures foreign competition has accounted for one-fourth of the widening gap between the wages of high school dropouts and those paid to college graduates over the past 20 years .
