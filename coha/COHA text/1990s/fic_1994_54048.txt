QUEE LEE 'S APARTMENT covered several hectares within one of the human districts , some thousand kilometers beneath the ship 's hull . It was n't a luxury unit by any measure . Truly wealthy people owned as much as a cubic kilometer for themselves and their entourages . But it had been her home since she had come on board , for more centuries than she could count , its hallways and large rooms as comfortable to her as her own body . <p> The garden room was a favorite . She was enjoying its charms one afternoon , lying nude beneath a false sky and sun , eyes closed and nothing to hear but the splash of fountains and the prattle of little birds . Suddenly her apartment interrupted the peace , announcing a visitor . " He has come for Perri , miss . He claims it 's most urgent . " <p> " Perri is n't here , " she replied , soft gray eyes opening . " Unless he 's hiding from both of us , I suppose . " <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause , then the voice said , " I have explained this to the man , but he refuses to leave . His name is Orleans . He claims that Perri owes him a considerable sum of money . " <p> What had her husband done now ? Quee Lee could guess , halfway smiling as she sat upright . Oh , Perri . . . . wo n't you learn . . . . ? She would have to dismiss this Orleans fellow herself , spooking him with a good hard stare . She rose and dressed in an emerald sarong , then walked the length of her apartment , never hurrying , commanding the front door to open at the last moment but leaving the security screen intact . And she was ready for someone odd . Even someone sordid , knowing Peru . Yet she did n't expect to see a shiny lifesuit more than two meters tall and nearly half as wide , and she had never imagined such a face gazing down at her with mismatched eyes . It took her along moment to realize this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public walkway , his vivid round face watching her . The flesh was orange with diffuse black blotches that might or might not be cancers , and a lipless , toothless mouth seemed to flow into a grin . What would bring a Remora here ? They never , never came down here . . . ! <p> " I 'm Orleans . " The voice was sudden and deep , slightly muted by the security screen . It came from a speaker hidden somewhere on the thick neck , telling her , " I need help , miss . I 'm sorry to disturb you . . . but you see , I 'm desperate . I do n't know where else to turn . " <p> Quee Lee knew about Remoras . She had seen them and even spoken to a few , although those conversations were eons ago and she could n't remember their substance . Such strange creatures . Stranger than most aliens , even if they possessed human souls . . . . <p> " Miss ? " <p> Quee Lee thought of herself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but feel repelled , the floor rolling beneath her and her breath stopping short . Orleans was a human being , one of her own species . True , his genetics had been transformed by hard radiations . And yes , he normally lived apart from ordinary people like her . But inside him was a human mind , tough and potentially immortal . Quee Lee blinked and remembered that she had compassion as well as charity for everyone , even aliens . . . and she managed to sputter , " Come in . " She said , " If you wish , please do , " and with that invitation , her apartment deactivated the invisible screen . <p> " Thank you , miss . " The Remora walked slowly , almost clumsily , his lifesuit making a harsh grinding noise in the knees and hips . That was n't normal , she realized . Orleans should be graceful , his suit powerful , serving him as an elaborate exoskeleton . <p> " Would you like anything ? " she asked foolishly . Out of habit . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice nothing but pleasant . <p> Of course . Remoras ate and drank only self-made concoctions . They were permanently sealed inside their lifesuits , functioning as perfectly self-contained organisms . Food was synthesized , water recycled , and they <p> possessed a religious sense of purity and independence . <p> " I do n't wish to bother you , miss . I 'll be brief . " <p> His politeness was a minor surprise . Remoras typically were distant , even arrogant . But Orleans continued to smile , watching her . One eye was a muscular pit filled with thick black hairs , and she assumed those hairs were light sensitive . Like an insect 's compound eye , each one might build part of an image . By contrast , its mate was ordinary , white and fishy with a foggy black center . Mutations could do astonishing things . An accelerated , partly controlled evolution was occurring inside that suit , even while Orleans stood before her , boots stomping on the stone floor , a single spark arcing toward her . Orleans said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , " she offered . <p> "  --  and it makes me uncomfortable too . I would n't have come down here if it was n't necessary . " <p> " Perri 's gone , " she repeated , " and I do n't know when he 'll be back . I 'm sorry . " <p> " Actually , " said Orleans , " I was hoping he would be gone . " <p> " Did you ? " <p> " Though I 'd have come either way . " <p> Quee Lee 's apartment , loyal and watchful , would n't allow anything nasty to happen to her . She took a step forward , closing some of the distance . " This is about money being owed ? Is that right ? " <p> " Yes , miss . " <p> " For what , if I might ask ? " <p> Orleans did n't explain in clear terms . " Think of it as an old gambling debt . " More was involved , he implied . " A very old debt , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . " <p> She could imagine it . Her husband had his share of failings , incompetence and a self-serving attitude among them . She loved Perri in a controlled way , but his flaws were obvious . " I 'm sorry , " she replied , " but I 'm not responsible for his debts . " She made herself sound hard , knowing it was best . " I hope you did n't come all this way because you heard he was married . " Married to a woman of some means , she thought to herself . In secret . <p> " No , no , no ! " The grotesque face seemed injured . Both eyes became larger , and a thin tongue , white as ice , licked at the lipless edge of the mouth . " Honestly , we do n't follow the news about passengers . I just assumed Perri was living with someone . I know him , you see . . . my hope was to come and make my case to whomever I found , winning a comrade . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A hopeful pause , then he said , " When Perri does come here , will you explain to him what 's right and what is not ? Can you , please ? " Another pause , then he added , " Even a lowly Remora knows the difference between right and wrong miss . " <p> That was n't fair , calling himself lowly . And he seemed to be painting her as some flavor of bigot , which she was n't . She did n't look at him as lowly , and morality was n't her private possession . Both of them were human , after all . Their souls were linked by a charming and handsome , manipulative user . . . by her darling husband . . . and Quee Lee felt a sudden anger directed at Perri , almost shuddering in front of this stranger . <p> " Miss ? " <p> " How much ? " she asked . " How much does he owe you , and how soon will you need it ? " <p> Orleans answered the second question first , lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Can you hear it ? " he asked . As if she were deaf . " My seals need to be replaced , or at least refurbished . Yesterday , if possible . " The arm bent , and the elbow whined . " I already spent my savings rebuilding my reactor . " <p> Quee Lee knew enough about lifesuits to appreciate his circumstances . Remoras worked on the ship 's hull , standing in the open for hours and days at a time . A broken seal was a disaster . Any tiny opening would kill most of his body , and his suffering mind would fall into a protective coma . Left exposed and vulnerable , Orleans would be at the mercy of radiation storms and comet showers . Yes , she understood . A balky suit was an unacceptable hazard on top of lesser hazards , and what could she say ? <p> She felt a deep empathy for the man . <p> Orleans seemed to take a breath , then he said , " Perri owes me fifty-two thousand credits , miss . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " My name is Quee Lee . " <p> " Quee Lee , " he repeated . " Yes , miss . " <p> " As soon as Perri comes home , I 'll discuss this with him . I promise you . " <p> " I would be grateful if you did . " <p> " I will . " <p> The ugly mouth opened , and she saw blotches of green and gray-blue against a milky throat . Those were cancers or perhaps strange new organs . She could n't believe she was in the company of a Remora  --  the strangest sort of human  --  yet despite every myth , despite tales of courage and even recklessness , Orleans appeared almost fragile . He even looked scared , she realized . That wet orange face shook as if in despair , then came the awful grinding noise as he turned away , telling her , " Thank you , Quee Lee . For your time and patience , and for everything . " <p> Fifty-two thousand credits ! <p> She could have screamed . She would scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done this man a great disservice , and he 'd hear about it when he graced her with his company again . A patient person , yes , and she could tolerate most of his flaws . But not now . Fifty thousand credits was no fortune , and it would allow Orleans to refurbish his lifesuit , making him whole and healthy again . Perhaps she could get in touch with Perri first , speeding up the process . . . ? <p> Orleans was through her front door , turning to say good-bye . False sunshine made his suit shine , and his faceplate darkened to where she could n't see his features anymore . He might have any face , and what did a face mean ? Waving back at him , sick to her stomach , she calculated what fifty-two thousand credits meant in concrete terms , to her . . . . <p> . . . wondering if she should . . . ? <p> But no , she decided . She just lacked the required compassion . She was a particle short , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping to mute that horrid grinding of joints as the Remora shuffled off for home . <p> The ship had many names , many designations , but to its long-term passengers and crew it was referred to as the ship . No other starship could be confused for it . Not in volume , nor in history . <p> The ship was old by every measure . A vanished humanoid race had built it , probably before life arose on Earth , then abandoned it for no obvious reason . Experts claimed it had begun as a sunless world , one of the countless jupiters that sprinkled the cosmos . The builders had used the world 's own hydrogen to fuel enormous engines , accelerating it over millions of years while stripping away its gaseous exterior . Today 's ship was the leftover core , much modified by its builders and humans . Its metal and rock interior was laced with passageways and sealed environments , fuel tanks and various ports . There was room enough for hundreds of billions of passengers , though there were only a fraction that number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hyperfibers , kilometers thick and tough enough to withstand most high-velocity impacts . <p> The ship had come from outside the galaxy , passing into human space long ago . It was claimed as salvage , explored by various means , then refurbished to the best of its new owners ' abilities . A corporation was formed ; a promotion was born . The ancient engines were coaxed to life , changing the ship 's course . Then tickets were sold , both to humans and alien species . Novelty and adventure were the lures . One circuit around the Milky Way ; a half-million-year voyage touring the star-rich spiral arms . It was a long span , even for immortal humans . But people like Quee Lee had enough money and patience . That 's why she purchased her apartment with a portion of her savings . This voyage would n't remain novel for long , she knew . Three or four circuits at most , and then what ? People would want something else new and glancingly dangerous . Was n't that the way it always was ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had improved themselves in a thousand ways , erasing the aging process . Fragile DNAs were replaced with better genetic machinery . Tailoring allowed a wide-range of useful proteins and enzymes and powerful repair mechanisms . Immune systems were nearly perfect ; diseases were extinct . Normal life could n't damage a person in any measurable way . And even a tragic accident would n't need to be fatal , Quee Lee 's body and mind able to withstand frightening amounts of abuse . <p> But Remoras , despite those same gifts , did not live ordinary lives . They worked on the open hull , each of them encased in a lifesuit . The suits afforded extra protection and a standard environment , each one possessing a small fusion plant and redundant recycling systems . Hull life was dangerous in the best times . The ship 's shields and laser watchdogs could n't stop every bit of interstellar grit . And every large impact meant someone had to make repairs . The ship 's builders had used sophisticated robots , but they proved too tired after several billions of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or demote  --  members of the human crew . The original scheme was to share the job , brief stints fairly dispersed . Even the captains were to don the lifesuits , stepping into the open when it was safest , patching craters with fresh-made hyperfibers . . . . <p> Fairness did n't last . A kind of subculture arose , and the first Remoras took the hull as their province . Those early Remoras learned how to survive the huge radiation loads . They trained themselves and their offspring to control their damaged bodies . Tough genetics mutated , and they embraced their mutations . If an eye was struck blind , perhaps by some queer cancer , then a good Remora would evolve a new eye . Perhaps a hair was light-sensitive , and its owner , purely by force of will , would culture that hair and interface it with the surviving optic nerve , producing an eye more durable than the one it replaced . Or so Quee Lee had heard , in passing , from people who acted as if they knew about such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to look grotesque . In their culture , strange faces and novel organs were the measures of success . And since disaster could happen anytime , without warning , it was unusual for any Remora to live long . At least in her sense of long . Orleans could be a fourth or fifth generation Remora , for all she knew . A child barely fifty centuries old . For all she knew . Which was almost nothing , she realized , returning to her garden room and undressing lying down with her eyes closed and the light baking her . Remoras were important , even essential people , yet she felt wholly ignorant . And ignorance was wrong , she knew . Not as wrong as owing one of them money , but still . . . . <p> This life of hers seemed so ordinary , set next to Orleans ' life . Comfortable and ordinary , and she almost felt ashamed . <p> PERRI FAILED to come home that next day , and the next . Then it was ten days , Quee Lee having sent messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been careful not to explain why she wanted him . And this was nothing too unusual , Perri probably wandering somewhere new and Quee Lee skilled at waiting her days accented with visits from friends and parties thrown for any small reason . It was her normal life , never anything but pleasant ; yet she found herself thinking about Orleans , imagining him walking on the open hull with his seals breaking , his strange body starting to boil away . . . that poor man . . . ! <p> Taking the money to Orleans was an easy decision . Quee Lee had more than enough . It did n't seem like a large sum until she had it converted into black-and-white chips . But was n't it better to have Perri owing her instead of owing a Remora ? She was in a better place to recoup the debt ; and besides , she doubted that her husband could raise that money now . Knowing him , he probably had a number of debts , to humans and aliens both ; and for the nth time , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was she thinking , agreeing to this crazy union ? <p> Quee Lee was old even by immortal measures . She was so old she could barely remember her youth , her tough neurons unable to embrace her entire life . Maybe that 's why Perri had seemed like a blessing . He was ridiculously young and wore his youth well , gladly sharing his enthusiasms and energies . He was a good , untaxing lover ; he could listen when it was important ; and he had never tried milking Quee Lee of her money . Besides , he was a challenge . No doubt about it . Maybe her friends did n't approve of him  --  a few close ones were openly critical  --  but to a woman of her vintage , in the middle of a five thousand century voyage , Perri was something fresh and new and remark . able . And Quee Lee 's old friends , quite suddenly , seemed a little fossilized by comparison . <p> " I love to travel , " Perri had explained , his gently handsome face capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you know ? Just weeks after my parents came on board . They were riding only as far as a colony world , but I stayed behind . My choice . " He had laughed , eyes gazing into the false sky of her ceiling . " Do you know what I want to do ? I want to see the entire ship , walk every hallway and cavern . I want to explore every body of water , meet every sort of alien  --  " <p> " Really ? " <p> "  --  and even visit their quarters . Their homes . " Another laugh and that infectious smile . " I just came back from a low-gravity district , six thousand kilometers below . There 's a kind of spidery creature down there . You should see them , love ! I ca n't do them justice by telling you they 're graceful , and seeing holes is n't much better . " <p> She had been impressed . Who else did she know who could tolerate aliens , what with their strange odors and their impenetrable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even her most critical friends admitted that much , and despite their grumbles , they 'd want to hear the latest Perri adventure as told by his wife . <p> " I 'll stay on board forever , if I can manage it . " <p> She had laughed , asking , " Can you afford it ? " <p> " Badly , " he had admitted . " But I 'm paid up through this circuit , at least . Minus day-by-day expenses , but that 's all right . Believe me , when you 've got millions of wealthy souls in one place , there 's always a means of making a living . " <p> " Legal means ? " <p> " Glancingly so . " He had a rogue 's humor , all right . Yet later , in a more sober mood , he had admitted , " I do have enemies , my love . I 'm warning you . Like anyone , I 've made my share of mistakes  --  my youthful indiscretions  --  but at least I 'm honest about them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to earn her animosity . <p> " We should marry , " Perri had proposed . " Why not ? We like each other 's company , yet we seem to weather our time apart too . What do you think ? Frankly , I do n't think you need a partner who shadows you day and night . Do you , Quee Lee ? " <p> She did n't . True enough . <p> " A small tidy marriage , complete with rules , " he had assured her . " I get a home base , and you have your privacy , plus my considerable entertainment value . " A big long laugh , then he had added , " I promise . You 'll be the first to hear my latest tales . And I 'll never be any kind of leech , darling . With you , I will be the perfect gentleman . " <p> Quee Lee carried the credit chips in a secret pouch , traveling to the tube-car station and riding one of the vertical tubes toward the hull . She had looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Orleans lived at Port Beta , no mention of him being a Remora or not . The ports were vast facilities where taxi craft docked with the ship , bringing new passengers from nearby alien worlds . It was easier to accelerate and decelerate those kilometer-long needles . The ship 's own engines did nothing but make the occasional course correction , avoiding dust clouds while keeping them on their circular course . <p> It had been forever since Quee Lee had visited a port . And today there was n't even a taxi to be seen , all of them off hunting for more paying customers . The nonRemora crew  --  the captains , mates and so on  --  had little work at the moment , apparently hiding from her . She stood at the bottom of the port  --  a lofty cylinder capped with a kilometer-thick hatch of top-grade hyperfibers . The only other tourists were aliens , some kind of fishy species encased in bubbles of liquid water or ammonia . The bubbles rolled past her . It was like standing in a school of small tuna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decipher any of it . Were they mocking her ? She had no clue , and it made her all the more frustrated . They could be making terrible fun of her . She felt lost and more than a little homesick all at once . <p> By contrast , the first Remora seemed normal . Walking without any grinding sounds , it covered ground at an amazing pace . Quee Lee had to run to catch it . To catch her . Something about the lifesuit was feminine , and a female voice responded to Quee Lee 's shouts . <p> " What what what ? " asked the Remora . " I 'm busy ! " <p> Gasping , Quee Lee asked , " Do you know Orleans ? " <p> " Orleans ? " <p> " I need to find him . It 's quite important . " Then she wondered if something terrible had happened , her arriving too late  --  <p> " I do know someone named Orleans , yes . " The face had comma-shaped eyes , huge and black and bulging , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silvery , odd bunched fibers running beneath the surface . Black hair showed along the top of the faceplate , except at second glance it was n't hair . It looked more like ropes soaked in oil , the strands wagging with a slow stately pace . <p> The mouth smiled . The normal-sounding voice said , " Actually , Orleans is one of my closest friends ! " <p> True ? Or was she making a joke ? <p> " I really have to find him , " Quee Lee confessed . <p> " Can you help me ? " " Can I help you ? " The strange mouth smiled , gray pseudoteeth looking big as thumbnails , the gums as silver as her skin . " I 'll take you to him . Does that constitute help ? " And Quee Lee found herself following , walking onto a lifting disk without railing , the Remora standing in the center and waving to the old woman . " Come closer . Orleans is up there . " A skyward gesture . <p> " A good long way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it alone . Would you ? " <p> " Relax , " Orleans advised . <p> She thought she was relaxed , except then she found herself nodding , breathing deeply and feeling a tension as it evaporated . The ascent had taken ages , it seemed . Save for the rush of air moving past her ears , it had been soundless . The disk had no sides at all  --  a clear violation of safety regulations  --  and Quee Lee had grasped one of the Remora 's shiny arms , needing a handhold , surprised to feel rough spots in the hyperfiber . Minuscule impacts had left craters too tiny to see . Remoras , she had realized , were very much like the ship itself  --  enclosed biospheres taking abuse as they streaked through space . <p> " Better ? " asked Orleans . <p> " Yes . Better . " A thirty kilometer ride through the port , holding tight to a Remora . And now this . She and Orleans were inside some tiny room not five hundred meters from the vacuum . Did Orleans live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls and stubby furniture , deciding it was too spare , too ascetic to be anyone 's home . Even his . Instead she asked him , " How are you ? " <p> " Tired . Fresh off my shift , and devastated . " <p> The face had changed . The orange pigments were softer now , and both eyes were the same sickening hair-filled pits . How clear was his vision ? How did he transplant cells from one eye to the other ? There had to be mechanisms , reliable tricks . . . and she found herself feeling ignorant and glad of it . . . . <p> " What do you want , Quee Lee ? " <p> She swallowed . " Perri came home , and I brought what he owes you . " <p> Orleans looked surprised , then the cool voice said , " Good . Wonderful ! " <p> She produced the chips , his shiny palm accepting them . The elbow gave a harsh growl , and she said , " I hope this helps . " <p> " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What else ? She was n't sure what to say now . <p> Then Orleans told her , " I should thank you somehow . Can I give you something for your trouble ? How about a tour ? " One eye actually winked at her , hairs contracting into their pit and nothing left visible but a tiny red pore . " A tour , " he repeated . " A walk outside ? We 'll find you a lifesuit . We keep them here in case a captain comes for an inspection . " A big deep laugh , then he added , " Once every thousand years , they do ! Whether we need it or not ! " <p> What was he saying ? She had heard him , and she had n't . <p> A smile and another wink , and he said , " I 'm serious . Would you like to go for a little stroll ? " <p> " I 've never . . . I do n't know . . . ! " <p> " Safe as safe can be . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safest place for a jaunt . We 're behind the leading face , which means impacts are nearly impossible . But we 're not close to the engines and their radiations either . " Another laugh , and he added , " Oh , you 'll get a dose of radiation , but nothing important . You 're tough , Quee Lee . Does your fancy apartment have an autodoc ? " <p> " Of course . " <p> " Well , then . " <p> She was n't scared , at least in any direct way . What Quee Lee felt was excitement and fear born of excitement , nothing in her experience to compare with what was happening . She was a creature of habits , rigorous and ancient habits , and she had no way to know how she 'd respond out there . No habit had prepared her for this moment . <p> " Here , " said her gracious host . " Come in here . " <p> No excuse occurred to her . They were in a deep closet full of lifesuits  --  this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let Orleans select one and dismantle it with his growling joints . " It opens and closes , unlike mine , " he explained . " It does n't have all the redundant systems either . Otherwise , it 's the same . " <p> On went the legs , the torso and arms and helmet ; she banged the helmet against the low ceiling , then struck the wall with her first step . <p> " Follow me , " Orleans advised , " and keep it slow . " <p> Wise words . They entered some sort of tunnel that zigzagged toward space , ancient stairs fashioned for a nearly human gait . Each bend had an invisible field that held back the ship 's thinning atmosphere . They began speaking by radio , voices close , and she noticed how she could feel through the suit , its pseudoneurons interfacing with her own . Here gravity was stronger than earth-standard , yet despite her added bulk she moved with ease , limbs humming , her helmet striking the ceiling as she climbed . Thump , and thump . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sound close and intimate . " You 're doing fine , Quee Lee . Relax . " <p> Hearing her name gave her a dilute courage . <p> " Remember , " he said , " your servomotors are potent . Lifesuits make motions large . Do n't overcontrol , and do n't act cocky . " <p> She wanted to succeed . More than anything in recent memory , she wanted everything as close to perfect as possible . <p> " Concentrate , " he said . <p> Then he told her , " That 's better , yes . " <p> They came to a final turn , then a hatch , Orleans pausing and turning , his syrupy mouth making a preposterous smile . " Here we are . We 'll go outside for just a little while , okay ? " A pause , then he added , " When you go home , tell your husband what you 've done . Amaze him ! " <p> " I will , " she whispered . <p> And he opened the hatch with an arm  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and a bright colored glow washed over them . " Beautiful , " the Remora observed . " Is n't it beautiful , Quee Lee ? " <p> Perri did n't return home for several more weeks , and when he arrived - " I was rafting Cloud Canyon , love and did n't get your messages ! "  --  Quee Lee realized that she was n't going to tell him about her adventure . Nor about the money . She 'd wait for a better time , a weak moment , when Perri 's guard was down . " What 's so important , love ? You sounded urgent . " She told him it was nothing , that she 'd missed him and been worried . How was the rafting ? Who went with him ? Perri told her , " Tweewits . Big hulking baboons , in essence . " He smiled until she smiled too . He looked thin and tired ; but that night , with minimal prompting , he found the energy to make love to her twice . And the second time was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so willingly live without sex for long periods . It could be the most amazing pleasure . <p> Perri slept , dreaming of artificial rivers roaring through artificial canyons ; and Quee Lee sat up in bed , in the dark , whispering for her apartment to show her the view above Port Beta . She had it projected into her ceiling , twenty meters overhead , the shimmering aurora changing colors as force fields wrestled with every kind of spaceborn hazard . <p> " What do you think , Quee Lee ? " <p> Orleans had asked the question , and she answered it again , in a soft awed voice . " Lovely . " She shut her eyes , remembering how the hull itself had stretched off into the distance , flat and gray , bland yet somehow serene . " It is lovely . " <p> " And even better up front , on the prow , " her companion had maintained . " The fields there are thicker , stronger . And the big lasers keep hitting the comets tens of millions of kilometers from us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a little laugh , telling her , " You can almost feel the ship moving when you look up from the prow . Honest . " <p> She had shivered inside her lifesuit , more out of pleasure than fear . Few passengers ever came out on the hull . They were breaking rules , no doubt . Even inside the taxi ships , you were protected by a hull . But not up there . Up there she 'd felt exposed , practically naked . And maybe Orleans had measured her mood , watching her face with the flickering pulses , finally asking her , " Do you know the story of the first Remora ? " <p> Did she ? She was n't certain . <p> He told it , his voice smooth and quiet . " Her name was Wune , " he began . " On Earth , it 's rumored , she was a criminal , a registered habitual criminal . Signing on as a crew mate helped her escape a stint of psychological realignment  --  " <p> " What crimes ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " Bad ones , and that 's too much said . The point is that Wune came here without rank , glad for the opportunity , and like any good mate , she took her turns out on the hull . " Quee Lee had nodded , staring off at the far horizon . <p> " She was pretty , like you . Between shifts , she did typical typicals . She explored the ship and had affairs of the heart and grieved the affairs that went badly . Like you , Quee Lee , she was smart . And after just a few centuries on board , Wune could see the trends . She saw how the captains were avoiding their shifts on the hull . And how certain people , guilty of small offenses , were pushed into double-shifts in their stead . All so that our captains did n't have to accept the tiniest , fairest risks . " <p> Status . Rank . Privilege . She could understand these things , probably too well . <p> " Wune rebelled , " Orleans had said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system , she conquered by embracing it . By transforming what she embraced . " A soft laugh . " This lifesuit of mine ? She built its prototype with its semi-forever seals and the hyperefficient recyke systems . She made a suit that she 'd never have to leave , then she began to live on the hull , in the open , sometimes alone for years at a time . " <p> " Alone ? " <p> " A prophet 's contemplative life . " A fond glance at the smooth gray terrain . " She stopped having her body purged of cancers and other damage . She let her face  --  her beautiful face  --  become speckled with dead tissues . Then she taught herself to manage her mutations , with discipline and strength . Eventually she picked a few friends without status , teaching them her tricks and explaining the peace and purpose she had found while living up here , contemplating the universe without obstructions . " <p> Without obstructions indeed ! <p> " A few hundred became the First Generation . Attrition convinced our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbered in the thousands . By the Third , we were officially responsible for the ship 's exterior and the deadliest pans of its engines . We had achieved a quiet conquest of a world-sized realm , and today we number in the low millions ! " <p> She remembered sighing , asking , " What happened to Wune ? " <p> " An heroic death , " he had replied . " A comet swarm was approaching . <p> A repair team was caught on the prow , their shuttle dead and useless  --  " <p> " Why were they there if a swann was coming ? " <p> " Patching a crater , of course . Remember . The prow can withstand almost any likely blow , but if comets were to strike on top of one another , unlikely as that sounds  --  " <p> " A disaster , " she muttered . <p> " For the passengers below , yes . " A strange slow smile . " Wune died trying to bring them a fresh shuttle . She was vaporized under a chunk of ice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry . " Whispered . <p> " Wune was my great-great-grandmother , " the man had added . " And no , she did n't name us Remoras . That originally was an insult , some captain responsible . Remoras are ugly fish that cling to sharks . Not a pleasing image , but Wune embraced the word . To us it means spiritual fulfillment , independence and a powerful sense of self . Do you know what I am , Quee Lee ? I 'm a god inside this suit of mine . I role in ways you ca n't appreciate . You ca n't imagine how it is , having utter control over my body , my self . . . ! " <p> She had stared at him , unable to speak . <p> A shiny hand had lifted , thick fingers against his faceplate . " My eyes ? <p> You 're fascinated by my eyes , are n't you ? " <p> A tiny nod . " Yes . " <p> " Do you know how I sculpted them ? " <p> " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you close your hand ? " <p> She had made a fist , as if to show him how . <p> " But which neurons fire ? Which muscles contract ? " A mild , patient laugh , then he had added , " How can you manage something that you ca n't describe in full ? " <p> She had said , " It 's habit , I guess . . . . " <p> " Exactly ! " A larger laugh . " I have habits too . For instance , I can willfully spread mutations using metastasized cells . I personally have thousands of years of practice , plus all those useful mechanisms that I inherited from Wune and the others . It 's as natural as your making the fist . " <p> " But my hand does n't change its real shape , " she had countered . <p> " Transformation is my habit , and it 's why my life is so much richer than yours . " He had given her a wink just then , saying , " I ca n't count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quee Lee looked up at her bedroom ceiling now , at a curtain of blue glows dissolving into pink . In her mind , she replayed the moment . <p> " You think Remoras are vile , ugly monsters , " Orleans had said . " Now do n't deny it . I wo n't let you deny it . " <p> She had n't made a sound . <p> " When you saw me standing at your door ? When you saw that a Remora had come to your home ? All of that ordinary blood of yours drained out of your face . You looked so terribly pale and weak , Quee Lee . Horrified ! " She could n't deny it . Not then or now . <p> " Which of us has the richest life , Quee Lee ? And be objective . Is it you or is it me ? " <p> She pulled her bedsheets over herself , shaking a little bit . <p> " You or me ? " <p> " Me , " she whispered , but in that word was doubt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling toward her with his face trying to waken . Quee Lee had a last glance at the projected sky , then had it quelched . Then Perri was grinning , blinking and reaching for her , asking : <p> " Ca n't you sleep , love ? " <p> " No , " she admitted . Then she said , " Come here , darling . " <p> " Well , well , " he laughed . " Are n't you in a mood ? " <p> Absolutely . A feverish mood , her mind leaping from subject to subject , without order , every thought intense and sudden , Perri on top of her and her old-fashioned eyes gazing up at the darkened ceiling , still seeing the powerful surges of changing colors that obscured the bright dusting of stars . <p> THEY TOOK a second honeymoon , Quee Lee 's treat . They traveled halfway around the ship , visiting a famous resort beside a small tropical sea ; and for several months , they enjoyed the scenery and beaches , bone-white sands dropping into azure waters where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different sky , the ship supplying stored images of nebulas and strange suns ; and they made love in the oddest places , in odd ways , strangers sometimes coming upon them and pausing to watch . <p> Yet she felt detached somehow , hovering overhead like an observer . Did Remoras have sex ? she wondered . And if so , how ? And how did they make their children ? One day , Perri strapped on a gill and swam alone to the reef , leaving Quee Lee free to do research . Remoran sex , if it could be called that , was managed with electrical stimulation through the suits themselves . Reproduction was something else , children conceived in vitro , samples of their parents ' genetics married and grown inside a hyperfiber envelope . The envelope was expanded as needed . Birth came with the first independent fusion plant . What an incredible way to live , she realized ; but then again , there were many human societies that seemed bizarre . Some refused immortality . Some had married computers or lived in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups . . . only she could n't learn much about the Remoran faith . Was their faith secret ? And if so , why had she been allowed a glimpse of their private world ? <p> Perri remained pleasant and attentive . <p> " I know this is work for you , " she told him , " and you 've been a delight , darling . Old women appreciate these attentions . " <p> " Oh , you 're not old ! " A wink and smile , and he pulled her close . " And it 's not work at all . Believe me ! " <p> They returned home soon afterward , and Quee Lee was disappointed with her apartment . It was just as she remembered it , and the sameness was depressing . Even the garden room failed to brighten her mood . . . and she found herself wondering if she 'd ever lived anywhere but here , the stone walls cold and closing in on her . <p> Perri asked , " What 's the matter , love ? " <p> She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I forgot to tell you something , " she began . " A friend of yours visited . . . oh , it was almost a year ago . " <p> The roguish charm surfaced , reliable and nonplussed . " Which friend ? " " Orleans . " <p> Sind Perri did n't respond at first , hearing the name and not allowing his expression to change . He stood motionless , not quite looking at her ; and Quee Lee noticed a weakness in the mouth and something glassy about the smiling eyes . She felt uneasy , almost asking him what was wrong . Then Perri said , " What did Orleans want ? " His voice was too soft , almost a whisper . A sideways glance , and he muttered , " Orleans came here ? " He could n't quite believe what she was saying . . . . <p> " You owed him some money , " she replied . Perri did n't speak , did n't seem to hear anything . " Perri ? " <p> He swallowed and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " But . . . but what happened . . . ? " She told him and she did n't . She mentioned the old seals and some other salient details , then in the middle of her explanation , all at once , something obvious and awful occurred to her . What if there had n't been a debt ? She gasped , asking . " You did owe him the money , did n't you ? " " How much did you say it was ? " She told him again . <p> He nodded . He swallowed and straightened his back , then managed to say , " I 'll pay you back . . . as soon as possible . . . . " <p> " Is there any hurry ? " She took his hand , telling him , " I have n't made noise until now , have I ? " Do n't worry . " A pause . " I just wonder how you could owe him so much ? " <p> Perri shook his head . " I 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll raise the rest . Soon as I can , I promise . " <p> She said , " Fine . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " he muttered . <p> " How do you know a Remora ? " <p> He seemed momentarily confused by the question . Then he managed to say , " You know me . A taste for the exotic , and all that . " <p> " You lost the money gambling ? Is that what happened ? " <p> " I 'd nearly forgotten , it was so long ago . " He summoned a smile and some of the old charm . " You should know , darling . . . those Remoras are n't anything like you and me . Be very careful with them , please . " <p> She did n't mention her jaunt on the hull . Everything was old news anyway , and why had she brought it up in the first place ? Perri kept promising to pay her back . He announced he was leaving tomorrow , needing to find some nameless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fifteen hundred credits . " A weak down payment , I know . " Quee Lee thought of reassuring him  --  he seemed painfully nervous  --  but instead she simply told him , " Have a good trip , and come home soon . " <p> He was a darling man when vulnerable . " Soon , " he promised , walking out the front door . And an hour later , Quee Lee left too , telling herself that she was going to the hull again to confront her husband 's old friend . What was this mysterious debt ? Why did it bother him so much ? But somewhere during the long tube-car ride , before she reached Port Beta , she realized that a confrontation would just further embarrass Perri , and what cause would that serve ? <p> " What now ? " she whispered to herself . <p> Another walk on the hull , of course . If Orleans would allow it . If he had the time , she hoped , and the inclination . <p> His face had turned blue , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairs that shone in the light , something about them distinctly amused . " I guess we could go for a stroll , " said the cool voice . They were standing in the same locker room , or one just like it ; Quee Lee was unsure about directions . " We could , " said Orleans , " but if you want to bend the rules , why bend little ones ? Why not pick the hefty ones ? " <p> She watched the mouth smile down at her , two little tusks showing in its corners . " What do you mean ? " she asked . <p> " Of course it 'll take time , " he warned . " A few months , maybe a few years . . . . " <p> She had centuries , if she wanted . <p> " I know you , " said Orleans . " You 've gotten curious about me , about us . " Orleans moved an arm , not so much as a hum coming from the refurbished joints . " We 'll make you an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow a lifesuit , set you inside it , then transform you partway in a hurry-up fashion . " <p> " You can ? How ? " <p> " Oh , aimed doses of radiation . Plus we 'll give you some useful mutations . I 'll wrap up some genes inside smart cancers , and they 'll migrate to the right spots and grow . . . . " <p> She was frightened and intrigued , her heart kicking harder . <p> " It wo n't happen overnight , of course . And it depends on how much you want done . " A pause . " And you should know that it 's not strictly legal . The captains have this attitude about putting passengers a little bit at risk . " <p> " How much risk is there ? " <p> Orleans said , " The transformation is easy enough , in principle . I 'll call up our records , make sure of the fine points . " A pause and a narrowing of the eyes . " We 'll keep you asleep throughout . Intravenous feedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one body , then waken with a new one . A better one , I 'd like to think . How much risk ? Almost none , believe me . " <p> She felt numb . Small and weak and numb . <p> " You wo n't be a true Remora . Your basic genetics wo n't be touched , I promise . But someone looking at you will think you 're genuine . " <p> For an instant , with utter clarity , Quee Lee saw herself alone on the great gray hull , walking the path of the first Remora . <p> " Are you interested ? " <p> " Maybe . I am . " <p> " You 'll need a lot of interest before we can start , " he warned . " We have expenses to consider , and I 'll be putting my crew at risk . If the captains find out , it 's a suspension without pay . " He paused , then said , " Are you listening to me ? " <p> " It 's going to cost money , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Quee Lee was braced for a larger sum , two hundred thousand credits still large but not unbearable . She would n't be able to take as many trips to fancy resorts , true . Yet how could a lazy , prosaic resort compare with what she was being offered ? <p> " You 've done this before ? " she asked . <p> He waited a moment , then said , " Not for a long time , no . " <p> She did n't ask what seemed quite obvious , thinking of Peru and secretly smiling to herself . <p> " Take time , " Orleans counseled . " Feel sure . " <p> But she had already decided . <p> " Quee Lee ? " <p> She looked at him , asking , " Can I have your eyes ? Can you wrap them up in a smart cancer for me ? " <p> " Certainly ! " A great fluid smile emerged , framed with tusks . " Pick and choose as you wish . Anything you wish . " <p> " The eyes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he declared , giving a little wink . <p> Arrangements had to be made , and what surprised her most  --  what she enjoyed more than the anticipation  --  was the subterfuge , taking money from her savings and leaving no destination , telling her apartment that she would be gone for an indeterminate time . At least a year , and perhaps much longer . Orleans had n't put a cap on her stay with them , and what if she liked the Remoran life ? Why not keep her possibilities open ? <p> " If Perri returns ? " asked the apartment . <p> He was to have free reign of the place , naturally . She thought she 'd made herself clear  --  <p> " No , miss , " the voice interrupted . " What do I tell him , if anything ? " <p> " Tell him . . . tell him that I 've gone exploring . " <p> " Exploring ? " <p> " Tell him it 's my turn for a change , " she declared ; and she left without as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same female Remora , the one who had taken Quee Lee to him twice now . Her comma-shaped eyes had n't changed , but the mouth was smaller and the gray teeth had turned black as obsidian . Quee Lee lay between them as they worked , their faces smiling but the voices tight and shrill . Not for the first time , she realized she was n't hearing their real voices . The suits themselves were translating their wet mutterings , which is why throats and mouths could change so much without having any audible effect . <p> " Are you comfortable ? " asked the woman . But before Quee Lee could reply , she asked , " Any last questions ? " <p> Quee Lee was encased in the lifesuit , a sudden panic taking hold of her . <p> " When I go home . . . when I 'm done . . . how fast can I . . . ? " <p> " Can you ? " <p> " Return to my normal self . " <p> " Cure the damage , you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one unreadable state to another . " I do n't think there 's a firm answer , dear . Do you have an autodoc in your apartment ? Good . Let it excise the bad and help you grow your own organs over again . As if you 'd suffered a bad accident . . . . " A brief pause . " It should take what , Orleans ? Six months to be cured ? " <p> The man said nothing busy with certain controls inside her suit 's helmet . Quee Lee could just see his face above and behind her . <p> " Six months and you can walk in public again . " <p> " I do n't mean it that way , " Quee Lee countered , swallowed now . A pressure was building against her chest , panic becoming terror . She wanted nothing now but to be home again . <p> " Listen , " said Orleans , then he said nothing . <p> Finally Quee Lee whispered , " What ? " <p> He knelt beside her , saying " You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence was missing . Perhaps he had n't believed she would go through with this adventure . Perhaps the offer had been some kind of bluff , something no sane person would find appealing and now he 'd invent some excuse to stop everything  --  <p>  --  but he said , " Seals tight and ready . " <p> " Tight and ready , " echoed the woman . <p> Smiles appeared on both faces , though neither inspired confidence . Then Orleans was explaining : " There 's only a slight , slight chance that you wo n't return to normal . If you should get hit by too much radiation , precipitating too many novel mutations . . . well , the strangeness can get buried too deeply . <p> A thousand autodocs could n't root it all out of you . " <p> " Vestigial organs , " the woman added . " Odd blemishes and the like . " <p> " It wo n't happen , " said Orleans . <p> " It wo n't , " Quee Lee agreed . <p> A feeding nipple appeared before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleans told her . <p> She swallowed some sort of chemical broth , and the woman was saying , " No , it would take ten or fifteen centuries to make lasting marks . Unless  --  " <p> Orleans said something , snapping at her . <p> She laughed with a bitter sound , saying , " Oh , she 's asleep . . . ! " <p> And Quee Lee was asleep . She found herself in a dreamless , timeless void , her body being pricked with needles  --  little white pains marking every smart cancer  --  and it was as if nothing else existed in the universe but Quee Lee , floating in that perfect blackness while she was remade . <p> " How long ? " <p> " Not so long . Seven months , almost . " <p> Seven months . Quee Lee tried to blink and could n't , could n't shut the lids of her eyes . Then she tried touching her face , lifting a heavy hand and setting the palm on her faceplate , finally remembering her suit . " Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow . " Am I done now ? " <p> " You 're never done , " Orleans laughed . " Have n't you been paying attention ? " <p> She saw a figure , blurred but familiar . <p> " How do you feel , Quee Lee ? " <p> Strange . Through and through , she felt very strange . <p> " That 's normal enough , " the voice offered . " Another couple months , and you 'll be perfect . Have patience . " <p> She was a patient person , she remembered . And now her eyes seemed to shut of their own volition , her mind sleeping again . But this time she dreamed , her and Perri and Orleans all at the beach together . She saw them sunning on the bone-white sand , and she even felt the heat of the false sun , felt it baking hot down to her rebuilt bones . <p> She woke , muttering , " Orleans ? Orleans ? " <p> " Here I am . " <p> Her vision was improved now . She found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word and her suit managing an accurate translation . <p> " How do I look ? " she asked . <p> Orleans smiled and said , " Lovely . " <p> His face was blue-black , perhaps . When she sat up , looking at the plain gray locker room , she realized how the colors had shifted . Her new eyes perceived the world differently , sensitive to the same spectrum but in novel <p> ways . She slowly climbed to her feet , then asked , " How long ? " <p> " Nine months , fourteen days . " <p> No , she was n't finished . But the transformation had reached a stable point , she sensed , and it was wonderful to be mobile again . She managed a few tentative steps . She made clumsy fists with her too-thick hands . Lifting the fists , she gazed at them , wondering how they would look beneath the hyperfiber . <p> " Want to see yourself ? " Orleans asked . <p> Now ? Was she ready ? <p> Her friend smiled , tusks glinting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror , and she bent to put her face close enough . . . finding a remade face staring up at her , a sloppy mouth full of mirror-colored teeth and a pair of hairy pits for eyes . She managed a deep breath and shivered . Her skin was lovely , golden or at least appearing golden to her . It was covered with hard white lumps , and her nose was a slender beak . She wished she could touch herself , hands stroking her faceplate . Only Remoras could never touch their own flesh . . . . <p> " If you feel strong enough , " he offered , " you can go with me . My crew and I are going on a patching mission , out to the prow . " <p> " When ? " <p> " Now , actually . " He lowered the mirror . " The others are waiting in the shuttle . Stay here for a couple more days , or come now . " <p> " Now , " she whispered . <p> " Good . " He nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're curious what sort of person becomes a Remora . " <p> A person who does n't want to be locked up in a bland gray room , she thought to herself , smiling now with her mirrored teeth . <p> They had all kinds of faces , all unique , myriad eyes and twisting mouths and flesh of every color . She counted fifteen Remoras , plus Orleans , and Quee Lee worked to learn names and get to know her new friends . The shuttle ride was like a party , a strange informal party , and she had never known happier people , listening to Remora jokes and how they teased one another , and how they sometimes teased her . In friendly ways , of course . They asked about her apartment  --  how big , how fancy , how much  --  and about her long life . Was it as boring as it sounded ? Quee Lee laughed at herself while she nodded , saying , " No , nothing changes very much . The centuries have their way of running together , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a contorted blue face  --  asked the others , " Why do people pay fortunes to ride the ship , then do everything possible to hide deep inside it ? Why do n't they ever step outside and have a little look at where we 're going ? " <p> The cabin erupted in laughter , the observation an obvious favorite . <p> " Immortals are cowards , " said the woman beside Quee Lee . <p> " Fools , " said a second woman , the one with comma-shaped eyes . " Most of them , at least . " <p> Quee Lee felt uneasy , but just temporarily . She turned and looked through a filthy window , the smooth changeless landscape below and the glowing sky as she remembered it . The view soothed her . Eventually she shut her eyes and slept , waking when Orleans shouted something about being close to their destination . " Decelerating now ! " he called from the cockpit . <p> They were slowing . Dropping . Looking at her friends , she saw a variety of smiles meant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone starting to pray . " No comets today , " they begged . " And plenty tomorrow , because we want overtime . " <p> The shuttle slowed to nothing , then settled . <p> Orleans strode back to Quee Lee , his mood suddenly serious . " Stay close , " he warned , " but do n't get in our way , either . " <p> The hyperfiber was thickest here , on the prow , better than ten kilometers deep , and its surface had been browned by the ceaseless radiations . A soft dry dust clung to the lifesuits , and everything was lit up by the aurora and flashes of laser light . Quee Lee followed the others , listening to their chatter . She ate a little meal of Remoran soup  --  her first conscious meal  --  feeling the soup moving down her throat , trying to map her new architecture . Her stomach seemed the same , but did she have two hearts ? It seemed that the beats were wrong . Two hearts nestled side by side . She found Orleans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my suit , just once . Just for a minute . " She told him , " I keep wondering how all of me looks . " <p> Orleans glanced at her , then away . He said , " No . " <p> " No ? " <p> " Remoras do n't remove their suits . Ever . " <p> There was anger in the voice and a deep chilling silence from the others . Quee Lee looked about , then swallowed . " I 'm not a Remora , " she finally said . " I do n't understand . . . . " <p> Silence persisted , quick looks exchanged . <p> " I 'm going to climb out of this . . . eventually . . . ! " <p> " But do n't say it now , " Orleans warned . A softer , more tempered voice informed her , " We have taboos . Maybe we seem too rough to have them  --  " <p> " No , " she muttered . <p> "  --  yet we do . These lifesuits are as much a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being a Remora , a true Remora , is a sacred pledge that you take for your entire life . " <p> The comma-eyed woman approached , saying , " It 's an insult to remove your suit . A sacrilege . " <p> " Contemptible , " said someone else . " Or worse . " <p> Then Orleans , perhaps guessing Quee Lee 's thoughts , made a show of touching her , and she felt the hand through her suit . " Not that you 're anything but our guest , of course . Of course . " He paused , then said , " We have our beliefs , that 's all . " <p> " Ideals , " said the woman . <p> " And contempt for those we do n't like . Do you understand ? " <p> She could n't , but she made understanding sounds just the same . Obviously she had found a sore spot . <p> Then came a new silence , and she found herself marching through the dust , wishing someone would make angry sounds again . Silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she vowed , she would be careful about everything she said . Every word . <p> THE CRATER was vast and rough and only partway patched . Previous crew had brought giant tanks and the machinery used to make the patch . It was something of an artform , pouring the fresh liquid hyperfiber and carefully curing it . Each shift added another hundred meters to the smooth crater floor . Orleans stood with Quee Lee at the top , explaining the job . This would be a double shift , and she was free to watch . " But not too closely , " he warned her again , the tone vaguely parental . " Stay out of our way . " <p> She promised . For that first half-day , she was happy to sit on the crater 's lip , on a ridge of tortured and useless hyperfiber , imagining the comet that must have made this mess . Not large , she knew . A large one would have blasted a crater too big to see at a glance , and forty crews would be laboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . It must have slipped past the lasers , part of a swarm . She watched the red beams cutting across the sky , their heat producing new colors in the aurora . Her new eyes saw amazing details . Shock waves as violet phosphorescence ; swirls of orange and crimson and snowy white . A beautiful deadly sky , was n't it ? Suddenly the lasers fired faster , a spiderweb of beams overhead , and she realized that a swarm was ahead of the ship , pinpointed by the navigators somewhere below them . . . tens of millions of kilometers ahead , mud and ice and rock closing fast . . . ! <p> The lasers fired even faster , and she bowed her head . <p> There was an impact , at least one . She saw the flash and felt a faint rumble dampened by the hull , a portion of those energies absorbed and converted into useful power . Impacts were fuel , of a sort . And the residual gases would be concentrated and pumped inside , helping to replace the inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trek . <p> The ship was an organism feeding on the galaxy . <p> It was a familiar image , almost cliche , yet suddenly it seemed quite fresh . Even profound . Quee Lee laughed to herself , looking out over the browning plain while turning her attentions inward . She was aware of her breathing and the bump-bumping of wrong hearts , and she sensed changes with every little motion . Her body had an odd indecipherable quality . She could feel every fiber in her muscles , every twitch and every stillness . She had never been so alive , so self-aware , and she found herself laughing with a giddy amazement . <p> If she was a true Remora , she thought , then she would be a world unto herself . A world like the ship , only smaller , its organic parts enclosed in armor and forever in flux . Like the passengers below , the cells of her body were changing . She thought she could nearly feel herself evolving . . . and how did Orleans control it ? It would be astonishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . gaining eyes unique to herself , never having existed before and never to exist again . . . ! <p> What if she stayed with these people ? <p> The possibility suddenly occurred to her , taking her by surprise . <p> What if she took whatever pledge was necessary , embracing all of their taboos and proving that she belonged with them ? Did such things happen ? Did adventurous passengers try converting  --  ? <p> The sky turned red , lasers firing and every red line aimed at a point directly overhead . The silent barrage was focused on some substantial chunk of ice and grit , vaporizing its surface and cracking its heart . Then the beams separated , assaulting the bigger pieces and then the smaller ones . It was an enormous drama , her exhilaration married to terror . . . her watching the aurora brightening as force fields killed the momentum of the surviving grit and atomic dust . The sky was a vivid orange , and sudden tiny impacts kicked up the dusts around her . Something struck her leg , a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she wondered if she was dead , then how badly she was wounded . Then she blinked and saw the little crater etched above her knee . A blemish , if that . And suddenly the meteor shower was finished . <p> Quee Lee rose to her feet , shaking with nervous energy . <p> She began picking her way down the crater slope . Orleans ' commands were forgotten ; she needed to speak to him . She had insights and compliments to share , nearly tripping with her excitement , finally reaching the worksite and gasping , her air stale from her exertions . She could taste herself in her breaths , the flavor unfamiliar , thick and a little sweet . <p> " Orleans ! " she cried out . <p> " You 're not supposed to be here , " groused one woman . <p> The comma-eyed woman said , " Stay right there . Orleans is coming , and do n't move ! " <p> A lake of fresh hyperfiber was cooling and curing as she stood beside it . A thin skin had formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quee Lee could see the sky reflected in it , leaning forward and knowing she should n't . She risked falling in order to see herself once again . The nearby Remoras watched her , saying nothing . They smiled as she grabbed a lump of old hyperfiber , positioning herself , and the lasers flashed again , making everything bright as day . <p> She did n't see her face . <p> Or rather , she did . But it was n't the face she expected , the face from Orleans ' convenient mirror . Here was the old Quee Lee , mouth ajar , those pretty and ordinary eyes opened wide in amazement . <p> She gasped , knowing everything . A near-fortune paid , and nothing in return . Nothing here had been real . This was an enormous and cruel sick joke ; and now the Remoras were laughing , hands on their untouchable bellies and their awful faces contorted , ready to rip apart from the sheer brutal joy of the moment . . . ! <p> YOUR MIRROR was n't a mirror , was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She kept asking questions , not waiting for a response . " And you drugged me , did n't you ? That 's why everything still looks and feels wrong . " <p> Orleans said , " Exactly . Yes . " <p> Quee Lee remained inside her lifesuit , just the two of them flying back to Port Beta . He would see her on her way home . The rest of the crew was working , and Orleans would return and finish his shift . After her discovery , everyone agreed there was no point in keeping her on the prow . <p> " You owe me money , " she managed . <p> Orleans ' face remained blue-black . His tusks framed a calm icy smile . " Money ? Whose money ? " <p> " I paid you for a service , and you never met the terms . " <p> " I do n't know about any money , " he laughed . <p> " I 'll report you , " she snapped , trying to use all of her venom . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrass yourself further . " He was confident , even cocky . " Our transaction would be labeled illegal , not to mention disgusting . The captains will be thoroughly disgusted , believe me . " Another laugh . " Besides , what can anyone prove ? You gave someone your money , but nobody will trace it to any of us . Believe me . " <p> She had never felt more ashamed , crossing her arms and trying to wish herself home again . <p> " The drug will wear off soon , " he promised . " You 'll feel like yourself again . Do n't worry . " <p> Softly , in a breathless little voice , she asked , " How long have I been gone ? " <p> Silence . <p> " It has n't been months , has it ? " <p> " More like three days . " A nod inside the helmet . " The same drug distorts your sense of time , if you get enough of it . " <p> She felt ill to her stomach . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> She was shaking and holding herself . <p> The Remora glanced at her for a long moment , something resembling remorse in his expression . Or was she misreading the signs ? <p> " You are n't spiritual people , " she snapped . It was the best insult she could manage , and she spoke with certainty . " You 're crude , disgusting monsters . You could n't live below if you had the chance , and this is where you belong . " <p> Orleans said nothing , merely watching her . <p> Finally he looked ahead , gazing at the endless gray landscape . " We try to follow our founder 's path . We try to be spiritual . " A shrug . " Some of us do better than others , of course . We 're only human . " <p> She whispered , " Why ? " <p> Again he looked at her , asking , " Why what ? " <p> " Why have you done this to me ? " <p> Orleans seemed to breathe and hold the breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " you have n't been paying attention , have you ? " <p> What did he mean ? <p> He grasped her helmet , pulling her face up next to his face . She saw nothing but the eyes , each black hair moving and nameless fluids circulating through them , and she heard the voice saying . " This has never , never been about you , Quee Lee . Not you . Not for one instant . " <p> And she understood  --  perhaps she had always known  --  struck mute and her skin going cold , and finally , after everything , she found herself starting to weep . <p> Perri was already home , by chance . <p> " I was worried about you , " he confessed , sitting in the garden room with honest relief on his face . " The apartment said you were going to be gone for a year or more . I was scared for you . " <p> " Well , " she said , " I 'm back . " <p> Her husband tried not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask certain questions . She could see him holding the questions inside himself . She watched him decide to try the old charm , smiling now and saying , " So you went exploring ? " <p> " Not really . " <p> " Where ? " <p> " Cloud Canyon , " she lied . She had practiced the lie all the way from Port Beta , yet it sounded false now . She was halfway startled when her husband said : <p> " Did you go into it ? " <p> " Partway , then I decided not to risk it . I rented a boat , but I could n't make myself step on board . " <p> Perri grinned happily , unable to hide his relief . A deep breath was exhaled , then he said , " By the way , I 've raised almost eight thousand credits already . I 've already put them in your account . " <p> " Fine . " <p> " I 'll find the rest too . " <p> " It can wait , " she offered . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling ? " <p> " I 'm tired , " she allowed . <p> " You look tired . " <p> " Let 's go to bed , shall we ? " <p> Perri was compliant , making love to her and falling into a deep sleep , as exhausted as Quee Lee . But she insisted on staying awake , sliding into her private bathroom and giving her autodoc a drop of Perri 's seed . " I want to know if there 's anything odd , " she told it . <p> " Yes , miss . " <p> " And scan him , will you ? Without waking him . " <p> The machine set to work . Almost instantly , Quee Lee was being shown lists of abnormal genes and vestigial organs . She did n't bother to read them . She closed her eyes , remembering what little Orleans had told her after he had admitted that she was n't anything more than an incidental bystander . " Perri was born Remors , and he left us . A long time ago , by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Leaving the fold ? " she had said . <p> " Every so often , one of us visits his home while he 's gone . We slip a little dust into our joints , making them grind , and we do a pity-play to whomever we find . " <p> Her husband had lied to her from the first , about everything . <p> " Sometimes we 'll trick her into giving even more money , " he had boasted . " Just like we 've done with you . " <p> And she had asked , " Why ? " <p> " Why do you think ? " he had responded . <p> Vengeance , of a sort . Of course . <p> " Eventually , " Orleans had declared , " he 'll have to come back to us . We just do n't want it to happen too soon , you know ? It 's too much fun as it is . " <p> Now she opened her eyes , gazing at the lists of abnormalities . It had to be work for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was n't merely someone who had lived on the hull for a few years , no . He was a full-blooded Remora who had done the unthinkable , removing his suit and living below , safe from the mortal dangers of the universe . Quee Lee was the latest of his ignorant lovers , and she knew precisely why he had selected her . More than money , she had offered him a useful naivete and a sheltered ignorance . . . and was n't she well within her rights to confront him , confront him and demand that he leave at once . . . ? <p> " Erase the lists , " she said . <p> " Yes , miss . " <p> She told her apartment , " Project the view from the prow , if you will . Put it on my bedroom ceiling , please . " <p> " Of course , miss , " it replied . <p> She stepped out of the bathroom , lasers and exploding comets overhead . She fully expected to do what Orleans anticipated , putting her mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , on Perri 's side , waiting for him to wake on his own . He would feel her gaze and open his eyes , seeing her framed by a Remoran sky . . . . <p> . . . and she hesitated , taking a breath and holding it , glancing upwards , remembering that moment on the crater 's lip when she had felt a union with her body . A perfection ; an intoxicating sense of self . It was induced by drugs and ignorance , yet still it had seemed true . It was a perception worth any cost , she realized ; and she imagined Perri 's future , hounded by the Remoras , losing every human friend , left with no choice but the hull and his left-behind life . . . . <p> She looked at him , the peaceful face stirring . <p> Compassion . Pity . Not love , but there was something not far from love making her feel for the fallen Remora . <p> " What if . . . ? " she whispered , beginning to smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him enjoying some lazy dream that in an instant he would surely forget . <p> <p> By Robert Reed <p> Our final story in this issue inspired Barclay Shaw 's striking cover . " The Remoras " is a hard sf story only Robert Reed could write . Bob most recently appeared in our February , 1994 , issue , and his short story , " Coffins , " will be reprinted in The Best of Fantasy and Science Fiction this fall . <p> " Those quiet streets disturbed me more than the media scenes of fire and death had done . Perhaps it was because evidence of such tragedy lurked beneath a skin of normalcy . . . . ' California Dreamer ' grew from that . . . . . I began to wonder just how deep and far reaching the effects of human cataclysm might be . " <p>
