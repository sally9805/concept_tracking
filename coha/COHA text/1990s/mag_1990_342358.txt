If at first you do n't succeed , then cheat like crazy . That seems to be the philosophy behind the making of an ad for Volvos . Print and TV commercials featured Bear Foot , a six-ton truck that drives over a row of cars , flattening them all  --  except the Volvo . But last week the Swedish automaker withdrew the ad , admitting that the sturdy Volvo had a little help : steel posts welded to the chassis . When Volvo filmed the commercial last June in Austin , Bear Foot initially crushed everything in its path , including a Volvo . In view of 400 hired spectators , the production crew beefed up the dwindling supply of Volvos with the steel posts . Angry spectators prompted a state probe . In a settlement , Volvo agreed to pay Texas $316,000 in investigative costs and to run apologetic newspaper ads . Last Friday the U.S. Hot Rod Association staged a rematch . The Volvos held up well at first , but after a few passes , the truck won .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
