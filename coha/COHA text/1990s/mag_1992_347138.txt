Woman walks into a bar . The regulars instantly size her up : " Uptown , East Side , college educated . Probably reuses her grocery bags . Charter subscriber to Working Woman magazine . Saw The Big Chill three times . Plays Trivial Pursuit on the weekends with friends . What 's she doing here on a Monday ? It 's Murphy Brown night . " <P> Man makes a lewd comment . Woman instantly sizes him up : " Is there a brain up there , or just one long episode of Studs ? " <P> SCENES FROM BOTH SIDES OF TV 's generational divide : the first , from Diane English 's much anticipated new CBS sitcom Love and War , is hip , sophisticated , full of knowing media references ( including one to English 's own show  --  and current cause celebre  --  Murphy Brown ) . The second , from a less heralded new NBC sitcom called Out All Night , is brassy and in-your-face ; its TV reference , appropriately , is to a salacious game show . Love and War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitcoms served up by the networks this fall . Out All Night gives a good idea of what TV thinks of the younger generation . <P> Thirtysomething , ABC 's trendsetting drama series , has been off the air for more than a year , but the show 's angst-ridden spirit will be all over the dial this fall . In Love and War , a roughhewn Manhattan journalist ( Jay Thomas ) falls for a prickly , recently divorced restaurateur ( Susan Dey ) . In Hearts Afire , two aides to a U.S. Senator ( John Ritter and Markie Post ) get together despite clashing political views . NBC 's Mad About You focuses on neurotic newlyweds living in Manhattan , while ABC 's Laurie Hill adds a five-year-old child to the trials of a busy two-career couple . <P> It 's no surprise that thirtysomething shows are growing in popularity . They reflect , to a large degree , the experiences and life-styles of the people who create them . They attract the audience demographics that advertisers crave . They usually get applause from the critics  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to a medium dominated by escapist drivel . <P> The escapist drivel , meanwhile , is going after a younger crowd . TV 's hottest new genre is the twentysomething ensemble show . Melrose Place ( a spinoff of Beverly Hills 90210 ) , The Heights ( about a group of blue-collar New Jersey youths trying to launch a rock band ) and 2000 Malibu Road , a soap opera set in a California beach house , all drew strong ratings this summer . Coming this fall are NBC 's The Round Table ( young professionals in Washington ) , Fox 's Class of ' 96 ( students at a small Northeastern college ) and a slew of youth- oriented sitcoms . <P> A generation gap could hardly be more clearly defined . TV 's under-30s are , for the most part , shallow , fun loving , upbeat . They tend to live in communal groups and spend a lot of time in the sun . They are still young enough to be entranced with the idea of being on their own . One of the two bachelors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in Out All Night raves about their new apartment : " It 's what we 've always talked about . A place of our own , with no parents , no dorm directors  --  just freedom ! "
