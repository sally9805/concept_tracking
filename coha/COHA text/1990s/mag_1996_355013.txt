Trading has been brisk in Boris Yeltsin futures at the Russian stock market in downtown Moscow . Every day at 4:36 p.m. , youthful brokers with code names like " Father , " " Moon " and " Winter " buy and sell contracts pegged to whatever percentage of the vote they believe the Russian President will receive on election day . Since item Ye-1606-V began trading April 22 , Yeltsin 's projected total , registered in flashing orange lights on a big digital board , has jumped 10 points , to around 28.50  --  about equal to the quote for the Communist candidate , Gennadi Zyuganov . These speculators may care more about making a profit than about who wins and what it would mean for Russian democracy , but they at least have some stake in the outcome . Not all their countrymen feel that way . <P> After more than 10 years of political turmoil , during which Russians have gone to the polls five times in free parliamentary and presidential votes and three times in national referendums , democratic habits of thought and behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to view elections as onerous rituals that are likely to bring new troubles upon them . Tens of millions will probably cast their ballots with the hope of electing a strong leader who might limit or revoke the right to vote itself . They would consider it a small price to pay to end the chaos they believe has resulted from the country 's latest experiment with democracy . <P> Demokratiya , konstitutsiya , parlament and Prezident are all foreign additions to the Russian vocabulary . And although Russians can boast of ancient proto-democratic institutions like the village mir or the veche of Novgorod , where consensus decisions were reached at a kind of town meeting , centralized rule by an all-powerful executive  --  whether Czar or Communist Party General Secretary  --  has been the political norm throughout Russian history . The country simply has no democratic culture . It experimented briefly with limited parliamentary democracy before the 1917 revolution . The present era of quasi-democratization was inaugurated by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989 with elections for a new Congress of the People 's Deputies . But these two periods offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions of government . <P> As Russians continually point out , America has been in the business of electing Presidents for more than 200 years , while Russians have had less than a decade to learn the trade . The excuse has also often been made that authoritarian rule is more suited to a nation as large as Russia , where a loosening of centralized controls could result in anarchy . Anyone who has ever witnessed reform-minded political groups engaged in endless debates about what kind of slogans to use on their campaign posters would certainly come away convinced of the truth of that argument .
