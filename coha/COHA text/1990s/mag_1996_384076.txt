// Every snowflake is different , but all airports are the same . Calgary too ... at first . All glass and chrome and right angles . Then we ride down an escalator , under a small flock of Canadian geese , stuffed birds flying at the ends of invisible wires . Their recorded honking makes us smile , background music to our chat with an absurdly cheerful Canadian customs agent . Welcome to Canada . We change money in the arrival hall at a Thomas Cook kiosk next to a dancing cougar  --  stuffed mammals surround us  --  and relish the sensation of getting many more dollars back than we 've tendered . Welcome to Canada . The calendar says it 's early March , but outside , the icy air says it 's still winter , each breath visible . We steer our rental car down a snow-packed highway through snow-drifted suburbs that look all too familiar , stop at a gas station to buy a road map and stare in disbelief at a big two-pull Italian espresso machine under the Esso sign . " Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey , rubbing his hands together to warm them up . Welcome to Canada . We leave Calgary , and a wall of mountains rises out of a winter haze , almost an ice fog , on the western horizon . The scale is so huge that our rental car seemingly creeps forward into the Rockies at a snail 's pace , even though we and everybody on the highway is doing well over 70 miles per hour . As we speed across Alberta 's wheat country , golden stubble and white drifts accent the Rockies . And these are only foothills ! Already the mountains are starting to look like the Alps . These Canadian Rockies are not the Rocky Mountains that Colorado skiers know . They 're bigger , much bigger . Somewhere up ahead , in this jumble of rock walls , snowy peaks , and glacier ice is a whole ski region , Banff/Lake Louise-three ski areas , a vibrant mountain town , a romantic lone chateau on the shores of a frozen lake . I want to see it all , ski it all , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds burn off the flanks of Mount Victoria , so close we feel we can lean out the window of our room in the Chateau Lake Louise and touch the raw ice cliffs of the Victoria glacier-a different scale , a different place he thick carpets of this fin de siecle grand hotel absob small talk in three or four languages . We share an elevator with a German couple . The skiing ? The snow ? " Fantastic , but you know , it is very , very cold here , especially for Europeans like us . " Photograph " Let 's see , is it close my mouth and open my eyes ? Or close my eyes and open my mmmffff ! @#7 " Opposite : The Banff Springs Hotel . Preceding page : Exploring Paradise Bowl at Lake Louise . // Not a problem . An hour later I 'm slicing through numbingly cold air on squeaky skis , with a frozen smile hidden under my neck gaiter . True , spring does come late to these northern Rockies but then , skiing is a winter sport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm skiing down a new mountain and I feel like a new skier . Something is terribly right here . The Lake Louise ski area , five minutes across the Bow River valley from the chateau and its lake-andglacier backdrop , is big , 4,000 acres big . The top half of the mountain climbs above timberline , way above , open and inviting on crisp sunstruck days like today . Did I say mountain ? There 's more than one . From the top of the front face-already two high-speed quads into the skywe look off the back side into an Alpine cirque ringed with snow and rock , a white-on-white stage set for a Wagnerian opera with skiers in the lead roles . Dizzy from the view , we slip easily onto the tilted planes of a sublime skiers ' playground-long , steady pitches of winter snow , the steep , white roof of a giant 's castle . It has n't snowed for 12 days , but on our first run , my wife , Linde , and I find enough left-over powder to figure-eight each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure-eight championships , up in Purple Bowl . Okay , so Purple Bowl is a 20-minute walk above the lift but , yes , it is inbounds and worth the walk . I find myself making short turns that leave an elevator-dropping-away tickle in my stomach . I hear the whisper of big-mountain wind and the inimitable highpitched whisper of bent skis bending even deeper , cutting into the slope , then cutting to silence as legs relax and skis float out from under me , drop out from under me again , and again , and again . The steady big-mountain , steep-slope rhythm of acceleration , deceleration , acceleration , deceleration-turns without end on slopes that do n't end . . . for quite a while . There are moguls too , in unlikely places , chutes and walls and gullies . Big and round and steep , bumps to play with , not do battle with . And always , on all sides , a merry-go-round of postcard peaks fights for my attention , an Alpine panorama that , like the skiing , just does n't quit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this week in the Canadian Rockies is going to be the high point of my ski season , that Banff/Lake Louise may be a perfect example of why a great ski trip is better than just another great day , no matter how good the conditions , at your local mountain . We plan on spending a few days here at Lake Louise before driving down the Bow Valley Parkway , 40 minutes of dark lodgepole pines and dizzying rocky peaks , to Banff and its two other ski areasSunshine Village and Mt . Norquay . But one could easly spend a whole week at Lake Louise with no danger of boredom or burn out . It gets better . And the better a skier you are , the better it gets . Today we 're skiing with Charlie Locke , the sixtyish owner of the Lake Louise ski area , a helluva guy . I meet Charlie in his tiny cluttered office looking out over the slopes , very uncorporate , no decorator has ever been turned loose in here . Relishing an excuse to get out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bibs , slips on a pair of 10-year-old Salomon rental boots , and grabs a racy-looking pair of red Volkl skis . " Traded the German Team for " em this year , " he allows as we slip through the maze toward the first quad . ( If you ever wait longer than 10 minutes in a lift line at Lake Louise 's base area , your ticket price will be refunded . ) Charlie skis well , the steeper it gets , the steadier he looks . Which is not surprising , considering he made his reputation as a climber and mountain guide in the Lake Louise area before he made his fortune in the Calgary boom and began collecting ski areas . ( His holding company , " Locke , Stock and Barrel , " owns three others besides Lake Louise . ) We ski hard and talk on the lifts . Riding the Paradise chair , swinging our skis back and forth above mouth-watering steep terrain , I ca n't resist a question : " Charlie , how can you manage to only charge 30 U.S. dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while all the large U.S. areas are up around $50 a ticket ? " His answer is disarming : " We 're making plenty of money . We do n't need any more . " I 'm speechless . On the next run we ski around the lip of a cornice into Soul Bowl , and down into a tight line through Pika Trees . Charlie does n't miss a beat , or a single turn through those dense trees . Bravo . There are a lot of bravos as I explore Lake Louise , but few trees . Mostly there are white treeless slopes , steeps , and long open ridges diagonaling down out of a cool northern sky . I find the temptation to leave the beaten path ever present , and irresistible . These big shapes , and an enlightened management style ( i.e. , very few closed areas ) encourages off-piste skiing . I did n't need much encouragement . Every few runs , I consciously drop off a different side of the mountain , changing my views and my range of skiing options totally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in my case , of simple novelty . And this far north the snow quality does n't seem to suffer much on sunblasted slopes . My private version of Lake Louise skiing is full of half-packed snow and around-thecorner excursions to virtually unskied lines only a few minutes away from popular pistes . Lake Louise gives you as much space as you want . Later in the week , on a foggy snowy morning , Linde and I traverse into Rock Garden off the Larch chair . Clouds muffle skiers ' voices behind us , bare branches of scattered larches provide all the relief we need , and we ski a snowy roller coaster of rocky shapes , threading our way down a giant white pinball machine in the clouds , characters in a surreal dream . Put simply , skiing at Louise is the opposite of dull . Lake Louise by night is quiet , romantic , soulful ; more national park than international reesort . The chateau plays its 19th-century rode to perfection , a self-contained cruiseshop of a hotel in the middle of a frozen sea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high ceilings , bars and shops , like any grand hotel ; and of course its own restaurants , from formal to fondue stube , with discreet Canadian service . A few days at Lake Louise expands our apres-ski horizons . The high-log rafters of Deer Lodge are vintage national-park Gothic and the wild-game platter memorable . One night we eat at the old restored train station , bravely sampling wine from British Columbia while freight trains rumble by in the dark . Another night we hit the jackpot at the Post Hotel . A hunting guide built the original lodge from logs he floated down the river . It was bought by an English lord after the war , and today is owned and run by a Swiss family that must have inherited generations of hotelkeeping magic . Dinner is a work of art : Arctic char fillets in phyllo pastry with Noilly Prat sauce , strips of caribou loin on chanterelle mushrooms . The gods are smiling , the fire is crackling , the chef is a genius . As we leave the Post Hotel , a cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post of the staircase , is winking at us . Back at the chateau , as we fall asleep under a down comforter , the full moon is painting Mount Victoria with its midnight milk and honey . We wake to a snow squall , minus-25 degrees centigradetime to say goodbye to Lake Louise and its chateau and head for Banff . Perfect timing because Banff 's own ski mountain , the littlest ski area of the lot , Mt . Norquay , is storm proof . The runs of Mt . Norquay are all sheltered by trees , protected from wind and weather . Visibility is always good . Like the fingers of a hand slapped up against steep summit cliffs ( with the fingers pointing up ) the runs of this strange little mountain are separated from each other by off-limits gullies-avalanche chutes really . So when you ski Mt . Norquay , only a few minutes from the town of Banff , you ride a lift , ski down , then cut across to the next pod of runs where you find another lift to go back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs seems to be that the blacks are allowed to bump up and the blues are groomed . But ultimately the challenge is more to plan your route from side to side , across the mountain and back , rather than up and down . That , and staying warm . Our secret weapon against the cold is a French Canadian dish , la poutine , french fries smothered in brown gravy and white cheese , that we find and devour in Norquay 's base cafeteria . Altogether a good place to ski on a stormy day . Not exactly the magnet that draws one up here from the States , but a kind of bad-weather ski-insurance policy for any Banff/Lake Louise ski trip . Actually , the town of Banff is interesting enough that you are not really under any pressure to ski on those stormy bleak days that , inevitably , try a skier 's optimism . Banff is a long main street , decked with nylon banners , pinks and blues and whites , shops with signs in English , French , Japanese , and Snowboarder . Banff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasts yet another grand Canadian Pacific chateau , the Banff Springs Hotel , all multistoried towers and buttresses and endless gables . A town full of stone and logs and Rocky Mountain history . A town that 's overcrowded in summer , but merely animated in winter . Banff is smoked salmon , Inuit art , luxury leather and fur with hang tags in Japanese , plaid shirts in the Hudson Bay store , and local beer in the pubs . And Banff is scenery : the snowplastered flat-iron slabs of Mount Rundle angling up into space , the chunky cliffs and snowfields of Mt . Norquay lined up at the end of Banff Avenue by a cosmic marksman , Vermilion Lakes on the edges of town , and the spray from Bow Falls . Photograph Photograph Skiing the front side of Lake Louise . Opposite : On the steeps of Goat 's Eye above the " base village " at Sunshine Village . Photograph " Ho hum , powder again " : Another lousy sunshiny day at Sunshine Village . Opposite : What you look out at from the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banff . It is not a chic , jet-set ski town , no Vail or Aspen , no Courchevel , but it 's no Wal-Mart resort either . The price tags do not trumpet the special discounts for Americans , but the weakness of the Canadian dollar yields an automatic 25 percent off . Baniff 's big ski area is Sunshine Village . And Sunshine is a trip in more ways than one . A 20-minute trip from town up the Trans Canada Highway , up a side canyon marked with avalanche warnings to a lost parking lot in the middle of nowhere-not a single ski run in sight . Then another trip by gondola up a side canyon of the side canyon , around a corner-at the mid station one sees skiers , runs-and on , two and a half miles on a cable tine Village itself . The " village " is a scattered collection of flat-roofed , ' ' 60s-modem buildings , dorms , lodges , and cafeterias , in a wide Alpine basin , almost at timberline . Totally improbable . Lots of skiers throw their bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oasis to stay for a few days or a week at bargain rates . It 's a ski-in , ski-out world up here , ski-packed snow between the buildings , chairlifts heading up on all sides . True confession time : I really like Sunshine , but I fell in love with Lake Louise . What 's the difference ? Not just size , because Sunshine is big too , although not nearly as big . I 'd simply say that Lake Louise promises more to the expert skier , while Sunshine seems more intermediate-friendly . At Sunshine , the main upper area at the end of the gondola has a very European ski flavor , treeless low-angle snowfields , an abundance of open bluish-green slopes , wide mountainsides-not trails-because almost immediately you are skiing above timberline . Emerging from the gondola , you look up at hundreds , thousands of colored dots drifting down these wide slopes in slow motion . Once you 're up there , on the slopes of Lookout Mountain , you gasp . The main crest of the Rockies unfolds westward , into British Columbia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearing in layers of soft haze and aerial perspective . A massive pyramid , Mount Assiniboine , the Matterhorn of the Canadian Rockies , tries to monopolize your gaze . Mountains march off forever . Last season , Sunshine opened a new zone of blue and black skiing called Goat 's Eye , a 1,900-foot vertical pitch , separated from the main runs and lifts around Sunshine Village by a barrier of rocky summits , the Eagles . Those skiers we saw as our gondola passed the midstation were schussing down off its lower slopes . Goat 's Eye is served by a single quad chair . And we discover that Goat 's Eye alone merits a day to explorehigh praise for terrain served by just one lift . It 's a concave mountainside , starting slow and gentle at the top , then steepening and steepening until finally you realize that you 're working , not loafing . A single easy intermediate trail sweeps across and around Goat 's Eye in a giant S , traversing across the mountain just before the slope reaches its most serious angle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down through krummholz forests . The upper half of Goat 's Eye is treeless and vast , and its western flank promises a bit more off-piste intensity , with names like Vertigo and Ewe First . This side is spiced with rock gendarmes and cliffs , and full of cut-up wind crust-not for everyone . Out in the middle of this big slope , a series of signs and flags marks a very arbitrary ski-area boundary . Tracks on both sides of this conceptual dotted line tell me that the boundary is more honored in the breach than the observance . I catch myself thinking : at Lake Louise , this face would be open . But I do n't think too hard or too long . There 's too much to ski , too much vertical , too much fun . What you ski is what you get , and we ski it all . At the end of a long day , there 's only one mystery left : the name Goat 's Eye . A local in the parking lot points upward . " See that big hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? That 's it , the goat 's eye . " Well yes , why not ? As a destination , Banff/Lake Louise is more han a resort , it 's a ski region . The oc 4g ski areas , Sunshine and Lake Louise , are so close to each other , and to Baniff , that no matter where you 're staying , it 's no problem to switch from one to the other according to your whim , your skiing , tastes , the weather . All the while , you can reserve Mt . Norquay for really stormy days , when the other , more-Alpine areas would have their heads in the clouds . You do n't even need a rental car as there are frequent bus connections between Banff , Sunshine , and Lake Louise ; and also between Banff and Norquay . But you do need a special skier 's sense of adventure to get the most out of a visit to these spectacular Canadian Rockies . For me , it has to do with mixing skiing and discovery . The thirst to ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Another side of the mountain that you have n't even seen yet . Another mountain altogether . This is the antithesis of what certain cynics call yo-yo skiing , the perfect polished repetition of slopes you know by heart . For me the pleasure of skiing , and discovering , new mountains is as strong today as it was 20 years ago . I just ca n't get enough . And I find it a lot more exciting to feel that I 'm skiing a whole mountain , or a mountain range , rather than just a trail or a run . Banff/Lake Louise is exactly such a ski destination , big enough , different enough , to promise you a week of discoveries . Across a whole mountain range . And surprise-it 's insanely affordable . Banff is lively and different . Lake Louise is wildly romantic . In our week there , Linde and I reconnected with the romance of ski travel-why it 's worth the planning , the trouble and the time to go somewhere else , somewhere new , somewhere far away , to ski. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
