<p> In her Edith Wharton book group , Eva Maas had studied the wry social commentary of the novelist , but the artful prose came to life quite literally when Maas saw the theater company Word for Word perform the Wharton short story " Xingu " last summer . <p> " There 's something about hearing them say these witty things that is different from reading them yourselves and talking about it in a group , " says Maas , a retired family therapist . " It makes you realize how many stories would do so well with a dramatic presentation . " <p> Performing short works of fiction is exactly what Word for Word does . The 1 1/2-year-old company co-founded by San Francisco public librarian Susan Harloe and actress/waitress Joanne Winter , transfers stories into one-act plays , reciting every word on the page . <p> " We have an elegant but understated aesthetic , " Harloe says . " We want people to see the language . " <p> Those who have discovered Word for Word see the language like they 've never seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocking , timing and inflection , the story becomes a play in which audience members ca n't get lost trying to figure out what a character is thinking . <p> " It 's kind of like Hamlet speaking a monologue , or a soliloquy , " says Winter , 35 . " A character will start talking almost directly to the audience , but is in esence thinking out loud . " <p> Word for Word is user-friendly theater in which the audience does n't have to labor over subtext . The actors announce it for us , along with the " he said , she said , " attributions and parenthetical descriptions . It 's in the bylaws  --  whatever is on the page is said out loud , word for word . <p> In the case of Wharton 's " Xingu , " a spoof on high-society pretensions in a women 's reading group in a stuffy New York commuter town , three characters split the following passage , gathering momentum and laughs along the way : <p> Mrs. Plinth bristled . " We have a great many representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who speaks for her order . Osrick Dane turned to her . " What do they represent ? " she asked . Mrs. Plinth 's constitutional dislike to being questioned was intensified by her sense of unpreparedness . " We have a standard , " said Mrs. Plinth , feeling herself suddenly secure on the vast expanse of a generalization : and Mrs. Leveret , thinking there must be room for more than one on so broad a statement , took courage to murmur : " Oh , certainly ; we have a standard . " <p> The rhythm and flow of Wharton 's style surely would have been diluted in a playwright 's rendering . " If we had adapted this into a play script , you would get our interpretation of the story , " Winter says , " whereas in this form hopefully you get Edith Wharton 's interpretation , plus the interpretation of the director and the actors to go with that . " <p> Dialogue is fairly easy to assign to characters . The challenge is in descriptive passages where no one is speaking or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving . <p> " We do n't want to just stand there and do it , " Harloe says . " We 're not giving a monologue . " In " Xingu , " the problem of how to work the phrase " each waited for the other to speak " was solved when the seven actors split up the passage one word apiece , creating the effect that each character was doing what the line required  --  waiting for the others to speak . <p> Five characters shared this speech : <p> " Oh certainly , the ' Wings of Death ' is not amusing , " ventured Mrs. Leveret , whose manner of putting forth an opinion was like that of an obliging salesman with a variety of other styles to submit if his first selection does not suit . " Was it ' meant to be ' ? " inquired Mrs. Plinth , who was fond of asking questions that she permitted no one but herself to answer . " Assuredly not . " " Assuredly not  --  that is what I was going to say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching for another . <p> " They do n't have somebody rewrite the story as a play , they just take it how it is , " says Maas , 76 , who was so taken with the clever portrayal of " Xingu " at the Bayfront Theater that she hung around afterward and invited Word for Word to perform the piece for the Wharton Club at her home in Parnassus Heights . <p> So , for the Actor 's Equity minimum of $ 350 , the entire seven-woman cast in full Victorian costume , with props , brought " Xingu " into Maas ' living room . The setting was perfect for Wharton 's send-up on the fussy intellectual platitudes of society women . <p> " There 's a lot of direct contact if you 're playing it right in the room where the people are sitting , " Maas said . <p> In addition to theaters and living room salons , Word for Word has visited libraries and classrooms . Starting Wednesday , the group will deliver weekly lunchtime performances at a studio on Geary Street . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create work for other people and then there 's the whole literacy angle , " Harloe says , " to bring this love of literature to people and make them love to read . " <p> Harloe , a librarian and actress with a master 's degree in drama from UC Davis , discovered the medium in Seattle , where she saw a show by a troupe called Book-It in 1990 . <p> " It was as if someone had opened a book and these characters jumped out of it , " recalls Harloe , who was so spellbound she joined the group and became co-artistic director . <p> " If you see a story performed word for word , you get a feeling for the author 's voice , for the way the author puts words together , " Harloe says . " And it 's a very exciting challenge for an actor . It really hones the craft because you have to make active choices to activate the narrative . " <p> When Harloe moved home to San Francisco in 1993 , she brought the concept with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-running Bay Area production of " Noises Off , " flew to Seattle to help Harloe move , and by the end of the 15-hour drive back they had a name for their new company  --  Word of Mouth , and a first piece , " Standard of Living " by Dorothy Parker . <p> When they discovered Word of Mouth was being used by another group , they changed their group 's name to Word for Word and performed " Standard of Living " for an audience of 100 in July 1993 at Z Space Studios , South of Market . <p> It was just Harloe , Winter and actor John Balma , and two chairs on the stage . " The language is what carries it , " Harloe says . Apparently , it did . <p> " People were cheering , " she recalls . " It was so exciting to see these words come to life and actors working in a new form . " <p> Within a year the charter group of seven had a repertoire of a dozen pieces and attracted a sellout crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayfront . <p> " The main thing is we want it to be really strong literature , " Harloe says . " Because we take nothing out . Not one word . " <p> Writer Harriet Doerr learned this last month when Word for Word performed " The Doctor of the Moon , " a chapter from her novel " Stones for Ibarra , " at the Main Library in San Francisco . Doerr , 84 , flew in from her Pasadena home for the show . It was the first time she had seen or heard of anything like it , and the first time an author had seen an interpretation by Word for Word . <p> " I had my private fears , " Doerr admits , " but they calmed me as soon as they started . " <p> Sixty people gathered in a reading room to hear the actors perform . " The old man turned his face , " one actor says , as he turns his face . Other movements are more subtle and would be nearly impossible to portray in a traditional play : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks  --  entered her mind and lingered there . " Try acting that one out . <p> When introduced to the audience afterward , Doerr said , " I was very happy with what you did . This play . May I call it that ? " <p> The form is so new that nobody is sure what to call it . But whatever it is called , Doerr was pleased to see her work introduced to some people who might be more inclined to watch than read . <p> " Some people in that audience had never read the original and got their full impression from that , " the author says . " Any kind of performed event is quite different from reading yourself , when your own imagination informs the characters . " <p> In the case of a tidy short story , Doerr felt it worked , though she is sure the form has its limitations . " I do n't know how they could suddenly take out a chapter of ' War and Peace ' or something , " she says . <p> Word for Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers to the classic . Cultural literacy is what the group is about . If its members can get some work out of it as actors , that 's fine , too . <p> The next big evening run will be in February . A piece has not yet been decided upon , but research is in the works . <p> " There 's no end of great scripts and using that kind of language really elevates the performance , " Winter says . " And it 's really exciting for people to have that kind of language in live theater .
