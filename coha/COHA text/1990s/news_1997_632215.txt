<p> Melissa Terpstra wants to teach , likes to learn , and knows that a good set of academic credentials can help her do both . <p> So Terpstra , a high-achieving St. Xavier University junior , is at work on two academic minors , in history and sociology , in addition to her liberal arts major in English . <p> Rarely required for graduation from most area colleges and universities , the academic minor is becoming an increasingly popular credential to collect , especially among career-conscious liberal arts undergraduates such as Terpstra . <p> At St. Xavier , where liberal arts enrollment is growing , academic advising and testing director Maureen Wogan estimates one out of four students is working on a minor , an organized array of courses in a student 's secondary field of interest . That 's up from one in 10 two to three years ago . <p> " We do recommend they minor , " Wogan said . " It is not only to be more competitive , but it is something that a student can do to enhance their academic experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as internships and the academic minor , make applicants more attractive , whether the job they seek is in business , in government or in schools . <p> " Sometimes it is not the main course that attracts you , it is the salad , " said L. Patrick Scheetz , who directs the Collegiate Employment Research Institute at Michigan State University . <p> Scheetz reports annually on employment prospects for new graduates . Employers value credentials that indicate expertise , he noted . <p> " Employers ' preference is that the minor would be a major , " Scheetz said . " They would prefer two majors . " <p> Nineteen-year-old Terpstra gets the message . She is preparing to compete for the job she 'll need to pay for graduate school . <p> She loves the courses that will lead to her history and sociology minors , almost as much as the English literature courses that she hopes one day to teach herself in a college or university . <p> " I am planning to go for my master 's and teach high school while I am doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a more interesting applicant to prospective employers , she reasoned , and more flexible , too . <p> " History and sociology are fields where there are lots of opportunities , if you want to teach in high school , or ( work ) as a counselor , " she said . <p> Interest in academic minors is up among students at Loyola University Chicago , too . <p> " Students who declare minors have increased in recent years , " said college of arts and sciences senior associate Dean Thomas Petzel . " It is not unusual for students to double major and double minor . <p> " Sometimes , it is purely out of . . . academic and scholarly interest , " Petzel said , " and , I have to admit , sometimes it is to make them more employable . " <p> In the past couple of years , he said , Loyola has developed seven new interdisciplinary minors , in neuroscience ; international studies ; black world studies ; women 's studies ; peace studies ; religion , culture and society ; and Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the last local institutions to demand a minor of all graduates , dropped the requirement for liberal arts students early this fall , part of a curriculum change and a calendar move from quarters to semesters . <p> The change reduced the total number of courses in each student 's program . <p> Still , the option remains available for purposeful planners , or for students who have changed course mid-stream and whose now-rejected majors can become impressive minors . <p> St. Xavier 's Wogan endorsed the optional alternative . <p> " We have explored the possibility of requiring the minor , " Wogan said . " But I think we will continue encouraging students to minor . " <p> At Valparaiso University in Indiana , the minor has been an option for decades , said registrar Ann Trost . <p> For students who earn a 40-credit major , no minor is required . " They 've obviously gone into depth , " said Trost . <p> But , at 36 credits or below , you 'd need to choose a second major or a minor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had at least another area that was supportive , another cognate area that would support the first major . " <p> One out of every three Valparaiso undergraduates is working this year on an academic minor . <p> Some universities are introducing or re-introducing the minor . <p> Four years ago , for the first time , Northwestern University adopted academic minors for liberal arts students . <p> " We wanted to give students the opportunity to have some guidance in choosing a constellation of courses that would be a good introduction to a field , and not a hodgepodge , " said NU associate dean for academic advising Mike Stein . <p> Departments define the nature of minors . " Generally , the faculty rules are six to nine courses with substantial work at the advanced undergraduate level , " Stein explained . <p> In 1987 , the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign approved guidelines for academic minors on the campus where they had once been required of all arts and sciences students , then discontinued in the early ' 80s in favor of " supporting coursework . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " observed liberal arts and sciences assistant dean Dr. Lucy Rich . " Now , students are interested in increasing their credentials . " <p> " We went back and Rich . <p> Gradually , departments have begun to offer more minors and U. of I. students have become aware of the opportunity to earn them . <p> Since August , 1993 , nearly one out of 10 U. of I. graduates has completed a minor , increasing from 6 percent of graduates in May , 1994 , to 13.4 percent in May , 1997 . <p> " Some do it because they are interested in the subject area , " Rich said . " Others do it because they would like to see the credential show up . <p> Rich is also working with a computer programmer to alter student transcripts so that the minor will show up there as well . <p> More popular at the University of Illinois at Chicago , academic minors are the choice of nearly a third of liberal arts students . <p> When 455 students recently " declared " readiness for graduation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three had two minors each , said UIC associate dean John Nicolette . All UIC departments offer minors , but they 're not required for graduation . <p> " Not many students in liberal arts and sciences get internships , " said Nicolette . On the largely commuter campus , many already hold full- or part-time jobs , he noted . <p> On many campuses in recent years , one of the most popular job-leveraging credentials has been completion of the undergraduate internship , a paid or unpaid job-cum-learning experience viewed as a potential lead-in to permanent employment . <p> " Students assume that if they have had an internship , that is going to carry them a really long way , " said Eastern Illinois University academic advising and learning assistance director Mary Kelm . " They believe if they do n't have one they have graduated with a lesser education . Whether you can say an internship is a real-life experience , or worthwhile at all , depends on the internship . " <p> But a growing interest in minors is consistent with what Kelm sees ahead for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess that we are going to be encouraging breadth of education again , " she said . " Academia is also looking again at creating more depth . " <p> For breadth and depth , theology professor Wesley Isenberg , a leader in the Concordia curriculum changes , favors the " enriched major , " propounded by the late educator Ernest L. Boyer . " Enriched , " the major would include study of the history and tradition of a field , its social and economic implications , and the ethical and moral issues it raises . <p> At the University of Illinois in Springfield , where the emphasis is on " experiential education , " more than half of all undergraduate and graduate student interns staff state government offices and agencies as part of their educations in fields as diverse as accounting , public administration and biology . <p> " We in fact had no minors until 1987-88 , " recalled provost Wayne Penn , " when our requirements became more rigorous . " <p> In recent years , Penn said , some one-fourth to one-third of students at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer science and other technical areas . <p> " Sometimes , " he added , " they may use it to broaden their thinking . " <p> Similarly , when Valparaiso students look for jobs , registrar Trost said , " the more they can show on a transcript , the more marketable they are . . . . If not by a minor , I suppose by the mix of the classwork they put together . We have internships and cooperative education , and they are all part of the major . Internships or cooperative education would lead to more job opportunities than a minor . "
