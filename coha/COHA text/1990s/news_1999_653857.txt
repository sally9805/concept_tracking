<p> Millions of people across Latin America are , for better or worse , getting a taste of American-style health insurance . Pushed by the rising expectations of a growing middle class , countries in the region are opening their government-dominated health systems to private companies , both domestic and foreign . <p> Some of the biggest United States insurers , seeing Latin America as a prime growth market , are actively testing the waters from Mexico to Argentina , Brazil and Chile . Latin Americans already spend $120 billion annually on health care , or about $412 per capita , adjusted to reflect local health costs . While this is only about one-ninth of the total health spending in the United States , the big Latin American countries are spending a much bigger share of their economies on health than all the Asia-Pacific economies except Japan . <p> Aetna International has already put together health plans with 3.3 million members in seven Latin American countries . The Cigna International health care unit has 1.5 million members in five countries . American International Group has more than 300,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , government officials , physicians and health care workers there are all too aware of the problems of managed care in the United States , which include disputes over the decision-making authority of doctors and growing numbers of people without health coverage . But they hope to avoid similar pitfalls . Doctors ' groups in Brazil and Ecuador and the powerful Government-allied unions in Argentina , in fact , have resisted moves to privatize health care . <p> " The negative part of the picture , " said William C. Hsiao , director of health systems studies at the Harvard School of Public Health , " is that the private health plans in these countries compete by selecting the best risks "  --  recruiting predominantly young and healthy members and avoiding people who would be likely to need costly treatments . <p> " The insurance companies take the cream off the top : employees of banks , high-tech companies , large multinationals , " Professor Hsiao said . They do not operate in the countryside , where health services have always been sparse . Governments have tried to provide at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , exploding populations and the rising cost of care have swamped the public system as life expectancy in Latin America has risen to 71 years , about five years less than it is in the United States . <p> Wealthy Latin Americans still go to prestigious medical centers in the United States and Europe , as they always have , or to Rio de Janeiro , a world capital of cosmetic surgery . But middle-class working people , who often must wait in line for hours at overtaxed clinics , have lost patience with the public system . <p> With encouragement from the World Bank and other Washington lending agencies that promote privatization , Chile , Colombia and Brazil have lowered the bars that had kept out foreign-owned health companies . Argentina and Mexico have taken the first such steps and may go further after their coming presidential elections . Seeking Payoffs Down the Road <p> Managed care is an often contentious concept both north and south of the Rio Grande , and American companies are avoiding the term . But they are preparing the ground for managed care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice patterns of physicians and hospitals , and help supervise patients with expensive problems . <p> " We have not used the term ' managed care ' in Argentina , " said Mark Tabak , chief executive of International Managed Care Advisers , a New York-based fund that invested $50 million in a joint start-up venture with Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires . The plan , Provincia Salud , calls its business " coordinated care , " he said . <p> Revenues of private health care companies are growing much faster in Latin America than in the United States , where managed care has matured into a slow-growth field with slim profits . American International Group says its revenues in the region are growing 20 percent annually on average . <p> Chris James , a senior vice president of Cigna International health care , said the number of health insurance customers and the amounts they would be able to spend were growing significantly . <p> " These markets are already larger than most countries in the Asia-Pacific region , except Japan , " he said . " More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International has invested $510 million in health care ventures in Latin America over the last five years . Cigna has invested $475 million overseas since 1997 , most of it in health care in Brazil . <p> Both Aetna and Cigna had $800 million or more in Latin American health care revenues last year . Profits have been modest so far , but the companies project substantial payoffs down the road . <p> One reason for that forecast is that relatively easy savings  --  what health care consultants call the low-hanging fruit  --  are still there to pick . For example , there are the big initial savings like those that managed care concerns reaped in the United States by paying hospitals a fixed amount for each patient or a low negotiated rate . As hospitals sent patients home sooner , charges dropped for employers and insurance companies . <p> Also , unlike the United States market , the private insurance market in many Latin American countries is not closely regulated . <p> " Each country is on a different time frame , " said Howard Kahn , vice president for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sensitive to the medical culture , the social culture , the stage of economic development . " Greater Access , And Room to Grow <p> Some middle-class Latin Americans with good jobs say they are glad to have private coverage , which so far has included few restrictions on care . <p> " Obviously , I 'm happy , " said Alejandra Couto , 34 . Her son Tomas , a premature baby who weighed less than 2 pounds at birth , was treated for 10 weeks in a well-equipped Buenos Aires hospital that is part of a big health care company that Aetna bought in January for $120 million . Tomas , now 3 months old , has thrived , Ms. Couto said . <p> " In public hospitals you can have one nurse for eight infants , " she said . " Here , it 's one nurse for every two babies . " <p> Ms. Couto said she paid $28 each month for coverage that her American-owned employer , Foxboro Argentina , arranged with the Aetna unit , Asistencia Medica Social Argentina . Her employer picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The good news , Professor Hsiao of Harvard said , is that public and private hospital officials and physicians " all begin to think a new way "  --  they become alert to making the system more cost-effective and efficient , which may someday lead to better care . " These countries are spending a significant amount of money for health care , " he said . <p> According to the World Bank 's latest figures , Brazil spends 6.8 percent of its gross domestic product on health care , Chile 7.9 percent and Argentina 9.7 percent . The United States spent 13.5 percent of its gross domestic product on health care in 1997 , the most recent data available . <p> Poor , elderly working people who were fully covered by Government social security programs now must come up with co-payments in Chile and Argentina . This presents " enormous barriers to access , " said Dr. Howard Waitzkin of the University of New Mexico , one of the authors of a survey of the growth of managed care in Latin America published in The New England Journal of Medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gen. Augusto Pinochet , taking advice from advocates of a free market who had been trained at the University of Chicago , began to privatize in the early 1980 's . But private insurers still cover fewer than 5 percent of those over 60 and typically charge higher premiums to women of childbearing age , said Cristian Baeza , a former head of the national insurance fund in Chile who is joining the department of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University . <p> Alejandro Ferreiro , a Government official who supervises health insurance in Chile , said , " The current system of risk selection is based on economic logic , but this does not make political or social logic . " <p> Employers , especially American companies , yearn for anything to hold costs down . But some expensive local practices may be hard to change . Employees at one multinational in Brazil had a choice of three health plans and could go to doctors belonging to any of them at any time , said Helen Darling , a managed care expert at the employee-benefits consulting firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that an employee has " lent " his health plan identification card to a " cousin . " <p> " We run into that a lot , " Mr. Kahn of Aetna said . But insurance companies have to proceed carefully . " We try to stay a step ahead of the competition , " he added , but if a company gets " too far out in front , it may lose customers . <p> " What we consider clear fraud in the United States may not be considered fraud in some places , " Mr. Kahn continued . A Tempting Niche . . . And Politics <p> In Brazil , the colossus of the region , 40 million people are covered by hundreds of private health plans , from traditional fee-for-service plans to varying degrees of managed care . Many plans are cooperatives owned by physicians , but American insurers and venture capital funds hope to scoop them up and install their own management methods . <p> One giant federation of co-ops there , Unimed , which has 11 million members and 87,000 doctors , seems too big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. James of Cigna said . " The public system does n't work . Per capita spending on health is less than $300 , " compared with more than $3,900 in the United States in 1997 . <p> More than 60 percent of Argentina 's 37 million people have some coverage , mainly through labor union plans called obras sociales . <p> " No private company would do what we do to prevent disease and improve the life style of our members , " said Alberto Antoniotti , the administrator of the Primero de Mayo clinic in La Matanza , an industrial city near Buenos Aires . The clinic is operated by a union that represents education workers . <p> But members of small , weak unions typically get lower-quality care in poorly equipped clinics , and at least 11 million people in Argentina have no coverage at all . <p> In his office , surrounded by photographs of Eva Peron  --  who is still revered as the patron saint of the obras sociales  --  Jose Luis Lingeri , the superintendent of the system , said people who now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the weaker union plans merge into stronger plans . <p> Meanwhile , critics say funds earmarked for health often vanish into political slush funds and the pockets of union officials . " The problem is , we have a political system that corrupts , " said Hector Carrica , a health care official of Argentine Workers Central , a 750,000-member federation that competes with the much larger unions allied with the big Peronist party . <p> Two million people , most of them middle class , are covered by prepaid plans like the Aetna-owned company , which has 240,000 members . Each provides access to one or two hospitals and a list of doctors , much like a preferred provider network in the United States . <p> The World Bank lent Argentina $350 million to revise its system and make it easier for obras sociales to deal with private managed care companies . But the politically powerful Peronist unions blocked President Carlos Saul Menem 's deregulation program in Congress . <p> Blue Cross plans are also looking for Latin American opportunities . Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Delaware has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan in Uruguay and plans to expand in Argentina , where it already offers coverage to people who go to United States medical centers . Blue Shield of California and the Blues plans in Texas and Arizona have a joint venture that intends to open shop in Mexico when it gets the go-ahead from the Government . <p> " It is natural for the private sector to move into the health system because public resources are so scarce , " said Antonio Palocci , a public health doctor in Brazil who is also a Workers Party member of Congress . " But I worry about foreign groups coming in , because they might view health care more as a business than a basic service .
