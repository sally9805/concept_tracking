The scheme took shape , according to Japanese police , early in the evening of Monday , Sept. 4 , the Labor Day holiday for Americans . Four U.S. servicemen stationed on Okinawa , home base to 29,000 American troops , met at a disco in Naha , the island 's main city , and talked about grabbing an Okinawan girl and having some " fun . " One man quickly backed out , but , he later told investigators , the other three , two Marines and a sailor , decided to cruise the seaside boulevards in search of prey . <P> After a few drinks , but still far from drunk , they left in a rented white Subaru sedan and headed toward Camp Hansen , home of a Marine Corps base , about 25 miles away on the island 's east side . At about 8 p.m. they spotted a girl walking alone on a well-lighted stretch of road lined with storefronts and homes . The 12-year-old elementary school student had walked five minutes from her home to buy a notebook for school , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped alongside the girl , and two men got out . They said something to her in English , which she did not understand . Before she knew what was happening , they had thrown her into the back seat of the car , where they bound her eyes , mouth , arms and legs with tape . A little more than half a mile up the road , they parked , pulled their victim from the car and carried her to a deserted stretch of beach . They tore off the tape , and for 15 minutes at least two of the men raped her , before driving away . <P> The crime was far from the first or even the worst committed by American troops in the half-century they have been stationed in Japan . Nonetheless , the Okinawa rape is the biggest shock to the U.S.-Japan security alliance in years . Last week major Japanese newspapers called for a revision of the agreement governing the presence of U.S. forces in their country , and some even questioned Japan 's $4.8 billion contribution to the upkeep of the 94 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okinawa 's Governor , flew to Tokyo to lodge a protest with U.S. Ambassador Walter Mondale and the Japanese government . Ota and most other Okinawans want the island 's 40 American facilities , which occupy 20% of its land , to be moved elsewhere . Now that the Russian threat to Japan has receded , many Okinawans have lost patience with daily live-fire exercises , roaring F-15 jets and rowdy American service members . Polls show that as many as 80% of the islanders want the bases either closed or greatly reduced in size . " The people , " says Ota , " are fed up with the problems that go with living so close to huge bases in a small area . " <P> Hardly anyone in Washington or Tokyo believes the current furor will lead to the closing of the bases . They are still important for Japan 's defense , especially given tensions with North Korea and China , as well as for the credibility of the U.S. security commitment to Asia . In 1991 U.S. Marines and logistics units based in Okinawa played a crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made U.S. officials uneasy because this week Tokyo and Washington plan to sign a five-year agreement covering Japan 's financial contribution to the support of the American troops . In addition , President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama plan to stress the importance of their countries ' defense ties during the November meeting in Osaka of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum .
