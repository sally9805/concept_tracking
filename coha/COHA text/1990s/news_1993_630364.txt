But as the party struggles to avoid a 60-seat Democratic majority in the Senate , shutting off filibusters and meaningful debate on reams of liberal legislation , is it still a productive one ? Assuming Norm Coleman 's legal fortuneswhich are at this writing dire- do n't soon improve , Democrats will be one seat away from that magic number . Even if 2010 is otherwise a good year for Republicans , the GOP is nevertheless expected to defend 19 Senate seats to the Democrats ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . While playing defense in Florida , Ohio , Missouri , New Hampshire , and Kentucky , Republicans need a few states where they can go on the offensive . One unexpected opportunity has emerged in deepblue Connecticut , where Sen. Chris Dodd is paying the price for his role in the financial meltdown and his embarrassing 2008 presidential campaign . Former Rep. Rob Simmons appears to be the strongest challenger , having already taken a commanding lead in the polls . But Simmons is no fire-breathing conservative . His lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union is 55 percent , middling for just any member of Congress , astonishingly low for a Republican . What 's a conservative to do ? The problem presents itself again in Pennsylvania , where Sen. Arlen Specter is standing for a sixth term . National Review once declared Specter the " worst Republican senator " and he cast a pivotal vote for President Obama 's $787 billion stimulus package to remind conservative Pennsylvanians why . Enter Club for Growth president Pat Toomey , who looks likely to challenge Specter in the Republican primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took the combined strength of President Bush and Sen. Rick Santorum to shove Specter across the finish line by less than 1 percent of the vote . This time around there have been conflicting poll results , but no reputable survey has found Specter attracting the support of more than a third of Republicans . Yet the incumbent does much better with independents and Democrats , suggesting he would still be formidable in November if his candidacy can make it that far . The dilemma has prompted a new round of questions about conservative primary challengers in general . Outfits like Toomey 's Club for Growth have never been popular with liberal Republicans , who want the freedom to raise taxes and prefer pale pastels to bold colors . But even now some complain they are hurting the party . Former Federal Elections Commission chairman Bradley Smith charged that " few have done more to run northeastern moderates out of the party or worked harder to shrink the party 's base . " Blogger and American Conservative columnist Daniel Larison calls them the " Club for Democratic Growth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin with one of the biggest showdowns in history between a more moderate GOP incumbent and a conservative challenger : the 1976 contest between Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan . Ford was an unelected president , Reagan a 65-yearold former California governor and Hollywood actor . Ford eventually prevailed in the drawn-out primary struggle , but ended up making concessions on the Republican platform and replacing Nelson Rockefeller on the national ticket . He was also upstaged by Reagan at the Republican National Convention . Ford went on to lose the general election to Jimmy Carter by a narrow margin . You can find political analysts who contend that Reagan 's primary challenge , rather than pardons or Poland , hurt Ford in November . Ford himself was said to believe some version of this . You 'll search for a long time for someone who will claim that Carter 's presidency hurt the Republican Party . Reagan opened a three-election , 40-plus state winning streak for the GOP in 1980 . In 1978 , conservative activist Jeffrey Bell upset four-term liberal Republican Sen. Clifford Case in the New Jersey primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star Bill Bradley , an election Case could conceivably have won . But moderateto-liberal Republicans Millicent Fenwick , Christine Todd Whitman , Dick Zimmer , Bob Franks , and Tom Kean Jr . all subsequently lost Senate races in New Jersey . In Massachusetts the same year as the CaseBell primary , liberal Republican Sen. Edward Brooke bested conservative primary challenger Avi Nelson and still lost the general anyway . Two years later , conservative Alfonse D'Amato toppled four-term liberal Republican Sen. Jacob Javits in New York during the GOP primary and went on to victory in November . D'Amato 's generalelection prospects were aided by the fact that Javits remained on the ballot as the Liberal Party nominee , taking 11 percent of the vote and splitting the liberal base . But Reagan also carried New York in 1980 . D'Amato managed to retain his Senate seat in two very difficult election cycles , 1986 and 1992 , before being " Schumed " out of office by Democrat Chuck Schumer in 1998 . But the biggest threat to Rockefeller Republicans has never been conservative primary challengers . Only twice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one incumbent GOP senator faced a serious intra-party challenge . The principal reason RINOs have become an endangered species is the Democratic tilt of the areas moderate to liberal Republicans tend to represent . The more conservative Republican Party of D'Amato and Bell did n't send as many people to Congress from places like Massachusetts as did the party of Javits and Case . But during the 1980s and ' 90s , at least , the more ideologically cohesive GOP won more elections overall . HAS THIS CHANGED now that groups like the Club for Growth systematically promote conservative primary challengers , perhaps pushing the GOP 's rightward movement to the point of diminishing returns ? Doubtful . Despite the races that receive the most attention , the Club spends far more money trying to elect Republicans than defeat them . The Club has helped oust exactly two Republican incumbents : Joe Schwarz in Michigan , whose challenger won in November but was defeated in a reelection bid ; and Wayne Gilchrest in Maryland , whose challenger lost the general election . Democrats won the Gilchrest seat by 916 votes only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican nominee , state Sen. Andy Harris . The Democrats picked up the Schwarz seat in a similar fashion : Schwarz endorsed and campaigned for the Democratic challenger to freshman Rep. Tim Walberg , who had bested him in the 2006 primary . Walberg lost by two points . Neither district is lost to Republicans forever ; nor is the Idaho seat held for one term by Club-backed Rep. Bill Sali , who lost to Blue Dog Democrat Walt Minnick in 2008 . In recent Senate races , Specter beat back a Club-supported primary challenge from Toomey and won in November despite conservative defections to Constitution Party candidate Jim Clymer . In 2006 , Rhode Island 's Lincoln Chafee similarly repelled Club-endorsed Steve Laffey and lost the general election even though exit polls showed him carrying 94 percent of self-described Republicans . In New Mexico 's open Senate seat in 2008 , the Club favored conservative Rep. Steve Pearce over fellow Rep. Heather Wilson . Pearce got pasted in November , but Wilson did n't poll any better and barely hung on to her own House seat in 2006 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club for Growth has n't always won tough elections , but it has played a role in very few Republican losses . From a strictly electoral perspective , conservatives may not be the right candidates for every race but their participation in GOP primaries has pushed the party to the right on taxes , guns , abortion , and national security . Soon the Democrats will get their own taste of competitive primary politics . Starting in 2010 , the Accountability NOW political action committee will support challengers to insufficiently liberal incumbent Democrats . The project is strongly backed by the netroots , including blogger Jane Hamsher of Firedoglake and Glenn Greenwald of Salon , which played a role in Ned Lamont 's 2006 primary challenge to Joe Lieberman . Political parties may need every seat they can get . Movements that are committed to ideas and policies often have a higher standard .
