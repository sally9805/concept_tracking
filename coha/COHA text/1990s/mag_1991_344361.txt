The Protestant churches seem obsessed with sex these days . Not that their interest in the subject is new . Puritan disquisitions on sex were so plainspoken that early 20th century editions of them had to be bowdlerized . But the terms of today 's discussion are revolutionary  --  not Why do men sin ? but Why should n't they party ? Traditional strictures against homosexuality , premarital sex ( once called fornication ) , even adultery , are up for theological debate . The Presbyterians in conclave assembled gave thumbs down to the new morality ; the Episcopalians gave thumbs sideways ; the United Methodist Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America will not be far behind in giving their thumb signals . Bees do it ; do Wasps ? <P> Roman Catholics have caught the bug too ( as in so many other areas , liberal American Catholics find themselves playing catch-up with their Protestant soul mates ) . Their arguments over sex are complicated by the fact that the Vatican , the ultimate source of authority in their church , is not known for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what it hears on Oprah . Or from Protestants . <P> The obvious secular explanation for this hubbub is that America 's churches are internalizing the mores of a developed society . Once the automobile , the college dorm and the Pill became almost universally available , it was inevitable that men and women would start their sexual careers earlier and build up longer and more varied resumes . It was also inevitable that the churches would adjust to the new reality . If that meant adjusting traditional interpretations of the Ten Commandments , so be it . <P> Like most obvious secular explanations , this one is shallow . American churches do n't just passively receive ideas from the general culture . They also stimulate them . ( Thomas Jefferson wrote about the " wall of separation " between church and state in a letter to a group of Baptist political allies . ) If America 's pews ring with debate about America 's bedrooms , that is because the churches have their own reasons for grappling with the subject . <P> What we are witnessing is in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Traditionalists and innovators disagree about sex because they disagree about the universe , and about God . <P> Defenders of tradition are often accused of blindly upholding the social status quo . That is selling them short . Even the most conservative American churches have assailed aspects of the status quo , from dueling to saloons to the 12-hour workday . Instead the sexual conservatives see themselves as defending divinely given guides to human behavior . Fundamentalists look for these instructions primarily in scripture , such as St. Paul 's comments on homosexuality . Conservatives who are not fundamentalists can agree that the God who made covenants with ancient Israel and with the church wants sexuality to be restricted to the covenant of matrimony.
