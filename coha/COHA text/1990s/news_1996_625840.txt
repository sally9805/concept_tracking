<p> PHILADELPHIA - You have heard Jimmy Young is punch-drunk , but you do n't want to believe it . <p> And Jimmy Young looks good from a distance . He emerges from his home with a wide smile . He walks erect , head high , with the rhythmic bounce of an athlete . He 's maybe a tiny bit pot-bellied , but appears in remarkably good shape for a 47-year-old former heavyweight contender . <p> He looks worse as he gets closer . <p> He wears no socks in his filthy sneakers . A tattered shirt covers a ratty undershirt . Blue work pants sag under the belly . They are stained with grease and dirt . The pants are unzipped . <p> And just when you think the picture can get no worse , he speaks . <p> " " I 'm , you know , damn , thinking I could come back , " Young says with a slur . " " I think I can do it . I was lying there thinking , this morning , I swear I could do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> It 's 8:30 . <p> " " I got ta work at 9:30 . <p> " " You know , " he continues , smiling slyly , " " we all think we can do it . Come back . <p> " " My birthday was Tuesday , " he interjects , proud , like a child . <p> " " I turned a 4 . And a 7 . Hey , man , what time is it ? " <p> It 's 8:32 . <p> " " You know , I got ta work at , ah , 9:30 . " <p> Work for Jimmy Young now is helping out a buddy at a local garage for maybe 20 bucks a day , maybe twice a week . Work used to be fighting the likes of Muhammad Ali , George Foreman and Ken Norton . Fighting them well , for hundreds of thousands of dollars . <p> Young sent Foreman into early retirement with a win in 1977 . <p> Young fought well enough to win against Ali in 1976 , but Ali was the reigning champion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ali fight was $ 75,000 . Against Norton in ' 77 , Young collected a cool million . <p> The money 's gone now . In its place resides memory loss . <p> Slurred speech . A fighter who took blows for money for 22 years . <p> Although Young has not been formally diagnosed , his symptoms seem consistent with what doctors call " " dementia pugilistica . " And , contrary to what some in the fight community would have the public believe , it is almost inevitable . <p> It 's why former heavyweight contender Jerry Quarry needs constant supervision . It 's what makes Ali slur and shuffle as if he has Parkinson 's disease . <p> And for every Jimmy Young or Jerry Quarry or Ali , there are 50 others you never hear about . It is boxing 's shameful secret . <p> " " They 're countless , " said Philadelphian Ivan " " Mighty " Robinson , an undefeated junior welterweight . He shakes his head . " " Countless . " <p> " " This is a thing that has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry Hazzard said . " " I do n't think there 's anything you can do to prevent it . " <p> What happens to dementia pugilistica ( DP ) victims ? In layman 's terms , their brains are beaten black and blue . Over the years , the brain is scarred by the repeated trauma of punches to the head . The nerve fibers and neurons shear . The limbic system , which controls emotion and memory , is destroyed . After two or three decades , after dozens of fights and thousands of hours sparring , brain cells die . And never come back . <p> Doctors can detect the damage . It occurs with alarming regularity . <p> Some researchers estimate about half of boxers with more than 20 fights suffer from DP . Other studies reflect a 90-percent rate . In the 1995 book , Boxing and Medicine , neurosurgeon Dr.Robert C. Cantu , the book 's editor , supports the contention that sluggers , who stand toe-to-toe and take a beating , are more likely to suffer DP than more elusive , defensive boxers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of fighter you are . They say Jimmy Young , who was hard to hit , was as likely as any boxer to get punchy . <p> " " Fifty percent ? Come on , " scoffs Jimmy Binns , the former Pennsylvania boxing commissioner and currently a lawyer for the World Boxing Association . " " More like 100 percent . Without question . Anyone with more than 10 pro fights has got to suffer in some degree . I fought , and I suffer from it . There are instances of uncontrollable stuttering . Sure . " <p> Amid the admissions of boxing 's ugly result , there hangs its ever-haunting question : What , short of abolishing the sport , can be done to prevent casualties like Young and Quarry ? <p> Maybe federal legislation . Maybe stiffer rules adopted by all licensing organizations . Maybe softer gloves . <p> Maybe nothing . <p> No regulation or law exists to protect boxers from progressive DP - or from themselves . Outside the ring , as in it , self-preservation rests almost solely with the boxer himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said former welterweight champion Mark Breland . " " If you 're a good fighter , who gives a bleep if you 're punchy ? You 're going to make them money . " <p> DP studies on active boxers are rare because boxers do n't want to be told to quit , or forced to quit , said Dr. Raj Narayan , who heads the Department of Neurosurgery at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia . <p> " " They are very reluctant to participate in these studies , " Narayan said . " " It could affect their livelihood , and they do n't want to quit boxing . " <p> Binns 's assertion that all boxers suffer some degree of DP might not be far from the truth . So says Richard Mendel , who spent his youth in the Philadelphia area , boxing as an amateur and a pro . He quit to become , of all things , a neurosurgeon . <p> Mendel agrees with Binns . <p> " " I would n't be surprised , " Mendel said . " " It 's clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this syndrome . " <p> Mendel remembers seeing Young in the mid- ' 80s . <p> " " Jimmy was not in good shape then , " Mendel said . " " He clearly showed signs of slipping . " <p> And now ? <p> " " It certainly sounds like he 's gotten worse . " <p> When told of Young 's current state , Cantu concurred with Mendel . Cantu 's book cites several studies done over the past 60 years . It refers to dozens of cases , including Ali 's , in which DP appears in some degree . ( Ali is diagnosed as having Parkinson 's syndrome , which mimics Parkinson 's disease but does not have the same cause . ) <p> The symptoms mirror those of Young who , his wife and friends attest , never abused drugs or alcohol . They say he never took punishment to the head outside of the ring . <p> " " The slurring , the memory loss - those are some of the things that occur in dementia pugilistica , " Cantu said . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape with their wits intact . <p> Foreman , a paunchy punching bag , has , at 47 , marketed his girth , guts and glibness into a multimillion dollar enterprise since coming out of retirement in 1987 . Foreman seems ample but fine on the outside . He 's solid upstairs , too . <p> The International Boxing Federation asked Dr. Barry Jordan to examine Foreman before he fought Michael Moorer in November 1994 for the IBF heavyweight title . Foreman was subjected to a stringent battery of tests , said Dr. Jordan , including a CAT scan and an MRI . <p> " " Because of his age , Foreman was put through a strenuous neurological exam , " said Jordan , who stepped down as medical director for New York State Athletic Commission after 7 1/2 years this past summer . " " He passed . " <p> He passed for now , says Ferdie Pacheco , boxing 's renowned " " Fight Doctor . " <p> " " He 's not doing this with impunity , " Pacheco says . " " When he gets to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but maybe not . Randall " " Tex " Cobb is a former journeyman sluggee whose demolition at the hands of Larry Holmes in 1982 so disgusted announcer Howard Cosell that Cosell began a campaign to abolish boxing . Cobb seemed lucid and quick at a boxing dinner in October . <p> " " I have n't noticed any signs of dementia pugilistica , " Cobb said . " " I monitor my speech , my reactions . To my mind , there has n't been any significant decrease in any of those areas . " Cobb , along with Quarry , was part of a 1983 study done for a Sports Illustrated article on DP . Cobb 's results then were normal . Quarry 's were not . He showed signs of DP but continued to fight . <p> Cobb says that a recent brain scan done by his doctor , Bruce Romanczuk , was so clean that the doctor , who knew of Cobb 's pugilistic past , was astonished . Romanczuk , citing professional privilege , declined to comment for this story . <p> And then there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fastidious and sharp man in his prime , now trapped in a world of delusion . <p> Walker Moss , Young 's buddy for more than 20 years , lounges outside Young 's house . Along with the rest of the neighborhood , Moss looks out for Young . <p> " " Did you wash up , Jimmy ? " Moss asks . <p> " " I washed up last week , " Young replies , entering the house to prepare for that 9:30 job . " " Heh , heh , heh . " <p> Moss says he used to run with Young when Young was preparing for fights . He says Young 's decline picked up speed around 1986 . <p> " " He gradually started losing it , you know ? " Moss says . <p> Losing it ? <p> " " He ai n't . . . he ai n't right . You know how you and me will be having a conversation ? He ca n't . Sometimes he 'll just start talking about something else . " Often , that something else is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ca n't remember the time for more than a few seconds recalls with eerie precision the date , site and purse of each of his pro fights . <p> Young finished his career with a 35-18-3 record . The losses include : a three-round TKO by Earnie Shavers in 1973 ; the 15-round loss to Ali ; a 15-round loss to Norton in 1977 ( Young 's second fight in less than two months ) ; a 10-round loss to Michael Dokes in 1979 ; and a four-round TKO by Gerry Cooney in 1980 . <p> When Moss noticed the decline , Young was in the midst of a nine-year period in which he lost eight of 15 fights . He fought for the last time in 1990 , at the age of 41 . <p> He fought as many as five times a year in the mid- ' 70s against top fighters . He sparred almost continuously his entire career , including a stint in 1984 with a young stud named Mike Tyson . <p> The pounding brought Young a measure of wealth and fame , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 a month in Philadelphia in one of two run-down houses he believes he owns . According to Young 's wife , Barbara Young , from whom Jimmy has been separated for five years , the homes actually belong to his father , Dave Young . <p> Young rests easy at night because he thinks his family - Barbara and their five children - is financially secure . He believes they are protected by a $ 150,000 nest egg Young put away after the Norton fight . <p> The money is long gone , Barbara says . It stayed in the bank two years . His wife works two jobs to get by . <p> Young has no idea that the money is gone . <p> Jimmy Young smiles broadly when asked if he thinks he is punch-drunk . <p> " " Naw , " Young says , giggling . " " Why ? Who said I was ? " Well , J Russell Peltz , the promoter who gave you your first pro fight in 1969 , says he 's concerned that you might be . And Walker Moss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Asked if he knows what being punch-drunk is , Young replies in the affirmative . <p> " " It 's when something ai n't right with your head , " Young said . <p> He has to say it twice , slowly , to be understood . <p> Young 's head bears the signature of combat - a flat , crooked nose with a scar running sideways across it ; a thick scar under his left eye ; a ragged scar over his right . <p> Young says he underwent brain scans twice in his career , but can not , or will not , specify when . He says neither scan showed any sign of deterioration . <p> Like most boxers , Young says he would do it all again . <p> " " In a quick flash . And a hurry , " Young says . " " People ask me why I love this sport . So brutal . So hard . <p> " " I tell them what I 'll tell you . I love it . " <p> He pauses . His smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his crooked hands , sighs and speaks . <p> " " Um . Um . You , you think I 'm , um , messed up ? " <p> Yes . <p> " " It 's just , nobody never ever told me this in my whole life , " Young says , almost in a whisper . " " This is the first time anybody ever told me any of this . And you know what ? I 'm not - I 'm taking you serious , but I 'm not really thinking to what you said . " <p> Such denial is all too common . <p> " " Muhammad Ali was told years before his career ended that his speed was affected , " Cantu said . " " He just refused to believe it . " <p> Nobody told Young then , so why should he believe it now ? <p> More ramblings . More conversation . Then , admission . <p> " " I know . You know . A fighter . . . he 'll be . . . the last one to admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one to admit there is anything wrong with him . Mentally or physically . " <p> A long pause . A sad sigh . <p> " " You done burst my bubble . " <p> Another terrible facet about dementia pugilistica is its encroachment upon young boxers . In the primes of their lives , small signs can point to a large danger . Peers in the Philadelphia boxing community fear this could be the case with hometown hero Meldrick Taylor . <p> As Taylor sits in a soul-food diner , he declares himself DP free . The former welterweight champion 's dark eyes glitter ; his body , perhaps a bit padded from more than a year 's layoff , would make any 29-year-old proud . <p> " " All my faculties are intact , " Taylor says . " " I have my memory . <p> No speech impairment . So , I mean , I 'm in great , great health . " Taylor slurs badly as he says this . He says that annual medical examinations have never shown any sign of brain deterioration . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bravado of youth ? Perhaps . But doctors say DP does n't practice age discrimination . <p> An autopsy done on a 23-year-old boxer recently killed in Britain showed marked signs of advanced DP , according to Jennian Geddes of the Royal London Hospital . Besides a mild forgetfulness , that boxer seemed normal . <p> Geddes re-examined the brain of another young boxer killed eight years ago and found similar damage .
