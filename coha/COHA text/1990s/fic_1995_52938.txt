1 . Chester wanted someone on the train to notice him , ask him if he were the Chester Drummond . But the other passengers paid no attention . C-K boosted , each and every one . Before they 'd received the Carcopino-Koster treatments some of them had probably voted for Chester , maybe even cheered him at a rally . Now they ignored him , probably thought it was the only polite thing to do . <p> The bullet train rushed through the Catskills , carrying Chester into exile . It had been completed in 2017 , just about the time his Valutarian Party had reached its maximum membership . He had excoriated the train then , as an example of the deranged values of government-dominated society , a costly boondoggle , a holdover of pre-millennial thinking . He had to admit that it ran well , though . He stared out of the window . Watery gray light washed over the orange and yellow forest ; the successive hills were lost in the misty distance . Far to the north the dark purple sky was broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a storm . <p> He knew he should be updating his journal . For years he had kept the record of his every thought , his speculations , his analyses of his times , fully expecting his journals to become important historical documents . The problem was that he had nothing to say to posterity at the moment , was n't even sure he believed in it . He had lost everything : his influence , his party , his job , his apartment in SoHo . He had tried living on the streets as a political statement but the civics had scooped him up and taken him to Mt . Sinai Hospital , where he had turned down C-K one last time . He could have detonated his bomb then , but he had n't really wanted to kill anyone  --  except maybe himself . Now he was bound for the refusenik farm . <p> His dignity . That was what he had left . It had always been at the heart of his message and always would be , even if there was nobody left to inspire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . <p> At Farron 's Landing he shuffled off the train , carrying the plastic suitcase that held all his worldly possessions : journals , clothing , toothbrush , bomb . <p> " Mr. Drummond ? " A woman with dark hair approached him . " I 'm Roberta Welch . From the farm . " <p> He shook her hand , pleased to hear his name spoken , even in the condescending C-K voice . She looked to be in her late twenties , strong and pretty  --  to his taste , if a little short . He could pretend she was his handpicked chauffeur , at least until they arrived . <p> But when he followed her around the terminal building to the lot he saw immediately that he would n't have a chance to pretend . The farm had sent a lumpen electric van , not a car . And Roberta Welch had another passenger , already waiting . Fine . He 'd survive . It was n't until Chester recognized the man that he felt a sharp tug at the other end of his shred of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confessor To The All . ' Now , thought Chester , the procession of indignities begins . <p> " Chester Drummond , Emil Sanger , " said Roberta Welch , as though they were any two names in the world . Not the founder of the Valutarian Party and the father of one of the most eccentric cults in modem history . It began to rain . <p> Sanger grinned . When Chester reluctantly extended his hand , the minister took it and grasped it with both of his own . Roberta put Chester 's bag in the back of the van . Chester pulled away and climbed into the middle seat . He regretted it immediately , when Sanger followed . He should have taken the front seat ; one in the back and one in the front was importance , celebrity . Two in the back was inmates , or children . <p> They pulled out of the lot . " She 's aquiver , Chester , " said Sanger . " Such a cargo . We 're too old to be attracting fillies like her , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sanger smirked . " All the great men have been great lovers ; it 's the price of charisma . " <p> Roberta Welch plainly heard every word of this , but drove on without comment . Chester wanted to disassociate himself from the minister 's astonishing presumption but Sanger bore on . " I take it we 're here for the same purpose . " <p> " If you mean to say we 've both been reduced to the same low point , I 'll agree , " said Chester . " I do n't take it for granted that we 'll respond identically to the situation , however . " <p> Rhetoric . Chester had to admit it felt good . However dismal a debating partner , Brother Emil Sanger might , in fact , rouse him from his funk . The Carcopino-Koster drones were no use at all . They did n't argue , but instead smiled , and murmured to one another . Like a world of psychotherapists . <p> " You misunderstand , " said Sanger in his gravelly voice . " I assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my own . Something is here in this refuge that makes it a stronghold for the All . " Sanger raised his big eyebrows significantly . " Best that we not speak of it now . " <p> Chester understood that Sanger was speaking less to him than to Roberta Welch , still baiting her , with hints of secrets now , instead of affronts . Indirect address  --  Chester did n't begrudge him the technique . <p> On the other hand , he was n't much interested in continuing to provide the occasion for its use . He turned in his seat and gazed out the window , making himself unavailable . The rain was picking up . The van followed a two-lane road that twisted up into the hills , out of Farron 's Landing . <p> " I understand you have quite a library at the farm , " said Sanger . <p> " We do n't keep much hardcopy , actually , " said Welch . " But we have a four terminal datagate and unlimited free access to the Electronic Library of Congress . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Really ? " said Sanger . " And which of those are accessed most often ? " God help me , thought Chester . Or should I appeal to the mercy of the All ? <p> " Many of your books have been downloaded recently , " said Welch diplomatically . " After we learned you both were coming . " <p> " I do n't mean by the staff , " said Sanger . " Which of us is read by the other residents ? The non-C-K 's ? " <p> " I do n't know , " said Welch smoothly . " Those records are private . Perhaps neither of you is much read . . . " <p> " My work is out of print in hardcopy format , " interrupted Chester . " I 'm not interested in libraries anymore , and I would prefer that anything I 've written be erased . " <p> " Goodness , " said Sanger . " Do n't you have faith in the continued relevance of your works ? " <p> " It 's hardly a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art . I failed to predict the Carcopino-Koster treatments , and their disastrous effect on political consciousness . But , unlike you , Mr. Sanger , I never made any claims of prescience . My work always concerns itself with the present situation . Thus my early works are out of date , though they served in their time . " <p> " Your early works ? " At least , Sanger was paying attention . <p> " In my current writing I denounce C-K in terms which are accessible to prisoners of the C-K mindset . They run things now ; that 's the political reality . I do n't see much purpose in addressing myself to those like us , who have evaded treatment . After all , we 're the smallest of minorities , spread over a handful of isolated farms . " Chester was simply unwilling to let Sanger cast him in the role of a defeated old man , however near it was to the truth . He 'd hint at a few mysteries of his own instead . Even though there was no current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Sanger . " I see we are pointed in the same direction , as we are in this vehicle . When the metaphorical and the literal coincide , the presence of the All is confirmed . Let them banish us to the farm ; residing there is a single answer , which by satisfying our two questions will reveal them to be one . " <p> " Where ? " asked Welch . " In the library ? " <p> " No , Roberta , not in the library . " <p> Chester groaned to himself . The wipers slapped a numbing rhythm as the van hummed along . They passed a hundred year old white farmhouse , a red barn , an apple orchard , rows of trees losing their leaves to the autumn downpour . <p> " No , Roberta , " Sanger blathered on , " in this instance the literal is contradicted ; libraries are behind us , as are conference calls , satellite feeds , federal indictments  --  the detritus we are sloughing off as we move to a new life on your farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the storm going in the opposite direction , trailing a wet cloud behind it . Water spattered the windshield and for a few seconds the world was smudged and gray . <p> " Like a comet , " said Sanger . " That 's exactly the image I was seeking . We hurtle away from the past , Chester and I , sluicing off layers of an old life . " <p> Chester could n't resist . " But that 's wrong . A comet 's tail is formed by pressure from something ahead of it ; it 's not a trail left by rapid forward motion . It 's not the result of progress but of resistance to progress . " <p> " Splendid ! " said Sanger . " Of course I 'm wrong ! You 've defined the difference between us and the sheep that surround us , with their boosted neurotransmitters and squashed spirits . We still have the freedom to err . " <p> " Splendid , " muttered Chester . " Though I do hope , Mr. Sanger , that fallibility is n't our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must call me Brother Emil . " <p> The van slowed as Welch pulled up before a low , flat-roofed brick building with wide eaves . The Corley Mitchell Cooperative Accommodation Farm . She parked at the entrance and shut off the motor . <p> " Mr. Drummond , Brother Emil  --  welcome to your new home , " she said , turning back across the seat to smile at them . At that moment Chester felt an odd and disconcerting impulse to touch the curve of her neck . " I hope you 'll be happy here . " <p> 2 . Their rooms were in a wing that culminated in a bright common area furnished with a telewall , two couches , datadesks and chairs , and a refrigerator filled with whole grain snacks which , when Chester sampled them later , tasted like they had been recycled from old encyclopedias . The private rooms themselves were spare , and restful . <p> Chester unpacked his clothes and hung them in the small closet , unpacked his three books and put them on the shelf above his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Devil 's Dictionary . For one bookend he used the brake piston of the 1974 Honda that he had kept as an ashtray since he was nineteen . At the other end he carefully set the bronze bust of Plato , packed with enough superdense plastique to bring down a small skyscraper . The quote engraved on its base read : " No evil can happen to a good man , either in life or after death . " His staff had given him the bust during the campaign of 2016 ; the explosives had come much later . <p> He 'd given the major parties a run for their money in that election , taking five states and 96 electoral votes . Given the growth curve of the Valutarian Party , he knew he 'd win in 2020 . People had been hungry for his message . They 'd suffered enough from the aftereffects of the pre-millennial irresponsibility , the dismal legacy of the late-20th century 's complete abandonment of facts . Even as a young man Chester had seen the inevitable chaos that would come from the pernicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " constructed " from language and that science was no more real than wishing . Chester believed in science . <p> The economic shocks of the first decade had shaken the foolishness out of the people , sent them flocking to the Valutarian Party . He had predicted his own success , seen the rising arc of his career clear as the flight of a fourth-of-July rocket : the crowds , the TV lights , the women , the successful books , his failing marriage , the electoral triumphs . <p> The only thing he had not for seem was the Carcopino-Koster boost . Chester was alone in his room for a whole quarter hour before Sanger appeared in his doorway . " You must be wondering what I was alluding to in the van , " Sanger said slyly . <p> Chester was in no mood to be polite . " I 've been wondering what you were alluding to for the length of your public career , " he said . " I consider every word out of your mouth to be obtuse , mystical bullshit . Metaphors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this comes as a surprise , Brother Emil . " <p> Sanger only smiled . " I 'm offering to lift the veil in this instance , Chester . " <p> " Go ahead . " <p> " There 's a woman here named Elizabeth Wiley . I 've been seeking her for nearly two years , and with the help of the All I 've found her . She 's masquerading as another holdout , just like the rest of us , but she 's different . She 's merely the most important woman in the world . " <p> I guess that leaves room for one of us to be the most important man , Chester thought irritably . <p> " She underwent Carcopino-Koster ten years ago , " continued Sanger , and suddenly Chester 's attention was riveted . " A year and a half ago she was assigned to this farm , and not mistakenly . She 's the Grail . A returner . " " That 's impossible . C-K is irreversible . " <p> Sanger came in and sat down on Chester 's bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri Botanical Gardens . Carcopino changed little in her life ; she was a loving wife and mother , by all accounts contented , unremarkable . Two years ago she and her husband were on a foliage tour in New Hampshire ; a tire blew and their bus skidded off the highway . Her husband was killed instantly . Elizabeth sustained massive head injuries , went into a coma . When she regained consciousness her personality had reverted to its pre-Carcopino formation . " <p> " How do you know all of this ? " <p> " My sources are my own . But Chester , the miracle of her reversion is not the most interesting part of Elizabeth 's story . What compels me is this : when the doctors explained the situation to her , she refused another boost . She compared the two states , and declined Carcopino-Koster ! " <p> Chester could already see five different slants for the propaganda campaign . Six , because the fact that there had been no press on this meant there had been cover-up of staggering dimensions . A laugh of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in years . <p> " Yes ! " Sanger laughed with him . " You see the true import of Sister Elizabeth ; I can tell . Her potential to serve the All is limitless . " <p> When did she become Sister Elizabeth ? Chester wondered . And how could exposing government conspiracy benefit the All ? Chester resented the speed with which Sanger appropriated people and ideas to his absurd cause . " Gentlemen , " said Roberta Welch . " It 's time for dinner . " <p> They looked up , startled . How long had she been standing in the doorway ? How much had she heard ? <p> 3 . The refectory was a brightly lit , lemon yellow room on the south side of the building . Most of the food , Roberta Welch told them , was grown on the farm and prepared by their fellow refuseniks . Everyone stood when Welch ushered Chester and Sanger into the room . Chester was pleased that most of the holdouts knew who he was , although he had n't experienced his celebrity in so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galled him that they seemed much more shocked to see Sanger reduced to seeking refuge on an accommodation farm . <p> Many of the refuseniks were old , though in most cases gerontological advances had kept them looking fit , closer to forty than seventy . Some were legitimately younger  --  you could tell by the hands . Chester , engaging a politician 's reflexes , memorized names and faces . <p> They met Nicholas Koundis , a doddering old Christian Scientist who could no longer remember how old he was or exactly who he had been . " Come to die unmuddled with , eh ? " he asked them . " Good for you . Welcome aboard . " <p> They met Gail Wood , a cheerfully dim woman who wanted to talk to them about the Red Sox . " The ' 18 series does n't count , " she said . " Until they win it without the help of C-K , they have n't proven anything , the curse of the Bambino is intact . I 'm holding on till that day comes . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said : " I predicted this , all of it . Everything I predicted came true . But my books never sold . " <p> They met Leon Proudline , no older than thirty , who sat huddled in a corner chanting " Fuckshitpenis , fuckshitpenis , fuckshitpenis , " in a Buddhist monotone . <p> They met Darla Coy , who was waiting for Elvis . <p> They met Colin Hammel , Linda Bartly , Ebb Gonzales and John Whreg . Phil Dietrich and Joane Boyle popped out of the kitchen , wiping wet hands on white aprons . All of the refuseniks possessed belief systems that had kept them at the margins of society . Unwilling or unable to compete economically with the emotionally stabilized , intellectually enhanced C-K population , they were now exhibits in a museum of the human psyche . <p> If I am to resurrect my movement , Chester realized , my first followers will come from among these . No doubt Sanger was thinking the same thing , but Sanger 's prospects seemed distinctly brighter . It was easier , certainly , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to political consciousness . <p> " This is Dwight Greenberg , " said Welch . " He 's a psychology major at SUNY Binghampton who 's my intern for a semester . " Chester was not impressed ; the C-K boost had done nothing for the college kid 's complexion . <p> Then , as though she 'd known to save her for last , Welch steered them to a table in the comer of the dining hall , where a black woman waited alone . Elizabeth Wiley looked like someone who had suddenly shed a lot of weight . Her smooth face was hollow and the skin hung loosely from her arms . She seemed lost in the uniform green jeans the refuseniks all wore . <p> " Bet , " said Roberta Welch solemnly , " this is Emil Sanger and Chester Drummond . " She nodded at each in turn . " Gentlemen , Bet Wiley . " <p> Elizabeth Wiley reached out with both hands and took one of each of theirs . She had a cloudy , preoccupied expression , as if she were already carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chester are joining the farm , " said Roberta Welch . <p> Bet Wiley peered in turn at each of the two hands she held , shifting them slightly , like prisms that might suddenly reveal a new dimension . Her touch was warm and firm . <p> " Oh , yes , " she said , and smiled . " I recognize you now . She told me you were coming last week . " <p> Chester protested , " But she did n't know . I was n't taken off the street until Monday night . " <p> " She does n't mean that I told her , " said Roberta Welch . " Bet is in communication with the Virgin Mary . " <p> Sanger was suddenly excited . " You talk to her ? This is better than I had hoped . " He turned to Chester . " The Virgin Mary is one of the most frequent identifications given the All over the course of history . " <p> But Elizabeth Wiley was shaking her head . " Oh , no . What could I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me messages in the veins of leaves . She whispers in the wind . " <p> Sanger smoothed the conversation back to his advantage . " Yes , Sister Bet , of course , " he said . " The divine always seeks new souls to touch . God loves us . I believe we 're going to be dear friends . " <p> " Oh , yes . " She pulled their hands toward her . " It is here , in your fingerprints . " Suddenly Chester and Sanger were touching . " You 're to be great allies . The very best of friends . " Too late , Chester jerked his hand away . <p> " What ? " It was Sanger 's turn to be confused . " No , I meant us . You and I , Sister . " <p> Bet wrinkled her cheeks in a smile . " If you like . " <p> Chester could feel Welch watching them . She must have recognized the danger Elizabeth Wiley posed to the boosted world . Yes , the old woman had some rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could n't understand why she was n't being held someplace more secure than the Corley Mitchell Accommodation Farm . Here he was , the founder of the Valutarian Party , ready and able to exploit this woman 's genuine subversive potential , and so far the only person in his way was Roberta Welch . It was the neverending arrogance of C-K . Welch was less than half his age , and her intelligence , no matter how enhanced , was no match for his experience . <p> " Your dinner , " Phil Dietrich announced , " requests that you eat it . " <p> 4 . The next afternoon , as he jogged around the grounds of the accommodation farm plotting revolution , Chester came upon Roberta Welch working at a stuck pump at the fish pond . She sat crosslegged on the ground , wearing dark green coveralls . There was a line between her brows as she studied a schematic of the pump unfolded across one thigh , while in her muddy hand she held a large chrome allen wrench . Her dark hair , combed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side and fell over her cheek . <p> He felt an unexpected mix of sympathy and disapproval . " Ca n't the staff handle repairs ? " he asked . <p> Her mind was somewhere in the intricacies of the pump , and she did not look up right away . When she did she slowly smiled . <p> " Dwight had to go into town to buy some ready mix concrete . I like to work with my hands . " <p> " What about your sense of dignity ? Do you think your staff should see you like this ? " <p> A misstep . She gave him a look that he had come to recognize all too well : the silent sigh of the C-K adjusted when facing an unregenerate human being . " Do n't bother , " Chester said . " I should have known better than to ask that . " <p> She laughed . " Thanks . There are about four assumptions in there that I 'd have to explain before I could make you understand . But there is no staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we 're just here to help out . " <p> He sat on the ground next to her . His joints were still pretty flexible for a sixty-year-old 's , but then he 'd been taking juvenation drugs for twenty years . " You know , I 'm really not as unreasonable as the civics made me out tO be . " <p> She inserted the allen wrench into an aperture in the centrifugal pump and tried to turn it . It did n't budge . " I 've never thought you were unreasonable . Too reasonable , if anything . " <p> " Let me try that . " <p> She let him take the wrench . " Something 's jamming it . Do n't force it too much , you could damage the mechanism . " <p> He put his shoulders into it , and after a moment the impeller broke loose . He almost fell over with the release of resistance . She caught him ; her face close to his . <p> " Are you all right ? " she asked . <p> Her breath was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her chest and his breath caught in his throat . He gave an embarrassed cough and drew slowly away . " Nothing like a little brute strength with machinery . " <p> " Let 's try it out , " she said . She reinserted the fuses into the switchbox and turned on the pump . It whined into life and water gushed out into the pool . " Thanks , " she said . <p> " Any time . " <p> Welch glanced over at the barn , as if looking for a way out of the conversation . Had she felt something too ? " Do n't forget you 're scheduled for your first group therapy session today . " <p> " I do n't need therapy , Roberta . I 'm a political prisoner . " " You 're not a prisoner , Mr. Drummond . " " Chester . " <p> " Therapy is optional , Chester . " She packed up her tool box , professionally distant . " Not everybody takes part . " <p> " Who does ? " <p> " It changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Gail Wood , Linda Bartley . Emil Sanger said he 'd come . And Bet Wiley . " <p> She 'd said the magic words . He sighed , and said : " When do we start ? " <p> 5 . Chester stood in the shower , recalling the feeling of being with a woman . It had been a long time . He wondered what Roberta Welch made of him , if she could tell that he was not just another lunatic . There was no point denying the electricity of her touch . When the time for action came , he hoped he would not have to hurt her . <p> He could not believe that there were only two of them : a woman and a boy . A small group with a weapon and the will power could take over the Corley Mitchell Accommodation Farm in a matter of minutes . Stepping out of the shower , Chester glanced at his ace in the hole : the bust of Plato , with its payload of plastique . The bomb had been his security chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow up Valutarian Party headquaters back in 2023 and then blame the government for trying to assassinate Chester . Korsakov had been a little crazy , even for an ex-KGB , but at least he had believed . Recently , even Chester 's belief had flagged . On the train out to the farm , he had considered taking Plato for a walk to some nice secluded spot and blowing himself from the shadowy cave of life into the eternal world of forms . But now Bet Wiley had given him reason to live . <p> Unlike Korsakov , Chester was not a man of action , but he believed he could manage this little uprising . He 'd need help : Fence and John Whreg seemed likely recruits , maybe he could even co-opt Brother Emil . If he could n't win Bet Wiley over , they 'd just take her hostage . All they really needed was her story , not her cooperation . Hole up in some barn with the bomb and invite the cameras to his very own media circus . He would be a colossus astride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the power of his voice . <p> On arriving at the lounge , he saw Brother Emil Sanger already seated at the far end of the circle of chairs . He assumed the prophet was there for the same reason he was  --  to get closer to Elizabeth Wiley . <p> Roberta opened the session by focussing immediately on the new arrivals . " Let 's start with you , Brother Emil , " she said . " You were saying this morning that you wanted to be cured . " <p> " Cured , yes , " said Brother Emil . " Of the coercion of the state . Of the tyranny of reason . " <p> Roberta raised her eyebrows expectantly . <p> Allan Fence , the writer , quickly rose to the occasion . " What coercion ? " he said . " You checked yourself in here voluntarily , Brother Emil . Of your own free will . " <p> " When we were neanderthals , " replied Brother Emil , " we developed a taste for mastodon . You know how we hunted them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive the herd toward the edge of a cliff . Within the bounds of that line each mastodon exercised free will , yet today "  --  he waved at the window , which looked out over the fields  --  " one very rarely sees a mastodon . " <p> " No , no , that 's terribly wrong . " Linda Bartly was upset . " We 're not all mastodons , we 're not all the same . They 're like a hunting line , but what they 've crowded together is a flock of creatures : sloths , butterflies , leopards , loons , platypuses  --  " <p> Loons indeed , thought Chester . <p> "  --  they want us all to be the same , but we 're not  --  " <p> " Linda , " said Roberta , " would you like to tell the group what you see in Brother Emil and Chester 's auras ? " She turned and explained to Chester : " Linda sees auras . But not around those of us who 've undergone Carcopino . We 've lost ours . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will avail us nothing to become mastodons , certainly . But if we all grew wings together , the onrushing cliff would become an opportunity . " <p> " Or arm the mastodons with machine guns , " said Allan Fence thoughtfully . " Suitably adapted for physiological differences , of course . Trunk triggered , air-cooled fifty calibers with cermet stocks . " <p> " Mr. Drummond 's aura is huge , " Linda Bartly stage-whispered . " Big enough for all of us . But it 's gray  --  " <p> " I 'm interested in what the group thinks of Brother Emil 's image of the wings , " said Roberta . " Implicitly , he 's proposing to lead you , to turn you into his followers . He 's not a man who gives up easily  --  only last year he was preaching the end of the world to his cult on Mt . Shasta . " <p> " It was postponed , " said Sanger . <p> " Your following has evaporated since then . Is that the reason you 're here ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always seek the answers . Others are welcome to join me in that seeking . " <p> " It was postponed , " said Bet Wiley . She was knitting , leaning back in her chair , unhurriedly clacking the brass needles , between which hung a tiny scrap of finished work . <p> There was a silence . It was more than Brother Emil shutting up and staring . Everyone seemed to hang on Bet 's words . <p> " It was postponed , " she said again , and shook her head a little . " But now it 'll come . She has come back for the stragglers , the lost sheep . " <p> " I 'm sorry , Bet , " said Roberta , " can you explain ? " <p> Bet Wiley tilted her head . " She says I 'm to be the very last . Just look at the way the chairs are arranged in this room , and you 'll see it 's so . Who 's sitting where . " Then she turned to Chester . " She tells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent you a message about Chester Drummond ? " asked Allan Fence . " You know , I wrote that story once , only it was Joan of Arc and Hitler . " <p> " What brings you to us , Chester ? " said Gall Wood , the Red Sox fan . Chester glared at her . <p> " You should share with the group , " said Roberta . " You agreed to cooperate . " <p> " I did not , " said Chester . " Just because I 've been forced to seek shelter from your sterile C-K society does n't mean I have to answer questions . This is n't a prison , it 's an accommodation farm . Was n't that what you said earlier ? " <p> " You think today 's society is sterile ? I find it closer to utopia than the world your generation left us . " <p> " If it were anyone else besides these condescending , all-forgiving Carcopino clones that had taken away your power , " said Allan Fence , " you 'd probably have been executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Chester said . " At least it would have been a man 's death , a leader 's death . " <p> " When you accept Carcopino-Koster treatment , " said Roberta , " you 'll understand how little difference there is between the leader of a movement and one of that movement 's followers . We 've no more to hold against you than we would against someone you 'd led around by the nose  --  you 're both victims of a delusive belief system . " <p> " In a parade going nowhere , " said Allan Fence , " it does n't matter if you 're standing in the front . " <p> " I was a Valutarian , " said Gail Wood . " I voted for you . Sent you money . ' Chester Drummond , he remembers the values of America . ' " <p> Chester was jolted by the slogan . He had heard it through amplifiers in crowded convention halls , seen it scroll across window shirts across the land . Now hearing it spoken here at a roundtable of idiots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal America . <p> " Read your newsletter right up to the end , " she continued reflectively . " Lifetime subscriber . Never thought I 'd meet you , though . " <p> " At the end , " said Bet Wiley , " the universe shrinks to one point , and all that is scattered is collected together . " <p> " Yes , " said Brother Emil . " The All is here with us in this room . " He leaned forward , excessively pleased . <p> " Your aura , " said Linda Bartly , staring at Brother Emil . " It 's flaring yellow , like a beacon of hope in the night . " <p> " It 's not night , " Allan Fence pointed out . " It 's one-twenty in the afternoon . " <p> " The gray one , " said Linda Bartly , indicating Chester . " He 's enclosing us in his world . " <p> " The melancholic temperament has an allure , " said Roberta . " Until Carcopino , it was widely seen as a prerequisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary is actually true . " <p> " Tell that to Lincoln , " said Chester . <p> " Or Beethoven , or Malzberg , " said Allan Fence , with a vinegar laugh . " The C-K society is hardly lacking for philosophers or artists , " said Roberta . " You know that as well as I do . They 're simply free of the psychological turbulence , the displaced intensities , that distort your intellect . " <p> " Turbulence , " said Brother Emil . " That 's one word for what 's missing from your utopia . Others are passion , genius , that unpredictable spark that furthers the All . Your churches are empty , your familial bonds have been reduced to economic contracts . The graveyards go unvisited because the dead are forgotten . This is a world fit only to end . " <p> " Everything I said about the depressive tendency applies equally to the manic , " said Roberta . <p> " Let them dance , " said Bet Wiley , and again the room fell silent around her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dance ? " said Gail Wood finally . <p> " Our new friends , " said Bet . " They dance like my needles here . Call it manic and depressive if you like . The Virgin knows the truth . " <p> It seemed impossible , but it struck Chester that even Roberta treated Bet Wiley as the leader of the group . <p> " If it will bring the end She desires , " Bet continued , " let them dance the last dance . " <p> 6 . There were perhaps thirty hardcopy books in the farm 's library room , which was across the hall from Roberta 's office . But Chester was not looking for books . He used the datagate to retrieve the architect 's plans for the cooperative , and downloaded them into a secure file in his journal , called " Magus . " <p> Over the past few weeks , as he learned his way around the farm , parts of the plan had come clear . The farm kept chickens , a few cows for milk , and six vats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash crops grew in two hydroponic greenhouses , buried in the earth for insulation . From a distance their flat transparent krylac roofs made them look like plastic lakes . Greenhouse #1 was filled with long season crops : tomatoes , eggplant , okra , celery and melons . Greenhouse #2 supplied leafy vegetables : lettuce , chard , pak choi , kale , and cabbage . Labor-intensive fresh produce grown year-round for the restaurant and gourmet grocery trade ; the Corley Mitchell Accommodation Farm actually turned a slight profit for the C-K state . <p> The underground utility room which housed the hydroponic recirculators and greenhouse heating system was virtually impregnable . From it he could emerge to grant interviews , with ranks of swiss chard as a reassuring backdrop . <p> Bet Wiley was group leader for Greenhouse #2 . Chester eagerly volunteered to work there , hoping to discover some way to bend her to his purposes . Brother Emil chose her group as well , no doubt for the same reason . However , as the weeks wore on , each discovered that she was as dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . She had little time for idle chatter . When she spoke at all , it was usually to the plants . Chester tried endlessly to draw her out about the accident , C-K politics , why she had become a refusenik . She was as slippery as a melon seed . At least Brother Emil was being similarly frustrated . Often as not , the two of them ended up trying to convert one another . <p> Bet 's volunteers spent five hours a day in the greenhouse , monitoring the nutrient solution , staking climbers , moving seedling flats , cornposting spent plants . Their most arduous task was hand-picking a maddening variety of pests off the plants : white flies and spider mites and mealy bugs and scale . The irony of this task was not lost on Chester . Just as he plucked offending aphids from the backs of lettuce leaves , so had the civics removed him from the alleys of Manhattan . When he shared this observation with Brother Emil that day , Bet chanced to overhear . <p> " But you were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where you belong . This is what She wanted . " Her gesture encompassed the three of them . " You both working together . Working with me for Her . " <p> " Mrs. Wiley , " said Chester , " I wonder how much you know about the two of us , about the different nature of our respective pursuits . " <p> Bet shook her head . " She has told me more about you than you ever could . " <p> " But  --  " <p> " You both grew up knowing that the world you were bom into must end , " she said . She tumed to Chester  --  " For you it was a somber realization , "  --  and then to Brother Emil  --  " For you , ecstatic revelation . But it was the same thing . And you 're both afraid you failed . She knows , so I know . " <p> " This mirrors my current thinking exactly , " said Brother Emil excitedly . " It occurred to me in group : by claiming to resolve both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and the same . " <p> " I do n't for a minute grant your point . " <p> " Look at it this way , " said Sanger . " Is n't all visionary political thinking , like yours , ultimately utopian ? By definition ? " <p> " Possibly . " <p> " And is n't a utopian state one where communion between different men , and different nations , is so complete that it becomes a state of spiritual  --  apotheosis ? " <p> " An ideal politics might send me groping for metaphors like ' communion , ' and ' spiritual , ' and ' apotheosis , ' but they would still be metaphors , employed in describing a thing that would still be politics . " <p> " Wait , listen : in a politically achieved utopia , would n't each individual be free from political concems , class questions , questions of survival and economics ? " <p> " I expect so . " Chester noticed that Bet had slipped away . <p> " Free , therefore , to concentrate on questions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " If the individual in question so desired , " he grumbled . <p> Brother Emil grew more excited . " Listen , Chester . Is n't that precisely the deficiency you sense in the Carcopino state ? They claim it as a utopia , yet the individuals are all bright surface , without depth , like energetic children ! Having made the world one state under Carcopino , they should be struggling with new levels of meaning , new emancipations . Instead , they appear completely lacking in breadth , completely numbed to any sense of the great human cause , of tragic profundity , the great story . " <p> Chester was silent . <p> " The only utopia is heaven , " said Bet Wiley , passing by with a flat of kale seedlings . " And She says heaven is nothing more than true freedom . " <p> At that moment they were interrupted by the appearance of a group of school children , led by Dwight . Chester stiffened ; it was the first group of C-K tourists he had seen at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen  --  stepped forward , his expression bright and attentive . " Please go on with what you were saying , " he said , and then smiled encouragingly at Bet , Chester and Brother Emil . " I was interested in hearing your thoughts on freedom . " <p> As he looked at the boy 's open face it came to Chester with renewed force how few they were , how large the C-K society , how formidable were the forces arrayed against his retum to power . This boy probably could n't remember a time before the boost . Chester felt swirling up out of him a despair as black as any he 'd ever known . <p> " My thoughts on freedom are in the public record , " he said to the boy , and turned and strode quickly out of the greenhouse . <p> 7 . After stalking around the grounds in a black rage for twenty minutes , he found himself at the end of the drive . The highway stretched east and west like an invitation . He was n't a prisoner ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could happen was that some civic would pick him up , feed him supper and call the farm . But which direction should he pick ? East , back to Farron 's Landing and the train ? <p> To the west , the road curved off into the trees . The air had a late-fall bite to it , a hint of the winter just around the comer . West was America 's direction , the bearing of manifest destiny . It beckoned . <p> The road to manifest destiny was , however , falling apart . The C-K state had over-regulated the private automobile to the point of extinction . The vast amounts of money that for the better part of a century had been expended on making and maintaining roads were being spent elsewhere . <p> A couple of miles down the road he came upon a farm house . White frame , at least a hundred years old . On the roof a satellite dish the size of a wok listened silently to the southern sky . In the yard was a tangle of aluminum siding that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a blue tarp , was a stack of clapboards in twenty foot lengths . Something he had overheard at the center sparked in his memory : Roberta telling Darla Coy that she was restoring an early twentieth century house . <p> He tried the side door and found it unlocked . A large butcher block table , scarred and darkened from years of use , dominated the kitchen . It seemed somehow barbaric . Roberta managed to live without a dishwasher , microwave or hydratot . The breakfast dishes were neatly aligned in the drying rack by the sink . One bowl , one spoon , one coffee cup . <p> Her office was upstairs . In one comer was her personal datagate , the latest from Cognico . There was also a flowered futon and a charmingly anachronistic metal filing cabinet . The walls were plastered with dozens of stickers for long departed pre-millennial political organizations : Amnesty International , National Rifle Association , Gays for God , The Alphysics Movement , InfoMass , Mothers Against Drunk Driving , the Moral Majority . The names stirred a cloud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had belonged to ; others he had fought . <p> She found him half an hour later standing by the filing cabinet , a folder with his name on it opened flat on top of the shelf of other folders , leating through clippings , faxes , photographs , and half a dozen disks in plastic folders , each labeled in her small handwriting : " Journal  --  Early Life , " " Journal  --  Political Career , " " Joumal  --  Relationships . " <p> " Here you are , " she said . <p> He did n't bother to look at her . " You broke into my journal . " <p> " Yes . " She settled herself on the futon . " It reads as if you intended it for an audience . You have some amazing insights , Chester . Your analysis of the campaign of ' 16 is the best I 've ever read . " <p> He considered . " You expect me to be flattered ? " <p> " Maybe you should be . " She gestured at the stickers on the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm interested in your career , Chester . " <p> A hobby , he thought . Like fly-fishin , stamp collecting . He closed the folder and put it back in the cabinet . " There are lots of files in here . I 'm just one of your interests . " <p> " You 're a distinct individual . " <p> " Chester Drummond . Your patient . " <p> " Chester Drummond , hunter for secrets . Believer in truth . " He could not tell how much of her voice was mockery . It did n't sound like mockery . " Leader of men . Last of the pre-millennial giants . " <p> " And I 'm fascinating , right ? You 're impressed by me , but then you 're impressed by Emil . Bet . Allan Fence . " He searched her brown eyes for some sign that she thought he was different from the rest . The light was failing and the room was heavy with shadows . She gave him nothing and he turned his back to her , feeling old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands on his shoulders . She slid them down his back , around his waist , and pressed herself against him . He could not have been more surprised had she pulled a gun on him . <p> He laughed , a choked laugh . She rested her head on his shoulder blade . She slid her slender fingers between the buttons of his shirt , touching the gray hair of his chest . Her hands were warm in the chill of the room . Unbelieving , he turned around . <p> She drew him toward the futon , and for a brief time he stopped asking himself questions , as surely as if he had C-K 'd himself into equanimity , while her pale body moved through the gray dusk against his aging one . <p> When he awoke he found she had covered him with a quilt . It was night and a Halloween moon threw a wedge of silver light across the comer of the futon . Roberta was sitting in front of her datagate , another quilt wrapped around her body . Her dark hair tumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred unnameable emotions in him . For the first time since he 'd gotten on the train in New York , he felt more calm than angry . <p> " What did this mean ? " he asked . <p> " Did you enjoy it ? " She did not look away from the screen . <p> " Of course . Did n't you ? " <p> " Oh , yes , certainly . So why does it have to mean anything ? " <p> " Because we have some kind of relationship . Doctor-patient , jailer-prisoner  --  I do n't know exactly . We work together , maybe we 're even friends . This changes things . " <p> " No , it does n't . " Finally she turned to face him . " You needed something I had to give , that 's all . It 's amazing how a little serotonin boost can change your outlook on life . " <p> Chester sat up , reaching for his clothes . " You 're saying this was behavior modification ? " <p> " Do n't get me wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your rebelliousness , egocentricity , radical self-confidence  --  they 're qualities that should make you a valued member of society . " <p> " They did , at one time , " Chester said , calmer than he felt . " In case you 've forgotten . " <p> " I have n't . But there 's no reason you should n't find a place in the world now . I heard you got upset when the latest school field trip came through this afternoon . Fine . So why shut yourself up in this museum ? " <p> " Were you this much of a manipulative bitch before you were C-K treated ? " <p> " I was very young . I do n't remember . " <p> Chester pulled on his pants . He had a knot in his back from the futon . <p> " You know , there 's nothing you can do to change the world , " Roberta said . She reached behind her without looking and shut off the gate . " You did n't change it as much as you thought you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your own inadequacies through denial and projection . You were a dangerous man , a trigger waiting to be pulled to set off the millions of similarly warped and frustrated people around you . Until they all changed , and you were left alone . " <p> " I 'm not alone here . " <p> " Right . The others at the Mitchell center are like you . But I do n't think there 's enough explosive material in them for you to make much of a blast . " <p> She rose from her chair , pulled the quilt around her and came to him . She touched his cheek . " And you do n't have to be alone , you know . " <p> Chester pushed her hand away , pulled on his shoes and left . <p> * * *8 . Chester ate dinner alone , late , sulking . For some reason he could n't stop thinking about Charlotte , his first wife . They had been very young , both of them law students at Duke , when they 'd married . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few blocks from the campus . Charlotte was scared of insects , and when the weather turned cool the large roaches that bred outside in the leaf mold would come into the house in search of food at night . Charlotte would walk into the kitchen , flip on the light and spot one crawling up the face of the kitchen cabinet , or in the silverware drawer . She invariably screamed , but she did n't allow him to use insect spray , and she did n't want to crush them . Neither did he  --  though he would n't admit it , he was hardly less squeamish  --  so they kept a plastic cup and a piece of cardboard on the bookshelf . Chester would trap the roach under the cup , slide the sheet of cardboard under the cup and carry the roach to the bathroom and flush it down the toilet . <p> After a while , whenever he heard Charlotte 's shriek from another room , he knew that it was time for him to fetch the cup and go roach hunting . The ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imperfect nature of the world , and the way they coped with it without betraying their sensibilities , was a textbook example of politics at work . It bound them together . <p> Not so firmly , of course , that it kept them bound when the marriage went sour . A politics sufficient to the dispatching of roaches had n't carried them very far in the end . <p> In a black mood , feeling all his life behind , nothing left ahead of him , Chester was drawn to Bet Wiley 's room . She sat knitting , her chair turned toward the door , as though she were expecting him . There was a portrait of the Virgin hanging over the bed . <p> " Ah , Chester . Sit down . " <p> He sat . Her attitude of knowing that he was going to arrive only irritated him . " Why are you always knitting ? You 're a little old to be expecting a baby . " <p> " There are all kinds of babies . " <p> He let that pass . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My daughter Reshonda is a hospital dietician in Rochester . Roger , my son , was studying law before he was C-K boosted . Now he 's a landscape architect . " <p> " Grandchildren ? " <p> She shook her head . The clack of her needles filled a long silence . She was waiting for something from him . <p> " What are you making ? " <p> She fanned the stitches out along the needles to keep them from falling off and then held up what was obviously a sweater . " I started back in March . " She came out of her chair , pressed it to his shoulders and nodded in satisfaction . " For you . " <p> " For me ? " <p> " She told me you would come and take over here . " <p> " What do you mean , take over ? " <p> " It 's time for me to move on to another farm . " <p> " Move on ? I do n't understand . " His brain was like mud . " Were you-aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She told me what I need to know . It has nothing to do with your previous work . That has come to an end ; you must start over now . She told me you would help me complete my mission here . You and Emil . " <p> Chester started to speak , then stopped . <p> " You feel very alone , " said Bet . " I  --  yes , I do . " <p> " The people who seem to want to listen , the people who care ; me , Emil , the others  --  you think we 're crazy . " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " Soon this will be over . " <p> " How ? " <p> " One way or another . You will join us and know you are whole , or you will be left alone to find the martyrdom you seek . The time of hesitation is nearly done . " <p> " I do n't seek martyrdom . " <p> " No . You seek release . " <p> Chester lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tears . <p> Bet looked up , but her needles clacked on . " Emil is coming here tonight too . He needs to talk . " <p> " I can leave . " <p> " No . I want you to hear . But be out of sight . " She nodded at the closet door . " Hurry . " <p> He hesitated . <p> " Go . " She waved the sweater at him . " Inside . " <p> Amazed , Chester stumbled up and into Bet Wiley 's closet . He closed the door to just a crack , and the closet light shut off automatically . <p> In the dark he wiped his teary cheek and leaned back against Bet 's hanging clothes , and wondered how it had come to this . He might have been about to protest the indignity when there came the sound of Emil 's voice . <p> " Sister Bet . I wonder if I might have a word with you . " <p> " Sit down , Emil . " <p> " I tried to find Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bet . " She would like us to further our understanding together . Then we can approach the others . " <p> " Yes , fine . " Chester could hear Emil 's sincere excitement . " But we should draw on our collective energy soon . The group here has the potential to function as a cell , a psychic battery . " <p> " Yes . " Bet 's needles ticked away , and Chester imagined he could hear her nodding . <p> " I imagine nothing less than that we would sequester together , barricade ourselves against the staff , against the entire Carcopino reality , and together foment the end of the world ! " <p> " Yes , that is very much like what She has in mind for us . " <p> " Really ? She has spoken of this ? " <p> " She sent me here to make this happen . And it is close , it is much closer than you think . " <p> " I am beside myself , Sister Bet . " <p> " You are . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to yourself , be no longer beside . For that is where the world resides . The world that must end . " <p> " I do n't understand . " <p> " How could you ? You are beside yourself . We all are . I only know because She tells me . " <p> " Tell me what She said about me . " The certainty had gone out of Emil 's voice now . <p> There followed a pause where even Bet 's needles were silent . Chester wanted to widen the crack in the door and peek out , but he knew the closet light would flash on automatically , giving him away . Maybe if he loosened the bulb in its socket  --  <p> Bet Wiley began , bringing the words up like water from a deep , forgotten well . " The world you live in , the only world that exists for you , is the world of your reception in the souls of other people . You 've lived there all your life . <p> " Now it has narrowed . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around you . Those who have taken Carcopino are deaf to your passion . In them , your world is dead . Your world is here , down to these last few who might still hear you . " <p> " You mean the farm ? " Sanger whispered . <p> " Join me in bringing these last sheep into the pasture , Emil . Then you 'll have the end of your world . Then renewal can begin , God bless . " <p> " My message , " protested Sanger . " The All  --  " <p> " She says you lived and breathed your message into the fiber of the world . Now comes the forgiving , the forgetting . The treatment is making the world a clean slate , and the seeds you planted with your works will arise or they are not meant to . But first the job must be finished . Your world must end , just as you 've always promised . You too must cross to the other side , where the C-K souls await you . There you will find your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , in the world after your world . " <p> " Can it be ? " <p> " You were sent to me to help me finish my work , Emil . She sent me back to gather the strays , and she sent you to help me . The others here need you . " <p> " Incredible . And she says my works will flourish , in the future ? " <p> " If the Carcopino world needs your message , it will find it . The same is true for Chester . The time for passionate embodiment of your works is over . Now you must move on to that bright new world yourself . But first help me bring this last tattered remnant of the old world home . You are not the only one who needs convincing , Emil . Use the power of your voice , your vision . " <p> " But there are other farms . Other handfuls of refuseniks  --  " <p> " She has provided . Soon , you and Chester will lead this farm to the C-K treatments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving on to another facility , where my work may continue , Her will be done . " <p> " You 're like Moses , " said Emil wonderingly . " You 'll lead your people to the promised land , though you may not get there yourself . " <p> " Do n't worry about me . I 've had the healing once . " <p> " You 're beautiful , Sister Bet . You have the radiance of the truth . May I  --  may I kiss your hand ? " <p> " It is Her work that is beautiful . You might as well kiss the leaves in the greenhouse . " <p> " Nonetheless  --  " <p> Chester heard him kneel and smack his lips . <p> " I 'm going to find Chester , " Emil announced , his brightness recovered . " He 'll be my first convert . A hard nut to crack , but if it 's Her will . . . " <p> " No , " said Bet . " You must n't speak to Chester as you have been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stray for you to tend , like the others . The Virgin picked him out to do her work , sooner or later ; he is another leader , like you , and he will join us in our work , or find his own way . But he is not to be bothered . " <p> " What if he does n't see ? " <p> " If he refuses treatment , he and I will be transferred together . Leave him to Her gentle hand . Go to the others . " <p> " Yes , sister . " <p> And at that , Emil hurried away . <p> Chester emerged from the closet . Bet was knitting , and singing sound-lessly to herself . He stood before her . <p> Her eyes met his briefly , then fell . Clack , cIack . <p> He left without saying anything . <p> 9 . He locked the door to his room , turned slowly to face the bookshelf . Plato stared back at him impassively . He realized he had been asking all the wrong questions . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That world had ended ; Bet was right . The only question Chester really needed to address was this : Did he want to go on in the new world ? Otherwise he ought to bring himself to an end as well . He reread the inscription on its base . " No evil can happen to a good man , either in life or after death . " He picked the bust up for the first time since his arrival ; its weight tingled down his arm . With a strangled cry , he hurled the bronze at the wall . It rang hollowly and skittered across the floor . Gone , all gone : his precious plastique , his measure of ready death . The bust was as empty as his takeover plan . Like every other refusenik on the farm , Chester had been deluding himself . <p> He sat on the bed and felt a moment of vast relief . It was out of his hands ; he had done everything he could but the damned C-K 's had outwitted him . Roberta . So this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with a bang . What had she said ? There was not enough explosive at the farm to cause much of a blast . <p> And then he was angry . <p> He found her in her office . <p> " Oh , that , " she said . " Dwight emptied it out the first day . We have a weekly weapons scan , of course . " <p> " Without a search warrant ? What about the right to privacy ? " <p> " You want privacy ? Leave us and go back to the world . Citizens have rights , " she said patiently . " You have very deliberately chosen not to be a citizen . " <p> He was about to tell her that was un-American but she did n't give him the chance . <p> " What did you expect , Chester ? That we did n't know how dangerous the unboosted mind can be ? You think we forgot the history of the twentieth century , with all its political terrorists , religious fanatics , mass murderers ? We did it for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are people here with problems . Do you want Darla Coy making life and death decisions for you ? Well , she does n't want you making any irrevocable decisions for her either . " <p> " And what about Bet Wiley ? You 're using her against us . Or is she a plant ? " <p> " Bet Wiley is a seriously disturbed woman with her own agenda . If you asked her , she 'd probably say that she was using me , according to some plan the Mother of God left on a piece of toast . If I knew some way to convince Bet to reboost , I would do it in a second . It is true that she has helped close several accommodation farms ; she 's convinced many of the stubbomest refuseniks we have to take the treatment . But whatever good she has accomplished is far outweighed by the pain she suffers . We do not believe in sacrifice , Chester . Everyone deserves sanity . " <p> Chester sagged as the anger drained out of him . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to you , Chester . Always has been . " <p> 10 . In the common room , Emil had Gail Wood in a comer : " I had a vision , Sister Gail ! It came flooding over me . " He moved his hands like a hypnotist . " I was just the receiver , however ; it was intended for you . I was only the channel . " <p> ' My goodness , " said Gail Wood . " What  --  what sort of vision ? " <p> " I was transported to an alternate universe . In it the Red Sox retained the rights to Babe Ruth . He only hit five hundred and sixty-three home runs in his career , but he pitched more , winning one hundred and thirty games . In Fenway that 's not bad ! And the Sox won the series in ' 26 , ' 28 , ' 32 , ' 51 , and ' 74 ! The curse of the Bambino is alleviated , Sister Gail ! " <p> There were tears in Gail Wood 's eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Babe , he asked about you . He wants you to know that your suffering , in this universe , helped the Sox triumph elsewhere . He 's sorry  --  " <p> Gail Wood was soon to accept treatment , Chester saw . Emil was good , an efficient emissary for Bet Wiley 's message . Chester felt a little stir of competitiveness ; he wanted to be responsible for some conversions himself before this farm closed , before he and Emil accepted C-K treatment . He recalled again what little the two of them shared : a love of rhetoric . And a belief in conversions . How odd that they had both surrendered to the same conversion here at the farm . <p> Bet Wiley 's message was beautiful . She 'd been to the promised land and come back , and she wanted Emil and Chester and the other holdouts to have what she 'd had , so badly that she was willing to delay her own return to paradise . She wanted to make sure that every last holdout was aboard before she went back herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convince them in a way the C-K 's never could . <p> Ironically , it was Roberta Welch , with her typical C-K impatience and condescension , who had provided the final evidence . Bet was n't a plant . The C-K 's could n't even grasp the nature of her Martyrdom . Bet was so like Emil and Chester  --  they three were the last to understand what it was to have a cause . Bet , however , had discerned what Emil and Chester could n't : there was only one cause left to have . <p> Chester felt marvelously odd . What a thing it was , after a lifetime , to be a convert . <p> He wandered out of the room , rehearsing speeches in his head . Rhetoric would have one last moment of glory , would flare before it died . He decided to find Allan Fence . Fence  --  now there would be a challenge . Chester could n't see him responding very well to Emil . No , he was certainly Chester 's responsibility . <p> Nut to crack , to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him self ! <p> <p> By Jonathan Lethem , John Kessel , and James Patrick Kelly <p> When John Kessel stopped doing regular book review columns for us , he promised to send us short fiction . The first story to cross my desk was " The True History of the End of the World , " his collaboration with two other award-winning writers , Jonathan Lethem and James Patrick Kelly <p> Jonathan Lethem , the designated spokesman for the team , gave the true history of the story 's genesis thusly : " This collaboration was hatched over breakfast in a hotel restaurant on the Sunday morning of a weekend convention . Had the coffee been stronger , you might not be reading this today . Terry Bisson was at the table with us ; we refer any further questions to him . " <p>
