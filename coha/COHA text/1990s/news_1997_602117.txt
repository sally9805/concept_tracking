<p> " Dan Marino is still The Man . He 's the best player we 've got . . . . The guy who 's going to lead us to the Big Dance . Everybody on the team knows that . " <p>  --  Linebacker Zach Thomas <p> DAVIE , Fla.  --  Before long , the Miami Dolphins ' locker room will come alive with vibrant youth . Jason Taylor , the rapidly emerging defensive end , will playfully rough up a teammate in a corner . Baby-faced defensive backs will crank up the volume on a boom box in another corner . <p> Yet for a few minutes before team meetings this week , Dan Marino has an empty , serene locker room all to himself . <p> It 's fitting . Since Marino 's 324-yard performance in Sunday 's 16-13 victory against Tennessee , debate ( and furor ) ignited by coach Jimmy Johnson 's admission that he considered relieving Marino amid Week 1 struggles , has calmed down a bit . <p> No , Marino , gearing up for Miami 's ( 2-0 ) big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of attention . <p> " The thing that bothers you is that I 'm out here working hard to do my job , " Marino says . " I 'm a professional in what I 'm doing , and I take a lot of pride in it . Anytime someone questions that , it hurts some . But last week , I just did n't worry about it . I go about my job and do my thing . " <p> As Marino unwinds , he unfastens a knee brace and moves gingerly . On Monday he turns 36 , which makes him an NFL version of a golden oldie . This is his 15th NFL season . <p> Says Marino : " I feel real good throwing the ball . I think my legs  --  because of all the operations , the Achilles problem , broke my ankle  --  can sometimes be a concern . " <p> That 's one reason backup Craig Erickson is fresh on Johnson 's mind . Since an amazing string of 155 consecutive starts ended with a torn right Achilles ' tendon in 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery ( 1995 ) and a broken ankle ( 1996 ) . <p> " I 've got a quarterback that 's going to be 36 , and he 's had some injuries , " Johnson says . " I want to be prepared . If we 've got a good team , I do n't all of a sudden want to take a lot of steps backward , because my backup quarterback 's not ready . " <p> To some , it seems like a slap in the face for Johnson to ponder thoughts such as finding snaps to keep Erickson sharp . <p> Says Erickson , who played for Johnson for two years at the University of Miami : " If anything , I think it was Coach Johnson 's way of telling everybody on this team to be ready " <p> Youth is served <p> Sitting in his office this week , Johnson lets out a hearty laugh when asked if he felt sting from public support of Marino . <p> " Puh-leeze , " he said . " I think you know : I 'm going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself with the critics . " <p> But Johnson does seem interested in perceptions . While driving home Sunday , he called a postgame radio show to dispute a fan 's opinion . <p> " Sometimes , these talk-show hosts , and media , can go on a tangent and it 's like a runaway train , " Johnson and . " And if it 's not going in the right direction , I want to straighten them out . Because misinformation can feed on itself . ( CNN analyst ) Ron Meyer said something about replacing Dan Marino . I did n't say anything about replacing . I said , ' Take him out for a couple of series . ' <p> " But some little old lady at home that loves Dan Marino and she 's 90 years old , she says , ' How can he possibly bench Dan Marino ? ' I said if he 's not 100% mentally or physically and not at the top of his game , put Erickson in for a couple of series . I was very clear that Dan would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marino issue is perhaps more sensitive amid the larger picture : A mass housecleaning and youth movement has been in full swing . <p> With 39 players added since Johnson 's arrival last year , only 14 remain from Don Shula 's last team . With an average age of 25.9 , Miami is the AFC 's third-youngest team . Nine rookies made the 1996 squad ; 14 rookie and first-year players are on the current squad . <p> " The rebuilding is on schedule , " Johnson says . " We 're still extremely young and inexperienced in some areas , but we 'll only get better . The big setback this year has been injuries . " <p> The latest : fullback Kevin Pritchett , out at least two months after surgery for a dislocated right kneecap . <p> ( Already out for the year : first-round receiver Yatil Green , defensive end Dan Stubbs and special-teams ace Kirby Dar Dar with knee injuries ; special teamer Larry Izzo with a torn Achilles ' tendon . ) <p> Losing the underrated Pritchett is another blow to a sputtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes and inconsistent route-running . <p> Growing pains <p> Despite Johnson 's heavy emphasis on running , Miami 's 2.8-yard average rush is third-lowest in the NFL . Last Sunday , Karim Abdul-Jabbar was held to zero or negative yards on seven of 19 carries . <p> Says Johnson , " Ninety percent of our problems occur when we do n't block it right . " <p> The poor running connects to a horrid red-zone touchdown rate . Miami had the NFL 's best TD rate in ' 96 after crossing the opponent 's 20-yard line ( 62% ) . In nine red-zone trips this season ? Two TDs ( 22.2% ) . <p> Even so , Miami has won behind an aggressive defense reflecting the youth and speed Johnson craves . With six starters in their first or second seasons , Miami has allowed the NFL 's third-fewest points , 23 . <p> Says receiver O.J. McDuffie , who remembers 38-35 shootouts , " It 's weird for them to be carrying the load right now . " <p> It 's a small defense , averaging just 263 pounds on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players it took to stop Eddie George on a sweep , they bring swarming enthusiasm . <p> " We all want to be around the ball , " says second-year strong safety Shawn Wooden , an early-season standout . " We 're not the biggest defense in the league . So we have to compensate with our speed . " <p> Miami expects to build on this with more salary-cap room . Under this year 's $ 41.5 million cap , Miami pays nearly $ 7 million to ex-players . <p> But Johnson , who says re-signing Erickson is a priority , projects entering 1998 with 49 players under contract and perhaps $ 4 million in cap room to pursue free agents . <p> For now , Johnson 's imprint is paying dividends . Miami spends perhaps as much time as any team on special teams , perhaps a reason big plays in the kicking game were pivotal in both victories . <p> And late last week , Johnson added the no-huddle offense as a game-plan wrinkle , keying the passing game Sunday . <p> Better consistency from a defense routinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But now a major test : the high-powered Packers . <p> " It 's not the most important game of the season , " cornerback Terrell Buckley says . " But in order to be the champs , you 've got to see how you measure up against the champs . " <p> Says Johnson : " The best measuring stick will be at the end of December , when they total it up . . . . If we win , it will be a nice measuring stick . " <p> To beat Green Bay , Miami could use a big day from No. 13 , coming off his first 300-yard game in 15 starts under Johnson . With rushing woes , you can bet Marino 's game . <p> " Danny 's always intense , ready to go , " McDuffie says . " Things just did n't work out the first week . We were all off . But it 's up to all of us to release some of the load on his back . He ca n't do it all himself . "
