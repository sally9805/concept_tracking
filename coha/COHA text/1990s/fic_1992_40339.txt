My mother gave birth of Adak Island , a small hunk of rock and snow far out on the Aleutian chain , in the middle of the Bering Sea . My father was serving two years as a dentist in the Navy ; he had wanted Alaska because he liked hunting and fishing , but he obviously had not known about Adak at the time of his request . Had my mother known , she would have scratched out the request herself . Given enough information , my mother has never made the wrong choice . <p> So it was that she refused to have her sweltering , jaundiced baby yanked out of Adak 's underground naval hospital and thrown into the jet that sat waiting on the runway for more than six hours . Because my temperature was 105 deg and still climbing , the doctors and my father recommended that I be flown to the mainland , to a real hospital ( no one on Adak survived even a mild heart attack while we were there  --  no one ) , but my mother refused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an animal , instinctive fear , that the moment I was borne aloft , I would perish . She placed me in an ordinary white bathtub filled with cold water , and there I survived . Flourished , even . My orange , blotchy skin gradually calmed to a healthy baby pink , my limbs unlocked , and I flailed my legs in the waters until she lifted me out and we both slept . <p> When my father had finished his sentence with the Navy , we moved to Ketchikan , an island in southeastern Alaska , where he bought a dental practice and , three years later , a fishing boat . The boat was a new twenty-three-foot Uniflite fiber-glass cabin cruiser . Still wearing his dental smock beneath his jacket , he launched the boat late on a Friday afternoon as we cheered from shore . He slipped it into its stall in the docks , and the next morning he stood on the edge of those docks looking down thirty feet through clear , icy Alaskan water to where the Snow Goose sat like a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named it the Snow Goose because he had been filled with dreams of its white hull flying over the waves , but he had forgotten to put in the drain plugs the afternoon of the launching . Unlike my mother , he had neither eyes nor ears for matters below the surface . <p> That summer , as we flew back over the waves from a day of fishing ( my father had had the Snow Goose raised and cleaned , proof that persistence can sometimes make up for a lack of vision ) , I would be on the open but high-sided back deck with the day 's catch of halibut , flopping into the air with them each time my father sailed over one wave and smashed into the next . The halibut themselves lay flat , like gray-green dogs on the white deck of the boat , their large brown eyes looking up at me hopefully until I whacked them with a hammer . My job was to keep them from flopping out of the boat . They had terrific strength in those wide , flat bodies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send themselves two or three feet in the air , their white undersides flashing . Between us a kind of understanding developed : if they did n't flop , I did n't smash their heads with the hammer . But sometimes , when the ride was especially wild and we were all thrown again and again into the air and their blood and slime was all over me , I gave out a few extra whacks , an inclination of which I am ashamed . And the other halibut , with their round brown eyes and long , judicious mouths , did see . <p> When we docked after those trips , my mother would check everything over , drain plugs included , while my father stood by . I played on my knees on the weathered boards of the dock , and once saw a terrifying creature crawl from a rusty tin can that had been knocked on its side . Repulsed by those barbarous legs , I howled and went over backward into the water . I was fished out soon enough , and thrown in a hot shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one had told me about salamanders  --  I honestly never had dreamed of amphibians  --  but on first sight I knew they were a step in the wrong direction . <p> Shortly after this , when I was nearing five years old , my father began to believe that he , too , had made steps in the wrong direction , and he set out in search of the kinds of experiences he felt he had been denied . My mother was only the second woman he had ever dated , but to this list he now added the dental hygienist who worked for him . The nights at our house were soon filled with a general keening of previously unimaginable variation and persistence . <p> I abandoned ship one night when my father was crying alone in the living room and my mother was breaking things in their bedroom . She did n't utter any human sounds , but I could chart her progress around their room by imagining the sources of wood snapping , glass shattering , and plaster crumbling . I slipped out into the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rain , and wandered in my pajamas down the other side of the street , peering in dark , low living-room windows and listening at doors , until at one door I heard a humming sound that was unfamiliar to me . <p> I went around to the side of the house , opened the screen door , and pressed my ear to cold wood . The sound seemed lower now , almost a moan , barely audible . <p> The door was locked , but I lifted up the rubber corner of the welcome mat and , just as at our house , the key was there . So I went in . <p> I discovered that the buzzing sound was the air-pump filter on a fish tank . Something about wandering alone through someone else 's house was awful , and I moved solemnly across the linoleum to take a seat high on a kitchen stool . I watched the orange-and-black-striped fish suck at pebbles and spit them out . The tank contained larger rocks , too : lava rocks with dark caves and crannies out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foil . Some had bright red-and-blue bodies , others had bright orange bodies . <p> I thought perhaps the fish were hungry . I went to the refrigerator and saw sweet pickles , opened the jar , and brought it back for the fish to see . I found slots on top of the tank , toward the back , and dropped the pickles in , one or two at first , then the whole jar , slice by slice , and finally poured the juice in , too , so that the tank water swelled up and ran in beads over the side . <p> I stared at the pickle slices floating brightly in with the fish , some of them sinking and twirling . They bounced slowly over the bright pink and blue rocks below . The orange-striped fish had all flashed about the tank as I had been pouring , but they , too , now moved slowly . They leaned a little to one side as they swam , and several rested on the rocks . Others stretched their long , see-through cartilage mouths at the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fins rippled as delicately as fine lace . <p> When the pickle slices had settled more , they rocked like sleeping fish just above the pink and blue gravel , and the real fish rocked silently beside them , as if in gentle groves of eelgrass and sunken lily pads . The image was beautiful , and in that moment of beauty I strained forward . <p> I pressed my hands and face against the glass and gazed into the mute black core of one of those silvery eyes . I felt as if I , too , were floating , gently rocking , oddly out of place , and in that flicker of a moment I caught myself feeling the rocking and , perceiving myself perceiving , realized that I was I. This distracted me ; then forgot what had distracted me , lost interest in the fish , and , after slapping my feet across the linoleum of the kitchen floor , passed again into the soft , dark rain . <p> Three years later , after my mother and I had moved down to California , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become an ichthyologist . My parents had separated , of course , startled nearly as much by what I had done as by what they themselves had been doing all along . Any connection between my vandalism and their nighttime exchanges was completely mysterious to them . <p> My first aquarium was only a clear plastic tray of the kind most often used to hold nuts and bolts . In it were two goldfish I had won at the county fair and some gravel my mother had bought at Sal 's Fishworld on our way home . <p> I watched over those thin , pale goldfish , but the tray had no cover , and after our cat , Smokey , snagged them with his paw and ate them on our counter top as I watched , unable to move , my mother took me down to Sal 's and bought a proper ten-gallon tank with a bubble filter , more gravel , a wide-leaved plastic plant , a piece of volcanic rock with a hole in it , a few goldfish , and even one of those orange-and-black-striped fish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clown loaches . <p> We watched those fish every evening , cleaned their tank every weekend , and also survived the occasional ich plague : a sudden , mysterious proliferation of white spots on fins and tails that threatened to kill them all . <p> We buried the first of the deceased in elaborate ceremonies , during which my mother would sit beside me on her knees in the dirt and I would wear an old white bedsheet . The fish themselves were always wrapped in many layers of toilet paper , placed in small boxes , and buried six inches under , where the cat would n't dig them up . <p> Soon we just flushed the fish down the toilet and replaced them , but even then they were all I thought about . I wrote reports on them at school in lieu of book reports . My elementary school teachers never seemed to catch on and apparently believed I had really read books titled The Clown Loach , The Silver Dollars , The Iridescent Shark , and The Plecostemus , or Bottom-Sucker . Everything in human life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicately by , all glamour and glitz , while behind them their waste trailed in streamers . Suckers at the bottom of the tank ate this waste , spat it out in disgust , and roved on , still hungry . And within five minutes of placing two new silver dollars in the tank , I saw real brutality . These silver dollars were large , thin fish , nearly identical in shape and shine to the coins after which they had been named , and once out of their plastic bag from Sal 's , they swam up on either side of my one lazy , boggle-eyed iridescent shark . This iridescent shark had been badly misnamed ; he was in actuality no more than a long , thin goldfish with a shiny body and two large , bulbous eyes . The silver dollars were slick and merciless and knew how to work as a team . In one quick flash each went for an eye and sucked it out . They did n't even swallow , but let the round , billiard-ball eyes float dreamily down to the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother was swift in her retribution . The silver dollars were netted and flushed within minutes , and we spent that evening together watching the iridescent shark bump blindly into the sides of the tank , waiting for him to die . <p> As we spent these years in California , leading steadily more circumscribed lives , my father ranged farther and farther up in Alaska , and everything he did seemed to lack sense . He had never enjoyed dentistry , and felt now that perhaps fishing was more what he wanted to do . In this I believe he was right , and he was certainly earnest , but he did n't think ahead very well . He sold his practice , ordered a beautiful , expensive , sixty-three-foot aluminum commercial fishing boat , to be completed before the halibut season , and persuaded my uncle to be the crew . They had fished together for sport all their lives , but neither of them had any experience on a commercial fishing boat , and they were to be the only two on board . My father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worked first on another boat or had hired a captain . <p> He named this boat the Osprey . Whereas the Snow Goose was a bird that flew its white wings over the waves on short one-and two-day sport-fishing jaunts , the Osprey was a more wide-ranging creature . With wingspans of up to six feet , ospreys are known to soar far out over the waters in vast arcs and circles , and they often soar alone . <p> The Osprey was not finished on time , so my father and my uncle entered the season a month and a half late . In their hurry they fouled one of the halibut lines they had set , thus jamming for more than a week the huge hydraulic wheel that pulled the fish in , and of course they caught almost nothing . The loss of above $100,000 that year on fishing alone left my father undaunted , however , because he had already entered the last beautiful , desperate , far-ranging circlings of his life . <p> My uncle tells of one night on the bridge of the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time at gin rummy , instead of looking glum and muttering an insincere congratulation , curved his back suddenly and spread wide his arms . Standing up on his captain 's chair amid the blue-white glow of radar and sonar , he stretched out his chin , tilted what my uncle remembers to this day as a distinctly curved beak , and squawked out , " Three degrees starboard ! " My uncle adjusted the automatic pilot accordingly , and in the morning they set what was to be one of only three or four successful lines that trip . <p> This correlation between my father 's predictions and actual success was rare , however . The hardware store he had also invested in that year collapsed , as did the price of gold , the IRS 's patience with his tax dodges in South American countries ( he was angry at having to pay Social Security , which , ironically enough , supported us after his death ) , and his relationship with his **27;28;TOOLONG . In short , the year was not a good one . I spent all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each night during that vacation , as I lay in a sleeping bag on the hotel-room floor at the foot of his bed , I heard his tossings and turnings until very late and sensed , with the assurance children sometimes have , that he would n't be my father for much longer . His movements came in cycles that were closing in steadily around him . He kicked wildly at the sheets , groaning in frustration , anger , and despair , until they billowed and ruffled like an offshore wind . Then he sank , face-first , utterly resigned and collapsed , into his pillow to weep , before beginning the cycle again . I assumed all along that he thought I was no longer awake , since he had never to my knowledge let himself weep in front of anyone . But one night he spoke to me . <p> " I just do n't know , " he said aloud . " Harper , are you awake " <p> " Yes . " <p> " God , I just do n't know . " <p> That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I wanted only to shrink farther down into my sleeping bag . He had a terrific pain in his head that painkillers could n't reach , an airiness in his voice that was only becoming more hollow , and other mysteries of despair I did n't want to see or hear . I knew where he was headed , as we all did , but I did n't know why . And I did n't want to know . <p> My father ranged farther and farther that next year in the Osprey , changing gear for albacore off Mexico , then again for king crab in the Bering Sea . He began to sportfish off the wide , high stern , and one day caught several large salmon , which he gutted on the spot . With the return to port and sale of the failed Osprey imminent ( after two years of horrible losses he could no longer even get a loan ) , with the IRS closing in , and with no further flights imagined , he took his .44 magnum handgun from the cabin and walked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy , gray-white sky and the cries of gulls , his boots slathered with the dark blood of freshly caught salmon . He may have paused for a moment to reflect , but I doubt it . His momentum was made up only of air , without the distraction of ground . He spattered himself amid the entrails of salmon ; his remains were picked at by gulls for several hours before my uncle came up from the engine room and found him . <p> My mother and I survived . Not having taken off to any heights , we had nowhere to fall . We drank clear bouillon soup with a few peas in it after my uncle called and told us the news , and in the evening , as the light in the sky faded to blue and then black , we sat in our living room , in the fluorescent glow of the fish tank , watching . The iridescent shark had learned to find his way around by now , and bumped less frequently into the glass . The empty sockets , their rawness originally laced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered over by an opaque white film . The tiger-striped archer fish , who was half jaw , half tail , who swam always at a forty-five-degree angle to the surface of the water , and who could spit sizable water pellets , was skimming his strong lower lip along the surface , waiting , and at some point  --  I have no idea when , since time stands still after a death , with no sensation of passing  --  I rose to bring him the jar of flies . I let one into the air space between hood and water , covered the hole again with tape , and sat down beside my mother to watch this ritual of the familiar , a relic from what our lives had been ; but I knew now that I had lost interest . The archer fish tensed up , danced in a fluttering circle with his hooked lip at the surface the fulcrum , followed the mad flight of the fly with quiet deliberation , and spat his pellet of water with such celerity and yet so little movement that it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly was there , mired in the water , sending off his million tiny ripples of panic . <p>
