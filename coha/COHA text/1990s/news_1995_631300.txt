<p> Nobody does it better . OK , Sean Connery did it a little better , but that 's not the point . Nobody can stand in a bathroom and say the magic words better than one man . His name is Brosnan . Pierce Brosnan . <p> The frist time he said the words  --  " I 'm Bond , James Bond "  --  Brosnan was in the tastefully decorated bathroom of his spacious Malibu home . He was brushing his teeth and with a mouthful of Crest , Brosnan looked directly in the mirror and flubbed the line . <p> " Oh yeah , I 'm James Bond . " That 's what he said . The distraught future supersleuth proceeded to floss . In disgust . <p> It 's too bad the second time he said those words was not over the baccarat table in Monte Carlo . Instead , it was in his BMW , the one without the special laser guns that come out of the headlights . Brosnan was swerving down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles in a mess of traffic when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio , adjusted the rearview mirror and started muttering , " Bond , James Bond , James Bond . I 'm Big Jim . Jimbo Bond . " <p> " The drivers next door looked at me like I was demented , " Brosnan recalls . <p> The third time was the charm . Brosnan finally said his signature line on the set of " Goldeneye " ( opening Friday ) , the 17th film in the 33-year-old Bond series . <p> Interrogate Brosnan and he spills his guts . It was 10 minutes to lunch and 250 extras had gathered to watch him proclaim that he was Bond . Brosnan was picking up women in a casino set , sipping his martini  --  actually Evian water shaken , not stirred . A Bond girl sashayed over and purred , " What is your name ? " <p> " They go in for my closeup and three words went through my mind , " Brosnan says . Would those be " Bond . James Bond ? " <p> Brosnan shakes his head and repeats the three words : " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bond 's a little nervous . A little cocky . A little scared . As the debonair Brosnan sits over breakfast at the Four Seasons Hotel , scads of Bondian questions hang in the air . <p> Can he do it better ? <p> Can he save the world and sleep with as many women as possible ? <p> Can he get through his first press outing without whipping out his Walther PPK ? <p> Those are the easy ones , as it turns out . The inquiries he has fielded today have tended toward the ridiculous . Such as : " James Bond has a license to kill . If he had a license to do anything , what would he do ? " <p> " Uh , " Brosnan says in his charming English accent as he adjusts the collar of his navy blue Bondish suit , " Find a cure for cancer or AIDS . " <p> Or : " What is his favorite drink and how does he like it ? " <p> " Jack Daniel 's . On the rocks . " <p> And : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , what would he as James do ? " <p> " He 'd probably take the kid out in the Aston Martin and freak the heck out of him with the ejector seat , " Brosnan says with a smile . Scratch the guest shot on " Parenting Today . " <p> " What is James Bond 's idea of a pickup line ? " <p> " Lie down , " Brosnan says with shaky bravado . <p> And finally : " If your former TV character Remington Steele and Bond were in a duel to the death , who would win ? " <p> " Remington Steele would n't stand a chance , " says Brosnan in mock disgust . <p> Of course , Brosnan once entertained thoughts of blowing up Remington . Or offing him in some other way . As the story goes , in 1986 Brosnan 's NBC series where he played a sleuth with perfectly blow-dried hair was freshly canceled when he got the call to be the fourth Bond in " The Living Daylights . " <p> " I did the wardrobe fittings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me signing the Bond contract . Then it got snatched away . " <p> " Remington Steele " producers  --  in an effort to capitalize on Brosnan 's newfound fame  --  renewed the series and made it contractually impossible for him to find the time to film a Bond movie . <p> Brosnan was understandably upset . " Bond is the part of an actor 's life . " Then again , he adds , " I really do n't think I was equipped to do the role in 1986 . I remember the script for ' Living Daylights ' sat beside my bed for 60 days while negotiations were going on . I never read the script . I felt intimidated by it , if the truth be known . <p> " I 've never admitted this until recently , but there was also a sense of relief that Bond did n't happen for me back then . It was like . . . " <p> He takes a deep intake of breath . Brosnan thought his Bondian chances were history . Never say never ! <p> " When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . It was unfinished business in my life . And it feels right . I 'm older . There is a bit more age on the face . There are more scars on the soul and on the heart . " <p> Scars . Three years ago , Brosnan 's wife , Cassandra Harris , died of ovarian cancer . Ironically , Brosnan met his wife when she was starring as a Bond girl in " For Your Eyes Only . " That is not the only reason he feels fated to play Bond . <p> " Bond is a widower , ironically . <p> " The first movie I ever saw in my life was ' Goldfinger . ' I was 11 years old and that woman . . . . Well , let 's just say it made an impression . <p> " Pierce Brendan Brosnan left Ireland to go to London on Aug. 12 , 1964 , the same day Ian Fleming died . So blame numerology or the Dalai Lama , whatever . This was fate . " <p> It 's also a little scary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's press a year ago to announce the movie . Then I went back to my hotel and thought , ' What have I done ? ' I will be stamped with this character forever . I am Bond No. 5 . " <p> He 's quick to point out that his Bond will carry on the well-established tradition  --  even in these politically correct times . <p> " He 's not a wimp . " Bond is still a sexist . " The man gets the girl , makes love to her or smacks her around , " says Brosnan , recalling a scene that 's downplayed in " Goldeneye . " <p> What did Brosnan make of his Bond girls ? " Oh they 're lovely , " he says . Lovely ? One tries to kill him by squeezing him to death with her thighs . " Hey , that scene was bloody hard work , " says Brosnan . <p> Will PC ' 90s women still love the guy ? " For women there is still that element of fantasy there . He 's so commanding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes decisions and takes command of it sexually . That 's a turn-on for women . I 've met women like that , " says Brosnan . <p> Does a ' 90s Bond practice safe sex ? <p> " Of course , " says Brosnan . " But he 's not limiting the number of partners . Bond is still Bond . If you do n't make him that way then you do n't want a Bond movie . What turned people on about Connery is that he went through women like there was no tomorrow . He was so damn arrogant about it , too . That 's what turns women on , whether they like it or not . And if you do n't like it , do n't go see the movie . " <p> Or the next couple . Brosnan is signed on for two more Bonds , one of which he would like Quentin Tarantino to direct . <p> " My dream Bond is Quentin at the helm , me , and Sharon Stone or Madeleine Stowe as the Bond girls , " he dreams out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumped up . A " Robinson Crusoe " film he did for TV was recently snapped up by Miramax as a feature film . " Suddenly Bond comes into your life and everybody wants to be your best friend .
