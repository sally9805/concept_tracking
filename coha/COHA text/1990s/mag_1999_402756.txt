COSMIC GAMMA-RAY BURSTS ( GRBs ) ARE NOT ONLY THE most powerful explosions in the universe ; they are also the most concentrated and the fastest acting ( S &T:; February 1998 , page 20 ) . Astronomers continue to struggle with the mystery of what could cause such vast energy , the equivalent of tens or hundreds of supernovae , to erupt from a tiny volume less than a few hundred kilometers wide . Recently the bursts have been yielding up a few of their secrets - but only slowly and reluctantly . After two years of massive efforts , astronomers have detected faint , visible-light counterparts for a total of eight bursts . These * 1ptical transients " are typically a feeble 20th to 22nd magnitude when first seen , and they fade out in a few days or weeks . But they have served to pinpoint the bursts ' locations to a fraction of an arcsecond . At first these accurate positions seemed to pose a shocking problem : many of the burst sites appeared to be located not in galaxies but in empty intergalactic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has been solved  --  thanks to very deep scrutiny with the world 's most powerful telescopes . GRB host galaxies were not seen at first because they are extremely far away ( two to 10 times farther than previously believed ) and in some cases are intrinsically dim . " There has never been an optical transient well studied and confirmed that does not have a host galaxy right under it , " declares Joshua S. Bloom , a graduate student at Caltech . The eight host galaxies identified so far range from magnitude 23 to 26 in red light . For three of them astronomers have managed to measure redshifts : the values are an impressively large 0.8 , 1.0 , and 3.4 , putting the galaxies roughly 6 , 7 , and 1I billion light-years away , respectively . We see the host galaxies ( and the bursts ) as they appeared when the universe was only a small fraction of its present age . GRB host galaxies do not seem very noteworthy otherwise . All show higher rates of star formation than today 's Milky Way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the host of GRB 970508 ) is a faint blue dwarf like the Large Magellanic Cloud , a galaxy type abundant early in the universe 's history . Another ( GRB 980703 ) is a more luminous galaxy undergoing vigorous star formation . The farthest and most powerful of the three bursts ( which garnered headlines last spring as " the biggest explosion . since the Big Bang " ) was seen in December 1997 in a normal-size galaxy that seems typical of others at its redshift . " The emerging picture , " says Bloom , " is that there is no emerging picture . " It is becoming evident , however , that the mystery objects causing gamma-ray bursts were not ejected from their galaxies beforehand . This is bad news for the theory that a GRB is caused by a pair of neutron stars spiraling together and coalescing . Some fraction of neutron-star binaries would be kicked a noticeable distance from their home galaxies by their violent births in supernovae much earlier . Moreover , the binary neutronstar idea may not account for the energy of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though this is under debate . // One way to account for gamma-ray bursts . If a neutron star spins much faster on the inside than on the outside , any magnetic field threading the star can be wound up tightly to extreme strength within it . The field lines would outline the surface of a cylinder . When the field becomes strong enough , the matter in which it is embedded becomes buoyant and floats up toward one of the star 's poles . When the field breaks the surface more than 105 ' ergs of energy are released in less than a millisecond . // Many theorists now favor the " hypernova " model , in which a burst happens when a young , very massive star collapses to a black hole under just the right conditions . Such an event would happen only in a galaxy 's star-forming regions . This process , however , may account for only a different , weaker type of gamma-ray burst - the kind seen last April 25th in conjunction with an unusual supernova in a galaxy a mere 140 million light-years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In any case , theorists have become convinced of one thing : most bursts can not arise from a simple , fast , clean explosion that destroys its progenitor object . A typical burst displays a complex light curve full of spikes , pulses , and grumblings that continue anywhere from a fraction of a second to several minutes . These mysterious , violent variations must reflect a protracted series of energy releases within the source itself , theorists insist , not an expanding fireball 's interaction with its surroundings later . A new model that purports to address all the various needs is offered by Wlodzimiere Kluzniak ( University of Wisconsin ) and Malvin A. Ruderman ( Columbia University ) in the October 1 Astrophysical Journal Letters . They write that enough energy for even the most powerful burst could be stored in , and released fitfully from , a differentially rotating neutron star . If the object 's fluid interior spins roughly a thousand times per second faster than its solid crust ( or vice versa ) , an extreme magnetic field of up to about 10l7 gauss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched rubber bands . The tightly wound magnetic region would become buoyant , float to the star 's surface , and erupt into space . Each eruption should take about a ten-thousandth of a second and slow the star 's spin substantially Such a violent object might start as an ordinary millisecond pulsar of the sort found throughout the Milky Way 's disk . These show no great preference for starforming regions . Some very different models , by contrast , invoke processes that happen only near the supermassive black hole in a galaxy 's nucleus . For such reasons , astronomers are eager to pin down exactly where bursts occur in galaxies - and this means collecting more optical counterparts . The number increases frustratingly slowly . Bursts happen about every day , but only rarely can the location of one be pinned down accurately enough to point a large telescope at it . And that takes 4 to 8 hours with today 's orbiting X- and gammaray observatories . A fading optical transient has been detected in only half the cases when such a follow-up has been possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamma- and X-ray observatory , which its builders expect to launch in the spring of 2000 , should pinpoint many more bursts and cut the follow-up time to a matter of seconds . Maybe then the floodgates of discovery will break loose . Photograph A gamma-ray burst site pinpointed by the Hubble Space Telescope .
