After the final bets were in , Okiki , a 13-year-old honor student , sat stony- faced at her desk in English class , silently preparing to collect a couple of hundred dollars on a dare . She had settled on a simple plan . Just wait for the bell to ring , reach into her book bag , grab the 12-in. fillet knife she had brought from home and stab the teacher in the chest while Marlena , a 12- year-old accomplice , pinned her down . Then  --  whoosh  --  instant respect . <P> With minutes to go , Okiki just stared straight ahead at the teacher , her arms tightly crossed . What could possibly run through the mind of a 13-year- old girl when she is about to kill ? How hard to strike ? How many times ? Will it be messy ? Okiki 's hands and legs were visibly trembling . And outside in the hallway another student was sobbing . <P> Assistant principal Jacqueline Greenhill happened by and found the crying girl . " You can tell when a student is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenhill to another student , who sent her to another who finally revealed the plot : two girls were planning to kill teacher Jan Kirk , 46 , at the end of class that morning . Something about being embarrassed or insulted by Kirk the day before . Other students , maybe a dozen or so , wagered $200 in lunch money that the two would n't do it . But only fools bet against peer pressure . And the bell was about to ring . <P> When Greenhill entered the classroom , a few students whispered , " Get her now ! Get her now ! " while others said , " You better not . " The assistant principal intervened and ordered the two conspirators to her office , where she confiscated the knife and called the police . Last Friday , Okiki and Marlena were charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated murder . Now parents , teachers and the 700 students at Irving Middle School in Lorain , Ohio , a racially mixed , economically strained town of 70,000 , are looking for explanations . They are talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City and Detroit that use Lorain as a drop point , the 11-year-old boy who held up a minimart at gunpoint last September and turned out to have had 46 previous encounters with the police . The townspeople , especially the young , " do n't believe there 's a future , " says school superintendent Thomas Bollin . " At least they do n't act like they believe there 's a future . " <P> Every time another knife or gun is drawn in one of the nation 's classrooms , parents search for some reason why it was an unusual case , why it could n't happen in their community . But the exception to the rule has become exceptionally common . The National Education Association estimates that every day 100,000 students carry a gun to class ; another study reports that 13% of all incidents involving guns in the schools occur in elementary and preschools . This month the Los Angeles school district will initiate spot checks with portable metal detectors in many of its schools . <P> Every school day , 6,250 teachers are threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas a fifth-grade boy arrived at his school in Chicago one morning toting a concoction of household cleaners , including bleach , and poured it into his teacher 's coffee . The teacher did not drink the brew , and the boy 's classmates turned him in . Last week an eighth- grader in Washington shot a school guard in the stomach after he broke up a fight between rival gangs .
