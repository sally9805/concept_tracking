ASK BILLY CRYSTAL HOW HE GOT STARTed , and he will say in the living room , where as the youngest and shortest of three boys , he was also the loudest . " After dinner , we would perform for 20 or so relatives impressions of Aunt Rose with the sagging upper arms and Uncle Max with the pants the size of New Jersey . " He learned show-biz patter , pulling his chair alongside the old Magnavox TV and pretending to be the next guest on the Jack Paar show , peeking down Jayne Mansfield 's dress and rolling his eyes , flacking his latest gig . " You know , Jack , I 'm really looking forward to eighth grade . A lot of interesting transfers , some hot new teachers  --  it 's going to be a good year . " <P> He graduated to stand-up after listening to comedy albums his father would bring home from his job at Commodore Music , a record label and store in Manhattan . For visits to Grandma 's house on Thanksgiving , Mom packed a suitcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kovacs ' Nairobi Trio and take turns as Mel Brooks ' 2,000-Year-Old Man . <P> His wonder years in Long Beach , on Long Island , N.Y .  --  the loud relatives , the overtanned mah-jongg ladies at the swimming pool , the horseradish and stuffed cabbage , the vacations in the Catskills  --  are at the heart of his new movie , Mr. Saturday Night , which he wrote , directed , produced and starred in , quite an achievement for someone who did n't know what a key grip was seven years ago . Crystal set out to portray someone who embodied the idols of his youth  --  Milton Berle , Jack E. Leonard , Alan King  --  yet exuded the fear of failure that makes some comics do themselves in , onstage and personally , instead of waiting for life to do it to them . <P> Crystal says he is not Buddy , although he makes him so instantly recognizable in his Nipsey Russell loungewear and pinkie ring , in his scathing put-downs and maudlin sentimentality , that the character seems to come from the inside out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorist inside each of us , who can ruin things at any moment . " But like many people for whom affection comes easily , Crystal may have felt driven to test his positives . " It was easy to like Harry ( ( in When Harry Met Sally . . . ) ) and Mitch ( ( the mid-life ad guy in City Slickers ) ) , but not Buddy . I wanted to elicit the complex affection for someone who does rotten things but who is not a rotten man . " <P> It may only have been possible for Crystal to portray this wrinkled , self- absorbed baby with a cigar once he was safely beyond such a fate himself . At 44 , he is now at the top not only professionally  --  considered in the same breath with Steve Martin and Robin Williams  --  but personally as well , uncommonly secure in a business where ego tremors routinely register 9.8 on the Richter scale . He has lived in the same house in Pacific Palisades , Calif. , for 12 years , been married to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volleyball game of either daughter : Jennifer , 19 , who is now studying acting in London ; and Lindsay , 15 . An exciting Saturday is when his good friends , director Rob Reiner and his wife , come over , or when he goes to root for Los Angeles ' basketball underdogs , the Clippers . " For a star , " says Reiner , who directed him in Harry , " he 's the most normal man in America . "
