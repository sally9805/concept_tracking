<p> At first glance , news from duck nesting grounds on the northern prairies looks a bit depressing . <p> The number of wetlands in the north-central U.S. and prairie Canada , heart of the continent 's duck production area , dropped by almost 40 percent from a year ago . <p> The number of ducks estimated returning to the surveyed breeding areas this spring was down almost 10 percent from 1997 . <p> But neither of those factoids accurately reflect the state of the mid-continent duck population . Look beyond those one-year changes , and things look very good up north - at least in most cases . <p> For example : <p> This spring 's surveys estimated duck numbers in North Dakota , which produces as many as half the ducks raised in the U.S. and sends a lot of them to Texas each autumn , to be down 23 percent from 1997 . <p> North Dakota mallard numbers fell 21 percent . <p> And the number of wetlands in the state dropped 31 percent from a year ago . <p> " But those ( total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Craig Bihrle of the North Dakota Game and Fish Department . " All those records were set in the last three years . Last year , we had the highest duck numbers in the 50 years the state has done its surveys . " <p> The North Dakota mallard population , while down considerably from a year ago , is still the second highest on record , he said . <p> Even with the drop , that state 's duck population this spring was 112 percent above the long-term ( 1948-97 ) average . <p> The same goes for the number of ponds in the state . <p> A year ago , North Dakota had more wetlands than ever , thanks to three consecutive wet years . And the number of wetlands remains 33 percent above the 50-year average . <p> " It still looks very good for ducks , particularly in some areas , " Bihrle said . <p> That pretty much sums up the mid-continent duck situation - down from a year ago , but still awfully good when compared to the dark days of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what turned out to be an almost decade-long drought on the northern prairies , spring duck breeding populations surveys estimated the mid-continent population to be 22.9 million birds . <p> It got even worse the next year , when breeding populations dropped to 22.8 million birds . Since such estimates were initiated in 1955 , only 1962 , when the population estimate was 22.1 million birds , saw fewer ducks . <p> This year 's spring breeding population estimate pegs the mid-continent duck population at 39 million birds , down 8 percent from a year ago . But 1997 produced a record spring count of 42.5 million ducks . Except for this past year , this spring 's 39 million ducks is the highest breeding population since 1972 . <p> " There 's a whole lot more good news than bad news , " Brian Sullivan , waterfowl program leader for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department , said of the recently compiled data on the continent 's duck population . <p> Each spring since 1955 , U.S. and Canadian biologists have surveyed the heart of the continent 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Canada and into the sub-arctic , counting ducks and wetlands , coming up with estimates of overall populations , species populations and habitat conditions . <p> That information is compiled , compared and disseminated in an annual administrative report . <p> This year 's report - Trends in Duck Breeding Populations , 1955-98 - was issued earlier this month and gives waterfowlers and other interested in the birds insight into current status of one of the continent 's most important and dynamic wildlife resources and its northern habitat . <p> As mentioned , total number of the 10 most-common species of ducks in the traditionally surveyed areas was estimated at 39 million , down 8 percent from 1997 's record estimate . <p> But the 1955-98 average breeding population is 32.6 million , meaning this year 's population is 20 percent above the long-term average . <p> Only two species posted breeding population increases from a year ago . Blue-winged teal were up 4 percent , to 6.39 million , and redheads were up 9 percent to a little over 1 million birds . <p> " Its the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a million , " Sullivan said . <p> All of the eight remaining species surveyed posted declines in populations from 1997 levels . Most of those declines were slight - mallards down 3 percent , gadwall down 4 percent , wigeon down 8 percent , canvasbacks unchanged from a year ago . <p> But there were considerable drops in some species from 1997 . Green-winged teal fell 17 percent . Shovelers dropped 23 percent . Scaup numbers slipped 16 percent . <p> But the most concerning decline involved pintails . <p> Pintails , once one of the three most populous ducks in North America ( along with mallards and scaup ) , declined 29 percent in breeding population over 1997 numbers . <p> Even with the declines this year , the breeding population of all but two of the 10 most common ducks remains well above long-term averages . But pintails are one of those two troubled species . <p> From a breeding population of as much as 10 million in the 1950s , pintail numbers declined through the ' 60s , stabilized at about 6 million during the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1980s . <p> Pintail numbers hit rock bottom in 1991 when the breeding population was estimated at 1.8 million birds . <p> When water returned to the prairies in the mid-1990s , waterfowl biologists hoped pintails would respond to the improved conditions . <p> They did . But not nearly as well as other species . Pintail numbers struggled to improve while populations of most other ducks exploded . <p> This year , pintail numbers fell to 2.5 million , and the stunning 29 percent drop from a year ago leaves the species 43 percent below its long-term average of 4.4 million . <p> " I 'm really surprised at the pintail numbers , " Sullivan said . " A lot of people are looking hard , trying to understand what 's happening with that bird . " <p> Most waterfowl biologists say they believe the pintails ' decline is related to several factors . But one - the species ' proclivity to gravitate to " sheet water " during the bird 's nesting process - seems to loom large this year . <p> Sheet water - or temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas - used by pintails is most often produced by melting snow and spring rain . This year , in much of the northern prairie , sheet water was in short supply . <p> This May 's pond count . the annual survey of wetlands in duck nesting country of the north-central U.S. and prairie Canada , showed a 38 percent decline in pond numbers from a year ago . <p> The largest declines were in prairie Canada where pond counts in southern portions of Saskatchewan , Manitoba and Alberta were half what they were a year ago and 27 percent below the long-term average . <p> Most of that decline was in the number of temporary wetlands - sheet water - that are so important to pintails . <p> " Those ephemeral wetlands were lost in many areas , " Sullivan said . <p> The result of that lack of temporary wetlands could mean that pintail production is down this year , adding to the species ' problem . <p> We 'll know in a couple of weeks . <p> Brood surveys in major duck production areas began this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By the first week of August , federal waterfowl authorities will crunch the data - habitat conditions , brood counts , etc. - and release the annual " fall flight forecast , " a rough estimate of the number of ducks headed south this autumn . <p> With habitat conditions about average , overall , ducks probably will see normal brood success , meaning the total duck population is likely to double from spring breeding population estimates . <p> If that happens , a fall flight of about 80 million ducks could be headed south . <p> That would n't be as high as last year 's 90-million-plus fall flight forecast . But considering that as few as 50 million ducks headed south earlier this decade , 80 million ducks would look very , very good .
