<p> NEW YORK  --  Corporate America 's addiction to poison pills and other antitakeover tonics is beginning to raise the ire of shareholders . <p> Triggered in part by long-running hostile takeover battles for control of underperforming companies such as ITT and Pennzoil , there is growing frustration with company directors who " Just Say No " to predators without taking concrete steps to appease investors . <p> " At least ITT has adopted a plan to try to increase shareholder value . Pennzoil has done nothing but build a moat around the castle , " says Tom Burnett of Mergers Insight , an independent newsletter that caters to institutional investors . <p> Besieged boards are able to dig in their heels thanks to the advent , little over a decade ago , of the poison pill , or shareholder rights plan . Usually adopted by boards without shareholder approval , a pill makes hostile bids prohibitively expensive by enabling the target company to issue new shares to existing holders . <p> As a result , ITT can ignore Hilton 's $ 11.5 billion hostile bid , opting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . Pennzoil can tell Union Pacific Resources its $ 6.4 billion offer is too cheap and anyway it has a long-term ( so far secret ) strategy for growth . And New York State Electric and Gas can defeat CalEnergy 's $ 3.3 billion unsolicited overture . And all of that can be done without consulting shareholders , many of whom would have embraced the hostile bids had they had the chance . <p> " You are going to see much more shareholder protest in the months ahead , " warns Nell Minow of Washington-based activist money manager Lens Inc . " Poison pills will be an issue . " <p> But Wall Street lawyers and bankers are quick to point to plenty of evidence that suggests pills actually enhance shareholder value rather than erode it  --  by buying valuable time . <p> " Poison pills give the target company the time to develop strategic alternatives , including finding a competing bidder , " says Robert Kindler , a partner with law firm Cravath Swaine &; Moore . <p> A case in point occurred earlier this year when H.F. Ahmanson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $ 6.6 billion hostile bid . Thanks to a pill , Great Western advisers Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs had time to find a white knight in the winning $ 7.9 billion offer from Washington Mutual . <p> " Shareholder rights plans , thoughtfully administered , are a great friend of shareholder value , " says Steven Heller , head of mergers and acquisitions ( M &A); for Goldman . <p> To pill or not to pill <p> Research firm Securities Data says more than 1,514 U.S. companies have pills , one in five of which expire this year , and a further 40% next year . Should CEOs heed Wall Street advisers and renew the pills ? <p> There is little doubt that M &A; has become more sophisticated since the choppers-at-dawn , junk-financed raids that symbolized the 1980s . But pills have helped ensure that unsolicited bids are not only rarer , but also more likely to end in tears for the bidder . <p> Only 66% of hostile bids succeed today , compared with a rate of almost 80% as little as four years ago . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of directors , supermajority voting requirements and liberal provisions allowing stock issues or repurchases , and companies can be virtually untouchable . ( See glossary . ) The criticism <p> Many economists and institutional investors argue that making companies takeover-proof allows incompetent executives to remain fat , lazy and indifferent , as long as they have a vague long-term strategy tucked away in their top drawer . Pills can encourage entrenched management and discourage legitimate offers . <p> Even chief executives with pills on their books are getting fed up with the " Just Say No " defense . " It 's too much of a good thing , " says Hilton CEO Stephen Bollenbach . " Basically , companies like ITT are saying to their shareholders , ' if you do n't like it , sell your stock . You thought you had a vote , well you do n't . ' " <p> Reformers want pills with sunset provisions of two or three years , rather than the typical 10 , and qualifying clauses that permit shareholders to vote to redeem or eliminate the pill in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would put arbitrageurs  --  investors who trade strictly on takeover speculation  --  and other savvy shareholders in the driver 's seat at the expense of the long-term interests of a company and its other shareholders . <p> " A rights plan allows the board to exercise business judgment on behalf of the interests of all shareholders , " says Gary Parr , co-head of M &A; for Morgan Stanley . <p> At any rate , defenders of the status quo say today 's better-organized shareholders have the power to make management listen , regardless of the type of pill they have . <p> " As a director , you do n't wait until you 're the last man in the bunker , " says Columbia law professor John Coffee . " Very few of these contests play out to the last inning once it becomes clear that shareholders are against you . Either management adopts a strategy aimed at raising the share price above the tender offer , as ITT is trying to do , or else you enter into serious negotiations . " <p> Pills are n't necessarily bad <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takeover premiums  --  the gap between acquiring firms ' final offers and targets ' pre-bid share prices  --  shows that of 300 U.S. transactions looked at between 1993 and 1997 , firms with a pill in place carried premiums 10% higher than companies without . <p> Pills have also put an end to front-end loaded , two-tiered , bust-up tender offers seen in the early 1980s when bad guys and buccaneers would buy a majority stake at a premium and leave the remaining shareholders high and dry . <p> Most companies that fight unsolicited takeover attempts claim they have superior strategies to increase shareholder value . Sometimes they do , as in Wallace Computer Services ' successful defense against the $ 1.3 billion hostile bid by Moore of Toronto in 1995 . Since then , Wallace shares have gained more than 100% . <p> Sometimes they do n't . Witness American Standard 's rejection in January of the $ 4 billion Tyco International offer . American Standard 's stock closed Friday at $ 40 , below the $ 431/4 it was trading at when Tyco 's $ 50-a-share bid was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive , unsolicited bid , as in the case of IBM going for Lotus two years ago , it is pretty difficult to ignore , says David Heleniak , a lawyer with Shearman &; Sterling , citing the " country club effect . " <p> " If a hostile bid develops at a 20% to 30% premium , and the board says no thanks , those guys have to go back to their country clubs and look their friends in the eye , " Heleniak says . <p> The pill 's roots <p> Martin Lipton of law firm Wachtell Lipton was the architect of the modern-day poison pill in 1984 and it was first adopted by Crown Zell-er-bach , a forestry-products company . <p> Known as a " flip-over , " the pill gave the shareholders of an acquired firm the right to buy shares in the combined entity at a big discount ( typically 50% ) , diluting any gain to the bidder . The idea was to protect shareholders from low offers . <p> After the Delaware Supreme Court upheld the use of poison pills in 1985 , pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since . <p> Bill Patterson of the AFL-CIO investment office admits poison pills are n't inherently evil . <p> " The issue is the right of shareholders to vote on poison pills and not the poison pills themselves , " Patterson says . " In many cases , where a company is performing well , shareholders would likely support a pill . It 's the democracy and accountability of companies that 's at stake . " <p> Patterson and others are worried that some firms are getting carried away with building defenses . <p> Last month , the federal court in Atlanta dealt a blow to Invacare 's $ 190 million hostile bid for Healthdyne Technologies when it upheld Healthdyne 's " deadhand " poison pill , a controversial antitakeover measure that seems to be gaining in popularity . <p> While a typical pill might expire after 10 years , deadhand pills have " continuing directors " provisions that explicitly give the directors who installed the pill or their handpicked successors the authority to remove the pill . <p> That essentially gives fiduciary rights to those individual directors even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While the Atlanta decision surprised many , legal scholars say the deadhand pill wo n't stand if tested in Delaware , where about half of the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange are incorporated . <p> New York , the only other jurisdiction to rule , threw out the deadhand pill in a case involving Irving Bank in 1988 , paving the way for a takeover by Bank of New York . <p> Palatable option <p> Shareholder rights groups would like to see a pill ( there are many variations ) with less venom adopted by America 's captains of industry , something widely referred to as " the chewable pill . " <p> Common in Canada but rare in the USA , the chewable pill is installed by shareholder vote and can be redeemed by shareholder vote . Proponents say it is a fine example of democracy in action . <p> Detractors argue a chewable pill can be manipulated by sophisticated shareholders at the expense of others . <p> Try telling that to shareholders of chronic underperformers . <p> Shark repellent <p> Tools corporate boards use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adopted by a board of directors , a poison pill automatically allows a target company to issue shares to existing shareholders at a substantial discount , typically 50% , when a hostile bid has been made . By suddenly having more shares outstanding , it makes it more expensive and difficult for the bidder to takeover the company . <p> Staggered elections of directors . By staggering the election dates for board members , it becomes more difficult for the potential buyer to take control of the board in a proxy fight . <p> Supermajority voting . This requires changes to be approved by more than a simple majority of shareholders . It 's used to do everything from approving a business combination to amending charter bylaws . <p> Fair price . This provision compels a potential buyer to pay all shareholders the highest price it pays to any one shareholder over a specific time period . <p> Stock repurchases or new issues . Boards adopt provisions that give the company wide flexibility in issuing new shares or buying back stock .
