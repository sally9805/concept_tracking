YEVGENI SLAVUTIN Director " The whole world is about to perish , and you sound like you want to drink tea ! " shouts director Yevgeni Slavutin , 44 . He is taking two actresses through the crucial scene in an existentialist drama , where a chance encounter between a city woman and a peasant turns into a test of strength that will decide the fate of the universe . Viewers must believe , he says , that this morality play is " their own story . " Slavutin 's Student Theater at Moscow State University has dramatized the most tumultuous events of the Soviet demise in the language of vaudeville sketches . His success in turning the grit and grime into lyrical parables of universal meaning has attracted a dedicated following . " This is a theater of hope , " he says , " not of dead ends . " <P> VLADIMIR IVANYUSHKIN Farmer As the 43-year-old farmer proudly surveys his freshly painted beehives and rabbit hutches , architects are reviewing plans to restore the village church , lately a warehouse . " It will cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's important . It 's not just the farm we want to restore here , it 's the tradition . " The village of Staroye Leskovo , 180 miles from Moscow , was once the estate of an old Russian noble family managed by Ivanyushkin 's grandfather , famous for its Thoroughbred racing horses . Seventy years of Soviet control laid waste to the estate , and his grandsons are determined to restore it , even though they still can only rent the land . " We 'll turn this place into a high-class modern facility , " vows Ivanyushkin . " Soon it will be our property for keeps . " <P> VLADIMIR ZAKHAROV Church Elder In the Church of St. Sergei a seven-year-old boy tilts his head as a priest snips off a lock of his hair and dips it in a cistern of holy water . The boy and six others have just been baptized . Vladimir Zakharov proudly watches the service . Though not a priest , Zakharov , 46 , is an elder at St. Sergei 's who oversees the Russian Orthodox Church 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the new parishioners do not come solely for spiritual sustenance . Many are poor , and they look to St. Sergei 's for practical help from the Moscow patriarchate 's new charity programs , funded largely by churches abroad . " Charity brings the church closer to the people , " says Zakharov . " In return , the people learn about God for the first time . " <P> ANATOLI BERESLOV Neurologist The young boy 's weary eyes light up the moment Anatoli Bereslov , director of Moscow 's first cerebral palsy rehabilitation center , approaches the teenager 's bed . " You look well , my young one , " he says . The compliment motivates the boy to sit up , despite his pain . Bereslov , a former professor of neurology , has inspired many such acts of courage since he became director of the center , opened 21 months ago . His respect for his patients and unpretentious attitude are the best therapy . Doctors with such convictions are rare in Russia 's crumbling national health system . " When I first came here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , I was going to serve them , just as I serve God , " says the doctor , 54 . " I take their problems on as my personal pain . "
