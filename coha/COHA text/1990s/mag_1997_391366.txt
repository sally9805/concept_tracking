Doctors and women are falling back in love with a trio of birth-control methods that have been plagued by bad press . Find out why these easy , nearly fail-proof options should now be at the top of your shopping list . By Hallie Levine // Tired of having to think so much about your birth control-ither on the big night or the morning after ? Especially if you 're in a monogas relationship , talk to your doctor about the following three options , all newly improved and receiving raves from physicians . Most Undated Easy Birth Control  --  the IUD ( Intrauterine Device ) If you 're looking for a birth-control method with a next-to-nothing failure rate that you probably have n't tried , consider the IUD . It 's the world 's most popular reversible method of female contraception , with nearly 90 million users . " Today 's IUDs are safe , effective , and a relatively hassle-free method of birth control , " stresses Mitchell Creinin , M.D. , director of family-planning research at the University of Pittsbugh School of Medicine . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your uterus , the IUD causes an inflammatory respnse , creating an influx of white blood cells that kill off egg-seeking sperm . Effectiveness : Two out of 100 women will get pregnant within a year of insertion , but the number decreases with each year of use ( perhaps due to the continuing inflammatory action , doctors speculate ) . History : Despite its stellar effectiveness , the IUD is used by only 1 percent of American women . Why ? Probably because of the bad rap it got in teh early ' 70s , when one version , the Dalkon Shield , was linked to at least 12 deaths and tens of thousands of cases of pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) before being pulled from the American market . " The Dalkon IUD was n't subjected to the rigorous testing now required fro FDA approval , " explains Hilda Hutcherson , M.D. , assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at New York City 's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center , " and some doctors now therorize that the braided string on the Dalkon Shield drew bacteria up into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IUD have nonbraided nylon strings with no spaces or holes for bateria to climb up . ) " The most recent studies released by the Centers for Disease Control reveal that woman who use today 's IUDs are no more at risk for PID than are women in the general population , " stresses David F. Archer , M.D. , director of the Woman 's Health Center at the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School . Availability : There are currently two types on the market in the United States . The Copper T-380A- also known as the ParaGuard-has been available since 1984 and is effective for up to 10 years . The Progestasert , available since 1972 , needs to be replaced about once a year because of its daily release of the synthetic hormone progestrone . " Both IUD have their pros and cons , " explain Dr. Creinin . " The ParaGuard minimizes your risk of infection during insertion because you only have to replace it every 10 years , but the progesterone in the Prgestasert can significantly reduce cramping and bleeding otherwise associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Progestasert and $160 for the ParaGuard . Insertion fees can add another $160 to $400 . Downside : Experts say if you 're not in a monogamous relationship , the IUD is not the best form of birth control because it does n't protect you against sexually transmitted diseases . IUDs may also cause mild cramping , pain , and extra bleeding the first several months after insertion . And a woman who has never had children may have slightly higher chance of expelling the device through uterine contractions than does a woman whose uterus has already been streacthed by childbirth . " Still , the more skilled the doctor is in inserting an IUD , the less likely your risk of wxpulsion , " says Dr. Creinin . Where to go : Insertion into your uterus is done in a doctor 's office . But many doctors are still wary about inserting them because of lawsuites of twp decades ago . " Some doctors also are reluctant to insert them in woman who are unmarried , because they 're concerned that such women may not be in mutually monogamous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contraceptive research at the University of California in San Francisco . " They 're mistakenly afraid a woman will contact a PID and blame it on the IUD , although all the data today show no link between the two . " So you may have to do some shopping around before finding a gynecologist willing to work with you . The physican you finally choose should have experience and training in inserting IUDs . User-friendly comment : " I have had the ParaGuard IUD for a year and a half now . I wanted an effective method of birth control that did n't involve synthtix hormones  --  my mother died of breast cancer , and even though all the latest studies show no link between hormonal methods of birth control the Pill , Norplant , DepoProvera and cancer , emotionally , I just did n't feel comfortable . There was some very mild cramping during the insertion procedure , but other than that , I have n't had any side effects . It 's been great . "  --  Nikki Kline* , 29 , nurse , Los Angles Photograph Dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . //  --  Birth-Control Implant  --  Norplant Do you like the Pill but forget to tke it every day ? The hormonal implant Norplant is so low-maintenance , it only requires one trip to the doctor every five years . " It 's perfect for woman who wants foolproof method of contraception but does n't want the hassle of thinking about it every day , " says Dr. Archer How it works : Norplant is a set of six matchstick-size hormone-containing capsules made od silicone-based tubing that are inserted just beneth the skin of your upper inner arm ( and usually are not visible unlwss you flex your arm ) . Starting 24 hours after the capsules are in place , you 're protected from pregnancy by a progestin called levonorgestrel , which is slowly released out of each capsule . Effectiveness : Norplant has a failure of less than 1 percent . If you want to continue with Norplant , it . important to have the capsules replaced at the five-year mark . If you want to get pregnant , you - an have them removed at any time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than one million American women have had insertions since Norplants FDA approval in 1990 , and Norplant has been used safely in other countries since the early 80s . Unfortunately , lawsuits lodged against Norplant 's manufacturer , Wyeth-Ayerst , involving possible side effects and discomfort during removal have scared many women away " These suits are a sad story in women 's health , " comments Elizabeth Connell , M.D. , professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta . " They 're fueled in large part by lawyers eager to get cash settlements and have created a slew of misconceptions about a birth-control method that countless government studies have deemed safe . " Indeed , many of these ca.ses have been thrown out of court , tmd in 1995 , the FDA reaffirmed its position that Norplant is both safe and effective . Cost About $335 for the system , $100 for insertion , and $200 to $500 for removal Downside : You can expect tenderness and some bruising at the insertion site for a couple of days . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ und removal easier , will be on the market within two years , sund scientists are now working on a single-rod system . ) Some 70 percent of women will experience irregular periods or spotting witin the first year after insertion , and about 5 percent will have other side effects , such as breast tenderness , heaches , mood savings , and weight gain Where to go : Insertion is done in a doctors office under local mesthesia . " To reduce the risk of scar tissue fonning , make sure the procedure is performed by a trained in the process , " advises Klaisle . User-friendly comment : " I went on Norplant because I had two kids and wanted a method of birth control that was virtuially foolproof . I also like the fact that Norplant puts the barest amolmt of hormone in your body And I 've had no side effects , save for the occasional heasy period . " - Shelby Raul , 35 , housewife , Atlanta Birth-Control Shot-Depro-Provera If you 're forgetful about taking a pill every day but do n't mind remembering an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of birth control works well for the woman who ants an effective method of contraception but is n't sure if she wants one as long-term as Norplant or the IUD , " explains Klaisle . How it works : Depro-Provera contains the synthetic hormone **25;228;TOOLONG acetate ( DMPA ) , whixh is injected into your arm or buttock every 90 days . It provides protection frrom preganancy within 24 hours of the intial injection . Effectiveness : Approximately three out of a thousand woman on Depro-Provera get pregnant during a year of use . History : DMPA has been around as a treatment for endometrical cancer since the early 1970s , but it took nearly 20 yars to get approval for the drug as a contracaptive . " The FDA was concerned about Depro-Provera 's safety and efficay and wanted extensive studies to be done on it exclusively as a contraceptive before approving it , " explains Dr. Creinin . Cost : Approximately $30 to $40 per shot Downside : Nuisance side effects , such as breakthrough bleeding and weight gain . " As you continue using Depro-Provera , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discountinuing treatment , " says Dr. Creinin . But unlike Norplant or the IUD , whose contraceptive effects are reversed immeditely after removal , you 'll have to wait for the shot to wear off before your fertility resumes . Where to go : Your gynecologist 's office or your local reproductive-health clinic User-friendly comment : " I went on DepoProvera my seniior year in college because I had a serious boyfriend but kept forgetting to take the Pill .
