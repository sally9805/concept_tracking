HOW THE 1996 INC. 500 WERE SELECTED <p> Companies must have been independent and privately held through 1995 , must have had at least $200,000 in base-year sales , and must have shown a sales increase from 1994 to 1995 .

The 1996 Inc. 500 list was prepared under the direction of editorial information manager Beth Gunn . 11 , 430 My Brother , Myself <p> Aspect Development and Mastech <p> When Romesh Wadhwani , chairman and CEO of Aspect Development , needs advice about managing growth , he turns to his brother , Sunil , CEO of Mastech .

At 16 he started a fantasy roleplaying magazine with his older brother and two friends . The four made a pact in pencil : their respective ownership stakes would be based on the level of work each did . When the two friends bowed out , they gave up their equity stakes , as Wieck did when he went to college . But Wieck later returned , and he now serves as CEO . The 26-year-old holds no equity , but he insists he 's not being taken advantage of by his big brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums of money , " he says . 58 Looks Are n't Everything <p> Michael Stopka , Design Toscano <p> " Sure , people look at us funny because we sell gargoyles . For the first two years , the bank was hesitant . Bankers said , ' Great growth , but you sell ... gargoyles ? ' Our first store opened in a typical suburban community . People from the Baskin Robbins next door walk by , shake their heads , and say , ' How can a place like this stay open ? ' They do n't realize there are a lot of workers here , bringing in sales of about $10 million . " 75 Another Thing Kid : There 's No Such Thing As a Free Lunch <p> George P. Birdsong III , Systems Partners <p> " Our company grew pretty fast , but we were just making payroll , and to do that we dinged every credit card we had . One day my sons were on their way to school , and they said , Dad , we need some lunch money . ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this must be what it feels like to be a real entrepreneur , because I really could n't go anywhere to even get a buck . The banks would n't talk to me .

' " 112 The Laser 's Edge <p> Cynosure <p> Forget about applying for a patent because you 're worried about somebody else stealing your brainchild . Here 's the real reason to do it : so you 'll know how to get around the patent . That skill came in handy when Horace Furumoto fell out of favor with the board of Candela , the scientific-laser company he 'd founded in 1970 , and began looking for a new job in 1991 . He started Cynosure to compete against Candela with a similar product  --  a medical laser to remove birthmarks . Although Candela retained the rights to the original laser , " it was my patent , and I knew it inside and out , " Furumoto says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of costly litigation .

A cable channel devoted to various styles of dance  --  from Fred Astaire to flamenco , from the mambo to the macarena . <p> The Rationale : Everyone loves dancing , but not everyone loves the writhing torsos of MTV 's The Grind . <p> Reality Check : There 's a reason the only dance you see on TV is on PBS. 155 Hog Wild <p> Preferred Payment Systems <p> Want a job with Preferred Payment Systems ? Try riding in on a Harley . Five of the company 's seven partners have hogs and participate in cross-country rallies in full leather-and-chaps regalia . In fact , notes president Steve Nelson , " we hired our top database director at one rally .

The buyers wanted only one other principal besides Larry , one of the original partners . So it was between Jim and me .

" 245 Sixty Degrees of Separation <p> Computer Free America <p> Here 's how to eliminate distractions so you can write that brilliant business plan : Tony Cooper , cofounder of Computer Free America , holed up in a tent for eight weeks in Antarctica . Ostensibly , he was helping a friend , do meteorological analysis . " But it took about a week and a half to set up and a week and a half to break down , so that left us five weeks to plan , " recalls Cooper . Five hundred miles from anywhere , the two depended on Radio Free Europe , whose name they modified for their business . 251 Booth Toll <p> Robert Cooney , Laser Storm <p> " In year two , our laser-tag business was struggling .

" 291 Disco , Duck ! <p> SIGS Publications <p> No doubt Richard Friedman still has to hustle every day , but he probably does n't do the hustle the way he used to . Before launching SIGS Publications , Friedman produced disco dance contests in the late 1970s , complete with mirrored balls and platform shoes . Friedman was approached about putting the contests on TV but did n't think they 'd translate . He relinquished the concept to **27;4007;TOOLONG Merv Griffin , and the rest is pop-culture history : the show , Dance Fever , ran for nine seasons . 299 The Big Chill <p> General Shelters of Texas S.B. <p> Forget Troy Aikman .

The Port-A-Cool ( using technology originally developed to cool hog enclosures and henhouses ) works like a giant air conditioner : players sit beside it to cool down .

But massage has n't reached critical mass , because the masses tend to be so critical of it : either they recoil at the back-alley connotations , or they find the price inflexibly high . A national chain with a brand-name approach could rub folks the right way by both legitimizing massage therapy and cutting the average price of a one-hour massage in half . <p> Reality Check : What if people like the back-alley connotations ? 353 Starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co . <p> " About the time my husband , Jack , left his previous position , he developed a potentially deadly skin cancer . Because he was 60 , no one would hire him . So we started an environmental consultancy , set up under my name . I was also teaching 25 violin , viola , and piano students each week . That gave us our ' eating money , ' and I did it for about five years . Recently , I let my last two students go . I love my teaching , but the business comes first .

The carts would also offer topographical information for any green . <p> The Rationale : As baby boomers start to retire , golf will become even hotter . The carts would up the pleasure factor . <p> Reality Check : What 's next ?

Three are on this page : Lai , Venuti &; Lai ; Ameristar Technologies ; and Saturn Electronics &; Engineering . The fourth , Telamon , appears earlier at #248. 434 Beyond a Reasonable Doubt <p> Grrind King <p> When Donald Cassel of Grind King went thumbing through the yellow pages trying to find a manufacturer for a new skateboard part he wanted to develop , he was n't necessarily looking for a business education .

It turned out Barbour was a three-time Inc. 500 alumnus ( #365 in 1987 , #489 in 1988 , and #428 in 1989 ) , and in addition to knowing something about manufacturing , he also knew plenty about fast growth . Barbour helped Cassel improve the design of his invention and work out manufacturing techniques . He also gave Cassel business advice on everything from finance to ethics . " Bob taught me that honoring debts pays off in the long run , " says Cassel . At one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product . " I thought he should give me a break , " says Cassel , " but he explained how he had had to take a out a loan to provide me with that product .

Day , Rockies Brewing , and Tony Silva , Corporate Systems Group <p> The Concept : Franchised cigar boutiques . Customers would select from different tobacco leaves , and the store would hand-roll custom cigars . <p> The Rationale : There 's a renewed interest in cigars , and not just among men : chomping on a stogie is no longer seen as unladylike . What 's more , highly bankable celebrities like he-man Arnold Schwarzenegger and supermodel Linda Evangelista have puffed quite publicly . <p> Reality Check : They still stink . 485 While You 're Reading This , He 's Starting Anether Business <p> Woodstock International <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't help myself , " pleads Shiraz Balolia . Maybe that 's why Balolia runs 11 companies in addition to Woodstock International , a wholesale distributor of woodworking tools . The Kenyan-born entrepreneur 's enterprises range from cutlery to jewelry to sculpture to real estate development . Some of his start-ups are closely related . To gain an edge on his fellow cutlery retailers , Balolia started Grizzly Knife &; Tackle , a wholesaler-which supplies products to retailers .
