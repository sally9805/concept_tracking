" There is no function of any kind on the part of B.C.C.I. I know of no present relationship . I know of no planned future relationship . " <P>  --  Clark Clifford , 1981 <P> Those words must have long haunted the former Defense Secretary , but never more so than when he resigned under pressure last week as chairman of First American Bankshares , Washington 's largest bank holding company . A decade ago regulators , relying on Clifford , permitted a group of Middle Eastern investors to acquire First American . Those purchasers , however , turned out to be alleged fronts for the notorious Bank of Credit &; Commerce International , the criminal enterprise that collapsed in July with an estimated $10 billion in losses . First American 's secret ownership demonstrated B.C.C.I. 's knack for infiltrating power elites even as it served as a cash conduit for terrorists , gunrunners and drug thugs . <P> The departure of Clifford , a venerated Democratic Party elder , and bank president Robert Altman , who also resigned , came after intense prodding by the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public confidence in First American ( assets : $11 billion ) , which has been plagued by troubled real estate loans in the Washington area . Last spring the Fed tapped former Republican Senator Charles Mathias of Maryland to head a committee of directors to oversee First American . While Clifford , 84 , and law partner Altman , 44 , retained their titles , investigators told TIME that the Mathias group gradually took over their duties . " It started to get nasty , " said a federal investigator close to the power struggle . <P> By then the Federal Reserve , which last month fined B.C.C.I. $200 million for secretly acquiring First American and two other U.S. banking companies , had decided that Clifford and Altman had to go . To shore up the bank , regulators picked former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach to succeed his longtime friend Clifford as chairman . <P> Clifford and Altman still face a daunting battery of probes . Grand juries in Washington and New York City are studying how much both men knew about B.C.C.I. 's secret ownership of First American . Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Clifford and Altman reaped a combined $10 million profit after buying stock in a B.C.C.I. affiliate . The two had borrowed $18 million from B.C.C.I. to acquire the stock , which they held for less than two years . TIME 's sources say investigators are probing whether the $10 million profit was a payoff for First American 's 1987 purchase of the National Bank of Georgia for some $200 million from B.C.C.I. front man Ghaith Pharaon . That deal bailed out Pharaon and effectively transferred the $200 million from First American to B.C.C.I. Clifford and Altman deny that they carried out the deal under B.C.C.I. 's orders . <P> Prosecutors are examining other ways in which First American and B.C.C.I. might have been intertwined . Officers at the First American Bank of New York , a subsidiary of the Washington company , funneled financing for international deals to B.C.C.I. , a customer has told TIME . He recalled how " the B.C.C.I. guys suddenly appeared " after several meetings at the New York bank . " When I asked the First American vice president what was going on , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show . "
