A lock of hair , a hospital bracelet  --  parents have often saved items like this to commemorate the birth of a baby . Now some parents are saving something else : the blood from their child 's umbilical cord  --  not for sentimental reasons , but rather because umbilical cord blood contains stem cells , the potentially life-saving building blocks of the immune and blood systems that are also found in bone marrow . Stem cells in cord blood are used to treat serious diseases , like leukemia , neuroblastoma and aplastic anemia , where a bone-marrow transplant once offered the only hope of survival . Cord blood is an attractive alternative to bone marrow for several reasons . If a bone-marrow transplant is required it can take a long time to find a match , and 60 percent of the time the search is unsuccessful . Being a donor is also time-consuming and painful . Moreover , even though the treatment is often successful , rejection of donor cells by the recipient remains a serious and potentially fatal complication .

( You will be asked a number of medical-history questions beforehand , and there 's a short follow-up a few months after the birth . ) The 50 to 100 mL  --  less than half a cup  --  of blood collected is processed down to about two or three teaspoons of fluid that can be used in a transplant . Like bone marrow , cord-blood stem cells can be successfully transplanted in unrelated but tissue-compatible donors . Most importantly , the rejection rate is much lower than with bone marrow . Stem cells can be stored cryogenically for future use . According to Edmonton physician John Akabutu , present technology allows for five years of storage ; private organizations say they can be stored longer , but no one really knows for sure , he says , since samples have only been stored in Canada since 1996 .

Other parents are donating to Canada 's only public cord-blood bank , located at the University of Alberta . Parents who donate to the public bank surrender all rights to their child 's cord blood except when there is a medical need ( e.g. , a sibling awaiting a bone-marrow transplant or a family history of illness requiring such treatment ) . However , the more parents who donate cord blood , the more likely it is that a match will be found for any particular child in need of a transplant . Private cord-blood banking is costly . Registration , collection and processing fees are $550 to $850 or more and yearly storage fees are $100 to $125 . The Toronto Cord Blood Programme offers its services free to expectant mothers when there is a medical need ( as described above ) . Donating cord blood is free .

Families should make inquiries about cord-blood banking by the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy to allow time for registration , and for the bank to contact your doctor .
