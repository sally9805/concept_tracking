British governments are not exactly unaccustomed to the consequences of despised tax policies . A levy on tea , after all , helped spark the American Revolution . Last week , to save itself from the voters ' wrath , the government of Prime Minister John Major unveiled its alternative to the deeply hated poll tax , the flat-fee assessment that Margaret Thatcher instituted last year to replace property taxes as the means of financing local governments . <P> The poll tax prompted a bloody riot in London , helped bring about Thatcher 's resignation and threatened to unseat the ruling Conservative Party in national elections , which must be held by mid-1992 . Major 's new scheme would assess owners and renters alike on the basis of the value of their dwellings , with a 25% reduction for individuals living alone . The poor will be exempt . <P> The proposal is almost certain to be approved by the House of Commons when it is submitted for a vote in the fall . But not without plenty of bellyaching from the opposition . Labour leader Neil Kinnock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His party favors tax rates that would take into account household income as well as property values .
