<p> MIDDLE-CLASS <p> DREAM FOR ' 92 <p> Editor  --  Sometime early in 1992 , probably between January 6 and Super Bowl Sunday , the Great American Middle Class ( GAMC ) will reluctantly open its eyes and emerge from its 10-year hibernation . Once awake , the GAMC will soon start to ask some very tough questions about the quality of life in the ' 90s . <p> Startled by the massive layoffs , bankruptcies and mortgage foreclosures impacting so many people , the GAMC will want to know the whereabouts of that prosperity promised by the " supply side " disciples from the Reagan era . <p> " We know that Reagan and Bush took care of the oil companies , big business , the defense contractors and the rich , " the GAMC will shout , " but where is our share of the American Dream ? " <p> Soon the bitter truth will settle in : The U.S. economy is in severe recession ( depression ? ) because of the wrongheaded policies of Presidents Reagan and Bush over the past 11 years . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GAMC and the lower classes . <p> Thus informed , the GAMC will revolt en masse against all the snake oil salesmen ( Republican politicians ) who have been selling Reaganomics to an unsuspecting electorate for so long . <p> The GAMC will revive the Democratic Party and will elect its nominee , Governor Bill Clinton , to the presidency . Democrats will also increase their majorities in both houses of Congress . America will be saved . <p> JAMES SPITZ NUER <p> Santa Clara <p> A LONG TRADITION <p> Editor  --  Dear Mr. Buchanan : Your thought on restriction of immigration in order to maintain cultural balance has a long tradition . It harkens back to the time when the motto of the American Firsters everywhere was : " No Irish Need Apply . " <p> Your campaign gives new life to their philosophies . <p> WIL COMMON <p> Redwood City <p> WILSON 'S POWER MOVE <p> Editor  --  Your readers should be aware that Governor Wilson 's so- called " welfare reform " initiative ( Chronicle editorial , December 15 ) does far more than address welfare . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of the Legislature . <p> According to news reports , the initiative would move the governor 's deadline for submitting a budget from January 10 to March 1 and give the governor special budget powers if the budget is not passed and signed by July 1 or is 3 percent out of balance . <p> Under the special powers provision , the governor would be allowed to cut programs not specifically protected by the constitution and to reduce the salaries and benefits of non-union workers . <p> So far , the debate has centered on " welfare reform " provisions that are a good bet at the polls . Of course , dozens of politicians and newspapers have jumped on the " welfare reform " bandwagon . There has been little or no discussion in the media of elements of the plan that fundamentally alter the relationship between the governor and the Legislature . It is often said that the American public is woefully ill informed about government . This helps prove the case . <p> JOHN C. HAYES <p> San Francisco <p> SKEWED REASONING <p> Editor  --  How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Chronicle 's editorial on welfare reform . I had thought this form of mindlessness particular to Kern County . Foolish me . With one U.S. kid in four receiving some form of state aid we should blame the welfare system ? With welfare recipients migrating to a state with livable benefits we should cut their allotments ? This latest reform could be yet another adventure in skewed hierarchical reasoning . <p> I have two degrees , a secondary teaching credential and an AFDC number . My community has taken teachers from old schools to staff new ones , doubled class size , eliminated established programs  --  and the need for instructors . I 'm not being " liberated from a self-perpetuating , enervating dole , " I 'm marginally feeding , clothing , housing myself and my child . My intimacy with this segment of U.S. culture allows me to understand what should be blatantly obvious to all societal strata ; curtailing benefits to the impoverished without acceptable alternatives for education , jobs , child care and low-cost housing will only exacerbate an already precarious economic reality . <p> SUKEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Editor  --  Your editorial , " Governor Tackles Welfare Reform " ( December 15 ) , is an excellent analysis of the problem facing this state and makes a very strong case for welfare reform , as proposed by the governor . Very few will argue that the welfare system can continue indefinitely in its present form without some serious modifications . <p> However , I submit that in focusing attention on the welfare issues alone , neither the governor nor your editorial has addressed the real problem facing this state or the entire nation . In my opinion , the real problem is that the economic engine in this country is badly sputtering and needs immediate attention . The nation 's industrial base is being seriously eroded , and we are losing economic competitiveness in the world marketplace . The annual trade deficit is running to the tune of $ 150 billion . While it is true that many jobs are migrating from California to other states , it is even more true that many more jobs are just disappearing or going overseas . <p> It is obvious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required both by the government and the industry to revitalize the economy of this country . <p> It is unrealistic to expect that all the able-bodied welfare recipients will be able to find gainful employment in a job market that is constantly shrinking . In fact , if the economic malaise of the country is not cured with the utmost expediency more and more able-bodied people who are not employed will end up on the welfare rolls , adding even greater burden to the system . <p> SID GHOSH <p> Crescent City ( Del Norte County ) <p> A HUMANE APPROACH <p> Editor  --  Let 's not go overboard here . Frank Jordan only won by about 6,000 votes . I do n't think that 's enough to make sweeping generalizations about how San Franciscans want to execute a plan to " get rid " of all the homeless people . What about those of us looking for humane alternatives , like affordable housing , medical care and job training programs ? I think we would agree with Art that homelessness is a social problem , not an aesthetic one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month for a mother and her two children really too much to live on ? <p> HEIDI SCHMIDT <p> San Francisco <p> TYPICAL LIBERAL <p> Editor  --  How typical , the liberal columnist Richard Reeves ( Chronicle , December 16 ) . He pontificates on how bad has won over good because Americans do n't want to pay the taxes necessary to solve our welfare problem ; he calls us uncaring . He tells us that his pal Art Agnos saw the homeless as a social problem , but that , according to Agnos , " . . . the voters think they 're an aesthetic problem . " <p> Typical , typical , typical . Only the liberals care , only the liberals have the answer , and the answer always involves raising taxes . And how ironic  --  Eastern Europe , struggling to recover from the damage done by Marxist egalitarian philosophy , while our liberal Democrats continue to insist that this is the way to go . <p> PAUL BURTON <p> San Francisco <p> WONDER OF CHRISTMAS <p> Editor  --  As we rush through the stores in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement in the air . The bright decorations , holiday displays and Christmas music suddenly remind us of the meaning of Christmas . <p> Our gifts celebrate the birthday of an infant , the Christ child , born in Bethlehem nearly 2,000 years ago . Three kings followed a moving star to find Him . They brought Him special gifts . <p> Today , we contribute to the underprivileged with love in Christ 's name . And we exchange gifts with our dear ones , remembering the wonder of Christmas . <p> CARMEN HATCH <p> San Francisco <p> 51 STARS . . . <p> Editor  --  I 'm not opposed to Assemblyman Stan Statham 's proposal to divide California into two states , but has he considered the problem this would create for makers of American flags ? <p> I find it impossible to arrange 51 stars in a pleasing rectangular design . The best I can do is five rows of seven and four rows of four , which looks terrible . <p> CHARLES W. EBBERTS <p> Redding ( Shasta County )
