In the war against AIDS , some of the bravest battles are fought far from laboratories and demonstrations <p> <p> KEN PILOTS HIS SECONDHAND Ford through the streets of Brunswick , Maine , a picturesque college town situated some twenty miles from Kennebunkport . It is July 3rd , 1991 , ten years to the day since the first report of a rare cancer found in forty-one gay men appeared in the New York Times . <p> Ken drags on his cigarette , then looks up at the sign hanging from the rearview mirror , which reads : IT 'S BEEN MONDAY ALL WEEK . If I ca n't laugh about it , ' he says , I 'll go crazy . <p> I mean , I 'm probably thinking about it all the time , ' Ken goes on , but I try not to dwell on it . Unless something reminds me . ' He nods at the cassette deck where James Taylor is just then singing : Hey , babe , the sky 's on fire/I 'm dyyyinnn ' , ai n't I ? /Gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eyebrow , then smiles ruefully . His big Irish face is , for a moment , indistinguishable from the actor John Goodman 's . <p> Except for the slight mucousy rattle at the tail end of his laugh , you 'd never think there was anything wrong with Ken . To look at his solid , chunky build , you certainly would n't guess that he 'd been diagnosed at the age of twenty-one , more than two and a half years ago , as a carrier of the virus that causes AIDS . He is , however , one of the estimated 1 million HIV-infected people in America , and one of the 121 officially reported cases of diagnosed people who live in Maine . In fact , Ken belongs to a far larger group of AIDS patients in Maine . A truer estimate of the state 's infected people is closer to 400 . But because people with HIV are counted only in the state where they are diagnosed , Maine 's statistics do not reflect reality . As is true of most rural states , the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in California , New York and Florida . It is only after people get the bad news that they come home . <p> Although Ken has yet to develop any of the opportunistic infections that signal full-blown AIDS , he has experienced a parade of sicknesses typical of HIV-infected people , ailments that never quite allow him to forget that the virus is multiplying in his cells , dismantling his immune system . <p> He 's heard the good news about his diagnosis : better treatments for the opportunistic infections , antiviral drugs like AZT and the newly approved ddI , both toxic drugs with serious side effects . Attitudes , too , have improved : TV and newspapers no longer refer to AIDS as invariably fatal . ' Ad campaigns are drawing attention to the fact that people carrying HIV can lead productive lives . But Ken is also aware of certain harsh facts : For gay men , the average latency period is ten years from initial infection to the onset of AIDS ; AIDS is still incurable ; and the life expectancy from the onset of opportunistic infections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely to live out his thirties . At twenty-three , he is trying to come to terms with death at an age when his peers are only just beginning to think seriously about their lives . <p> He steers his car onto the military base where he works as a minimum-wage stock clerk . Last year Ken was fired from his better-paying factory job when he told his employers about his medical condition . He filed suit and won a settlement . Basically , ' he says , they learned their lesson . ' And he learned his . Ken 's current employers do n't know he 's HIV positive , and he has no plans to tell them . When he misses work because of doctors ' appointments , he says it 's because of a herniated disk . He also waits until he 's home from work - an extra half-hour longer than recommended - before taking his afternoon dose of AZT . He does n't want his co-workers asking questions . In Maine , where AIDS still seems like something that happens elsewhere , living with the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I went into the military after high school , ' Ken says , swinging his car past the armed guard and into a vast parking lot on the edge of the base 's shopping mall . I had to quit after two weeks of boot camp . Asthma attack . Now I wonder whether it did n't have something to do with being HIV positive . ' He shakes his head . That 's how it is when you 've got this . You never know what 's the disease and what is n't . You get paranoid . With every little cough , you ask , Is this it ? ' ' <p> Ken knows that some HIV-positive people change their lives completely after their diagnosis - adopting holistic-health therapies and macrobiotic diets in order to bolster their compromised immune systems ; turning to religion for spiritual support ; sitting down to write the book or symphony they 'd always dreamed of creating . But since testing positive , Ken has mostly craved the continuity of his old life . If I do all those special things , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will make me sicker quicker and put me right into the grave . ' But at the same time , Ken 's HIV diagnosis has undeniably sparked certain new resolves . For instance , tomorrow morning at 8:30 , he and Philip , his lover , will set out by car on a 2300-mile journey to find his estranged father . Ken and his father have not spoken since he learned of his son 's diagnosis two years ago , and Ken has been saving for the trip since last year . In fact , he has come to the mall today to pick up his last paycheck before his vacation . <p> I do n't know what I 'll do when I see my dad , ' he says , heading back out to the parking lot , a check for $151.36 in his back pocket . But I figure this might be my last chance to . . . to . . . whatever . ' <p> <p> TWO HUNDRED MILES UP THE COAST FROM Brunswick , in the rugged , idyllic part of Maine known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lot of a mall . But he walks at a slower , more gingerly tread than Ken , as if afraid to jar something loose within him . <p> No one can say for sure when Bruce was infected with HIV , but it is clear that he is somewhat further along in the progress of the disease than Ken is . His list of HIV-related ailments is longer and potentially more dangerous . Chronic Fatigue Syndrome has forced him to give up work entirely . He has moved home from Pennsylvania to his parents ' place in Maine , where life is slower , less stressful . His short-term goal is to reclaim enough of his health so that he can go back to work , perhaps even find a place of his own . At least , that 's the scenario his doctor has laid out for him . Bruce is n't so sure it 's going to work out that way . <p> I 've put on weight since moving home , ' he says in a voice flattened by his chronic fatigue , but I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him why he 's so tired is annoying . Lately , his doctor has suggested that the problem is n't only physical ; his exhaustion might be a symptom of depression . The doctor thinks Bruce will start feeling stronger only when he finds a job , starts doing something . But he ca n't find a job until he starts feeling stronger . <p> It 's a Catch-22 , ' Bruce says . And it 's starting to piss me off . ' If he feels too weak to do much more than watch his Star Trek tapes , then whose business is it but his own ? He 's twenty-seven , old enough to make his own decisions . <p> It is July 3rd , and this is Bruce 's first trip out of the house since a bout of pneumonia laid him out for three weeks with a fever of 104 . As a celebration , his mom let him use her credit card at a mall on a stretch of highway in Ellsworth . Walking back to his truck , with a Calvin and Hobbes collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - under his arm , Bruce is feeling for the moment almost cheerful . He tosses the books into the front seat of his truck , a big , high rider with NCC 1500 stenciled on the side ( a nod to the starship Enterprise 's registry number , NCC-1701 ) . He climbs in , lights a Marlboro Menthol , then pulls off onto the highway , which runs like a shimmering ribbon through the shapely green countryside . <p> Bruce is looking forward to getting home to his recliner - a deep , comfortable armchair with a curving back that embraces him with a womblike security . Every time his older brother visits , he criticizes Bruce for sitting in the chair too much . Bruce resents the criticism . One thing I 've noticed about this disease , ' he says . People who do n't have it love to preach to people who do . The thing is , they do n't know what it 's really like . You ca n't generalize about this disease . ' Impatience edges his tone : I try to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types are positive all the time . Having AIDS is like lifting 150 pounds up the side of a mountain . Every now and then , you have to rest . You 're just tired . ' <p> Bruce 's goal , he says , is to find a balance . ' To stay sane , he must visualize a future in which he remains healthy long enough to avail himself of a cure . But he knows that he can not ignore - and thus must prepare for - the other , more likely scenario , the one in which his condition worsens , slips another few notches from the shadow world of HIV into full-blown AIDS . <p> <p> SIX MILES FROM THE CITY OF PORTLAND , IN RURAL southern Maine , Rick wakes just before noon on the morning of July 3rd , feeling nauseous and short of breath . He had a bad night last night ; so bad in fact that the hospital rushed out an IV home-infusion pump and 1000 milliliters of pentamidine , the drug that kills the parasitic protozoa breeding in his lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to full-blown AIDS . At twenty-seven , he is living with his mother and stepfather in their mobile home outside Portland and is fighting off his third bout of Pneumocystis Carinii pneumonia , known as PCP . Until the widespread use of pentamidine , PCP was one of the leading killers of men with AIDS ; many still die from it . <p> Carefully , like an old man , Rick swings his feet off the bed . It feels like one of those days when he 's going to be lucky to get through his shower without having to sit down . He makes his way unsteadily toward the bathroom . On the way , he passes the ceiling-high cabinet that contains boxes of surgical gloves , hypodermic needles , syringes and IV tubing . On a nearby dresser is a box labeled INFECTIOUS WASTE in bright red letters . An IV tree stands at the foot of the bed . <p> It 's frustrating , ' Rick says in a surprisingly clear , strong voice . Just last month I was feeling terrific . I was out shopping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I have n't been able to get better . ' <p> Rick regards himself in the bathroom mirror . He looks surprisingly well for someone hospitalized seventeen times in the last year with opportunistic infections from AIDS . He 's only fifteen pounds under his usual weight ( but at six feet three , he 's always looked like a string bean ) , and hardly anyone would notice the pale , inch-long marks on the sides of his neck - scars from last winter 's surgery that removed his lymph nodes . Nor does he have the tombstones in his eyes - that look of resignation which you see in terminally ill people who have given up . At his age , Rick is n't ready to give up . After a brief bout with self-pity and depression following his diagnosis eighteen months ago , he decided that he would live as long - and as productively - with the disease as possible . And if on a day like today , his goal is as simple as making it out of bed to the couch in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the pill bottles that crowd the bathroom shelves : sleeping pills , antinausea pills , anti-diarrhea pills , sinusitis pills , thrush pills , cytomegalovirus pills . Missing from this array are the antiviral drugs AZT and ddI . Rick 's body can not tolerate their side effects , and he has been forced to battle the virus without them . <p> The worst thing is loneliness , ' he says matter-of-factly . My mother and stepfather both work during the day , so I 'm alone a lot . But otherwise , I 'm not angry or scared or anything like that . There are millions of people out there with AIDS . ' <p> Rick brushes his teeth , then sets out on what seems like a very long journey from his bedroom to the adjoining living room . <p> <p> AFTER PICKING UP HIS PAYCHECK AT THE BASE , Ken drives to McDonald 's for breakfast burritos . His doctor has okayed Ken 's largely fast-food diet , for now , but objects strongly to Ken 's cigarette smoking . I 've switched to ultralights , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> He pulls up to the small bungalow that houses his government-subsidized one-bedroom apartment . Inside , Philip is sitting on the sofa , listening to Rod Stewart 's Gasoline Alley - psyching up for a day at his job at an ice-cream shop on Brunswick 's main drag . <p> At twenty-three , Philip seems to hail from an earlier era - say , 1969 . His shoulder-length hair , parted in the middle , lies in symmetrical wings around his part-Indian features . His wiry frame is encased in a white T-shirt and peg-legged black jeans . Born and raised in a Maine fishing village , Philip is the product of what he describes as a chaotic , broken home that was rife with drug and alcohol abuse . As such , he was like countless other tomcat strays that Ken used to bring home . Usually , Ken got sick of them in a day or two ; often sooner . But Philip was different . Underneath his moody exterior is a sweet and gentle guy . They 've been together almost three years . Their bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship , that both of them were HIV positive . <p> Your mom called , ' Philip says , sauntering in to get a burrito . She wants us to come to dinner tonight . ' <p> It still amazes Ken how accepting his mother is of his relationship with Philip . Ken spent his teens in California and Washington State , trying to hide his gayness from his family by dating girls , going into the military . His first homosexual experience occurred shortly before he graduated from high school . An older man simply approached Ken on the street and asked if he wanted a job and sex . ' ' . <p> Ken was , of course , aware of AIDS . That was 1986 . Rock Hudson had died a year earlier , so there was no claiming ignorance of the disease . Still , Ken had n't considered AIDS a threat . You 're seventeen , ' he says , you 're never going to die . ' Over the next few years , he became acquainted with the local gay bars - like the Underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex . He remembers a brief fad ' for safe sex , but like all fads , it soon died down . There were so many reasons not to use a condom . You ca n't feel anything . They break . It wo n't happen to me . AIDS itself never came up in conversation in the bars . It 's not exactly a party subject , ' Ken says . Then , around Christmas 1988 , he started to feel dragged out . And he had shingles - a painful , scabby rash on his stomach . He thought it was VD . Ken 's doctor suggested an AIDS test . <p> It came back positive . He shut himself away for two weeks , seeing no one except Philip . I could n't decide what was worse , ' Ken says , the disease or telling my family I was gay . I got pretty low . I had no one to turn to . I thought about suicide . ' Unable to bear the pressure any longer , he simply blurted out to his mother : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugged him and cried . The minute he realized she was supportive , he knew he was n't going to kill himself . That was the beginning of living with it . Ken then urged Philip to get an AIDS test as well . Two days later , Philip took the test and soon learned that he , too , was HIV infected . <p> That was almost three years ago . Philip still has yet to show any symptoms . Sometimes he almost forgets that he harbors a virus that causes an incurable disease . But he has Ken as a constant reminder . <p> I 've seen the changes in him , ' Philip says . The night sweats , yeast infections , mood swings , fatigue - and his new forgetfulness . At first , Ken would forget what he did the day before . Nowadays , he often forgets why he walked into a room . He 'll stand there , lost , as if he does n't know where he is . The doctor told Ken that the virus often attacks the brain , eats away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' but it could also be psychosomatic forgetfulness . <p> And then , just last month , Ken 's T-cell count dipped below normal . This is where it starts , ' the doctor said . He put Ken on AZT . The pills were helping Ken 's fatigue , but his dependence on the pills was scary . It made him and Philip realize just how sick Ken really was . Philip has noticed that , in front of other people , Ken acts brave . He even jokes about it - he says he 's looking forward to full-blown AIDS so he can lose some weight . But Philip has seen the other side , the despair . Since starting AZT , Ken has been waking in the middle of the night , screaming . He has nightmares in which he sees bleeding bodies and corpses . <p> Philip has felt the despair himself . He tries not to dwell on it , but it builds up in him slowly , quietly . He 'll go for weeks feeling okay , almost forgetting , but then all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , he just sat on the living-room floor with a Judy Collins album on and cried for hours ; both he and Ken fell apart . That was one of the rare times when they bottomed out simultaneously - usually , and luckily , they balance each others ' highs and lows . Sometimes Philip wonders how anyone faces it alone , without a lover . <p> <p> BRUCE HAS BARELY ARRIVED HOME FROM THE mall , settled into his recliner and opened his Star Trek book when his mother comes into the room . <p> Would you like to go for a walk ? ' she asks . <p> He knows what she 's thinking : She does n't like seeing him in the chair . I 'm too tired , ' he says . <p> Come on , ' she says gently , lightly . It 's so lovely out . ' <p> Okay , ' he says . But we 'll drive part way . ' <p> They take his truck , which Bruce eases along a path through the woods to a clearing . They get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce 's mother points to things on the sides of the path : ferns , a bird , a type of wildflower . But Bruce walks slowly , with his hands in his pockets , his gaze fixed on the ground ahead of him . <p> You know , ' Bruce tells his mother , Dr. Reed still thinks I should go back to work in a month . He wo n't put me on disability . I tried to tell him that I 'm tired , but he does n't listen . ' <p> His fear is that if you get on disability , you wo n't ever go back to work . ' Her tone suggests that they have been over this ground before . <p> That 's none of his business ! ' Bruce says angrily . I 've tried to get jobs here . They turned me down at the Colonial Motor Inn for front-desk work . I ca n't get a job . If Dr. Reed wo n't put me on disability , I 'll find a doctor who will . If I was twelve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' <p> Dr. Reed is trying to look after your best - ' <p> It 's not up to him . A doctor is supposed to look after health . ' <p> But that includes mental health , ' his mother says quietly . Bruce does n't respond . Dr. Reed thinks there is n't enough to . . . stimulate you out here . ' <p> He 's right about that , ' Bruce says . <p> At the shore , Lucy , the family dog , wades in the frigid water , then emerges , a clot of mucus hanging from her nostrils . Bruce bends to wipe it away . <p> Not with your hand ! ' his mother cries . <p> Bruce looks up slowly . I 've got a leaf , ' he says with exaggerated patience . Under his breath he adds , I ca n't live in a bubble . ' <p> No . . . , ' his mother agrees . <p> Bruce 's mom decides to walk home since it 's so beautiful out . On the drive back , alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden church sitting in a small clearing . A weathered sign reads , ALL SOULS BY THE SEA . The church was built in 1910 . Bruce strolls over to the adjoining graveyard and stands on the very spot where he will be buried . For the hell of it , ' Bruce says , I looked up my plot number in the registry . It was sixty-nine . ' He chuckles . That struck me as appropriate . ' <p> He was sixteen the first time he visited a gay-cruising area . A guy immediately offered to take him to bed . My God , ' Bruce had thought , is it this easy ? ' It was . Especially for someone like Bruce , a dirty blond , six-foot teen with a boy-next-door wholesomeness . The first time someone referred to me as chicken , ' he says , I thought it was an insult . ' Between the ages of sixteen and twenty-six , Bruce had an estimated 1100 partners . At one point , he often had five partners in a day , sometimes more . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IQ test had once revealed that he had above-average intelligence , but his college career had been undistinguished , at least partly because he was cruising all the time . He never even finished his degree in computers . Sex eclipsed everything in his life . <p> Around 1982 , when he was eighteen , Bruce heard about a gay plague . ' At first he assumed it was a VD . But by 1986 he had started reading up on the disease . He thought , If what they say is true , then I 've already got it . ' By 1990 , Bruce had moved away from home and was living in Allentown , Pennsylvania , where he had a job in aircraft maintenance . In August he started losing weight . Though he had tested negative for the AIDS virus in November , Bruce began to have difficulty lifting the airplane batteries and tires . He grew weaker . He knew what it must be , but he tried to deny it to himself . By January of 1991 , he could n't stand for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until March that his fears were confirmed . While in the hospital with two forms of pneumonia , cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis , he learned that he was HIV positive . <p> The diagnosis itself was n't so bad , ' Bruce says . But when they told me my T-cell count , it was like being hit in the head with a couple of bricks . ' A normal T-cell count - a measurement of crucial immune-system cells - is between 700 and 1200 . His was 40 . He simply had no resources to fight infections . And sure enough , his body has been deluged , in the last eight months , with an avalanche of bacteriological and parasitic invaders : oral candidiasis - or thrush - which fills his mouth and throat with a reeking , creamy white fungus ; draining diarrhea ; other types of highly unpleasant yeast infections ; an itchy , undiagnosed facial rash ; and anal herpes , which makes going to the bathroom so painful that Bruce nearly passes out from the effort . And he 's impotent now as well . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't go a day without sex , he does n't much care about it anymore . In fact , ' he says , strolling out of the graveyard and back to the car , sometimes the thought of sex kind of disgusts me . ' <p> <p> HAVING WOBBLED UNSTEADILY FROM HIS BEDROOM to the living room , Rick lowers himself slowly onto the couch . He flicks on the TV , searching for something mindless . He leaves it on The Long , Long Trailer , starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz . <p> He 's thinking of phoning the hospital . Dizzy , nauseous , short of breath , he 's convinced that he needs to be readmitted . They released him three days ago , after keeping him there for a week . But with PCP , Rick knows , you should spend twenty-one days in the hospital , minimum . That 's the way they do it in New York . They do n't know what they 're doing here in Maine , ' he says . <p> That he is back here sometimes seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was growing up , blue-collar Maine held little appeal for an ambitious - not to mention openly gay - teenager . Maine is pretty homophobic , ' Rick says . It is n't exactly like New York , where some queen in an orange halter top and purple shorts walks down the street and no one thinks about it . ' He adds , I graduated from high school on a Thursday , and by Saturday I was in New York City with a sublet and a job . ' By the end of the Eighties , Rick was earning $70,000 a year as a sales rep in Manhattan 's garment district . He commuted to work from his apartment in Jersey City , which he shared with his lover . It was everything I wanted , ' he says . <p> But in February 1990 he started losing weight . A cough that had dogged him for weeks was worsening . Living in one of the epicenters of the epidemic , Rick knew what it must be - he had seen friends drop like flies . ' Rick consulted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Pneumocystis Carinii . He was diagnosed with full-blown AIDS and spent nine weeks in the hospital . <p> I went through a period of Why me ? ' ' Rick says , but then I decided to try to live with it and to fight it . ' He returned to full-time work . Unable to tolerate AZT , he tried a holistic approach , spending $800 a month on vitamins , shark's-liver oil , flower grains , heat therapy , magnetic therapy and massage . I would come to work with a Baggie filled with 237 pills , ' he recalls , laughing . I was doing okay . Then I just went kaput . ' Another bout with PCP was followed by cytomegalovirus , which attacked the retina in his right eye . Then Rick learned that he had lung cancer ( which has since gone into remission ) as well as Kaposi 's sarcoma , a once-rare form of cancer that is one of the leading causes of death in AIDS sufferers . The cancer moved into the lymph nodes in his neck , then had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell apart . At first he thought he could handle it , ' Rick says . I was bedridden , and as I got sicker , all these nurses were coming into our home with pumps and needles and IV bags and medicine . He could n't take it after all . He started sleeping on the couch . There was no affection . It was very stressful living with him , and I 'm sure that 's one of the reasons I was so sick for so long . ' Last December , Rick was classified as disabled and quit work . Two months later , he made the difficult but unavoidable decision to move home to Maine . <p> His health immediately improved . He put on twenty pounds and started working three days a week at the AIDS hot line in Portland , as well as lecturing to high-school students about his disease . Through the Merrymeeting AIDS Support Service , in Brunswick , he acquired a buddy - someone to shop and eat at restaurants with . But with this most recent bout of PCP , Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work or go out . The loneliness is worse than any physical pain . Two weeks ago he placed a personal ad in the local gay newspaper . It reads : GWM , PWA , 27 , seeks W/BGM , age 20-35 , HIV or PWA to enjoy honest easygoing relationship . Enjoys music , etc . ' <p> At this point , I could care less about sex , ' Rick says , chuckling . I 'm looking for some companionship , someone that I can laugh with and say , Oh , that 's a funny movie , let 's rent it ! ' ' He shrugs . But I mean , who does n't want that ? ' <p> Just then , his mother arrives home from work . <p> How are you doing ? ' she calls from the kitchen . <p> I 'm thinking about phoning the hospital , ' he says . <p> <p> AFTER SWINGING BY THE ICE-CREAM shop to pick up Philip after work , Ken drives to his mother 's place , where they are expected for dinner . Ken 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bigger place - one that will accommodate Ken and Philip when they become too sick to look after themselves .

' <p> Ken 's stepfather is out of town , but his twenty-five-year-old sister Kimberly is visiting from California . Of everyone in Ken 's family , she took the news of his homosexuality and his HIV infection the worst , he says . Over dinner , when the subject of Ken 's health arises , Kimmy listens for a time in silence , then says briskly : Well , you made your bed , and you 're going to have to sleep in it . It was your decision to be gay and to get AIDS . ' The harshness is mitigated , however , by the tremble in her voice , the tears edging her eyes . Her anger is clearly born of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ken and Philip 's impending trip to find Ken 's real father , who left the family when Ken was seven years old . <p> You always defended him , ' Ken 's mom says .

But Ken is looking down at his plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken one of its sudden swings toward melancholy . Darkness begins to invade the windows .

His mom tried to get him to stick around for dessert , but he wants to get back to his recliner . Star Trek : The Next Generation is about to start . <p> Before turning on the TV , Bruce goes into the kitchen and prepares his evening dose of ddI , stirring the white powder into a glass , which he takes out to the living room . He settles into his recliner . He sips the Tang-like ddI slowly , over the course of the evening , as he watches TV . <p> Bruce has almost all the Star Trek episodes , old and new , taped and carefully filed in the upstairs cabinet that holds his model of the Enterprise , but he watches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lately , of course , Star Trek provides a special comfort . Not only does it posit the optimistic notion that humankind will exist into the next century , but it 's also a show about the wonders of technology and medicine - and this , after all , is what Bruce hangs all his hopes on . He dreams , daily , of a cure . But he also has a contingency plan . Earlier today , when he was in the mall buying his Star Trek book , Bruce sauntered over to the health section and looked for a book called Let Me Die Before I Wake , published by the Hemlock Society . It is a manual on how to commit suicide . <p> I 've seen pictures of people with AIDS who are in complete agony , ' Bruce says . I 'm not going to let that happen to me . I 've decided that I will die of a crippling disease , but not because of it . I wo n't let the disease kill me . ' <p> <p> WHEN RICK SPIKES A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital in nearby Portland . An examining intern thinks Rick has developed a bacterial infection in his sinuses : We 'll have to isolate the problem and find out what antibiotic to give him . ' <p> In the examining room , Rick undergoes a thrashing seizure which clearly startles the inexperienced young medical student . But Rick is soon brought under control and admitted to the hospital . <p> <p> ON THE DRIVE BACK FROM HIS MOTHER 'S place , Ken announces to Philip a sudden desire to go to the Limelight , the only gay disco in Portland . It is sing-along night , and Ken hates to miss it . <p> Long unsure of his purpose in life , Ken has always dreamed of being a singer . At the age of eleven , he started imitating his idol , Elvis Presley . Later , in high school , he performed Heartbreak Hotel ' in a talent show and discovered that nothing gave him greater pleasure than hearing an audience erupt into applause after he sang . Uncertain about what to do with his talent ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formal imitators ) , he recently discovered karaoke clubs - bars that play prerecorded background music and allow amateurs to sing along onstage with an open mike . There are two such clubs in the area that Ken frequents . Lately , he has been performing as often as three nights a week . Besides Philip , singing is what he cares about most in the world . It is the thing he will miss most when he gets sick . And that 's why he has made this sudden decision to arrow off into the night toward Portland . They have to be up early tomorrow , but every opportunity to sing is precious . And for some reason , tonight the possibility of dying young does not seem as remote as usual . <p> <p> JUST AS STAR TREK ' ' s END CREDITS ROLL , Bruce feels an unfamiliar stabbing pain in his lower abdomen . He feels around , gently , with his fingers at the edge of his rib cage . Is the pain muscular ? Is it his lungs ? It 's hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be the beginnings of PCP . The other day his mother said she was sure he was monkeying around ' with something ' in his lungs . And he has had an unusual , weak , dry cough lately . . . . <p> Or maybe the pain is just a side effect of the ddI . He must remember to ask someone about this . He 's also got to ask someone about the pinkish blotches in his armpits . He has n't mentioned them to anyone yet . He does n't want to worry his mother . <p> It 's odd , ' Bruce says suddenly , gazing at the TV screen . When I was a little kid , I would try to envision my life down the road . And I could never get past twenty-seven . ' He sips his ddI . It was like there was this blank area . ' <p> With that , Bruce collects his new Star Trek book and heads up to bed . <p> <p> NEAR MIDNIGHT , A NURSE ENTERS RICK 'S room . He groggily comes awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point just below his sternum . <p> I 've got your shot , ' the nurse whispers . Buttock or arm ? ' <p> Arm , ' Rick says weakly . He grimaces as she inserts the needle . The shot is Neupogen , a drug to stimulate production of white blood cells in his marrow . He will get three shots a week for as long as he is in the hospital . No one is hazarding any guesses how long that will be . <p> TABLE <p> <p> THE CROWDED BAR FALLS SILENT . HEADS turn toward the stage . After a moment of stunned incredulity that this perfectly ordinary-looking guy is able to sing like this , a wave of applause swells . <p> Ken 's eyes are closed , his head tilted back as he sways , gripping the mike . He is apparently oblivious to anything but bestowing upon every syllable and phoneme of the lyrics the vibratos , half-sobs and keening high notes that make this rendering indistinguishable from Elvis 's . But it is more than an imitation . He 's pouring something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , ' he croons . Take my whole life , too . . . . ' <p> Philip , sitting near the stage , sips his peach schnapps . He 's completely different when he does this , ' Philip says , his eyes moist . He does n't worry about anything . He does n't think about anything . ' <p> The song ends , the room explodes , and Ken trots off the stage . That makes everything worth it , ' he says , dropping onto the bench beside Philip . <p> That was positively frightening , ' the DJ tells the cheering crowd . Elvis is back from the dead ! ' <p> <p> ON THE MORNING OF JULY FOURTH , KEN and Philip hit the road at nine , headed for a confrontation or a reconciliation . <p> Bruce , feeling restless , drives the two hours into Bangor to see John Silvernail , head of the Eastern Maine AIDS Network , one of two support services in the northern part of the state . He tells Silvernail about Dr. Reed 's insistence that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will give a second opinion . Bruce leaves the meeting looking happier than he has in weeks . <p> Rick , after sleeping much of the day , wakes in his hospital room near dark , feeling better . Immediately , he 's planning for the future . He figures it should take him maybe three weeks to get his strength up . He starts to think about going camping with his folks in August and about his longer-term dream to go to Spain in the fall . He 's well into these musings when he sees a multicolored fireball erupt in the sky outside his window . He realizes it 's July Fourth , and immediately he switches on the TV to CNN , which is broadcasting the fireworks live from New York . <p> He stares , rapt , as the rockets bloom in the sky over Manhattan . Epidemiologists have theorized that the AIDS virus first arrived in America in quantity fifteen years ago this day , during the July Fourth bicentennial celebrations of 1976 . The Tall Ships sailed into New York Harbor and disgorged sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedrooms of the city . Fifteen years later , the disease has spread its tentacles into every state and city in the country and into every country in the world - which is one reason why , when you ask Rick what it 's like to live with AIDS , he says matter-of-factly : We 're all living with it . Not just the people who have it . ' <p> <p> Postscript : Though Ken was unable to locate his father during the summer trip , the two spoke recently . In October , Bruce experienced a precipitous drop in his T-cell count , and his Chronic Fatigue Syndrome worsened . Rick did manage to go camping with his family in August , as he had dreamed of doing . On October 6th , at 6:10 p.m. , he died . <p> <p> Some of the names in this piece have been changed . <p> <p> Photo : SILHOUETTE : KEN <p> Photo : BRUCE , 27 , MOVED HOME TO MAINE IN MARCH 1991 AFTER HE WAS HOSPITALIZED . <p> Photo : RICK , 27 , HAD TO BATTLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By JOHN COLAPINTO <p> Photographs by CHRISTOPHER NOFZIGER <p> <p> JOHN COLAPINTO is a freelance writer who lives in New York City . <p>
