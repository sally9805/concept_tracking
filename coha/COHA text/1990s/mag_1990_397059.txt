Consider the cheeseburger in all its gooey glory . Startling new evidence suggests it might actually help prevent cancer . <p> MICHAEL PARIZA , an authority on cancer-causing chemicals in food , did not set out to become the nation 's most upbeat cheeseburgerologist . In the late 1970s , in fact , his lab was one of several that showed that substances in charred hamburger might be capable of causing cancer . Then Barry Commoner , that celebrated guardian of planetary , welfare , did a well-publicized study also suggesting that burgers were carcinogenic . And so the humble sandwich that tamed the highway and plumped the suburbs , that sold jillions , that won over the world , that even Dad could cook  --  now it , too , was being filed under the Big C. A heartbreaker , but it figured . After all , the " average person in modern societies lives in a veritable sea of carcinogens , " columnist Jane Brody <p> wrote during the apocalyptic 1970s , when average persons learned the frightful logic of the burger equation , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared disease . <p> Imagine Pariza 's surprise when , in his later experiments , mice that bad been given an extract of fried hamburger developed fewer tumors than presented in a 1985 paper titled " A other mice . Still , this good news , Beef-Derived Mutagenesis Modulator Inhibits Initiation of Mouse Epidermal Tumors by **28;0;TOOLONG , " did not exactly roust Dan Rather out of bed . The big splash came last year , after Pariza discovered the potential anti-tumor properties of Cheez Whiz . <p> It played like some jokey industry stunt , but it was n't meant that way . Pariza , a trim 47 , is chairman of the Department of Food Microbiology and Toxicology , and director of the Food Research Institute , at the University of Wisconsin  --  Madison , a state that takes cheese seriously . Pariza had no way of knowing that of all the cheese he would test for anticancer substances , the Whiz would come our on top . <p> Many of his findings , while they fit right in with the latest thinking on natural anti-carcinogens in food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Big Mac . Nor only does the cheeseburger now join broccoli and carrots on the do-gooder 's menu of cancer-resisting foods , and not only is the best such burger dripping with a processed cheese spread  --  yes , Jane , a veritable symbol of our dietary , decadence  --  but the protective substance itself turns out to be , of all things , a kind of fat . <p> Feeling better ? As you bite into a burger and melted orange goo runs down your forearms , the best way to explain your deeply self-righteous smile is to serve up some scientific evidence . <p> Back in the early 1980s , Pariza and coworkers grilled some burgers on a special lab contraption , mixed them with solvents , and then applied these extracts to the skin of dozens of mice . To the same skin patches they applied another chemical guaranteed to cause cancer ( see the longest word in paragraph two ) . After several months , the mice treated with burger essence had only half as many skin tumors as the other mice . Eventually , Pariza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extract was a kind of fatty acid  --  an oil , actually , named CLA . Interestingly , cooked ground beef , which the health police have long claimed to be especially bad for you , had much more of the beneficial CLA than raw beef , since heat seems to turn another substance into CLA . <p> Burned or charred beef docs in fact contain carcinogens , as Pariza 's lab had previously shown , but he has since found that cooking over moderate heat  --  medium on the range  --  produces so few that they are " negligible . " Such a low-cooked burger , he ventures , may on balance have more cancer-preventing than cancer-promoting chemicals . <p> Since people do n't generally apply hamburgers to their skin , the scientists did some slightly more realistic tests . Having synthesized CLA in the lab , they tube-fed the stuff to mice for several months . The animals were also fed a potent carcinogen . Compared with mice that had been fed more vegetable oil and the same carcinogens , the CLA-treated mice had far fewer digestive tract tumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal studies , " Pariza cautions , " but I think it 's logical that CLA plays a similar protective role in humans . " <p> How CLA might do that is , well , complicated . There seem to be several mechanisms . Simply put , CLA stops certain chemical changes  --  oxidation reactions  --  that , once begun , may promote wild cell growth and tumors . Next to other anti-oxidants , CLA is fairly potent stuff  --  even more effective than vitamin E. lake a burger on the grill , the human body , Pariza says , seems to produce precious CLA . Scientists have found traces of it in blood and other tissues , and while no one knows precisely what this bodily CLA does , Pariza speculates that it " helps protect the body from the kinds of chemical damage that can lead to tumors . " <p> Inevitably , the Wisconsin scientists got interested in dairy ' products . Milk , they found , contains some CLA . In their tests of several cheeses , blue bad the least CLA , cheddar and Romano had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won by a mile , the CLA amounting to nearly 1% of the fat . Pariza , hazarding a bold inductive leap , speculates that the whey added to Cheez Whiz boosts its CLA mightily . <p> To be sure , the research raises many important questions . Does , say , Velveeta contain CLA ? Probably . Does tofu ? Unlikely . Hot dogs ? Most likely . Pork , lamb , poultry ? No doubt . Fish ? Ca n't say . Fruits and vegetables ? Not much . Butter ? You bet . Does CLA really protect people from cancer ? " We 're not close to answering that  --  not without some large and complicated clinical trials , " which , one might add , will probably never happen . Does Pariza eat Cheez Whiz burgers ? Yes , a few per month . Does he think Americans should eat more cheeseburgers in order to avoid cancer ? " Absolutely not . " <p> From Pariza 's studies we learn anew that fat is a slippery subject . Its relationship to human cancer , like its relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . It was n't long ago that our health-addled minds had to make morn for " good " cholesterol . Fatty fish is now said to be good for the heart , thanks to its Omega-3 oils . Olive oil , formerly looked down upon as not polyunsaturated enough to protect against heart disease , now wins high marks for precisely that . And the paradoxical French , have one of the world 's lowest heart disease rates while enjoying one of the rattiest diets south of the Arctic Circle , <p> The widely reported link between fatty diets and breast cancer , for example , is now disputed . Curiously , in a few recent studies , people who increased their consumption of fat tended to have fewer cancers of the stomach and esophagus . Another study relevant to Pariza 's work found that Japanese who ate a diet including meat and vegetables had a much lower rate of colon cancer than people who ate primarily meat or vegetables . Score one for the virtues of variety and balance . <p> For now , Pariza 's achievement is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a vaccine against excessive worry . As the vivacious epicure Julia Child said recently in The New York Times , " If fear of food continues , it will be the death of gastronomy in the United States . " Child , who is 78 , lamented that Americans " arc no longer enjoying food the way they once did , and the dinner table is becoming a trap rather than a pleasure . " <p> Pariza , by silencing the smug tsk-tsking of the health nags , has restored some of the lost pleasure of eating . " I 'm opposed to the popular idea of ' good ' food and ' bad ' food , " he says . " It 's nonsense . There has been way too much public speculation and hysteria from scientists and the press on specific dietary factors and disease . Ton many people cat to avoid chronic disease rather than to enjoy a meal . That , if you ask me , is the tragedy . " <p> Welcome , then , to 90s-style wholism  --  the nutritional Rainbow Coalition  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat clogging your arteries , you might also envision CLA building up your tissues  --  possible health insurance provided by wise indulgence . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : On the cutting edge : Labor Day in San Francisco , 1934 <p> By Terence Monmaney <p> <p> Terence Monmaney is a writer living in New York who covers science . <p>
