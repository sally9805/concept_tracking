<p> LOS ANGELES <p> Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is making a holiday shopping list consisting entirely of ornaments  --  spectacular but threatened places that decorate the vast landscape of the American West . Before urban sprawl engulfs them , Babbitt wants to give these 2 million acres to future Americans for centuries of contemplation . <p> Delivering an ultimatum to Congress , Babbitt has made it clear that , unless the lawmakers act first , he will sign off on a " preliminary " list this month of at least seven environmentally delicate Western sites . He 'll then ask President Clinton to sign executive orders designating them as national monuments , bypassing a Congress that Babbitt says is dawdling . <p> National monument status restricts industrial and some recreational access . It ensures that land ca n't be sold or subdivided into " ranchettes . " But a monument typically has fewer use restrictions than a national park or wilderness . Roads , livestock grazing , hunting and fishing are allowed . <p> As skeptical Republicans see it , Babbitt is merely trying to build monuments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Vice President Gore 's presidential campaign . <p> " I think it 's the height of arrogance to say , ' If you , Congress , do n't act on this , we 'll just do it ourselves , ' " Rep. Jim Kolbe , R-Ariz. , says . " There may be some saber-rattling to get Congress to do their will , but it 's going to be counterproductive . " <p> Babbitt is worried that time is running out for the administration to establish a conservation legacy , but he will give Congress more time to consider legislation that would preserve several additional sites from encroaching commercial exploitation or recreational overuse . <p> " It would be nice to have Congress involved , " Babbitt says , " but one thing we do n't want to do is just defer and have this discussion go on forever , and then find the lights are out . " <p> The places under review exemplify the West 's beauty . Among them : <p> * Along 140 miles of the upper Missouri River in Montana , the rugged canyons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in 1804 . Babbitt would like the United States to take control to prevent property owners from turning these untamed lands into 10-acre ranchettes . <p> * Along 1,000 miles of California coastline , thousands of islets deflect the waves skyward . Mineral exploration on the rocky islets could ruin their scenic value someday , Babbitt fears . <p> * The San Andreas Fault surfaces to carve a jagged trench through southern California 's Carrizo Plain , 120 miles northwest of Los Angeles . Oil and gas wells edge the plain , where some of the last primal grasslands of the agricultural and urbanizing San Joaquin Valley survive . <p> * A plateau near Cortez , Colo. , is dotted with the pottery shards and pueblo remains of the Anasazi Indian civilization , which mysteriously vanished 1,000 years ago . Babbitt wants to save the land from subdivision . <p> * On 73,000 acres of cliffs and trails that Babbitt wants added to the Colorado National Monument , it 's possible to stand and observe the sprawl of Grand Junction , Colo . <p> * Perry Mesa , near Babbitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the path of sprawl spreading north from Phoenix . <p> Critics condemn ' land grab'Western cattle grazers , miners and Republican lawmakers say the grandeur of these lands can co-exist with development . Most of these lands are in federal hands , though there are some enclaves that belong to the states and to private landowners . <p> Pro-development forces in the rural West resent the means the administration is using to dodge their strongholds in Congress . Babbitt wants Clinton to employ the potent Antiquities Act of 1906 , which empowers him to decree national monuments on his own . <p> Some Westerners say Babbitt 's challenge to Congress is a federal " land grab , " sacrificing traditional rural economies to boost Gore 's stock with green-minded voters . <p> " It 's very political , and it stinks to high heaven , " says Rep. James Hansen , R-Utah , chairman of the House subcommittee on national parks and public lands . <p> Western conservatives are still livid over Clinton 's September 1996 appearance at the Grand Canyon , where without advance notice , he used his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coal-rich southern Utah into the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument . Locking up the land against mining helped Clinton that November with environment-minded voters , but the move was so unpopular in Utah that it cost Democrat Bill Orton his House seat . <p> " This administration likes to fly in , fly out , have a photo opportunity and with the stroke of a pen , create long-term problems that members of the congressional delegation are left to solve , " says Sean Conway , an aide to Sen. Wayne Allard , R-Colo . <p> Though Grand Staircase-Escalante has brought more tourists to the area , Clinton 's 1996 pen-stroke made the Antiquities Act anathema to Hansen . He wrote a bill requiring Congress and the affected state 's governor and legislature to approve any monument over 5,000 acres . <p> The measure has passed in the House . Clinton has threatened to veto it if it gets through the Senate next year , Interior Department spokesman Tim Ahern says . <p> Preservation powers <p> Clinton is hardly the first president to sidestep Congress when it comes to preserving public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect the Grand Canyon , which was upgraded to a national park in 1919 . Every president since then except Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan and George Bush has employed the act . There are more than 100 national monuments . <p> The law reserves the designation for lands having " scientific , historic or archaeological significance . " <p> Critics say the administration is proposing oversized monuments and does n't always explain how the lands meet the law 's definition . " A lot of these things are hardly deserving , " Hansen says . <p> Congress can create national monuments , but on some of Babbitt 's proposed sites , lawmakers would rather declare national conservation areas . These can be custom-crafted to provide a lesser level of protection , appeasing ranchers , forestry workers and off-road-vehicle users who do n't want to be fenced out . <p> Environmental organizations welcome Babbitt 's monument proposals . Daniel Weiss , Sierra Club political director in Washington , says the group would " appreciate " the designations , and assumes that the idea " stems from Gore 's influence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , the club has n't endorsed either Gore or Bradley . Each is being asked to fill out an exacting questionnaire on his environmental views . <p> Babbitt 's plan is unpopular with business users of public lands . Chuck Cushman , executive director of the American Land Rights Association , which represents 18,000 people who hold lands within national parks and national monuments , says the administration is " as close to a dictatorship in land use as we 've ever seen in this country . " <p> National Mining Association President Richard Lawson says presidential withdrawal of more public lands from new mining claims would be a fresh example of " the administration 's assault against the mining industry . " <p> Babbitt dismisses his opponents as " the self-styled property-rights crowd , who basically are arguing as a matter of ideology that the government should sell off the public lands . " <p> Rather than directly rebut charges of political motivation , Babbitt says he 'll be asking Clinton to act in " a tradition of presidential leadership that is 100 years old and has produced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spokesman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality , says , " My sense is that this would be happening whether or not Gore was running . " <p> What Clinton does with Babbitt 's list " is entirely unknown to me at this point , " Babbitt says . Diringer says the president will consider Interior Department recommendations case by case . Past administrations often have designated national monuments in their final months as " a last shot , a legacy , " Diringer says . <p> Hansen says the Constitution gives Congress , not the president , the power to say how public land is used . " It 's even questionable in my mind that the Antiquities Act is constitutional , " he says . " I wish somebody would challenge it in court . " <p> Congress can de-authorize a national monument , but has never done so ; it 's politically risky . <p> ' No surprises here ' <p> To avoid a repeat of the outcry over Grand Staircase-Escalante , Babbitt has given Congress and local residents months of notice about where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " he says . " There are no surprises here . " <p> Asked by Clinton to find sites needing protection , Babbitt kicked off his drive in November 1998 with a hike on the Shivwits Plateau of the " Arizona Strip . " The 570,000-acre high country north of the Grand Canyon is threatened by Las Vegas ' growth and by potential uranium mining . <p> Babbitt has barnstormed as many as four times through the sites under review , holding public meetings . " He 's been a veritable Oprah Winfrey for his cause , " says Melinda Pierce , a Sierra Club representative in Washington . <p> Republicans say Babbitt is n't making local converts . In a joint letter to the secretary in October , Rep. Scott McInnis , R-Colo. , and Colorado Sens . Allard and Ben Nighthorse Campbell said southwestern Colorado communities want no change in management of federal lands . <p> The three legislators say they 're talking to Colorado officials about the Anasazi ruins site to find an alternative to Babbitt 's " stated threat to usurp local recommendations and congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive order . " <p> Babbitt wo n't immediately ask Clinton to employ the Antiquities Act where prospects of getting a pleasing bill out of Congress look good . <p> Isolated Steens Mountain in southeastern Oregon , for which Democratic Gov . John Kitzhaber and Rep. Greg Walden , R-Ore. , are teaming to recommend a protection plan , is " the one that 's going best at this point , " Babbitt says . Long a proposed national park , the scenic mountain and grassland area is n't in immediate jeopardy , but " let 's protect it while we can , " Ahern says . Winning Oregon officials ' consensus on Soda Mountain , just off busy Interstate 5 near Ashland , is n't as far along . <p> Babbitt praises Kolbe for a " model process " of harmonizing opinion toward legislation that would protect the Las Cienegas-Empire Ranch area near sprawling Tucson . The ranch has 50,000 acres of desert , farm and grazing land with Indian ruins . <p> By contrast , Babbitt sounds ready to ask Clinton to pre-empt a national conservation area bill written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bill is " not even close , " lacking sufficient environmental safeguards , says Babbitt . <p> At sunset , the Santa Rosa Mountains overlooking prosperous Palm Springs , Calif. , shade from pink to purple like settings in a Zane Grey novel . But golf courses and luxury homes are creeping toward the slopes . <p> Rep. Mary Bono , R-Calif. , says that except for Palm Springs ' city government and some resort developers , who fear a new layer of red tape , her constituents like Babbitt 's idea of a San Jacinto-Santa Rosa Mountains National Monument . They see it as an aid to tourism . Willing to sponsor such a bill , she held a public hearing last Tuesday in Rancho Mirage . <p> " There 's so much pressure from the administration , " she says . " I feel that I 'm the little train on the railroad tracks , chugging along , and there 's this huge bullet train coming behind me . I have to keep up . If I do n't , they 're going to run right over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in another instance . On the last day of this year 's session , Congress gave wilderness status to Otay Mountain , on the California-Mexico border near San Diego . The mountain had been on Babbitt 's early list . " The monument discussion produced it , " he says . <p> Contributing : Valerie Alvord
