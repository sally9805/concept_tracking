In an extraordinary career as potter , painter , sculptor and industrial designer , Viktor Schreckengost translated into American art and design the modern , innovative spirit he had absorbed during sojourns in the late 1920s and early 1930s in Vienna . Associated with the Cleveland Institute of Art as student and as educator for over 70 years , he has continued to teach one class , as Emeritus Professor , since his retirement in 1976 . William Daley , the ceramic artist and Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of the Arts , Philadelphia , has admired Schreckengost since he first saw his prizewinning work in " Ceramic National catalogues of the Syracuse Museum 40 years ago . Last fall , after a stop at the Cleveland Zoo to see Schreckengost 's 1950s terra-cotta murals , Daley spent an afternoon with the nonagenarian artist at his home . Their conversation follows . WILLIAM DALEY : Unlike most of us , you started out in a pottery environment . What was it like to be a youngster with all that around you ? VIKTOR SCHRECKENGOST : After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O. H. Sebring , the third brother , decided to start the French China Company . Potters were pretty scarce at that time , so he went to Pennsylvania and talked to my dad and two of his brothers . As soon as the plant was finished , they moved to Sebring to work with O. H. at the French . They were general potters . My father was in charge of the bisque kilns first , and then he did all the samples and all the special things , like the mazarine blue glaze . I was the first kid born in our family in Ohio , in 1906 , and I knew all of the Sebring brothers and eventually worked for them , and later as a designer . Did you work as a boy , in high school ? Even earlier than that , in the summertime . My first job was to run up on the hill and get drinking water for the clay shop . The men would drink this ice cold water . We 'd get a nickel a trip . The unions were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always a ladder somewhere , and as soon as word came that the inspectors were coming , we 'd go up on the roof and look down from the skylights until they left . Was the work mostly cast or pressed or did they do everything ? Usually either jiggering or casting out in the clay shops . Once we got big enough , we ran molds . The jiggerman had his own crew and he would pay . He got paid for so many thousand dozen , and he could have his wife come in or his kids . We 'd work on a daily basis of 25 cents , or whatever , to run back into the heat rooms . With boards of Not only boards but molds . We 'd bring out hot ones , dry ones , so they could knock the pieces out . There may have been four or five kids on every jiggerman 's spot . We were really running molds . Did they have big filter presses for preparing clay ? Yes , that was all done ahead and extruded into big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clay came through , to take the moisture out they had canvas bags with a hole in the center where the clay was put through and then the water dripped out . All the workers wore these as aprons , but I never realized it . I wondered why the hole was right in the middle . They were probably all Crosley presses . I 'm not sure now . They had all kinds of workshops . They made their own saggers . They built everything right there . You were saying that even as a boy in high school you got a chance to design . Tell me about that . What did you design ? It was for another outfit- the Gem Clay Forming Company-made mantel rings for gaslights . They had a secret formula for the clay . It was porous and nobody knew how they made it . I found out that they mixed some sawdust with the clay . It would burn out and there were little holes all through it .

Do you remember the little radiants ? They were making them for several people , but they were almost all diagonal grids . There was a company on the West Coast that wanted a special one . I designed a pine cone at the bottom with a pattern of pine needles at the top . They were so crazy about it that they gave Gem Clay Forming all their business . I read about your being a saxophone player . I played in the high school orchestra , but then there was a band out of Ohio State , Ken Webb 's Orchestra . They were playing through the summers , Geauga Lake , Chippewa Lake , all over the place . So I played sax and clarinet with them . When we were quite small my dad taught my two brothers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us and we gave many concerts . So you were part of a musical family and a clay family . Mother played the piano and my father the violin . We loved to hear the old songs . I was really serious about becoming a musician , but what turned me off was that every holiday I had to play some place . When I was in Cleveland , I picked up many gigs . It 's interesting about music . When I got to Vienna-around 1929-1 did play with a restaurant orchestra and got the group turned around from an " oompa " band to a smooth big band sound . Edgar Kaufmann , Jr . was also a student in Vienna at that time ( and later became director of industrial design at the Museum of Modern Art ) . He was asked years later by Laurence Schmeckebier , head of the Cleveland Institute of Art , " By the way did you know Vik Schreckengost when he was in Vienna ? " wondering if he knew about my art work , and he said , " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you decide you were going to art school ? I think that was 1925 , the year I was born . We 're a generation apart ! I 'll be darned . Well , my dad would bring clay home and we 'd model toys and he would fire them and bring them back . We found that we could melt crayons-we did n't know enough about glazes-and coat these things in all colors . Soldiers , football teams , just everything . My dad could get these big sheets , the ones they strip the decals off-beautiful white paper . When my parents went out in the evening , they 'd pass out the paper and give us a subject and we were supposed to draw while they were gone . When they got home , they would judge them and whoever won got to go to Alliance the next weekend when my mother went shopping . How many were in this gallery ? I had three sisters and two brothers , so there were six of us . My first one-man show was in Youngstown , when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers for school , cut them out of colored paper . I had done so many that when they picked the 20 to go to the show , they looked at the names on the back and they were all mine . The superintendent said , " Do n't say anything . Let 's send them . " Did you decide in high school that you would go on to art school ? Yes . I wanted in the worst way to get out of the pottery business . You were nobody in Sebring if you were a potter . The whole town was about pottery . Everybody had more respect for Johnny Allen , whose father had a furniture store . There was an artist who lived down the street and worked for a publishing company in Cleveland . I could talk to him a little bit about the illustrations that he was doing . He said that cartooning was a real interesting business , so when I signed up for the Cleveland School of Art now Cleveland Institute of Art , they asked me what I wanted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I wanted to be , a cartoonist . But you got the same treatment , regardless of what you were going to be . It was fabulous when I found that I had to take sculpture and model from live models . We had life drawing and still life painting and did some things in clay . In the first two years you had a chance to try everything . You had a two-year foundation program . Then I had to make a decision and decided on design . I liked the broad field of it . It was called decorative design then . And that was a major ? Yes , along with painting and everything else . What kinds of things did you do ? Design for the theater . We had to design sconces . A Cleveland stove manufacturing company came out and wanted some stoves designed , and many of my designs were chosen . We designed silverware , and I won all kinds of things through International Silver . We had to make batiks . We learned to do everything , from laying gold leaf-all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw for the first time at Cleveland Institute . I had two years of it . I just loved it . You had ceramics as a senior ? As a minor . Two years with Arthur Baggs . Wonderful man . And R. Guy Cowan , who was there , finally said , " Well , at least you 'll take ceramics as a minor . " He had known my family in Sebring . You were connected . And you eventually went to work at the Cowan Pottery Studio also ? That was the arrangement when I came back from Vienna . Later on , when you did your bowls-like your famous Jazz punch bowl , and so on-were they thrown ? At first , but then I found that to reproduce them they had to have more precision , to fit the jigger head and everything . I would turn them directly in plaster , like the big bowls , and then when I did the poor man 's version of the punch bowl , the decoration was in relief . I 'd do that in plaster with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back in . Did you then jigger those in a negative ? They were all jiggered . The first bowls had a tendency to pull off to one side or get irregular if you got them too near the wall of the kiln . Then I turned big clay rings and cast them . I 'd drop them on as a flange and throw them away after we got the bisque fired . Was Cowan your mentor at Cleveland Institute ? He helped me all the time , but I still felt funny about the sculpture I saw being done in this country . It was so obviously done with the constraint of molds . I did n't like that type . In 1928 a show of European ceramics came through and I just fell in love with the art . Man , I looked and I could see how fresh everything was , but I did n't realize at the time that they were n't made with molds . Seeing these things made you want to study in Europe ? Absolutely , and I picked out one potter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was teaching with Vally Wieselthier and Susi Singer , who were also in the show . So I thought , how do I get to Vienna ? I talked with Julius Mihalik , my design teacher . He had taught at the Royal Academy in Budapest and then gone to Vienna to the Kunstgewerbeschule . He knew Powolny and Josef Hoffmann and all those people , and he said he would see what he could do . I think I sent some photographs of my stuff and word came back they 'd like to interview me . Go to Vienna for an interview ? I did n't know what to do . I decided I would try to make some money , and I designed for the Gem Clay Forming Company again and made a little bit of money there . Then I won a Page Scholarship for $350 at the institute . But that would hardly pay the round-trip boat fare . Finally , one of the men at Gem Clay loaned me $1,500 and I could go . I got to Vienna and appeared at the Kunstgewerbschule and met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hoffmann and several people , with an interpreter . They all agreed that what they saw of my drawings and photographs was something they would like me to continue . They said , " Now , the only problem is that this is a government school . You 're a foreigner . We do n't know how much you 'll have to pay . Come back tomorrow . " When I came back , Powolny met me , took me up to Dr. Roller 's office . He said , " We 've agreed that you will pay 25 times the normal . " I said , " Then good-bye . I 'm not rich and I can never pay 25 times tuition . " He said , " But wait , how much do you think it is ? " It came out that students paid $2.75 . My whole fee was less than $70 . Was the school very different from the Cleveland Institute ? Completely . I was assigned to Powolny as my main instructor . I would appear there at 8:00 in the morning and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing he wanted to see was examples of throwing on the wheel . He took us through , showed us all the different clays , what he wanted us to use . Then he would disappear and at 4:30 p.m. he returned with two sticks and a wire and cut all the pots apart . He was so curious about structure , the cantilevered sections , whether or not the structure would support the form . That was critical to him . If he cut the work apart , you were n't concerned about finishing . That 's right , we would just cut the forms off the wheel . They called me the " one-man pottery " after a while . I had boards full of stuff ready for him to cut . I did that for six weeks , and finally one day he grinned when he looked at the things and out of his vest pocket he took a tiny stamp and put a seal on the back . Now it could be fired . So you had to get to a certain level . You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There everything you made was fired . Did you have drawing with him also ? Did you have more drawing at Cleveland than at the Kunstgewerbeschule ? Yes , but in Vienna there was a kind of drawing I had not seen . Fullsize newsprint paper , up to six-foot strips and the only thing we could draw with was chalk the size of an eraser . When the model stood up , all you had time to do , in 10 or 12 minutes , was put in the masses and shadows . You 'd go through four or five views , change to a new one , put down another piece of paper . Then we 'd take a five-minute rest , go back in and pull the first paper out and back into that and make the drawing . God , they looked like Rodin sculptures . Every one looked massive . Just quickly realized . Yes , but the mass , they looked like great chunks of stone . Did you find that you were accomplished , in the sense of the way you 'd learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me draw . I 'd already had three or four years of life drawing . So you were prepared . Did Powolny do sculpture with you along with the wheel work ? Yes . It was exciting . And Hoffmann would come in and look at my work and grin and shake his head . So he really was part of the school . He was teaching all kinds of things . Then we had glaze study and of course I could get along with that . But the first thing I did was find a German instructor . I had to , but in chemistry and all it did n't make any difference ; I could understand everything that was going on . The most interesting thing to me later was when I heard them talk about having a beer party and should they invite the Auslander-foreigner- meaning me . They said , " No , he has Prohibition . He ca n't drink . " They had a very clear philosophy about craft and making . The sincerity , the honesty . " It must be honest , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in a bowl , is it happiness ? is it closed in ? - that kind of thing . And there was working with the others . We did four big figures for the Triennale in Milan . The whole figure was hand-thrown and put together like ceramic sewer tile . Four feet high , each section . The figures were 8 to 10 feet high . Remember , we had only kick wheels in Vienna-no power wheels-and with those , one man kicked and the other two would stand and pull the clay up to make a big cylinder first and then you would form them . On top of these figures was a great bowl , each filled with fruit or flowers , all hand-thrown . Did you fire your own work ? No , they had men who would load the kiln . You had to separate and mark what your glazes were or what fire you wanted . Then we 'd go down to the kiln , but these men would do it . First they 'd look and see if it was okay to fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips ? Powolny took us to a porcelain factory where he had many of his beautiful little figures made . And to a tile factory where he had done a lot of big tile stoves . We 'd also go to the museum . You must have had culture shock when you returned to Cleveland . Cowan had come over while I was in Vienna . He met Powolny for the first time and Hoffmann . Anyway , he said , " I want you to work for me when you come back . " I said , " Well , it sounds real good . How much would it be ? " He said , " I 'll let you know before you come home . " So I pretty much agreed to it . Then I got a cable from Ohio State University saying they were setting up a new department and " there 's a good chance that Arthur Baggs will be there on the technical end and we 'd like to have you come and head a design class . The money was more than Cowan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it until you hear from me . " I waited and finally he said , " I have a better job for you . You work for me three days a week and the institute three days and we double your salary . " So I told Ohio State I would n't be available , but I had " a real good friend who would be perfect , Paul Bogatay . " He went and stayed the rest of his life . Was he a classmate of yours ? Yes , and he worked for Cowan while I was in Europe . Who were the other classmates that you had as colleagues ? Edris Eckhardt was a year back of me . Elizabeth " Betty " Andersen ( who became Mrs. Eliot Ness ) was one year ahead . She worked for Cowan . Thelma Frazier Winter was in my design class . We went through four years together . Pretty amazing group . Just one after another and then Doris Hall in enameling and Eddie H. Edward Winter two years later . Was Kenneth Bates part of that ? Kenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was not himself doing enameling at that time . When Schmeckebier came , he made every one of us get involved and actually do what we were talking about . So you had to be a practitioner . That 's right . But when I came back , I was a bit disturbed that the school was so fine arts oriented . I said to Henry Hunt Clark , " You know , everything here is so old-fashioned . We 're not with it . " He said , " Well , I do n't know how you can have two masters . " I said , " Why ca n't we have another course of design for mass production . " Industrial design . So you started doing that right when you came back ? No . As soon as I came back , I taught sophomore design . Normally the last one in goes to the bottom , but Bates said , " Boy , when you came back from Vienna you were so far ahead of me in concepts . I do n't want to teach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to go in after me . " Mihalik , my old design teacher , was there , and I said why could n't we have both ornamental designwhere a lot of students were women-and an industrial group . I was given one boy whose family owned an Amish store , and I thought he was kind of a strange one to give me . " I 'll let you work with this boy , " Clark said , " and if you can do it , maybe we 'll expand it . " So I had this boy for two years , and he became one of the top designers in Washington . I asked him what he wanted to do and he said furniture . I took him up to Grand Rapids and to Zeeland , Michigan . I took him to the Bedford Chair Company right here and showed him how they do mass production . In Europe did they make a distinction between manufacturing and craft and design ? One-off as opposed to multiples . That 's what interested Cowan , limited editions . Why does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do one-offs and limited editions for exhibitions , but I was thinking , " Let 's get into the mass business . " Well , you really were doing both . Yes , unconsciously , without knowing what it was all about . They finally said in 1933 , let 's have a design class , too-industrial design . After being in Vienna , what was it that seemed out of synch to you ? It was , for instance , the contemporary architecture I 'd seen over there . I did n't see any of it here . Modernism was really emerging in Europe . And the architects were working with the sculptors and the craftsmen . Everything was part of one whole . So that was another aspect , collaboration . That 's what the Bauhaus was about , collaboration between the arts . That was so different from here , where it was pieces of stuff and there did n't seem to be any coordination . Did they have a different idea about materials ? They preached honesty of materials all the time . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1931 , when I built a studio in Sebring in back of my father 's house , a company came to me and asked if I would be interested in doing some tombstones . I said , " Sure . " They said , " We 'll do them in ceramics . I do n't see why we ca n't do some beautiful new concepts . " Ceramic tombstones ? Yes . So I started the work and got all excited and I measured all the sizes , how we could etch the names into the surface . I used images of poppies , the symbol of sleep . I had the design all ready and they came in , looked at them and said , " Okay , we like the models . How can we make them look like marble or granite ? " " Well , if that 's what you had in mind , " I said , al wish you 'd told me because I 'm not the least bit interested in phonies . There 's no reason why these ca n't be ceramic material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find . " Two weeks later they called : " You 're going to have to do it in the granite look or marble . " I said , " Forget it . " That settled that . When Hoffmann was doing things and people were working with him in Vienna , how did they work together ? Did they do it through drawings ? As a consortium , to start with . When they were ready for carpeting , for example , they called in the carpet designer and said what they wanted . That person would design it , a fiber person ? Made it fit the architect 's overall concept . Like the architects I worked with for the Cleveland Zoo came to me and said , " Look , we have an idea for the zoo . We do n't have to use any more signs than we need . Why ca n't a person walking through the zoo recognize the bird building . It does n't have to have a sign on it , does it ? Ca n't we use symbolism ? " I visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building are thrilling to look at . Did you backfill those with mortar ? They 're part of the bearing wall . Every piece has an 8- to 12-inch extension back inside and becomes part of the bearing wall . It was done in 1952 to ' ' 54 . I was scared to death because they made me sign a contract that those pieces would last at least 25 years . Well , you do n't have to worry about that contract . Where did you produce and fire them ? Photograph BELOW : Schreckengost designs on view in " Three Generations of Designers " at the Cleveland Institute of Art , August 23October 6,1996. // I heard about the Federal Seaboard company , owned by two nice Danish fellows , the Mathieson brothers , in Perth Amboy , New Jersey . I went and talked to them and they said they 'd love to do that . " Okay , would you give me the center of the kiln , so I do n't get warpage ? " They said , " Yes . " The first one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full size , so the architects would have some idea of the detail . Did you do that with everything , build it solid and then carve or work it back out ? I modeled directly on a big armature . I made the Archaeopteryx full scale , a plaster casting of it , shipped it and did quarter-scale models of the others . I did the full-size modeling right in the plant . You were doing industrial design , architectural commissions and designing china and making pots , all at the same time . And glass and all kinds of stuff . Have you seen those plates , the peasant things that look as though they 're hand-thrown ? The company I was making them for said they were much too modern . I designed very simple shapes with bright-colored patterns . One of them was " Flower Shop . " I remember them . How many carloads ? Why did they have such appeal to people ? First of all , the plate had flowers on it . That 's what every woman wanted . Dinnerware had to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new kind of flower . They went crazy over that plate . Marshall Fields , all of the stores across the country bought them . One store in Cleveland sold 28 carloads of that pattern . That was the middle of the Depression . It was awful , nobody working . Anyway , before the year was over we had used the full capacity of Limoges and were using five of the kilns in the Sebring Pottery to make this stuff fast enough . Why do you think people were responsive to modernism or modern design ? They were so filled up with the old dead stuff , I think that was it . And it was inexpensive-the whole 32-piece set sold for $7.95 . Imagine that ! You also had plates with the colored centers and banding . They 're gorgeous . They still are . And they were designed in the early 30s . If you 'd let me take a set home , I 'd go with those . They 're so striking . You could see this pattern long before Freddy Frederick Hurten Rhead 's Fiestaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's all this nostalgia . Freddy Rhead was an English potter who 'd come over and worked for Rookwood for a while . Then he came to Homer Laughlin 's . He almost got fired in 1935 because he wrote in the Crockery and Glass Journal that the most exciting new thing in the pottery industry was my new designs for Limoges . Do you think studio potters today think about design as they use their materials ? I 'm not sure . Some things I see now , I do n't know what the excitement is for making things look crude . There 's so much of the oneoff stuff , teapots that no way can pour . Then function and usage and personal expression are connected ? I want a connection . If it 's supposed to perform a function , then it should perform it . Otherwise make a thing . The first year that we had an industrial design class at Cleveland , I took the junior class down to the pottery . I said , " The only thing we 're not going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been using the stuff for 20 years . But , heck , have you ever looked at it ? Now , what is the function of a plate ? How much should it prevent food flopping around when you 're cutting ? Is it to hold spaghetti ? What kind of use ? " Then I asked , " How many of you know how wide a shelf is in a cupboard ? because these plates have to stack in there The union permits a quarter-inch variation because they know on dry days it will be a different size than on a damp day . We started to get into all these things the students never thought about before . About the production of it . Not only that , but the use of it . Will it fit into a dishwasher ? Is it possible to meet those parameters about usage and still have the work be personal , have a signature ? To be personal it does n't have to be crude . I have the same feeling about crazy chairs . If they do a sculpture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Let 's make a sculpture that has a sculptural quality . I 'm sure there is a way to do that . Craft then is not simply the material . It 's use . I wish I had one of those casseroles that when you flip the lid it becomes the tray on which you serve . And all those crazy little wire things that I made-trivets . They 're an honest use of a material . I found a lot of times working with industrial design students that they did n't know much about the material and so they really could n't design well . Has your knowledge of material helped you as a designer ? Absolutely . That 's where it starts . Do you see design and craft as being separate ? Yes , because the goal of industrial design is mass production ; crafts are often limited to one-offs . Photograph 1931 , punch bowl , earthenware , IP/aby 16tb inches , for Cowan Pottery Studio , collection of Cowan Pottery Museum at Rocky River Public Library . OPPOSITE PAGE : Children 's pedal cars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " Three Generations of Designers . " // Is this coming from the way we 're educating everybody-separately ? The design students are educated one way and the craft another . I do think that design training , rather than a craft training , is more about the material used and reproduction possibilities . Making things in numbers . Less elitist . I used to drive to school and one morning I counted 32 things from here to the art school that I had designed-from exhaust fans to lawn mowers , tractors , lighting fixtures for the streetlights . It was just as exciting to me as going to the art museum and seeing one of my paintings . I get almost more of a kick out of seeing the influence of my toys-good design-on kids growing up . I 'm sure they had more of an effect , much more , than kids going to the museum once a year . You see being a designer as a social thing . How do you feel about guys like Bernard Leach and the idea of studio pottery ? I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a respect from the engineering side . The biggest problem now is that the engineers still question the artist 's ability to understand what they 're trying to do . In every job that I had , I was very careful to get it right with the engineer at the early stages . What do you think of young people now who go through school and then they earn their living producing things that they sell at fairs ? In terms of numbers , it does n't represent very much . I think it 's fabulous for those who want to do it , but I do n't think that 's the ultimate end . When I worked as a designer , it bothered me that I did n't have authorship . The autonomy you have when you fashion the material , design the piece , build it and present it to an audience-where you have full control-do n't you think that 's the difference between being a craftsman and a designer ? I guess that is similar to the difference between an illustrator and a fine arts painter . Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter , but he did postage stamps . And Saturday Evening Post covers . Everything . I talked to him many times . I think he felt he had more impact with the stuff going out to 10,000 people than he did with one painting stuck in a museum . Then it 's about the size of the audience . You see designers as people who bring these ideas to bigger and bigger audiences ? I do . That 's their main function . You want to work across the spectrum . You think a person can be an artist , a craftsman and a designer all at once ? That 's right . I 'll do whatever I need to go across the spectrum . Are you an artist when you 're doing things for other people or only when you 're doing things for yourself ? It 's a matter of how creative it is , regardless of where it 's headed . So it 's got to be expressive , no matter what . It 's the quality of what he or she does . A person can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a one-off thing , a single object for himself . Whatever , it has to move beyond the norm right away . It has to move out in some direction . Venturing . Constantly probing in all directions , trying to find what else is new or where else you can go . It might only be indirect qualities . Like music , the probing into sounds that takes masses of people with it . Immediacy . Do you expect that from visual art ? I do n't see why it should n't be in everything . If that Jazz punch bowl of mine carried the quality that I had in mind-this funny blue light in New York in 1931 when Cab Calloway 's band was playing-that 's what I tried to suggest . I think it has a jazz-of-thatera quality , which it evokes when you see it again . It takes you beyond just the decoration . If you went to a craft fair , would you expect that kind of energy in the work there ? I would hope at least from a few . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm always looking for something that goes beyond the mechanics . Right , but when the mechanics are bad how do you feel ? If it 's intentionally made bad I do n't like it . I want the makers to do the best that they can , but so many see a virtue in crudeness . Do you think that something can be very direct and still have mastery ? It does n't have to be slick or tight , does it ? Not slick , but I hate distorted things just for distortion 's sakespouts that do n't pour , things of that sort . If something is absolutely nasty or Why not , if that 's the intent ? But not taking a chair and deliberately making it nasty . It has to do with the human form and how the chair should express whether it goes in a doctors office or the lobby of a hotel . We designed a lot of dinnerware for restaurants .
