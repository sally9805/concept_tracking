<p> The tables are full ; the expense-account crowd hovers near the reservation desk . It 's lunchtime at Georgia Brown 's , and the air is charged . It 's not just a place to eat ; it 's a stage on which to see and be seen . <p> The first thing you notice is the colors : the honey-hued walls , the golden wood , the sensuous bronze branches that snake across the ceiling . A waiter passes with a palette of yellow corn , coral shrimp and russet gravy . Even the customers blend seamlessly , as if they too are part of some grand decorating scheme , creamy pink to mahogany brown . <p> In a city divided into black and white , Georgia Brown 's looks like a picture of Washington as it would like to be : sophisticated , prosperous , effortlessly interracial . The common draw is Southern cuisine , which is not a black thing or a white thing but a food thing , consumed and debated with equal passion and authority by anyone with roots south of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subtext is that business savvy and credit cards come in all colors . Since it opened a few blocks from the White House 15 months ago , the restaurant has attracted a long list of celebrities , lawyers , lobbyists , Clinton staffers , District pooh-bahs , yuppies and buppies . <p> The success of Georgia Brown 's reveals a peculiar irony of Washington life : What looks like a casual intersection of whites and African Americans was in fact a careful business calculation . The idea was to create a restaurant with more than a token sprinkling of whites or blacks in the dining room . Investors  --  half of them white and half black  --  thought they could make a pile of money . Integration  --  what a concept . <p> Even in a year when the mayoral campaign split the city down racial lines , Georgia Brown 's has remained common ground . <p> Gather round , all you would-be entrepreneurs . This is a story about timing , Tabasco and the art of making money . How black and white make green . <p> Rock Newman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi farm-raised catfish . <p> " I think D.C. men are mostly country boys trying to be city boys , " he says , dropping into his best drawl . " Georgia Brown 's squarely satisfies our cu-li-nary desires . " <p> On this busy Friday afternoon in late September , Newman and his buddy Marion Barry have stopped by to have lunch with an international grain trader named Mamadi Diane . But first , the Democratic nominee for mayor makes a promenade through the restaurant , going from table to table , black to white to black , pumping hands . " You live in the District ? " he repeats , asking for votes , working the room . <p> He plops down at Table 80 , which is in the center of the restaurant , right next to Table 81 , otherwise known as Vernon Jordan 's table , although Jordan is not here today . Newman orders catfish , Diane shrimp and grits , and now Barry dives into his vegetable plate . <p> " I like it because it 's what I call light Southern cuisine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a lot of grease . " He pauses . Now he 's done it . Lost the heavy-grease voters . " I like both , now . " <p> That gentle breeze wafting through the room is undoubtedly the investors breathing a sigh of relief . Restaurants are fashion statements , too . Marion Barry in the center of this room is an endorsement of more than the food . <p> Until the D.C. mayoral primary this fall , when politics reared its ugly side , things at Georgia Brown 's had been just peachy  --  good business , good fun . But as the race card flipped back and forth  --  Who was the tool of business interests ? Who was most black ?  --  there were those who wondered if a restaurant that serves collard greens on white tablecloths , a place predicated on the notion that we all could just get along , was too fragile to withstand the harsh realities of Washington . <p> On the day after the primary , the day Barry told " white people who have whatever hang-ups they have , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington was this close to a serious racial split ... well , that 's the day Barry and his wife , Cora Masters Barry , casually strolled into Georgia Brown 's for an afternoon snack and proceeded to playfully tease restaurant partner Paul Cohn , who supported Sharon Pratt Kelly , schmooze Ward 2 council member Jack Evans and plant a " BARRY " button on Ward 4 council member Charlene Drew Jarvis . <p> On this perfect autumn afternoon , Barry 's back again and Georgia Brown 's is packed with happy-looking people . Maybe it 's the glow of racial harmony . Or maybe it 's the creamy white grits . <p> Two women  --  one white , one black  --  linger at their table . Sally Thompson and Daisy Nappier work in the communications department at the American Consulting Engineers Council . They eat at the restaurant two , three times a month , mostly with clients . A business lunch was canceled at the last minute , so they decided to treat themselves to the reservation . <p> Nappier is a big fan of the mashed potatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grits . " I have never tasted grits like these . It 's the kind of food ... " she closes her eyes , searching for the right word " ... you moan when you eat . " <p> ' I Knew It Could Work ' <p> You could call Paul Cohn an antenna . He picks up trends when they are faint rustlings and beams them out in clear , strong signals . <p> Cohn , director of development at Capital Management and Development Corp. , is the brains behind some of Washington 's most successful restaurants : J. Paul 's , Paolo 's , the River Club , Old Glory and Notte Luna . <p> He opened J. Paul 's , a " dining saloon , " when the bar scene was starting to fade . He tapped the Italian trattoria market with Paolo 's , featuring wood-burning pizza ovens and huge front windows open to the street . The River Club gave aging swingers a place to have dinner and dance , and Old Glory brought serious barbecue and country music to Georgetown . Notte Luna was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if locals and tourists would travel a few blocks east for upscale Italian food . They would . <p> In 1990 , Cohn got a visit from Rod Gaines , a longtime friend . Gaines , once in charge of worldwide food services for TWA , had an idea for a restaurant : Southern food in an upscale setting . " There was a pretty obvious hole in the market in a city that is essentially Southern , " says Gaines . Cohn came up with the name Georgia Brown 's ; Gaines pulled together a business plan ; three tasting parties were held at the River Club for potential investors  --  black and white . The plan projected a cost of $ 1 million to open somewhere in Georgetown or downtown . <p> " The whole idea was to have a place where people of different ethnic groups would feel comfortable , " says Gaines . The existing crop of restaurants tipped heavily toward white or black ; they were not truly integrated . " Not in any real way . If you talk about one or two people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction , I would say no . " <p> Everyone said they thought it was a great idea , but no one was willing to invest . Restaurants are notoriously risky in the best of circumstances . " Some people said to me that downtown Washington was a place where a black-owned business would not be embraced by the white community , " Gaines says . " Some people thought it was too ambitious an idea . " Gaines tried to sell the idea for three months , then moved to Los Angeles , where he 's now in the banking business . <p> In the meanwhile , Cohn  --  a 53-year-old Jewish guy from Baltimore  --  was preparing to open Notte Luna , designed to appeal to a funky downtown crowd . <p> This was his first property outside Georgetown since he ran the Rocket Room and the Mark IV supper club . That was back in the ' 60s and ' 70s , before he left the nightclub business to manage singers Peaches &; Herb . He made a fortune  --  their first album in 1978 sold 5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gold and platinum records on his wall and connections with just about everybody in this town . <p> Restaurants , music  --  they 're both a form of show business . So Cohn got back into the business with J. Paul 's and found new success as the creative force behind a string of hit restaurants . <p> Last year , Cohn called Gaines and told him the company was going ahead with the Georgia Brown 's idea . <p> " I knew it could work , " says Cohn . " It took me three years to convince other people that it would work . " <p> The Deal <p> Location , location , location . The deal , like most things involving real estate , was decided by location . Georgia Brown 's finally got off the ground because another restaurant went under . <p> The McPherson Grill survived four years , closing abruptly in March 1992 . The sleek art deco dining room on 15th Street between I and K streets anchored a large office building managed by the Oliver Carr Co . The high-priced restaurant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chalked up as another victim of the recession . <p> The Carr Co. approached Cohn with a sweetheart deal . It basically gave him the space and everything in it at no cost  --  furniture , kitchen stoves , tablecloths  --  and offered a very attractive lease . <p> Cohn did some quick calculations . With this deal , it would cost him a third of the normal price to open a restaurant this size : about $ 650,000 to renovate the interior , hire a staff , test the menu and open the doors . Three years ago , he had had doubts about a downtown location , but Notte Luna proved it could work . " It did n't take a genius to figure out this was a good location if the concept was right . " <p> The concept was Georgia Brown 's . It evoked Southern , right in the spirit of Bill Clinton 's down-home inauguration . It was cuisine , not soul food , which might have attracted only black customers . But it was n't a name like the Dixie Grill , because ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant with Dixie over the door . <p> Cohn had the location . He had the concept . There was just one more thing : He needed black investors to draw black customers . <p> But black investors had reservations . " I had people say , ' Oh , a white girl 's going to be your chef ? ' I said , ' Why not ? She grew up in the South . ' " <p> George Murray , who made a rather nice fortune in the electronics business , and attorney Bill Jarvis , nephew of Charlene Drew Jarvis , signed on for almost half of the action . Cohn and Capital Management own the rest . <p> The word went out . Vernon Jordan plays golf with Murray ; of course he 'd drop by for lunch . Jarvis called his aunt , who invited her friends . " I wanted to help make it a viable entrepreneurial venture , " she says . " Which it is . " Cohn had a friend who worked at the White House ; he told his friends . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and food , for friends and friends of friends . " We count on word of mouth , " says Cohn . The reviews were good  --  not great , but good enough . <p> You can tell if a restaurant is going to catch on in three or four months . Cohn had a hit . " You can feel it , " he says . " You can feel the energy . " <p> People came , and then came back with black and white friends . " It 's mixed racially , but more important to me I see a mixture of the classes , " says Cora Masters Barry . How many working-class folks are springing $ 50 for lunch for two remains unknown , but Georgia Brown 's did $ 3 million in its first year . The investors are pleased . Very pleased . <p> ' I Do n't Want Nouvelle-Cracker ' <p> The restaurant business is a horrible profession . Long hours . Temperamental chefs . Sick waiters . Crabby customers . Better you should get an accounting degree . <p> But if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it right . A hit , like Georgia Brown 's , is worth studying . Here are the elements that make this restaurant hot : <p> It got famous faces in the door . Ted Koppel . Janet Reno . Denzel Washington . Art Monk . Cokie Roberts . Sam Nunn . Jesse Jackson . David Brinkley . Wesley Snipes . When rhythm and blues crooner Luther Vandross wanted to throw a " Thank-You From Luther " dinner for local radio executives , Georgia Brown 's closed for the night . <p> Some call it smart business . Some call it sucking up to the high and mighty . " We 've certainly done our share , " Cohn says with a laugh . But these are different times ; celebrity care and feeding in Washington is n't what it used to be . There was a time when exclusive little French restaurants slobbered all over the big names and snubbed everybody else . But now they 're out of business . To be sure , a famous face is rewarded , but so is loyalty . " For regular guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differently , " says Cohn . " There 's no question about that . " <p> It 's the demographics , stupid . Lydia Cole , vice president of program management for Black Entertainment Television , heard about the restaurant from colleagues and told Laverne Perry of Epic Records , who told Vandross , who invited 60 of his Washington pals . " It seems to be sort of the in place to go now , " says Cole . " I think for a career-track black professional , it has a lot to do with being a black-owned or partially black-owned business . " <p> Ninety percent of the business is executives , lobbyists , music folks , union leaders and all the people in the District Building and White House who do lunch . " This is serious middle-class demographics , " says Cohn . " We 're appealing to people 25 and over who have money . " <p> It 's down-home cooking , but it definitely does n't look like home . There are other Southern restaurants  --  Southside 815 , Vidalia , the Dixie Grill  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sleek . Sun streams through the picture windows on snowy white tablecloths . <p> Waves of wood weave through the room , creating lots of booths and corner tables for people to see and be seen . This is restaurant as theater , where everyone  --  the multiracial staff , the cooks in the big open kitchen  --  assumes whatever role seems most useful or amusing at the moment . <p> Jazz floats down ; conversation filters up . There is a deliberate buzz here , as if something important is happening even when it is n't . <p> Do n't mess with Mama 's food . Georgia Brown 's arrived with the comfort food craze , which is essentially the kind of dishes Mama used to make . <p> The menu was specifically created to attract a racially mixed clientele . The food is Low Country Southern , cuisine from the Sea Island region of South Carolina , which was influenced by black African slaves , Sephardic Jews and French Huguenots . We 're talking seafood , succulent meats , biscuits , gravy and lots of tradition  --  with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk a very delicate line , " says former Carter White House spokesman Jody Powell , a Georgia native . " This type of food is like hymns in church . You do n't mind a new one every now and then , but most of the attraction is the familiarity and nostalgia . I do n't want nouvelle-cracker . The fact that black and white eat there is testament to the fact that they kept it genuine . " <p> There are those who swear that the Great Collard Greens Flap was a brilliant public relations stunt  --  or maybe it just turned out that way . <p> Three weeks after the doors opened in July 1993 , customers were seeing red over the crunchy collard greens . Chef Cindy Wolf said she just wanted to jazz up an old dish . Instead of boiling the greens for hours , she cooked them quickly . <p> " I had people just walk out because of that , " says Cohn . " We wanted to do something different , but people said , ' My mother did n't make greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " <p> Folks told folks , and pretty soon everyone was talking about it . Now , of course , Georgia Brown 's offers it both ways . And the Tabasco sauce , initially served in a fancy little dish with a spoon , was quickly replaced with the traditional bottle . <p> A Taste of D.C. <p> If only food , service , decor and celebrity customers were enough . But , no , there 's no rest . Hot restaurants can cool off unless they get lots of publicity . Georgia Brown 's does n't do much advertising , but hosts a number of charity receptions and promotions . <p> Cohn sits on the city 's business advisory panel and on the D.C. Committee to Promote . He supported Kelly in the primary race , but co-hosted a " unity breakfast " for Marion Barry last month . <p> On this night , there 's a reception for the " Taste of D.C. , " a restaurant festival on Pennsylvania Avenue . Orange and yellow balloons float in front of the picture windows . A jazz combo plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance . Mayor Kelly , finished with the rigor of campaigning , makes an appearance . <p> " The city is diverse , " says D.C. Council member Harold Brazil . " You like to come to a place that better mirrors that diversity . " <p> It 's a gorgeous autumn dusk , and the big windows are flung open . The music drifts across 15th Street , across to the line of homeless men in McPherson Square lined up for the van that will bring them dinner . <p> Their faces are beige and cocoa and ebony , too . Some places , race is the dividing factor  --  but not on either side of this street . The only color that counts on this street is the color of money .
