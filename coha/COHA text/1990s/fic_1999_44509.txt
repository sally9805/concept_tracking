ON HIS WAY HOME FROM <p> CompUSA with the latest overdrive processor and another 128 megs of RAM chips in the tiny trunk of his Alfa Romeo , Barton Needles cruised slowly past the high school and gazed through the chainlink fence at his so-called peers . It was a scene that should have set him tingling with nostalgia , like something out of a PG13 teen romance movie : sociable kids taking lunch in the quadrangle , running laps on the track , throwing themselves at football dummies , laughing and shouting . But as the bell rang , calling the students back to classes , Barton mouthed the word " Losers , " and stepped on the gas . <p> At home , he slung his backpack under the computer desk and nudged the mouse to kill the screensaver , which played continuous looped demos of his personal online Gorefest victories . A dozen e-mails sprang onto the screen , all received since that morning . He idly scrolled and deleted with one hand while gnawing at a tortilla smeared with peanut butter and jelly - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There were three messages from GoreX : more optimistic notes on business plans and the revised royalty offer for the Skulpulper total conversion . Total bullshit was more like it . He would never work for them again , despite the latest personal pleading e-mail from Tom Ratchip , GoreX 's owner : " Bart , I am asking you as a friend and as your biggest fan to please reconsider your unreasonable position . " <p> It took him about five seconds to type in , one-fingered , " TTML , AW " and sent the message . Talk To My Lawyer , Ass-Wipe . In other words , his dad . <p> Ironically , Ratchip had forwarded a handful of semiliterate messages from delirious gamers , praising Skullpulper in what passed for gushing flattery . " wOOpee ! Man thass kewl ! " " Barton Needles is GOD ! " " wtf is Needles doin workin on TCs ? IMHO he shud have have his own fkn company - and prolly will ! " <p> My sentiments exactly , Barton thought ; and how odd of Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was magnanimous of him . <p> He deleted the fan transmissions as fast as he could scan them , holding back only on the last message , caught by its surprisingly formal structure - not to mention the absence of spelling errors . <p> With stunning architecture , fantastic textures , terrifying new monsters and brilliant new skins for existing monsters , everything about Skullpulper is an improvement on the original game . This is the best Total Conversion we have seen of any game . Given that it is a TC of Gorefest , the reigning blockbuster , this means that Skullpulper is now the best 3D game in the world . Period . <p> Barton leaned a bit closer to the screen , cramming the last of the tortilla into his mouth . Was this an advance review ? - something from an upcoming issue of PC Gamer , maybe ? <p> Then he saw that it had n't been forwarded from GoreX after all . The return address read simply : " n01@noware.org . " Mildly weird . Orgs were generally , what , nonprofit groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Skullpulper fan heading up an organized religion was amusing . Like getting fanmail from the Pope . <p> He continued scrolling through the letter , but the praise of Skullpulper was confined to one paragraph . The next one was far more intriguing : <p> Because of your obvious brilliance , Mr. Needles , we are writing to inquire as to your team 's availability for another total conversion project . <p> My team , he thought . That would be me , myself and I. <p> We have acquired from a third party developer the code to what we consider an extraordinary game . The original program has never been released , and due to legal complications can not be published or otherwise distributed in its current form . While the source code may not be altered in any manner , we believe that would make your task all the easier . You need not concern yourself with programming or behavior issues , but merely convert the outward appearance of existing game elements . We believe you could accomplish this quite rapidly , and we are prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly respond to this e-mail with a simple affirmation ( and the appropriate information regarding your financial institution ) , we will be delighted to demonstrate our intentions by immediate electronic deposit of a onethird advance into any account you specify . Once you have verified the availability of the funds and consented to this project , we will forward everything you need to commence the conversion . You may use your own utilities if you prefer ; but we will provide all textures , skins , and entity models for conversion . You may work independently and at your own speed ( keeping in mind that time is of the essence ) , transferring files to us only when you are pleased with them . We will compile the files and , of course , take full responsibility for the ultimate conversion . <p> Barton was sitting down by the time he 'd read this far . Could this be real money ? The GoreX boys were a bunch of cheapshit assholes . The artists and programmers were okay , but a bunch of suits had taken over the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had done nothing but try to chisel him down and cheat him out of a profit from the moment they 'd realized they had a wildfire hit on their hands something that might give the original game , Gorefest , a run for its money . <p> If these Noware people were serious , he was prepared to put together something that would blow away even Skullpulper . It would be supremely satisfying to snatch the ground out from GoreX . <p> He 'd have to top himself , work harder than he had on Skullpulper , and of course it all depended on the raw materials he had to work with . He could n't imagine how some nonprofit organization had come up with decent code - let alone code competitive with what was already on the market - but they seemed serious . No harm in seeing how serious . <p> Barton composed a one-letter reply- " Y " - and regretted having to mar its perfect symmetry by appending his clunky account information . <p> At 4:17 he sent the message . At 4:26 , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a pint of espresso ice cream , a reply was waiting in the mailbox : " Electronic deposit complete . " <p> Was this for real ? No organization worked that fast . There were committees , accountants , people who filled out the requests and submitted them to others who had authority , and on and on . <p> He connected to his bank . Checking deposits . There was something new , today 's date , timeclocked at 4:22 p.m . <p> At first the amount itself did n't register . Until he saw the dollar sign in front of it , he thought it was his account number . It had almost that many digits . <p> " Well , the money 's clear , but I ca n't get a lead on these Noware people , " his father announced the next evening over dinner . <p> " Keep trying , " Barton instructed . " I 'll start work on the TC . Put that money somewhere nice and warm where it can breed . I wo n't touch it yet . I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be eating with you two for a while . " <p> " What about school ? " his mother asked . " Have you given any thought to going back ? " <p> " Did you see the size of that deposit ? " his father asked . " At this point , for what Barton wants to do , school has become irrelevant . " " This conversation has become irrelevant , " Barton said , pushing away from the table . <p> He went to his room and organized his desk to the tune of explosions and screams from Gorefest battles . He meant to replace the screensaver with a Skullpulper deathmatch , but so far he had n't done much online battling in his own game . The TC had only been available for a week ; he 'd been busy . <p> He decided that before beginning on the Noware project , he would treat himself to one last Skullpulper battle - one that would leave his name ringing in the ears of the Pulper community . It was time to liquefy a few skulls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Gore World , the network of servers dedicated to endless Gorefest and Skullpulper online wars . It took about a second to find a battle in progress ; he mouseclicked on a maelstrom icon and was sucked right in . <p> " Lord Needles enters fray , " said a little voice in the headset , barely audible above the screams of his first victim . He was in the best of his own deathmatch levels , " The Killing Floor " - three stories of metal ramps and catwalks with adjoining corridors that wove in and out of each other . The Killing Floor was a Mobius strip , a hollow hypercube ; you could walk through a gate at one end of a room and find yourself coming in at the far side of the same room . There were ten players already in the map , and as soon as news spread that Lord Needles had jumped in , the number of players joining from other sites began to soar . It topped at thirty-six-the max limit for this level - and by then things were getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it respawned . <p> From his first victim - a startled blur of neon colors with a human face , quickly transformed into beautifully rendered chunks of flying meat - he had liberated a stomp-gun and an ammo pack . As orange streaks of firebolts began to seek him on his ledge , he spied a lift just rising past . He leapt aboard , riding the platform two levels up , clearing catwalks of upright figures and strewing the room with a rain of bloody meat . <p> Within seconds he had the high-ground . A Tesla-cannon floated in midair , just out of reach , but for Lord Needles it was money in the bank . A normal jump would fall short , and leave you plunging to the Killing Floor below , which rippled periodically with gnashing spikes as the walls closed in and caught anyone not fortunate enough to have rocket-jumped onto a ledge . Lord Needles turned his back to the gun , slid until his heels were at the edge of empty air , then fired the stomper at the nearest wall . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap ; in midflight , with a clang , he snagged the Tesla , then came down smack on a suit of glowing armor that snapped into place around him . He held his fire until the level was full again , crawling with gamers hoping for a shot at him . They 'd all go to bed happy tonight , bragging of how they 'd actually been reduced to ground-round by Lord Needles himself . <p> The world is good , he thought . This one , anyway . <p> " Who 's building your levels ? " he queried nOl . " If you want an exciting , comprehensive package , full of traps and murderous surprises , I 'm a skilled mapper as well . I can do more than just straight conversion . " <p> " We understand that you are an excellent level designer , " nOl replied via e-mail . " However , the world is already complete in every respect . It merely needs total conversion , element by element . Please restrict yourself to that task . " <p> Oh well . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game yet that could n't stand to be improved  --  unless it was one of his own . <p> Barton saw no reason not to use the same procedures he 'd used when converting Gorefest into Skullpulper . You built a world up from the basics . Code was more basic than textures , but he did n't have access to that . So he 'd start with textures , then do models ( and the sounds that went with them ) , and finally ( best for last ) invent a new armament . <p> " The number of textures in the game is immense , " a message from nOl had informed him . " However , if you will kindly assemble the elements of a new visual language , we have utilities to employ your textures as the basis for an almost infinite variation of new patterns . " <p> So they took shortcuts , but that was kewl . So did he . Even his rushjobs still had the definitive Needles look . With the money he was making , he could have afforded to hire a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renaissance kid . This was to be his vision , start to finish . <p> He began with a tile , 64 by 64 pixels square , blown up to fill his screen . One pixel at a time , he began to shade and sketch and manipulate until he had an interesting texture . He used his much-hacked version of Mickey 's MasterPaintez , a Disney painting program he 'd been using for all his art projects since he was six years old . Sometimes he started with a blank tile ; more often he worked from an existing image - such as a photograph or a modified tile from Skul.pulper . He designed brown panels striated with darker lines , punctuated with knotholes like long , torn , gaping faces . He made tiles of grainy gray and speckled brown , poking up from matted green , to serve as rocky ground and sparse vegetation . He created panels set with gruesome demonic faces , leering fanged gargoyles . Mushroomhued alien textures . Metal meshwork smeared with what looked like old , rotten blood . Tessellated grids clotted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want in a world . <p> After days of unbroken work , Barton began to see his custom textures everywhere . This always happened in the middle of a project . When he lay down to snatch a few hours of sleep , colored tiles replicated themselves on the undersides of his eyelids , wallpapering the interior of his brain with riveted blue panels , ocher brickwork , coppery asphalt . When he woke and wandered upstairs for more of the sugary espresso fuel he craved , the walls seemed to crawl with patterns he had designed . The biggest difference between the visual content of his dreams and his waking hours was the lack of a monitor framing his dreams . And sometimes he dreamed the monitor as well . <p> It was more than a week before he had a complete set of textures he was happy with - the makings of a new world . He gathered the files into a single pack , zipped it up , and e-mailed it to Noware . That was at 3:14 a.m. on a Saturday . <p> Just before noon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , there was a message from nOl waiting in his mailbox . He expected , at worst , a mere confirmation : Textures received . At best , the usual raves . What greeted him was both unexpected and unwelcome . <p> Excellent work , Mr. Needles ( may we call you Lord ? ) ! Many of these are everything we had hoped for , and should serve to fill in every aspect of our game . However , we note that overall there is a certain grim , even cruel , quality to the work . We discern little of lightness here , little of humor or human kindness <p> " Human kindness ? " he said with a sleepy snarl . " What is this shit ? " <p> We are therefore returning certain textures which we consider inappropriate for this conversion , and request that you kindly recast them with a somewhat more benign demeanor . It is our intention that this game be significantly less grueling and gruesome than the usual fare . We believe our conversion will find a ready niche in a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this message was a file comprised of every tile that was even slightly macabre or sinister : the demon faces , the gory floors , the gears clogged with flesh . <p> In Barton 's first flush of disgust and indignation , he started a letter like those he had fired at GoreX toward the end of the Skullpulper conversion , letting his venom shape and seethe through every bitter sentence . But gradually he found himself reconsidering such a rash response . If Noware had stated their intentions at the outset , he could have told them to flick off before agreeing to their terms . But now ... the money . Yes , the money , already beginning to bubble yeastily and rise like wonderful dough , inflating .... <p> In the end , he deleted the letter . <p> Why had they picked him for the TC ? They knew his work - they 'd praised it . Had they sought him out with the ulterior intention of subverting his natural style ? He still suspected they were some sort of quasi-religious outfit . Maybe it was Barton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't touch him . He would do what they asked , but in the end he would have his way . In the end it would be Lord Needles 's world . <p> He treated the revision work with economical disdain , devising a program to switch the goriest tones of clotted blood with soothing pinks , soft blues , subdued nursery-room yellows . The multitude of fierce icons were more difficult to alter , but he devised a fractal filter that softened and blurred the masks of evil , then re-sharpened them into whimsical forms . Wicked spikes and jagged fangs softened into curls and spirals like multicolored rotelle pasta . The grimly leering slits of demon-serpent eyes became cheerful crescent moons mounted on the fuzzy cheeks of smilingsnouted orange teddy bears . <p> Barton reserved the serpent smirks for himself . And carefully laid the groundwork for his subversive masterpiece . <p> The batch of revised textures , fired back at Noware approximately 12 hours after their rejection , met with no further objection : " Textures received . More than acceptable . Please commence entity conversion based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message was accompanied by an immense collection of . mdl files . Once he began to examine the files , he was disappointed to find how utterly unimaginative they were . <p> No monsters . No aliens . No marine sergeants frothing bloody foam . <p> Instead , he found people , all sizes and shapes and colors , all ages , but all utterly ordinary . The fact that they were naked was the strangest thing about them . Game models were usually decked in flamboyant colors , military garb , savage armor . So the nakedness of these was odd ... but ultimately boring . <p> His first task , therefore , was to make the models interesting again . That should be no problem . There were enough similarities in the basic human forms that one good all-purpose program would be able to remake the entire tedious population on a global basis . <p> On a whim , and for consistency 's sake , he went back to the image of the stupid cuddly teddy bear he had concocted for his tiles . Having settled on a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files , altering all of them in one sweep , creating a motley army of awkward , patchy teddy bears . He spent the next day tweaking them individually , keeping limbs aligned and furry snouts smiling . <p> The next group of models was harder to comprehend : batches of limbs , unattached to any creature ; horns and fur and scales . There were machine parts , things that looked like the hoods of generic midsized cars , lampstand bases , twigs and fronds . He no longer had any idea what he was altering . He followed his own sense of style , hoping to make all these oddments look as if they shared some common source ; he teased the limbs into long strings and let them snap back into floppy curls . He turned gentle arcs into spadelike parabolas . He had never worked in the dark like this before , guided only by a sense of rightness ; but after a time he found it addictive . He enjoyed the alterations for their own sake , without a thought to their purpose or ultimate use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to . Days passed ; and , more importantly , nights , when he hardly stirred from his seat . But while he reveled in the work , his plans for revenge were far from forgotten . <p> All the grimness , all the cruelty , that was such an essential element of everything he 'd done before the Noware TC , he carefully set aside for a private project . It was to be a secret entity , something made all the more hideous by contrast to the warm and whimsical creatures which surrounded it . <p> Barton distilled his conception of evil into a hybrid bearing the worst features of every monster he had ever wrought or dreamed of . A Demon Lord . In scale , it was several hundred times the size of the human figures ; it was gray and black and dripping with blood ; its maw a festering pocket of abscessed fangs and sucking lamprey tongues . Its body was a slimy mass of chancres from which razor-hooked tendrils uncurled , and it moved on a carpet of insect legs that could adhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armor , and was all but unstoppable . He decided to include one and only one - weapon in the artillery pack which , if cleverly used , might kill it . <p> The hardest thing was finding the right sound for the beast . He experimented for days until hitting upon a satisfactory noise , achieved by feeding glass and bone and masses of sinewy fat into the kitchen sink garbage disposal and recording the gurgling , grinding sound with a microphone taped to the plumbing down where the razors whirled . By raising this to an almost intolerably high pitch , he captured what sounded like a scream of demonic triumph . <p> The Demon Lord would be Barton Needles 's signature . Anyone who played the game would recognize his handiwork as soon as the monster devoured them . <p> But naturally he could not simply e-mail the Demon Lord to nOl@noware.org and expect accolades . He could imagine their shock and horror , and then their polite rejection . Well , he would not give them a chance to reject it before letting them know what he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there would be a good long reign of carnage . <p> Noware had unknowingly delivered the means of its undoing into his hands . The original collection of models had been accompanied by a large DLL file - a dynamic link library containing a number of animation and other routines shared by many of the models . Changes to the models necessitated changes to the animation functions ; and Noware had entrusted him with this rudimentary programming task . <p> He compressed his Demon Lord data and hid the unlabeled array among others in the DLL . He then found an ordinary animation function , one that would be called fairly frequently during runtime , and made one minor alteration : at random intervals the normally useful function would return a pointer not to an ordinary animation function , but to the Demon Lord array . The game would then decompress , load , and let loose the monster . <p> If Noware eventually did locate the monster array and tried to remove it , all model animations would fail . Meanwhile , it was self-triggering , and would spawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creatures were not killed , there would be hordes of them all through the game . By then , of course , the hard-core gamers would have risen to the challenge and mastered the tricks of the arsenal . <p> On the other hand , no hard-core gamer of Barton 's experience would spend more than two minutes in this particular world anyway . With all its soft edges and pastel colors , it would repel them instantly . It was just as well he was working anonymously . A world like this would be death to his reputation ... except for the Demon Lord aspect . <p> He would do things differently next time . Not that there need be a next time . Once he 'd been paid in full for the Noware TC , he would have the capital he needed to start his own company , with a few hand-picked employees . He 'd rent an office on the cheap end of Water Street , and a renaissance of coolness would surely crystallize around his arrival . He 'd buy a new car ... something fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to think along those lines . <p> He packed up the model files and shipped them off to Noware . The money was almost his . Nothing remained now but to create or convert an arsenal of weapons , an immensely enjoyable task after so much tiptoeing around . It was hard to imagine how even the grubs at Noware could expect him to make chainguns and rocket launchers seem sweet and innocent . Ultimately , a weapon was a weapon , even if it shot marshmallows and had a fuzzy pink handgrip . <p> Acknowledgment arrived no more than forty-five minutes after he 'd sent off the models . <p> Dear Lord Needles : <p> Thank you for delivery of your model pack . The models appear more than satisfactory  --  certainly there is nothing in the least offensive or inappropriate here ; further minor modifications can be attended to by our staff if necessary . We have deposited the balance of your payment in the account you previously specified . We thank you for your participation in our TC , and look forward to working with you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Barton 's surprise was enormous . He typed a hasty response : " I do n't understand . I 'm still waiting to convert the weapons pack . If you gave that work to someone else I 'll be really p.o. ' d-and you do n't want to p. me o. ! " <p> His fingers slammed and skittered on the keyboard . He smashed the Send button and waited in a fury for nOl 's reply . <p> It came almost instantly : <p> All weapons code has been expunged from source . No weapons in our TC . This is to be a peaceful game as we have previously stated . Thank you again for your participation . All elements are in place , and we have received final approval to embark on Total Conversion immediately . We trust you will be pleased with results . <p> Barton could n't force himself to stay at the screen another moment . He got up snarling and stormed out of his room . <p> It seemed to be morning - what hour exactly , or what day , he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw his face ; then she retreated to the safety of her pots and pans . He rushed out of the house , past his neglected Alfa Romeo . He did n't trust himself to drive right now ; he would kill someone- maybe even himself . Well , he was n't stupid or rash , and he was n't about to take chances like that . He felt as if he had n't been out of the house , or used his legs , or felt the sunlight in weeks . He was not far wrong . <p> Usually - in a deathmatch for instance - rage and thoughts of revenge sharpened his mind , providing a clear black background to his thoughts , allowing him to stalk and slay his enemies with deadly precision . Today , for some reason , murk accompanied the anger . The sky was blue , the streets looked fresh and bright , as if a storm had swept them and moved on ; but his mood clouded everything . He kept surfacing to find that he 'd walked another few blocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trees threw their shadows over him . Up ahead , preschoolers clambered on a climbing structure . A dog chased a Frisbee . Good , he told himself , calmed by the exercise . You 're getting a grip . <p> It was better to plan his next move , and put Noware behind him . He had their money now , that was all that really mattered . With money he could do anything : start his own company , take all the time he needed to make a game that was pure Barton Needles , pure and unadulterated evil . Yes , his next game would be everything the Noware conversion was not . <p> In that moment of anticipatory calm , he realized he had made himself dizzy by rushing out so quickly after weeks of concentrated mental effort . Dizzy and sick . That explained why the world seemed to be rippling-and why he saw his textures everywhere he looked , as if they were pouring out of his eyes again . Maybe it also explained why the pine trees were suddenly wrapped in blue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beaded trickles of sap shimmered with a weird fluorescent orange glow . <p> He headed toward a park bench to sit down , but it was changing , growing narrower at the ends , beginning to sag and spiral into limp dangling curls like the tendrils of a creeping plant . He crouched in the grass and put his head between his knees , eyes shut , hoping his textures would stop crawling over everything he saw . <p> He would get help next time . He would n't try to do it all himself . It was too much for one kid to make over an entire world . He kept his eyes closed until he saw only sparkling darkness , devoid of the self-created patterns he 'd been staring at for weeks . <p> When he opened his eyes , he gazed straight down at the grass and earth underfoot . <p> The grass was red . The earth beneath the blades was purple , faintly shot through with lime . Things were crawling in the soil - things like soft enormous pink ants with floppy legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him even dizzier . As the world spun , he saw it had been completely remade with his textures . He could n't stop seeing them no matter where he looked . The buildings at the far edge of the square were all colors but the proper ones ; they were shaped like enormous saggy mushrooms , puddling on the soft cushions of streets that were not so much paved as upholstered . <p> Barton turned and ran toward home , hoping he could find his way now that he 'd lost his senses . <p> Near the edge of the square , something darted to and fro , dragging a leash across grass that stubbornly refused to revert from red . If he squinted his eyes it was still mostly a dog , but the sound it made was not at all canine . Where had he heard it before ? It shot between his legs , snagging him in the dragging leash . Somewhere in the distance he could hear its owner piping on a weird shrill dog whistle . Hopelessly tangled , Barton fell . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licking . <p> Then he remembered where he had heard the creature 's call . Like the textures , it was something he 'd carried in his head that had somehow spilled out into the world . It was glass and bone and metal and meat , all grinding together in a bottomless bubbling throat . <p> The cries , with all their overtones of impending total victory , grew louder as the Demon Lord overshadowed the square , then dimmed to a muted slurping as the first of many lamprey tongues found his face . <p> Next time they 'll want weapons , Barton thought indignantly . Lots of weapons ! <p> His final conscious act was the unhappy one of seeking his reflection in a million rheumy eyes , but failing . There were no Lord Needles or even Bartons anywhere . <p> All he saw were a million orange teddy bears , screaming . <p> Author Affiliation
