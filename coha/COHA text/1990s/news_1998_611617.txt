<p> The doctors told Sue Lowery her husband 's time was nearly up . But now she watched him across the family dinner table and tried to match his mood of celebration . <p> It had been three years since Tommy Lowery learned he had prostate cancer . <p> Yet on this winter night  --  in the hilltop house he built with his own hands 35 miles south of Birmingham  --  the 57-year-old brick mason laughed and made plans for the spring , surrounded by his children and grandchildren . <p> A medical clinic up in Virginia , the Lowerys say , had promised to deliver what sounded like a miracle : a concentrate from the aloe vera plant , injected into his bloodstream , that would shrink his grapefruit-sized tumor to the size of a pea . The Lowerys say they were told it had worked for dozens of people , and would work for Tommy Lowery , too . <p> Sue Lowery had her doubts  --  their hopes had been raised , and dashed , before  --  but for now she kept quiet . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I stopped him from doing it , would I always regret it ? " <p> They loaded up their car and headed north that same night . But in the Manassas clinic of Donald MacNay , the Lowerys say they found not a miracle cure , but a cruel ordeal . <p> Within two days of beginning intravenous aloe treatments in March 1997 , the family says , Tommy Lowery 's body turned purple and began to swell . The skin on his toes cracked open . He died a painful death , hastened , his hometown doctor believes , by the injections . <p> What happened to the Lowerys and other families from around the country  --  who found their way to Manassas and have told similar stories in interviews with The Washington Post  --  will be at issue Thursday , when the Virginia Board of Medicine considers whether to revoke MacNay 's medical license . <p> In addition to the medical board , federal and state consumer and law enforcement agencies from Texas to Maryland are investigating the clinic and its supplier . Among other things , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims for the medical benefits of aloe it sold to MacNay . <p> MacNay , in a brief interview last September , did not directly answer questions about whether he performed aloe injections . He went on to defend the practice as medically sound and said he had done nothing wrong . He did not respond to telephone messages or to a note left at his home this week . <p> His daughter , Bonnie King , a physical therapist who worked for him part time , has said MacNay believed the injections were legal . <p> Beyond the events in Manassas , the journey of the Lowery family reflects the desperate search made each year by thousands of cancer patients , who are vulnerable to questionable or illegal claims about alternative treatments . Half of all cancer patients now seek out some nontraditional therapy  --  from megavitamins to untested herbal substances  --  feeding a multibillion dollar industry that has been spurred by the ability of the Internet and other new technologies to spread the word . <p> Federal agencies say that although many offers of alternative treatment are honest or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they say the sheer growth has made it impossible for investigators to keep up . <p> Aloe is the subject of optimistic health claims in books , videotapes and on the Web . Several foreign clinics , including one in Mexico , offer aloe injections . A University of Texas study , funded by an aloe company , is investigating whether injections could fight cancer in humans , but any such treatment outside the study is illegal in the United States . <p> The Lowerys say they were led to believe aloe injections by MacNay were sanctioned by federal health authorities . Tommy Lowery had already tried surgery and radiation , followed by a regimen of herbal remedies . Although he knew the aloe therapy was unconventional , he became convinced it could work . <p> " You are always looking for hope somewhere , " Sue Lowery said . " When the doctors say there is nothing they can do , you are searching . " <p> Carrots and Flax <p> The Lowerys are scheduled to testify at the medical board hearings in Richmond . The board suspended MacNay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , intravenous aloe was unlawfully administered to many patients and that his continued practice " may be a substantial danger to the public health and safety . " <p> The clinic also has been temporarily closed . <p> The board 's investigators said they know of three other patients who died shortly after visiting MacNay : Richard F. King , 41 , of Royal Oak , Mich. , who had kidney cancer and went into cardiac arrest in MacNay 's office ; Clarence Holland Lander , 82 , of Waco , Tex. , who had lung cancer and died in MacNay 's office ; and Douglas Crabbe , 48 , of Cecil County , Md. , who suffered from cancer of the esophagus and died a week after treatment in Manassas . <p> In all , The Post interviewed nine families who went to MacNay for intravenous treatment last year . All but one said the therapy failed or made patients ' conditions worse . <p> Jean Johnson , of Leedey , Okla. , whose husband , Dale Johnson , died of cancer four months after being treated , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possibility it could help people , " she said , adding that she was treated well by MacNay . <p> Several families are convinced the treatments killed the men before their time , but in cases involving terminal illness , making such a determination  --  legally or medically  --  is difficult at best . <p> The Lowerys ' search for a cure began long before they heard of aloe . Lowery was used to beating the odds . An eighth-grade dropout and the son of alcoholic parents , he built a thriving brickwork and construction business that financed college educations for three of his children . <p> When the cancer diagnosis came , Lowery announced to his family , " I will never give up , not until there is not a breath left in me . " <p> Even as Lowery received radiation treatments and went in and out of remission , the family collected health books and advice from friends . <p> They embraced a suggestion from " The Cure for all Cancers , " a 1993 book by Hulda Regehr Clark , to clear the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Candles , glue , air fresheners and cleaning supplies all went into the trash . <p> Then they spent $ 425 a month putting Lowery on an intense anti-cancer diet promoted by a California firm , Richard Schulze 's American Botanical Pharmacy . The " New Incurables Program " included Liver/Gallbladder Cleanser and Intestinal Formula #2 , a mix of flax seed , apple pectin and other ingredients . <p> " I would juice three pounds of carrots a day  --  for the beta carotene , " Sue Lowery said . " I burned up four juicers . " <p> Promises on Tape <p> Three months into Tommy Lowery 's herbal diet , the cancer began to spread again . That 's when the family first heard reports of aloe 's anti-cancer powers and obtained a cassette tape , entitled " There is hope ! You do n't have to die ! " about an oral aloe product called T-UP . <p> On the tape , Baltimore businessman Allen Hoffman says that he stumbled upon the cancer treatment while doing research in Baltimore on AIDS patients . <p> The Lowerys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed the batches of official-looking medical literature and promotional material they received , which purport to show that aloe is effective in treating cancer . Within a week of receiving the material , the Lowerys ordered one bottle of T-UP oral treatment to start : $ 100 for two ounces of aloe and accompanying pills . <p> Hoffman states on his tape that although T-UP can be taken orally , it is more effective if injected . But for legal reasons , he continues , that requires a trip out of the country . <p> The juice made Lowery nauseous and gave him diarrhea . When he complained , the family said , Hoffman referred him to MacNay . <p> Hoffman is under investigation by the Maryland Attorney General 's Office and several federal agencies in connection with claims he has made for T-UP , law enforcement sources said . Hoffman told Virginia State Police investigators that he had referred patients to MacNay and furnished him with aloe , according to an affidavit filed in October in Prince William County Circuit Court . <p> In previous interviews , Hoffman has denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reached last week he said , " I ca n't make any comment . " <p> The Lowerys ' daughter , Wendy , said she called MacNay 's office and was reassured by a man she said identified himself as the doctor 's chief medical aide , Ronald R. Sheetz . <p> Sheetz , a former automobile mechanic , is being investigated for allegedly performing an invasive procedure without a license , law enforcement sources said . This week , Sheetz declined to comment on the MacNay case . <p> When Wendy Lowery called , " I told him if this was not on the up-and-up to please let me know . This was Daddy 's last chance . " <p> Ancient Remedy <p> The gel found inside aloe vera 's thick , spiny leaves has been recognized for its healing power for centuries . Alexander the Great is said to have carried it into battle to treat wounded soldiers . <p> Aloe can be found today in dozens of commercial products . Recent interest has focused on its apparent ability to affect the immune system . <p> A 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumors in some dogs and cats . It and other studies led the federal government in 1991 to give conditional approval for an aloe product that treats a type of animal cancer . <p> But the animal studies also found that , in certain doses or in certain forms , aloe could be deadly to mice and even horses . <p> Research on humans has been more limited . A 1980 University of Texas study found that , in a lab dish , an aloe extract stimulated growth of normal human cells but had no effect on the growth of human tumor cells . <p> Aloe would need extensive testing before it could be considered for a human cancer drug . One such review is underway at the University of Texas Medical School-Houston , but so far the researchers have only determined that the particular aloe extract they are using is not toxic . <p> Much of such animal and human testing has been financed by Carrington Laboratories Inc. , of Irving , Tex. , which dominates the aloe pharmaceutical industry . <p> Carrington 's own executives acknowledge that , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of aloe-based drugs it had under development  --  even suggesting that it might have found a cure for AIDS . The company since has abandoned its AIDS program , said its chief executive , Carleton E. Turner . <p> But the lack of scientific proof has done little to prevent intense speculation that aloe is a miracle drug . <p> In a video titled " Aloe Vera , Nature 's Miracle , " H. Reginald McDaniel , a Texas pathologist and aloe researcher , says aloe " will be the most important single step forward in the treatment of diseases in the history of mankind . " The tape , which the Food and Drug Administration has tried to remove from the market , goes on to discuss how to use aloe to treat AIDS and cancer . <p> McDaniel is frequently cited on aloe-related Internet sites , including one on which Joe Glickman Jr. , of Whitefish , Mont. , sells an aloe-based product called Manapol , which McDaniel helped develop . Glickman says it " fights cancer aggressively . " <p> Roma Egli , an FDA compliance officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotions , which she reviewed at the request of the Post , are " outrageous . . . a fraudulent promotion . " <p> But Egli said that despite being apparently unlawful , such claims would get little immediate attention from her overwhelmed three-member staff , because drinking aloe has not been proved harmful . <p> Glickman said his advice was not misleading . <p> A 1994 federal law allows diet supplements and nutritional products to be marketed without FDA approval , as long as the manufacturer states the ingredients have some history of dietary use and have never been sold in the United States as drugs . But it is illegal for any company to claim that a product can cure or treat a disease , unless it is approved for that purpose . The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission are both charged with enforcing the law . <p> Staff members at the FTC spent one November day touring the Internet in search of misleading health claims . The result was 400 warning letters sent by e-mail , and a warning to the public to watch out for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cures . " <p> Regulators say some claims are outside their jurisdiction because they do n't involve sale of a product . For example , an Imperial Beach , Calif. , man regularly posts messages in Internet discussion areas urging cancer patients to try aloe injections . <p> " Such a simple , direct treatment , next to no side effects , and damn stuff WORKS , " Roger Jones wrote in a message this month . " If it caught on , it 'd be so effective , it 'd put millions of doctors out of work . " <p> Jones said in an interview that he refers people to Gary Tarasov , of San Diego , who runs the Natural Healing Center in Tijuana , Mexico . Tarasov , who says he is a Russian-trained physician , said last week he has had about a 70 percent success rate in treating 45 to 50 patients with T-UP and other herbal cures . <p> ' You Can See Death ' <p> In Manassas last spring , in addition to the Lowerys and Crabbes , at least six other cancer patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling from California , New York , Oklahoma and Texas . Several families stayed in apartments they sublet from MacNay for about $ 350 a week . <p> Sue Lowery and Deanna Crabbe were neighbors in the apartment complex ; they shared prayers and details about their husbands ' worsening conditions . They found little comfort in their temporary homes , which they described as threadbare and cheaply furnished . <p> Treatments of aloe , mixed with cesium chloride , would last for three hours , in the motel rooms , apartments or at MacNay 's office . <p> MacNay , an orthopedic surgeon , received his medical degree in 1962 from Queens University Medical School in Kingston , Ontario . A big , broad-shouldered man with gray hair , MacNay worked at Prince William Hospital from 1969 to 1995 , and until last year ran the Piedmont Orthopedic Clinic in Manassas and Annandale . <p> MacNay also says he specialized in what he called " immune system treatment . " In the brief interview last fall , he declined to discuss individual cases , but explained that aloe could boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumors . <p> Tommy Lowery and Douglas Crabbe became violently ill , each suffering from nausea and diarrhea , and unable to eat . The families , meanwhile , were revolted by what they say were horrible conditions at the clinic : blood spattered on the floor , bathrooms soiled with excrement and some IV tubes hooked on clothes hangers attached to the ceiling . <p> According to the families , the patients ' bodies began to swell , slowly at first , but ultimately so severely that their toes bent out of shape and the skin burst open . Part of this swelling probably was caused by their tumors , which were blocking the flow of blood in their bodies , but the families believed the treatment was only making it worse . <p> The families said MacNay told them he understood the treatment was causing discomfort , but that like chemotherapy , it had to get worse before it would get better . <p> Sue Lowery tried to comfort her husband , rubbing his back and pacing back and forth with him for hours . But at times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the man she had married 39 years earlier , at the age of 14 . <p> One night , she tuned in to a radio station playing 1970s hits , a reminder of better times . <p> " We reminisced about when we first married and did not have enough money to buy a TV , and we were loving , and hugging each other and talking through the night , " she said . <p> After three days of treatment , she confronted MacNay about why things were going so poorly . " Look at him , " she said . " You can see death . Dad is dying . " <p> According to Sue Lowery , MacNay said , " We love him too . We want the best for him . " Then , she said , MacNay " reached out and grabbed onto my hand . " <p> Sue Lowery said she was " disgusted . " She slapped his hand away . <p> " I said , ' You do n't love him . We love him , ' " she said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had paid MacNay about $ 16,000 , including the rent . They drove home April 11 and went immediately to their family doctor , Sara Walker . She said she was shocked to see her patient . <p> " When he left , he still had decent color , he was still functioning , walking , getting out , " Walker said . " But when he came back , he looked like death . He was ashen , he had no color , he could hardly walk , he had a sallow look . The pace of his demise had been accelerated . " <p> Tommy Lowery was hospitalized shortly after returning home , never regaining his confidence that he could beat cancer . <p> On April 30 , three weeks after he left MacNay 's clinic , he was dead . <p> Metro resource director Margot Williams contributed to this report .
