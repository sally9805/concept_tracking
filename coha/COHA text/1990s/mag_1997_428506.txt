Section : News you can use Average Americans , not the super-rich , are the real givers <p> James Chatman considers himself an unlikely successor to the philanthropic legacy of Andrew Carnegie or John D. Rockefeller . " I never had such a dream , " says the 71-year-old retired business consultant from Alexandria , Va . " I was just a poor farm boy . " <p> Chatman grew up fatherless in tiny Atkins , Ark. , where his Uncle Sy promised that he would have time for games " only when lay-by comes . " A period for leisure never seemed to arrive . So Chatman set himself to work  --  first in the fields , then peddling newspapers after he moved as a child to Little Rock , and later working as a bellman at hotels in the segregated South . He worked his way through St. Louis University , earning a degree in economics , served 24 years in the U.S. Air Force , and then applied his skills as a supply-services staff officer to founding Technology Applications Inc. , a consulting firm for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the firm was posting revenues of $40 million a year . <p> Chatman realized that he had more money than he or his four children really needed . So he established a $400,000 fund at the Northern Virginia Community Foundation to create a Grandfathers Group to mentor black boys . " My wife and I really hate the idea of black people seeing ourselves as takers and receivers , and not seeing ourselves also as givers , " he says . <p> As the Chatmans prove , philanthropy is n't just for Gettys anymore . The real face of charity in America today can be found in ordinary people who have benefited from the booming economy and now plan to share a portion of their good fortune with others . Call them the philanthropists next door . <p> They come in many different types . Some are latter-day Horatio Alger heroes who have grown sizable nest eggs through hard work , shrewd investments , and frugal living . Some have cashed in big in the tech-driven stock market of the past decade . And some are unlikely philanthropists such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrimped for years before donating her life savings of $150,000 to a scholarship fund at the University of Southern Mississippi . " When I star out , the typical donor was wealthy , white , male , and dead , " says Lynne Woodman of the Cleveland Foundation . " We are seeing many more living donors from all walks of life . " <p> Community foundations like Cleveland 's are the fastest-growing element of philanthropy in America today . Nationwide , the 500 or so community foundations had assets totaling $17.1 billion in 1996 , a 28.6 percent increase over the previous year . For those plunging into philanthropy for the first time , allying with community foundations offers distinct advantages . Many require as little as $10,000 to set up a named fund that can target a specific project . And foundation staffs often have knowledge of local agencies and the ability to negotiate many of the legal and bureaucratic tangles required in maintaining charitable trusts . <p> Other philanthropists are exploring private family foundations . The New York-based Foundation Center reports that there are 35,600 independent grant-making foundations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations ) , a 42 percent increase since 1987 . <p> Every drop counts . Last year , Americans donated $130 billion to charitable causes , up 9.5 percent in two years ; the majority of donations went to religious institutions . The media played up Ted Turner 's $1 billion gift to the United Nations and financier George Soros 's donations of millions of dollars to Russia and Eastern Europe . But according to one recent study , more than half of all charitable giving comes from Americans earning less than $50,000 a year . And small donors make a difference . " I could n't do anything like Ted Turner , but every drop in the bucket will make the bucket overflow , " says paraplegic Barbara Decker of suburban Cleveland , who used a large malpractice settlement to set up a trust to benefit children 's charities . <p> Researchers see potential for an even more explosive growth in charitable giving thanks to the estates of older Americans who lived through a half century of record prosperity . A 1993 study by two Cornell University economists estimated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot of wealth totaling $10 trillion  --  more than enough to put every American under the age of 21 through Harvard for four years . And while taxes and children will claim a significant portion of that money as that generation passes on ( the federal government now taxes estates over $600,000 at rates up to 55 percent ) , charities are hoping for a big windfall . " We 're at the front edge of a huge generational transfer of wealth , " says Fern Portnoy , a Denver-based adviser on philanthropic giving . <p> Many Americans have been taken by surprise by the amount of wealth they have accumulated . Chatman admits that at first , his success in business made him uneasy : " I always felt that if you made a profit that you were somehow stealing from somebody . " Chatman began to reflect on the purpose of accumulating money . " How do you justify making all this profit ? " he asked . The answer , Chatman found , was to spend the money forging the kind of relationship he had with his Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same business principles to giving away their money that they did to earning it . " For a generation of business people who have become juiced on the deal , the challenge is how you translate that excitement into philanthropy , " says Portnoy . A good example is John Abele , age 60 , who spent the last 20 years helping build Boston Scientific Inc. into a giant in medical technology , with annual sales of $2 billion . Now he splits his time about evenly between company business and philanthropy . <p> Raised in suburban Boston at the tail end of the Depression , Abele lost his father in World War II and spent much of his early childhood in and out of the hospital with osteomyelitis , a bone disease . " They tried an experimental drug on me that did n't work . A few years later , they tried it again and it did work . The experimental drug was penicillin . " Abele never forgot the experience . After studying physics and philosophy in college , he got into the medical-device business and cofounded Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical procedures . <p> The frontiers of charitable work offer similar challenges and rewards . Abele has established his own family foundation , with a $9 million endowment , and is involving his three grown children in the grant-making process . Often his support goes to educational programs like the Concord Review , a 10-year-old quarterly journal that publishes high school essays on history in hopes of elevating the status of the subject and rewarding students for academic achievements . Buoyed by his own experience , Abele now finds himself encouraging other business people to take the plunge into philanthropy . " It should n't be a guilt trip , " he says . <p> Philanthropic projects are not as hard to nurture as they might seem , Abele says . " If you 're going to produce sustainable social value , you have to use the same tools you would apply to any business project , setting benchmarks and then following through , " he says . At first , he admits , he erred by straying from a strict business model . For example , some charities spend too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was important to aim money at the final recipient , " he says , " but programs that cut too short on their leadership have no staying power . " <p> Catherine Muther , a 50-year-old from San Francisco who made her money in Silicon Valley , agrees with the strategic approach to philanthropy . And like many of the younger breed of donors , she seeks out causes that have traditionally been given short shrift in the charitable world . For some , that means environmental or gay rights issues . Muther focuses her charity on improving the lives of women in education and the workplace . <p> With her business background , Muther takes an active interest in targeting her resources , through her own foundation and through restricted gifts to institutions . " It 's trying to understand some structural problem in society  --  like women 's access to capital or young girls ' self-esteem  --  and then figuring out where some resources could be deployed that might influence change , " she explains . <p> The focus of Muther 's philanthropy  --  young women  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up with her three brothers in Newton , Mass. , where she became the first girl in town to deliver newspapers . " The idea of being financially independent was a central value in our family , " she remembers . " And it was n't about accumulating money but learning how to support yourself . " <p> Muther carried that notion with her to Sarah Lawrence College and Cambridge University in England . She had wanted to become a Rhodes Scholar , but the program did not accept women at the time . However , Muther took advantage of the newfound acceptance of women into major business schools . Armed with an M.B.A . from Stanford , Muther headed to Silicon Valley in 1984 and eventually became a senior marketing officer at Cisco Systems , the fast-growing computer networking company . <p> After retiring in 1994 at age 46 , Muther set aside $3 million in profits from Cisco 's stock to establish the Three Guineas Fund . The foundation , named for a favorite book by Virginia Woolf , is launching an " incubator " program to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also funded a fellowship for a female doctoral student to study entrepreneurship at Stanford Business School . <p> Like Abele , Muther hopes to forge giving patterns for her progeny . While she has set up trusts for her two young children , Muther and her husband have stopped making large cash gifts to them . " It 's our belief that one can burden one 's children with wealth , " she says . <p> In many respects , the new philanthropists hark back to an earlier age . Nearly a century ago in his book The Gospel of Wealth , Andrew Carnegie issued a challenge to fellow moneybags to disburse substantial portions of their income during their lifetimes . He even supported levying estate taxes so that the state could better express " condemnation of the selfish millionaire 's unworthy life . " <p> Many argue that the philanthropic spirit Carnegie articulated needs to be reawakened . Studies suggest that Americans on average give just under 2 percent of their annual income to charity  --  a figure that tops other nations ' but that has not budged despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving ) . Moreover , Carnegie 's message has yet to spread widely among the swelling class of ultrarich . Eight of 10 Americans who earn at least $1 million a year leave nothing to charity in their wills , often making Uncle Sam the charity of choice by default . " The vast majority of the very rich show , if anything , less of a philosophical inclination to give than their predecessors , " says Peter Dobkin Hall of the Yale Program on Nonprofit Organizations . <p> Millionaires now account for 3.5 percent of U.S. households , but it does n't take substantial means to become a major donor . Helen Sandfort , a retired schoolteacher living in a retirement home in Columbus , Ohio , set up a fund at the Columbus Foundation in 1981 to support arts education in the public schools . " Young people simply do not know what to do with their time , " says Sandfort , who served as director of fine and performing arts in the city schools for 25 years . " The arts encourage people to be creative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " <p> Though she retired in 1974 , the 87-year-old still contributes each year to the fund , which is now worth $85,000 , and plans to leave a quarter of her estate to the foundation as well . " I have enough to take care of myself , but I have enough to share , too , " says Sandfort , who has no children . " The reason I 'm so rich is because I did n't have time to spend my money . " Another reason Sandfort 's life is so rich might be that she 's spent so much of her money on others . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : James Chatman pays tribute to a favorite uncle by funding the mentoring of Northern Virginia boys . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Catherine Muther ( left ) started the Three Guineas Fund to help girls gain confidence . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Business executive John Abele 's contributions fund a magazine for high school historians . <p> By Thom Geier <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
