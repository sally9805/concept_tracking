It 's not just ourselves , but everything that we may not see as others do .... <p> <p> One Folobolos of Bodo saw a new godbeing . The new god-being emerged from its great white private temple to stand on the stony hard ground that surrounded the Temple of the Swinbrok . Folobolos knew that it was a god-being . The white temple it had traveled in was radiating the divine yumm-yumm energy . The patterns were new in Folobolos " receivers , and powerful . Folobolos wanted to be closer . He slither-crept along the edge of the Dry Place of Swinbrok , half in the water so that he could sink out of sight if he must . The god-being was golden and glorious . It glittered in the sunlight of that sacred ground . Folobolos crept closer still , slick with fear and excitement , until he trembled with the closeness of it . The divine yumm-yumm energy rang through him entirely . The golden god-being stood beside the curved , white wall of its temple , in rapport with that and thus unaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surged up from the water , balancing the leap with his outflung tail , and he snatched up the godbeing . He clasped it to his breast with all his love-tentacles and both pair of hands . The god-being made the ritual gesture of attempting escape , signaling to Folobolos its desire to be captured and held and absorbed . Folobolos " joy buzzed through his flesh . He pressed the golden being close to his breast until its ritual struggles ceased and it fell limp , surrendering its blessing to him . He escaped from the Dry- Place with the godbeing held tenderly in his love-tentacles . He swished directly through the marsh edgings and into the sacred waterways that would lead him to his own temple and his secret altar there . He knew he had done what the god-being wanted , because the divine yumm-yumm pursued him through the marsh and the waterways . Even though fainter , the magical newness of the signal buzzed in his brain and his flesh , tickling every thrillnerve in his spine out to the very tip of his tail . Inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed the golden god-being on the woven-bone cradle of the altar . Each bone of the intricate altar was the bone of an ancestor , and each of these bones , as they cradled the god-being , would sing of the greatness of the greatest child of Bodo , of Folobolos who must be King . He would be King . Folobolos was certain of it now . All of the People would recognize his power , because he had captured this golden god-being . They would choose the best women for him , but he would choose Rhopalura , and only Rhopalura , no matter whom they offered him . The People would learn that Rhopalura belonged to him and to him alone . Folobolos settled back on his tail , and he watched his captive god , lying on his altar . He dreamed of the joy he would feel as he smashed and ate the eggs Rhopalura had been forced to produce for Fascinola , who was King now but who would not be King for long . The god-being did not stir , although the divine yumm-yumm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many antennae . Folobolos did not worry . He had as much patience as a god-being . Had he not captured one ? He would wait until the god-being was ready to speak , until the god-being announced to the People that Folobolos was King over all . Two As Wozurns go , Lord Rokhmyr , known now only as " Rokey , " was on the small side , standing a mere six feet tall in his bare toes , weighing in at only five hundred pounds , most of which , of course , was his glorious coat of fur . The Wozurn pelt , pride of the race , had a range of colors . Rokey 's fur was black , with lighter smudges on his face and hands . He was perfectly groomed and combed . Wozurns are always perfectly groomed and combed . His fine , broad shoulders and powerful arms gave him a rough outline , but the sensitive lines of his sculpted mouth and copper-colored eyes were noble and showed a gentle spirit . He was calm and patient , as men of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience of understanding . Rokey was very well educated . He could take a man 's head off if it needed doing , but he would talk to the man first-explain his options to him . By the looks of the man who had brought the Wozum and his partner so far across space to solve a problem , Rokey might have to do a lot of explaining . This ancient cowboy had a stubborn kind of patience of his own . " Lord Rokhmyr , make yourself comfortable , " Sam Swinbrok said . Sam Swinbrok owned Bodo , owned a whole world . " I 'd be much more comfortable without the title , " Rokey said as he sat down on the oversized couch to which the man had directed him . " You never know who might be listening . " " I assure you , Lord-that is-Rokey , that our privacy here is complete , " Sam Swinbrok said . " I pay a lot of money to be sure of that . We have as much need for obscurity as you do . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve our little problem . Discretion . You can not afford to have your expertise in this matter advertised , and we ca n't afford to have our little problem advertised . " " I 'm pleased to hear that a native uprising is only a little problem . " Swinbrok 's grin was quick , nervous , incomplete . " With your help , this uprising , as you call it , will be just a minor disturbance . " Rokey smelled the kind of fear-sweat that went with big problems that did not go away . The leathery , aging Terran was afraid , not trembling , heart-pounding afraid , but steadily , helplessly afraid-afraid all the way to his core . He was not afraid of the natives , not afraid of dying , he was afraid of something so unknown and different that his bones were weakening inside of him . Rokey could smell all this on him , with a Wozurn nose keener than the wildest wolf , but he said nothing , waiting while the old man settled himself in his own chair . Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the hat , chaps , spurs , and silver fittings could be squeezed into a skinsuit , which meant the man did not go out on the planet 's surface to work like a cowboy . Rokey did not assume , however , that the pearl-handled six-shooter was only for show . Men like Swinbrok really did try to act like cowboys . Swinbrok rubbed his palms nervously as he leaned forward , resting his elbows on his thigh . " Do you like dinosaurs , Lord-uh , Rokey ? " " Everyone likes dinosaurs . " Swinbrok reached up and resettled his black cowboy hat so that more of his weathered face showed . The light from the picture window made a dense relief map of the lines in his ancient face . " My family has been exporting dinosaur products from this ranch for seven generations . I do n't want my grandson to be the last . " " There are other planets with excess dinosaurs . " Swinbrok nodded slowly . His black eyes were intense , hiding that awful fear . " But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet , and I aim to keep it . " " I thought the natives owned Bodo , " Rokey said casually . " They evolved here , after all . " Swinbrok nodded again . " But they would n't have anything without us . The glaciers have everything but this single continent locked up and the natives ca n't compete with the dinosaurs here without our help . So we kind of mutually own the place with them . " Rokey thought that was probably a rationalization of the real situation . He kept that thought to himself . " My expertise , as you call it , " he said instead , " is not in the line of dinosaurs . Mr. Humphrees may have exaggerated my usefulness to you . " It would be just like George Humphrees to do that . Swinbrok licked his upper lip quickly . I do n't think so . You 're the best expert on movies in all civilization , and I need an expert on movies . " " That is me , " Rokey said evenly . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious . Rokey folded his big arms across his chest . " But I do n't get it . " Swinbrok made that nervous gesture of resettling his hat . Rokey could smell the rise in tension . You see , these natives , they 're radio people . I mean , they 've got radio-biology , natural radio receivers . " He paused , uneasy with his choice of words . Rokey 's blunt-tipped ears swiveled forward , but he had heard correctly . " Radio-biology ? " he asked . " They hunt with electrical signals , with biological EM-band receivers , all the way up to the radio range . " Sam Swinbrok had big hands , long hands with once-powerful fingers . Now , his knuckles were twisted and the skin was transparent , thin white paper over old bones . His hands fluttered , as though he could no longer hold on to the reins of his world . " I 'm not used to explaining this , Rokey , " he said finally . " We have our own words for all this , corral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really know how it works , or why the natives like the broadcasts so much . We 've never been allowed to dissect one and find out . We 've used radio to talk to them since the first Swinbrok got here , over two hundred years ago . We do n't know how they convert our signals to information , but they can , they enjoy it , and it 's worked for seven generations . " " Do they broadcast as well ? " Rokey asked . Swinbrok shook his head . " Only by touch . That 's why they work for us . They think we 're special , " cause we can broadcast without touch , like lightning storms , and electrical trees . " Rokey sighed slowly . " I see . " " We 've been paying them for the dino eggs with radio broadcasts . All they want is entertainment . For five generations , all they wanted was music , but fifty years ago they started picking up the video signal from outbranch monitors . After that , they wanted video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed real happy with the stuff we showed them , but things suddenly exploded . They 've gone to war with each other . I 've lost a half dozen hands , my four best women among them . " He sighed . " I ca n't let it get bigger . " Rokey hated to admit it , but Swinbrok had him . Rokey was an expert on " movies . " He was a most educated expert on Hollywood mythology . The fact that he was currently in exile , hiding out as first mate on a private starshipfreighter , was a mere technicality . As " Lord Rokhmyr " of Wozur , he had been head of the greatest university in all interstellar civilization . He had taught generations in the subtleties of Hollywood . Now he only watched movies in his starship quarters , and only occasionally tried to explain things to his young partner , Raymond Harris . Rokey was suddenly eager for a new audience . " How is payment worked out ? " he said . " We broadcast " round the clock during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range is limited . Anyone bringing eggs in is allowed to sit close to the broadcast tower . They had parties there , brought the kids to listen . Used to be that was enough . " " Where do things stand at this moment ? " Swinbrok sat gazing out to the mist that swirled around the Ranch dome . " We 've just started collecting the first batch of walker eggs . Collection varies by a day or two every season , depending on the humidity , but the first broadcasts started a couple of days ago . You got here just in time . " " Maybe , " Rokey said thoughtfully . " Maybe . " " I 've laid in a weapons supply , " Swinbrok said quietly , as though , despite his promise of privacy , someone might hear " Projectile guns , since neural stunguns just make them horny . I do n't want to go that way , except to keep my people alive . If we start shooting-well , seven generations of good relations ca n't be won back in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at that pearl-handled gun , realized again that it really was a six-shooter . Cowboys . He wondered what the real problem was-the obvious , overlooked something that was the root cause . But that was why he had been hired , to find that out . Sometimes only an expert can see the obvious . " Who knows the most about the natives , about the Bodoites themselves ? " Swinbrok looked embarrassed , and shifted his hat again . " That 'd be my wife , Dr. Bailey . She came here originally to study the Bodoites , as a graduate student in exobiology . She 's the expert in the family . She 's the one who got Bolinop to agree to talk with you . " Bolinop ? " " He 's the native big-man . Well , I guess you 'd call him their chief scientist , or shaman . Their society is complicated and primitive at the same time . " Rokey recognized the pattern of titles at once . " Bolinop . " " He 's arranged to get together with you at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were apologizing . " Can you manage that ? " " Why midnight ? " " Bolinop insists . He 's got a thing about keeping his business secret from his people . Gives more mana to the stuff he does . " Rokey chuckled . " And makes his magic tricks look like real magic . " Swinbrok agreed . " He 's got the most powerful mana of his people . " " Midnight it is , then , I would n't want to offend his mana . " Rokey tried to sit up straighter in the overly comfortable couch-cushions . " Meanwhile , I should talk to your wife . " " Yes . " Some sad shadow brushed Swinbrok 's face , half-hidden by the tilt of his hat brim . " She 's down at the labs . I guess she is , anyway . You ask my son , Daniel . I 'll send him up . He 'll know where she is just now . " Rokey made no comment , but he saw how the pale window light outlined the old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside his gaudy cowboy costume . " I 'll send Daniel up right away , Lorduh , Rokey . He can tell you more . I just wanted-well , I needed to know you were willing to help us . " " I 'll do the best I can . " Even if only to satisfy his own curiosity . Swinbrok stood up , pushing himself out of his chair with his big , tired hands . " Daniel will be up here in a minute . Shall I have him bring you some coffee , or a drink ? " " One of each , " Rokey said pleasantly . " Mixed any way you like . " Swinbrok smiled . " Dan , he 'll do you up fine , sir . Fine , indeed . " He stood gracelessly , and Rokey understood how old a man he was , ancient , shriveled , held together with string and spit and stubbornness . The cracks across his face were the glazing of centuries , and his cowboy duds hung upon him like a loose skin . Rokey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be older still , but he respected age . Swinbrok and Rokey were actually of similar age in Sun-years , but Rokey had been born under a different Sun . He was still in the first quarter of his life span . Swinbrok was not . He was old , measuring the life left to him in months and weeks . Rokey thought about that while he watched the ancient cowboy swagger out with slow-motion pride . Rokey thought about dinosaurs and radio waves and video signals , and about cowboys carefully tending giant eggs in swamp nests . He thought a lot about native Bodoites watching movies in deep jungle theaters . What did they perceive ? What does a living brain make of direct radio signals ? Rokey had just concluded that the only thing he really had to work with was the fact that they did enjoy the signals , whatever they made of them , when Swinbrok 's son , Daniel , interrupted this mental exploration . " Good evening , sir . " Daniel was a sad , thin ghost of his ancient father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , not tail , not short , not smiling , sad , or serious ; smooth of face and manner , smooth of voice , gliding over the terra-cotta tiles with a sinuous , smooth motion . He was not dressed like a cowboy , although his finely tailored black suit was of denim . He set a tray down on the end table beside Rokey as he introduced himself , welcoming Rokey to their " little family problem . " " Your father called it a minor disturbance . " " It is a disturbing problem , sir , " Daniel said smoothly . " Our entire family is disturbed by it one way or another . " He poured and mixed deftly as he spoke , presenting Rokey with a hot and promising mug of wild coffee . " You chose the video selections to broadcast to the Bodoites ? " Rokey was guessing , but there was a smugness to the man that showed he was as frightened as his father . " Yes , sir . " Was that defiance Rokey heard ? It was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were capable of picking out the most subtle resonance . Daniel leaned forward slightly , his thin lips parting just a bit . " I wanted visual impact , strong patterns that delivered coherent progressions of universal symbolism . " He spoke crisply , caressing the syllables . A light touched him , an eagerness. aI selected a series that would give them a solid grounding in the jargon of the media , to enhance their appreciation as they watched over a course of years . I was aware that whole generations of Bodoites would be seeing these . " " That 's a lot of responsibility . A whole race of people . For generations . " Daniel nodded , almost showing teeth in a smile . Rokey realized with a twinge of dismay that this man did not understand the enormity of what he had started . Daniel Swinbrok believed utterly in his own good intentions . Rokey knew that there were few things more dangerous than half-informed good intentions . " Where did you study Hollywood ? " Rokey asked after a moment . Daniel shrugged , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I read . A great deal . I watch a lot of movies . " Rokey wondered more about what Daniel had not read , some of which Rokey himself had written , a long time ago . " What did you show them ? " " Robin Hood . Machicho . The Chilam Balam . Bugs Are Normal . Trideum . Mechanical Horizon . The Wizard of Oz . Drinking in the Atmosphere . Tendaguru . The Chondrite Memorandum . " He had the list memorized . He had been waiting , rehearsed . As Daniel reeled off the other dozen or so titles , Rokey almost approved . He nodded gently as the list went on , but something made him uneasy , something he was missing . " And the most recent ones ? " Rokey recognized that list as well . He did not recognize a pattern that might start a war . " I made certain they saw the very best editions , as well . These people are capable of much nuance in perception . I had to grandstand some to get Father to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend for a better broadcast system , but we owe them that , do n't we ? I mean , if we 're going to be so important to them ? Rokey wished suddenly that his partner , Ray Harris , were here listening instead of doing ship repairs . Ray was of the same race as the Swinbrok family , and he could read humans better than Rokey , and pick up their cues faster . He would know if this Daniel were just fooling himself , sincerely a fool , or merely eccentric . Rokey was a sucker for eccentrics , and trusted Ray 's judgment on that the same way Ray trusted Rokey 's nose . Ray had sharp green eyes that missed little . " Your father suggested I talk to your mother about the Bodoites themselves . " The question hung like bright ice in the air , and Rokey wondered . " She should be down in the lab , " Daniel said , standing up and turning to the tray he had brought in . " I 'll just let her know we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his starship , Yankee Shadow , Rokey slowly shed his skinsuit in the airlock , annoyed by the twist and pull of its plastic surfaces catching at his fur and disarranging it uncomfortably . He hung the suit up in the airlock storage panel , and punched in the commands for the airlock to triple-disinfect it ofany dangerous mold spores picked up while outside crossing from the Ranch dome to his ship . The atmosphere of Bodo was unbreathable and ripe with intrusive life . Rokey was tired , and nearly stumbled over the loose kit bag which Dr. Bailey had given to him . The visit with her had been lengthy , and involved walking through the entire incubation and tanning operations in the warehouse-sized structure Swinbrok had called " the lab . " Dr. Bailey called it her " nursery . " Her devotion to the nestlings in her charge was quite savage . Rokey had been wearied as much by her intensity as the long walk . Rokey was also annoyed that he had not seen his partner , Ray Harris , working on the worn shield elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this meant the work was done , and not that it could not be done , but he knew his partner . It could mean almost anything . He did not want to ask these dino-cowboys for help . He was intrigued by their " little problem , " but he had little confidence in their technique . Ray was not in his quarters nor in the galley . Rokey mixed himself a mug of liquid supper , needing nutrition , not food . He wondered why he could not smell anything like Ray . His nose usually told him where his partner was and most of what he was doing . Rokey 's thinking was grounded in scent . His thoughts were often in smells rather than words , colors , or images . He was often immersed in only smell memories , smell thoughts , whole afternoons spent in wordless contemplation . Smell was a color in his mind , a world of smell-colors blended on a palette of memory , incomprehensible to image-thinking yet clear in his mind . Rokey drained the mug without waiting to heat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge , not in engineering . Rokey even checked in sickbay , even though he was certain Ray would not be there . Ray hated the automated hospital unit so fiercely that only dire blood loss would have forced him into it . Rokey would have smelled that instantly . Rokey had known from the moment the airlock opened that Ray was not on board . His nose knew . He had refused to accept the knowledge , and stubbornly paced through the ship . Ray was not on board and neither was the gold-coated skinsuit he had been wearing to go outside the ship . Rokey went up to the bridge , and called up every visual scan the starship had of its own outer hull , all of which showed only the Yankee Shadow 's clean white self glowing dimly in the clouded , watery light of late afternoon . He focused on the hull panel at which Ray had been working . It stood open , with the translucent photonic plates still partially raised out of their bubble-pack housings . Ray was gone . Rokey felt weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , simple explanation . Ray would return any minute . Rokey already knew that this was not true , that his partner had gotten in trouble , bad trouble , somehow . Rokey had to find him . He opened the comlink to the Swinbrok Ranch , and Swinbrok himself answered . He sounded angry , but quickly forced politeness into his voice when Rokey identified himself . " My captain is missing , " Rokey said . " Tall , thin fellow , Terran , blond . Wearing a goldtone skinsuit . " " This is bad territory for a man to wander out alone in , " Swinbrok said in reply , after a long minute . " Especially in gold . We must have forgot to warn you about that . Was he drinking ? " Rokey thought back to watching Ray suit up to go out for this maintenance that had to be done before they could take off again . Ray had been angry , but not drunk . " No . He was working . Outside . " " I 'll send some men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his suit good ? " Rokey frowned at the casual impertinence of ground dwellers . " Yes . " " Good . He 'll need a decent suit here . This place will eat you alive if it can get in a crack . " Find him , " Rokey said quietly . " Of course , Lord . . . of course , Rokey . Ill get the foreman herself on it . " When he had signed off , Rokey noticed that a single monitor indicator was powered on , showing that Ray 's private music broadcaster was playing . He had set it to play work music at him , broadcast to his suit receiver from the dash . The program had just started over , a twohour show . Rokey felt a dangerous surge of excitement and quickly settled back to his controls to cut into the broadcast and talk to Ray . " Cap'n , where the hell are you ? Ray ? Are you out there ? " Rokey 's control systems and monitors could not tell him if Ray 's suit radio was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They could not tell him why Ray was not answering . The static-ripped mists and electrically sizzling plant life produced too much interference for any tracking , Ray 's here-I-am signal would be invisible , even if it were on . Rokey sat on the bridge and fumed at his own helplessness . This planet had more than insidious mold spores and electric shocks . There were dinosaurs out there in the mists , animals that ate things for a living , animals for whom Raymond Harris in a gold-coated skinsuit would be only a brightly packaged snack . Swinbrok 's call came back too quickly . There was no sign of Ray anywhere on the Ranch grounds . " We 'll keep looking , " Swinbrok assured him . " We have n't had any of the big fellas come around this close to the Ranch . We keep tabs on the few that are left . I think we 'd know if anything had gotten him . Can he swim ? " Rokey had to think hard . He could not remember ever seeing Ray close enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not put in much time on planets , doing planet things . He was a starman , a trucker , born and raised in the starlanes of the galaxy . " I 'm sure he could get the hang of it if he had to , " he answered finally . " You sure he was n't drinking ? " Rokey growled back an answer so curtly that Swinbrok , on the other end , began apologizing . " The Bodoites have been acting crazy , just crazy . This is the kind of thing that made me call in the Humphrees Agency for help . Equipment disappearing , crazy . " " I 'll start working on your problem , Swinbrok . You just keep your men looking for my partner . Even if all I get back are his parts , I 'm going to want to count the pieces . " " We 've got Bolinop ready to meet with you , Rokey . Tonight . " Rokey could hear the anxious edge to Swinbrok 's voice . " I 'll be ready , " he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help in the search for Ray . " My men will be along there about seven . " Four Raymond Harris knew there was something wrong before he was even fully conscious . He lay very still as he awakened more . He was , at least , inside his skinsuit . Training from his youth made him check readouts on his faceplate before he looked at anything else . Nothing around him except the readout graphs made sense . He tried to focus on these as he pushed away panic , but all he could determine was that he was still alive , and he needed the readouts to be certain of that . He was completely numb everywhere that did not hurt . All he remembered was a searing jolt of raw electricity sizzling his senses through the gold-coated suit that was supposed to protect him . Was he dead ? Ray heard Rokey 's voice again and realized with a jolt that he had awakened because Rokey was calling him . He tried to reach for his transmitter control , but his arms were so tightly wrapped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that activated his suit radio . " Ray ? Ray , you out there ? " Ray struggled . Rokey 's voice went on in his ear , worried , tired , annoyed . Ray wondered dizzily if he could talk even if he could get his suit transmitter turned on . " I know you 're out there , Ray . Just hang on . We are looking for you . Just stay alive . We 'll find you . " Ray worked on that , holding on to it . Rokey had saved him before . He would do it again , Ray was sure . Five The lake was placid . Rokey regretted the thought at once . He disliked the word " placid . " It reminded him of milk , and he hated milk . The lake waters lay flat and sullen beneath the rotten timbers of the dock , sucking at the moldering wood with soft snickers , sighing at the night wind . Rokey liked that better . The black waters were waiting , poised , plotting . Things half-alive stirred in its fetid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-contained atmosphere of the skinsuit cut Rokey off from the night 's fragrances , denying him contact with a world of smells . The aged , noisome wharf crawled with unseen , unscented , insensible life , yet to Rokey it was distant , like a poorly done documentary . All he could smell was himself and the inside of his suit . Even his copper-foil eyes were unable to see into the darkness here- there were only movements of black against blackness . Thick mats of dead leaves muffled the slap of waves against the dock planks as the Bodoite boat approached . It rode without lights , slicing quietly through the black water . Mist-enshrouded stars glinted on the murky surface , revealing the boat only as ripples among dim reflections . It seemed enormous to Rokey in this darkly unreal place . A pair of dragons rode a wooden log over thick waters , dark shapes on darkness . The dock shook under him as they pulled up alongside . Rokey recognized then the " two-man raft " as described by Swinbrok 's wife . The craft itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glorified log . One Bodoite lay in the front , anchored somehow on the log but with his chest , forelimbs , and head submerged at the prow up to the curved nosetube . His huge bulbous eyes gleamed above the waterline like headlights . He was the navigator , guiding the raft with his radiomagnetic sensing systems in the tentacles , antennae , and forelimbs in the water . His long tail stretched out along the center of the craft , gripped by the lovetentacles of the pilot who stood at the rear . The pilot 's tail dangled down into the water behind , braced by elaborate carvings in the wooden log , serving as a living rudder . His powerful hind legs hung down into the water on either side to paddle the raft along . The two thus sailed together as one , fore and aft , navigator and pilot , linked in complete communication by the contact of love-tentacles to tail sensors , nervous system to nervous system . The size of the boat was determined by this combination of body lengths . No two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refusing to let alarm overtake him . Dr Bailey had assured him that nothing could sink these native-made craft . Rokey tried to believe , but his nerve was shaken when the pilot reached out with his powerful middle-arms and grabbed him . He was hoisted up into the night and laid flat on his back across the narrow raft . Rokey was abruptly disoriented as the pilot spun him around , lashing him like a crate across the deck , holding him in place there only by the tail-and-tentacle grip along the length of the craft . Rokey could make out the pilot towering over him on his right . He was impressed by the size and strength of the Bodoites , and he had to focus on the misty stars overhead to avoid getting seasick . On his dark left , the navigator was only a pair of eyegleams in the night . They pushed off from the dock as smoothly as if dancing . Dense jungle patterns emerged in pale light relief against the misty night sky . Jagged leafshapes leaned at chaotic angles over the craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel , sailing toward the lesser moon . Ragged jungle noises sounded from all sides , giving depth to the darkness . The craft sailed on smoothly , powered by the pilot 's muscular hind limbs , guided through the silver and black night by natural senses far more finely tuned than Rokey 's own . Rokey felt remote and isolated , cushioned and cocooned , yet suspended precariously above dangerous depths . The night was marked out by slow ripples on the raft hull sounding like gentle bell notes . He thought of milk again , with foam like bubbles of mist across the star-studded darkness .... Rokey shook himself awake . The jungle shapes against the night had given way to flats of towering reeds , tall plants with a trillion tiny points of light , static electricity sparking from the bending and twisting of crystalline stalks . The mist crawled with randomly glowing shapes and wisps of phantom light . Rokey tried not to see things in the shadows , but he could see a lot now , things in the night , steady crashes of miniature lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut through , a guttural splitting of air and eardrum that rumbled on and on , reptilian annoyance clear in every resonance . The Bodoites sailed on without a ripple of response . Rokey stifled his own desire to hide under the boat , raising his head slightly to peer at the dark . On the shore , a shadow-shape as big as a building skulked enormously through the sparking reeds , outlined in static lightning . Eyes as big as teapots gleamed red in a black skull scaled and ridged with bone . The Bodoites landed him at a sandy strip of beach skirting a rough pyramid of natural stone that rose out of the whispering marsh high up into the clear night sky . He was set out on the beach with the same simple gesture-the pilot scooped him up and thrust him onto the sand . He nearly fell over , more from astonishment than balance . They pushed off , sailing away silently . The narrow strip of beach was bright , as though the sand were of diamond . The pyramid was black rock and shone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ static at the top , more lightning . Rokey felt this was a most likely spot for a " scientist/shaman . " He changed some vital settings on his skinsuit controls , and began to climb . Bolinop was waiting for him when he had finally pulled himself up to the broad platform at the top . The aged Bodoite was over four meters tall , and seven or eight from nose to tail , although Rokey saw this bulk only as a mass of living darkness crouched before him in the night . There was a structure of woven bone behind Bolinop , a gleaming semi-spiral more immediately visible than the being before it . Bolinop did not move , or respond to Rokey . The old man might be asleep . Rokey debated whether or not to wake him . It was just midnight , but he did not know whether that was early or late for the Bodoite . He stepped carefully across the stone platform toward the alien 's dark bulk . Bolinop , however , was not asleep . His headlight eyes flashed open as Rokey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch the antenna of Rokey 's skinsuit . " Good evening , Lord Rokhmyr . " The Bodoite 's voice in Rokey 's suit radio was slow and thick but precisely spoken . Rokey tried to remember the gist of Dr. Bailey 's long-winded explanation for native communication , but it really boiled down to the fact that they could do it . Bolinop even used the accent and lilt of the Swinbrok family and ranch hands . " It was good of you to travel so far to see me , " Bolinop went on . " I could not come to you . I am too large and old now to climb down from my altar . " There was a strange detachment to the way he declared what amounted to a death sentence . This pyramid towered high above the surrounding swamp , removed from all sources of water or food . Rokey did not have time to understand . " It was important that I come here to talk with you , " he said . He did not know why , yet . He hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a hunch . " If this time of trouble has come because the People wish that the Swinbrok would return to the stars , then it will fall upon me to tell the Swinbrok to go . " " Would you do this to us ? " the aged scientist /shaman sounded anxious , although his dark bulk sat unmoved in the dark . " You would take away our star ? " he asked . " Only if it is the will of your people , " Rokey said . " This is your land , your world . " Rokey was locked into the smell-deprived protection of the skinsuit , and the isolation made the drama , lit by lightning , of unreal proportions . Would " the Swinbrok " humbly accept rejection from the natives of Bodo if Rokey had to report that this had finally happened ? " The Swinbrok comes to us as a gift of heaven . " Bolinop interrupted Rokey 's thoughts . " It is the divine grace by which we live in this strange new land . " " Strange new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " There were not many of the People left when the Swinbrok threw his star temple down into our swamps . The ice walls had taken all our lands , and driven us into this place where we had never been able to live before the ice . Many thousands died in the journey here . The coming of the Swinbrok was the sign we had asked from the heavens . " " This continent is not your homeland ? " " No . The People are from the other side of the world , from a land that was broad and fair , rich in trees of great size and beauty , not like the treacherous swamps here , but the stars of that place had grown angry with us , and they sent the ice to cast us out . We ran away from the walls of ice until we came to this place , where only a single star that we recognized could still be seen hanging low between the trees . I have chosen this spot because I can see that star from here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wonderful thing for your People to have done . " " Yes . These new stars here favored us , because we had traveled so long , through such dangers , to come here . Perhaps these new stars had warred with the stars above our homes , and won us as their prize . Then , one star fell down from the sky to join us . This was the Swinbrok , who came to save us from the walkers and the eaters who feed in this place . The Swinbrok was injured in his fall , and we tended him , made him strong again . In return , he killed the eaters that would have eaten us . Instead we ate them , and we grew strong . We did not have to eat our children to stay alive . So the People became many and filled this land . Now , it is our homeland and we have named the stars to make them ours . The walkers and the eaters are fed to those stars . Now we eat chub birds and squanta , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought the dinosaurs-I mean , the walkers and the eaters , without the Swinbrok ? " Rokey was bothered that the laws of civilization hung on such legal details , but the difference between interference and assistance was written in very fine print . " No . Our People failed in every attempt . They are strong , enormous monsters , and we have no weapons that can hurt them . Our numbers were fewer with each night of stars . The ice walls would have eaten us if we had remained in the homeland . The beasts of this new land were eating us until the Swinbrok came with starfire . Only a god-being from the stars can kill a walker or an eater . Walkers crushed us beneath their feet , and eaters ate us , and sought our eggs , until only a hundred dozen of a dozen were left of the multitudes of the People . Too many of these survivors were men , men without women , who fought to take the eggs of others . The Swinbrok came , and now our eggs and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to absorb the enormity of this simply told story . An entire race , a unique evolution , poised on the brink of extinction between glacial ice and tropical carnivores. zA hundred dozen of a dozen " left out of an entire race , a People . They had been pulled back from that brink by the pure chance of a starship crashing in their midst . They had saved the first Swinbrok , and he and his family had saved their race , and they had grown rich and powerful in their own right as a result . The " stars " bought the eggs of those dangerous dinosaur carnivores , and the only payment the Bodoites asked for was music . A magical balance , a bargain struck between strangers . A precarious balance that was about to tumble and fall unless Rokey could find the tiny lever that would restore their personal mythology of the universe . Such chaotic results of interference had made the government of civilization create laws forbidding contact with races at the level of culture of these Bodoites . But failure to interfere would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinosaurs would have been left to rule Bodo , the walkers and the eaters . " But none of this tells me why you , Lord Rokhmyr , have come here , so far from your own home and the greatness of your own house . " Lord Rokhmyr had been far from his home and the greatness of his own great house , which was considerable indeed , for a long time , but this was one of those few moments when he did not mind . " There is trouble among your People , trouble between them and the Swinbrok , " he radioed to Bolinop . " I have been asked to find what will end this trouble and bring peace and harmony back to the People and the Swinbrok . " " That 's a tall order . I myself am deeply puzzled by it . " " Is this new trouble ? " " If I were able to know this , I could make this desired peace myself , Lord Rokhmyr . I am made helpless by the knowledge of my ignorance . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I do not know is a terrible burden . " Rokey felt he had just made an incredible breakthrough . Once he had figured out what the hell he had broken through to , he might have a chance of figuring out what was driving the Bodoites to riot and might , just possibly might help him to find Ray . " The Swinbrok believes that he is to blame for the changes in your people , " he said . There was a long , lightning-struck moment while Bolinop thought about this . " This is a thing of mysterious proportion , " he said finally . That made sense , but only in a nonsensical way . Rokey waited . " To place it in time , to place the beginnings in time , one must go back four seasons and more . " Bolinop spoke slowly , as though he were thinking out loud , calculating . " Before then , the time of the egg harvest was solemn , even profound . The women danced in the amphitheater for the young men , and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " This has changed ? " Rokey asked . " The women hide , and the children behave unspeakably . The young men who are still building their altars become insane , and attack one another and the nestlings . It is very strange . " " And this all began four seasons ago ? " " I was still able to listen to the divine yumm-yumm in the amphitheater five seasons ago , but that was the last time . Since then , I have been here , closer to heaven . I thought , at first , that I was only envious of those free to dance in the market , but perhaps I do not imagine the madness . " " How does the madness show itself to you ? " " The young men believe they are on a mission from God , and are no longer subject to the laws of the People . They steal the magic tools of the Swinbrok , and attack the women . " " And they do these things instead of collecting the eggs of the walkers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of our ways , the eaters will rise again in numbers . " Rokey had a little trouble referring to the broadcast to the Bodoites as " the divine yumm-yumm , " but that was the jargon on Bodo . " The Swinbrok believes that the broadcast of the divine yummyumm is the source of the trouble . Do you think this , too ? " " It is in the marketplace that the madness begins , " Bolinop replied . " I would not care to believe that the Swinbrok would broadcast madness . That is not the way of the Swinbrok . " " Even the Swinbrok can make mistakes . " " And this is your purpose ? To find error in the ways of the Swinbrok ? " Rokey hesitated . Bolinop had hit the matter square on target , but Rokey was not comfortable with challenging someone else 's divine nature , imagined or otherwise . " It is my job to fight madness . The Swinbrok cares about the People , and it is important that the People are always free to say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , because I have been removed from the marketplace now for four seasons , and have not felt the yumm-yumm . I can not tell you if it inspires this madness . " Rokey was surprised . Neither Swinbrok nor his well-informed wife had known Bolinop had gone into such isolation . Data on the People was sketchier than they wanted to admit . " I can have them broadcast the yumm-yumm here , to you , so that you can measure its value , its flavor . " Bolinop 's voice in his suit receiver was hushed with awe . " You have this power ? " Rokey clicked on his transmitter and changed settings . " Swinbrok ? You listening ? " " Right here , Rokey , " came back promptly in his ear . It was Daniel . " Is there a problem ? " " Maybe not . Can you arrange to have a narrowcast beamed here , to Bolinop 's temple ? He has n't been to the marketplace in four seasons , he says . I want his opinion on the stuff you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only take a few moments to triangulate . " " Use my suit signal as a trace . I 'm standing close enough to him . " " Anything specific you would select ? " " Whatever 's on in the market right now . " Rokey thought Daniel sounded rather cool . Rokey was certain now that Daniel was the problem . He wondered if Daniel suspected himself as well . Rokey 's suit picked up only the audio . The opening credit music was crisp and spare , uninspired . Rokey recognized the movie theme at once , and shrugged . B-grade stuff . A reasonable choice , not one he would have broadcast , but reasonable . Rokey expected Bolinop to say something , but the huge alien 's response to the broadcast was physical , and obvious even in the dark night . The massive shape of tendrils and tail , arms and arms and arms , seemed to swell up against the sky above Rokey , and sizzles of miniature lightning bolts danced around the knobs on the huge head , glowing in the teacup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion , a mountain melting toward him . Rokey 's reflex to pull back and run was caught up in a net of wiry tendrils clutching him all around . He fought against panic , against the urge to struggle in the tendril 's grasp , pressed in by darkness . " Bolinop ? ? " he radioed frantically . " Bolinop ! ! " " Please ! " rushed in over the speaker , " Please ! " It was Bolinop , but the signal quavered , weak and horrified . " Please ! Make it stop ! " Rokey hastily radioed to the Ranch . The movie stopped abruptly , in midsentence . Bolinop collapsed , sagging away from Rokey , releasing him . Rokey staggered backwards , catching himself at the edge of the platform . He was breathless as though he had been running , and astonished at how thoroughly terrified he had been . The old Bodoite huddled away in the dark , crouching down into the emotional shelter of the spiral altar that was woven of the bones of his blessed ancestors . Purple lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorns of light , but his huge eyes were squeezed shut , and he swayed heavily from side to side . " Rokey ? " That was Daniel on the radio , nervous , whispering . " Sir ? Was that all right ? " Rokey swallowed down a few choice Wozurn curses , regretting that the man would not understand the nuance . He made himself take a deep breath and another before replying . Shut up . We 're on to something . " Rokey 's curiosity over Bolinop 's reaction to the signals overwhelmed his residual terror . Has the yumm-yumm ever done this to you before ? " " Nothing has ever been like that before ! That was not the yumm-yumm sent by the divine ! That was the essence of darkness , that was the flavor of the marrow in the Devil 's bones ! " " Bolinop , you have to help now . We 've found the problem . That 's half the solution . " " Yes . Yes , this is urgent . I can not abandon my purpose before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monsters if this is not stopped . " " It was as bad as that ? " " I have no words that will fit into your language to tell you of how bad ! It will change us . " " Then help me with some more experiments , Bolinop . Can you face another broadcast ? " The dark bulk shuddered . Rokey felt it , but Bolinop answered gravely . aI will face it . I have my own honor to defend now . I have lain here in the comfort of my temple and let this happen to my People . I will face anything to undo that . " " What 's your favorite movie ? " Rokey asked . " From before the last season you were in the marketplace ? " " Chilam Balam , " Bolinop answered at once . " No yumm-yumm has bathed my soul in light more sweetly than this . " He sounded wistful , as though the question had raised memories . The Chilam Balam was an ancient fairy tale from the Swinbrok 's homeworld of Terra . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a classic that had stood the test of a thousand years of interstellar audiences . It was appropriate to the Bodoites " enforced exile in the jungle swamps of their world , since it was myth from a jungle culture . Rokey radioed back to Daniel , and told him to narrowcast just the first sixty seconds . Bolinop reared and stiffened as though he had been shot , and then sagged back limply when it stopped . " That , that is not . That was not . " His radio voice was a whisper . " No . " Bolinop interrupted himself . " I did feel some of what I remembered , the magical song of the story was there , but buried , as though seen through swamp bile , as though evil had woven threads through every line . It is difficult to find words . The stench of it ! " Rokey had seen the movie on his own suit screen . That was the Chilam Balam as he remembered it , and a clean edition . " We 'll try again , Bolinop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't think this next one will be so bad . " Rokey called up the Ranch . " Channel my signal into the line that you 've got to my ship . " " Of course , sir . It wo n't take a minute . " Rokey realized that Daniel was in charge of communications , and that was the reason he had done the programming for the Bodoites " " divine yummyumm " broadcast . Another clue clicked into place . Once in radio communion with his own starship , Rokey sent the command signals to the remote unit he had set up to listen for Ray . A few moments of fancy back talk to the shipboard computers gave him access to his own private movie file , a file larger than those owned by some planetary libraries . A few more minutes of crosstalk with his private broadcast system got his copy of the Chilam Balam , with a specifically coded change , beamed directly to Bolinop . Five long minutes went by , and Rokey had some time to worry . When Bolinop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop the broadcast . " Bolinop ? " he called . " I had thought all such magic was gone out of the world , " Bolinop said wonderingly . " Or gone out of me . I sat here , bathing in the thin songs of the sky and listening to the lightning , and I let fade the flavor of the yumm-yumm that the Swinbrok brings us from the stars . How could I have forgotten a magic that is so real ? " " So , that one did n't hurt ? " Rokey said . " But that was the same movie , Bolinop . " Bolinop paused , tasting the two memories , and said , " Yes . I do not know how it is possible , but they are the same and they are not . " " And in that lies all the difference , Bolinop , and maybe our solution . " " But what makes them so different if they are the same ? " Bolinop said . " How can the one be divine , and the other so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rokey said . " It was the song of the Perfect Tree in both . But in the first , a hungry wind moved through the leaves , like an evil mist concealing it . It sounded as it should , but the flavors in it , ugly , as ugly as Devil 's spit , and yet .... " The alien paused , for so long that Rokey almost worried . " Do you know the flavor of fire ? " he asked abruptly . Rokey was surprised by the question . " I know what smoke smells like , all kinds of smoke . " " No , the flavor of fire is not the smell of smoke . These two are not even of the same quality . This version of the Sacred Tree story was as different as the flavor of fire and the flavor of the stars overhead . I had not known a thing could taste like that , change like that . " His shudder made the mountaintop tremble beneath them . " What could cause such a thing ? " Rokey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he snapped into the comlink . " How long ago did you get your new satsystem ? " " Twelve years ago , sir , solar . " " And how many market seasons is that ? " " Just about four , sir , a little more . Why ? " Rokey knew that would be the answer because he had predicted it before calling . He was certain now . " Come and get me , " he growled into the microphone . " I know what to do now . " " Rokey , sir-Bolinop does n't want anyone . . " " Bolinop 's exile is over as of now . " Rokey cut him off sharply . " You ca n't afford to go on without his advice-and he 's wasting away up here . I want something done about that . " " Rokey , sir ! " " Put it on my bill ! " Rokey snarled . " I can be out to you in about twenty minutes , sir . " " Do it . " Rokey decided to play one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need your help . My partner disappeared just after we arrived . I 'm pretty sure his suit can keep him alive out here , but I have to find him soon . " " " This is an important thing to you , " Bolinop said slowly . " I sense this in the color of your words . Describe your partner to me , tell me of the place of his loss , and I will send the young men of my village in search of him . " When Rokey described the gold skinsuit that Ray wore , Bolinop interrupted and began to ask many detailed questions . What flavors of light would the goldtone reflect ? How powerful was the signal being broadcast to his suit receivers , how narrowly was its beam focused ? Rokey was surprised by the precision of the questions , but he was taken completely by surprise when Bolinop calmly told him that this was the explanation of what had happened to Ray . " Your partner has been mistaken for a god-being of golden substance , for a newly-fallen star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an altar somewhere . " Rokey asked if that narrowed down the search or made it worse . " There are many young ones with altars in the wild . The madness has affected them all but not all have territory on that side of the Swinbrok Temple . I know of one in particular who would seize a god-being in a golden skin if he found one . " Rokey 's innards did a flip-jump of chemical reaction to the return of hope . " How difficult will it be to find this one ? " " It can he done , even with eyes that do not see the taste of fire . " Rokey called up the connection to his ship , and tied into his movie collection . " While we 're waiting for my ride , Bolinop , would you care to watch the Chilam Balam , the clean version ? " " Thank you , lord Rokhmyr . Do you believe then that you can stop the madness ? " Rokey was very tired , and worry chewed at him relentlessly , the ache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sound positive . " I can stop the madness . " Six Folobolos sat in the entrance to his temple , and opened himself to the divine yumm-yumm which the god-being drew down steadily from heaven , wild patterns of angels dancing over shining pathways , trees that blossomed in darkness , soaring arrays and flavors made visible in his brain , sounds and colors seen behind his eyes . There was nothing here that smelled , or sounded , or buzzed like Bodo . Here was only the alien spicy otherness of star songs . This tangible reality of the stars was the guide and focus of his existence now . Another star had fallen onto Bodo , another god-being had been found , but this time Folobolos held the golden being on his own , private altar . As final proof of the rightness of what he had done , the wild imagery of the divine yumm-yumm regularly became the simple message , " Relax , son , I will find you . I have n't given up . " Seven Ray Harris struggled to extract himself from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not get far . The numbness in his hands and feet was alarming . He could not move and could not feel enough to know why . At least , he did know that Rokey was looking for him . Ray was sure of that because Rokey kept interrupting the music broadcast to say he was coming for him . Rokey also kept changing the music tapes . Ray was sure he would have gone completely wild if he had had to listen to that same tape one more time . That same tape that had been his favorite just hours before . Ray struggled to move his shoulders or his hips , tried to separate some part of himself from this bone straitjacket , but he was painfully locked in . He could lift his head , but only enough to see the monster who stood guard over him-a bulbous mass of tentacles and ropy arms , with eyes too big and too bright , with some kind of sizzling glow to the knobs atop its lumpy head . It stood poised against a misty night sky in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverent . Ray lowered his head , stopped his struggles , and lay back to listen to the music . Rokey was running through his file of favorites . Ray prayed he would only have to hear them all once . " I 've got it figured out , Ray . " Rokey 's voice broke into the music . Ray woke up enough to wonder why Rokey sounded so tired . The message repeated , and Ray was completely , painfully awake . " We 're in a flitter on our way , maybe half an hour away . Stay alive . " " Sure . Easy . " Ray could not reach the receiver toggle . He could not reach much of himself at all . His skin.suit assured him he was alive , but he was tightly clamped inside it . The reverent dragon still prayed against a flashing sky . Ray put his head back and tried to focus on the music . Eight Folobolos saw the glowing orange lights floating toward him in the mist above the swamp , and his many pumps swished inside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reared up , stretching his love tentacles out to the approaching glow . The divine yumm-yumm evaporated and was gone . Instead he was struck by the cold gray flavors and texture of the Swinbrok 's holy signal . These touched his raging brain with a cool , familiar taste . Folobolos sat back on his tail and drew in . The lights floated up closer , resolving out of the mist , and turned into the private flying altar of the Swinbrok . " Folobolos ? Is that you ? the Swinbrok said . The brush of the divine presence was ten thousand soothing fingertips on Folobolos " fevered brow . His moment had come . He put his longest , finest love tentacle out to the flying altar 's antenna . " Swinbrok , it is I , Folobolos . " " Have you been enjoying the music , Folobolos ? " Folobolos could not fathom why the Swinbrok had come here , through the mist and swamp , to ask him this face to face . Was this some terrible test he had not foreseen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell back on the answer that was often safest to questions : " Thank you . " " You know there is always a price for the music , do you not ? " The Swinbrok spoke to him with a perfume in Folobolos " brain that tasted of infinitely small black dots gathered on an infinite , white plain . " Yes . " Folobolos knew . He had not forgotten , but he trembled . " What does Folobolos have to give in return for the music ? " Folobolos knew that his immortal soul hung now in the balance . He had bridged the dimensions . He had brought the Swinbrok Himself out of the Holy of Holies , brought His sacred presence to the altar which Folobolos alone had wrenched up from the swamps . The People would have to see now that Folobolos must be king ! What , what in the name of heaven , could he trade to heaven for this moment ? I have the fire of heaven , Swinbrok , Folobolos beamed to the antenna , answering without knowing the source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven required in return for kingship . " I have the body of the fallen star . I can give you a god-being . " Carbon-black fireworks , droplets of mist , colorless harmonics washed over Folobolos as the Swinbrok spoke to him . " This is a fine trade from Folobolos . This is so fine a trade that Folobolos will be welcome all season at the amphitheater as the personal guest of the Swinbrok . " Folobolos knew his strength when he felt it , knew when his strike would hit true . " May I bring a guest , Swinbrok ? " he asked cagily . Swinbrok 's reply , " Yes , you may bring a guest " was so thrilling that Folobolos trembled all the while that he tore the altar-weavings away from the golden being . He felt his skin change colors , cold to warm , to hot , to chillingly dark . He clutched the god 's golden flesh to his own , touching it for a final communion , and then lifted the glowing form up to the Swinbrok 's altar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the edge of Folobolos " temple . Sparks flew all around in purple flashes of divine eminence . One of Swinbrok 's servants , thick , and bulky and black in the electric light , sprang out of the altar and took the limp form of the golden god into its charcoal arms . The Swinbrok showered Folobolos with a symphony of cloud-colored river swirls glowing with dark light , midnight colors flowing through Folobolos with a haunting and familiar ache . Folobolos was swept away , triumphant . Rhopalura would be his guest at a concert given just for him . He could taste the kingship in his teeth , could feel Rhopalura writhing in his claws . When Folobolos awoke from this contemplation , the lightning-bright sky was silent , and only the rumble of eaters cut through the misty dark . Nine " Yes , " Rokey repeated calmly to Sam Swinbrok . " I blew up your broadcast satellites . In fact , I blew up your entire satsystem . " Rokey tried not to let it show in his voice how satisfying it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house phones . " The fragile old man was translucent with rage , sweating with confusion . " Those satellite broadcasters were brand-damned-new , and I paid a skinful more for them than you 're worth ! " Swinbrok glared at Rokey . " You were supposed to help us , not demolish us ! " " Your insurance can be made to cover , " Rokey said wearily . He felt gray and utterly drained . " You can pick up the replacements you need in any junkyard . You have to have cheap , the cheapest money can buy . " " Damn you ! " The ancient Swinbrok was leaning on his son 's arm as though supported by his own shadow . " And you call yourself an expert ! " " You did n't need a movie expert , " Rokey said , summoning lost patience . " But sometimes it takes an expert to see the obvious . Your problem was your own ignorance of the people who work for you . I simply solved your little problem for you all at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in . Our hospital unit can put his hands and feet back together , but it was too damn close . I had to think of him first . " " Of course , you did , " Daniel said softly , firmly . " Satellites are only property . " " You had to replace them anyway , " Rokey went on , more loudly . " Do n't ever again use anything that broadcasts in color . Color signals are perceived as pure psychosis by the Bodoites , and your new system of satellites all had automated color controls .... " Rokey was almost shouting now . He could n't help it . " I could n't change the video to simple black-andwhite , so I blew them all up ! "
