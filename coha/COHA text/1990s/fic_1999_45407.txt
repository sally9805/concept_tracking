From the start-which is to say before night fell , before he walked like an old man , before he got involved in a Class A Felony , before he lost hope-he could see the exit . It hove in plain sight perhaps two blocks away , though in Central Park distance was measured not in blocks but in strides , as time was measured not in hours but in the slant of sunlight through the leaves . This afternoon 's walk in the park had marked his first departure in months from the path of **37;535;TOOLONG , from a range of possibilities written in steel rail . Today he had wandered from place to place like a boy exploring the rooms of a castle , from paths with the herbal smell of daisies to meadows with the spicy scent of cut grass to misty glades where the air was heavy , old , still , like that in a cedar closet , and where branches divided by shafts of shadow leaftinted green sunlight that picked out fallen leaves like flecks of gold glitter ; today he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field as an offering to John Lennon , had been run into by a bald black boy who was trying to stomp pigeons , had watched from the lawn behind the Metropolitan Museum 's Temple of Dendur as a young woman holding hands with a gray-haired businessman clamped her eyes shut and tossed into the Temple 's reflecting pool coin after coin after coin : today he had awakened to the city as a natural phenomenon , to the place he had in it , to the infinite possibilities in it , which , being infinite , included meeting a woman in Central Park , a woman who-the possibilities being infinite-was beautiful , fell in bed with him , fell in love with him . . . Now he could see the exit , and should he have been allowed to proceed at his own pace , would have reached it in no more than three minutes . <p> " Excuse me , sir , " said a voice from behind him . He turned to it . The woman who called him sir was twice his age . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if drawn with a felttipped marker . Not all the hair pinned up on her large broad head had gone gray , and not all of it had stayed pinned up . Her rayon crepe floral print dress was enormous , and fit . The closely spaced buttons running from neckline to waist were misbuttoned below her bosom . She wore no jewelry , and her only makeup was two quick smears of liver-colored lipstick . She had no purse , but carried a rough brown Bloomingdale 's sack that said big brown bag and a heavy curvehandled wooden cane that was raised straight up into the air like an enormous index finger . <p> " Do you know if that 's the 86th Street exit ? " she asked . <p> " I have no idea . " <p> " Well it is ! " The woman let the scuffed rubber tip of her cane bounce to the ground . " I 've only taken it a thousand times at least . " <p> " Then you 'd better do it again , " he said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound so easy . " There issued from her a sigh that was more than a sigh , more than a wheeze , more even than a moan , but less than a wail ; it was a wail that mumbled , mumbled not because it did n't want to be heard , but because it wanted to be heard not wanting to be heard . " Just a little thing like walking is very difficult for me . " She raised her voice . " Very difficult , I assure you . " <p> The sun was going down ; she was a handicapped old woman : his response was compulsory . " May I walk you out of the park ? " <p> " Oh , would you ? " she gushed instantly , her voice crammed full of false surprise , as though she 'd been forced to wait too long for his offer . <p> Oh , would you ? he mimicked to himself in a Polly-wants-a-cracker falsetto . <p> A wind swept : toward him ; he could hear it , and watching the oak trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved high up the bare old trunks , he could see it too . The wind came then with a cool rush , its sound distant because the trunks were upraised arms that held the rattling leaves high above in bony fingers , and distant , too , because it was a sound he had n't heard in years , a sound associated with far places , not city places , certainly not New York City places ; the wind came then , and swept him back to the past . He lay in his bedroom half-dreaming of his brilliant future and listening to the dry soft clatter of eucalyptus leaves outside his window , like muted applause . The breeze filled out the gauzy curtains , put form behind them , and he smelled the memory of a smell that had never been much stronger than the memory of a smell : the tangy acidic resinpowder scent of eucalyptus coming across the edges of his nostrils , then gone , then come again , then gone . <p> A moan-sigh-wheeze-wail dispelled his reverie . " I 'm scheduled for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's very painful . Very painful , I assure you . " She let out another muffled wail . <p> " It ca n't be any worse than this . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " he said . <p> " What do you have to be so sorry about ? " she snapped . " You had nothing to do with it . " And shaking her head , trailing off , " absolutely nothing to do with it . . " <p> Rotten old hump , he said to himself , entertaining fleeting thoughts of escape . No , he could not abandon an old woman in the gathering darkness , two blocks from the exit . After all , it had been his idea to walk her there , and to tell her he would do it . <p> But " walking " implied going forward , and now he knew that it was indeed possible , as Poe had written , to move as slowly as the minute hand on a clock . He felt as if he were working not against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort one must exert in a nightmare . The old black streetlights along the main road had come on , though their dirty silver glow lit up nothing at this hour . The woman had now begun sighing with every exhalation , which meant with every step , for though she did not breathe rapidly , she took a step no more often than she drew breath . Even at this pace he could feel her pulling and stalling , balking like a horse that did not wish to be led . She would not be satisfied until he picked her up bodily and carried her . <p> " Why on earth would I come to the park so late ? " the woman asked the air around her . " Why ever would I do that ? " Then a little louder : " There has to be a very good reason . " She turned her head to him and spoke still louder , her pitch falling heavily , weighing out each syllable : " There is . There is a reason . " <p> He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to the farthest place he knew , which was Port-of-Spain , Trinidad . He was holding a large yellow-green coconut in his hands and drinking the milk through a straw . Though here coconuts were called " ice colds , " this ice cold was as warm as the early summer air that conducted scents to his nose : the fatty sweet smell of the coconut itself , curried goat meat from the Hot Tasty Roti truck , toffee peanuts from Sidney the Nut Man . Down the street someone was playing Marley and the Wailers , and nobody had any place he had to be . <p> The woman 's voice was a poke in the ribs : " Would you like to know why ? " <p> " Pardon me . . . ? " he said vaguely . <p> " Certainly , " she said , as if granting an actual request for pardon . <p> " Would you like to know why a woman of my age and infirmity would venture all alone into Central Park at twilight ? " <p> " Tell me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently would not pass in any other way . <p> She tugged his shirt sleeve until they were at a standstill , then pulled his ear down to her mouth . Her whisper was hot , sharp with hunger : " To escape from those who would misunderstand me ! " <p> But to misunderstand you , he said to himself , is to understand you well . " And who might that be ? " <p> " The police ! " she hissed , halving the word into two syllables and dragging out the second . <p> " The police , " he repeated dully . <p> She brought her head up , then down into its great nest of jowls . " And would you like to know why I 'm carrying this bag ? " She held up her sack and gave it a rattle . <p> " You went shopping at Bloomingdale 's ? " he said . <p> " Yes I did . Three summer sales ago . And I bought a Versace scarf that was marked down to twenty-eight dollars and seventy-five cents . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tinfoil-andwax-paper drawer . I never took it out until today . " She moved so close and spoke with such emphasis that her breath rippled the light summer fabric of his shirt . " Do you want to know why ? Do you want to know what 's in this bag ? " <p> " No , that 's all right . " He stepped back . <p> " Go ahead , " she urged . " Look in the bag . " <p> " No thank you , " he said firmly . <p> " You do n't have to shout ! " she said , then mumbled , " . . first he screams at me , then he asks why the police would misunderstand . . . " She yanked on his arm . " Well are you coming or not ? We do n't have all night . " <p> He took a deep breath , as he often did when angry , and his lungs filled with the first jasmine bloom of the summer . Moving again , however sluggishly , he felt freed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up amid the bower of oak leaves that were , in late twilight , turning from translucent to opaque . <p> " Today when I went downstairs with the trash , " the woman began with an air of beginning , " my neighbor , Mrs. The Late Dr. Emanuel J. Buchenholtz , came out from the mailboxes where she 'd been waiting to tell someone , anyone , her life 's story . Try to get around her and she just steps in your way while changing the subject to the final illness of her late husband , the angel-My Manny . So . At last , when I pushed past her , yelling at the top of my lungs You have a great day now , Mrs. Buchenholtz ! you just have a great day ! and returned to the comfort and security of the apartment where I 've lived for the past thirty-seven years , do you know what I discovered ? " <p> She stopped dead , raised her heavy eyebrows and dropped each word hard : " There was a man on my sofa . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if scrutinizing that man for the first time . " A Puerto Rican , I think ? I did n't see him ' til I was halfway across the room . A man , fast asleep on my overstuffed . <p> " I took my cane " - she raised it backhand over her face- " and I belted him right across the kisser . And I said , Get out of my apartment , young man ! You get out of my apartment , you young bastard ! " ' She brought her cane high with both hands and down , and down , as hard as she could , moving with a speed of which she had earlier seemed incapable . The words came chopping out of her as she flailed the air : " ' You-just-get-the-hell-ut of my apartment ! " ' <p> The man had backed off to the curb-he 'd had to-and stood watching the old woman whip herself into her fury . Alone in the deserted joggers ' lane , she finally expended herself , her big chest heaving , the cane held loose-handed across her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bead of sweat rolled across her collarbone , collecting fellows along the way , and disappeared , viscous and fattened , into her cleavage . <p> " Now look in the bag , " she commanded . <p> The Bloomingdale 's bag sat innocuously at her feet . He walked toward it , bent down , pulled open the twine handles . In it lay a .38 Special revolver and a battered brown wallet on a cushion of white tissue paper that billowed up around the edges . <p> " Do n't touch it ! " she spat . " You want to leave fingerprints ? What 's the matter with you ? " <p> " What happened to the man in your apartment ? " he asked . <p> " It was a terrible mess . " She shook her head . " I had to put on a whole new outfit . Thank God for slipcovers is all I can say . It 's not the first time they 've saved my life . " She put both hands on the crook of her cane and leaned unsteadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good . I have to sit down . " <p> Leaving the bag on the road , she hauled herself to the narrow path that led to the exit , and sank down so heavily on a park bench that it creaked . " This is very stressful for me , " she said . " Very stressful , I assure you . " <p> Placing the Bloomingdale 's bag at her feet , he sat down beside her . " What were you going to do ? " <p> " Just a minute . " She held up a hand . " I 'm having palpitations . " She lay the cane across her knees and slapped her chest lightly . Her bosom reverberated . " There . There . What was I going to do ? I was going to empty those disgusting things into the reservoir . But it got dark . " <p> " Yes , " he said . He was staring at the bag . <p> " Look-we 're just a few steps from the exit . How did that happen ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break in a hedge and opened on 86th Street . The row of streetlights leading to the exit were dark , as if the park admitted of no clear way out . The traffic light changed , and cars turned from 86th onto Central Park West with a rushing sound like a stiff breeze . <p> For a moment he could smell the exhaust . He was in a car , a station wagon , lying in the back , watching the telephone wires dip and swoop in the sky , then lift taut at each telephone pole , like disordered measures of sheet music . Another smell mixed in , that of perspiration . It came from the old woman . <p> He had to get away from her , to get her away from him . " I 'll do something about the bag tonight , " he said . " You go home . " <p> " Oh , would you do that for me ? " she said . " That 's so nice of you . " <p> " You go home , " he repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you my address , " she said . " Maybe you can help with- " <p> " No-that 's all right . " He held up a hand . She caned the ground toward her and pulled herself up with a luxurious sigh . She shrugged , arranging the shoulder pads inside her dress , and sang out as if calling him to dinner : " I 'm listed ! " <p> " Do n't tell me your name ! " he begged . <p> " Simpson ! " she cried simultaneously . " Initial S. There 's six in the directory . I 'm the one on 8Ist . " <p> She went off , swaying slightly with each short slow step . For a while her bulk blocked the exit from his sight ; then she went through the gap in the hedge and was gone . <p> The cars came again , their headlights flickering across the path at his feet and illuminating the Bloomingdale 's bag . Then the bag and the path went dark . High above his head , the oak leaves clattered . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
