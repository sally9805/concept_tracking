<p> Poor kids paying charter school tuition ? Excuse me <p> Did I read correctly ? In " Romer 's vision abloom " ( Jan. 4 ) , did the governor actually suggest that charter schools be allowed to charge tuition to parents who can afford it to help " pay the freight for someone who ca n't " ? <p> Just who would these parents be ? Those with too little income to afford to send their children to a private school but who somehow have enough income to pay both school taxes and tuition to a public school ? This could be the most arrogant concept the good governor has yet proposed . <p> As a former school board member who worked many long hours in the early ' 80s in an unsuccessful attempt to wrest control of the public schools from the teachers union and give them back to the taxpayers , I know firsthand how far public schools have strayed from their mission . <p> Teachers ' salaries , employee benefit packages and working conditions have now become the central issues surrounding public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populace in the most efficient , cost-effective manner possible . <p> If , through charging tuition , the governor is proposing that charter schools become quasi-private schools , surely there is no need to maintain the charade any longer . <p> It is time for the legislature to do what it should have done in the first place - approve a voucher plan so that parents who are asked to pay tuition know that it is being used to enrich their child 's learning experience in a private school and not being used to prop up a public system that has long since ceased to have education as its principal priority . <p> RUTH WADSWORTH <p> Littleton <p> Why is fans ' anger limited to players ? <p> Amazing . Another angry sports fan blames the athletes . I wonder if Scott Ratcliff ( Jan. 5 , Letters to The Post ) would work for someone who told him that his salary would be capped , no matter how well he performed , no matter how much profit he generated for his boss . I wonder if the team owners would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how well their business did . <p> Fans are angry at the athletes for asking for high salaries , but they do n't seem to care that the majority of owners inherited the money to buy their teams in the first place . In some cases , they inherited the team outright . These business people/owners profess to believe in the free enterprise system , except where it might cut into the profits they make with their inherited capital . <p> Scott whined that the " overwhelming majority of fans do not make anywhere near the income players make " It does n't seem to bother him that they probably do n't make anywhere near what the team owners make either . Unlike the owners , few athletes come from extreme wealth situations , and many have backgrounds from middle- and lower-income families . Each athlete had to prove his abilities before being handed any money . There was no cushy inheritance working for the athlete . <p> The bottom line for these owners is that they are in business to make big money , the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the athletes and not with the owners ? <p> HARI WALNER <p> Thornton <p> Public housing should not be luxurious <p> I read with great interest Saturday 's front- page local section coverage of the Denver Housing Authority 's North Lincoln Park Homes public-housing project . Redevelopment of the property will cost taxpayers a whopping $ 16 million , yet the new project will serve only half as many families in the future as it did in the past . <p> Adjusting the cost figure to include land value of 20 percent , the actual total value of the North Lincoln Park redevelopment project will be at least $ 20 million . This works out to $ 97,100 for each of the 206 low-income townhomes - a cost far beyond the basic housing that taxpayers might be asked to provide . The story quotes officials as saying that the " two-story modified Victorian townhomes will rival some of Denver 's best housing " : this is both appalling and absurd . <p> Low-income housing should be safe , plain and utilitarian . Its purpose should be to provide adequate housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , public housing should not be fancy or desirable enough that someone would actually want to live there . In fact , it should be undesirable , so that recipients are encouraged to get off the dole so they could improve their housing situation , rather than to see $ 97,100 public-housing units as a panacea . <p> I was dismayed and disgusted when the story told of the multitude of people who had lived their entire lives at North Lincoln Park . A lifetime on the dole is not the purpose , nor should it be the outcome , of public housing . <p> JIM McBRIDE <p> Denver <p> All this reader wants is a chance to work <p> I am a native Coloradan who is fed up with government lies . Our state and federal governments declare low unemployment . " Anyone who wants a job has one , " they announce . Lies ! I am 47 years old , white and single . Another strike against me is my weight ( 280 pounds ) . I have 15 years of accounting clerk experience . Companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Speaking for older , overweight people everywhere , I want my credentials to be the sole basis for employment ; not age , martial status , race or weight . Employers , overweight people will not run up your insurance costs . Skinny people get sick just as often as we do . Employers , our maturity and experience are priceless commodities for your companies . Employers , please end this type of job discrimination . <p> I will soon be homeless thanks to this discrimination . Our governments offer no help . Employers offer no jobs . All I desire is a chance to work in the field of my experience . I want employers to look beyond my physical stature and see my valuable contribution as your employee . Employers , look at my age as a source of responsibility and dependability . I have 20-plus years of solid work left in me . Please hire the older person . Hire the overweight person . We wo n't disappoint you . <p> DAVID A. KENT <p> Aurora <p> Add chauvinists to your ' pigs ' list <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 : " To honor the Year of the Pig , let 's look at some porkers : California newcomers . We 're tired of the way they hog our highways , clog our ski runs and drive our real estate prices sky high . " <p> Perhaps California newcomers should n't clog your subscription lists , either . You would do well to add regional chauvinists to your list of " pigs . " <p> HEATHER MEEKER , Native Californian <p> Englewood <p> Lesson of ' bitch ' story : <p> give viewers a third option <p> Regarding the Connie Chung " bitch " story : <p> What we are seeing is the continuing degeneration of our mainstream television news media . What ever happened to simply reporting the news ? Why do Dan and Connie have to generate it ? <p> This de-evolution of our news has now blurred the lines between Hard Copy and Dan and Connie . <p> What we viewers need is not the validation of junk news by the networks , but the separation of " regular news " and " tabloid " entertainment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumb of information , but the betrayal of a promise by a " respected " news anchor ultimately was what the story became . <p> We viewers now are stuck with watching Dan and Connie 's prime time flying circus , along with the rest of the prime-time news . Or we have the alternative of turning them off . It would be nice to have three choices . <p> JOE THORBURN <p> Greeley <p> Story of DEA agents <p> leaves reader incredulous <p> I am writing in response to the Jan. 6 article , " Drinking lunch work , agent says . " I have been outraged by the conduct of the DEA agents since I first read about the Sedalia incident months ago . But the story emerging from the agents ' trial testimony is such a contradiction to the citizens ' version that I am incredulous . <p> A four-hour " working lunch " ? Eleven pitchers of beer and two rounds of hard liquor never impaired the judgment of the group ? These men have failed to uphold even minimum standards of conduct , first in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attempting to cover up their actions . They are a disgrace to law enforcement and should all lose their jobs . <p> CANDACE TAYLOR <p> Lakewood <p> Animals were occupants <p> I would probably go into a burning house to rescue two dogs and a cat ( " Animals saved from blaze , " Post Jan. 4 ) , and I certainly would go in to save my beloved Alaskan malamute . I might even be foolish enough to try to rescue a human . But I 'd never be dispassionate enough to call a burning building with live animals in it vacant , as the Denver Fire Department 's Lt. Randy Atkinson was quoted as saying . <p> DORI ARAVIS <p> Fort Collins
