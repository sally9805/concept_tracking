<p> Seven months into the Clinton administration , U.S. Rep. John Linder , a Republican from Georgia 's 4th District , returned home to rub elbows with constituents and talk about issues . <p> Recently , the National Taxpayers Union rated him 12th in Congress on the number of measures he co-sponsored to cut federal spending . He had the most in the Georgia delegation , lending his name to bills that would cut $ 34 billion . <p> A former state representative , businessman and dentist , Mr. Linder has been in Congress for seven months . His district covers east and northeast Atlanta , Rockdale County and portions of Gwinnett , DeKalb and Fulton counties . <p> Last week , he talked with staff writer Lucy Soto about the recent wrangling over the budget and what lies ahead . <p> Q : There has been lots of talk of Congress coming home and explaining to constituents about their votes on President Clinton 's budget bill . What kind of reaction have you received ? <p> A : I just came from a speech in Chamblee where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is overwhelmingly against that bill . I 'm sure glad that I 'm explaining why I voted no instead of why I voted yes . <p> Q : What 's your take on the final outcome ? <p> A : This is a job-killing , tax-raising , economy-slowing tax measure . When you come out of a recession you hope everybody will hire one more employee . When you slam the brakes on it like we are doing with this tax bill , you expect all those businesses to let go of one person . <p> Q : Do you agree with Clinton 's characterization that the budget votes finally broke the gridlock in Congress ? <p> A : There was no gridlock . When the Democrats during George Bush 's term of office brought up minimum wage , increasing taxes , Americans with disabilities , the clean air act , the racial quota act , he signed them all . That was n't gridlock . <p> Q : So why do you think the president says there was gridlock ? <p> A : It 's hard to take a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also has been saying that the Republicans went on strike and did n't participate . But he also does n't tell the American people he locked us out . When he came to Washington , D.C. , in December , he was invited to come meet with Republican congressmen and Republican freshmen . He said " No , thank you . " <p> In January , when they were passing all the closed rules with all the bills that were coming , he , ( Rep. ) Butler Derrick ( D-S.C. ) and the Rules Committee told our people " you 're irrelevant . " We do n't care . We 're going to prove we can rule without Republicans . ' <p> When the Ways and Means Committee marked up the tax bill , they not only closed the press out , they closed out the Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee . It was all in secret . Then they ask us to work for it when we have no role in shaping it . Mr. Clinton was not being forthright when he said we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vacation break and reconvenes next month . What are your plans ? <p> A : I still have more people to see around here . But I am going to go to Israel . It 's an interesting part of the world . It 's a dangerous part of the world - probably close to half or 40 percent of our territory for foreign policy expenditures , foreign aid . I 've been invited to go by the largest congressional contingency that 's ever gone . It 's about 20 of us . <p> Q : When you go back to Congress in September , what are some of the issues you will be dealing with up front ? Obviously health care will be a big ticket ? <p> A : NAFTA North American Free Trade Agreement . I truly believe , after Clinton made all these promises , it came down at the end he promised we would come back in September or October , and we would cut more spending . I do n't think he could get away without doing that . I think we 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My guess is that he 'll try and get the military one more time . And that will be a big battle . <p> But the real issues will be health care and NAFTA . <p> Q : What sense do you have of the health care package ? <p> A : I do n't know . It 's all been done in secret , and not one Republican was invited in to play the act to participate . Hillary Clinton has met with various groups , including some Republican groups , to talk about it . But you walk away from the session feeling like you 've just been schmoozed . <p> Q : Is there anything that the Clinton administration is doing right ? <p> A : Yeah , I think they 've done some things . I supported them on the space station . That 's the last frontier and I think we should be there . There have not been a lot of legislative initiatives . I opposed the motor voter bill , I opposed the family leave bill . They 've increased the ceiling , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But those have been side issues . The focus has been preeminently the tax bill . The debate has been on that . He has successfully , I think , gotten a lot of things off the table . He had too many things on the table originally . He 's gotten a lot of things off the table to focus on one thing at a time and I think that is very good . <p> Q : You 've had several meetings in the 4th District since your election . How 's the response ? <p> A : It 's a good way to stay in touch . You get genuine people in there with real questions . <p> I started with them in February and throughout the course of this tax bill , as it got more and more in focus and people began to understand more and more of what was coming from this package , they got increasingly hostile against Clinton . <p> It will be interesting to see how they go next week because the last couple had people actually say , " Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " Look , this guy deserves a chance . Let 's let him pass his package and see it happen . " <p> We started getting phone calls on our answering machine both here and in Washington about 10 p.m. after Senate Republican Minority Leader Bob Dole spoke after the president gave his speech . I saw Bob last week and we were talking and I said , " Have you gotten your bill from AT &T; yet ? " <p> When the speech was over he gave his phone number . Clinton also gave a phone number . Ten million phone calls hit the lines in D.C. That 's 2.5 percent of the American people . By noon the next day , I had received 300 to 350 phone calls , and they were 8-to-1 against the plan . And that was before conservative radio and television personality Rush Limbaugh went on the air . People were saying he generated all these calls . <p> They were just average citizens . <p> Q : What can Gwinnett County look for when you go back to work next month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> A : I would not be surprised to see an effort to repeal his Clinton 's taxes . I do n't think it will succeed . I would not be surprised to see an effort made to reduce $ 10 billion in spending to satisfy some of those tough votes , those guys who made tough votes . <p> And any time you reduce the size of government , that helps Gwinnett County and DeKalb County and Rockdale County . I 'm fortunate in having a district to represent that does n't say we want this , send us that . And I 've also got a district that 's very highly educated and they also understand that whatever comes out of government comes out of someone else 's pocket . <p> I get very few people come to me asking for more spending . Most people that come see me in Washington are from the 4th District . They 've got businesses . And they typically say , " I do n't want anything from the government . Just stop hurting us. "
