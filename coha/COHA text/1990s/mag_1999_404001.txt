HOW TO DECODE TECHNICAL BIKESPEAK BY GEOFF DRAKE // Today 's array of components can result in a case of acronym anxiety when you 're shopping for a new bike . Fear not-this handy guide to the major component groups will have you talking tech-talk in no time . SHIMANO ROAD COMPONENTS DURA-ACE is the flagship road group for the Big S , found on bikes costing $2,000 or more . Like most Shimano road groups , Dura-Ace includes Dual Control Shimano Total Integration ( STI ) , which combines braking and index shifting in one leveL ( Almost no bike makers use down tube shift levers anymore . ) Dura-Ace also features numerous weight-saving measures , such as titanium parts and a hollow bottom bracket and crankarms . Like most Shimano road brakes , Dura-Ace features a powerful Dual-Pivot design . This is a racing group ; no triple option available . Dura-Ace also offers two dipless pedal models : the new , wide platform SPD-R and the smaller traditional SPD pedal . ULTEGRA is the next step down in Shimano 's road hierarchy . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dura-Ace 's features at a fraction of the cost ( found on bikes costing $1,500 or more ) . Unlike Dura-Ace , Ultegra is available in a knee-saving triple-crankset version . Overall group weight is 342 grams more than Dura-Ace ( no titanium or extra machining of small parts ) . Also includes its own SPD-Rwide platform clipless pedal . 105 was completely revamped this year and appears on bikes starting at about $ 1,000 . The three most prominent changes from ' 97 : a loss of 300 grams ; the inclusion of nine speeds in back ; and great , smoothly contoured lines that look at home on the priciest frames . Also available in a triple  --  crankset version . Photograph SHIMANO 105 // RX 100 is an eight-speed group , the next step down in Shimano 's line . However , it 's largely absent from this year 's bike market ; most companies specified either RSX or 105 . Available in a triple chainring version . RSX gained eight speeds for ' 99 but is otherwise largely unchanged . It 's found on bikes costing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March ) . We expect key features of the higher-end road groups to trickle down to RSX in the near future . Usually specified in a triple  --  chainring version . 300 EX is an entry level road group with seven speeds in back , conventional sidepull brakes and down tube levers . CAMPAGNOLO ROAD COMPONENTS RECORD , a heavily revised , top-shelf road group that we reviewed in March ( page 90 ) , is found on bikes costing about $3,000 . Key improvements include shapely carbon-fiber levers ; lightened , strengthened hubs ; titanium seatpost ; and the addition of a new clipless pedal called the Pro-Fit ( the Record version has a titanium axle ) . As with most Campy groups , Record includes Ergopower combined brake/ shift levers , and nine speeds in back . ( All Ergopower nine-speed levers were lightened and given a softer shifting feel for ' 98 . ) All Campy road groups also include powerful dual pivot brakes . Like Shimano Dura-Ace , its direct competitor Record includes many titanium doo-dads and is the group of choice for a featherweight ( 17-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has breathtaking finish quality . See Counselor 1321 Counselor *131 A Racing Triple crankset , derailleur and bottom bracket is an option for this and other top-line Campy groups . CHORUS is next in Campy 's lineup , and is found on bikes starting at about $2,000 . This is a high-end group with most of the excellent performance found in Record , including Ergopower levers and nine speeds , but at a significant cost savings ( it lacks Record 's extensive use of titanium and carbon fiber ) . Chorus was put on a diet for ' 99-100 grams were shaved from the rear hub alone . It includes its own Pro-Fit clipless pedal ( with steel axle ) , and is compatible with the Racing Triple parts . ATHENA is the next step down the line , and is found on bikes costing about $1,800 . It features improved Ergopower levers , nine speeds in back , and is compatible with the Racing Triple parts . VELOCE and the next group , Mirage , are perhaps the most widely specified Campy groups on ' 99 production bikes . Veloce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ergopower levers ( 66-gram weight savings ) , nine speeds , its own Pro-Fit clipless pedal , and is compatible with the Racing Triple parts . MIRAGE was significantly upgraded with nine speeds for ' 99 , and is found on bikes costing about $1,200 . To accommodate the nine-speed upgrade , it received improved and lightened Ergopower levers , a new rear derailleur , and new rear hub . It has its own triple crankset , rear derailleur , and bottom bracket . Photograph CAMPY RECORD // AVANTI , a heavier entry-level group , is unchanged for ' 99 . It 's found on bikes costing about $ 1,000 . It includes Ergopower , and is offered in a triple  --  chainring version . SHIMANO OFF-ROAD COMPONENTS XTR is Shimano 's no-holes-barred off-road group , found on bikes costing $2,300 or more . For ' 99 , the vaunted XTR group got nine speeds in back and an improved V-Brake . It 's the lightest complete off-road group available , thanks to extensive use of titanium ( hub axle and some cogs ) ; hollow crankarms ; and an oversize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it includes Rapid Fire pushbutton indexed shifters . DEORE XT offers much of the performance of XTR for less money ; it 's found on bikes starting at about $1,400 . It received a complete redesign for ' 99 , adding nine speeds and upgraded shifters and brakes . It does not include XTR 's hollow crankarms or bottom bracket . DEORE LX , found on bikes starting at $1,000 , also received nine-speeds for ' 99 , improved shifters and brakes and a facelift . This is a great , durable group with much of the performance of the higher-end parts at a significant savings . STX-RC is an economical eight-speed group found on bikes costing $600 and up . It offers excellent off-road performance , but is significantly heavier than other groups , due to extensive use of steel parts . OTHER GROUPS from Shimano , in descending order , are Alivio ( eight speeds ) , Acera ( seven speeds ) and Altus ( seven speeds ) . Many manufacturers mix these parts with higher-priced STX-RC to achieve costs savings . Nexave is a wide range triple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three- or seven  --  speed internal ( hub ) gear system for the same category . Photograph SHIMANO XTR // SRAM/GRIP SHIFT COMPONENTS SRAM/GRIP SHIFT makes complete offroad drivetrains and brakes , but is primarily known for its twistgrip shifters . There are two platforms : ESP uses a special shifter and rear derailleur , and includes ( in descending order ) , 9 . OSL , 9. fl , 7.0 , and 5.0 . Another system called D.I.R.T . is compatible with Shimano , and includes parts groups called Plasma , Quarz , Neos , Centera , and MRX Photograph ESP 9.0 SL // <p>
