The known universe , as you might have heard , is going digital . LPs gave way to CDs . Direct satellite is eroding cable . But the TV you watch and the movies you rent are still grainy old analog formats crying out for replacement . <P> Those cries have finally been heard . Last week 's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas marked the long-awaited public debut of the digital video disc , the ( putative ) New Tech Gadget of all New Tech Gadgets . <P> DVD comes with a steamy sales pitch . Imagine a 5-in . CD that holds 20 times more data than a CD-ROM and offers the richest sound you 've ever heard and the lushest images you 've ever seen . Throw in digital TV , the standards for which were approved by the feds last month , and the result just might be the culmination of the consumer electronics industry 's long search for a grand unified theory of home entertainment : one hardy , gleaming box that plays music better than your stereo , video better than your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVD , " says John Briesch , president of the Sony A/V products group , " is a ' wow ' product . " <P> That , however , does n't guarantee it will rake in ' wow ' revenues in this millennium . The flurry of product announcements at CES does indicate that after years of broken promises , DVD is ready to roll . " The good news , " says Briesch , " is that we 're starting a business in 1997 . " The bad news is that the emphasis is on starting . The term DVD encompasses various products , many of which wo n't have reached your local Radio Shack by the time you start planning your Year 2000 party . <P> The meat-and-potatoes product is DVD video , which is meant to send vhs and laser disc the way of all eight-track . Two dozen models of DVD players should reach the market this year at prices ranging from less than $500 to more than $1,000 . All offer DVD 's stunning sound and vision , along with the various bells and whistles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including PG- and R-rated versions of a given movie on one disc , multiple languages , no rewinding , movie-and-game pairings , instant searches and every custom setup and picture adjustment that early adopting cinephiles could possibly get all hot and bothered over . <P> The big question is , How quickly will Hollywood release movie titles for this costly and unproved platform ? About 100 DVD titles  --  including , ominously , zero from home-video-titan Disney  --  should come out this year ( a few highlights : Raging Bull , Twister , Legends of the Fall and Tony Bennett 's mtv Unplugged ) , which is a lot fewer than this new medium needs in the long run but more support than the infant CD industry got in its rookie year , 1983 , when Sony moved a mere 35,000 players . " We think DVD will ramp up more quickly , " says Briesch , who predicts 10 million players sold by decade 's end .
