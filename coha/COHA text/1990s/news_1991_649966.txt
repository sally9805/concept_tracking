##@x <p> The answer is : Managed Competition . What 's the question ? <p> This is not one of Johnny Carson 's jokes . The subject is deadly serious : what to do about the crippled U.S. health care system . A little-known system called managed competition offers the best way out . It can control costs , improve care and guarantee coverage to every American . <p> Congress  --  but not the White House  --  is finally turning its attention to health care reform . At one extreme , conservatives back plans to unleash competition among private insurers by requiring individuals to buy insurance . At the other extreme , many liberals advocate scrapping private insurance and creating a one-size-fits-all Government insurance policy . In the middle are " pay or play " plans , like one proposed by Senate Democrats , which would require employers to provide insurance for workers or else pay into a public plan . <p> Each of these proposals would achieve universal coverage but none is satisfactory . Unfettered competition alone wo n't control soaring insurance premiums or protect the chronically ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quality improvement . And the Democratic pay-or-play plan only waves at the problem of cost control . <p> Under managed competition , individuals would not shop for insurance . Instead they would join a large private group , typically at work , or else be assigned to a public group . A sponsor  --  a large employer or government agency  --  would arrange insurance for everyone in the group , soliciting bids from private insurers and providers . Only basic coverage would be tax-deductible , so enrollees would insist that sponsors keep costs low . <p> Managed competition , advocated by Alain Enthoven of Stanford and others , would be competitive because private insurers would have to offer sponsors high-quality care at attractive prices . The system would be managed because sponsors would contract with health maintenance organizations or other managed-care providers , which can offer quality care at affordable rates . <p> The virtues of managed competition are best appreciated by comparing it with the alternatives . <p> Unfettered Competition . Every citizen would be required to purchase basic coverage from a private carrier . Tax credits  --  refunded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of basic coverage . The idea is to set private insurers loose to compete for business , thereby holding down costs . <p> The problem is that the way people buy health care bears little resemblance to the way they buy running shoes . Patients buy care often under duress and almost always out of ignorance . They are not about to dicker over price or sort out good from bad doctors by trial and error . The fatal flaw in unfettered competition is that it does nothing about the reason costs are soaring : fee-for-service payment . In this system , patients choose their doctors , doctors choose treatments and insurers pay the bill . <p> Because fees are based on services provided , doctors are encouraged to provide lots of them . Patients rarely protest because they typically pay only a fraction of the bill . And insurance carriers are helpless because they do n't choose doctors , and therefore ca n't control their billings . <p> Unfettered competition has another perverse result : discrimination . Insurers rig their policies to attract healthy , low-risk individuals and drop those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why millions of Americans wo n't change jobs ; they fear they 'd become uninsurable . <p> Managed competition would eliminate discriminatory practices by lumping individuals in groups and denying insurance companies the opportunity to pick and choose risks . And by negotiating with a fixed panel of doctors on behalf of a large number of potential patients , sponsors would be powerfully positioned to bargain hard . That would keep quality high , fees low and eliminate unnecessary treatment . <p> Government Insurance . Many people look to Canada as a model . Canadians choose their doctors and the Government picks up the bill . Costs are controlled by provincial governments , which negotiate physician fees and hospital reimbursement . The system seems to work  --  and Canada spends 30 percent less per person than the U.S. <p> But the system would not work as well here . For starters , the discipline of Canada 's parliamentary government is better suited to the task of negotiating . U.S. oversight for banking , insurance and student loans inspires little confidence that Federal and state officials could weed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with government insurance : it stifles innovation . Providers have little incentive to improve the quality of their practices because they do n't reap the benefits . Indeed , Canada now gets a free ride , benefiting from changes in U.S. medical technology . By contrast , under managed competition providers would compete by innovating . <p> Unfettered competition would be insufficiently managed , leaving individuals , especially the chronically ill , at the mercy of providers . Government insurance would be insufficiently competitive , suppressing quality improvements . The best answer remains : Managed Competition . @@649966 Pledges <br> <br> I 've decided that life is a bit like a standardized test . Not putting down an answer because you fear it could be wrong will lower your overall score . Now , as many of my friends ( and a few of my enemies ) will tell you , I have a tendency to overanalyze . I 'm aware of this characteristic within myself , and I do my level best to overcome it . As a result , I have occasionally been known to make snap decisions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember what those nice folks at the Princeton Review told me , back when I was a green seventeen-year-old terrified I 'd never get into college : Narrow down your options and make an educated guess . <br> But be careful . You never know where that decision is going to take you . <br> Almost a year ago , I accepted the tap from Rose &amp; Grave , Eli University 's most powerful , exclusive , and notorious secret society . I knew my life would change . What I did n't realize was how . I figured my induction into their order would net me some contacts in my preferred field , add extra oomph to my resume , and provide an insurance plan for the future that loomed just beyond my next set of final exams . <br> What I did n't expect was that it would open my eyes to a whole world of my own potential . I no longer even wanted the job I 'd once hoped Rose &amp; Grave would help me get . I also did n't count on a host of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of associating with before  --  a few of whom I 'd actively disliked . I certainly never knew how much danger one little club membership could result in , though I 'd spent the last year being threatened , thwarted , chased , conspired against , and even once  --  bizarrely  --  kidnapped . <br> But most of all , I did n't realize that the following March , I 'd be sitting on a couch that looked like it had been fished out of the trash , staring at a guy I 'd never even have looked twice at , and wondering if I dared answer the following : <br> Amy Haskel , are you in love ? <br> A ) Yes <br> B ) No <br> C ) Insufficient Data to Answer This Question <br> Oh , hell , it 's C , which is why there was no way I was going to let our Spring Break fling end . He could n't do the secret hooking-up thing anymore ? Fine . We 'd try something new . <br> " I 'm really sick of secrets , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamie Orcutt is , it took him several seconds to parse the meaning of my statement . When he did , the kiss turned from hesitant to heated in no time at all . <br> Somehow we shifted from a relatively decent and G-rated side-to-side to something that rated the sort of parental supervision we had zero interest in at the moment . And , say what you will about how the couch looked , it certainly felt comfortable once I was sandwiched deeply between the cushions and Jamie . I clung to his shoulders as if I were drowning and he knotted his fists into my shirt , sliding the material away from my skin as his mouth moved south over my throat . <br> " Ja . . . " I said on a sigh , and then , as his tongue flicked over my collarbone , " Puh . . . " <br> He lifted his head . " You are never going to get it straight , are you ? " <br> " Unlikely . " I slid my hands down his back , to where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tough enough to even think of you as Jamie and not as  --  " Poe . I stopped myself in time to avoid the fine that punished us for using our society code names beyond the confines of the tomb . <br> " This is troublesome , " he said . " But then again , that 's your society name . " He tapped my nose . <br> Bugaboo . Yes , and he 'd probably had a hand in choosing it , too , now that I thought about it . Malcolm would n't have been so snarky on his own . " You want to know what 's even more troublesome ? " I scooted up . " Our real names rhyme . " <br> He chuckled . " Yeah , they do . I never thought of that . " <br> " People are going to laugh whenever they say things like , ' We should invite Amy and Jamie to the party next weekend ' or ' Let 's go on a double date with Amy and Jamie . ' ? " <br> He frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates with your friends ? Maybe this is n't such a good idea . " <br> Especially since the majority of said friends had no particular love for him . " I 'm just saying , ' Amy and Jamie ' sounds a bit pathetic . " <br> But he was smiling . " I was just thinking how nice it sounds . " <br> I blushed , and just as quickly , the concerns started crowding into my head . What kind of person gets into a relationship less than two months before graduating from college ? Was I mad ? Jamie was in law school , here , at Eli , for the next two years . I had no idea where I 'd be . When I left town at the end of May , there was no way our relationship would be ready for the long-distance thing ( if it even lasted until then ) , and I had no intentions of sticking around New Haven for a boyfriend I 'd just started dating . This was silly . I was setting myself up for an even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . <br> " What ? " He shook his head in disbelief . " I do n't think so . You ca n't just show up on my doorstep , drop this bombshell on me , then disappear . " <br> " I have work to do . . . " I began vaguely . <br> " You just got off a twenty-hour car trip . " He caught my hands in his . " You have relaxing to do . " His thumbs slid over the scabs on my wrists and we both winced . He looked down . " I 'm glad I was n't there that night , " he said softly . " I do n't think I would have trusted myself . " <br> " You ? Mr. In-Control Poe ? " Crap . <br> He wagged his finger at me . " See ? You ca n't keep it straight . And yeah . I might have killed that kid . " <br> " You would n't have been alone . " Half my club had wanted to kill Darren Gehry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dangerous version of what the teenager had convinced himself was a society prank . I was the only person who understood that we might have been to blame for giving him that impression. #* <br> My hands escaped Jamie 's and twisted around each other in my lap . He noticed , in the way he has of noticing everything . <br> " Stay here for a while , " he said . " I 'll cook something for you and we can talk . You can ask me all those personal questions you 've been so relentlessly curious about , and I can . . . " He trailed off . <br> #*And some of my friends were still muttering the word " Stockholm " in my vicinity . <br> He could what ? Give me a foot massage ? Seduce me ? Lecture me about the importance of tofu in cuisine ? He knew everything about me already . He had exhaustively researched my past when they 'd tapped me into Rose &amp; Grave . Scary thought . I 'd never before dated a guy who could name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my worst fears and how best to exploit them . <br> It 's kind of like dating your stalker . <br> " We 're a little past first-date conversation where I 'm concerned , " I said . Of course , back when he 'd done all that research , he 'd felt nothing for me but contempt . In Jamie 's opinion , I had n't been good enough for Rose &amp; Grave . He 'd changed his mind now , though . Right ? <br> He cupped my face in his hands and kissed me , and all my fears dissolved . " We 're a little past first dates , too . " <br> After dinner , Jamie walked me back to the gates of Prescott College . I swiped my proximity card at the sensor and pulled open the door . " Well , " I said . <br> He rested his hand on the bars . " Well . " A flash of memory : Jamie gripping these same bars last semester as we shouted at each other . I would n't let him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , with whom I 'd been sleeping in a no-strings-attached affair that now seemed beyond alien . Who was that girl , Amy ? <br> " Come up for a minute , " I went on . " You 've never seen my suite . " <br> Here 's something new : When Jamie looks at me now , his eyes , those cold gray eyes of his , almost smile . I did n't know eyes could do that . <br> We wandered through the courtyard , which remained mostly devoid of students . Spring Break had come to a shuddering stop as folks drifted back to campus . Some of the windows overlooking the courtyard were illuminated , but the suite I shared with Lydia remained dark . <br> Jamie caught my hand as I crested the steps to my entryway and tugged me back into his arms . <br> I laughed inside the kiss . " If this is supposed to demonstrate our new ability to kiss in public , you picked a pretty pathetic venue . No one 's here . " <br> " Baby steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the entryway . As I wrestled with the doorknob to our suite , he nibbled along the neckline of my shirt . I flicked on the lights to the common room , but Jamie showed no interest in our dTcor ; he just pulled me onto his lap on the couch and started kissing me for real . <br> A moment later , someone cleared a throat . <br> I looked up to see Lydia and Josh standing in the doorway to her bedroom . The former looked amused , the latter , gobsmacked . <br> " You 're home ! " Lydia said , then looked at Jamie . " And you have a guest . " <br> I slid off Jamie 's lap and we stood , knees knocking against the coffee table . " Just got home , " I said . " I did n't realize you were here . " <br> " Clearly , " my best friend replied , not even trying to hide her glee . She shoved her hand at Jamie . " I 'm Lydia , Amy 's roommate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Jamie Orcutt . " <br> " Nice to meet you . " <br> He then turned to Josh . " Jamie , " he said , and stuck out his hand . <br> Josh shook himself free from shock . " Um , Josh , " he said , a moment too late , and with a complete lack of believability . <br> Continues ...
