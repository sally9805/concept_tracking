Sometimes you can go home again <p> KATIE EMERGED FROM BEREAVEMENT COUNselling at the funeral home , made for a bus shelter bench , and wiped her tears . It would n't do to arrive at Darren 's high-rise office looking a wreck . Dinner with Darren and the theatre afterwards was supposed to get her mind off her father 's death . In a minute , she would hop on the bus and be whisked away to downtown Toronto . Striding in , swishing her expensive coat , her body language would tell Darren 's sexy secretary : " Back off , he 's mine . " Ten years earlier her women friends oohed and aahed over her boy-toy , Darren , 26 to her 36 . Now those friends had faded away . So had the magic with Darren . She gazed at the old brick houses across the street . Twenty years ago she had lived in a similar house , " The Cabin . " Situated near the university , it had housed herself , Ron , Melanie , Jodie , Carlene , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalling how the cats often joined her in her attic room , excited by birds on the roof outside . Father 's fondest wish was to kill a plump pigeon . Mother just lay on the quilt and worked her claws in the fabric , purring like a lawn mower . Katie missed cats . Darren did n't like hair on his three  --  piece suits . He said : " How about a nice goldfish ? " Not as funny as jokes with the old gang . She never saw them nowadays . Katie should have phoned Jodie long ago , but Darren did n't like Stan , Jodie 's husband . A " typical babyboomer , " he called him . Was Melanie still in England ? What of Carlene ? Living with her latest boyfriend , probably . And here was Ron , coming down the steps of the funeral home . Ron ? Her mind was playing tricks . But who else walked with such perfect posture ? She was on her feet , running in high heels . " Ron ! Ron . " He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She puffed up to him . " Ron . It 's wonderful to see you . " " You 're looking wonderful too . And prosperous . " He still wore a tweed jacket over denims , as in student days . She nodded toward the funeral home . " I was at bereavement counselling . My father died two months ago . " " I was paying my respects to a friend . " He could read her thoughts . " Not my partner , but another member of the gay community . I 've been to so many funerals . " And after a brief pause , " Did you know Carlene has AIDS ? " Katie gasped . " I did n't know , " she whispered . " Where is she ? " " A hospice . I see her regularly , but there 's little response any more . She 's semi-conscious . " " Oh , my God . That 's awful . " They spoke of their old housemate . Katie asked about Ron 's job . He was still at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her work , then : " Still with Darryl ? " " Darren . " " Cute guy . He did n't take to me . He knew right away that we do n't play on the same team . " She laughed . " You exaggerate . " Seven or eight years earlier , she and Darren had joined her old friends for brunch . Afterwards , Darren said her friends were aging hippies . " Darren and I are workaholics , " she told Ron . " It 's been difficult to find time to attend these bereavement sessions . Let 's get a coffee . " Her heart thumped . She did n't want to lose contact with her old friend so soon . Looking around , they saw no restaurants . He glanced at his watch . " I have to be somewhere promptly at 4:30 . Could we do lunch sometime ? Your treat though , cause I 'm skint . " They set a time and place just as her bus came along . She looked out the window . Ron watched her go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HER GLASS of chardonnais . " Grief counselling must be helpful . " She shrugged . Although she 'd done it anyway , Darren had objected to her visiting her dad 's sickbed , arguing that it was time-consuming and costly , and she normally only saw her dad once a year . How dare he sympathise now ? Funny . It took the stroke , and her father 's speechlessness , to make her wish she could talk to him . After her mother 's death and his early retirement , her dad devoted his time to fishing . They had n't had much to talk about . " Good news , " Darren announced . " I got the big account . So , shall we buy the condo ? " " Let 's wait awhile . " If she were to move downtown again , she 'd prefer an older house , like the one her " intentional family " had rented . Sentimental ! You could n't go back . Eating her calamari , she recalled spaghetti suppers in the old kitchen at The Cabin , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's practice-teaching students during his teachers " college year . Around the table , they would proofread Melanie 's thesis . " Thanks , guys ! If I get that scholarship to England , you can all come and visit me . " So far as Katie knew , none of the old gang had . The family had never proofread Katie 's own thesis , because she never completed it . Instead , they comforted her when her academic advisor quit , leaving her high and dry . At the same round table they held a family conference , called by Jodie after her boyfriend Stan proposed . " Should I marry him ? I want the truth . " Among the reasons " for , " was Jodie 's unhappiness in teaching . Stan would give her a new role : wife and mother . To Jodie , children were little no-neck monsters . Stan , however , wanted them . " Marry him , " Katie blurted . " Work out the details later . Remember , housework is relatively easy . I wish someone would marry me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit forty , we 'll get married . " Ron 's eyes twinkled . " We 'll spend our old age together . " " It 's a deal ! " " Could we get back to my problem , please ? " Jodie demanded . Carlene , putting on eye make-up while waiting for her date , voted No . " So many gorgeous men in the world ! Do n't confine yourself to one ! " The cat known as Mother strolled into the kitchen , rubbed against Jodie 's legs , and meowed . They all laughed . " Ignore Mother , " said Melanie . " What does she know ? She 's spayed . Father is neutered . " Drinking wine , they got sillier . They decided Jodie should talk things through with Stan . " If you say no , you can always stay on here . We are n't going anywhere , " Ron said . But Ron was the first to move out . He quit teachers " college , believing that the straight world would never accept him in education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England . Jodie married Stan . Katie , with her stalled thesis and no job prospects , phoned her father and asked him to stake her to a college course in computer programming . Computers were fairly new then . Soon her financial problems were over . She loved her work . She dated some , but told her friends she was going to become the man , career-wise , that she had once wanted to marry . And lo and behold , when she quit looking , Darren appeared . Since Darren did n't like Ron , she was glad she would be lunching with her old friend alone . A WEEK LATER , WHEN SHE ENTERED THE RESTAUrant , Ron was sipping coffee . " Remember Jodie 's stag party at Slippery 's ? " he began , as she settled across from him . " Slippery 's Bar and Grille ! You mentioned it in your toast to the bride . That really annoyed Jodie 's mother . We 've had entirely too many references to that pub ! " " This reminiscence unleashed a flood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with them ? Father bounced into the car and perched on the headrest to enjoy the drive . " " Mother hid under the sofa and had to be coaxed out with salmon . " " Such sweethearts ! " Katie exclaimed . " I wanted to take them , but my new apartment was too cramped . I wonder how they are . " Ron 's brows arched . " Probably they 're happy in that big cat house in the sky . " She sighed . " The years have flown by ! " " The cats were great , " Ron conceded . " Mother cuddling up against me at night gave me the nerve to quit teachers " college . " A young waiter approached their table , eyebrows raised . " It was so relaxing , drifting off to sleep with Father lying on my abdomen ! " Smiling up at the waiter , she explained that Mother and Father were cats . " Five of us formed an intentional family , " and someone said a family needs a mother and father . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't the type , " Ron chipped in . " Father was grey and fluffy . Part Persian . Mother was black with a touch of rust in certain lights . " " Ah ... would you care to order ? " asked the waiter . Afterwards , Ron leaned forward . " Remember that time on the bus ? " Katie nodded . " You said : I 'm going to ask Dr. Beane about getting Father neutered . " The elderly woman ahead of us nearly fainted . " " Remember that food store check-out line ? I 'd been away , practice-teaching , and asked what was new . You said : Nothing much , except that Mother has started shitting in the window boxes . " The woman ahead of us put her hands over her little girl 's ears . " They laughed . " I miss cats , " she sighed . " Stephanie has a yellow cat , Garfield . She claimed it followed her home . " " Stephanie ? Have you gone straight , Ron , after all these years ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember ? Only you picked Dagwood-er-Darren . Actually , I found Mr. Right , too , only ... " His voice faltered . " I 'm so sorry . " " Evan died two years ago . Incidentally , I test negative . Safe sex . After he died , Carlene asked me to move in with her and her mother and her daughter Stephanie . " Ron had bumped into their old housemate at a meeting for friends of people with HIV . The best way of coping with his grief , he thought , might be to help someone else , so he accepted Carlene 's invitation to move into her mother 's old house near the campus . Cutbacks in student grants had reduced the elderly woman 's rental income . Disabled with arthritis , Carlene 's mum found it hard meeting her mortgage payments . Ron 's rent kept them hanging on . " We live day to day . Carlene ca n't last much longer . Stephanie is ten . If they have to go into public housing later , I do n't know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a worry . " He glanced at his watch . He had to leave promptly at 2:00 , to pick up Stephanie from school and take her to visit Carlene . Over the meal , Katie turned the conversation to happier subjects . Had he seen Jodie lately ? Ron had contacted her to tell her of Carlene 's illness . She sent flowers weekly . " She said she 'd love to get together with the old gang . Melanie is coming back from England . " " Let 's all have lunch here next week ! " He nodded . " Fine . I 'll phone them . It will take my mind off Carlene . " He rose to go . Katie 's heart pounded . She had her car , and the afternoon free . But how could she face Carlene ? How could she deal with another terminal illness ? As Darren would say , " Who needs it ? " She blurted , " I 'll drive you . " His face lit up . " Thanks . " " THERE 'S NO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination . " I 'll wait in the car . " " There 's a spot ! " Stephanie shot a skinny arm past Katie and pointed to a car just pulling out . Katie parked . " Are n't you coming in to see Mummy ? " Katie swallowed . How could she refuse ? She gripped Ron 's hand . Her discomfort was soothed by smiling staff , walls with pictures and mementos , and soft music . Spring flowers bloomed on Carlene 's window sill . Carlene was propped up in bed , very thin , her skin transparent . Her smile and greeting were the same as ever . One minute she was conscious , then she drifted off Holding Ron 's hand , Stephanie kept talking to her mother . Katie went to a waiting room down the hall , where , five minutes later , she was joined by the little girl . " How do you know my mum and Ron ? " Katie began a once-upon-a-time story about the five roommates and the cats at home in The Cabin . Stephanie was delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says we ca n't really afford Garfield . " When Ron reappeared , Katie drove them both home . " Wo n't you come in ? " Stephanie asked . " Grandma always likes to meet Mum 's friends . " Touched , Katie begged off . There was n't time , not if she wanted to get home before Darren . A FEW DAYS LATER , RON PHONED TO SAY THAT Melanie and Jodie were on for lunch . " I 'm anxious to see how time has treated our siblings , so to speak , " Ron drawled , as she manoeuvred through traffic . " I wonder if Jodie is still as hot for Stan ? " Katie , who was nervous , cast a grateful glance in his direction . He always tried to make her feel better . The memory of the passionate pair made her chuckle . No one who lived at The Cabin would have objected if Jodie had taken Stan up to her room , but instead , she preferred to play out their courtship in the communal living room . Night after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pretending to watch TV . The others muttered that it was their living room too . It was embarrassing to come in to catch the 10 o'clock news and find them engaged in near-sex on the sofa . When Melanie suggested to Jodie that she and Stan take it upstairs , Jodie had looked shocked , protesting , " I do n't want to look cheap ! " They laughed . " Do you remember the time we tried to give them a taste of their own medicine ? " Ron asked . Katie giggled . The effort had failed . She and Ron had decided , at one point , that Jodie must be unaware of how her intimacies with Stan embarrassed her roomies . They decided to show her . One late afternoon , when Jodie was due home from school , Katie , fully clothed , lay down on the hall carpet . Ron , also clad , positioned himself over her . When the door opened , they began to pant and squeal . " Oh , Ron ! " " Oh , Katie ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking around them to hang up her coat . Katie , on Ron 's arm , entered the restaurant laughing at the memory . Their friends were already at the table . She would have recognized them anywhere , though Jodie 's hair was a paler blonde , and Melanie 's dark curls were frosted now . They embraced and began catching up on things . " None of you ever came to see me in England . Well , it 's too late , " Melanie informed them . " I 'm back for good . " Her tenure at her British university counted for nothing here where she was starting over as a part-time lecturer , an entry-level job . Why had she left England , Katie wondered ? Melanie told stories about her love of the countryside and new English friends , but eventually homesickness for her family brought her back to Canada . She sighed . " Do any of you know of a place I could live , with reasonable rent ? I ca n't stay out at my folks " farm indefinitely . My family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowding them . They had to stand in line for the bathroom as it was , even before I got there . " " I 'm looking for a place , myself , " Jodie said . " I 'm leaving Dr. Stan . " The others listened as she spoke of her early years of marriage , guinea-pigged by fertility experts . " Raging hormones and miscarriages kept me in a state for years . I was n't fit company . That 's why I never phoned you all . " After a hysterectomy , she threw herself into volunteer work and tried to ignore Stan 's affairs . She was afraid to leave , until she told herself that a woman who could raise thousands of dollars for charity ought to be able to find some way to make ends meet . She looked from Melanie to Katie to Ron . " I really missed all of you . If only we could go back in time . " Then she was fumbling for a handkerchief . Katie handed her a napkin , as her own eyes blurred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat stories . She pressed me for more . I only told her things fit for young ears . The point is-you three could make a real difference in that kid 's life . She has no one but her grandmother , and me . No extended family . No aunts . " Jodie bit her lip . " I 've never been good with kids , but , out of friendship for Carlene , I 'd like to do something for her . Would Stephanie like to go shopping ? " " I 'd like to help . Would her grandmother object to someone she did n't know befriending her granddaughter ? " Melanie asked Ron . He shook his head . " She 'd be grateful . " Melanie pulled out a daily planner . " Let 's draw up a schedule for visits to the hospice and things to make life easier for Stephanie and her grandmother , " she announced . " She 'll have three fairy godmothers , " Ron remarked . " And one fairy godfather , " Katie quipped . They rolled their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLANS ECHOING IN HER HEAD , Katie felt energetic . Home ahead of Darren , she put water on to boil for pasta , and was chopping vegetables when he came in . His expression told her something was wrong . " Something wonderful happened today , " she began . He held up his hand . " Katie , I have something to get off my chest . I ca n't live a lie any longer . " He dropped his bomb . He and his secretary were involved . " It 's purely physical . It has nothing to do with us . It 's just that you 've been so preoccupied . You wo n't let your father go . You 're stuck in the past . It 's as if we 're moving in different directions . " Katie looked at the knife , then at the boiling water . She set down the knife , switched off the stove , grabbed her purse , and left . Fighting her way through traffic , she decided she knew what was wrong all along . Darren was simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove to the neighbourhood where Ron lived with Stephanie and her grandmother . Parking out front , she slowly climbed the steps and rang the doorbell . The door jerked open abruptly . Ron was there , wild  --  eyed , pale . " Katie ! Carlene 's mother called me from the hospice . Carlene is gone . I want to go there , but Stephanie is n't back from Brownies yet . Could you stay here , and break the news ? And ... can I borrow your car ? I 'll be back as soon as can . " Of course . " As he vanished into the street , she sank into a comfortable , worn chair in the living room . On a shelf was a framed photograph of an elderly woman , a grinning , freckled Stephanie , and Carlene , in healthier days . She looked at the fireplace , smiling , remembering the way they hung up huge outsize stockings at Christmas , including two little ones for Mother and Father . One year , Carlene hung up a pair of sheer black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hands , she became aware of something soft and warm rubbing against her leg .

" Hi , I 'm home ! " Katie , with the cat in her arms , met Stephanie . " Hi , Katie . Where is everyone ? " No sooner were the words out of the little girl 's mouth , than she guessed . Her face crumpled . Katie took the child in her arms . Stephanie raised her teary face . " What will happen to me ? " Katie told her about the plans to help Stephanie and her grandmother . Then another idea dawned . Suppose they recreated the " intentional family " with Stephanie and her grandmother and all lived together again ?
