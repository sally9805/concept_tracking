Educators have their feet in two worlds . They work intimately with young people , addressing problems and issues of immediate concern and , at the same time , projecting needs for an uncertain future . One thing we do know for sure  --  tomorrow will be very different from today , in terms of the numbers of diverse individuals who will interact in order to accomplish their needs and to solve common problems . <p> Consider some of these statistics : It has been projected that by the year 2000 , 30 to 40 percent of the children in our nation 's schools will be of ethnic or national minority ( Hodgkinson 1985 ) . By the year 2000 , approximately 53 major American cities will have predominantly immigrant populations ( Brown 1986 ) . Teaching remains a predominantly white , middle-class profession with less than 12 percent of all teachers representing minority populations . About half of this number are presently teacher education students . <p> Our classrooms are changing . Teachers must be prepared to deliver effective instruction that considers the various backgrounds , prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns of interactions of the children in their charge . This approach has been appropriately called multicultural education or education that is multicultural in nature . <p> Equally important is the necessity that teachers prepare their students for the complex , interconnected world in which they will live . At the present time , four out of five new jobs are developed as a direct result of foreign trade . Over six-thousand American companies have branches overseas . The reverse is also true . Over six-thousand foreign companies have branch offices in the United States . The impact of all this change is obvious when we think that Honda of Ohio now exports automobiles to Japan . <p> The problems and challenges we face , however , reach far beyond corporate connections and needs . Young people must be educated with the sensitivity and skills required to address such concerns as the global environmental crisis , issues of war and peace , racism and prejudice , and world hunger . As Kneip ( 1989 , p. 399 ) so aptly put it , " For a number of our most pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be international solutions or no solutions at all . " <p> As the old adage goes , the times , they are changing ! Our students must be prepared for a world where they will interact extensively with people whose ways of thinking and behaving and whose hopes , fears , and dreams of the future are quite different from their own . Human Beings Resist Change <p> It is difficult to comprehend the opportunities and obstacles that will present themselves in the years ahead . We have no precedent in known human history of such extensive cultural interaction and interdependence . Bringing about the fundamental changes necessary to internationalize the educational experience completely demands attention to issues of both product and process . Americans in general , and educators in particular , have a history of searching for the " quick fix " to complex educational and social problems . We know , all too well , the pitfalls of such approaches  --  yet we continue to find it difficult to change our habitual approach and perspective . In the areas of international and intercultural education , there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small incremental steps that , when finally brought together , make the big picture possible . As such , we must be willing to measure our successes , not in miles , but in inches . <p> Of all the disciplines , the social studies has , by necessity as well as fit , taken on the bulk of responsibility for addressing international and global concerns . As social studies educators , we have an awesome responsibility . We must work with a double-edged sword , so to speak , as multiple dimensions of many peoples ' thinking and behavior must be affected . To be effective , the international dimension must emerge from all the disciplines and provide more than a surface glance . This article offers some concrete , practical strategies to facilitate the introduction of an international dimension across the curriculum . It begins by recognizing that some fundamental tendencies of human behavior exist that make change an extremely slow process . With this in mind , I would like to relate a story told by J. E. Rash , founder and president of Legacy International . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Environment Conference held in Cartagena , Spain , in August 1985 , begins as most stories do : <p> Once upon a time there was a group of people who lived in the mountains , in an isolated region . One day a stranger passed through their area and dropped some wheat grains in their fields . The wheat grew . After a number of years , people noticed the new plant and decided to collect its seeds and chew them . Someone noticed that when a cart had accidentally ridden over some of the seeds , a harder outer covering separated from the seed and what was inside was sweeter . Someone else noticed that when it rained , the grains that had been run over expanded a little , and the hot sun cooked them . So people started making wheat cereal and cracked wheat and other wheat dishes . Wheat became the staple of their diet . <p> Years passed . Because these people had no knowledge about crop rotation , fertilizers , and cross pollination , the wheat crop eventually began to fail . <p> As such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barley , happened by . He saw the people starving and planted some of his grain . The barley grew well . He presented it to the people and showed them how they could make bread and soup and many other dishes from barley . They , however , called him a heretic . " You are trying to undermine our way of life and force us into accepting you as our king . " They saw his trick . " You ca n't fool us . You are trying to weaken us and make us accept your ways . Our wheat will not let us starve . Your barley is evil . " <p> He stayed in the area , but the people avoided him . Years passed . The wheat crop failed again and again , and the children suffered from malnutrition . One day , the stranger came to the market and said , " Wheat is a grain . My barley has a similar quality . It is also a grain . Why do n't we just call the barley grain . " Now , because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for a few who staunchly refused . Those few loudly proclaimed that they were the only remaining followers of the True Way , the Religion of Wheat . New people joined the Wheat Religion from time to time , but most began to eat barley . They called themselves " The Grainers . " <p> For generations , the Wheat Religion people brought up their children to remember the true food called wheat . A few of them hoarded some wheat grains to keep the wheat safe and sacred . Others sent their children off in search of wheat , because they reasoned that if one person could happen by with barley , wheat also might be known somewhere else . <p> And so it went for decades , until the barley crop began to fail . The last few Wheat Religion people planted their wheat again . It grew beautifully , and because it grew beautifully , they grew bold and began to proclaim that their wheat was the only true food . Most people resisted and called them heretics . A few people said , " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> The wheat growers agreed , thinking that they could get many more wheat followers if they called it " grain . " But by this time , some of the children of the Wheat Religion followers began to come back from their adventures with new seeds  --  not just wheat , but rye and buckwheat and millet . With these new varieties , people began to enjoy the taste of many different grains . They took turns planting them and trading the seed with others . In this way , everyone came to have enough sustenance and lived happily ever after . <p> This story speaks to us on many levels . On one level , it is a celebration of diversity , demonstrating how a society can benefit and thrive when it welcomes and develops the potential of all its resources . On a deeper level , the story speaks of a more critical issue  --  peoples ' resistance to changing their familiar ways of thinking and acting . Human beings are creatures of habit who find it difficult to change , whether as individuals , institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But change we must , if we are to meet the complex needs of our world successfully . A Global Perspective <p> Just what does it mean when we state that education should be presented from an international or intercultural perspective . How can we begin to translate this perspective to children and youth in the schools to assure that they , as adults , will be able to manage in an interdependent world ? And how can this be accomplished when most teachers have limited cross-cultural or international competence ? <p> According to Robert Hanvey 's classic paper ( 1979 ) , a curriculum that promotes an international or global perspective should address the five dimensions noted here . Perspective Consciousness . This implies recognition or awareness on the part of the individual that he or she has a view of the world that is not universally shared , that this view of the world has been and continues to be shaped by influences that often escape conscious detection , and that others have views of the world that are profoundly different from one 's own . State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awareness of the prevailing world conditions and developments , including emergent conditions and trends such as population growth , migrations , economic conditions , resources and physical environment , political developments , science and technology , law , health , and internation and intra-nation conflicts . Cross-Cultural Awareness . This goal instills an awareness of the diversity of ideas and practices that can be found in human societies around the world and of how such ideas and practices compare . It involves some limited recognition of how the ideas and ways of one 's own society might be viewed from other vantage points . Knowledge of Global Dynamics . This facet develops a modest comprehension of key traits and mechanisms of the world system , with an emphasis on theories and concepts that may increase consciousness of global change . Awareness of Human Choices . This dimension demands some understanding of the problems of choice confronting individuals , nations , and the human species as consciousness and knowledge of the global system expands . It also implies a willingness to act in order to make change . Practical Applications for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be viewed as an add-on to an already crowded curriculum . Such efforts as the model-schools network assembled by The American Forum ( Kneip 1989 ) , various school district approaches ( DeKock and Paul 1989 ) , and school-based programs as the Future Problem Solving Program ( Crabbe 1989 ) attest to the possibility of large-scale infusion . Even without any largescale change , an international perspective can be integrated into the curriculum through international focus courses , internationalizing the disciplines , and internationalizing instructional methods and activities . <p> International focus courses can be found in such areas of study as anthropology , regional history , geography , global or world studies , foreign language study , arts and music , ethnic group studies , world religions , intercultural communication , and international business . These seem to be most appropriate at the secondary and tertiary levels and will not be addressed in detail here because they quite readily emerge from the various disciplines themselves . <p> Internationalizing the disciplines consists of incorporating the key elements of a global perspective into courses already being taught in every subject area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all levels , and in all content areas . For instance , in reading and language arts , students might analyze the portrayal of minorities and internationals in basal texts . Children 's literature can be used to present issues and concepts of relevance to international education . These books can also serve to prepare the young mind for later exposure to global issues . Dr. Seuss 's , The Lorax , for example , stresses concern for the environment , and his Butter Battle Book illustrates the futility of the arms buildup . The world 's various forms of English and English as an international language can be studied . Literature from non-American and non-British English writers can be used . A study of world literature should , in fact , encompass the world , not merely a Western perspective . The reactions of a variety of national and ethnic groups toward the issue of English as the official language , as recently proposed by many states in the United States , can be analyzed . Young people can be encouraged to correspond with youths in other countries . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agriculture , health , environment , pollution , and population growth . Solutions to global environmental problems might be proposed . This demands knowledge of intergroup relations and cross-cultural skills because diverse people and cultures must come together if problems are ever to be resolved . Although technology may be universal , its application is specific . The study of appropriate technology and the transfer of technology demand consideration and sensitivity to such things as local environment , culture , history , and language . The topic of unplanned change through biology and evolution can be introduced . Reactions of a variety of national and ethnic groups toward such issues as dumping our wastes overseas or inequities in energy use can be considered . For instance , students must realize that our consumption of resources is as problematic as another nation 's population growth . The global nature of systems such as climate , the water cycle , and the food or energy cycle can be studied , with stress placed on the connections of environmental problems on a global level . <p> In foreign language education , teachers might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonized people as well as the immigrant and refugee populations . They can consider the role of translators in international development work . Teachers can present a cross-cultural orientation for various places a particular language is spoken . Foreign languages can be taught through folk-songs , and English as a second language can be introduced to foreign language teachers and students . <p> History and the social studies should explore differing perspectives on topics . Perhaps students could study the American Revolution by reading about it in other nations ' textbooks or discussing the events with international students . Folk-songs and story can be used to present cultural history . Issues of population growth , personal family migration , history , and cultural diffusion can become the focus of historical inquiry and so can the interaction between geography , culture , and the environment . <p> Math should emphasize the metric system . The United States is the only nation in the world that does not use that system . Math concepts can be illustrated by using problems that simultaneously teach about world trends . Traditional numeration systems from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be studied , including possible computer applications . A class might trace the impact that women had on the development of mathematics from ancient times through the early twentieth century . Students gain an international view when they play games from other cultures . <p> Internationalizing instructional methods , materials , and extracurricular activities might focus on cross-cultural interaction in the classroom with international , immigrant , and minority students as resources for formal classroom learning . Teachers can employ culturally appropriate instructional and assessment strategies . Text books and other material should be reviewed for portrayal of other cultures and intercultural interaction . Partnership programs with other schools and countries can be developed . <p> Those who internationalize extracurricular activities might consider informal intercultural interaction through games and music programs . Cooperative games , sports , music , and drama all have been shown to reduce prejudice and increase intercultural interaction . Supervisors need to encourage study abroad and international exchanges for faculty members . Begin with Self <p> Change must ultimately occur in the individual . The story presented earlier spoke of peoples ' resistance when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must accept and work with this fact . <p> We do have sufficient evidence to suggest that efforts designed to increase knowledge , as well as change peoples ' attitudes and behavior , can succeed over time . Curricular and other school-based efforts to reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations have proved to be successful . Slavin 's ( 1985 ) cooperative learning research demonstrated that cooperative efforts not only improve instructional effectiveness but also help to improve intergroup interaction . Cushner ( 1989 ) demonstrated that the use of a particular cross-cultural training strategy , known as a culture-general assimilator ( Brislin , Cushner , Cherrie , and Yong 1986 ) , can improve problem-solving strategies and reduce culture shock in the **30;167;TOOLONG context . <p> Teachers , too , must work to overcome their resistance . Comprehensive and sensitive educational material may be available that can be used in schools . This article offered suggestions of how teachers from many areas might stress the international dimension of their discipline . If , however , teachers do not perceive the need , are not comfortable and competent with diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as a foundation for further growth and development , education with an international perspective will not advance fast enough . Strategies are available to sensitize teachers to concepts involved in cross-cultural interaction . Ilola ( 1988 ) found the same culture-general assimilator referred to earlier ( Brislin et al . 1986 ) to be effective at increasing knowledge and understanding of cross-cultural interaction among preservice teachers . Similarly , courses are available at many colleges and universities , and opportunities exist for teachers to gain significant experience through international travel and overseas teaching assignments . All of these must be used to their fullest as teachers strive to increase the international dimension in their professional repertoire . <p>
