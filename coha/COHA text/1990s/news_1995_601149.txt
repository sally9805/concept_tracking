<p> Too conservative <p> Q : All of my retirement investments are in bank CDs , U.S. government mutual funds and global income funds . We 're not doing very well . What should we do ? <p> - Jim Wagner , 54 , <p> Chatsworth , Calif . <p> A : Diversify into stock mutual funds - immediately , says Jim Ruth , a financial planner in Gaithersburg , Md . Income-oriented investments historically have produced lower returns than stock investments . The past 50 years , the Standard &; Poor 's 500 stock index has returned an average 11.8% a year with dividends reinvested , says Ned Davis Research . Long-term government bonds have returned 5.2% . Put 25% of your portfolio in a conservative growth-and-income stock fund , Ruth says . <p> Pay mortgage early <p> Q : I 'm paying $ 350 more a month to pay off my 7% mortgage early . Should I keep paying off the mortgage early ? <p> - Mel Goff , 49 , <p> Colorado Springs <p> A : Pay off the mortgage as early as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you pay it , you wo n't have the federal income tax deduction for mortgage interest when you retire . But you 'll save in the long run . Suppose you had a $ 100,000 15-year mortgage . Your total principal and interest payments over that period would be $ 161,789 . Pay the loan in 7 1/2 years and your total falls to $ 128,479 . Once you 've paid the mortgage , take the same amount every month and invest it in a stock or bond mutual fund that will help generate income during retirement . <p> Too many IRAs ? <p> Q : I contribute to two individual retirement accounts . I can deduct my contributions to one , but I ca n't deduct my contributions to the other . Should I keep putting money into the non-deductible IRA ? <p> - Joe Denehy , New York <p> A : Yes , says financial planner Robert Albertson . Even if you do n't get a tax benefit for contributions , your earnings grow tax-deferred until the money is withdrawn . Keep the IRAs separate to simplify taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm saving 6% of my salary in my company 's 401(k) retirement plan , but want to boost that to 10% . I 'm 56 and plan to retire at age 62 . Is that a good idea ? <p> - Sam George , 56 , <p> Wilmington , Del . <p> A : Keep track of your income and expenses for six months , says financial planner Paul Newton of Bowie , Md . If the extra saving wo n't be too painful , boost your 401(k) contribution to the maximum $ 9,240 this year . " But do n't crimp your current lifestyle so much that you 're going to be miserable the next six years , " Newton says . <p> Fixed or variable ? <p> Q : I 'm thinking about investing $ 27,000 in a tax-deferred annuity as part of my retirement but do n't want to put my principal at risk . Should I choose a fixed or variable annuity ? <p> - Kenneth Shiner , 61 , <p> Kansas City , Mo . <p> A : A variable annuity lets you put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money market funds . It also puts your principal at risk . A fixed annuity pays a set interest rate , but that rate can be reset periodically , according to the terms of the annuity . If you 're dead set against losing principal , consider a fixed annuity , which is guaranteed by the insurance company ( pick a healthy one ) . But you wo n't have much chance of beating inflation , says Ray Ferrara , financial planner from Clearwater , Fla . A variable annuity , invested in bond funds , will carry some risk - but should provide higher returns . <p> Bad timing <p> Q : Last fall , my husband and I became worried about the stock market and moved $ 90,000 of our retirement investments from stocks to a guaranteed income contract . Should we get back into the market now ? <p> - Cheryl Davis , 49 , <p> Pompano Beach , Fla . <p> A : " Your timing is unfortunate , " says Jocelyn Kaplan , a financial planner from Falls Church , Va . The S &P; 500-stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy stocks when they 're down - when they 're cheapest . Now you 're afraid to get back in because stocks seem to be racing to new highs almost every day . Your best bet : Keep a set percentage of your portfolio in stocks at all times , no matter what the stock market does . Because you are 49 and your husband is 55 , you should have 25% to 50% of your investments in stocks , depending on your risk tolerance . Kaplan suggests taking $ 10,000 a month out of your GIC and putting it back into stock funds . <p> Cut the cards <p> Q : I 'm expecting a $ 3,000 tax refund . Should I invest it or use it to pay off the $ 1,000 balance on my credit card - which carries an interest rate of 14.9% - or my $ 5,000 loan balance at 8.5% ? The loan will be paid off in three years . <p> - Scott Flagg , 30 , <p> Aurora , Colo . <p> A : Pay off that expensive credit card debt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Va . - unless you can make more than 14.9% by investing the extra cash . You probably do n't need to accelerate your loan payments . Historically , stocks return almost 12% a year , so investing your refund in a stock mutual fund should pay off . <p> Stocks or funds ? <p> Q : Which are better for retirement saving : mutual funds or individual stocks ? <p> - Wendell Walker , Detroit <p> A : If you 're just starting out , stick with stock mutual funds , says Alexandra Armstrong , financial planner at Armstrong , Welch &; MacIntyre in Washington , D.C. Most experts say you should have five or 10 individual stocks to have a properly diversified portfolio . That costs some money : 100 shares of 10 $ 20 stocks would cost $ 20,000 . When you buy a mutual fund , you 're buying a slice of a diversified , professionally managed portfolio of stocks . Most mutual funds will let you start an IRA for $ 500 or less . And if your company has a 401(k) plan , you probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Lump sum payout ? <p> Q : After 24 years of work , I was laid off last year . I have to decide whether to transfer my six-figure pension account to a lifetime annuity or take it in a lump sum from the company . What should I do ? - Gary Anderson , 49 , Granger , Ind . <p> A : For most people , taking the retirement distribution as a lump sum makes the most sense . There 's very little flexibility in an annuity once you 've made the decision to go that way . This is a once-in-a-lifetime decision and the lump sum option offers you more control of the money . To keep it tax-deferred , roll it into an IRA . <p> Pension woes <p> Q : I 'm 46 . I think my pension with Eastern Airlines is gone because of Eastern 's bankruptcy . I have $ 50,000 in retirement savings . Will I be able to retire ? - Rodger Van Ausdale , 46 , Seattle <p> A : Do n't give up on your Eastern pension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation , a U.S. government agency that guarantees pension plans . You will still get pension benefits when you reach retirement age . However , you 'll get them from the PBGC . If you have questions about a failed pension plan , write to the PBGC at 1200 K Street NW , Washington , D.C. 20005 . Even with your pension , though , you 'll need to keep saving . And you should put at least half your savings in stock market investments , such as stock funds , which typically earn more than bonds or bond funds over the long term . Adjust portfolio ? <p> Q : Should I adjust my current asset allocation ? I have $ 73,000 in an IRA , split among several funds : 32% in funds that invest in large , U.S. stocks ; 25% in global bonds ; 22% in a balanced stock and bond fund ; 17% in international . - David Rishell , 44 , Chicago <p> A : You paid a sales charge when you bought these mutual funds through a stockbroker . Get asset allocation help from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broker earn his keep , " says planner Peter Palion of New York City . But you should probably reduce your exposure to volatile international bonds and seek out a fund that invests in small-company stocks . Historically , small stocks - although generally riskier - have outperformed stocks of large companies . <p> Q : I 'm thinking of retiring early . I have about $ 1 million worth of investment assets , including my retirement plan . Will I be able to retire now and draw down $ 50,000 annually ? <p> - Jerry Bayless , 55 , <p> Decatur , Ill . <p> A : Assuming an 8% return on your portfolio and 4% inflation , you can withdraw 4% of your portfolio value - or $ 40,000 - each year to start , says planner John Eckel of Simsbury , Conn . Another 4% should be reinvested to protect your portfolio from inflation . This approach leaves you $ 10,000 short of your annual goal . Once you reach age 62 , you 'll be eligible for Social Security , which will help . Otherwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more each year ; or invest aggressively . <p> Q : I 'm investing $ 200 a month by putting about $ 50 into four stock funds . I have one diversified stock fund , one utility and two science sector funds . Should I add an international fund ? - Charmaine Duncan , Los Angeles <p> A : Absolutely . That would balance your portfolio and help you get to your goal faster : retiring at 48 . International stocks got killed in 1994 and they 've done little so far this year . " Now 's the time to buy because they 're cheap , " says Joseph Kopczynski , financial planner from Albuquerque . <p> Of course , last year 's volatility has scared many investors away from international stocks  --  but that 's a big mistake . There 's a lot of power in foreign stocks . Today , 60% of thw world 's stock market capitalization is in foreign stocks ; 25 years ago , 66% was in U.S. stocks .
