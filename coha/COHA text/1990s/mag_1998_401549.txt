" I design whatever I feel . " // Hollywood 's homebodies go under cover with Judi Boisson 's handmade quilts and coverlets Judi Boisson admits she has a quilt complex . It dates back to 1976 and a New York City-to-Dallas road trip . Packed into a rusty Oldsmobile in 110-degree heat with two friends and her two adolescent daughters , Boisson still could n't resist stopping at a run-down Texarkana antique store . Inside , she remembers , she was drawn to " the cutest little patchwork . " Price : $5 . Thrilled by the find , she began searching for more . By trip 's end , she 'd piled some 20 quilts on top of her suitcases-and her kids . From then on , recalls Boisson 's daughter Baret : " Wherever we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store . I hated it . But now we know she 's a genius . " She 's certainly savvy . In 1979 , Boisson began peddling vintage quilts at a shop she opened in Southampton , N.Y . Nineteen years later , she 's running an $8 million-ayear business creating and manufacturing her own designs . To produce her line , which also includes pillows and rugs ( priced from $20 for a baby heart pillow to $1,295 for a king-size Basket Trapunto quilt ) and which are sold through her $10 Judi Boisson American Home Collection mail-order catalog , Boisson employs some 3,000 people in eight factories across China . " The way we make our quilts , " she boasts of her hand-sewn creations , " is exactly the way they made them in the 1880s . You can almost look at an American quilt and imagine what a family was like . " Her exacting standards have helped the 57-year-old Boisson sew up a long list of Hollywood clients . Helen Hunt picked a white grape cluster throw ( $595 ) , while Kim Basinger chose Boisson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one I got from Judi was actually an antique , " says model Kathy Ireland , who owns 12 Boisson blankets . " Most of the ones I have now are new . They 're much more affordable , and they 're beautiful . " Other celebs , such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Steven Spielberg , have bought Boisson blankets for their children . " They 're giving the baby something that can be handed down from generation to generation , " says Lisa Gorevitz , a vice president at Barneys New York , which sells Boisson 's kids ' covers . " We love her quilts . " Boisson 's background is as colorful as one of her patchworks . The middle of three daughters of Edwin Schweig , a lawyer , and Sarah , a homemaker , she grew up in Woodmere , N.Y. , where , even as a child , she had a taste for homegrown art . " I loved creating sculptures with candies , " she says . " I also painted frames around my pictures on the walls . " Boisson studied art at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence . There , in 1962 , she married fellow art student Bob Testen ; daughter Baret was born in 1963 and Erin followed 18 months later . Soon after , they moved to Suriname , in South America , where Testen ran a shrimping company owned by Boisson 's father and Judi raised their girls . In her free time she explored the jungles , observing the native Indians and collecting their artifacts . After splitting from Testen in 1968 , Judi met and married Philippe Boisson , a French lumber mill owner , the following year . In 1970 the family moved to Dallas , where Boisson took her first job , as a sales agent for a clothing company . Crisscrossing the South on business , she stopped at every yard sale she passed , always looking to add to her folk art and , later , quilt collections . " My taste was very unsophisticated . I bought what I loved , " says Boisson . " At the time I was one of the only people who wanted the pastel midwestern quilts . One woman thanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photograph Michelle Pfeiffer chose a McDonaid 's Farm quit for her children . Boisson 's Alphabet quilt suited Demi Moore and her kids to a " T. " Photograph " I have very artistic daughters , " says Boisson of Baret ( left ) and Erin ( with husband Dominique Aries and baby Olivia , 9 months ) . // Boisson 's prescience paid off when she opened her Southampton store after her second marriage ended in 1979 . As her antique bedspreads quickly sold , she found replacing them increasingly difficult . " I just was n't finding beautiful quilts , " she says . " They were already in people 's collections . " And when she did find a gem , customers were often wary of buying it for fear it would fall apart when washed . " People wanted fresh quilts , " she says . " I was missing a huge market . " So in 1991 Boisson began designing her own quilts . Sales proved so brisk that she closed her store three years later to devote herself to mailorder sales . To help handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Erin began overseeing sales . These days , Boisson spends hours on end sprawled on the hardwood floor of her 100-year-old Victorian Southampton home sketching new designs . She draws inspiration from her collection of Americana-including a model farm made from junk items and a hand-painted Mickey Mouse . " Many of them were made by fathers who wanted to make something for their children . They made them out of love , " she says . " That 's how I feel about my quilts .
