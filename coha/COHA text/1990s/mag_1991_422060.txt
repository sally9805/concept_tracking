Section : CROSS CURRENT <p> Poujadism was a movement of small businessmen founded to protest against sales tax in southern France . It began life in the summer of 1953 when Pierre Poujade founded the Union de Defense des Commercants et Artisans ( UDCA ) in the small town of St Cere , and by January 1956 it was sufficiently important to gain fifty- two seats in parliament . Few people now remember the precise details of Poujadism 's history , but the word Poujadist enjoyed a second lease of life during the 1980s as a term of general political abuse . A journalist wrote a book on La France Poujadiste in which almost every disagreeable feature of French public life was described as a symptom of Poujadism . In England the word has been used repeatedly with reference to one politician : Margaret Thatcher . Denis Healey described the then prime minister as a ' piggy bank Poujadist ' while the historian Ross Mckibbin described her as a ' neo-Poujadist ' ; Dr Mckibbin has apparently spent many hours in his study reflecting on the differences between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mock the equation of Poujadism and Thatcherism . The most marked elements in Poujade 's canon - opposition to big business , anti-Americanism , distaste for Jewish ministers , support for reflationary economics , and intense respect for the revolutionary traditions of 1789 - were not normally associated with Margaret Thatcher . but is would be a pity to dismiss the comparison so quickly because Thatcher and Poujade did share certain origins , and examining why they came to take such different positions may tell us something about the recent history of England and France as well as about the use and misuse of historical comparison . <p> Pierre Poujade and Margaret Thatcher made much of their background in the lower middle class ; both stressed the solidity of this background presenting the corner shop as the repository of thrift , hard work and family life . But in reality the lower middle classes of both France and England have been characterised in recent years by extreme instability : individuals pass through this class on their way between poverty and prosperity . The families of both Pierre Poujade and Margaret Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done so from the opposite ends of the social spectrum . Margaret Roberts ' father rose into the lower middle class ( his own father had been a shoemaker ) and kept on rising so that by 1943 he owned two shops and was wealthy enough to send his daughter to Oxford . Poujade , by contrast , had wealthy , perhaps even noble , ancestors , but his architect father died young leaving the family fortunes to decline so badly that Poujade was obliged to leave school at fourteen . <p> The upbringings of Poujade and Thatcher were distinguished not merely by the fact that they belonged to different sections of the lower middle class ; there were also important differences in the position of the lower middle class as a whole in France and Britain . In England shopkeepers had the siege mentality that came from being a small group in a largely proletarian nation . They sought to separate themselves from their less respectable neighbours while aping the manners of their social betters ; this was a world that bred meanness , suspicion and snobbery . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property owners , like peasants and artisans , were numerous . In small southern towns they made up the majority of the population and there was no significant working class to fear and despise . Poujade grew up in close and friendly contact with his neighbours in a world that valued sociability and rough mateyness ; as a young man he gained a reputation as a drinker , an athlete , and a streetfighter . Meanwhile Margaret Hilda Roberts supported her father 's campaign to prevent the citizens of Grantham from playing bowls on Sunday afternoons . <p> This difference in background was to have important consequences for the politics of Thatcher and Poujade . Thatcherism is a creed of merciless individualism founded on the assumption that there is no such thing as society ' . Poujadism emphasised the importance of collective life . Its most effective tactics ( strikes , demonstrations , and mass meetings ) were those that Englishmen associate with the working class . The ends as well as the means of Poujadist politics were collectivist : in a France that was becoming divided between capitalist defenders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's journal , Fraternite Francais . Poujade 's economic vision was not of a free market : he was in favour of the forty hour week , reflationary government spending and high wages . It is true that his movement began as an anti-tax protest , but this was not a generalised attack on state spending but rather a specific and limited assault on a particular variety of tax that was seen to be unjust . Poujadism 's fiscal protest was more like that of the anti-Poll Tax federation than that of Aims of Industry . <p> For the first year of so of its existence Poujade 's UDCA worked in alliance with the Communist Party . Gradually this alliance broke up and Poujade began to be associated with leaders of the French extreme right like Tixier-Vignancour and Dorgeres . However , even the right-wing Poujadism of the late 1950s bore very few resemblances to Thatcherism . Thatcherism was a primarily , if not exclusively , economic creed . By contrast , the issues that lead Poujade to be associated with the right were non economic ones : his defence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his support for the French presence in Algeria after de Gaulle 's return to power in 1958 . Even Poujade 's split with the Communist Party was a result of his refusal to have his movement controlled rather than of any desire to defend capitalism , and Poujade always directed more of his invective at the USA than the USSR . <p> The distinct nature of the French and English lower middle classes accounts for many of the differences between the careers of Thatcher and Poujade . Thatcher sometimes presented herself as the representative of lower middle class values but the only value that she inherited from her class , perhaps the only common value that it has , is an attachment to social mobility or in other words a desire to escape from the lower middle class . Poujade sought to improve the lot of his class rather than to escape from it . Thatcher talks with an elocution teachers ' voice and regards Dulwich as too provincial , while Poujade flaunted an Auvergne accent and kept his base in St. Cere . <p> These differences in social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's closest associates have usually been members of the establishment . Her cabinets have been filled with Etonians and Fellows of All Souls ; the companies most closely associated with her - Hanson , Rothschilds , News International - are all owned by men who were born very rich . Poujade , on the other hand , had almost nothing to do with the Parisian haut bourgeois ; only 16 percent of the Poujadist MPs elected in 1956 had finished their secondary schooling ; almost alone among non-Communist politicians Poujade refused subsidy from the representative of French big business , Andre Boutemy . <p> There is another important difference between Thatcherism and Poujadism . The former developed in government while the latter gained its greatest successes by working outside the political system , and sometimes outside the law . In 1979 no one believed that there was anything special about Margaret Thatcher except her sex . Her radicalism became obvious as she governed and she used the power given by a large majority , a disciplined party and ruthless parliamentary whips to impose that radicalism on the country . Poujade never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political system . This was partly because Poujade 's early appeal had been based on apoliticism and consequently disappeared when he established an explicitly political party . It was also because the clientism , patronage and constantly changing governments of the Fourth Republic made it difficult for a party leader to impose discipline on his troops . In 1958 almost none of the Poujadist MPs followed their leaders ' instructions to vote against de Gaulle . <p> The aspect of Poujadism that would have caused most distress to Thatcher and her supporters was his lack of respect for law and order : Poujade 's supporters greeted the riot police with cries of ' CRS/SS ' fifteen years before the same cry was taken up by left-wing students in Paris . This contempt for law was a product of France 's recent political history . Poujade , and most of his supporters , were in their mid- thirties . They had been young during the German Occupation of France when breech of the law was often seen as a patriotic duty . Poujade himself had joined the Maquis in 1943 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison , to join the Free French . <p> But the Poujadists ' willingness to resort to illegality was not matched by any enthusiasm for violence . Poujadist demonstrations were remarkable for their passivity , all the more remarkable when it is remembered that most Poujadist supporters had access to hunting rifles , if not Maquis sten guns . In spite of his attachment to French Algeria Poujade refused to join the general 's putsch against decolonisation in 1961 . Men whose youths had been taken up by the Second World War , and whose father 's lives had been blighted by the even greater horrors of Verdun and the Somme did not regard armed conflict as something to he undertaken lightly . Poujade was willing to see soldiers die to protect the homes and lives of French citizens , but , unlike Thatcher , he did not support military adventures in far away places undertaken to obtain prestige or influence or to uphold ' international law ' : he vigorously denounced French participation in the Suez expedition . <p> It might be argued that emphasis on the material aims and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two shared a certain cultural tone ? Both Poujade and Thatcher have had conspicuously bad relations with intellectuals . The literary critic , Roland Barthes , wrote a celebrated essay in which he argued that the key to Poujadism was its hatred of intellectuals ; while Margaret Thatcher has earned the hostility of the resident MAs of Oxford University . <p> However , there is an important difference between the ' anti-intellectualism ' of Poujade and Thatcher . Thatcher began her career as an industrial chemist and her anti-intellectualism was directed against disciplines with no obvious application like history , sociology and philosophy . Poujade , who started working life as a bookseller , was not hostile to literary culture : his speeches were studded with the historical references imbued into French children at primary school . His hostility was for the technocracy of scientific and economic experts who are so powerful in modern France . Poujade 's critique of modernity was rooted in feeling for small towns , gentle change and the beauty of the French countryside ; a world remote from the Barret homes , motorways , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thatcher have in common is not their attitude to intellectuals but intellectuals ' attitude to them . The reasons for this are not hard to understand . Academic historians and sociologists have always devoted far less attention to the lower middle class than to those social groups above it and below it , and the term petit-bourgeois is , in the mouths of most intellectuals , a by-word for philistinism and vulgarity . Perhaps such disdain is rooted in the fact that so many intellectuals themselves originate from the lower middle class , especially in England where the Butler Education Act and the Robbins report smoothed the path of a generation of upwardly mobile academics . Would it be too fanciful to suggest that the casual and inaccurate parallels drawn between two such different products of the lower middle class as Thatcher and Poujade are partly a result of many intellectuals ' disdain for their own origins ? <p> PHOTO : Driving back the frontiers of Socialism ?
