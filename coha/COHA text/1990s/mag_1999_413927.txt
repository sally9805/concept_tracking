New Guidelines : Preventing Stroke When is surgery warrented ? <p> An artery-clearing surgery to prevent stroke should only be used in certain circumstances , new research shows . The technique , called carotid endarterectomy , is commonly performed after a mild stroke or transient ischemic attack ( mini-stroke ) . But in a study of 2,885 patients presented at an American Heart Association conference last February in Orlando , FL , researchers found that although the surgery can be lifesaving , in certain cases it can actually trigger a stroke . Anyone considering having a carotid endarterectomy should follow these guidelines , says Richard Hughes , MD , chief of neurology at the Denver Health Medical Center : <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Stroke blocker ; Sometimes exercise works better than surgery . <p> Surgery is a primary option if your carotid arteries are at least 70% blocked . The study shows that in patients with blockages this severe , the operation reduced the risk of stroke or death by roughly 65% over two years . <p> Look for alternatives if your carotid arteries are less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery appears to be more dangerous than living with the blockages , " says Dr. Hughes . <p> You can reduce your stroke risk significantly by exercising regularly , eating healthy foods , losing weight , giving up smoking , and taking the proper medication , he explains . <p> Weigh surgery against other options if your arteries are blocked between 50 and 69% . Surgery may be worth it , but you 'll want to discuss all options with your doctor , says Dr. Hughes . Jordan Matus <p> Dodging Diabetes : Easy Really Does It New study : Mild exercise helps <p> The good news : Most Prevention readers already know that exercise makes you less vulnerable to diabetes . But research funded by the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , MD , has recently shown that even mild activity , such as casual walking , can lower your risk . The study of 1,467 people found that the more that people engaged in any form of exercise , the less likely they were to be insulin-resistant , a risk factor for diabetes . " Any exercise at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayer-Davis , PhD , an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of South Carolina in Columbia and lead study author . <p> Why exercise works : Walking and other activities improve insulin sensitivity-your body 's ability to use insulin to metabolize food-partly because the activity helps you shed excess weight . <p> How much do you need ? " The more exercise , the better , " suggests Dr. Mayer-Davis . But the big news here is that any exercise you 're capable of doing will help . Taking a half-hour walk several times a week is a good goal , she says , but short bouts of activity during the course of your day ( strolling through the park and taking the stairs rather than the elevator ) can also make a positive difference . Jordan Matus <p> Enjoy Milk Again Become lactose tolerant <p> About one in four people in the US has trouble digesting lactose , a sugar found in dairy products . That can make it difficult to get enough calcium in their diets . <p> But researchers at Purdue University in West Lafayette , IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colon to boost production of an enzyme that digests milk sugar . Result : People can consume up to 70 grams of lactose a day-the amount found in six cups of milk-without digestive problems . Here 's how it works : <p> Start out drinking 1/4 to 1/2 cup of milk with breakfast , lunch , and/or dinner . " It 's important to drink the milk as part of a meal , " says Dennis Savaiano , PhD , who helped devise the program . " That in itself lets you tolerate three times more lactose than if you drink it on an empty stomach . <p> " Gradually increase the amount over the next few weeks until you 're up to a full cup with each meal . <p> Eat yogurt for extra calcium either between meals or as part of a meal . It 's easier to digest than milk because its lactose is broken down by bacteria in the yogurt . <p> To prevent osteoporosis , women over 50 should shoot for at least 1,500 mg of calcium a day . Gale Maleskey <p> Bimonthly Aspirin Booster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day has been shown to be a simple , inexpensive way to stave off a heart attack or stroke . But studies also show that this does n't work for everyone . Now experts know why that is and how to extend aspirin 's protective power . <p> Big fix : Adding extra aspirin in the form of a larger dose twice a month seems to make a difference . <p> " Our study suggests that an aspirin ' booster ' can make the therapy more effective , " says Aaron Marcus , MD , chief of hematology and medical oncology at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center and professor at Cornell University Medical College , both in New York City . <p> As Dr. Marcus explains , aspirin reduces heart disease risk by keeping blood components ( platelets ) from clumping and contributing to clots in the heart or brain . But red blood cells can release substances that make platelets clump anyway . " This may explain why many people do n't respond well to aspirin therapy , " he says . <p> A little extra helps : In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that in two-thirds of the group , daily aspirin therapy was n't enough to keep the platelets from clumping ( Circulation , Feb 1998 ) . <p> To compensate for this , Dr. Marcus recommends taking one booster dose of 325 milligrams ( mg ) of aspirin ( the amount in one adult tablet ) every two weeks instead of the lower daily dose ( typically 81 mg , or one baby aspirin ) . <p> Should you try it ? If your doctor has put you on aspirin therapy , it 's probably worth talking to him about this . Some physicians may need more clinical trials to be convinced , says Dr. Marcus , but he adds : " I 'm now giving my patients the booster dose . " Julia VanTine <p> Healthy Kids : Dangers in Backyard Bouncing Trampoline injuries reach epidemic proportions <p> Got a trampoline ? Get rid of it . These playthings are bouncing kids right into the emergency room , concludes a new study that recommends their sale for private use be banned . <p> From 1990 to 1995 , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trampoline related injuries rose 98% , from 29,600 to 58,400 , with an average of 41,600 injuries per year ( Pediatrics , Mar 1998 ) . <p> " This is an epidemic . If trampoline injuries were an infectious disease , they would make headlines , " says study author Gary Smith , MD , DrPH , director of emergency medicine at Children 's Hospital in Columbus , OH , and assistant professor of pediatrics at the Ohio State University College of Medicine in Columbus . <p> What if the kids are supervised ? " Parents think , ' I 'll watch my child . I 'll follow the safety instructions . ' But parents simply ca n't react quickly enough to prevent injury , " says Dr. Smith . In fact , most trampoline injuries occur in the presence of a parent . <p> Kids just do n't have the motor skills , judgment , coordination , or strength to use a trampoline safely . " It takes only one landing at the wrong angle to cause an injury , " says Dr. Smith . " About 70% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from falls off the trampoline . " <p> Do n't buy a trampoline , or get rid of the one you have , says Dr. Smith . " There is no safe way to use a trampoline in a backyard setting , " he says . Julia VanTine <p> Shades that save your sight <p> Sunglasses are as necessary for your eyes as sunblock is for your skin . They can protect you from cataracts , macular degeneration , and other eye disorders . We asked Jeffrey L. Weaver , OD , director of the clinical care center of the American Optometric Association in St. Louis , how to select shades that fit the bill . His advice : Buy a pair that ... blocks 75 to 90% of visible light and 99% or more of ultraviolet ( UV ) rays . This information should be on the label . has gray lenses or as close as you can get . Other tints may be stylish , but they can distort the colors of traffic lights or signs if worn while driving . has large lenses . They should be big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see much light coming in around the sides of the lenses . contains polycarbonate , which provides shatter resistance . has the AOA seal . The American Optometric Association Seal of Acceptance means the sunglasses meet these guidelines and then some . ( A hefty price tag is no guarantee . ) <p> For extra protection , wear a brimmed hat or sit under an umbrella instead of directly in the sun . Jenny Lynch <p> The Latest on Lyme Disease Sort out the signs <p> If you think you 've been exposed to Lyme disease ( it 's transmitted by the bite of an infected black-legged tick or a deer tick ) , be alert for these symptoms : <p> Rash . The most distinctive sign is an area of redness around the site of a tick bite that expands slowly over a period of weeks and becomes partially clear in the center . In such a case , the American College of Physicians recommends treatment with antibiotics . <p> Swollen joint(s) . This may or may not be caused by Lyme disease . ( If it is , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your doctor can order lab tests to help diagnose the problem . <p> Muscle or joint ache(s) , fatigue , fever , headache . If no other symptoms develop , chances are Lyme disease is n't to blame , but check with your doctor . She may decide to treat the symptoms before giving you antibiotics , especially since the lab tests have a high rate of false-positive results . Protect Yourself <p> The best way to prevent Lyme disease is personal protection , says Allen C. Steere , MD , director of the Lyme Disease Program , Tufts-New England Medical Center in Boston . <p> Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants outdoors where the disease is prevalent . ( Check with your local department of health or your park or extension services . ) <p> Clear away brush , leaves , and grass from around your house . This low vegetation is the perfect home for ticks , as well as small animals on which ticks feed . <p> Use insect repellent . Check the label to be sure it works on ticks . Follow the instructions carefully . Rick Chillot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beat hypertension at any age and any stage <p> Success story : Researchers at Tulane University in New Orleans found that half of the 875 people they studied were able to stop taking blood pressure medication with no adverse effects by losing a modest 7.7 pounds and reducing their sodium intake by just 25% . And about a third of those people who only lost weight , or only cut back on salt , were also able to stop taking their medication ( Journal of the American Medical Association , Mar 1998 ) . <p> Second chance : This study of 60 to 80 year olds confirms that " no matter what has happened to you in the preceding six decades , no matter how badly you may have mistreated your body , you can still turn high blood pressure around , " says Paul Whelton , MD , the study 's main researcher . <p> How to do it : Work with your doctor to reduce your blood pressure medications safely , Dr. Whelton says . The key steps : <p> Add half an hour or so of easy exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your diet and pare excess calories . <p> Find out where the salt in your diet 's coming from by reading labels on processed foods . Substitute lower-salt versions . <p> No matter how you 've mistreated your body , you can still turn high blood pressure around .
