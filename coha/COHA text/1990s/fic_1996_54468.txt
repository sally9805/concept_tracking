Nine years old . Brother and sister . More than that . Somehow , on an atomic or subatomic level , unaffected by the differences in hair color ( his was ruddy , hers streaky blonde ) and size ( she had two inches and five pounds on him ) and sex , they were identical twins . <p> At least that 's what they felt , and that 's what they told everyone . Young children and dumber adults  --  those who did n't understand the difference between mono- and dizygotic twinning  --  even believed them . They certainly acted alike , thought alike , talked alike . <p> They did n't have to consult one another , or rely on a psychic bond , to dress alike . lust dip into the shirt drawer and drag out one of eight identical  --  except for distinguishing stains  --  red-and-white striped shirts .

She 'd given up years before . Even grandparents , faced with the waste of unworn choices , bowed to them with red-and-white striped shirts , Wrangler jeans . Or , more frequently , small gifts of money . <p> They 'd heard ( overheard ) many discussions on the possible causes of their bond . Their names ? Madeleine and Matthew , Maddy and Matt for short . The fact that their mother used to dress them alike and call them " the twins " ? The tiny apartment that insisted even at the advanced age of nine they share a room ? Bunk beds , one dresser , hardly enough room to spin around . <p> They were identical twins , all right . An unsplittable atom , an uncuttable string , alike in every way that mattered . <p> Such as curiosity . <p> When the old woman across the street came out feet first  --  slowly , no hurry  --  on a stretcher , they were hiding in the hedge along her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the sheet when the paramedics bumped their load down the steps . They tried the door after the ambulance putted away , just in case . If one of them had the idea , the other reached for the doorknob , blended , tangled together . Years later , neither of them would ever be able to remember an individual part in the event . They opened the door . They entered the dead woman 's house . <p> They found the stacks of Harlequin romances , the empty boxes from Domino 's pizza , the dead cat . <p> It had been arranged on a filthy silk pillow near the fireplace , eyes open a slit , ribs defined through the tabby fur , legs like sticks . " Poor things " they said , in the same breath , kneeling down near  --  but not touching m the desiccated corpse . " Poor little thing . " <p> They decided , eyes brimming over , that such a thing would not be allowed to happen again . They would see to that , looking through windows , spying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hints of insanity , cruelty , or imminent death . And then , just to be sure they could get in and remedy any future problems , they swiped the key to the back garage door from a keyring in the kitchen . Just one key , not the whole bunch , nothing anyone would notice . <p> Just one key . Not two halves , not something that could be divided so the two parts that made them could each carry some . One key . Maddy stuck it in her pocket . Then they were gone , running through " their " door in the garage . Except Maddy had to stop and lock it behind her . Matt squeezed through the hedge first , waited on the other side , hissing for her to hurry . <p> For a while , they took turns carrying the key . After all , identical pockets , right ? A professional cleaning crew spent a couple days in the house . The two of them , watching from the hedge again , wondered which of the many garbage bags held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each thinking the other had the key . It went through the wash in Matt 's jean pocket . <p> Actually in Maddy 's , for that was one of the days he had worn her ieans . The next time she put them on , poking her hands down into the pockets to flatten and smooth them out , the key scraped her skin . That was it , she decided , closing her fingers around the bit of metal . She was going to be in charge of the key from now on . It could have fallen out in the wash . Their mother could have found it . <p> Matt did n't care . As long as one of them had it , he told her , it did n't matter which one did . By that time , a " For Sale " sign stood in the front yard of the house across the street . People toured the house under the gushing attention of a woman in a pukey gold jacket  --  and the watchful eyes of two hidden children in red-and-white shirts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play jacks or hopscotch ( detestable games ) on the sidewalk in front of their apartment building , making random moves while they scanned the potential purchasers . <p> " Yuck , " they breathed to one another . Two men wearing business attire and carrying their own personal copies of The Wall Street Journal . ) <p> " Gross . " ( A couple with a new baby in a reeking diaper  --  by the time they left the house , a rim of brown was oozing out one leghole . ) <p> " All right . " ( A family with a kid about their age . ) <p> But none of those people bought the house . Three different sets of potential buyers had inspected the house land been inspected by them ) the day the gold jacket woman put " Sold " on the sign , so Maddy and Matt did n't know who the buyer was until the woman started moving in . <p> She had n't been anywhere near their first choice , but she was far from the most hideous of the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could see . " Drat , " Maddy whispered . " Now who are we going to protect ? " The key felt dull and heavy in her pocket . <p> The woman wore bright colors that did n't necessarily go together , but somehow seemed right . Or almost right . " Maybe she 's kind of crazy , " Matt said , a hopeful note in his voice . " Maybe we 'll have to keep an eye on her . She looks kind of weird . " <p> Maddy shrugged . In green sweatpants , a brilliant purple shirt , and yellow socks  --  even glittery shoelaces in her black running shoes  --  the woman did look strange . But not crazy . <p> They were using the jump-rope disguise that day , standing side by side on their sidewalk , jumping in tandem , facing in the direction of the house and the woman and the moving van . The movers were talking about them , they could tell from the way the men looked over their shoulders and laughed . The woman smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , in between directing men with boxes and chairs and other pieces of furniture . <p> They had decided , earlier that morning , not to be too friendly right away . So they did n't smile back , although Maddy felt as if she might like to . She thought the woman looked interesting , even if you ignored her clothes . For one thing , her hair was the exact color of butterscotch pudding , pulled into a skinny braid that dribbled down the back of her purple shirt . For another , she had a really wide mouth that seemed to naturally fall into at least half a smile . Was her hair really that color , Maddy wondered , or did she dye it ? It would be interesting to meet a grownup who wanted to have hair that looked like butterscotch . It was such a delicious color . <p> She was so intent on the woman that she did n't notice Matt had stopped jumping until he grabbed her rope and made her trip . " Ow , " she said . " Quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Let 's do something else . " <p> Maddy let him talk her into the park , with the promise that they 'd watch again in the afternoon . <p> For several weeks , they conducted surveillance . They noticed when the woman rode her bike off in the mornings  --  for work , they assumed  --  and when she returned . They looked in every window of the house . Particularly the window in the back of the garage . <p> Through it , they Could see that the woman had no car , that the garage looked messy but not dirty , that there was a flashlight on the workbench near the door . <p> The first night they ' had planned on inspecting the garage , nothing seemed to go right . First , their mother stayed up late watching some movie . Maddy fell asleep waiting for the TV sounds to stop . She was dreaming that they were approaching the garage when Matt shook her awake . She socked him blindly . " Sorry , " she muttered , when she realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> There was another scare , too , as they eased the front door of the apartment building open . Someone was crouched in the middle of the street , in spite of the hour . Matt pulled the door closed again , holding the knob and turning it to avoid even a click . Then they ran back upstairs , only semi-quietly , back into their own apartment . They made their way to the living room window on hands and knees and peered over the sill at the street below . <p> Although the butterscotch hair was bleached into a neutral color by the street lights , they recognized the woman . She held a paint brash and a shiny can , and she was going over the faded yellow lines in the center of the street with a smooth motion , covering them with new , slick yellow . Crouch , paint , step to the next line . They watched her until she was out of their view , still painting , and then they went back to bed . <p> The next day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should do it right away ; Matt wanted to wait , to spy some more first , to see what else she was up to . " She 's done painting , " Maddy pointed out . " And anyway , she 's probably tired from staying up so late last night . She 'll go to bed early tonight . " <p> " Yeah , maybe , " said Matt . He looked a little tired himself . <p> " Scared ? " teased Maddy . <p> He flashed her a dirty look , but he did n't argue anymore . <p> They pretended they were asleep when their mother came in to kiss them that night . Maddy heard her whisper , " Good night , love , " to Matt , up on the top bunk . She waited , eyes lightly closed , in the cave created by Matt 's bed . Feathery touch of her mother 's fingers on her cheek . " Good night , sweetie . " Light kiss . Blanket adjusted under her chin . Maddy had to fight to keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the door closed . They were alone . <p> Scritch of springs above her as Matt changed positions . " Good night , sweetie , " he whispered , in a mock falsetto . " Good night , love , " she returned , almost reluctantly . It was n't really a joke , after all , that their mother loved them . <p> Matt 's legs  --  still in jeans  --  appeared over the edge of the bunk . He quietly twisted around and lowered himself to the floor , avoiding the creaky ladder . Maddy sat up , letting the blanket fall away from her striped shirt . " We 'd better wait a little while , " she murmured . <p> They sat , side by side , on Maddy 's bed , listening to the sounds of water running in the bathroom , the toilet flushing , the muffled tones of the newscaster from their mother 's bedside clock/radio . Then silence . <p> They waited still , as the silence in their apartment grew until it had encompassed the building , the street . Nodding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door with the silence peculiar to kids in black canvas Keds , each step quieter than the last , their black shoes invisible , inaudible in the night . <p> Maddy stopped in the doorway and slid one hand into a pocket , even though she knew the key would be there . Then she went on , one step behind her twin , past furniture that revealed its weariness even to the curtain-muffled street lights . <p> Outside , they dashed across the street and melted into the hedge . They had never been in the hedge during the night before . Blackened twigs caught at their shirts , the skin of their arms , their hair . The woman 's house was dark . " Let 's go in now , " said Matt , in a voice no louder than a branch reaching for its neighbor . <p> Maddy nodded and broke from the hedge , dashing for the deep shadow at the side of the garage . When Matt joined her , breathing more deeply than the short distance warranted , they sidled along the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she half expected someone to be waiting for them around the comer , the woman or a psycho killer or something not even human , made of darkness . " Go on , " hissed Matt , poking her in the back . She stumbled forward , into the empty back yard . " Unlock the door , " he said . <p> She pulled the key from her pocket and inserted it into the dark slit in the knob . <p> The key did n't make a sound , and neither did the doorknob . Maddy felt the door give to her slight pressure . She let the knob move back to its original position and pushed the door slowly open . <p> The threshold was the worst part , with the shadowy yard behind them and the dark garage , open like a mouth , before . They both stood for a moment . Then Matt reached past her , clutching her arm with his other hand , and grabbed the flashlight from the workbench . <p> The pale circle of light made the decision for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing the door behind them . <p> Matt swept the light slowly around , keeping it below the level of the window . Objects came into existence , disappeared . A bicycle helmet , a muddy garden trowel , a half-empty bag of potting soil , shiny cans with dribbles of color . " Stop , " said Maddy , when the light traveled past the cans , and illuminated a pair of snow shoes . " That must be what she was painting the street with . " <p> Matt swung the light back to the cans , then played it on the garage floor , creating a path to the shelves that held the cans . They stepped over patches of ancient oil , splotches of brilliant paint . <p> The cans had hand-lettered labels . Permanent Day-Glow Pink . Permanent White . Permanent Highway Department Yellow . And a larger can , dented and scratched , with dried trickles of a clear substance down its sides . That one bore just one word on its label : Base . " It 's just paint , " said Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the night ? " asked Maddy . " Let 's open one of them up . " She picked up Permanent Day-Glow Pink and gave it a shake . <p> Matt positioned the flashlight so its beam illuminated a triangle of shelf . He took a screwdriver from an empty chili can and started prying the lid off the can Maddy had chosen . <p> The can had obviously not been opened in a while . " Here , " said Maddy . " Let me try . " She grabbed the screwdriver from Matt 's hand . With all her strength , she levered the tip at the edge of the can . <p> The lid flew off amid a spatter of pink droplets . It hit Matt 's cheek with a liquid plop , clung for a second , and slid down onto his shirt . <p> Matt let out half a shriek , which he quickly stifled . Maddy caught the lid in mid-air , before it could clatter to the concrete floor . " Ssshhh , " she said , slapping the lid down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They stood there , holding their breaths and listening . Silence . Silence . But then , just as they released the trapped air and let their shoulders drop , footsteps . <p> Maddy reached out one finger and hit the button on the flashlight . Her last sight before the world disappeared was Matt 's face , not comic in spite of the circle of bright pink covering one cheek . <p> Step . Silence . Step . They reached out to each other and sank into a crouch , not daring to move in the darkness . Before their eyes had a chance to adjust , the door from the house opened , letting a rectangle of light spill into the garage . Maddy saw a hand reach into the garage and flick a switch upward . <p> Afterward , she could never remember if she , or Matt  --  or both of them  --  had screamed or if there had been only a dreadful silence as the woman discovered them . <p> " What are you doing here ? " demanded the woman . " How did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Matt looked over his shoulder at the woman , and the woman let out a shriek that could have been the unvoiced half of his own . " Shit ! What have you done ? " <p> She ran toward them on bare feet and grabbed Matt 's chin , pulling him into a standing position . Maddy followed him up . " Shit , shit , shit , " said the woman . " You little idiots . " <p> Tears leaked out of her light brown eyes . She gave Matt 's chin a shake and released it , swiping her arm across her own face . <p> The tears scared Maddy more than anything . Paint was n't a tragedy  --  was it ? Matt looked as if he were about to start crying . He would hate that , she knew . " We can wash it off , " she said , voice wobbling . <p> " No . " <p> " We 'll do it at home then , " she said , angry now . " Come on , Matt . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " said the woman again , grabbing Matt 's other arm , stopping their progress . " I did n't mean ' no , you ca n't use my sink . ' " She glared at them . " I meant ' no , it is not possible for you to physically remove that paint . ' It 's permanent . As in forever . " She dropped Matt 's arm . <p> They just stood there . Matt reached two fingers up to his cheek - slowly . " Hey , " he said , " it feels okay . " <p> Maddy touched the painted skin of her brother 's cheek and felt normal skin . " What 's going on ? " she whispered . <p> The woman gulped in some air . " It 's permanent paint , " she said . " Does n't wash off , no solvent  --  it just becomes part of whatever it touches . " She , too , reached out to Matt 's cheek . <p> Matt whipped his head away . " Leave me alone , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , the one they 'd practiced in the bathroom mirror until they had the identical furl of eyebrow , clench of jaw . <p> The woman backed up a step . " Fine , " she said . " Did I ask you to break into my garage and mess with something you had no business with ? " She spun around and headed back toward the door . <p> Maddy 's bravado faltered . What if they could n't get it off themselves . " Please , " she said . " You have to help . " <p> For a moment , she was n't sure if the woman was going to stop . Then she did , her back stiff beneath its straggle of butterscotch hair . " Please , " Matt said . <p> Washing  --  as predicted  --  accomplished nothing . Maddy , snooping through an open cabinet in the bathroom , said , " What about this ? " She held out an old jar of foundation . <p> " I 'm not wearing makeup , " Matt said , from his perch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You 'd rather look like a clown ? " Maddy asked . <p> The woman grabbed the jar from her and swabbed a dab on Matt 's cheek while they were arguing . " Hold still or I 'll get some in your eye , " she told him . She smeared it around on the pink circle . " Better , " she said , sighing , " but still not good . " The pink glowed from beneath the coating of tan . " Besides , I kind of doubt that makeup would last more than a couple minutes on a boy . You 'd need something a little more . . . . " Her voice trailed off . <p> Maddy and Matt looked up at her , waiting for the sentence to finish . Instead , she stood up and ran from the bathroom . " Come on , " she yelled from the kitchen . The door into the garage banged . <p> When they got out there , she was pouring base into a new shiny can . " Come here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She grabbed his face between her hands and stared closely at it , paying particular attention to the unpainted cheek . Then she started dripping colors from vials into the base , stirring with a dowel . Every once in a while , she held the dowel up next to Matt 's cheek , comparing the glistening painted wood to the color of his skin . <p> The first few times she did this , she said nothing , just grunted and added some more color to the mixture . Maddy could hardly breathe . It had to work . Anything was better than that pink . Finally , the woman judged the match and said , " Almost . " <p> Maddy jumped up to look . She narrowed her eyes . " Maybe , " she said doubtfully . <p> " Well , " snapped the woman , " it 's not going to be exact . And it 's hard to tell when the paint is wet and shiny . It wo n't dry like this . " <p> " It just looks more like a doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not like a real person . " <p> The woman tilted her head , considering . " You 're right , " she said . " What we have here is Permanent Doll Face . What we need is Permanent Natural Boy . So what makes a boy different from a doll ? " <p> " Dirt , " said Maddy . Matt kicked her . " Sweat . " <p> " Dirt I can manage , " said the woman , sending a shower of dust from the edge of a shelf into the paint . " Sweat you 'll have to add yourself . " She held up the dowel near Matt 's face again . <p> It was still slick and shiny , but somehow Maddy could tell it was the right color  --  or as close to right as anyone was going to get . " Yes , " she said . <p> " Close your eyes , " the woman told Matt , picking up a small paintbrush . He drew back a little . " You 'd rather go around like you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He squinched his eyes shut , as much , Maddy guessed , to control a suspicious glimmer of tears , as because he 'd been told to . <p> The woman dipped the brush into the paint and swirled it around . The paint glimmered . Maddy felt her insides compress into tight balls . It had to work . It just had to . The woman stroked the brush over Matt 's painted cheek , covering the Permanent Day-Glow Pink with Permanent Natural Boy . A few tears squeezed out of Matt 's eyes and mingled with the paint . " Quit crying  --  I do n't know what effect it will have on the paint . " <p> He stopped , his jaw quivering . The woman finished covering the splotch and stood back . " You know , " she said , " it 's not going to match the other cheek perfectly . " And before Matt could say anything , she reached out with the brush and began painting his other cheek . <p> Maddy yelped . Matt did n't move . And it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose did n't match . . . . <p> In the end , she painted his whole face , even the eyelids . Maddy held his hair back while his forehead dried . Her face felt numb , as if it had been painted . Would their mother notice ? Would they get in trouble ? <p> When she could let his hair fall against his forehead and look at him from a little distance , she knew that their mother would not notice . No one would , except her . Matt ran into the house to look in the bathroom mirror . Maddy brushed one hand against her eyes . <p> The woman grabbed her wrist , turned the hand palm upward . " Look , " she said . <p> Bright pink smudged the tips of three fingers . From when she 'd caught the lid , Maddy guessed . <p> " So what do you want ? " the woman asked , cocking her head toward the cans . " Day-Glow Pink or Permanent Natural Boy ? " <p> Maddy pointed one of the offended fingers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brush , the woman touched up her fingers , covering the pink and then stroking down and painting the palm of Maddy 's right hand so it would be uniform . " Do you want me to do the other hand ? " she asked . " It 's probably not that big of a deal . Your hands wo n't always be side by side , not like your brother 's cheeks . " <p> " Can you do my face ? " Maddy asked . <p> The woman hesitated , shook her head . " I do n't think that would be a good idea , " she said . " Your skin color is n't quite the same as your brother 's . " <p> Maddy wanted to say , " but we 're identical twins , " but the words glued themselves to the roof of her mouth . <p> Matt bounded into the garage . " Hey , thanks , " he said . <p> The woman nodded soberly . " You 're welcome . Now , please  --  " her voice tightened " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " But where did you get the paints ? " Maddy asked . " And how can they last forever ? Who makes them ? " Now that the crisis was taken care of , she was consumed with curiosity . <p> " It 's none of your business , " the woman said flatly . <p> " It is too , " said Maddy . She pointed at Matt 's face . " How do we know what that will do to him ? " <p> Matt turned pale beneath his coat of paint . " This wo n't hurt me , will it ? " <p> The woman hissed something that was probably a swear word . " Okay . It 's a special type of paint . It wo n't hurt you . You ca n't buy it in stores . It  --  " <p> " Then where do you get it ? " Maddy asked again . <p> " Do n't interrupt me , " the woman snapped . " I have a friend , an ... inventor . He makes it . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Matt asked . " He 'd get rich . " <p> " It 's complicated , " the woman said . " You could n't make the paints in factories . And even if you could , would you want just anybody to have access to them ? Vandals ? Gang members ? Little kids ? " She looked pointedly at them . <p> Maddy flushed . " We 're sorry , " she muttered . " We did n't know . " <p> " Fine . You did n't know and you still got into trouble . What if you h.ad known ? What if you were the type of people who painted swastikas and swear words on the windows of a Jewish family ? Horrible things that could n't be scraped off . " <p> Matt opened his mouth again . " Yeah , but  --  " <p> " Enough , " the woman said . " Just get out of here . " <p> The two of them headed for the door . " Is your hair really that color ? " Maddy blurted out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " <p> " I painted it , " said the woman . She gave Maddy half a smile . <p> Matt was gone by now , into the darkness . " I thought so , " said Maddy . She walked through the door , closing it behind her . The key protruded from the knob ; Maddy slipped it into her pocket . <p> " Hey , Maddy , " her brother called quietly from around the comer , " did you get the key ? " <p> She rested her painted hand over her pocket for a moment . " No , " she whispered back , " she must have taken it . " <p> " Rats . Race you to the house . " <p> They plunged off through the shadows along the hedge , darted across the street . Maddy touched the door first , with her right hand . Then she opened it , and they sneaked to their room . <p> The woman 's brief , incomplete explanation was not enough . They still spent time in the hedges and trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still cased the house , peering through the windows , even taking an occasional instant picture if their morn left the Polaroid camera lying around . <p> They saw her bike away with an empty backpack and return with one that looked bulgy and heavy . They saw her painting in the midnight street again . They went through her garbage and found letters from a man who informed her he was improving the base and had developed a color called " Permanent Concrete Gray " that seemed to repel graffiti . There was no return address on the envelopes . At times , Maddy was tempted to confess that she still had the key , but to do that she would have had to admit that she 'd lied about it before . So they stayed on the outside , doing plenty of looking in . <p> She did go back to the garage once , a year later , when Matt had been invited to a birthday party and she had n't . That had happened before , but they 'd always wangled an invitation for the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keds , it was just going to be guys . <p> The garage looked different in the afternoon , with dusty light filtering through the window . The woman 's bike and helmet were gone . Maddy headed straight for the paint cans and picked up Permanent Natural Boy . She tilted it back and forth , guessing how much was left . Quite a bit , she thought . <p> She set the can on the shelf and compared the palms of her hands . Different , but not much . Her right hand was no dirtier than her left , but the dirt looked more integral , more a part of the hand , more that it was supposed to be that way . Some of the dirt was from her bike , she knew , or from climbing the fence in back of the apartment , but some of it was painted on . Never-come-offable . Permanent . <p> She touched the lid of the can with one finger . Then she left it on the shelf , not exactly where she had found it . She almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she put it back in her pocket . That was around the time they stopped wearing the red-and-white shirts . One of the last seamless , shared decisions . <p> When they grew up , people never mistook them for identical twins  --  or for twins at all . They always assumed Matt was younger by a year or three . One of his women friends confided to Maddy that he looked like a little boy who 'd forgotten to wash his face  --  or maybe he had , but he had n't done a very good job . A little boy who still knew how to cry when he got hurt . <p> Maddy gave a neutral smile , one she 'd practiced alone in the mirror . She rubbed the palms of her hands together , feeling the sameness beneath the difference . " Yeah , he 's just a big kid , " she said . " Are n't we all .
