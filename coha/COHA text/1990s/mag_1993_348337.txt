EXHIBIT : JEFF KOONS <P> WHERE : SAN FRANCISCO MUSEUM OF MODERN ART <P> WHAT : MIXED-MEDIA SCULPTURES AND WALL PIECES <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : Koons adds a depressing footnote to Pop art with his self- promoting devotion to gloss and glitz . <P> The Jeff Koons exhibition on view at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art until next week  --  it goes to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in July  --  is a fairly grim spectacle . It is , so to speak , a consomme double of cliche : first because the work is more kitschy than kitsch , and second because it has been so often reproduced and discussed by a sensation-hungry and ideology-obsessed art world that its shock value has gone flat . The first time you go into a gallery and see a 7-ft. - high toy bear in a striped T shirt inspecting the whistle of a London cop , all done in painted wood , faithful to the last hair , by some European souvenir manufacturer  --  Koons , who probably could n't carve well enough to do his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff himself  --  the effect is , well , fairly unsettling . The second time you see it , it 's just another Koons . The third time , boredom supervenes . <P> By now , Koons ' work is so overexposed that it loses nothing in reproduction and gains nothing in the original . It is pure stasis . Koons is the baby to Andy Warhol 's Rosemary . There is no artist in whom self-advertisement and self-esteem are more ecstatically united than Koons : he makes even Julian Schnabel , who recently proclaimed himself to be the nearest thing America has to Picasso , look like a paragon of self-effacement . He has done for narcissism what Michael Milken did for the junk bond . <P> Koons has , however , made a contribution to American culture in the form of comedy : the sight of so many critics , dealers and museum folk peering into the demitasse of his talent and declaring it an oracular well whose contents address issues , as the phrase goes , of class , race , money , sex , obscenity , beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . Clearly , we are in Madonnaland , where every publicity hound  --  oops , semiotician of mass culture  --  must have his day in the museum . <P> At the start of his career , about 14 years ago , the world was not ready for Koons . He made his first works , inflatable plastic flowers bought in a dime store and set in front of mirrors , without many people noticing . A second group of objects , vacuum cleaners displayed in highly lighted Plexiglas cases , failed at first to excite the indifferent collectors . How could this be ? " I 've always loved sales , " Koons remarks in the catalog , " and to me , being a salesman is being very generous to the public because you 're meeting the needs of the people .
