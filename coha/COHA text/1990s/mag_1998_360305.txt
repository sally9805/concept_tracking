If there had been a TV show Andrew Johnson : Presidency in Crisis , New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley would have been the star . Greeley , king of the pro-impeachment sound bite , called Johnson " an aching tooth in the national jaw , a screeching infant in a crowded lecture room , " and said , " There can be no peace or comfort till he is out . " And plenty of Congressmen would happily have offered up the 19th century version of talk-show rant . One Republican Representative denounced Johnson as " an ungrateful , despicable , besotted traitorous man  --  an incubus . " Be grateful , Bill Clinton . <P> Political character assassination was alive and well long before cable TV and the Internet . Forget Vince Foster conspiracy theories  --  1860s Republicans charged that Johnson , when he was Vice President , aided in Abraham Lincoln 's assassination so he could move up to the top job . Monica Lewinsky pales beside Jennie Perry , who blackmailed Johnson with charges that he fathered an illegitimate son . And Johnson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise again . If Clinton were to channel Johnson , the two men  --  each born in poverty in the South , raised by a widow , elected Governor before he became President and tormented by Republican foes  --  would have a lot to talk about . The drive to impeach Johnson , the only President to be impeached and tried in the Senate , was really about the politics of post-Civil War Reconstruction . The Radical Republicans who controlled Congress took a hard line toward Dixie . Johnson was no Confederate ; he was the only Southern Congressman not to secede when his state did . But he vetoed bills that he viewed as too punitive against former slave owners , and he resisted military rule over the Southern states . Republicans were so irate , said Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles , that they would have impeached Johnson " had he been accused of stepping on a dog 's tail . " <P> Technically , Johnson was impeached for firing his Secretary of War , Edwin Stanton , who was a Radical Republican sympathizer . Johnson 's enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law that was later judged to be unconstitutional . The legislators threw in a few other charges , including conspiracy and bringing Congress into disrepute . " A shaggy mountain of malice had panted , heaved and labored , " an early Johnson biographer fulminated , " and this small and very scaly mouse was the result ! " <P> If the charges against Johnson were weak , his defense was at times Clintonian . His lawyers argued he could not have " conspired " with Stanton 's successor because a Commander in Chief gives orders , which his subordinate has no choice but to accept . And they argued that the federal conspiracy law did not apply , because it covered only states and " territories , " and Washington was neither . Johnson tried to build popular support by launching a speaking tour  --  dubbed his " Swing Around the Circle "  --  but he was heckled in St. Louis , Mo. , and told by an Indianapolis , Ind. , mob to " shut up . " Like some of Clinton 's televised explaining and finger wagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
