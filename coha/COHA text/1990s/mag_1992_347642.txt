TITLE : THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE <P> AUTHOR : EDWARD O. WILSON <P> PUBLISHER : HARVARD UNIVERSITY ; 424 PAGES ; $29.95 <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : A leading biologist 's warning about ecological disaster is both top-drawer science and high-level art . <P> The world is coming to an end . Again . Edward O. Wilson , a pioneer of sociobiology and professor of entomology at Harvard 's Museum of Comparative Zoology , lists five earth-shattering events in the past half-billion years . The latest may have been a one-two punch . A meteorite six miles wide struck the Caribbean region 66 million years ago and set off intercontinental volcanic eruptions . The smoke and dust changed the global climate , killing countless plant and animal species . <P> Earlier mass extinctions , 440 million to 210 million years back , are attributed to the breakup and drift of the single supercontinent known as Pangaea . All these cataclysms , says Wilson , drastically reduced the variety of species . But given world enough and time ( at least 20 million years ) , biological diversity reasserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sapiens does not have the luxury of such a leisurely recovery . Nor does it deserve it , because it is now the leading threat to life-forms , including itself . What Darwin called the tangled bank and Wilson calls the web of life is a highly interdependent system . An event in one part of the web jiggles the whole . <P> Wilson has mastered his science and the art of teaching it . He moves easily from the macro to the micro , from the eruption of Krakatau to the silent messages of chromosomes . He strives for clarity , but never at the expense of complexity . An explanation of how species evolve may require more attention than Homo televideous is willing to muster . Hang in . Accounts of the author 's field experiences convey an excitement of discovery that many readers probably last felt as children examining insects in a patch of grass . <P> Much of Wilson 's expertise derives from his award-winning studies of life on islands where the number of species increases or decreases with the size of habitat . This finding is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large landmasses where biological diversity is rapidly losing out to development and pollution . Wilson estimates that 10,000 species are destroyed each year , a rate that is increasing as the world 's population grows toward 10 billion people by the middle of the next century . <P> So what , critics argue ? Evolution is littered with the remains of organisms that did n't make it , and prophecies of ecological doom have replaced nightmares of thermonuclear holocaust . The thinking animal is also the one that worries the most . It should . Wilson 's intellectual , aesthetic and moral conception of life on earth suggests that survival may depend on a new age of anxiety .
