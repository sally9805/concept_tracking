Were it not so faithful to its own artistic designs , you might suppose Tom Stoppard had written Arcadia expressly to refute his critics . Though having led something of a charmed professional life ( he has been internationally acclaimed since his first produced play , Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead , in 1967 ) , the Czechoslovak-born playwright has not been spared his detractors , particularly in his adopted England . <P> We 've been told Stoppard has no real subject but his own ingenuity . But with Arcadia he has taken on , dazzlingly , an expansive slew of topics : a young girl 's dawning sexuality , the birth of Romanticism , modern academia , post-Newtonian physics . We 've heard he fails to understand women or to create good female characters . But in Thomasina Coverly , a 13-year-old mathematical genius fated to die before her 17th birthday , he has forged a female role any young actress would pine for . We 've heard that he is all brain and no heart , and yet by Arcadia 's final act , Stoppard has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> As often happens with his plays , Arcadia  --  which opened on Broadway last week  --  is more complicated in the summarizing than in the performing ; the staging clarifies a great deal .

We observe a variety of events , most of them comical , unfolding in 1809 , and we see also how the haphazard by-products of those events  --  stray letters , drawings , jottings  --  are interpreted , shrewdly but often incorrectly , nearly two centuries later . The past proves inhospitable ; it resists the probings of the present . <P> But if Arcadia provides a cautionary fable for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose themes resound through the decades in transmuted , enriched forms . Stoppard has devised the perfect setting for his verbal ambiguity and punning , as when he plays on the phrase " the action of bodies in heat . " To Thomasina and her tutor Septimus Hodge , the words suggest the entropic universe of the second law of thermodynamics and the collapse of classical mathematics . But to Chloe Coverly , a distant descendant of Thomasina , those bodies are human and the heat is sexual . Words , no less than the house 's visitors , are constantly on the move .
