FLYING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS IN 1985 , three years before the Pan Am bombing , 248 American soldiers and eight crew members died when their chartered DC-8 jet plunged to earth just after taking off from a refueling stop in Gander , Newfoundland . It was the worst U.S. military air disaster ever . Icing of the wings was immediately suggested as the cause , although Islamic Jihad terrorists just as quickly boasted of blowing up the jet . <P> It was n't until 1989 that an Iran-contra connection to the tragedy was revealed . Arrow Air , the charter company , turned out to be one of Lieut . Colonel Oliver North 's regular arms shippers . Although most of the crash victims belonged to the U.S. 101st Airborne Division , returning from six months ' duty with the multinational peacekeeping force in the Sinai , more than 20 Special Forces personnel trained for counterterrorist missions were also on board . Suspicions have recently deepened that they , like Charles McKee and the members of his hostage-rescue team on Pan Am Flight 103 , were the target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments seemed determined to literally bury any evidence that might point to such a conclusion . Major General John Crosby , then the U.S. Army 's deputy chief of staff for personnel , arrived in Gander within hours of the tragedy . He was quoted by the Arrow Air maintenance chief as wanting to " bulldoze over the crash site immediately , " although Crosby has denied it . Just as quickly , White House spokesman Larry Speakes assured the world there was " no evidence of sabotage or an explosion in flight . " <P> In 1988 , after interminable foot dragging and infighting , the nine-member Canadian Aviation Safety Board issued a split verdict . Five attributed the crash to ice formation and not to an explosion . But four , including two aeronautical engineers , disagreed so vociferously that a former Canadian supreme court justice was appointed to see if a new investigation should be opened . The evidence , wrote Justice Willard Estey , " does not support ice contamination . " Nevertheless , he advised that further probing would be unfair to the victims ' families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be reopened , " counters George Baker , the Liberal Party Member of Parliament from Gander , who lives one mile ( 1.6 km ) from the crash site . <P> A new book titled Improbable Cause , written by Les Filotas , one of the dissenting air-safety board members , promises on its cover to expose the " deceit and dissent in the investigation . " Filotas does that with a devastating accumulation of evidence spanning 553 pages . " Many of the experts involved in the investigation , " says Filotas , " did n't realize they were participating in a cover-up . " <P> Even sharper accusations are being leveled by M. Gene Wheaton , the private investigator appointed by the Families for Truth about Gander , Inc . The organization was founded in 1989 by Dr. J.D. Phillips and his wife Zona of St. Petersburg , Florida . As father and stepmother of one of the victims , they charged the U.S. with " failing to conduct a full inquest , or even revealing the facts it does possess . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
