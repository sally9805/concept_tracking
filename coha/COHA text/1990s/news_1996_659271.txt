<p> Oliver Sutton woke up one spring morning and discovered that a half-million of his listeners had disappeared . <p> Not , however , without a trace . <p> The audience of WBLS-FM , the most important black-owned station in New York and perhaps the nation , had left for another flavor down the dial . <p> The new station played the " classic soul " of Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson - the music WBLS was built on . Its ubiquitous ads featured Barry White , Luther Vandross , Anita Baker - the artists WBLS had helped to stardom . <p> But this new mecca of urban radio belonged to a white , Indiana-based corporation . And where BLS prided itself on keeping an ear to the city 's streets , the new kid was getting over with market surveys , consultants ' advice and catchy promotions . <p> Within two months of its Jan. 1 , 1995 , launch , Emmis Broadcasting 's WRKS-FM ( KISS ) was New York 's No. 1 station . Its gain was primarily Sutton 's loss ; nearly one-third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad business . Some of the friends of Sutton 's family - including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and singers Ashford &; Simpson - jumped ship to the enemy . <p> The KISS assault was unprecedented - until it was repeated this spring . WKTU-FM , owned by Dallas-based Evergreen Media , traded country twang for disco 's thump-thump-thump and rode the beat to the top of the ratings . <p> Three of the city 's four black-oriented stations are now in Arbitron 's local top five : KISS ; its sister station , hip-hop haven WQHT-FM ( Hot-97 ) ; and the reinvented KTU . All are owned by white out-of-towners ; two have playlists drawn from BLS ' past . <p> Early this year , WBLS plunged to 16th on the Arbitron list . The freefall , says station manager Sutton , " sent us into shock . " <p> He knew that the station had gotten " fat and comfortable . " And he knew that there was only one man who could lead BLS back to the top . <p> WBLS is the flagship station of Inner City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sutton , probably the richest , most powerful black New Yorker . <p> Using Harlem 's voting bloc as his springboard , Sutton became Manhattan borough president and an even more influential political power broker . Jesse Jackson referred to Sutton as " the godfather , " and his support was key to Jackson 's presidential bid . Sutton lent Jackson thousands of dollars during the 1980s . <p> Smooth , conciliatory and shrewd , Sutton made millions in broadcasting . Jackson was among Inner City 's investors . <p> When WBLS debuted in 1973 , it was billed as " the total black experience . " Within five years , it became the city 's No. 1 station for the 18-to-34 crowd . It soon crossed over to white and Hispanic audiences . <p> The Suttons took their influence seriously . In 1993 , they decided to eliminate songs with profanity or misogynist lyrics from WBLS ' playlist , effectively booting hip-hop off its airwaves . <p> If Sutton was the man behind BLS ' success , Frankie Crocker was the man in the spotlight . Handsome , sharp-dressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relying as much on his supersuave style and attitude as his velvety voice and impeccable ear . <p> Crocker 's first stint at WBLS was interrupted in the mid-1970s , when he was implicated in a payola scandal . A perjury conviction was overturned , and Crocker paid only a $ 2,500 fine on a tax charge . <p> At his comeback in 1979 , Crocker arrived at a station promo party wearing a black tuxedo , riding a white stallion . His musical mix was like nothing else in New York 's rigid market - the Police bumping with Donna Summer , Nat King Cole following Earth , Wind &; Fire . <p> " If Frankie Crocker is n't on your radio , " his promotion jingled warned , " then your radio is n't on . " <p> Rival programmers threw up their hands ; one acknowledged Crocker could add songs to other station 's playlists by playing a tune just once . Crocker reveled in the spotlight , answered to the name " Hollywood . " <p> Crocker left in 1984 , came back in 1989 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed . WBLS , like other locally owned stations nationwide , was suddenly pitted against deep-pocketed corporations given access to once untouchable markets . <p> Before deregulation , ownership was capped at 20 stations nationally and four in any market - two AM and two FM . Now , there 's no national limit ( Evergreen owns 34 stations ) and a limit of eight locally ( Infinity Broadcasting owns five FM stations in Dallas ) . <p> " It 's a really dramatic , radical remaking of the landscape , " says Tom Taylor of Inside Radio , a fax newsletter . " The market separates into the very large companies versus the stand-alones ( like WBLS ) , the mom and pops . " <p> In June 1994 , Emmis spent $ 68 million on KISS-FM . The station had played an urban contemporary mix of everything from hard-core rap to soft R &B.; <p> Emmis already owned Hot-97 - which dominated the teen market with a rap-and-R &B; format - and sought WBLS ' upscale 25-to-54 crowd . <p> Extensive market research , combined with a gut feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " smooth R &B; and classic soul , " a mantra repeated by their high-profile spokesfolk . <p> Within weeks , KISS seemed to blare from every taxi , boom box and office in the city . <p> " An excellent marketing move , and a brilliant programming move , " Sutton admits . WBLS ' initial response : nothing . It stuck with its playlist , a computer-culled collection of tunes that ignored its history . <p> The spring 1995 ratings arrived with shocking news : KISS was No. 1 . Hot-97 was No. 2 . And WBLS tumbled from No. 5 to No. 13 , with an audience less than half the share of either competitor . <p> That April , when Emmis vice president Judy Ellis tuned her radio to WBLS , she heard something odd . " I recognized , " she recalls , " that BLS had changed their format and was playing ours . " <p> They did for the next two months . WBLS dumped its program director , hired a consultant , held endless meetings , tried to figure out what went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ones formed . Barry White became KISS ' on-air spokesman . Isaac Hayes became the KISS morning DJ . Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson wound up hosting a KISS afternoon show . <p> " It 's real life , and that 's the way it happens , " says Simpson , a Sutton family friend . " We bump into them socially all the time . It 's a friendly competition - but it 's a competition . " <p> Certain defections hurt more than others - particularly Jesse Jackson 's appearance in a KISS " Black History Month " promotion . " I was offended , " says Oliver Sutton . " At least call me , let me counter - you know ? " <p> Jackson 's wife still holds Inner City stock ( it was valued in 1988 at more than $ 250,000 ) . Another Inner City stockholder , singer Roberta Flack , hosts a weekend show on KISS . <p> Sutton fought back . He launched a brief on-air campaign ripping KISS and Hot-97 as white-operated " plantation stations . " <p> " It created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But it did n't staunch the bleeding . <p> Finally , the Suttons asked Frankie Crocker to mount that white stallion once again , and rescue the station he had built . <p> He walked into WBLS nine months ago to find " a station in bedlam . " Much of the station 's record library , the heart of Crocker 's oft-imitated " urban contemporary " sound , was gone - literally dumped in the garbage . What was left was useless - " only 15 CDs of any significance , " Crocker says . <p> " The guys that were here not only kicked the old audience out , they cursed at ' em when they were leaving , " says Crocker . <p> He laughs , but there 's little mirth . <p> He does not find the desertions of Ashford &; Simpson and the others very funny : " A few of the artists , whom I had relationships with and was instrumental in their careers - it bothers me that they would form an allegiance with somebody who 's trying to put me out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not competitive . " I listened to KISS for one day , and I knew I could beat it , " Crocker says fearlessly , sitting in his office while eating an Italian takeout lunch , fielding phone calls and listening to the latest track from the group Solo . <p> He recalls how he returned in 1979 to defeat a resurgent WKTU . " I knew I could beat that , and I sat down and did it . No big deal . " <p> Now , as then , Crocker 's biggest weapon is himself . Frankie is doing double-duty in resuscitating the ratings : picking the music and handling afternoon drive . <p> One Crocker trademark , breaking new artists , has already returned - he jumped on the debut single by Maxwell , which has become a radio and MTV hit . He 's planning a London vacation to see what 's happening overseas , checking the club scene , updating the BLS playlist with a more contemporary mix . <p> There are signs that he is working his magic ; WBLS was already up three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes there is no one in radio who can deny him . <p> " This is what I do , " he says . " I 've done it my whole life . And I will figure a way to beat you . "
