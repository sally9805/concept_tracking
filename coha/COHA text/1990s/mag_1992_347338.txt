" TRY ONE OF THESE , " MARK MILLER URGES HIS WARY GUEST , proffering a handmade sausage stuffed with duck , fig and habanero chile . Miller watches with satisfaction as his quarry reacts to a fugue of piquant flavors that slowly fades to a smoky afterburn . " The chile pushes the flavor , " explains Miller , who believes that good food should sing . " The duck fat is the low notes , " he says . " The habanero is the high notes . " <P> Miller , the nation 's foremost champion of hot cuisine , is conducting his experiment in the sculpted dining room of Red Sage , his $5.2 million , 18,800- sq. - ft . Western-style restaurant in Washington . Red Sage , which opened in January and is already booked weeks in advance , is an updated , upscale evocation of the American West rendered in buttery leather banquettes , panoramic murals and buffalo-motif chandeliers . In the street-level bar , cocktails are served with swizzle sticks that look like barbed wire , while on the ceiling a canopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The world looks at America , and it thinks about the West , " says Miller , who taught anthropology at the University of California , Berkeley , before switching to the kitchen . " There 's a spirit , a bravado , and Red Sage is part of that mythology . " <P> The food , which Miller dubs " modern Western , " is steeped in the same pioneering spirit . His eclectic menu ranges from neo-Tex-Mex tidbits like chipotle chile breadsticks to fresh-baked buckwheat cinnamon bread , smoked duck and buffalo jerky . " Smoking is a natural by-product of heat , " Miller says , launching into an aria of poetic exaltation . " There 's an intensity of wildness , of untamed flavor . It 's loaded symbolically with a primordial sense of fire and man . I read a lot of meaning into food . I think it 's one of the last experimental frontiers . " <P> Miller 's passion for untamed flavor began in his native Massachusetts , where Mexican and Indian friends of his French-Canadian family introduced him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Africa and Asia prompted him to experiment with ethnic accents , first as an assistant chef for nouvelle California guru Alice Waters at Chez Panisse in Berkeley and later in the same city at his own Fourth Street Grill , where he was one of the first chefs in the country to use mesquite wood for grilling . <P> In 1987 Miller opened the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe , New Mexico , specializing in a sophisticated fusion of nouvelle and traditional New Mexican fare . The restaurant was an instant hit as hordes of tourists fought their way to the tables to get their tongues tickled by his audacious , artfully presented dishes . That success put both haute Southwestern cooking and Miller on the culinary front burner . His Coyote Cafe cookbook has sold 90,000 copies since 1990 , and his latest collection , The Great Chile Book , published last December , has sold 40,000.
