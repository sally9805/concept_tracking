JO sits on a chair on the porch of her home . She wears sleek pants , a white linen blouse and heels . She is a 50 year old Japanese American woman . Her large purse sits to one side . In a chair next to her sits her niece , MILLIE , in her 30s , in halter top and fashion-torn jeans . She is slightly behind modern style . Between them is a small table . Millie pours Jo an ice tea . In the distance , a congregation sings Great is Thy Faithfulness . MILLIE Sheep mouths . JO They 're singing to God , they are n't singing for your entertainment . MILLIE I do n't care who they 're singing to . And if I were god I would n't be too entertained . Sheep mouths ; sheep brains . I swear they must leave their brains in jars at the door . All of them labeled " sheep Brains "  --  JO Oh , now Millie , just remember we used to be members . MILLIE  --  of course maybe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )  --  you 're brainless sheep that 's what you are !  --  ( to Jo ) and I only went because you dragged me there . JO Well , I get reminiscent once in a while , do n't you ? I know you must , Millie. p. 3 MILLIE I do n't waste my time . Besides Mikey 's memorial was as much church as I wan na see for a long time . JO  --  I know you 've moved on to the real world , what did we call that ? The secular world ! You 're more open-minded , unlike your old Aunty Jo . But once in a while , I get curious , do n't you ? I would just like to drop by , see the girls again , even though they wear way too much eyebrow pencil . I 'd like to go visit them . Reminds me of way way back when your parents would drop you off here . For months at a time . They were busy folks , were n't they . They still are . They still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we helped each other out , did n't we ? Oh , come on , it was n't all that bad , church was church . MILLIE I 'm not going again unless it 's absolutely necessary . JO But just went yesterday , and see ? It was n't that bad . MILLIE That was absolutely necessary . But Mikey 's memorial was excruciating all the same . Why ca n't they let him die without their sheep brain smiles slimed all over his casket ? Jesus H. Christ . JO Millie ! MILLIE I can say that now I 'm over 21 . Smiling sniveling little evangelists . JO They have their good points . p. 4 MILLIE Well , you go visit them anytime you feel like singing . JO I ca n't . Someone needs to mind this house . I stay in as much as possible . MILLIE I do n't think this house is gon na walk away . Get out once in a while . It 's more healthy for you . JO I get out during the week , do my shopping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sundays , did you know that ? So I stay in . Ah , but you 're a young spring chicken , you do n't fully grasp a thief coveting property . I need to watch this place , especially on Sundays . Someone needs to . MILLIE I can watch the house for you . JO No . It 's much more complicated than that . You 'd have to drive me down there . You do n't expect me to walk that steep hill . It 's murder on the ankles , both ways . So if you drove me , this place would be unguarded and we ca n't have that . MILLIE You have a car . JO I do n't drive on Sundays anymore . MILLIE OK . Why ? JO Because one of those hoodlums might steal it right from the church parking lot , right under my nose while I 'm praying , goddammit  --  and I can swear , I 'm way over 21 thank you  --  and that would be too much irony it my life . I will not have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little nest egg . Repeat after me " Crime is highest on Sundays " . " Crime is the highest on Sundays . " Come on . p. 5 MILLIE " Crime is highest on Sundays , " yeah , yeah Music Stops . They listen JO Wait . Now the pastor 's begun . He always starts with a prayer . Hear it ? ( She prays ) MILLIE Are you praying ? I ca n't believe it , just go down there with them . JO No . I can pray from here . A person can pray from anywhere . All they have to do is get down on their knees and begin . It takes no special building or purple sashes on an altar or wafers as in the Catholic tradition . All He asks is that you pray from here . ( Points to heart ) MILLIE Jesus . Douglas Presbyterian scares you . JO Of course not . MILLIE Then why not visit ? ( Pause ) You 're afraid of the people in the church , in the pews . People looking at you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . Why would anyone look at me ? I 'm in the masses . I 'm not important  --  MILLIE Ah , but you are important . They 'll remember : You 're the one with the million . The green in your bank . They remember you . They may be sheep but they remember particular things . They heard your footsteps when you came into Mikey 's memorial service and plunked down . Everyone stared out of the corners of their eyes , even while they were all sullen and wearing black armbands . Mr. Kano strained his eyes so far to the side of the sockets he looked like a zombie . Everyone remembers Million Dollar Aunty Jo ! p. 6 JO Stop it , you are a cruel person . I thought only Peter Goshan would say things like that . MILLIE Who 's Peter Goshan ? That white man who married Lillian ? No . You 're mixing up cruel with white . JO I hate that word . Do n't use that word in my house . MILLIE OK . Not White . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called them " Modern Trustees of Goodness . " And today they 're cruel ? Make your mind about white people . JO I do n't have to make up my mind about an entire race ; I examine each individual personality with a critical eye . And Peter is cruel because he makes his cute happa children wear those hideous knit shirts from Sears with the dragon blowing fire from its mouth , which  --  since I know you are n't up on high fashion  --  is an Izod rip-offs . What 's worse is both alligators and dragons went out with children 's Gerranimals and teenager 's plastic combs . That , in Jo 's book equals cruel . MILLIE Maybe they 're poor . JO One person 's poverty is another 's bad taste in apparel . God knows why he makes his little happa children dress so badly . Lillian would n't make them dress that way . They take after their father . Douglas Church used to be such a family church . A clean church , no one was an eyesore . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coordination . When the congregation lost sensibilities in clothes , the families began to fade . Someone needs to re-aline their fashion spine ( she straightens in her seat ) . We should go back to make a family showing , just you and I , representing the Onaga's. p. 7 MILLIE I told you I despise that place . I only went back because Mikey 's dead and even that turned into a twisted nightmare with their smiles . You know , I used to want to smack some of them in the face , get them to wake up , but I ca n't even smack them because they 're so helpless . And you know the worst part ? I was helpless too . JO We all become helpless before God . MILLIE ( Ignoring this ) Yesterday , at that service , I felt stuck again in that big muddy vat of church goers . Bunch of Nisei 's , Sansei 's and Super Japs with big hair all crying and singing Wes Terasaki songs  --  ( sings ) " Jesus , we 'd like to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a Friday Night Fellowship instead of a service for his dead body . You know , it 's so odd . Back then I could n't talk much . I was a miniature misshapen elephant forced into the body of a silent girl . That 's how awkward I was . And yesterday , it all came back . I could n't talk yesterday either . ( Thinking of the past ) I should 've said something . JO Did n't they take testimony ? MILLIE No , not last night . Before . A long time ago . I should 've said something too well . They 're still the same , feeling sorry from him . Sorry for him , or they sorry for themselves . The more things change the more they stay the same . p. 8 JO ( Sighs ) No , they have changed , Millie . Used to be a family church . Now , people go in there and pray and pray but it 's really all for gossip , a social hour . MILLIE They all talk about your winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's blessing And a test for me . Do you know how I got the winning lotto ticket ? MILLIE You said you won at Alpha Beta . JO A decoy . I won it in the White Elephant Game at last year 's food festival . MILLIE No shit . JO But this is confidential , what I 'm going to tell you . ( Moves in closer . Starts in a whisper , then builds ) We played this white elephant card came . When your card gets called you get to chose a prize from the pot . All these gifts wrapped in glossy magazine paper . Rather attractive . But by the time my card got called , all the gifts wrapped in magazine paper were gone , the only ones left were those in unobtrusive newspaper , the classified section . An unobtrusive gift , the junk prize , from squeezing it , I knew it was a roll of toilet paper . Everybody knew it was the katonk prize . Francie kept saying , " you gon na get stuck with the katonk prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper wrapper while you sit on the toilet ! " And when all the cards were called everyone opened their gifts and the women were yapping and yapping and I slipped out with my roll of toilet paper . p. 9 MILLIE You knew you 'd won . JO No . Not then . I just wanted to be alone with my junk prize . I did n't know until I was home , sitting here , on the porch . I opened it and there inside was one lottery ticket . They 're so cheap now they only gave me one , but one 's all I needed . It says to scratch with a coin , but I used my thumbnail and felt the silver wax get underneath . And it said I won 2,000 and a chance at the Big Spin and , well you saw the rest on t.v . MILLIE Would n't have missed it for the world . JO You sure as hell would n't . You got to watch your Aunty make a fool of herself . Jumping up and down and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord ! Oh my god ! Oh my god ! " Remember ? And then  --  now most people did n't catch this because of the cacophony of balloons and the dancing girls in glittery bathing suits that smothered me  --  I was yelling with my arms up swaying in the air , " This church is so lucky ! Thank you God for this lucky church ! " So you see . The lowest of all gifts , the one you use to wipe your shit , it 's the winning lotto ticket . MILLIE Aunty , this church is n't lucky , it 's You know it 's purely coincidence you won the lotto through Douglas  --  JO But , you see you are impressed to some degree , otherwise you would n't be visiting . p. 10 MILLIE I 'm here because Mikey died and you said you had cancer . JO I do . MILLIE A scab on your knuckle . JO It could be the first stages . MILLIE That 's not how cancer works . JO How does it then ? MILLIE I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JO See , just like old times . ( Beat ) So , I 'm waiting for this explanation . MILLIE First you get a black spot . ( Searches for answer ) And then it gets bigger . You do n't have it . JO We 'll wait for the lab results . MILLIE Fine . Anyway . That 's why I drove all the way up here , to see you . JO Brought a suitcase . Seven pairs of boots . See , just like old times , you liked to pack lots of odd clothes . MILLIE I plan to be here to help you through whatever it was that 's wrong . JO  --  Five pairs of boots , nice leathery ones , too . One for each day of the week of vigil to watch Aunty tip over . p. 11 MILLIE And do n't forget the black pumps for the funeral , I 'm waiting for you to die . JO I 'm not gone yet . MILLIE  --  and you 're not going to die . JO You want my money , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not the admitting type . You want to win too ? Seems everyone does , I would n't put anyone past it , even my own flesh and blood . I probably would do the same , if I were you . Here . You want to win at this too ? ( Pulls a roll of toilet paper out from her large purse ) I want you to have this roll of toilet paper . ( Pushes it into Millie 's hands ) It 's the same one . Maybe it will bring you luck , or curses . MILLIE I do n't want this . JO Yes , I hope it brings you dirty smiling eyes from all those women in the pews . MILLIE Aunty Jo calm down , I do n't want your money  --  JO I hope they smile at you during fellowship hour . Smile through their teeth and glassy eyes . MILLIE I do n't want your filthy gift . JO Take it . The church gave it to me . Wipe your excrement with it . All your proud young B.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous filth . p. 12 MILLIE You 're the one that 's jealous . You ca n't even see it you 're so caught up in green martyrdom . JO Now I 'm the jealous one . And how am I jealous ? MILLIE Do n't you get it ? You have money , but you do n't have the inside track . You have money , but you ca n't be in on the gossip any more , because you are the gossip . Aunty Jo , the millionaire  --  JO I never stirred anything up  --  MILLIE  --  of course now any mischief you tried to create would have the effectiveness of a poorly rhymed limerick  --  JO  --  I keep a forthright mind . MILLIE Not about Mikey 's death , you sure did n't . You never talked about that with the girls , or described horrified and wide-eyed his brother musta been when he found him there , dangling from a rope haloed around his blue head in the garage ? Never talked about that or Christine 's boyfriend and her getting married or Reverend Yamashita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't accompany Bruce when he sings or about my lover  --  JO Your lover ? MILLIE Oh , do n't tell me you never talked about her , you always chattered like a female duck , and now you say you never talked about me and my lover ? JO No . Never . ( Beat ) @x Late that evening . Millie is asleep on living room couch . Jo enters sleepwalking . JO I 've been a terrible girl . MILLIE Jo ? JO I 've been terrible . MILLIE You 're sleep walking . You got ta break this habit . Go back to bed . JO No , I 'm not sleep walking . I 'm telling you I 've been terrible . Because I do n't stand up to boys anymore . I 'm difficult with women . But so terribly nice with them , the boys . MILLIE No Aunty Jo , you 're just nice to them . JO I 've been thinking maybe I should stand up to them more , when I was young , when I was a little girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a tomboy , always had dirty pants , and dirty hair , some kind of smudge on my cheek . And I wore my shoes into the house , trudged right across . Am I supposed to take them off here , too ? Take off my getas , just like in the movies ? Do you think I should do that shoe custom ? MILLIE No . JO Why not ? MILLIE Because it takes too long . p. 14 JO But then I could have such nice carpet that way , instead of this green-brown-ish rug , I could afford white . Clean . MILLIE It is clean . JO I do n't mean " afford " as in money , we all have plenty of money , do n't we ? We all have plenty of money . But I 'm talking about can I afford to have a clean carpet : can I afford to take off my shoes each evening when I come in and take the time to put my shoes on each morning at the door . MILLIE Everyone does that , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the entry . JO I 'm going to begin leaving mine by the door and so should you . No , no . You see ? There I go again , you have to catch me when I act so nice , I 'm leaving my shoes on , trudging the mud right into my home , like a tomboy . I hope you do n't mind . MILLIE It 's your place . JO That 's right . There 's already dirt on the floor . My mud wo n't add any stains or scars to the carpet . ( Pause ) Do you know that Max is so picky ? He has all his shoes lined up when I visited his place . I bet he 's trying to make me see how clean he is . He wants me to visit again , too , he 's warming me up , you know , because he wants me to give to their SEYO league . p. 15 MILLIE Are you going to ? JO Of course not . Millie . Listen . If I gave to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the NCRR , I 'd be broke and then you would be too . MILLIE I told you , I do n't want your money . Jo . I ca n't believe you stay awake at night thrashing around about all your money . Just give it to SEYO , if you want . It 's for a good sport league , you said you liked basketball . Give it to them . They can be your charity . Then you could sleep at night . JO Basketball ? I hate basketball . I never said I liked sports . You did . I said I was a tomboy . I hated organized activities , they just want to gather you around in a pow-wow and pump you up to kill , " Let 's go get ' em ! Let 's show ' em , rip tug , demolish their skins , poke their eyes out ! Make havoc , make a hole on the court floor , I want to hear those tennis shoes screeching on the pinewood like carnivorous mice , small , white carnivorous mice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in a group led by mouths and tongues that provoke violence . Max wants me to promote violence by giving to SEYO . Do you want me to bequeath my money to rodents ? MILLIE Give your money to whomever you please . What 's the bid deal ? JO ( slowly waking ) Millie , I just do n't know who to trust , when it comes to gold and silver and overflowing bank accounts . p. 16 MILLIE Jesus , this money thing is driving you crazy . JO But I do trust you . My only niece . My blood . MILLIE It 's making me a little nuts , too . ( gently ) Look . Do whatever you like , but do it soon if you 're gon na do it , OK ? ( pause ) I mean , be realistic . What if you die ? Where 's it gon na go ? Back to the lotto people ? JO ( fully awake ) You 'd like me to say " Then if I die , I 'll let you inherit all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If . That 's a big if . My death is not my big concern , it 's not very probable . Where as how I spend my wealth while I 'm alive , that 's important . I may have cancer --  MILLIE You do n't have cancer --  JO But I may live a while longer . I have plenty of time to decide who will be in my will . MILLIE But , now use your imagination . What if you died suddenly . Sudden heart attack , a fatal clot in the brain . Or what if someone killed you ? What if you were stabbed in the back with a butter knife . JO That 's not about to happen . MILLIE Just a precaution . I want you to consider all your options , consider everyone a potential charity and quiet enemy . Anything could happen . After all crime is highest on Sundays . Someone could just walk in this room . I mean , what if I did you in myself ? p. 17 JO It would leave an awful blood stain on my sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa too , you ungrateful relative , too bad you 're the only kin I can trust . Is that what lesbians do . I saw that ice pick movie . MILLIE Look . It 's late and I do n't have an ice pick and for your information , just because she 's a woman does n't make me a lesbian . JO Then what do you call that ? MILLIE It 's fluid . JO Oh . So is that the term nowadays . Fluid ? MILLIE I just do n't need you to spread it all over the place . JO I wo n't tell a soul . That I have n't already told . MILLIE So . The money . Give it to SEYO . JO No ! I hate SEYO and basketball , I hate Max with his neat Ikebana flowers and plants and tile floors and serving me tea . You know he served me tea and arare ? All this Japanesey stuff , trying to get me to remember , " never forsake your community . " Hah . The community . The SEYO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just think about the youth , Josephine , they are our future , the youth league turns to those with philanthropic sprits . " Yeah ? Then go ask the church , goddamn Reverend Higa makes big bucks , you know that 10% tithing ? He makes 5% of that 10%. p. 18 MILLIE That 's a lie . JO Ooh , when did you start becoming an expert on churches ? Have you seen his tax return ? No . Well , Reverend Yamashita makes more than I ever did and I do n't see us courting him for money . I do n't see why Max should get my money . Everyone keeps asking for my money . My money . They want my money ! They want me . He wants me , does n't he ? Just like the Rev. Yamashita and all the other men there . They just want to get me to do this and that for them , to listen and obey them , to , to --  KNOCK on the door . They stop and listen . VOICE Ms. Onaga ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's me . Critter . You said I could come visit . JO ( whispering to Millie ) Who the hell is this boy ? Millie grasps her hands around her neck , pantomiming a person who has been hung . VOICE I 'm his brother . JO ( Sweetly ) Oh , just a minute ! Millie opens door . A young boy enters with a medical bag and stands in the living room . MILLIE It 's really late , Critter. p. 19 CRITTER No , it 's early . It 's three o'clock . JO Goodness , is it really so late . Well , young man , you must rise early with the earthworms . CRITTER I could n't sleep . I needed to talk to you . JO Oh . About ? CRITTER About my height . I 'm concerned about my height . Sometimes I ca n't see my feet . Like right now , because I 'm too tall for my age . JO How old are you ? CRITTER Eleven . MILLIE Honey , how did you get here ? CRITTER Drove . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive ? CRITTER I 'm too short is the problem . So I could n't see my feet , it was dark near the pedals . I used blocks . On my feet , like the circus tall men . Plus all the lights are green , I never stopped . I never stop . I 'm a very mature eleven-year-old . MILLIE I suppose you did n't tell your parents you were coming . CRITTER My brother 's dead . MILLIE I know . p. 20 CRITTER That 's why I could n't sleep . In the evening my feet look Shortness keeps me from seeing over the horizon . I think I want him to come back but he left everything too organized , his room is all in place --  MILLIE So you think Mikey killed himself ? I do n't he 's not the type , he was kind of odd , but he would n't do himself in . JO ( To Millie ) Ah , but you did n't know his dark side , his under-the-skin side , that 's how I knew him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Grocery errands . He was such a sweet boy , but he had something about him that needed to sweat through his pores , he was just beginning to fever when I met him . I 'm so glad to meet you , he did n't talk about his family much , but I knew he had a little half-brother , even though your father is absent , Mikey loved his family --  CRITTER That goes without saying that the family loved . I 'm just concerned that I 'm too tall . MILLIE I thought you were too short . CRITTER But then I grow and I 'm too tall . Look . He puts on blocks , tied to feet and walks , then stands in the middle of the room on his blocks and continues . JO Geta. p. 21 CRITTER I had to cut him down . He was so high , I was unable to be tall at that moment when I burst open the garage door  --  squeak , squeak , bump  --  to get tennis balls . I could see him at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . But I sensed his movement , he moved simply from the banging open of the door . Mobile . MILLIE Oh , poor dear . This is upsetting you , let 's talk about something else , I have chocolate chips o'hoys and how about some milk --  JO It 's really late to be talking so graphically , honey --  CRITTER  - -  what do you know about late ? I loved my brother . He was a genius . The rope , I cut it with pinking shears and his body fell , heavier than I expected . I think I saw his face , I know I did . It was blue and chalky , just like a Japanese court lady , but he was in his plaid shirt and blue jeans , his arms hung out of the sleeves like fairy tale pictures of Man-o-war jelly fish , long and pulsating , I think he 'd been there since that morning , he was cold just like the garage was cold , and he took on the garage feeling . ( Hear something ) @x Max 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ikebana and bonsai plants . Very clean . Max serves Jo tea at the table . MAX So , Josephine . Are you interested ? JO Max , you know I love the community , you know I do , but I --  MAX We are a large and supportive community , the Japanese Community works together . The Japanese way is to always give back , when there 's a new youth missionary going to Japan , we all put in our 10% or whatever we can afford  --  the Koreans call it a key . JO Max . Tradition is fine , with the right amount of perspective --  MAX But it 's Japanese and American . Remember the Farm raising parties ? Like the one 's in those Little House on the Prairie books ? JO What 's Little House --  MAX Books my daughter reads in school , it 's about the American settlers , it 's the American way : Everyone gathers together to lift the barn walls with ropes and pulleys and the strongest men push the wall up with their bare hands . Then they all sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's American . It 's Japanese . You see , both . p. 24 JO That 's very informative , but --  MAX So you see , I 'm only asking you out of reasons of community and since the kids get so much out of SEYO  --  I know you have no children of your own --  JO Is that important ? MAX That you 'd have a special desire to help these children . JO But they have parents , it 's not as if they were little Orphan Annies . MAX But you are childless . JO There 's my niece , Millie . MAX I see . A possible heir . Is n't she ? JO Look . Is this about my childlessness or about the community ? MAX Well , both . JO Max , have you considered asking the church --  MAX Now you know the church is poor , Josephine , barely has enough to pay the rent , let alone help charities . JO I thought that 's what they were supposed to do . MAX When they can . JO And the Reverend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you know that 's confidential , Jo , people 's salaries . You would n't want people to know how much you 're making . JO I worked at Gemstone gems and if it 's anyone 's business , I made a decent twenty-five thousand per year . And now I 'm retired . MAX But the Lotto --  JO ( standing ) Max . Come to think of it , Everyone does know how much I 'm making . One million dollars . You know . I know . The church ladies know . MAX But not everyone knows or would understand . The outside world for example . If this had been a hakujin church , they would not understand . JO How do you know ? MAX Well , simply put , a hakujin church does things the hakujin way . They always talk about money . That 's why hakujins always sue each other . That 's why they 're always fighting and have co-dependent families , angry fathers and abandoned children , problems we do n't have in the Japanese American community . The Hakujin world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oriented . JO Cruel . MAX And we love each other . we simply understand what Jesus meant by Christian charity . p. 26 JO Are n't you mixing up cruel with the outside world ? MAX Exactly Josephine . The " outside world " and " cruel " are synonymous and so before you spend your money on material wealth , a new car , a fur , a swimming pool --  JO I do n't like chlorine pools , I was thinking more along the lines of a simple fish pond . MAX A koi pond then . Before material wealth , think of your community , give back . JO Max , do you think I should , really ? MAX Of course . You see the Nisei women understand Jesus ' Charity . They understand giving to others unconditionally and without an end to their surplus , like Jesus ' Thousands of Loaves of Bread . Just sign here , we 'll take very good care of your one million when you 're gone . We 'll set up a foundation in your name , Onaga Foundation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation . Now I hope this is n't too bold , a drinking fountain in the gym with your name on it , the fountain would be in the shape of your bust -- pardon that expression , you know , a statue from the chest up -- and the water would come out of your mouth and into the mouths of those thirsty basketball players , the children ! JO ( sitting ) Well , I that would be nice --  p. 27 MAX Just think of the exposure the way you 'd be remembered . And scholarships , we 'd give scholarships to children , like Mikey , rest his soul , would have had a chance to do what they always wanted in life , to have a higher educ --  JO  - -  Mikey , oh , Mikey , the dear . Do you think he really , Max , I have n't talked to anyone about it , do you think he really hung himself ? MAX Only the Lord knows that , only the Lord can determine where suicidal people go , but just think we have that opportunity to help those left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder and noose --  JO We could pay their whole tuition to USC ! MAX Well , the money would come from the interest , a foundation works that way , you know . But you do n't have to worry about all the details . We 'll build a foundation and a fountain , and the babes shall drink from your own spring of fresh water . Blessed water ! Holy water ! Are you interested , Josephine Onaga ? He pushes the paper between the two of them and waits . Jo picks up the pen . Deliberates . She looks at Max . He looks back . Lights fade and rise again . Max has left and in his place sits the GHOST OF MIKEY . His face is ashen . Scene resumes . JO It 's you ! p. 28 MIKEY Ms. Onaga . JO You 're white ! MIKEY No , I 'm Japanese . JO I mean your face . MIKEY Oh , that . ( Wipes face clean ) It 's just powder . I was rehearsing , did n't they tell you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was playing this man who is part alien who dies in a tree house . Kills himself accidentally . Naked . Masturbating . It 's a sci-fi about sex and humanoids . JO You were touching yourself ? MIKEY No . Yell yeah , for the part , I was exploring the role . About people who send signals through their genitals , so they can masturbate simultaneously in different houses , even thousands of light years away and it would be just like the real thing . JO That 's so ingenious , it 's so bold . MIKEY Oh . I thought you were going to say sinful . They all said sinful . I try not to think of them . Because I love god . Jesus saved my life and my family 's . I know that for sure . But the church said they were all out of trash bags so they could n't give us trash bags of clothes , not even hand-me-down sympathy . I did n't mind being a geek . I just wish they 'd given Critter some new sneakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no shoes at all . Anyway . I slipped , OK ? Mistake . I slipped , the stool toppled , snapped my neck , it was horrible , I 'm sorry Jo . p. 29 JO If you needed help you could 've asked me . Even love , I could 've given you love . MIKEY Oh . I never thought to ask . JO I could have . MIKEY Oh . Well . It 's a little late now , since I slipped , wrecked my neck . I was right in the middle of the star wars adventure script , too . You really would 've slept with me ? JO I did n't say that , Mikey , do n't put words in my mouth . But If you 'd asked . MIKEY I was pretty virgin , too . I was saving it for the right person . I kept thinking she must be in another room , somewhere , thinking of me , if we thought of each other simultaneously , even if we were thousands of light years away -- well , I digress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . ( he looks ) MIKEY So you did . ( he blows on the paper ) JO You made my signature disappear . MIKEY We are invisible . The quiet ones . But we are brilliant , are n't we ? This church is n't here to help people like me and you . They only help the ones that look the same . I did n't even have fire breathing dragon shirts like Peter Goshan 's kids . But when I died , my class status went way up . That 's really what the Buddhists meant by reincarnation . He reaches over and kisses her hand , then disappears as lights fade@@ The year is 1979 . A Bright sunny Church day . Millie and Mikey are in early high school . Millie stands alone in a crowd of Japanese American churchgoers . JULIE ( To Millie ) So , it 's like , you know he said , " pretty much not , like shoot , you gon na go with him Julie ? " I said , " shoots it 's none of your beeswax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want from me anyway , like I 'm gon na do something physical-like wit him , like shoot , no way , he 's such a skebejiisan , would you go out wit him ? MILLIE Uh no . JULIE Right . Like pretty much not , like no way . You think he 'd leave me alone now , but then he comes up to me , with this , shoot , this little nerf ball , and he says , " This is a female egg , and the sperm goes into it . " I said , you 're really weird , you know , like leave me alone . God  --  oh excuse me  --  gosh , we got ta find better guys , so you know , we 're planning to go to G. Anyway . ( Pause ) shoooot . ( Pause ) Like , how 's your walk with the Lord ? MILLIE Uh . It 's good . I have n't been able to do my Quiet Time every morning with school . JULIE Shoot . It 's OK , sometimes I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's G ? JULIE Gardena . MILLIE Oh . I did n't get what you 're saying about G. JULIE ( Friendly but formally ) Do you want to go to Gardena Valley Baptist with us ? We are going to visit their youth group . MILLIE Ooooh . Mikey walks by . MILLIE I uh . I guess I 'll go , am I invited ? JULIE ( Forced smile ) Yeah . Sure . MILLIE How do we get there ? JULIE Mikey can drive . MILLIE Mikey ?  --  JULIE  - -  Mikey Lee . He 's driving Chrissy and Patsy and Suzie and Francie and me . MILLIE ( Referring to Mikey ) Who 's that ? JULIE That 's the other Mikey . But do n't pay any attention to him . He 's just like that . ( To another girl ) No way , look you look jammin ! You look Pretty much not , no this looks great . And a new coif , like shoooot , no way --  MILLIE Is there enough room in the car ? p. 32 JULIE We can all fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's OK . I 'll pass . Next time . JULIE You sure ? ( quickly ) OK . Next time . ( She continues to talk silently to other friend ) So , it 's like , he 's such a skebe jisaan Millie approaches Mikey . MIKEY Hi . MILLIE Hi . I 'm Millie MIKEY I 'm Mike y . MILLIE What are you doing ? Just walking ? MIKEY Thinking . Passes the time during the gap between Sunday school and service . MILLIE Look at the bees ( points to ground ) . MIKEY Yeah . They must have an underground colony . MILLIE Wow . There 's so many . MIKEY You ever read that book about the queen bee and her underground colony ? MILLIE No . MIKEY I got it at the library . I go there a lot . The City one . My school one is too puny . Do you like D&amp;D ? p. 33 MILLIE That fantasy game . MIKEY It 's more than that . MILLIE My friends like it . MIKEY See , I 'm the dungeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means I 'm kind of omniscient . I create my game rules . All the ways things happen . MILLIE Then what 's the fun ? MIKEY I only make the big plans ; game rules and powers , I assign powers , then everyone does whatever they want , within those parameters . ( Takes out sketch book ) Like this character , the wizard-child , has a magic bag and three potions and can cause other characters to lose their memory , for just a moment while he escapes . And this purple worm can do practically any thing . But you have to harness its energy , that 's the catch . He 's a very powerful character . MILLIE Maybe it 's a girl worm . MIKEY ( Considers this ) Could be . Or maybe it 's a hermaphrodite . Are you a lesbian ? MILLIE No . Why ? MIKEY I du n no . One of the players is a lesbian . She acts like you . MILLIE Are you uh p. 34 MIKEY I du n no . I go to church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long awkward pause . She steps in a little closer . He steps back . Then foward . They kiss suddenly and purely . They turn away from each other . MILLIE How 's your walk with the Lord ? MIKEY Oh , uh . fine . I have n't been reading enough . Have n't had my Quiet Time recently . MILLIE Me neither . MIKEY ( Pause ) How 's your walk ? MILLIE It 's non-existent . They turn to look at each other , lights fade on Mikey . Millie still in shaft of light . MILLIE I mean , I 'd like to talk to you about can I tell you , I think you 're gon na kill yourself , or have an accident . And I was wondering , would you like to go to the prom or something . Or maybe start small , a movie . You wan na see a movie ? Jesus Christ . I 'm not good at this . Look anything , anything it takes , OK ? One day I swear we 're gon na turn around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How style and being popular does n't really matter when you got your whole long life ahead  --  I did n't mean it like that . I mean , I mean I wish I 'd at least known another silent kid when I met them , but it was the best I could do , being silent myself . ( Pause . She looks at the empty place where Mikey just stood ) @x The present again . Critter is in garage , holds noose which he cut from the rafters CRITTER ( testing sound in garage ) oooo ( echo ) oooo ( echo ) Hey . ( echo ) Mikey.Mikey appears . CRITTER You wan na go to church tomorrow ? MIKEY Sure . CRITTER Cuz mom 's not going . MIKEY Well , she 's just tired . It 'll be OK . CRITTER Yeah . ( Pause . Then suddenly ) What about Pontius Pilate , would he  --  is he considered guilty , or did he was he cleared because he washed his hands ? MIKEY He washed his hands . I guess the stain does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of that crowd of people . that 's all I know . We 'll look it up later , OK ? CRITTER OK . ( Pause ) You know Dad came by today . MIKEY ( Concerned ) Really . Who was home ? CRITTER Just me. p. 36 MIKEY What did he want ? CRITTER He said he wanted to see you and me . Said he misses us . He says he knows he 's been a poor corespondent . MIKEY Does he miss Mom ? ( no reply ) So , what are you gon na tell her ? CRITTER Nothin ' . Mom 's tired . Sick . I told him to come back another time . I did n't tell him about you . MIKEY Do n't let your dad come back in , OK ? Crit , please do n't forget . CRITTER What 's wrong Mikey ? MIKEY We have a restraining order . He ca n't come within a two mile radius . CRITTER He says he misses us . I forgot to ask you why you left . MIKEY I slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsing a scene that called for nudity . CRITTER Obviously . MIKEY That 's all . Do n't ask me anymore , OK ? CRITTER I thought you were writing about elephants that disappeared by sucking themselves back through their long noses . p. 37 MIKEY It is about elephants , and other things . Sci-fi has lots of things , humanoids , animals --  CRITTER Do n't patronize me , what the hell were you doing in there ? Knock on the door . MIKEY Just stay quiet , he 'll go away . No Critter . Stay down , Crit . Critter , almost in a trance , opens door slowly , we can not see person standing in the entry , but it is someone tall . CRITTER No . You ca n't come in . Mom 's resting . She 's tired . I 'm tired . And Mikey 's gone . ( Pause , accepts a gift ) . Thanks . Critter closes door and comes back in with a huge clear package of new toilet paper rolls . He takes one out and examines it. @x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of a fully youth group choir , who are singing . Everyone wears a robe except Millie and Jo , who look totally out of place by both age and attire . MAX ( finishing ) What the Lord has taught us is that Faith ! We must have faith in Him . Only he knows best what will be the path for Mikey Yamada , only He knows if he 's gone to see his Maker . And as humble member of this congregation , I urge you to , if you can , make every effort to keep the youth from falling , give what you can --  JO ( loud whisper to Millie ) See ? ! He 's talking about me ! MILLIE Shhhhh. ! MAX . and we can have faith that he walks in god 's hands now . Let us take a moment of silent prayer and then you may come to pay last respects to our young child of god . Critter enters as the congregation prays . The casket is too high for him to see into . He puts his blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 feet taller , he towers over everyone . MILLIE ( looking up at Critter ) I 'm sorry . He 's dead . p. 39 CRITTER My brother 's really dead . Congregation lines up . One by one , before they view body , they take turns hugging Critter 's legs CONGREGATION ( one by one ) I 'm so sorry , if there 's anything we can do They all smile sadly and circle around see the body CRITTER Mom could n't make it . MILLIE OK . Are you sure you really want to see this ? CRITTER It 's just a dead body . It 's just a corpse . Like a chicken when you buy it at the grocery store --  MILLIE  - -  OK , OK , I get it . CRITTER it 's already dead . Big deal . Besides it 's not the way I remember him . JO I ca n't watch this . MAX Jo . It 's so good to see you here . So sad about Mikey . This is truly a sign from Jesus . JO What kind of sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in sings anymore , Max . Only what really happens . MILLIE ( Trying to lift casket lid ) It 's heavy . p. 40 CRITTER Mr Mr. Max ? Do you think Mikey 's in heaven ? MAX ( kneeling next to Critter ) Son , only the Lord knows for sure . CRITTER If Pontius Pilate washed his hands  --  MAX What ? You want to be a pilot ? Did you hear that Josephine ! Mikey 's brother already planning his future . Tell us about it --  CRITTER Never mind . MAX I do n't know about the air force , though . You 're a little short . CRITTER My father 's back . MAX Oh . CRITTER He says he wants me to go with him . JO Not that man . Critter , do n't let him near your mother , you listen to me . MAX Well . He is your father . ( Pause ) I ca n't stand in the way of family things . CRITTER Mom 's too tired . JO Max , you ca n't just let that man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to their mother when ever he comes back MAX I 'm sure it will all work out . We have to trust in God . p. 41 JO Critter . Listen to me . Do n't let that man in your front door . He 's trouble . Critter , if it comes down to it , I 'll help you in any way possible . In any way I can . ( Max looks Millie , holds out a pen . She looks at Max ) The way I want to . CRITTER Can Mom and I come live with you ? JO ( Long Pause . Jo looks at Critter , then at Millie , then at Max , then at Critter ) Yes . Yes you can . CRITTER Thank you . I 'd like to see his body now . MILLIE ( taking Jo aside , loud whisper ) Are you sure you want to ? JO I said yes , did n't I ? So that 's a yes . MILLIE Oh . JO The money goes to Critter . Is that what you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do want to know . Is that it ? JO He 's a good cause . He 's my charity . Now I can sleep at night . MILLIE OK . JO After what he 's been through , with his mother and brother and dangerous father . MILLIE ( not satisfied ) OK p. 42 JO I thought you said you did n't care . MILLIE How can anyone argue with that ? JO I 'm sorry Millie . I could give you some , there 's plenty to go around . MILLIE I do n't want it . ( Aside ) I just wish you 'd have asked me first . JO Asked you ? Asked you ? I was practically thrusting it on you . MILLIE No . You were teasing me , what did you want me to do if you teasing me like that ? I just ca n't believe that after all this , after all these boring years listening to boring sermons and living in your dumb-ass house , soothing you back to sleep at night , you decide to give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only gave it to him because you have a soft spot for the boys . JO Fuck you ! ( hushing ) I said there is plenty to go around , there always has been . MILLIE Then why could n't you just be nice and give -- offer it -- it too me first ? JO Because you would have said no . Because I know you , Millie . You did n't want my money , I do n't know what it is , but I could n't give it to you then , so why should I try to help cover up for it now ? And because , frankly , I 'm tired of everyone coming around just when I 've come into some money and I 'm dying . p. 43 MILLIE You are not dying . JO And it 's rude to argue with a rich dying woman . MILLIE It sure the hell is . And not only is it rude . It 's stupidly rude ! I should have known you better all these years , what an idiot I am to not know you better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you only think your sick and you only think you need this goddamn congregation because they are nice little phony friends --  JO Millie ! Not so loud ! There was a time when this church was your home , where your friends were --  MILLIE  - -  oh , right . This place was desolate for me . Why did you drag me , day after day after year after year to this church ? JO Well , at the time I thought you were having fun . MILLIE Having fun ? ! Having fun ? ! You think being fifteen and sitting in miniature plastic Sunday school chairs sized for kindergartners was fun ? ! Listening to bread and fish stories and singing sappy Wes Terasaki songs was fun ? ! JO  - -  besides , I had to take someone with me . I did n't want to have to go alone . I hated being alone all the time . And when you and me went to church we were n't alone , right ? We were with community , and the Japanese American 's understand charity . Just like Little House on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( deliberately ) At the time I thought you were having fun . MILLIE I spent eight lousy years of obscenely miniature chairs , did n't you care ? ( Snaps ) It was all I knew . ( Pause ) What did you want me to do for you ? Find you a girl scout troop , a lacrosse team , a Four-H club ? Throw you a debutante ball ? At Douglas there were once such good people --  MILLIE ( mockingly )  - -  family oriented , loved one another --  JO No , Damn it ! It was more than that . The youth minister said they could help kids like you , give them good friends , take them on retreats , teach them about god , goodness , sharing . MILLIE  - -  yeah , yeah , we learned all that crap --  JO  - -  and frankly you needed a boost . The way your parents kept traveling around the country , dropping you with whatever relative was handy , that was obscene . And I saw the way the youth would come back smiling after a seven-day retreat to Mount Hermon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played basketball after church in the parking lot , piled into cars with their boy and girl pals and drove to the beach , came back all sandy and tan , and I saw that they sang camp fire songs , and prayed together with their arms around each other . They were friends ! And I wanted that for you . That 's all I ever wanted for you , Millie . I cared so very little about god and heaven and hell , very little . But I wanted you to have friends , because I was such because I never had that kind of luck to have friends . And I knew that they could teach you to laugh and sing camp fire songs and pray together , to be together . I wanted you to join them . I wanted you to learn from them , because I knew they could teach you to be lucky in a way I never could teach you . p. 45 MILLIE ( Pause ) I guess things did n't turn out the way we thought they would . JO That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were the closest I ever came to a daughter . But I suppose we were n't that lucky , were we ? The congregation begins humming a communion song . Critter opens casket . The congregation looks inside . There 's no body , only clean loose fluffy toilet paper . Critter , Millie and Jo reach in , searching for body , as toilet paper billows out of casket onto floor . MIKEY ( In side spotlight ) I was an invisible elephant . But when you die , you move up on the class scale . That 's really what the Buddhists meant about reincarnation . ( He begins to sing ) ( Mikey ) Take this bread I give unto you And as you do ( Congregation ) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember me .

It 's 1979 again . Young Mikey asleep in his room . On the other side of town , in Jo 's house , is young Millie who is visiting her aunt , asleep in the living room . Suddenly both Mikey and Millie simultaneously awake , startled in their dreams . They gasp . They look about . Only cricket noises and darkness . Far away we see Jo with a candle , she comes closer and stands by Millie 's bed . Jo is sleep walking but is actually her present day age of 50 and she wears the same present day clothes . JO Youth is wasted . I wasted it . Why did you have to as well , child ? I had no idea you loved when you were young . MIKEY ( Hearing Jo 's voice , embarrassed ) We were n't in love . All we did was watch the bees together . JO That counts for something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Aunty Jo ? Aunty Jo ? Go back to bed . It 's alright . I think you 're sleepwalking . JO And if we had known how much silence cost him in his youth . Twenty-five cents per day . Times 365 days . Times years and years . It 's so much spent . MIKEY ( Practicing ) and I 'll say : ( across to Millie ) You know that D&amp;D gathering I told you about ? I would love to -- I would be honored if you could visit my house , we 're playing tonight , my friends would love to meet you . I have a friend named Elizabeth . She 's a lesbian . You 'd like her . Uh , I mean maybe you are too . I , I mean , maybe --  p. 48 MILLIE Sure , I 'd love to . JO And me ? I feel I just won someone 's wasted youth , that 's what winning money 's about . But it is n't quite the same . MILLIE Aunty , you 're still asleep . It 's OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not this time , not this time . MILLIE ( Practicing : ) and I 'll say : ( across to Mikey ) I would love to visit . Are your friends , uh , you know , bookish types ? MIKEY They only read things they want to . JO I would be so happy if I could sell all this money . Here take it , take it . I do n't want your money . What would I buy ? What ? I new car ? A new coat ? New memories of a different church ? Different friends that would come over and sit and talk and laugh , really laugh until we all rolled on the floor , on this brownish-greenish carpet and they 'd say " Your carpet , Jo , is such the wrong color ! " and " do you really want to take off your shoes at the door , that 's an old custom ! " and we would laugh and laugh about little funny things like that until tears shot out into our tea cups --  MILLIE Jo , wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is what I 'd buy : three good friends , and we 'd sit and play ma-jong , like , mmm , what 's that movie -- You know -- but we would n't even need the fancy sweaters , no would n't even need the sweaters and the jewelry , just the girls . Not even three . Just one . One who , if you call her late at night , would come over ( snaps her fingers ) like that , no questions asked , just company . She 'd die for me . And I for her . p. 49 MIKEY I 'd die for you . JO I 'm afraid you 've already died . MIKEY But I would have died for you . JO Youth is so wasted trying to save the old . Eventually we go . Regardless . So do n't waste your time dying for me . Save yourself . Why did you go so early ? MILLIE Aunty Jo . Go back to sleep . Tomorrow 's church , remember ? JO I will never go there again . Not with the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with is pen , his damn pen ! ( as if repeating a comforting line the two shared ) Millie -- why do you want to go visit church ? MILLIE Cuz we always go , every Sunday . ( Pause , trying to brighten ) Cuz all our friends are there . JO Oh , how we waste our young days . In anxiety to be free , we spin our minds like wild tops until we clatter nervously against one another , absolutely unbalanced , and then come to a stop on the kitchen floor . Totally separate from one another . And all too early . ( She looks at Mikey ) Mikey gets out of bed with his sheet wrapped around him . He walks over to Millie 's bedroom and stands in front her bed . p. 50 MIKEY ( Deep breath : )                                             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
