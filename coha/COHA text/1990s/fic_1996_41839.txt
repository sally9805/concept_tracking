I grew up in Garden City , a small Pennsylvania community where my brother , Adrian , and I were the only Jews in our elementary school . I got along better with the kids than Adrian , played sports and made friends more easily , but still I had my troubles . <p> One day I went into Mrs. Nick's-short for Nicodemus-a corner grocery store and fountain down the street from us . I sat at the counter with Warren Banks , my best friend . We did n't sit next to each other . You always had a seat between you , even when you went to the movies . It hinted of homosexuality to sit next to each other , to wish to be that close to another boy , and also maybe there was just the thing of wanting to spread out , establish your territory . I do n't know , but I do remember that day in Mrs. Nick 's store when Warren and I sat there spinning the stool between us , its silver sides whistling as we slapped the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cut it out , " said Mrs. Nick . We stopped . " What do you want ? " she asked Warren . <p> " Root beer float , " Warren said . Mrs. Nick nodded at him , looked at me . She had her hair up in blue curlers . She lived in the back with her husband , who worked at the shipyards in nearby Chester . My father was a doctor in the town . <p> " What about you , moneybags ? " I heard laughter from down the counter , where the teenagers hung out . <p> " Black and white ; I said inaudibly . " What ? " <p> " Milkshake . Black and white . " I was burning up with shame . Warren looked straight ahead . The three teenagers at the other end snickered . They were just out of high school and worked the night shift in Chester at Scott Paper . <p> Mrs. Nick went over to the fountain and mixed up ice cream and root beer and filled it with soda water . She brought the frosted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of him . Then she disappeared into the back of the store . <p> I sat there with my head down . I could hear Warren sucking gently on his straw . We came here every day after school to have drinks at the counter . Why had she said that ? " Moneybags . " <p> Five minutes passed . Mrs. Nick did n't come out . I slid off the stool and glanced at Warren . He was trying to go slow on his drink but was already down to the dregs . I went over to the magazine rack and looked at the cover of the new Superman comic . Jimmy Olsen had superpowers . His freckled face and red hair were still there , but his arms and shoulders rippled with muscles . Superman , meanwhile , had changed places with him and looked puny and frightened . Lois Lane was in the background glancing desirably at Jimmy . It was all turned around and all temporary , of course . I knew Superman would be restored to his powers , Jimmy would return to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeless crush on the Man of Steel . <p> I reached in my pants pocket for a quarter left over from lunch . It was 1959 , and Superman comics had just gone up from ten to twelve cents . When I 'd first started collecting them , they were only five cents each . <p> Warren came over and stood next to me at the cash register . He was from the project , where many of the kids whom I went to school with lived . The project consisted of squat , brown stucco buildings built during the Second World War . They had tiny yards tied together by a maze of chain-link fences . A metal pole webbed with clothesline stood in the corner of each yard , taking the place of a shade tree . The driveways were concrete runners with weeds growing between them . Fights broke out regularly , dogs choked on their chains , and mothers screamed openly at their kids . I was n't allowed to go in there , except to Warren 's house , which was on the edge closest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Corky Innes , shooting a thumb my way , " you got a customer . " Corky " Kong " Innes lived with his brother , Richie , down the street from us . They called him " Kong " because of his car , a souped-up , black Dodge so shiny " you can see your pimples in it , " Corky would say . With a 426 Hemi , dual quads , a Detroit locker , and hooker headers , the car was rumored to need a parachute to stop . Under its dash , the Kongmobile had a record player installed that played forty-fives . Warren and I would sit in it at Mrs. Nick 's , listen to " Sea of Love , " " Mr. Blue , " and " Kansas City , " stick our elbows out the windows , and pretend to peel out . Mrs. Nick stayed at the other end of the counter washing a glass by hand . <p> " Hey , Mrs. Nick , " said Corky , and I wished he would shut up . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , " I said quietly . " I can buy it for you , " said Warren . <p> I shook my head . I just wanted to get out of here . My face had turned red , and I was afraid if I stayed around I 'd start crying . But Corky , whose father owned a tavern in Chester , and who I was beginning to see was a true lunkhead when it came to social matters that I instinctively understood , would n't drop the subject . He grabbed the quarter from my hand and swaggered it over to Mrs. Nick . " Here you go , " he said , and slapped the coin onto the counter . The quarter wobbled in front of her , then stopped dead with a dull tink . Mrs. Nick let it lay there , as I knew she would . Corky , dimwit , confidant to his gonads , palmed the quarter , tossed it in his mouth , and swallowed it down with an audible gulp . It was one of his tricks . Years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was lost on us all now . We were n't thinking about cancer , nor what would become of us , including Mrs. Nick , whose store would close up in five years after she had a fatal heart attack , her store becoming a beauty parlor , then a funeral home , and there would be no sign of that day when I was refused service , and Corky ate my quarter and then pretended to barf it up and hand it back to me , a true idiot , who had forgotten why he was even holding it . <p> I walked out of the store , Warren following . We did n't talk about what happened on the way home . But we did pass the Olans ' house . Broken bottles and trash were in their front yard , and freshly painted since the last time they 'd erased it was GO HOME NIGGERS on the side of their white clapboard house with blue shutters . Two weeks ago they 'd moved into the home on Rynard Road , the only black family in Garden City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoned , their car 's windshield smashed , their two children taunted when they 'd tried to attend the local elementary school . " Hi , Officer Dennis , " Warren said , as we walked past the Olans ' house . He was patrolling back and forth on the sidewalk in front . His uniform said " Garden City Township Police . " " Howdy , " he said . " You boys just getting home from school ? " " We went to Mrs. Nick 's , " said Warren . " Where 's my hoagie , then ? " said Officer Dennis . He was Gloria Dennis 's father . Gloria was two grades ahead of us , in fifth , and " developed . " <p> " We ate it , " said Warren . <p> " You ate it , did you ? " Officer Dennis joked . " Well , that 's not going to help me now is it ? " I wanted to keep walking , but Warren had stopped and was staring at the Olans ' home . You could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in daytime . Their father , I 'd heard , was escorted in and out of the house to work at his accounting office . Groceries were brought to them through the back door . Officer Dennis said , " So what 's new at school ? " Officer Dennis seemed to want company . " Your father doing all right now , David ? " he asked me . <p> I nodded . After the Olans had moved in , their baby needed a doctor . My father had gone over , and on the way into the house , a brick had hit him in the back . It had knocked him down , but he 'd gotten up and gone inside anyway . That was two weeks ago , and I knew that my father going there , his speaking out against the attacks , his telling reporters that he was ashamed of the community , all this had to do with why Mrs. Nick had called me moneybags and not served me . <p> " Well , you tell him hello for me , " Officer Dennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so kind to me that I wanted to drag him back to Mrs. Nick 's and have him make her sell me a milkshake and my comic book . <p> I saw the curtains part and a little girl peek out the window ; then they were closed again , quickly . The house still had the name Stewart on the wood plaque that hung from the porch . The papers had said that the Stewarts , who had moved to Kennett Square , had been threatened for selling the house to Negroes . My father pored over the newspaper every day , shook his head , and mumbled angrily . " Like hostages , they 're kept inside like hostages , " he said one night at dinner . My mother sat in silence , not disagreeing , but not sharing his fury . She had never wanted to move into this neighborhood anyway . <p> At my house , Warren and I scuffed our sneakers against the flagstone steps . <p> " Want to come in ? " I said to Warren . He shook his head no ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His dad worked the graveyard shift at Sun Ship , and his mom worked late at Crozer hospital in the cafeteria . His sister and he fixed dinner for themselves at night . I looked up at the bedrooms of our house . My brother would be in his , my mother in hers . I did n't want to go in . " Maybe I could go home with you , " I said . <p> " Yeah , " said Warren , " ask . " <p> But I knew my mother would n't let me . She 'd be too afraid for me to be alone at Warren 's in the project at night , and I did n't want to make her any more anxious than she was already . Or unhappy . She 'd been " sad , " she told me , which meant she spent a lot of time alone in her room . <p> We lived across the street from a park , in the biggest , most conspicuously affluent home in Garden City , a three-story fieldstone Colonial with white shutters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that looked out on the park . My father had wanted to live here , a working-class section outside of Chester , a pocket among the more prosperous communities of Swarthmore , Rose Valley , and Wallingford , because he 'd found a piece of property across the street from the park and fallen in love with the location and the unpretentious neighborhood . But there were no Jews besides us , no one my mother socialized with , and my brother was regularly beaten up at school . I had done better , making friends , " passing , " and fitting in , except now for Mrs. Nick . I punched Warren in the arm , and he punched me back , and then I went inside . No sounds were in the house , just the ticking of the grandfather clock in the foyer . The living room , which we never used , enjoyed the last of the winter light coming into it through the picture window . My mother collected glass bottles displayed along the wide ledge under the window . My favorite was a translucent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening and spired top . I could n't explain it exactly , but the bottle looked desirable to me , I suppose I mean sexual , and I had sensations of excitement whenever I gazed at it . It was graceful and slender , an ice-blue color that shimmered in the morning light . The other bottles rose in height from either side toward the blue one in the middle , like the pipes of an organ . I went over and touched its tip , a frozen tear on top . <p> I heard a toilet flush upstairs , my parents ' bathroom . My brother , who was two years older than me , lay on his bed reading . His teacher , Mrs. Fitzsimmons , had sent a note home recommending that he not read so much . Adrian was spending his time at recess reading rather than playing kickball or baseball or getting fresh air . Mrs. Fitzsimmons believed he should involve himself more in physical activity and the company of his classmates . <p> " Hi , " I said , standing in his doorway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't like to build model airplanes and aircraft carriers . He did n't have baseball pennants on his walls as I did , or pictures of wild animals . Adrian had movie posters : Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times , Marlene Dietrich in Blue Angel , Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre . It was the other thing he did besides read , watch movies and pretend to make them . He spent a lot of time looking at me with his thumb up to his right eye . " Tracking shot , " he 'd say as I came out of the bathroom . Or he 'd cup his hands to his face : " Close-up . " It was annoying . I 'd lie in bed at night and wish Warren was my brother , or somebody like him . Adrian was heavysetthe term I 'd been told to use by my father-and kids at school called him swivel hips , because of the way he walked . He had one friend , Perry , who lived across town and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other term I 'd learned to describe Adrian 's unpopularity . I held my breath during every recess that Adrian would n't get picked on and beat up ( no doubt why he stayed inside and read ) . Unlike me , he did n't fight back , or even try to , nor did he have a protector like Warren . Adrian just lay there and covered his face with his arms and let them wallop him . He did n't cry or make a fuss afterward , and for that reason maybe nobody really tried to hurt him . It was just to humiliate him , pound on the fat boy , like a stop along an obstacle course . They 'd thump him a while and then go back to what they were doing , playing softball or using the swings or pitching pennies , and Adrian would stand up , brush himself off , and go find a book somewhere . <p> " Where 's Mom ? " I said . " In her room , " said Adrian . " You just get home ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Mrs. Nick , but I knew there was nothing he 'd say to help . What could you say when you were a whipping boy for the whole class ? <p> " Look at this , " he said , and pulled a long wooden box out from under his bed . <p> He opened the latches . It was a skeleton . " Where 'd you get that ? " I said , impressed . " Dad loaned it to me . It 's a teaching skeleton . " " What do you mean ? " <p> " They use it in medical school . This is a child , " he said , conspiratorially . " A child ? " <p> " About six years old . " <p> I reached out and touched the small skull . <p> " I 'm going to make a film with it , " said Adrian . He was squatting down as was I next to the skeleton , and I could see the rolls of fat under his T-shirt . His forehead had broken out in perspiration , his fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here before I came in , and then I realized it was just excitement , excitement about an idea . Nobody I knew at school got excited about ideas . Just Adrian . " What kind of movie ? " I asked . <p> " A horror film , " said Adrian . " I 'm writing the script , " and he nodded at the Royal typewriter on his desk . He 'd gotten it for his last birthday . " Buried Coccyx , " said Adrian . " What ? " <p> " That 's the title : ' " What 's it mean ? " Adrian shifted his hips with irritation . He was sitting on the bed , holding the skeleton in his lap . " It 's a mystery , stupid . The victims lose their coccyx . " " Their what ? " <p> " Their tailbones . The murderer cuts them off . He collects them like arrowheads " <p> I looked at the small skeleton . It was frail and delicate . " He does this to children ? " <p> Adrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part yet . I can make the skeleton look bigger on camera . " " Do you have a camera ? " <p> " Dad 's going to help me rent one . A sixteen millimeter . " Adrian tilted his head back and hooded his eyes . " I vill be zee greatest director of ze century ! I 'll find a part for you , " he added . " All right , " I said , and got up to go . " Where you going ? " " To see Mom . ' <p> Adrian shook his head . " She 's resting . " Resting . It could mean anything , but it probably meant she was " sad . ' " I 'll check on her anyway , " I said . <p> " Fade out , " called Adrian as I exited through his doorway . I went down the hall to my mother 's room . She was sitting by the window staring out . She was still in her nightgown , at fourthirty in the afternoon . " David , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the feeling she 'd been sitting here for hours . <p> " Hi , " I said , not going into her room too far , either . It smelled of sleep and unwashed sheets . My parents ' bed was still rumpled , the room unstraightened , clothes on the floor . Several bottles of pills that my father prescribed for her were on the nightstand . A round tray with a coffee cup and a plate with an uneaten roll caught the last of the afternoon light at the small table for two . <p> " Do you want your lunch ? " she asked . " Lunch ? " My mother stared at me , as if trying to remember . She closed her eyes and swallowed . " I mean , dinner . Dinner , David . " " Are you all right ? " I asked . <p> " I 'm fine , " she said . " You go play now . I 'll be down in a minute to fix dinner . " She turned away , and I felt my chest tighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child skeleton in the box under Adrian 's bed . <p> An hour later my father returned from his office , and the house came to life . He 'd been tied up with patients all day . He made us grilled cheese sandwiches and milkshakes . Mother joined us . She 'd gotten dressed , a blue sweater and a tan skirt , and she sat at the table with her cheek resting on one hand , smiling pleasantly . Everything would be all right . Everything was fine . We were a family . Dad was home . <p> Adrian ate one helping of chocolate cream pie for dessert , and when he asked for another , my mother gently turned him down . She picked up our plates and began to wash the dishes at the sink . Except for her having been upstairs all day , she was fine . Maybe she was just resting , after all . Tired . And I started to feel better . I did n't even mind after dinner when Adrian stood in our old Radio Flyer wagon and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room while he shouted , " Dolly shot ! Quiet on the set ! " Not long after I went to bed , I heard raised voices in my parents ' bedroom . I could make out my father saying something about keeping the house clean , and my mother answering she hated it here and she missed her sisters in New York and why had she ever agreed to move , and then my mother crying and my father saying , " Oh , for God 's sake " and leaving the bedroom . I got up to use the bathroom and saw that Adrian 's light was still on . He was typing . I thought about going in , but either he had been listening or he had n't been listening . Either way , like Warren and I with Mrs. Nick , we would n't talk about what was right in front of us . <p> Downstairs the phone rang , and I heard my father answer it and say , " Yes , " then a long pause . " How high is it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll be right over . " He came upstairs and saw me standing in the hallway . " Why are you still up , David ? " " I " Go to bed . Right now . " I glanced at Adrian 's door , as if to excuse my behavior by my brother 's , but my father did n't care . They never bothered Adrian . He stayed up all night , read and wrote and went to school and got straight A 's and that was Adrian . But me , I was going to be normal , sleep regular hours , have decent friends , make average grades , not be a budding , precious genius . Live a boy 's life . I hurried back into my room . <p> I could n't sleep , especially when I heard my parents raising their voices again . It was like a storm that never went away entirely , the thunder becoming distant enough that you forgot about it , but not for long . " Take your pill , " my father said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water running and then silence . I imagined my mother 's mouth opening submissively , my father placing the pill on her tongue and tipping her water glass up to her lips . Her swallowing mechanically . I do n't know for sure if that 's what happened or if she even took a pill that night , but I know sitting alone on my bed I felt her complete helplessness . <p> My father came out from their bedroom . He closed their door and stepped quietly down the stairs . The hall closet opened , then the front door . I heard him leave . <p> I ran to the window . He 'd parked the Buick on the street . We only had one car . Some families , some of the kids I knew from Hebrew school , the wealthier doctors , had two cars , but nobody in Garden City had a second car . <p> The headlights flickered on and off as he tried to start the car . Mother had been complaining about the battery for weeks now . I saw him get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . <p> There was something instinctive , if crazy , about what I did next . I pulled on my clothes and ran after him . I followed him down Chestnut Parkway onto Locust Lane . I knew by this time where he was going . He stepped so purposefully , with long determined strides , that it could n't be a regular house call . I ran across the winter lawns trying to keep up . Once , he stopped and looked around when he heard me , but I had already ducked down behind the McClearys ' wheelbarrow that always stayed in their cluttered front yard . When he turned from Hastings onto Rynard Road , I saw the Olans ' house . <p> I was surprised to see no policeman patrolling out front , but then I 'd never been here this late . <p> Still , though , there were floodlights on the lawn , and the house was lit up like a stage . My father went up the front walk , the same walk where a brick two weeks earlier had knocked him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my father disappeared inside . <p> What to do ? I could go home . Wearing just a flannel shirt , I was starting to freeze . But I had n't come all this way only to fade back into my own home . Well , I did n't want to escape . My nature was too curious to let me turn away . My mother 's " sadness " terrified me , that I might catch it , or some form of it , which perhaps Adrian , sitting at his typewriter , had already contracted . I wanted to follow my father into his world . <p> I was standing in the yard adjacent to the Olans ' , the Wileys : Mrs. Wiley worked at the school as a dietitian , and her husband was in maintenance . My father had read us Mrs. Wiley 's comment to The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin : " Nothing yet has convinced us they wo n't make good neighbors . " It was less forceful than my father 's comment that the neighborhood was holding this family hostage , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and why Mrs. Nick would n't serve me . In some way , I 'd wished he had n't spoken out . I 'd worked so hard to be like the other kids in my school . My hair , curly like my father 's , I kept short now . I wore lavender hi-boy shirts and stuck a greasy black comb in my back pocket . I had rat-stabber shoes from Flagg Brothers , and I said " That 's boss " as often as I could work it into a sentence . Meanwhile , the kids with whom I went to Hebrew school and who lived across the township line looked and dressed like the young lawyers most of them would eventually become . They wore Arrow shirts and khaki slacks , navy turtlenecks and corduroy sport coats with green suede patches on the elbows . Their hair , wavy and dark and Semitic like mine , was parted down the left side in a clean white scalp line . At Hebrew school I studied about everybody from Theodor Herzl to Hank Greenberg , and when I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and my heritage didn't-and never hadexisted . <p> I was fascinated by the Olans , because they 'd tried to break into the new neighborhood , as we had , and because they were having an even harder time than we did . When I stood on a milk crate under their back window , I had only wanted a glimpse of ourselves in the extreme . Their kitchen , tidy , clean , had the same Formica breakfast table as ours , a light blue oval with a large toaster on it . Right below my nose , under the window , was a wash sink filled with soaking clothes . I was amazed , given everything that was happening to them , that the Olans could carry on with life inside . Suddenly my shoulders were grabbed from behind , and I was yanked backwards . Two seconds later I was flat on my back on the cold grass with a flashlight shining in my eyes . I could see through the glare that it was a policeman , and that he was from Garden City . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or young compared to Officer Dennis , who would have understood why I was here and to whom I could have explained my curiosity . <p> " I 'm just looking , " I said . <p> " You 're just looking for trouble ; ' he said . " Now get out of here . " But at that moment the back door opened , and Officer Dennis , who was indeed inside and had come out to see what all the commotion was about , saw me and said , " David ? " " Yes , sir , " I said . <p> " Bring him inside , Tim , " he told the officer . <p> And I wound up at the Olans ' kitchen table . Mrs. Olan had just made a pot of coffee . She was a tall , thin woman with glistening black hair and long , lanky arms that seemed to be in every place at one time . She brought me milk and cookies and put her hand warmly on the back of my head , and I missed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me or held me much in the last year , and it seemed she was always wringing her hands or looking at me too anxiously for me to want her to touch me . <p> Mrs. Olan , though , had been crying . Her eyes were red , and against her dark skin they looked fiery . Mr. Olan came into the kitchen with his head down , saw me , and blinked hard . " He 's Dr. Pete 's boy , " explained Mrs. Olan . Mr. Olan nodded at me , and I said , " Hello , sir , " as I 'd been trained to do . Officer Dennis leaned back against the kitchen counter , sipping the coffee Mrs. Olan had made . Everyone was quiet in the kitchen , and when Mrs. Olan sat down at the blue Formica table , Mr. Olan came over and patted her shoulder , and she took his hand and pressed her face against his palm . " She sleeping now , " Mr. Olan said . Officer Dennis looked down at his coffee cup . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighbors hating these people . Something at the center of their lives that mattered more and was less comprehensible than any forces outside their home . <p> I put down the chocolate chip cookie . They were homemade and tasted delicious , but I thought it was insensitive to be gobbling cookies and gulping milk right now . <p> I heard footsteps down the stairs , and my father came into the kitchen with his black doctor 's bag . His face was pale and the shadows deep around his eyes . He had sharp , handsome features and dark curls , and people had said he reminded them of Tony Curtis , but he looked worn down , sunken and dented like my old basketball in the garage . When he saw me , it startled him , but only momentarily . So thick was his distress that even my inexplicable presence here could n't jar him from his heaviness . He turned to the Olans . " The ambulance will be here soon , " he told them , and Mrs. Olan put her hands up to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I carried his black doctor 's bag . I felt immensely important to be at his side . He did n't ask me what I was doing at the Olans ' house . If anything , he seemed glad for the company on the long walk home , much longer than it had taken either of us to get here . He said that he wished the baby had n't been allergic to penicillin , and that he should have made the decision earlier to put the child in the hospital , but he did n't want to split up the family . " Under the circumstances , David , " he told me , although it was as if he were talking to himself . <p> Two hours later I heard sirens going by our house , then more sirens . I heard my father run downstairs , followed by my mother . My father woke up our next-door neighbor , Mr. Phillips , for a ride to the Olans ' The fire that had been set would destroy the Olans ' garage and most of their kitchen . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out-was that the Olans had n't been at home . They 'd gone with their baby to the hospital , bringing along the two younger children asleep in their pajamas . <p> But the Olans ' baby had passed away during the night : I could n't bring myself to say " died " for a long while , because it was just the same as with my mother 's " sadness , " a soft phrase that let everybody , including me , off the hook . They had lost their baby and they 'd lost their house in the same night . Smoke damage would make the place uninhabitable , and they 'd soon leave , surrender and move to Darby . The neighborhood , which would not become integrated for twenty-one years , would never quite recover from it , as I would never recover from that day Mrs. Nick did n't serve me , and I allowed myself to slink away . The next year was 196o , and Warren and his family would move away , my mother would be hospitalized for depression , Adrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the park from our garage roof with his rented sixteen-millimeter camera , and I would decide I was going to be a doctor , a good doctor like my father , part of the great chain of cause and effect . <p>
