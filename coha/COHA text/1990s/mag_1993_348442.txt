EXHIBIT : WIFREDO LAM AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES , 1938-1952 <P> WHERE : THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM , NEW YORK CITY <P> WHAT : 121 PAINTINGS , BOOKS AND OTHER OBJECTS <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : The Cuban artist built a bridge between the Caribbean and the avant-gardes of Paris and New York . <P> If you are intrigued by artists who , instead of ensconcing themselves securely in one frame of cultural reference , work at the interface of several , then you ca n't help feeling curious about Wifredo Lam . Lam died 11 years ago , after a lifetime spent moving between Paris , New York City and his native Cuba . But his work has rarely been shown in the past 20 years , and he is often treated as a peripheral figure on the margins of Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism . <P> He was much more than that . Wifredo Lam and His Contemporaries , 1938-1952 , at the Studio Museum in Harlem  --  the 25th anniversary show of that battling , indispensable institution  --  offers a rare chance to see his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything like one : it leaves out Lam 's youth and age and concentrates only on his middle years , especially those spent in Cuba . Its object is to sketch the kind of relations Lam set up between his Afro-Cuban heritage , the work of other Cuban artists , and the avant-gardes ( the word still meant something in the ' 40s ) of Paris and New ) York . Its catalog , with essays by Kinshasha Holman Conwill , Lowery Stokes Sims and others , does a fine job of explicating the roots and routes of this border crosser 's life . <P> Lam 's ancestry might have been invented to demonstrate the remark of the Brazilian novelist Jorge Amado : Mestizaje es grandeza ( Mixture is greatness ) . Lam 's father was Chinese , his mother the daughter of a slave from the Congo . ( Spain did not abandon slavery in its Caribbean colonies until 1886 . ) He grew up hearing African languages spoken all around him , and his godmother was a priestess of a Santeria cult , a hybrid form of Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he went to Europe in 1923 ; presently he came to know Picasso ( whose work strongly influenced him ) and the Surrealists , who took him in as a member of their group . Another black painter who knew him in Paris claimed that Lam " forged the link between African sensibility and European tradition , " and he was n't exaggerating much . But in 1941 , correctly surmising that a black Surrealist who had fought on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War would have a short future under the Nazi occupation of France , Lam returned to Cuba ; from there , his work became a cultural bridge between the Caribbean and New York . <P> Lam was n't by any means the only Latin American painter to make a mark in the Manhattan avant-garde of the ' 40s , but to see his place one needs to remember that the New York School of the ' 40s was not the exclusive pantheon of half a dozen Abstract Expressionist heroes that later critics and dealers made it seem . It was open and eclectic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures  --  particularly those of Latin America  --  than it would be 25 years later . Lam had a strong common interest with American painters who became his friends , such as Arshile Gorky , Jackson Pollock and Robert Motherwell : namely a fascination with totemism and the imagery of ritual .
