<p> The same political enthusiasts who brought the Reagan revolution to Washington in 1981 are now inciting similar revolutions across the country , using ideas as their ammunition and a network of influential think tanks as their weapon . <p> In a little-noticed trend , dozens of small policy institutes devoted to free markets , small government and individual " empowerment " have set up shop during the past few years to promote such goals as tax limitation , privatization and school choice at the state and local levels . From California to Massachusetts , they are having a significant impact on the way millions of Americans are governed . <p> The development was spawned by the Reagan-era emphasis on shifting authority from the central government to the states and is fueled by the disenchantment of conservatives and libertarians with the Bush administration 's cautious , reactive approach to domestic policy . <p> " These think tanks are proliferating as power and decision- making drift to the state and local level , " said John Carlson , a former Reagan administration functionary who heads the Washington Institute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give ideas life , nourish them at the grass roots , and push them up to the federal level . " <p> Faced with mounting social problems and tight budgets , state lawmakers are hungry for inno vative policies offered by the new idea merchants , said David Osborne , an adviser to Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton and author of the forthcoming book , " Reinventing Government . " <p> " There are lots of strange bedfellows and unusual ideological alliances forming as people search for something that works , " he said . <p> The narrow focus of most leftist policy groups on the national level has left the statehouses wide open to conservatives and libertarians , said Linda Tarr-Whelan , head of the liberal Center for Policy Alternatives in Washington . <p> NATIONWIDE TREND <p> Free-market advocates still view themselves as an embattled minority , but their books , pamphlets , op-ed articles and public forums are spreading the message across the country : <p> * The Mackinac Center in Midland , Mich. , which opened its doors in 1988 , supplied the intellectual blueprint for Republican Governor John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national reputation by wiping out the state 's deficit without raising taxes . <p> Overseeing many of his budget and regulatory reforms are former center staff members who now occupy senior positions in the treasury and budget departments and on commissions for the arts and civil rights . The center recently distributed more than 50,000 copies of its book " Michigan : Agenda for the ' 90s , " and generated more than 400 news stories last year on its proposals . <p> * The Chicago-based Heartland Institute , which has branch offices in Detroit , Cleveland , Kansas City , St. Louis and Milwaukee , was founded in 1984 and focuses on tax policy , education and health care reform and privatization . Its president , Joseph Bast , takes credit for helping to deregulate taxi service in Chicago , block a state health insurance plan in Wisconsin and earn Chicago Mayor Richard Daley 's enthusiastic support for the concept of school choice . <p> * The Manhattan Institute in New York has won a national reputation for work in the areas of welfare reform and reform of civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff members from East Harlem to implement school choice , sponsors a journal on New York 's urban problems and has just organized a project to study reforms in cities across America . <p> THINK TANKS IN S.F. <p> California has its own share of active , free-market think tanks . Two of them  --  the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy and the Institute for Contemporary Studies  --  are based incongruously in San Francisco , a bastion of liberalism . <p> Both have recently stepped up their work on state and local issues . The Institute for Contemporary Studies , which once made its mark publishing weighty tomes on supply-side economics and defense strategy , just founded the Citizens Alliance for Community Empowerment in San Francisco , to help public housing tenants manage and ultimately buy their own units . <p> " What a lot of us learned after eight years of Reagan is we did n't get far with social issues because you have to push them at the local level , " said its president , Robert Hawkins , Jr. , who once served with Governor Ronald Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting from academic policy analysis to more hands-on involvement with state issues , under its new president , Sally Pipes , who headed a similar think tank in Vancouver . " A lot of things that become policy at the national level start in California , " she said . " We think we can have more influence on the state level and use it to influence Washington . " <p> Next week , Pacific will announce its new " Efficiency in Government " prize for " tangible , workable solutions " to the state 's financial woes . Governor Wilson has already endorsed the program . A similar prize offered by the Pioneer Institute in Boston last year generated a wealth of ideas for Massachusetts Governor William Weld . <p> MIXED RECORD <p> The record of California 's free- market think tanks is mixed , in part because the liberal , Democratic-controlled Legislature has been cool to their ideas . <p> But work published by Pacific in the early 1980s on water marketing is now widely endorsed as a prescription for the state 's water crisis . And the Reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privatization , helped persuade the state to experiment with privately financed toll roads . <p> " More and more legislators at the state level are using research reports from these institutes as part of their argumentation on policy issues up here , " said Robert McKenzie , staff director for the state Senate Republican Caucus . <p> Mark Davis , director of writing and research in the Wilson administration , said he has been in close contact with two other free-market institutes , the Claremont Institute in Sacramento and the Hoover Institution at Stanford . " The whole group is a positive resource , " he said . <p> Conservative think tanks became a national sensation when the Heritage Foundation in Washington emerged in 1981 as the ideological mouthpiece of the Reagan administration . Heritage 's massive policy compendium , Mandate for Leadership , became a blueprint for Reagan 's economic , social and defense agenda . <p> Even as it basked in Washington glory , however , Heritage started an outreach program by guiding fledgling local think tanks to sources of financing , policy expertise and administrative know-how . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Madison Hotel in Washington to set up an independent network to share ideas and strategies . Today , the so- called Madison Group has more than 70 cooperating organizations across the country . <p> " The left is far behind , " said Robert Bothwell , head of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy , which promotes a progressive agenda . " We were able to identify only three state- level think tanks that were liberal to progressive . " <p> But he said the competition among ideas is not a simple left- right struggle . " Some of the issues ( the free-market institutes ) raise are good issues , " he said . For example , Bothwell himself , along with other liberals , promoted school vouchers long before Presidents Reagan and Bush began touting them . " Educational choice is not necessarily conservative , even though they took it and ran with it , " he said .
