Que onda ? That question , or its English equivalent  --  What 's going on ?  --  is being asked throughout Mexico , in Washington and on Wall Street . Is the Mexican government at war or peace with rebels in the southern state of Chiapas ? Does the governing party 's electoral defeat in Mexico 's second biggest city , Guadalajara , and in the state of Jalisco portend a loss of political control or a heartening turn toward genuine democracy  --  or maybe both ? Most important , does Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon , less than three months into his six-year term , have a consistent strategy for dealing with political and financial crises , or is he just grasping at straws ? <P> Right now it would be hard to make a case for consistency . Only five days after sending troops and tanks to occupy 18 villages in Chiapas that had been controlled by Zapatista rebels , Zedillo abruptly called off the offensive . He ordered the soldiers to do nothing that might lead to shooting , suspended efforts to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be issued and offered the Zapatistas amnesty and political negotiations if they would lay down their arms . He even went along with one of the rebels ' prime demands : the resignation of Chiapas Governor Eduardo Robledo , who the Zapatistas contend had won his post in a fraudulent election . <P> The government claimed that the offensive successfully reasserted its authority throughout the region . Indeed , in Guadalupe Tepeyac , where the Zapatista leader who calls himself Subcomandante Marcos made his headquarters most of last year , a garrison of 20 soldiers did seem to be in command  --  but in command of a ghost town . Elsewhere too , Zapatistas were neither fighting nor giving up but melting away into the jungle , sometimes with families in tow . As a car carrying two journalists approached the village of Oventik , 20 men who had been hoeing at the ground ran into their huts , grabbed clothes , firewood and babies and , with their women , fled into the brush . Within minutes most of the 32 families had disappeared without a trace . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the same vanishing act four times previously when soldiers appeared . <P> In Chiapas a Zapatista calling herself Major Ana Maria read to Mexican reporters a communique , supposedly from Marcos , that said the Zapatistas were willing to negotiate , but it is necessary that the government takes out its troops first . ' ' Government officials , relying on information from a defector known as Subcomandante Daniel , who is being held in a maximum-security prison near Mexico City , insist that the movement is made up of a mere 130 professionals ' ' and 500 militiamen and is being torn by dissension over Marcos ' allegedly authoritarian ways . If encircled and forced to hide in the jungle long enough , military planners think , disheartened Zapatistas will give up and negotiate . Maybe , but at week 's end there were no negotiations , though the army had clearly dug in for a long stay in previously held rebel villages . It 's a scrambled policy , ' ' said a Western diplomat .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
