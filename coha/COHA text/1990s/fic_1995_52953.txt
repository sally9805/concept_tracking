It 's a long haul from practically anywhere to Chincoteague : a barrier island off the eastern shore of Virginia , it 's completely inaccessible by train , and the nearest major airports are hours away  --  in Baltimore , or Washington . I left Atlanta at eight A.M. Thursday morning , arrived in D.C. a little after ten , and was on the road by eleven : across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge , stop-and-go through a numbing procession of small dull towns , lunch a burger at Hardees , then back behind the wheel . The little Ford Escort weathered the journey better than I did : by the time I finally crossed Wallops Island into Chincoteague , I felt hot , tired , irritable  --  same as I 'd felt twenty years before , when my parents , in the throes of the marriage spasms which would ultimately end in divorce , brought me here for my first summer with Uncle Evan and Aunt Dierdre . <p> But the minute I started across the Black Narrows Bridge  --  the moment I drew my first breath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heron loping casually through the marshland below  --  my fatigue and irritation receded like a tide , and the memory of two glorious summers came back in a rush , etched brightly onto everything I saw . <p> I had n't been here in almost five years , but in many ways the town did n't look all that different than it had even twenty years ago . There was still only one stoplight on Main Street , and the town dock remained sleepy to the point of narcolepsy . Gone were the neighborhood stores known only by their owners ' names  --  Dave Birch 's store ; Charlie Gold 's store  --  but the storefronts along Main were still small , mom-and-pop operations , not a single tri-level , escalatored shopping mall anywhere to be seen . Further south ( or " down the marsh , " as they said here ) one-story bungalows with screened-in porches fronted the tidal flat ; kids drove five-speeds across neatly mowed lawns ; out on the channel , motorboats traced foam contrails in the water . <p> It was so much like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what brought me here ; for a moment , as I pulled into the driveway of the white clapboard house on Margarets Lane , I half-expected to see the tall , rangy figure of Uncle Evan ambling out of the house to greet me . <p> But it was Aunt Dierdre  --  heavy-set , middling height , white-haired - who appeared on the front steps as I pulled my travel bag from the trunk , and she was alone . <p> " Steven ? You came  --  " <p> Though she did n't intend them to , the words cut deep : You came . For too long I had n't come . For the five years I 'd been married to Rose , I 'd been too busy with my own life  --  had only spoken to Dee and Evan by phone , the occasional holiday call . And now Evan was gone , and it was too late to make up for the lost time between us , to make amends for my thoughtlessness . <p> Maybe I could make amends to Dierdre , at least . As she approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " How you holding up , Aunt Dee ? " <p> I could read the pain in her eyes , but she shrugged in a way she shared with many residents of this fragile island : a stoic acceptance of the sort of calamities  --  floods , hurricanes , fires  --  which had always been part of life on Chincoteague . " Better , " she said , trying for a smile , " now that you 're here . But come on , come in , let me take that . " Faster than the eye could follow she 'd grabbed my travel bag and was bustling into the house  --  happy , I suspect , to have someone to look after again . <p> Both Aunt Dee and Uncle Evan were " Teaguers "  --  island natives . ( Non-natives , even long-time residents who were n't born here , were invariably known as " come-heres " or " come-latelys . " ) My mother left Chincoteague for college and , after that , Baltimore , but her brother Evan stayed behind , becoming a " waterman " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dierdre . They were never able to have children of their own , which could account for why they so readily agreed to play host to a surly , restless ten-year-old city brat . <p> " You were a handful , " she admitted , half an hour later , over cake and coffee . " But you settled down soon enough . " <p> I smiled . " Yeah . But only after hijacking Uncle Evan 's skiff . " By the end of my first week on Chincoteague I 'd contracted a near-terminal case of island fever ; bored out of my mind , I liberated a small dinghy Evan had been restoring in his back yard , launched it ( not without a skinned knee ) into the channel , and tried  --  insane as it may sound , in retrospect  --  to paddle back to the mainland . <p> Dierdre laughed , eyes bright for the first time since I 'd seen her . " When he found out what you 'd done , I thought he was going to shellac your behind , but good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd made it all the way to Willis Point , he told me , ' Dierdre , the boy may have the makin 's of a waterman , ' and after that , you could do no wrong , even when you did . " <p> " Maybe I should have listened to him , " I said . " There are days when trawling for flounder off Tom 's Cove sounds a lot more appealing than putting out a trade magazine . " <p> " Oh no , " she said quickly , " it was hard work , Steven , a hard way to make a living . He loved it , but I think you have to love it , to keep at it , year in and year out . " <p> I hesitated a moment . " Where . . . was he ? " I said , finally broaching the subject we had so far avoided . " When it happened ? " <p> Her eyes clouded over . " Right there , " she said , nodding to the old leather recliner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the month before , but we really had no idea . No warning . " She looked down . " I know the Lord has His reasons , but . . . I must admit , I 'm hard-pressed to see how He could need Evan more than I do . " <p> I looked at the chair in which he 'd spent his last moments , and felt an odd anger , a vague sense of . . . injustice . It must have showed on my face , because Dierdre just nodded sadly . " He should have been out there when it came , " she said , glancing toward the waters of the bay . " It would 've been awful for me  --  his boat being late ; the search  --  but even so . He loved the water ; loved the sea . That was where he should 're passed on . . . not in some fatty old chair in his living room . Out there , in his element . " <p> I did n't want to go see him ; did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was real , whether I wanted it to be or not . And so , too soon , we were in Salyers Funeral Home , and I was gazing down at Evan  --  at his creased , craggy face ; at his big hands , calloused from years of dragging nets and shucking oysters ; at his scarecrow-thin body laid out in a simple black suit  --  and my memories truly became memories , then . Until that moment , I could pretend that I could come back here . . . join him for an afternoon on his boat . . . go wading for clams with him . Now all that belonged irrevocably , and only , to the past . <p> The satin lining of the casket , the crushed velvet pillow on which his head lay  --  Evan would have snorted derisively at them . A little too frou-frou for me , he would 've said  --  and it was then I remembered something he 'd once told me . I turned to Aunt Dierdre . " Did n't Uncle Evan want to be cremated ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay ? " <p> Dierdre looked embarrassed ; almost guilty . " I. . . I just could n't , Steven , " she said quietly . " It seems so . . . final . I want a place I can go to , to visit him . He was out there , on the water , for so much of our life together . . . I 'd like him near me , now , for as long as I have left . " She looked away . " Is that selfish of me ? " <p> I shook my head , and did n't protest . <p> What would have happened , I wonder , if I had ? <p> The funeral was scheduled for the next day . I made dinner reservations for seven o'clock at the Village Restaurant for Aunt Dee and myself ; that left me with an hour or so of free time . Stiff and sore from the long drive , I decided to take a swim on Assateague , another barrier island  --  and wildlife refuge  --  due east of Chincoteague . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , but this was mid-September , and though the ocean was still warm , the beach was only sparsely populated , particularly this late in the day . I laid my towel and car keys on a sand dune , peeled off my T-shirt , and dove into the water  --  limbering up with a few kicks , then swimming parallel to the shore for about ten minutes before flipping over on my back and floating there in the waning sun . <p> As I floated , the sun a red mist beyond my shut eyelids , I felt the slow , languid pace of life here take hold again . . . my thoughts drifting back to the ways I used to pass the time , things I had n't done in twenty years . ' Signing ' for clams  --  poking a long , two-pronged stick into the tiny keyholes in the sand where innocent shellfish fell to my youthful appetite . Rashly trying to pet the wild ponies which ran free here on Assateague ( and narrowly avoiding being kicked in the head by one particularly testy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spot and name all manner of animals and birds unknown in the city : heron , ibis , deer , tree frogs , geese . . . <p> The water gently rocked me back and forth , tiny waves tickling the backs of my legs , elbows , neck . I was wearing a loose-fitting swimsuit ; the water flowed through it , seeming almost to caress me with each rolling motion of the surf . I smiled , remembering the times I 'd skinny-dipped here as a boy . I lay there , feeling happy and oddly aroused , the touch of the waters feeling almost like that of a human hand  --  <p> A hand which now , slowly and gently , began to . . . stroke . . . my genitals . . . <p> Startled , I yelped , kicked out of my floating position , tugged on the waistband of my shorts and peered inside , looking for . . . what ? <p> Of course , there was nothing there . I laughed , embarrassed : Helluva riptide . And in fact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from shore . I paddled back to the beach , toweled off , and went back to Chincoteague for dinner . <p> The funeral was well-attended ; the island , even now , is a tight-knit community , and Evan was particularly well-loved . A few of his fellow watermen spoke of their days together on the island , before the bridge was built connecting it to the mainland  --  back when boats were more than a livelihood , they were the life 's blood of the community . His best friend , Ben Sanders , who owned the Channel Inn , said a few words . The minister read from Psalms . And that was about it . <p> We buried him in a small cemetery about a quarter-mile down Church Street , and I threw the first handful of dirt onto the coffin , saying good-bye to the uncle I had cared so much for  --  the uncle who , with his wife , had showed me that men and women could love each other , that people could make a safe place for themselves in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I took pride in the fact that it was a quick , amicable parting , nothing like the pitched battles my parents engaged in for so long ; and I like to think I had Evan and Dierdre in part to thank for that . <p> When Aunt Dierdre asked me to stay the weekend , I agreed gladly  --  as much to assuage my guilt over my long absence as to comfort her . When she suggested I take Uncle Evan 's boat , the Sea Breeze , out onto the channel , I was both surprised and flattered . She knew how much I loved the old tub , and knew as well that I had never piloted her without Evan at my side . I protested ( not very strongly , I admit ) that it had been at least six years since I 'd been at the helm , but she dismissed that with a wave . " Your uncle thought you 'd make a good waterman , " she said . " That 's good enough for me . " <p> The Sea Breeze was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hull , green trim similarly chipping off oak railings . Its deck was scuffed , and mottled with thirty years ' accretion of fish oils , but the moment I stepped into the small pilot house and took the wheel in my hands , I might as well have been at the helm of a luxury liner . The old diesel engine wheezed like an asthmatic at first , then settled into a steady ( if somewhat tubercular ) drone . I cast off , maneuvered the boat away from the town dock , and headed out into the channel . <p> The channel was n't too crowded  --  one or two fishing boats , a half dozen speedboats . I glided past pilings and buoys , veered to port as I approached Chincoteague Point , then guided her slowly into the waters of Tom 's Cove . <p> After about fifteen minutes I cut the engine and let her drift for a while , as I stood by the railing and gazed into the misty distance . Waves slapped gently against the creaking hull , lulling me into remembrance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that out here , on the water we both shared  --  the water he introduced me to  --  I would say my true good-bye to Uncle Evan ; but it was n't meant to be . <p> As I stood there , all fuzzy-headed and sentimental , I suddenly felt a huge jolt , the Sea Breeze shuddering beneath me . Rudely propelled out of my daydreaming , I noticed at once that the gentle rocking of the boat had ceased ; it was essentially immobile . And that could only mean one thing . I hurried forward and looked out at what should have been the waters of the cove . <p> An oval of sand extended outward for a good ten yards ahead of the Sea Breeze 's bow . <p> Damn ! <p> I felt mortified . Aground on a sandbar ; Uncle Evan would never have allowed this to happen . I told myself that this happened to the best of sailors , particularly here in Chincoteague where sandbars appeared and disappeared like cards in a magician 's deck ; but I still hoped to hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clumsy nephew , first time out of the box , had managed to beach his beloved Sea Breeze on a spit of sand . <p> Luckily I knew what to do . Well , no luck involved , actually  --  Evan had drummed it into me . I slipped off my sandals and climbed over the side of the boat , onto the sandbar . <p> Rather than immediately trying to push the boat off  --  the most common mistake you could make  --  I started to pace out the sandbar : that is , walk straight away from the boat in every direction until I began to hit deep water , so I knew in which direction to push the boat . I walked twenty paces south ; there was a slow dropoff before I found myself up to my waist in water . I backed up , then went twenty feet to the west ; a steeper dropoff this time . That might be the best bet . Still , to be sure , I headed twenty paces due east . <p> Only moments after my feet entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer dropoff . <p> I bobbed to the surface , started to swim the two feet back to the sandbar  --  but something stopped me . Almost as though I 'd hit a wall , or a reef . . . yet there was nothing in front of me but water . I felt a brief surge of panic , then calmly turned in the water , figuring to swim around to the other side of the sandbar , the part I knew had a slow dropoff . <p> Something stopped me again . <p> But this time , it was n't like a wall . It was like being held back . <p> Heart pounding I looked down , terrified I might find a Great White circling below me. . . but there was nothing there . <p> Nothing . . . <p> That terrified me more than a shark would have . I flailed my arms , trying to move in any direction at all , but suddenly I could get no purchase at all on the water  --  could n't move more than an inch or two in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . . . and realized it made no difference whether my legs kicked or not . I was being . . . upheld , somehow . And the grip  --  there was no other word for it  --  seemed suddenly familiar . It was a gentle grip , firm but not creel ; in fact just the opposite . I could feel the water beneath me swirling and flowing around my legs , like fingers tracing spirals up my calves , my knees , my thighs . Beneath my cut-offs I was wearing only a swim support , and now the water seemed to press against my groin , caressing the bulge of my cock , making little tugs at the cotton fabric . The fingers of water ran up my stomach , teasingly , swirling and tugging at my chest hair , massaging my ribs , my pectorals , my shoulders . . . <p> My shoulders ! I realized with a start that they were under water now . The hands , the water , whatever the hell it was , was pulling me under . I screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dragging me down , the water lapping at my chin , my lips  --  <p> I took a deep breath just moments before my head was dragged under the waves . What the hell was happening ? Who are you , I wanted to scream , why are you doing this to me  --  <p> I opened my eyes . The salt stung them , but I saw nothing in front of me ; nothing but water . My heart hammered in my chest . I knew I had only thirty , forty seconds before my air ran out ; I had to do something . But what ? How ? <p> I kicked furiously , but remained rooted in place . <p> I felt something press against my lips . Cold . Wet . Strangely soft . <p> It was trying to force my mouth open . I resisted with all my strength , but it  --  whatever the hell it was  --  was stronger . And as my mouth began to open , I suddenly recognized what was pressed against my lips . <p> Another pair of lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearing the intake of water into my lungs . . . but it never came . I tasted a salt kiss against my open mouth . . . but I could breathe . Almost as though I were somehow drawing the oxygen directly from the water itself . <p> As soon as I realized I was not going to die . . . as I understood that this force , whatever it was , did not mean to kill me , or even harm me . . . I relaxed a bit . And in that moment of relaxation , I could suddenly appreciate the pleasurable aspects of what was happening to me : the caresses to my body , the gentle eddies of water around my penis . . . and with my fear ebbing , I could even feel myself getting hard . My God , it was true : Given half a chance , men would fuck almost anything ! <p> The thought made me laugh , and as my mouth opened further I felt a tongue of water gently dart inside . Salty and a little coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it licked at my own tongue , teased it . . . and I found myself reciprocating . The very perversity of what was happening began to arouse me . I was n't going to die ; I might as well enjoy whatever was happening . Tentatively my tongue explored these strange , liquid lips pressed against mine , cold and wet and somehow thrilling . They tasted of salt and brine and everything I loved about the sea . I was half aware of something inside my shorts , fingers of water gripping the shaft of my penis , moving easily from the base of the shaft to the tip , briefly stroking the foreskin , just long enough to bring me close to orgasm and then back down the shaft again , a gentle squeeze to my testicles , then up again , faster now , back and forth  --  <p> I came , and the ocean closed tight and warm around me , and the next thing I knew I was bobbing to the surface , free . <p> And alone . That much I knew at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swam to the sandbar and lay there a good five minutes , trying to make sense of what had just happened - and failing miserably . It was n't a delusion , that much I knew ; but I could think of no rational explanation for the forces which had taken me ( in every sense of the term ! ) . After five minutes , I looked around me and saw that the sandbar had shrunk to half its size , and that the Sea Breeze was afloat once more . I took a deep breath and got to my feet . <p> I clambered back into the boat ; its gentle rocking felt soothing , reassuring . I noticed the deck was wet ; apparently , while I was gone , a large wave had dumped over the stem , spilling water and seaweed across the deck . It took me a moment before I realized there was something unusual about the seaweed . <p> Strands of the seaweed were arranged like letters on the oak planks . A strand that looked like a tuning fork was a y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same circle formed a u . . . <p> I shivered despite the heat , as I took in the entirety of the message which lay at my feet . <p> It said , You taste like him . <p> I guided the ship back to shore , tied her up at the dock , and got as far away from the water as I possibly could , retreating inland for lunch . I purposely did n't order a drink , as badly as I needed one , trying to keep my jumbled thoughts and emotions in some pathetic approximation of order . My whole world had turned upside down  --  in more ways than one . <p> I was terrified to go back out on the water . Afraid not for my life - whatever was out there could easily have killed me , had it desired  --  but of my own response to what had happened . Afraid of it happening again ; afraid of wanting it to happen again . If the waters could assume the shapes they had , I wondered , what other forms could they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of me never wanted to know . <p> But what really obsessed me was the message on the deck , and all that it implied . I did n't know how to answer the thousand questions that were boiling up in me . I was n't about to tell anybody what had happened  --  was n't about to even allude to it . And the questions I was beginning to ask about Uncle Evan were hardly ones I could put to Aunt Dierdre , even in veiled form . <p> There was only one person I could think to approach . <p> The Channel Inn , a quaint little bed-and-breakfast fronting Main Street , occupied a small but choice plot of land with a fine view of the channel and the marshes beyond . Still spry at seventy-two , Ben Sanders dragged over a white , wood-slatted chaise longue for me to sit in . " Whoops . Hold on , " and before I could sit he whisked a rag across the back of the chaise . " Gulls , " he spat out . " If I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these chairs . . . Iced tea ? " <p> " Sure , thanks . " <p> He poured me a tall glass from an old-fashioned pitcher ; handed it to me , then settled down in a chair opposite . " Ahh , " he sighed , " I ca n't believe he 's gone , can you ? " <p> Ben and Evan had been best friends since they met in grade school , sixty years ago ; they had played stickball together , wooed girls together , gone fishing together , for the better part of six decades . Now Ben squinted into the distance , toward the channel . " So , " he said , " you took the Sea Breeze out for a spin today , did you ? " <p> I said that I had . <p> He shook his head . " It was a fine boat in its time , do n't get me wrong , but . . . you must admit , her engines have seen better days . " I laughed . " Every Friday morning at eight A.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rickety old scow past my bedroom window , ' cause he knew it drove me crazy . Not Tuesday mornings , not Wednesday mornings , not Sunday mornings . Friday mornings . Eight A.M. For thirty years . Ornery old son of a bitch . " <p> He paused . It was quiet on the channel . Ben looked pained . <p> I waited a moment , then said , " He took the boat out a lot ? Even after he 'd retired ? " <p> Ben nodded . " Six days out of seven . He may have stopped fishing for a living , but he just could n't help himself . He 'd go out , maybe catch a few pounds of bluefish , some black drum  --  give me some for my dining room , and Mrs. Brattie down at the Islander , and take home the rest . " <p> " He fished every day ? " <p> " Well , not every day , I reckon . Sometimes he 'd just anchor her off Tom 's Cove , or Assateague Beach , and spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever . " <p> " She never says as much , " I said , " but I think it might 've been hard on Dierdre , having him away so much of the time . " <p> Ben nodded . " I imagine it was . But he was an odd one , that Evan . Knew him fifty years  --  we played chess here every Thursday ; went bowling every Saturday night ; he and Dierdre came over for dinner every other Sunday . And for all that , there was still a part of him Evan kept to himself . Sometimes he 'd look into the distance , and I did n't know what the hell he was seeing . I 'd ask him , ' What 's on that fevered little brain of yours , Ev ? ' and he 'd just smile and say something like , ' Is n't the world an amazing place , Ben ? ' and I 'd agree , yeah , the world could be pretty amazing , and that was it . I swear , that was all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goddamned conundrum , at times . " <p> I tried to keep my tone measured . " Do you think he might have been . . . that is , there might have been someone  --  " <p> Ben looked at me with suddenly wide eyes  --  and laughed . " A little something on the side , you mean ? " he said , and laughed again . " Hell , I do n't see how ! Everyone 's in each other 's pockets on this island . Thing like that would get around . " He paused , considering , then went on : " Truth to tell , there were days I wondered the same thing , but . . . he never left the damn island ; I know it could n't have been anyone on the island ; and , most of all . . . I know he loved Dierdre . Really loved her . Old men do n't stop talking about that kind of thing , Steve , just ' cause they 're old . I know how much he cared for Dee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; shook his head . " No , " he said emphatically , " trust me . If Evan had any mistress , it was the sea . " <p> That night I finally worked up the nerve to return to the ocean . The mosquitoes were fierce , but the beach , thankfully , was deserted ; I stood a few feet away from the shoreline , watching the surf roll in , foam spilling up onto the sand and then receding again . I felt like a fool . Already the memory of what had happened seemed more and more like a dream , an illusion . But I had to follow it through . <p> I stood there a long moment , then called out , my voice muffled by the crashing waves . <p> " Who are you ? What are you ? "  --  although I thought I might already know . <p> The waves crashed to shore , oblivious to my presence . I felt even more like an idiot . But I tried again . <p> " What do you want from me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand , then receded. . . but this time , as the tide ebbed back into the sea , it left behind markings in the sand . . . furrows made as if by fingertips . . . letters . A word . A name . <p> Evan . <p> My body shook . <p> It was a minute before I could speak again . " He's. . . he 's dead , " I said finally . " You understand ? He 's gone . " <p> The waves came crashing to shore , nothing unusual about that , but I shrank back nonetheless . When the water had retreated , it had left behind two more words . <p> Know this . <p> My throat was suddenly dry ; hoarse . The only thing I could think to ask was , " Why ? " <p> The waves came again , erased the message , and left a new one . Simple , and to the point . <p> Loved him . . . <p> My breath caught in my throat . It was true . Everything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more  --  before I could think of what the hell to say  --  the waves had rolled in again , farther than before , swirling around my feet . I felt a light , gentle touch to my foot  --  not a caress , nothing sexual about it at all  --  more like a hand , a fingertip , touched in supplication . <p> When the surf receded , two words lay in the sand , a simple entreaty : <p> Bring back ? <p> I turned and ran , not even waiting for the tide to erase the plea . <p> I 'm not much of a drinker , but as my car headed up Main Street toward the Chincoteague Inn , I knew it was either stop for a drink or keep on driving - straight back to Atlanta . So , within minutes , I found myself on a barstool in the glass-windowed restaurant , looking out at the harbor  --  surprised to find , when I glanced at the tumbler in my hands , that I 'd downed a seven-and-seven in something like three gulps . Even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said something about me that the most difficult part of all this to accept was not the existence of something unnatural , almost unbelievable , out there in the waters off Assateague  --  an elemental ? a water spirit ?  --  but Uncle Evan 's relationship with it . Well , hell , I 'd read Joseph Campbell , but no book in the world could have prepared me for the idea that my beloved uncle could have been unfaithful to his wife . It would 've been difficult to believe for anyone who 'd ever watched the two of them together : even in their sixties , they would touch each other on the back of the hand , on the cheek , with unvarnished affection and understanding . The idea that he could kiss Aunt Dierdre good-bye in the morning , squeeze her hand fondly as he left for work , then go off for a perverted rendezvous with some . . . some creature . . . something not even human . . . it made me  --  <p> It made me furious . I hated him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dee all those years , hated the cruel joke she did n't even know had been played on her , hated the image of him suspended in the water as I had been , in unnatural embrace with a preternatural lover . God damn him ! How could he do this to her ? How could he do this to me ? Everything I believed about men and women , about caring for one another , about honesty and responsibility , I learned from Evan and Dierdre . Certainly not from my own parents . And now  --  and now  --  <p> My anger seemed to sober me up almost as quickly as the bourbon worked on me . I passed on a third drink , got up , and stood by the harbor side a long minute , taking in the air . Suddenly I hated the smell of the sea ; hated the sound of the waves lapping against the dock ; hated everything about it . I did n't care if I ever saw it again , once I left here . <p> Bring back ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Aunt Dierdre 's . I let myself in  --  she was asleep , upstairs  --  and eventually I suppose I got to sleep myself , but it was the kind of jittery , superficial slumber in which you dream you 're in bed , trying desperately to get to sleep , and you wake up at dawn feeling as though you 've gotten no rest at all . The next morning at breakfast I drank three cups of coffee . I looked like hell . <p> " You look like hell , " Aunt Dierdre said . I smiled . Nothing got past Aunt Dee . <p> Well  --  almost nothing . " Just a bad night 's sleep , " I lied . " Did you want to do some shopping today ? " <p> " You go back to bed and get some rest . I 'll take care of the shopping . " <p> " I 'm fine , " I said . " Nothing a little coffee ca n't cure .

I felt awkward here with Aunt Dee , feeling somehow complicit in Evan 's dirty little secret . . . if not worse : I had had relations with the same thing he had . I was more than complicit  --  I was just as bad as he was . <p> Dierdre may not have known my thoughts , but she sensed my mood . Quietly she said , " Thinking about Ev ? " <p> Not in any way she could imagine . I nodded . <p> " Angry at him ? " she asked . I looked up , startled . <p> " For leaving ? " she said , and I thought that was as good a way as any to explain my sullen mood , and so I nodded : " Guess so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little , " she admitted . " But , Steven . . . people who love each other always will hurt each other . You try not to , but it happens . No help for it . All you can do is forgive . God knows Ev was n't a perfect husband - remember the time he and Ben went drinking in Franklin City and nearly wrecked the boat coming back ?  --  but I forgave him that , as he forgave me not being a perfect wife . If we could do that , you can forgive him for leaving . " <p> I thought about that . I thought about it a long while . We ate in silence a minute or two , and then I heard myself saying , " Aunt Dee . . . was it really important to Evan that he have his . . . his ashes . . . scattered at sea ? " <p> Dee looked uncomfortable at the subject , and I was sorry to have brought it up again , but I had to know . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I put a hand on hers . " It 's okay , " I said gently . " I 'm not recriminating you . I just needed to know . " <p> I dropped Aunt Dee at home , and without much pleasure a t the prospect , drove back to Assateague and the beach . There were more people there now than last night , so I just stood at the shoreline watching the surf break in the distance , the steady , stately roll of the waves , rising and falling as they 'd done for millennia  --  as they would for millennia to come  --  and I had an inkling , perhaps , of why Evan wanted to make this his resting place , this place of eternal life and motion , so much bigger and grander than any one human life . I even came to have an inkling , perhaps , of why he had done what else he had . <p> Loved him . <p> Yes . Yes , I did . <p> I could not quite believe what I was planning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I had no choice , really . If I felt any kind of debt to Evan - and what I 'd gotten from him over the years far outweighed whatever anger I was still feeling  --  then I owed him this much . And perhaps , this way , I might even make some small amends for those five lost years ; time I could never recover , and would always regret . That afternoon I deliberately parked my car a block down Margarets Lane , so when I slipped out of the house a little before one A.M. , the ignition start would n't wake Aunt Dierdre . I drove through the deathly still streets of Chincoteague , coming  --  it seemed like hours , though it was only a matter of minutes  --  to the small cemetery on Church Street . . . <p> I parked along a deserted stretch of the street , got out and looked around  --  not without a certain dumb foundment that I was here , that I was even considering this . The houses across the street were all dark ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightbirds . I popped the trunk . . . took out the large garden shovel I 'd hidden there earlier in the day . . . and set off , as stealthily as I could manage , through the empty cemetery . ( It was pitch dark , yet I could n't quite rid myself of the feeling that thousand-watt searchlights were following me all the way . ) Finally , after several minutes , I came to the simple granite headstone marked <p> EVAN McCONNELLHusband , Neighbor , Waterman I stood there a moment , drawing a deep breath , working up my nerve . . . then , with a sudden spasm of courage , dug the blade into the soft , newly turned ground . I lifted up a big chunk of earth ; tossed it aside . I felt as though a threshold had been crossed . No turning back , now . They had n't seeded the plot with grass just yet , there was no sod to replace ; with luck , I would finish in an hour or two , replace the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment when my blade would strike the metal lid of the coffin ; I tried not to think about having to open it , having to reach inside , and about what I would find there . I concentrated on the shovel , on plunging it into the ground , then out , flinging earth to the side ; again the blade goes down , another chunk of earth uprooted , and another , and  --  <p> " Steven ? " <p> I dropped the shovel , reflexively . I suddenly had a pretty fair inkling of what cardiac arrest felt like . <p> I turned to discover , to my horror and embarrassment , Aunt Dierdre standing about five feet from the foot of the grave  --  the grave of her husband , the grave I was desecrating ! <p> I wanted to die . My mouth was dry as sand ; I seemed to have forgotten how to form words . " I  --  I  --  " <p> But there was no anger in her face  --  no surprise , even  --  just sadness . She took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's all right . I know what you 're trying to do . I know why . " <p> I could only shake my head , helplessly . " No , " I said . " No , you do n't . " <p> But she just smiled , softly and sadly . " I know more than you think , " she said . " I know Evan loved the sea . He was n't a very religious man , never went to church with me , but . . . there was something about the ocean that moved him , deep inside , ever since he was a boy . " <p> Her gaze drifted to the east ; toward the ocean . " If you love something that much , for that long , " she said quietly , " eventually , I suppose . . . it loves you back . . . " <p> I was stunned speechless a long moment . <p> " You . . . you knew ? " I said , finally . " He told you ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " of course not . Evan would never have hurt me that way . But I could tell . When we were on the boat together . . . at the shore . . . the way the water moved when he was around it . . . I came to feel her , her presence , after a time . But I also knew that she was no threat to what Ev and I had together , so we . . . shared him , in a way . " <p> She looked down , ashamed . " I only got selfish after he died , " she said . " Wanted him for myself . " She looked up again . " I was wrong . " <p> " No , " I said , " you were n't  --  " <p> She nodded . " Yes , I was . I 'm a good Christian , Steven . And I should 've trusted in that . " She glanced toward the soft susurrus of the ocean 's voice , whispering in the distance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll trust the Lord that when my time comes , his soul will be with me . " <p> I stayed in Chincoteague another three days  --  long enough for the body to be exhumed and cremated . And on the morning of the third day , Aunt Dierdre and I got up a little before sunrise , drove to Assateague , and stood at the shore 's edge , the horizon burnished gold and red , the wind light and dry from the south . Carefully I took the lid off the urn , and poured the first ashes into Dierdre 's cupped hands ; she looked at them a moment , lowered her lips to her hands , breathed a good-bye onto them , then held out her hands and let the wind take the ashes from her , fanning them across the glassy surface of the sea . I took the next handful , and let the wind take those as well ; and within a minute , it was all over . Uncle Evan had returned to the sea . <p> I stayed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six P.M. to start the long drive back to Washington . As I drove down Main Street , something made me stop at the town dock for one last look at the Sea Breeze , rocking gently in its berth . I noticed from dockside that the deck was wet , although the waters in the harbor seemed calm . I jumped the railing and boarded the old trawler for what was very likely the last time . There was indeed water on the decks  --  and seaweed as well , strands arranged ever so carefully on the scuffed , oaken deck . <p> They read : He loved you too . <p> I went back to my car , and in moments I was crossing the Narrows Bridge , the waters of the channel black and bright below me , flowing back endlessly , eternally , to the bosom of the sea . <p> <p> By Alan Brennert <p> Nebula Award winner Alan Brennert devotes much of his writing time to television .
