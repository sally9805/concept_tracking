Her first day of kindergarten was so awful that 40 years later , Stephanie Johnson remembers every miserable detail . Raised by a stay-at-home mother , she had never spent much time with kids her age before . Arriving at school late , she endured the cold , silent stares of 30 other children as the teacher found her a seat . When her mother abruptly vanished , she felt abandoned , and her sniffling escalated into wails . " I felt like a garbage can deposited at the curb on trash day , " she recalls . <P> She was determined that her son Jeremy would fare better . So the year before he was to start kindergarten , she overcame her lifelong shyness and began to canvass her California neighborhood , introducing herself to kids and their parents and setting up play dates with Jeremy 's future classmates . In late summer , knowing that teachers often fix up their classrooms in the weeks before school starts , she dropped by the school so she and her son could meet his teacher , who invited them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded , " Johnson says . " Jeremy is a happy , social child who , I am happy to say , occasionally gets into trouble for talking in class . " <P> At some time in their life , all children experience distress  --  commonly called separation anxiety  --  when saying goodbye to parents . But as Stephanie Johnson can attest , the suffering can be kept to a minimum  --  which is important , since the way early separations are handled , psychologists believe , can influence how people manage transitions throughout their life . <P> Many parents who helped their children master separation in day care are caught by surprise when it erupts again in preschool or kindergarten  --  or even later . " Separation is not an event . It 's a process , " says Mary Ucci , director of the Child Study Center at Wellesley College in Wellesley , Mass . " It does n't happen once . It happens continually over a lifetime . " In fact , adults starting a new job are prey to the same prickles of panic that children experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far from being aberrant , clinging to parents is instinctual , adaptive behavior . " Human children are very fragile and vulnerable compared with animals that can move independently from their parents at birth . They really depend for survival on their parents or some other connected adult , " says Ucci . <P> PLAY GAMES For young children , games such as peekaboo and hide-and-seek reinforce the concept that people continue to exist even when they are no longer visible . <P> PRACTICE SEPARATING " Having successful experiences , in the sense of getting through it O.K. , even with tears , is really the only way to get used to separating , " says George Burns , principal of Fieldston Lower School in New York City . Make play dates with kids in your child 's class . Visit the classroom ahead of time to familiarize your child with new surroundings .
