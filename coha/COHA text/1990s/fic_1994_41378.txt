BANDIT EYES GLEAMED through the hole in the bedroom wall , bright with the wisdom of the wild , fixed on the one thing that moved in the room : Bones Ingraham , labouring above Harmony , sweating just a little in the evening light because there was a space where the air conditioner should be and the air that entered was heavy . The raccoon was there again . Harmony , her mind disengaged from the task at hand , watched as it crouched unafraid at the edge of the hole , its nose quivering expectantly . <p> Nothin here for you baby , Harmony thought at it . Bones worked on her oblivious to the eyes on his back , slamming into her like a beating ; pretty soon he 'd speed up his pace , working himself up to his final shudder , then he 'd sink down on her , bury his face in her hair and growl contentedly before rolling off and falling asleep . You sit still long enough , she thought at the raccoon , I might have to have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And she smiled a little at the thought and shifted to where she could take Bones ' assault more easily . <p> " Ow , " he said . " Jesus Harmony , you so thin you hurtin me . " <p> The raccoon started at the sound of his voice and skitted away into the darkening afternoon . Do n't ride me so hard then , thought Harmony , watching the striped tail disappear beyond the hole . But all she said was : " You the one with the paycheck . " <p> He bunched his strength into his buttocks and rammed deep in her , trying to make her move , moan , anything to let him know she could feel him inside . Harmony pulled her mind away and thought about the raccoon , how easy it was for it to leap out into nowhere when it was ready to go , thought about the depth of the world beyond the hole in the wall , about how easy it was to watch things leave , how hard it was to follow them . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the days when she 'd wake up in her bedroom in her mother 's apartment and look out at the stony ground of the back yard and beyond that at the ranks and ranks of sharp-smelling trees and know there was nothing in the house to eat . It was funny even then to think that a forest could exist on an island eighty-odd miles square with a population of nearly 150 thousand crowding on it . But the forest was there , a belt of trees snuggled off Gladstone Road between the ridge and Carmichael , ten miles away from Nassau : tall half-naked pines , with dark brush tops , looking like giant toilet scrubbers and smelling of green sap and rough bark . And carved in the heart of them was this neighbourhood , a settlement of misfits . Woodlands : the name always made Harmony think of a fancy burial ground , with evergreen trees planted in rows along pathways , and bright croton growing behind headstones . But the only evergreens out here were the pines ; and the graves were apartment buildings whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there fifteen years ago when her mother the hippie had driven out with her junk collection and decided to build apartments  --  there , in the middle of the pine barren . Nothing , that is , but wild orchids growing tenderly against the treetrunks and wild raccoons nosing among the grass and sand in search of year-old picnics ; nothing but the rusting bodies of cars  --  the boatlike shells of Cadillacs and giant Fords , towed out along fire trails and left to rot . Perfect for Shelly , who felt immediately at home among them , her own car half-like them and loaded down with the bits and pieces of her marriage . <p> " Here ? " Harmony , then ten , asked her mother in a faint , I-don't-believe-you voice . But in the back of her mind she knew it was just like Shelly to want to settle in a wilderness of tall trees and scrap iron . <p> " It 's perfect . Is n't it ? " Shelly replied . <p> " Mom , come down off your high and look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been smoking a spliff all the way out . <p> But when Shelly was down it made no difference ; she still thought she was home . <p> " Somebody probably already owns it , " said Harmony . <p> " I 'll buy it . Your father 's settling a lot of money on me . And besides , Mother still has my inheritance . She 's holding on to it for something just like this . " <p> Harmony doubted it . Her grandmother , Gloria , was holding Shelly 's legacy for something concrete all right , but certainly not an apartment block in the middle of nowhere . She was holding it for her daughter 's return to respectable living , for her enrolling at law school and her pursuit of a proper profession , not for this dream of inhabiting a pine barren on the island she herself had left without regrets . <p> But Shelly 'd bought the land and built the apartments anyway . <p> " You 'll love it , " she said confidently in the sunny front room of the house they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartments-to-be . " We 'll keep goats . " <p> " Goats ? " said Harmony . " What 'll Grammy say ? " <p> " Your grandmother has a rod so high up her ass I do n't know how she sits down . " <p> " Goats , " said Harmony . " Like a farm ? " <p> " Like whatever you want , baby , " said Shelly , and rolled a joint . " Dogs and cats and chickens and whatever . All I want is some peace . You could have whatever you want . " <p> This was on Harmony 's mind now . Something was usually on her mind when she and Bones had sex . Sometimes she thought about the laundry , sometimes she made shopping lists in her head . These days , though , her mind was full of food in a way her body was not . Bones had n't given her money for three weeks , and meals were hard to come by . So today Harmony was thinking about leaving . <p> I was a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while too since there 'd been real food in the house . A few oranges were all there was now , a lime , a carefully-hidden can of tunafish , and the last money she 'd had was locked in the wash-house machines in return for Bones ' laundry . <p> " You know you could always come live with us , " her father 'd said when he called from Freeport . <p> " Yeah , and you know I ca n't leave Shelly out here by herself , " Harmony replied . <p> " I do n't see why , " Paulette her stepmother interjected from the extension . " She would n't hesitate to leave you . " <p> " Shelly would never leave me , " Harmony said . <p> " Paulette , " said her father . <p> " Well . She does n't do a thing for the child . " <p> " Paulette , " said Harmony . " I 'm twenty-three . I 'm not a child . " <p> " Well , you should n't have to look after your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone , Paulette , " said Harmony 's father . " Harmony , I 'm sending your money soon . Keep an eye out . " <p> " And do for God 's sake , do n't let Shelly get her hands on it . " <p> " Paulette ! " <p> " You have your own life to lead and she has hers . " <p> " So let me lead my life , " said Harmony . <p> " Paulette , get off the phone , " said her father . <p> " I 'm only trying to help . Bye , Harmony , " said Paulette . " And do n't forget . " <p> She had n't forgotten . It was true ; these days Shelly did nothing for her but take the rent money and spend it on cocaine . And then there was Bones . He 'd come to live with her four years ago , not long after Harmony 'd left the apartment she shared with Shelly for one upstairs . She 'd liked him then : he was tall and slim and sandy-skinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bedroom hands . He was well-groomed and well-employed  --  a customs officer at the airport-and lacked only a car . He moved in partly because he was smitten with Harmony 's body ( in those days she was fatter ) and partly because Harmony 's place was a lot closer to the airport than his . Harmony also had a car . Eight months ago , though , he 'd quit . Times were hard for customs officers ; the government was cracking down on the collection of duties , and bribes were not easy to come by . Since he 'd quit , Bones was thinner than ever and the bedroom hands were forgetting their skill . And since he 'd quit Harmony 'd seen less and less of him , and less and less of her car . <p> " Wake me in half a hour , " he said into the pillow . <p> " For what ? " <p> " Got ta catch a plane . " <p> " You what ? You got ta what ? " <p> But Bones buried his head under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She climbed down out of the bed , which was a mattress laid on top of two sets of drawers , replaced the panties Bones 'd dragged off and shrugged on a sweatshirt . The kitchen was small and the corners smelled of crabfat . Windows looked over the back yard and out at the pines which remained behind their property , a precious crowdbreak between Woodlands and the spreading developments beyond . The louvres were cracked and broken in places , survivors of flailing pots ; down behind the drainboard was a butcher 's knife , hidden after a particularly harsh battle with Bones . The fridge frosted over in winter and dripped incessantly in summer and held now the oranges and the lime . The tunafish she 'd placed in the grill at the bottom of the stove . It was safe enough there for the time being . She chose an orange for supper ; it was always best to keep real food for true hunger . Half an hour later she shook Bones <p> " What you want ? " he asked . <p> " You tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? " <p> " Five . " <p> Bones threw off the cover and pushed past her into the bathroom . <p> " Where you goin ? " Harmony asked . " Where you goin ? " <p> He slammed the bathroom door behind him and turned on the water . <p> " You owe me money , Bones . Where my money ? " <p> The shower curtain scraped across the rod . She opened the door . <p> " Get the fuck outta here ! " Bones yelled from the shower . She slammed the door shut again and stood in the passage , thinking so hard her whole body trembled . If he was going away he would have a bag packed somewhere . When she discovered one , a small carry-on case shoved behind the boxes that filled the closet corner , she took it to the hole where the air conditioner used to be to see if it fit . It did . She shoved it through and heard a satisfying thud as it landed . Harmony peered through the hole . Perfect . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Better still the goats , who 'd stopped chewing the paper off Shelly 's tin cans , were eyeing the new arrivals with interest . <p> " Why you always got ta fuck with me , Harmony ? " Bones emerged naked from the bathroom . " Since when I owe you money ? " <p> " When you ga fix this hole , Bones ? It gettin cold these days . " <p> " Fuck the hole , " said Bones , pulling on a clean shirt . " Since when ? " <p> Harmony sat on the bed with her back to the hole . " Since that time , Bones . Two hundred dollars for this month rent . Forty dollars from last month . Twenty dollars for your clothes . A hundred and twenty-nine fifty-three for phone-calls you made from my phone . You want me go on ? " Behind her a sharp breeze sprang up ; rain was in the air . <p> " I owe you money ? I buy you food and put gas in your car and pay your old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Food ? What food ? You see any food in this house ? " <p> " You see a suitcase round here ? " <p> " Where you goin , Bones ? " <p> " Away . You see a suitcase ? " <p> " You pullin that shit on me again ? " she asked . " Cause lemme tell you I do n't like that shit , Bones . " <p> " Shit ? What shit ? I ask you if you see a suitcase . " <p> " I mean goin away when you owe me money . Packin your bag and hidin it so I do n't know . You pullin that shit again ? " <p> " I do n't owe you no fuckin money . " <p> " What time the plane leavin , Bones ? " <p> " Jesus Christ , Harmony , what you do with my suitcase ? " <p> " What suitcase ? What it look like ? It small , Bones ? Bout so big ? " She moved away from the hole in the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , light but cold . She slid off the bed . " You really should fix this hole , Bones . " She edged out the doorway as Bones moved towards the window . " Shoulda bought a Samsonite , Bones , " she said , and ran as fast as she could for the front door , out into the gently falling rain , down the stairs and across the yard to the neighbours ' . <p> The Majors were recent arrivals to Woodlands . They 'd appeared four years ago , newlyweds with a baby ; they 'd cleared the bush on the other side of the apartment yard and built their first home . Deanne , who came from a family of ten , had yet to grow tired of having a house of her own , and for that she loved to distract Kyle , who drove a bus for a living and did very well . Granted , he spent some of his money on girls he picked up on his routes , but since he put most of it into the house and supporting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Least Kyle do n't beat me , " she said , eyeing Harmony 's bare legs and her hair , which was mushrooming now in the damp . <p> " Bones do n't beat me , " Harmony said . <p> " Right . " <p> " Uh-uh . We fight . He do n't never get in no blow I do n't get him back for . " <p> " You think I would stay with a man who beat me up ? Hey ? Me ? When Foster try hit me I cut him with the kitchen knife , and he was Shelly man , not mine . " <p> " Okay , I believe you , " said Deanne . " So what happen to your pants ? " Harmony told her . " Gal , why you do n't put that man out ? " <p> " He owe me money , that 's why , " Harmony said . " You got any food ? " <p> " You mean he'n give you nothin again this week ? " Deanne moved to the stove and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He goin away , " said Harmony . <p> " Yeah , you hope . You hope he could get his clothes back in the bag before the plane leave , else you ga be sleepin here tonight . " <p> But Bones pulled out of the yard half an hour later , cursing Harmony . After he left she returned to the apartment and phoned his sister . <p> " Baltimore , " said Gayle , " to see his daughter . Takin her to Atlanta for the Christmas . " She paused . " I do n't know why you do n't leave . My ma had a lotta worthless sons but honest to God Bones the most worthless . " <p> " What ? You got four hundred dollars you could pay me for your brother ? " <p> " Me ? " On the other end of the line Gayle laughed . " I would n't pay his debts . Ai n't that much money in Nassau . " <p> " So do n't give me no advice , " said Harmony . " All I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I'n know . Sometime in the new year I guess . " <p> Harmony hung up . <p> Is Bathsheba McKenzie who must blame for this , she thought . If it had n't been for Bathsheba she might 've been in Freeport right now , with a job and an engineer for a boyfriend instead of a drunk ex-customs officer who stole her food and her car and gave her nothing but the hammer of his dick in return . <p> Bathsheba McKenzie was Harmony 's first real friend in the pine barren , a Cat Island woman whose farm was once not far from their apartment . She 'd come to Nassau to bear children and work for the tourists in the first of the big hotels to go up after the war , while her husband laid stone for houses till his health gave way and he died in her bed , aged forty-three . After that she 'd sought comfort in the soil , planting and growing and selling in her hours off to feed and clothe her family . Every profit she made she hoarded for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the while knowing she was likely to achieve only one or the other . When her second son had finished his studies he set himself up in a successful dry-cleaning business and gave her the land she wanted  --  six acres of it off Gladstone Road , which she cleared and planted with guinea corn and tomatoes and fruit trees . <p> When they 'd moved into the apartments a mile or so north of Bathsheba 's property the summer Harmony was eleven , the first things Shelly bought were live . A pair of goats from the big farm on the other side of Gladstone Road , a rooster and three hens , a couple of rabbits . As she said , that was all they needed . Goats and rabbits and chickens knew how to multiply themselves . Not long after they arrived two cats and a dog appeared , strays who walked out of the forest and stayed . The oats bred and the hens clucked often , depositing eggs all around the clearing while the rooster crowed triumphantly . But after a while one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbit hutch , and one morning Harmony woke to find stray tails and bloody bits of ear strewn about the yard . <p> In the end , the hens did n't last very long either . At first they thrived , scratching the ground incessantly for the feed Harmony threw them , strutting proud as their rooster of their fat sleekness . Then came a time when Shelly forgot she was a mother , forgot they had to eat , forgot everything except for the fact that she 'd discovered a new high and would do anything to get it . Those were days when the hens scratched the dust in vain , and one after the other they stopped laying eggs . Harmony took to wandering through the bush , visiting the neighbours they were beginning to have , raiding their gardens . <p> She was stealing tangerines and grapefruit when Bathsheba found her in the orchard eleven years ago . Harmony 'd discovered the property one sweltering day in the summer , when the smell of ripe mangoes led her to a low wall of <p> odd-shaped stones rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grove of trees planted in potholes in the rock , and among them a fat grey donkey gorged itself on fallen fruit . Mangoes were everywhere  --  purple Haydns and stringy native ones , on their trees and on the ground , rotting in the heat . That day Harmony carried away four : one for eating on the way home , one for giving to Shelly , one for the goats and the last to savour later . So when the food ran out and she and Shelly were eating eggs faster than the hens could lay them , Harmony took a seed sack and followed the trail to the orchard , climbed over the wall , and set about collecting fruit . <p> It was early winter , and the citrus were full and readying on the trees . Harmony worked fast , filling the bag with ripening globes and noting where later fruit grew in tight clusters . She was so busy she did n't hear the growling till it was upon her ; then she turned to face the largest potcake dog she 'd ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hackles rising on its neck and the teeth it bared at her . <p> " Whoa , " she said . The dog snapped . <p> " Sit , Ralph , " said a voice behind the dog . Ralph sat with a in , rumbling a little every now and then . Harmony looked up to meet the eyes that owned the voice and saw a straight stout person with smooth , old , bark-brown skin , a pine staff in her hand and a broad hat on her head . <p> " So you the one who been tiefin my produce , " the woman said . <p> Harmony said nothing . <p> " What happen to you ? You dumb , hey ? " <p> Harmony said nothing . <p> " En you suppose to be in school ? " asked the woman . " I got a good mind to beat you and call the police for you . " <p> Harmony said nothing , rooted to the spot , a tangerine in her hand , bearing fruit like one of the trees . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman . " I believe she simple , Ralph . I'n never see nobody get catch redhand tiefin from Bathsheba McKenzie and do n't say nothin to defend theyself . " <p> " I'n been tiefin your fruit , " Harmony said . <p> " Brazen too , " said Bathsheba McKenzie . " You see that ? She standin up in my face with her hand full of my produce and the first ting outta her mouth is she'n tiefin my fruit . You ever see , Ralph ? " <p> Ralph barked . <p> " I know , " said Bathsheba McKenzie , " people does drag they children up these days . " <p> " This is the first time I mean . " <p> " First time ? " <p> " Tiefin your fruit . " <p> " So you tiefin it now , hey ? " asked Bathsheba McKenzie . " She tiefin it now , Ralph . " She looked critically at Harmony . " First time ? " she asked again . <p> " We'n got nothin home to eat . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph , who had stopped his growling chorus , began again . <p> " Nothing cept for birdseed I mean , " said Harmony . <p> Bathsheba McKenzie stared at her for a long moment , then she threw her head back and laughed so hard her hat fell off and Ralph had to retrieve it for her . Finally she stopped and looked at Harmony again . <p> " Who ya people , child ? " she asked . Harmony told her . <p> " So that white woman is your ma ? She do n't work much , do she ? " <p> " I guess not , " said Harmony , surprising herself with the admission . <p> " When you speak to your elders you must say Sir or Mam , you hear me ? You do n't favour her much , " said Bathsheba . " She got big bones and you light . You looks like a little scrawny bird , come to think of it . Bird with plenty hair . Looka that hair , Ralph ! Drownin in it . Birdseed , hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you been eatin birdseed , " she said at last . " What happen ? You get tired of birdseed and so you come on my land and start tiefin my produce like any old bird ? " <p> " When I found this place you had so much mangoes they was rottnin on the ground . I figured you would n't miss couple . " <p> " Well , " said Bathsheba , " the child got some sense . What you name , child ? " <p> " Harmony . " <p> " Bathsheba McKenzie . I farms for a livin . When you takes my produce you takes my livin . You hear me ? " <p> " Yes , " said Harmony . <p> " Yes what ? " <p> " Yes Mam , " said Harmony . <p> " So you hungry , hey ? " <p> " Yes Mam . " <p> " Well listen . Why you do n't keep them tangerine and grapefruit you got there this time ? Next time you come ask me , you hear ? And while you askin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yes Mam . " <p> So Bathsheba became a friend . After that day she taught Harmony and Shelly how to slaughter goats , and trapped them raccoons for pies when the money ran thin . She walked over to the apartments when she received shipments of landcrabs from the island , entered their kitchen and showed them how to cook and clean them ; and when she had a bumper crop , she left bags of produce at their doorstep in the early morning . It was Bathsheba who made Harmony get up to go to school , for , as she said , a dumb bird is a useless bird . It was she who washed and starched her uniforms and combed her wandering hair ; it was she who fixed her grits and cheese for breakfast . And it was for Bathsheba that Harmony remained in the barren . <p> When Harmony was sixteen and just about to graduate from high school Bathsheba had a stroke and could n't work the land much any more . The donkey had to be sold and Bathsheba 's family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . But Bathsheba fought her way back from speechlessness to tell them about themselves and continue living off her fruit for eighteen months more , though she could no longer plant as she used to . Two years after the first stroke , Bathsheba had a second which cut off her movement entirely . Her daughter drove out one day o collect her and not long after the land was sold . From the trail in the bush Harmony watched the bulldozers ripping up the trees ; and when they returned to break the ground for the buildings she felt tears pricking the backs of her eyes . She turned her back on the land and never used that trail again . <p> " Fuck you , Bathsheba McKenzie , " Harmony said to the empty kitchen . " If it was n't for you I 'd be rich today . " Then she pulled on some jeans , took up her flashlight , and went downstairs to look for an old piece of plywood to nail across the hole in the wall . <p> She was behind the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining through the windows of Shelly 's apartment . It was a big one , the kind that cost money , and it was dark  --  the lights at the corner of the block bounced no colour through the window towards her . Footsteps sounded on the concrete walk outside Shelly 's door , and someone knocked ; but as Shelly and Collie were asleep in the bedroom the footsteps went away . Five minutes later she heard Deanne 's voice calling her . <p> The owner of the Jeep was a young man , taller than average and broadbacked , with skin a little darker than the bark of a gumalemi tree and hair that curled so smoothly she wondered at it . <p> " You Harmony Hamilton ? " he asked . <p> " Yeah . " <p> " I 'm Miles . Bathsheba McKenzie 's grandson ? " <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " My grandmother died last week . " <p> " Oh , " said Harmony . " Oh . When they burying her ? " <p> " Yesterday . " <p> " Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . <p> " Look out , " he said , " they wet . " <p> " Oh . " She stayed where she was . <p> " You okay ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " You sure ? " <p> She nodded . <p> " She left something for you , " he said . <p> " She did ? " <p> " She said you 'd take care of it . " <p> " Yeah ? " said Harmony . " What ? " <p> " I should say him , " he said . " Come . " He held out a hand , which she took , led her round the back of the Jeep and opened the door . Inside lay a half-Shepherd potcake dog , who sniffed the air and twitched his tail . <p> " Ralph ? " said Harmony . The dog whined and wagged his tail harder . <p> " She thought you 'd like to be together , " Miles said . <p> " He 's a good old dog , " said Harmony , reaching in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good old lonely dog . " <p> " I do n't think he 's very well , " said Miles . " He ai n't been eating much lately . " <p> " He grievin , " said Harmony . " Well , I ga have to find somethin for him to eat round here . Not like that ga be easy , but I could see what I could do . " <p> " If you want we could go get something now . If you want . " <p> Harmony looked at this man with his gum-tree skin and curly hair and wanted to very much indeed . <p> " Lemme just get Ralph settled , " she said . <p> As she climbed into the Jeep the rain , which had stopped falling , began again . <p> " Shit , " said Harmony , thinking about the hole . <p> " What ? " asked Miles . She looked at him , and in his eyes , which were amber like a wildcat 's , she thought she saw the same understanding that 'd been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him about the hole in the wall where the air conditioner used to be ; told him about the spaces in the windows and the front door which rattled in the wind . While she was talking he began driving , and before she 'd finished they were halfway to the food store . <p> " Now . You got wood for that hole ? " Miles asked as they lifted the dogfood into the back of the Jeep . <p> " I could find some , " she said . <p> " Let 's go buy some , " said Miles . " So what happened to the air conditioner ? " <p> " Shelly took it . Say we owe her money for the rent . She just come up there with Collie one day when I was out and yuck it out the wall . When I get back there was this raccoon sitting on my bed . " <p> " Raccoon ? " he said . " Yall get raccoons ? " <p> " Off and on . Your grammy used to cook em . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When you hungry you could eat anything . " <p> " Look here , " he said . " You hungry now ? Cause we could go get something for us to eat after we get the plywood . " <p> " You want somethin from me ! " <p> " I 'm just being kind . " <p> " Cause there 's easier ways to get it , " she said softly . " You could just ask . " <p> He did , later , after they 'd finished feeding Ralph and feeding themselves and nailing the brand-new plywood across the hole . They were standing in the front room on the way to the front door , and as the rain bringing in the cold front began slipping round the doorframe he asked his question in a sigh . <p> Sex with Miles did not inspire Harmony to make shopping lists or do the laundry in her head or think about leaving . In the end he left her ripe as one of Bathsheba 's grapefuit , full to bursting as a mango , hungry as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight years ago . <p> " I 'll call you , " he said . <p> " Do n't make promises you ca n't keep . " <p> " I do n't , " he said , and left . <p> Shelly woke her the next morning , standing by the bed with the phone in her hand . <p> " You know I ca n't sleep when people staring at me , " said Harmony . <p> " Who 's the hunk ? " Shelly settled herself on the bed , the phone on her knee . <p> " Bathsheba grandson . " <p> " Yeah right , " said Shelly . " She died . I read it in the paper . " <p> " And you'n tell me ? " <p> " I forgot . " <p> Harmony manoeuvred her head onto one arm . " So what you want ? " <p> Shelly looked at her , one pale eyebrow cocked . <p> " You do n't never come up here less you want somethin . What now ? TV ? Stove ? What ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own good .

" <p> " Oh shit , " said Harmony , sitting up . " Shelly , en I tell you and Collie to stick with Jeffrey , you could trust him ? " <p> " I know .

" You were right . You always right . " <p> Harmony studied her mother . In the fifteen years they 'd been living in the barren Shelly 'd shrunk . Once she 'd been a rangy Viking hippie , her skin brown and freckled from days in the sun , her face and arms rounded with the indulgence marijuana brought . She 'd moved slow and smiled slow and her long bright hair 'd glinted when she tossed it back . Now , though , she was tight-drawn and crumpled ; life , which she 'd searched for ever since she could think for herself , had held her in the palm of its hand , balled her up like a page not worth keeping and tossed her away . <p> " It 's Christmas , baby , " she said , " please call . " <p> Gloria Lacy was born in Nassau in the prosperous 1920s and raised during the depression that followed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , and Gloria grew up having more in common with the coloured children in the road behind than with the whites next door . She entered adulthood hating black and white Bahamians alike , married an American serviceman near the end of the war , and when peace came gladly picked up everything she owned , including Shelly , and moved with her husband across the water . She 'd had high ambitions for her only child . Shelly was sent to the best schools , pushed to gain scholarships , destined for a future as a lawyer ; and then she married Gerald Hamilton , a penniless activist , and black . Gloria knew nothing about it till her daughter showed up one Thanksgiving with a baby on her shoulder and a husband in tow ; she 'd been fuming ever since . <p> " So , " she said grimly at the sound of Harmony 's voice , " she 's dead . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Your mother . Is she dead ? " <p> " Why ? " <p> " I figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She ca n't be giving up all that foolishness about living in the bush and coming back home , because if she was I 'd be talking to her right now . And I know you 're not calling me for money because you do n't have that kind of money to waste , not on a long-distance phonecall that 's going to et you nowhere . So I figure she must be dead . " <p> Harmony sighed . " Merry Christmas , Grandmother . " <p> " And you . Are you still seeing that apeface man ? " <p> " Bones ? " <p> " Because if you are I have nothing to say to you either . " <p> " He moved away , " Harmony said , fixing her eye on a pair of Bones ' shoes and wondering whether the goats could cope with patent leather . <p> " Well . It 's possible you at least have a modicum of good sense . Honestly . How I raised a child as self-destructive as your mother I do not know . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gem . He is a jewel . He is a saint sent from heaven . We 're having his family here for Christmas dinner . You know that his Jonathan is a partner in the law firm now . Felicity has just got a job offer from some high-powered publishers in New York . And Martin has decided to take an early retirement , he has that much money put away . " <p> " Give them all my love , " said Harmony . She rolled her eyes at Shelly , who was drawing dollar signs on an old envelope . <p> " Is that it ! " asked Gloria . " Because you sure as hell ca n't pay for any long overseas conversation for nothing . If you have something to tell me , out with it . Be a woman . " <p> " I was wondering . " <p> " Yes ? " <p> " Since it 's Christmas and all , the holiday season , you know  --  " <p> " Goodbye , Harmony . " <p> " We have n't even had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't be ridiculous , " said Gloria , " it has n't been that long . " <p> " Shelly thinks you hate her . You do n't think it 'd be a nice gesture maybe to send her something for Christmas she could really use ? Let her know you still love her even if you do n't approve of her ? " <p> " Michelle knows just exactly what I feel for her , " said Gloria , " she does n't need money to prove it . " <p> " Oh , you was thinking of money ? " asked Harmony . Shelly gave a little hiccup that might 've been a giggle . " Good idea . Shelly could really use some money . " The silence on the end of the line was thick as summer . " Grammy " <p> " It 's a pity , " said Gloria , " that your talent for dissembling should be so wasted . " <p> " Pardon ? " <p> " You disappoint me , Harmony . It 's bad enough having a child who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good thing Grampa is dead , right ? " Harmony finished for her . <p> The silence gathered again . " Let me talk to your mother , " said Gloria finally . Harmony handed Shelly the phone and left to check on Ralph . <p> They 'd taken him to the half-ruined hut where the rabbits used to have their hutch , a makeshift affair of plywood and concrete blocks built in the lee of an old car . The ground inside was strewn with decaying leaves and pine needles and was warm enough and dry enough to serve its purpose ; in it Harmony 'd placed an old towel that Bathsheba 'd given her years ago , hoping that Ralph would be able to trace some faint scent of his mistress and settle easily . It seemed to have worked . When Harmony arrived , he was sleeping soundly , and raised an ear only when she called his name . <p> " Food , boy ? " she asked . The ear lifted higher . " Food ? " Ralph opened an eye and twitched his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She crouched beside him and took his head between her hands and rubbed it . " You lonely , boy ? You lonely ? " She held her cheek down to his nose and he snuffled it lightly . " Well , " she said after what felt like a long time , " only thing I know for loneliness is food " And she stood up , took his bowl , and returned to the apartment to fill it . <p> When she came downstairs again a black Jeep was in he yard and Miles was standing : by the doghouse . <p> " Sleep well ? " he asked . " I almost did n't make it home . Next time I think I ga spend the night here . Safer that way . " He caught her as she stood up from giving Ralph his food and kissed her deep enough to cause the hair at the back of her neck to stir . <p> " I thought you was ga call , " she said . <p> " Your phone was busy and I could n't wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always doin . Nothin . " <p> " Good , " he said . " Let 's go driving . I feel like sitting by the sea somewhere and talking . And I could always buy you lunch . " <p> As they were leaving Shelly opened the door of her apartment and waved frantically at them . Her hair was drawn into a ragged tail at the back of her neck ; somewhere she 'd found lipstick , which she 'd applied with a shadow of her former skill . <p> " Where you going ? " she asked as Miles stopped . <p> " Out , " said Harmony . <p> " I do n't need to tell you what your grandmother said . " Shelly leaned her head in the window . " Hi hunk . Harmony , you think you could help me here ? " <p> " No , " said Harmony . <p> " Do n't you get something from your father soon ? " <p> " Let 's go , Miles . " <p> " Wait ! I ' .. pay you back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave , Harmony , on my legacy , on everything I hold sacred- " <p> " Miles , " said Harmony , " drive . " <p> " Baby  --  " <p> " Put your foot on the fuckin gas , Miles , " said Harmony , and rolled up the window . Shelly , shaken from the Jeep , stood in the road watching it depart . " I hope you know what you doing , hunk ! " she hollered . " My daughter 's the fastest fuck this side of 42nd Street , she 'll suck you dry and drop you before you even get soft again ! " <p> " Jesus , " said Harmony , closing her eyes . <p> " You okay ? " Miles asked . <p> " I'n want talk bout it , " she said , " just drive . " <p> They spent the day burning gas and covering roads in the sparsely populated west end of the island . Miles told her about Jamaica , where he was at university , about law , which he was studying , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a rutted track where a grey wooden jetty poked into the sea and a pair of women and a man cleaned fish in the shallows beneath it . A beach stretched south from the track , and Miles led Harmony along it . <p> " You ga fuck me out here , hey ? " she asked with half a laugh . The sand was fine and smooth , and the beach curved away from the jetty , nothing behind it but bush and nothing before but the bay . Miles , who 'd taken her hand loosely in his , turned and looked at her . <p> " Do n't , " he said . <p> " Do n't what ? " <p> " Talk about it like that . " <p> " What ? Fuck ? You do n't want me say fuck , Miles ? " <p> " It makes it sound dirty , " he said and dropped her hand . <p> " What you want me say ? " Miles was silent , staring past her , back the way they 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harmony turned around . Behind her the fishing group was getting ready to go . The man , a small figure at the end of the dock , wound his lines methodically around their spools , around and around like some game which had no beginning and no end but had to be played anyway . One of the women loaded the fish into the bus they 'd parked a foot away from the jetty , and the other filled plastic bags with fish guts for tomorrow 's bait . The air around all of them was clear , the breeze taking hold of their skin in gentle nips and chasing the clouds from the sky . " You got a girlfriend , Miles ? " <p> " What ? " he said at last . <p> " Do n't tell me you'n got no woman . Cute as you is , you got ta have a girlfriend . " He was silent again . " Well ? " <p> " Do n't you have a man ? " <p> " If you call Bones a man , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . What we do with them , that 's makin love . What you and me do together is fuck . " <p> " No . " <p> " You do n't like it , do n't do it . You could just take me home . " <p> He looked at her then . " I got a girlfriend , " he said . " In Trinidad . " <p> " That 's where she from ? " He nodded . " She doin law too ? " <p> " Yeah . She 's coming here New Year 's . " <p> Harmony stared at the ocean spreading indigo and unsettled beyond the reef and thought about Bathsheba in the ground and the raccoon waiting inside the hole , scratching at the plywood because it could n't get in . " So this a two-week affair . " <p> " It 's as long as you want it to be . " Miles reached out a hand and ran a finger from her shoulder down to her elbow . Goose pimples raised on her spine ; she shuddered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't ? " he said , pulling her closer . <p> " Who knows ? " Harmony turned . " I hungry . Let 's go get some food . Then we could go home and fuck our brains out . " <p> " How come you so difficult ? " Miles asked into her hair . His arms tightened around her waist , under her breasts ; if he squeezed any harder he would be counting her ribs , and his cock would be tracing the bones in her spine . She pulled away . <p> " If you do n't want buy me lunch you could take me home . " <p> " Forget it , " he said , and took her hand back . " I 'm sorry . Let 's go eat . " <p> " You should listen to my mother , " said Harmony . " She usually right . " <p> When they returned to the apartment it was gathering dark . No light was burning in Shelly 's place , which meant she was either asleep or high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved his tail among the leaves and looked at them , and then they climbed the stairs together , one stair apart until they reached the top . The bed was unmade , just as they 'd left it , and Miles lifted her and laid her down on it , soft as the clouds the air 'd breathed away . He undressed her and as he did he kissed her , little nips of kisses that chilled and heated her all at once . When he was naked above her he leaned over and whispered like the wind : " I do n't fuck people , Harmony . I make love . " And , as he slowly began to take her : " I sure you could do with a little loving . " <p> Harmony did n't know when she stopped breathing air . All she knew was she found herself gasping great sobs , like a fish who could n't get enough oxygen and was heaving and blowing for life itself . <p> She woke to the bright day and the full smell of food on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her and trailed it to the kitchen , where Miles stood at the stove , cooking bacon and eggs and grits . <p> " You up , then , " he said , and poured a glass of orange juice out for her . <p> " Where you get all this ? " <p> " I bought it . " He pointed at a chair . " Sit . I want ask you something . " <p> " What ? " Harmony leaned against the counter and watched him . He certainly knew how to handle a frying pan . " Who teach you how to cook ? " <p> " My grandmother , " he said . " How come you do n't work ? " <p> " What a question , " she said . <p> " No , really . I want know . You seem pretty bright . How come you just hang round here ? " <p> " What you want from me ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> " You sure ? " <p> " Sure . Sit , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like yours ? " <p> " Sunny side up . I ca n't work . " <p> " How come ? " <p> " I'n Bahamian . " <p> He turned to look at her then , puzzled . <p> " Your mother 's Bahamian , right ? " he said . " I thought Grammy told me she was Bahamian . " <p> " My mother , " Harmony said cheerfully , " made a mistake . She marry a foreign man and had a foreign child in a foreign country . She Bahamian , but I ai n't . " <p> " I do n't et it . " Miles rescued toast from the toaster , which was inclined to burn things , and began spreading butter . <p> " Is the law , " Harmony said . " Is the fuckin law . I could apply for my citizenship but they do n't have to give me it . They ga probably offer me permanent residence and where I ga find five thousand dollars to pay for it ? I'n Bahamian because my father ai n't and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to marry him before she even got pregnant with me . " <p> " So you applied ? " <p> " What this is ? " <p> " I bet if you apply they would n't turn you down . You been here all your life . " <p> " Miles , " said Harmony , tiring of the conversation , " what you want from me ? " <p> " Nothing , " he said , turning the eggs out onto the plates . " Or at least , for you to let us make love . " <p> " Love do n't just happen like that , Miles . " But she sat where he told her and let him serve her food . <p> " It do n't ? <p> " Uh-uh . When you stick a cock in a cunt , love do n't just come . " <p> " Well something sure did last night , " said Miles . " How you like your coffee ? " <p> " We have milk ? " <p> " Yes indeed . " He opened the fridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Why you doing this , Miles ? You just met me . What you doing all this for ? " <p> " I like you , Harmony Hamilton . I just met you but I like you already . " He sat and took a bite of his food . " And more than that , my grammy liked you . She liked you enough she gave you her dog . " <p> " yeah . " <p> " I guess you could call that love , giving you her dog . " <p> " I guess . " <p> " It 's good enough for me . Besides , " he added , " she fed you when she was out here . You should let me do the same . " <p> For the time being , Harmony was content to let him do just that . <p> He left sometime in the afternoon , taking his leave gently , with a kiss that lingered on Harmony 's mouth long after the dust from the Jeep 's departure settled in the yard . It was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get his bowl , the dog was nowhere to be seen . The bowl from the night before was empty , licked clean , but Ralph was not nearby , and did n't come when she called . <p> " He mussee feelin better , " she told the goats . " He ga come when he smell his food . " And the goats , ever-solemn , nodded and watched the bowl with fascinated eyes as she put it down . <p> She took the tunafish out of the stove after she returned upstairs . The can was rusting around the edges ; she decided to give it to the cats . Her luck was turning . First Bones ' leaving , then Miles , then the gift of Ralph from Bathsheba , even though she was dead . Her father was sending money . She had food in the house . The last thing she needed was a spoiling tin of tuna . <p> And indeed her luck had turned . Every day after that for a week she saw Miles . He never spent the night again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun , began to enjoy the shape of his head and neck and shoulders above her , beside her , in the watery light of the short afternoons . When she closed her eyes in the evenings after he 'd gone , and before she opened them to the morning sunshine , she saw their shape in the bed between her and the door , a wall between her and the world beyond him , the world of Bones , Shelly 's fury , the void where Bathsheba used to be . Sometimes after sex they slept , curled together like twin leaves budding from the same stem . Sometimes they drove , covering miles and miles of the island , travelling from end to end and looking at the sea . In the west , where the Atlantic pushed its tongue between the lips of the archipelago , it was dark and never entirely still . But in the east the water was paler and happier , and the waves played above the bank which stretched from New Providence down to the Exumas . <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? " <p> " The water . A great big jewel nobody ever named , laying on the breast of the world and just being . " His mother was from Exuma ; he 'd spent summers there . <p> " You never spent the summer with Bathsheba , " said Harmony . <p> " No . " He looked to see if there was reproach in her face , found none , returned his gaze to the moving water . " Nobody could figure out why she did n't go back to the island if she wanted to farm . They thought if she was in Nassau she should enjoy the city , and if she wanted to farm , she should go back to the island . " <p> " She stayed cause she loved you all , " Harmony said . " She 'd want be close to you . " <p> " I 'm glad she stayed , " he said at length . " If she did n't , I'd'a never met you . " He looked at her again ; she was smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miles 'd gone , Harmony stopped at the doghouse to pick up Ralph 's bowl . Since the first few days she had n't seen him ; but he came home every night , cleaned up his food , and sneaked off again before she awoke . Exploring , she decided . After all , the barren was his home . So she kept filling the bowl and putting it out last thing before she went to bed . She did n't know how long she'd 've gone on like that . Maybe forever if she had n't woke early the day before Christmas Eve , and , brightened by the freshing morning sun , dressed herself to go talk to the goats . Ralph was in his hut as she passed ; she could hear him at his food . <p> " Mornin , boy . " At the sound of her voice he stopped eating . " Is only me , " she said as she rounded the side of the doghouse . But when she bent down and looked inside it was n't Ralph who returned her stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat since she saw it last ; sleek , living well off the dogfood she 'd bought for Ralph . It stared at her , its masked eyes unflinching , its whiskers laden with food . In those eyes was the wisdom she 'd seen there before : it was the wisdom of Bathsheba , of the pine barren , of survival no matter what ; it came from waiting , from knowing that time was indeed longer than rope , that what went around came around in the end . Last week the raccoon was hungry . Now it was full . <p> As she watched , the raccoon turned its back to her deliberately , knowing she was harmless , and began cleaning out the dog bowl . She watched it over its head . It used its forepaws as hands to feed itself , the way a monkey would , or a person . When it was finished it ducked its head between its shoulders and licked the remains . With its hands it drank water from the pail , and then sat back and cleaned itself like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing caution , it dashed out of the hut , scarcely disturbing the pine needles and the dry leaves and the old towel of Bathsheba 's which still lay between the back wall and the door . <p> " Ralph died , " she told Miles when he came to pick her up for lunch . <p> " Where ? " <p> " I'n know . " She told him about the raccoon . <p> " Maybe Ralph just found a woman , " Miles said . <p> " He dead , " said Harmony . " He just walk off into the trees and find himself a dyin place . Dogs do that . " <p> " You miss him ? " <p> " I miss Bathsheba , " Harmony said , and had to hold herself straight and hard to keep back the water she felt gathering behind her eyes . " I'n even know where yall put her down . " <p> They drove in silence thick and unbroken as April smoke over the barren . They bought their lunch as usual and Miles drove aimlessly along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled off the road and parked facing the sea . They ate in silence and kept the windows open , hoping the winter breeze that chopped up the sea into purple and blue and silver lights would do the same to the haze between them . But it did n't . Harmony watched the bright water and the clouds the colour of smoke and knew what the raccoon knew without thinking : all things had an end except time . All things passed away  --  Bathsheba , Ralph , this pain that prodded her chest whenever she thought about Miles  --  but time remained , wise as the raccoon , going on and on and on . <p> " I have to talk to you , " Miles said , and was silent . <p> " If is about your girlfriend , " said Harmony at last , " I know . " <p> " She coming Boxing Day . " <p> " Do n't worry , " said Harmony . " Bones comin back soon . We'd'a had to stop anyhow . " <p> He smiled a little and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , looking up at the ocean and then across at her , " I do n't want it to stop . " His eyes were light and very clear , as if newly washed , and as he moved to kiss her she thought water gleamed on his lashes . The idea shook her worse than any desire he could call out of her . <p> " Let 's go , " she said , and fixed her eyes straight ahead . " Take me home and let 's fuck our brains out . " But her mind was on the barren and Shelly and Bones . <p> They made love in the sunlight bathing her bed , and Harmony , knowing now what the raccoon knew , cleaved to Miles as if it were the last time . She took him in her and held him , controlled him , pulled away when he began his thrusting- and rolled him over and rode him , calling out of herself the rage and the energy the pine barren had put in her , forcing pleasure to well up and break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyelids and rolled down her cheeks . After the fury she rolled off Miles and lay on her back staring at the ceiling and let him wet his fingers in the lovewater flowing on her face ; but she kept herself rigid , thinking of corpses and trying to make her pulse stand still . When he opened his lips to whisper what she thought she 'd heard in his voice by the sea she closed her eyes and willed it to pass . But she did n't draw away when he circled her with his arm , and she lay awake long after he 'd drifted into sleep , and traced the darkening planes of his head again and again with her eyes . As the sun sank the light outside the window grew cold , but the tops of the pine trees stayed light and golden ; and when they were aflame with the sunset , Miles woke . <p> " What 's the time ? " he asked . <p> " After four . " <p> " Come on , " he said , dressing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where we goin ? " <p> " Hurry up . " Before she could move he 'd tossed her a sweatshirt and jeans and was leaving the room . <p> " Where we goin ! " she asked as he backed out of the yard , raising dust and rousing the dogs . <p> Miles took a tape off the dashboard and pushed it in the deck . <p> " Well do n't mind me if I catch a nap , " she said . She stretched her neck , leaned her head back , closed her eyes , and listened to Miles singing along with the music . Far away , beyond the closed windows of the Jeep , she heard the horns and engines of cars , the rush of tyres on the highway and the breeze high in the trees . And then there was no noise at all . She opened he eyes ; it was dark , and the Jeep was passing between pillars . The name on them was WOODLAWN . <p> They 'd put her to rest in a shady burial ground far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew in rows and croton brightened the headstones . She was lying in the shadow of a yew tree , and they 'd given her everything good money could pay for , even her own fresh marble stone to mark the grave : <p> BATHSHEBA MCKENZIE <p> BELOVED MOTHER &; GRANDMOTHER <p> BORN CAT ISLAND NOV 11 1919 <p> DEPARTED THIS LIFE DEC 10 1992 <p> AGED 73 YEARS <p> MAY SHE REST IN PEACE <p> Harmony touched the headstone . It was cold and smooth . She thought of the woman who was warm and rough , who loved limestone rock and dark brown earth and the thorns of the lime and the strings of the mango , who chopped wood and broke stone with her own back , who wrung the necks of chickens and slit goats ' throats without flinching . Who made her own grits sometimes and braided Harmony 's hair sometimes and sat in the sun in back of her house and told stories to the donkey and the dog and the little girl , all about her husband and her children and the island she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers and loved . Harmony touched the headstone , which had to cost as much as just one of the sold farm lots , and felt salt water slide down her face . <p> Miles moved to hold her ; she stepped away . <p> " Take me home , " she said , angry at the tears . <p> " Wait , " he said , reaching in his jacket pocket , " I got your Christmas present . " He took her hand , turned it palm upward , and placed in it a small box . <p> " I do n't want it , " she said , " take me home . " <p> " Why ? ' <p> " How yall could do this to her ! " she whispered . " You'n even put her in the ground beside her husband . " <p> " But this is a nice place . " He pushed the box into her hand again . " Open it . " <p> Inside lay a gold bracelet , its links flat , close-fitting , perfect . <p> " Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want it , " she repeated . " Please . Take me home . " He turned around and walked quickly towards the Jeep , so quickly in the darkness she had to hurry to keep sight of him . The engine was running when she reached the Jeep and before she could shut the door he was reversing . But at the road he stopped and leaned on the wheel . <p> " I bought it for you , " he said , " I want you to have it . " <p> " Give it to your woman , " she said . <p> " I am . " <p> She looked at him full then , straight into his wildcat eyes , and thought she saw in them what the headstone had told her : what mattered was money and status and schooling and nothing else . Nothing . <p> " On second thoughts , " she said , " I'n want carry you out your way . Drop me downtown . " <p> " Downtown ? " <p> " I ga catch Kyle bus home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " just do what I want do for once . Okay ? Take me downtown and leave me . I'n want see you , I'n want hear from you , I'n want talk to you again , you hear ? Drop me downtown and go pick up your nice Trinidad woman and go eat your Christmas dinner with your nice rich family and leave me the fuck alone . " <p> " Great Saviour , " he said , but did as he was told . <p> When they arrived downtown Harmony laid the box on the dashboard and was opening the door when Miles placed a hand on her arm and held it hard . <p> " I got you a job , " he said . <p> " You what ? " <p> " I got you a job . New Year 's Day . My cousin 's shooting three commercials . I showed him a picture of you and he liked it . " <p> " And you'n ask me ? " <p> " A thousand for the three , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd mind . " He pulled a card from his pocket and passed it to her . " See the address . " <p> " Where you get a picture of me from ? " <p> " Your bureau drawer . " Miles grinned . " You did n't notice ? " <p> " How you know I could model ? " <p> " For God 's sake , Harmony , I see your body every day . " <p> She looked across at the bus stop ; Kyle was n't there yet . She studied the card . " A thousand for three ? " she said . " Jesus . I got ta be good for that kinda money . " <p> " You could do it , " he said , and kept hold of her arm . " I know you could do it . Anyhow , you got ta do it  --  I promised him you 'd be there . Round two . " <p> " Jesus , " she said again . <p> " If you do n't come I 'll come looking for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year 's Day . " <p> " A thousand for three , " she said . " Okay . " <p> " Good , " he said . He pulled her across the front seat and held her . " You still mad ? " She smiled , sadly , into the front of his jacket , which was nylon and slippery . " Hey ? " He lifted her chin , movie-wise , to look down at her face ; then he kissed her . Despite herself the cold warmth spread inside her , her stomach , her chest , her neck , the top of her head , her legs and arms , till all of her was awake ; then she was opening the door and standing on the sidewalk . <p> " You'n even know what she want , Miles , " she said , " how you could love me ? " He pointed to the box . She reached in the window and took it . <p> " I 'll see you , " said Miles , and was gone . <p> Kyle was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He grinned at Harmony and pulled down the seat closest to the driver . " What happen , you spend ya money already ? " he asked . <p> " Money ? " <p> " Ya Christmas money . I been up home for lunch . Some gal was lookin for you , say she bring some money for you from ya pa . Yvette , Chernette , somethin like that . " <p> " Renette ? " <p> " Could be . " Kyle blew his horn , pulled out into the traffic , and overtook a line of cars . " Small and cute . Dead fine . " <p> " Shit , " said Harmony . Paulette 's sister . The only reason her father would send anything with Paulette 's family was because it was cash . " Who she give it to ? " <p> " I'n know . " <p> " I hope she'n give . it to Shelly . " The thought kept her rigid the whole ride home , the box from Miles grooved in her hand and forgotten . How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred , three hundred dollars ; it was Christmas . As the bus pulled into the yard she was out the door and running , no , flying upstairs to see what was there . The front door was locked but on the coffee table was an envelope shaped like a Christmas card , open . The card was in it and nothing else . <p> " Shelly ! " <p> But downstairs the front door was barred and the curtains at the back were drawn tight over the sliding door . Harmony felt a numbness possess her greater than that called up by Bones ; and though her body could no longer feel it could move . Her legs bent on their own , her knees hit the ground , her head fell back , her mouth opened and the wail that unrolled itself wailed for everything she 'd lost . When it stopped the whole barren was silent . <p> She climbed the stairs one by one , conscious of placing each foot before the other . She entered her kitchen , lifted the loose chunk of wood behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out behind the goat-pen was the big rock Bathsheba 'd set up for a whetstone . On this Harmony sharpened the blade , sharpened it till its edge gleamed with promise . Then she returned it to the drainboard and put herself to bed , and slept the dead sleep of the beaten . <p> On New Year 's Day Harmony rose early . When she was dressed she took Miles ' bracelet from its box and hung it on her wrist . She counted the change she 'd gleaned from nooks of the apartment the night before , a meagre thirty cents , and walked out into the sunshine . The cool weather had passed . The day was warm , not the stifling warmth that came with summer , but hot enough to discourage walkers . Harmony . had no car . All she had was two-fifths of a single bus-fare , and it would take two buses to get her to the studio . So she stood before Shelly 's door , holding her anger in one hand and knocking politely with the other . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it 's you . " <p> " Happy New Year , " Harmony began . <p> " You must want something , " said her mother . <p> " I need some money . " <p> " You do ? " Behind the window Shelly straightened . <p> " Gee . " <p> " For the bus . " <p> " For the bus . " <p> " You could lend me seventy cents ? " <p> " Same way you lent me money ? " <p> " For the bus , Shelly . Loose change . " <p> " What did you say now ? I said , Harmony , you could help me out here ? No , Shelly . Honey please , I said , I need it ? No , Shelly . I owe the man , Harmony . No , Shelly . Drive , hunk . Put your foot on the gas and drive . " <p> " Seventy cents . " <p> " No , Shelly , " said her mother . <p> Harmony 's fist tightened on her anger . " Loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of the window . <p> " You took my money , Shelly , " she prodded , holding her voice quiet against her temper 's edge . <p> " Your money ? You owe me rent . " <p> " Bones owe you . I done pay my share . " <p> " Same diff . " <p> " Still . You took my money . " <p> The silence returned , sudden as the clack of a Venetian blind . <p> " Loose change ? " <p> " Loose change . " <p> " That 's all ? " <p> " That 's all . " <p> " Wait . " Shelly walked away into the gloom of the apartment and returned jingling change in one hand . Harmony stood back a little as the louvres nearest the door opened and Shelly stuck a fist through the hole in the corner of the screen . Coins clinked against the concrete sill : two American nickels and a single ten-cent piece . <p> " What this is , Shelly ? " Harmony kept her voice soft , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> " Loose change . " <p> " Twenty cents ! " <p> " The bus costs fifty cents , right ? Two fifties , a dollar . Seventy from a dollar , thirty . Thirty from fifty , twenty . " <p> " But I ask you for seventy , " said Harmony , and the words slipped flattened through her lips , like letters missing from mailboxes or already-opened Christmas cards . <p> " That 's two buses , " said Shelly , and the louvres began to close . " I lending you money for one . I do n't care how you get back . " The window shut with a thud , and shuddered as Shelly screwed it tight . <p> Maybe if I phone , Harmony thought , I could let Miles know I ga need a ride . But her telephone , when she lifted it in her apartment upstairs , was silent . <p> This time when she passed Shelly 's door she did n't hold back her anger , she let it run loose , and it slammed her against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth in impotent rage . <p> " You'n even pay the fuckin phone bill ! " <p> But though the doorframe shook there was no reply . Harmony turned away and began the dusty walk to the main road . <p> Gladstone Road was long , straight and flat , one of the longest straight roads on the island , where streets followed the coast , climbed ridges , listed off the rims of baby hills . From the northern rise where it began to Carmichael Road in the south , it was maybe six miles long , and from Woodlands you could see it all . The pines grew tall but at this time of the day they cast little shade ; where they 'd been replaced by development , by open lots and low stone houses , shadows were squat and warm . Harmony set her back to the sun and stared north up Gladstone Road , looking for the bus Kyle said would pass round noon . But the road was empty and the sun was hot . <p> Across the road weeds moved , waving their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mask across its eyes and rings around its tail . Harmony stared but the raccoon remained hidden . She looked around again . A little behind her , not far from the pillar which 'd once borne a name , WOODLANDS , was a phone box . It was set back from the road , two sides of it brushed by bushes and grasses , but it was well-kept , a necessity here where houses sprouted faster than cables were run . She could telephone the studio from there , but it would mean risking twenty-five cents of her bus money ; if she lost even one coin she 'd miss her bus . She looked north at the ridge and , seeing nothing , entered the box and dialled the number on the business card . No answer . Across the road the grass parted and the raccoon pushed its way onto the pebbles at the roadside . Harmony pressed the receiver down and tried again , dialling the second number on the card . This time the phone clicked in answer . She was just wetting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape . Across the road the raccoon gathered itself , its head alert , its eyes trained on her . There was the beep . <p> " Hey , " she said , " this Harmony . I stuck , no money , no ride . If you do n't see me  --  " The raccoon jumped into the air , beg-inning its crossing in bounds . Then it was no longer leaping but flying . It turned over and over , black against the bright sunshine , a dark furry ball . Behind it rushed a pale thing with letters on its side , trailing a wake of smoke . <p> By the time she reached the raccoon the bus was simply a white insect on a dull grey ribbon . The raccoon 's tail was magnificent in the sun ; its coat was glossy and unmarked . There was no blood . The body twitched a little , but stilled as she watched and , when she touched it , was warm , nothing more . She lifted it . It was heavy , fat with Ralph 's food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first what she thought of were tears , a roadful of them , and she saw herself kneeling on the faded tar with the raccoon in her arms , spilling salt water for all the things she 'd never have . But the raccoon was heavy . Its meat was real , enough for a week maybe , and in the end her stomach spoke bigger than her mind . In the end she cradled the raccoon like a gift , never minding that its fur poked between the links of her bracelet so that later , when she went to take the bracelet off , a few stray strands of coon hair would stop her hand . She carried the raccoon back to the apartment , laid it on the doghouse roof , fetched her knife from the drainboard upstairs , and skinned and gutted and cleaned and chopped till all she could smell was fresh meat and fat and her head span with the rightness of it all . <p> She did n't have what was needed for a pastry so she washed out the big pot she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stew . She cooked outside on the blackstone fireplace she and Bathsheba 'd built together one long-ago morning when the gas gave out . The smell of that meat was the best smell she remembered  --  better than Bathsheba on a Sunday , better than night-blooming jasmine , better than a windy sea . When it was ready it was too much for her to eat alone . She stared at it for a long time , thinking back to days when she and Shelly still lived together , when Bathsheba 'd come and fix them dinner on the open fire and they 'd sit and laugh softly long into the night . Shelly knew cocaine even then , but she was still plump enough to look lovely with fireglow colouring her arms . If she was high she 'd talk loudly , overwhelming them with her confidence . But sometimes she was n't high and she 'd just sit , staring at the fire . Harmony hated those quiet times ; Shelly 'd taken herself somewhere not even her daughter could follow her . <p> She dished up stew into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shelly 's door . " You want eat with me ? " she asked . Shelly , remembering hunger , stepped outside . They sat at the crumbling picnic table and ate together , and the fire glowed red and made Shelly almost lovely in its light . " Shelly , " Harmony said after she finished at last , her belly full , her anger long gone , " is the raccoon we eatin , not you . " " Honey  --  " said Shelly , and stopped . But in her eyes , which were pale in daylight and shadowed now , there grew a sadness whose roots were in her heart . <p> " It do n't matter , " said Harmony . " I 'll get more money soon . " And she knew suddenly what the raccoon knew , and Bathsheba : the pine barren was not barren at all but lavish with life , and you 'd see it if you looked deep enough into the now . <p> There was plenty stew left when they 'd eaten their fill . Harmony carried the pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then she returned outside where the night lay back moonwashed and mild , and looked at the teeming wilderness . As she stood on her balcony a black Jeep drove slowly toward the apartment . Halfway there it stopped , waited , and finally turned around . She saw it go , but was n't afraid ; in time it 'd be back . <p> Bones returned the next evening , full of Heineken and swaying on his feet . She was ready for him , and took the blows and the abuse he dealt her without flinching . She was ready even for the end of the argument , when Bones pulled her onto the bed and began his thick kissing ; and she let him fuck her , her eyes on the ceiling , her mind remembering Miles . Later , while Bones was sleeping , she crept into the kitchen and took from behind the drainboard the knife she 'd used to skin the raccoon . She picked it up and felt the weight of it , strong as she was now , sharp enough to split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of all the good that 'd come to her in the last two weeks  --  Miles ' touch , an old pale dog , fresh strong meat . And she thought of all the good that was going to come . <p> She returned to the bedroom silent as a shadow , knife in hand . If Bones was awake all he 'd see was a brief darkening of the mirror , and he 'd wonder maybe why the glass flashed suddenly , as if moonlight had touched it and drawn back again . But he was n't awake . He 'd sleep all night and know nothing when he woke . <p> Harmony lifted the tail of his shirt and yucked hard to pull his shorts down around his thighs . His withered dick flopped like a failed sausage between his legs , darker than the rest of him and old before its time . She took the knife in her hand and balanced it . It was hard and cold and right . She balanced it and thought of riding Miles and how good the raccoon smelled cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bones ' stomach , starting at the navel and heading towards his crotch , mowing a path through the hair , nicking the skin at the base of his cock . She stopped it there , lazily , remembering how easy the coonskin 'd peeled at the touch of this knife , wondering how easy his cockskin would peel . Then she climbed up into the bed and kneeled on Bones ' chest and laid the sharp edge of the knife against his throat , right between his voicebox and his jawbone , and waited for day to dawn clean . <p>
