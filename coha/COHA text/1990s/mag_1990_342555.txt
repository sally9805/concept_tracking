Order a frank with everything at Law Dogs , a Van Nuys , Calif. , hot dog stand , and you 'll get onions , chili , cheese  --  and a dollop of professional legal advice . The last comes courtesy of proprietor and practicing attorney Kim Pearman . In 1980 Pearman grew restless with the dog-eat-dog world of litigation and erected the world 's first combination law office and wienerama , which offers legal help to go every Wednesday night . And while his culinary canines range in price from a $1.15 plain Plaintiff Dog to a fully dressed $1.45 Judge Dog , Pearman 's jurisprudence plat du jour is free of charge . <P> From a rocking chair behind the kitchen , Pearman dispenses advice on divorce , landlord-tenant disputes and other food for tort . Locals have developed a taste for Pearman 's guidance . Referrals from agencies and simple word of mouth have brought 10,000 client customers to his door , hungry for justice .                    @
