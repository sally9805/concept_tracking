<p> Sean took a long , cool pull of his beer and arched an eyebrow . Between the Irish bagpipes blasting a reel on the speakers overhead and the din of chatting folk along the bar , he had no fear of being overheard . <p> " Sure , if you 're on the run we help you out . What would you expect ? " said Sean , an illegal Irish immigrant who carefully guards his true identity . " We know who the ' fugitives ' are , and you just do what you can for them , which is n't much . A little money , place to stay , you know . " <p> " But do we ship money back to the IRA , or even have anything organized here , like some spy ring ? " he added with a grin . " C'm on . We 're Irish . We talk too much to pull something like that off . " <p> Standing in the Abbey , a San Francisco bar so authentically Irish it seems transplanted straight from Dublin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Jimmy Smyth , who was released Thursday from federal custody in Pleasanton , is intriguing . <p> So is Sean 's willingness to talk , reflecting an in-your-face attitude of open support for the anti-British cause in Northern Ireland . It is a new militancy that sets the Bay Area 's Irish-heritage community apart from nearly every major Irish community in America . <p> In recent months , decades of rivalry and division have been set aside by those Bay Area Irish who support rebellion against British rule in Northern Ireland and those who would just as soon leave the bloody mess alone . <p> Nowhere was this more evident than in the local Irish community 's overwhelming support for making Smyth and three other Belfast fugitives grand marshals of this year 's St. Patrick 's Day Parade in San Francisco  --  a show of assertiveness not seen here since IRA contingents marched in the parade in 1849 . <p> ARRESTS IN BAY AREA <p> Besides Smyth , the marshals were Kevin Artt , Pol Brennan , and Terry Kirby  --  all among the 38 inmates who escaped from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jailbreak in Britain 's history . The four men , all convicted of either being involved in the IRA or participating in terrorist activities , were arrested by the FBI in the Bay Area and San Diego during the past two years . The most recent was Kirby , apprehended in February in Concord . <p> Federal authorities suspect there may be as many as six other Maze Prison escapees hiding in the Bay Area . <p> Although the Irish Republican Army decided recently to put down its weapons in favor of negotiations , the cease-fire in Northern Ireland has not dampened the fervor of local Irish Americans who support a united Ireland . <p> And they view Smyth 's release as a clear sign that they have gained momentum . <p> " I think the political winds are shifting , and they 're definitely blowing our way , " said John Fogarty , who co-chairs the H-Block Four Committee , a support group for the four Irish fugitives . " People are finally seeing that what 's been going on in Northern Ireland is wrong , that we 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political support we can from this end . " <p> VIEW FROM THE FBI <p> FBI agents and British officials call such sentiments dangerous Irish blarney . <p> They assert that activists operate an " underground railroad " in the Bay Area for Belfast fugitives needing a haven and , by extension , for support of violence against innocent people in Northern Ireland . <p> " There 's an infrastructure here for the IRA , " maintained FBI spokesman Rick Smith . " We 're not going to sit back and let these people support international terrorism . We think that some people here tend to romanticize the IRA and ignore the fact that there 's a real criminal element in Northern Ireland . " <p> U.S. District Judge Barbara Caulfield , in blocking Britain 's request to extradite Smyth , ruled that he would probably face political persecution if returned to Belfast to serve out his prison term for an attempted murder conviction . <p> As the Bay Area fugitive arrests accumulated , so did support for the imprisoned men . First there was the parade 's show of defiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike say is deeply symbolic at the very least . <p> Irish activists say all they are doing is giving political and legal aid to people who deserve it . <p> SURVEILLANCE OF IRISH <p> To date , Bay Area activists say , no FBI or British official has been able to offer evidence that local supporters have rendered illegal aid to fugitives , despite surveillance of Irish community leaders throughout the past few years . <p> Any " support network " for the fugitives is entirely " above ground , " said Fogarty . " I think people here are able to separate the issues , and they are not ready to condemn these men . And I think that 's a long way off from actually advocating violence . <p> " There 's no underground railway that I know of for moving prisoners through California , " he added . " It 's our position that this is misinformation the government is putting out to warrant the harassment of activists . " <p> But FBI agents and British officials maintain that even spoken support for the fugitives is misguided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people recognize that these are convicted felons , " said Anthony Ford , consul general at the British consulate in San Francisco . " I do n't know how many people know that a warden was killed in the escape . " <p> ROOTS OF STRUGGLE <p> The British also insist that withdrawing their troops from Northern Ireland could set off an all-out civil war between Protestants , who generally want the land to remain British-ruled " Ulster , " and Catholics , who generally want it to join the Republic of Ireland . <p> Northern Ireland , about one- fifth of the island , has a population of about 1.5 million people . Protestants outnumber Roman Catholics by a ratio of 3 to 2 . The two sides have fought for control for centuries . The British kept Northern Ireland , while granting independence to the rest of the island in 1921 . <p> Northern Ireland 's latest round of troubles began in 1968 , when a civil rights march for Catholics erupted into riots . The British sent troops to protect the Protestants ; the soldiers have remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,000 Catholics and Protestants have been killed in urban guerrilla skirmishes between the IRA , Protestant paramilitary groups , British troops and local security forces . <p> LARGE IRISH PRESENCE <p> Throughout the conflict , political and financial support from the United States ' large population of Irish descent  --  estimated at more than 50 million  --  has been regarded as vital by the rebels . And the Bay Area has long had one of the largest , and possibly the most vocal , Irish American populations in the United States . <p> A new generation of Irish immigrants has settled here in the past decade , seeking good jobs in a booming economy . Many of these new workers are from the " six counties " of Northern Ireland . Most are Catholics who still have family members living there and many consider themselves " republicans , " or supporters of a united Ireland . <p> " In recent years , San Francisco , more so than Boston or New York , seems to have been a town where those of a ' republican ' persuasion could move about quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Irish Echo newspaper in New York City . <p> ST . PATRICK 'S DAY PARADE <p> The most visible sign of that , and of the changes in the Bay Area 's Irish community , was March 's St. Patrick 's Day Parade . <p> The group mainly responsible for the pro-resistance bent of San Francisco 's parade was the United Irish Societies , a coalition of 46 Irish American organizations that range from prisoners ' rights groups to girls ' and boys ' dance , soccer and Gaelic-speaking clubs . The group chooses each year 's grand marshals by vote . <p> In rallying around the Belfast fugitives , regardless of what crimes they may have committed back home , the local Irish community put aside its history of petty feuds and reluctance to get involved in Northern Ireland 's political struggle . In past years , the grand marshals were usually local Irish Americans known for their good deeds . <p> It represented a remarkable turnaround from just the previous year , when a proposal to honor the Belfast fugitives in the 1993 parade was rebuffed , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloting was over , it yielded a watershed victory for the younger , more militant crowd . <p> " The tradition in the Irish community is that we 're born to conflict and dialogue , and that 's what happened in the grand marshal debates , " said Joe O'Donoghue , a San Francisco builder and longtime Irish community leader . " But once the vote was over , we closed ranks , because after all the enemy is not us . It 's Britain . " <p> PROTESTANT DISSENTERS <p> That sentiment is not shared by the millions of Northern Irish Protestants who have also emigrated to the United States . <p> They celebrate their alliance with the British , and although they are so heavily outnumbered that they do not openly oppose rebel sentiment in the United States , pro-British expatriates claim there are secret " Orange Order " groups all over America . <p> " The situation looks so simple when you see it from over here , but it 's not , " said John Dickson , a vocal Protestant booster who served in the British-backed Ulster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Our side has its points , too  --  and they can work things out in Northern Ireland better without interference from over here . " <p> Of the four locally jailed fugitives ' claim that they are all political prisoners , Dickson cautioned : " They may seem very nice fellows , someone has to throw the bombs . And I have pretty good faith in the British system of justice . "
