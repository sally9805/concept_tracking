<p> Step off the elevator into American Lawyer Media 's second-floor headquarters and you 'll be greeted by big , grainy black-and-white photographs of Woody Allen , Charles Manson disciple Susan Atkins and Texas cheerleader mom Wanda Holloway . They 've all been on Court TV , the heart of this fast-growing media company . <p> The framed promotional shots are reminders that trials were televised - and Court TV was there - long before O.J. Simpson was charged with the murders of his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman . <p> Court TV seems to be everywhere : It brings the Simpson murder trial to TVs across the world ; its computer on-line chat areas give legal junkies court updates and a place to trade opinions ; its founder , Steven Brill , has been profiled in several high-circulation magazines ; its trial coverage has even become a running gag on late-night talk shows . <p> More important for Court TV , the 24-hour legal-issue cable channel is now available to 18.5 million households , thanks to more channel-friendly cable rules , improving technology and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in only one-third the households CNN and MTV have , Court TV - which went on the air in July 1991 in 4 million households - is near the 20 million mark , where a cable channel can become profitable . Court TV 's owners - Brill and the nation 's two biggest cable operators , Time Warner and Tele-Communications Inc. through its Liberty Media unit - expect their first profitable quarter late this year . <p> The Simpson trial does n't get the credit . Gavel-to-gavel coverage and providing news clips for other broadcasters has increased Court TV 's visibility , but advertisers are n't charged more for their commercials . Advertising Age estimates a 30-second spot costs less than $ 1,000 . <p> " Everything we 're doing with this trial is geared toward after this trial , " Brill says . During breaks , commercials highlight Court TV 's other shows . Print ads tout Simpson coverage as only part of the channel 's repertoire . " We 're the largest legal journalism organization in the world , " Brill boasts . American Lawyer Media also publishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sells instructional videotapes and is a partner in an on-line legal research service . Its flagship publication is the monthly American Lawyer . Brill , a journalist who did n't take the bar exam after graduating from law school , started the national magazine - which has a reputation for tweaking the staid legal industry - in 1979 . <p> At the company 's Manhattan headquarters , almost everybody looks younger than 30 . The cluttered newsroom houses about 100 people , mostly reporters , producers and trial trackers who follow cases around the country . In a corner conference area , courtroom coverage is scheduled on erasable boards with color-coded markers . Brill , 44 , with an unlit Macanudo cigar in hand , presides over daily and weekly editorial meetings where trials are selected . <p> While Court TV officially says Simpson trial coverage is handled like any other case , Brill acknowledges it 's a steppingstone to recognition and profits now reserved for better-known cable channels . CNN and E ! are covering the trial live along with Court TV , while the networks show highlights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says one in four adults are watching at least some live coverage . <p> Cable channels make most of their money through fees they charge cable operators . Typically , that fee is a few cents per household - higher for the most popular channels - so more households translate directly into more revenue . As more people receive a channel , more are likely to watch , which drives up ratings and ad revenue . <p> Brill and Time Warner wo n't disclose Court TV 's revenue . But cable analyst Larry Gerbrandt of Paul Kagan Associates estimates Court TV 's revenue was about $ 22.5 million in 1993 . He predicts the Simpson trial will have a significant impact on his early estimate of $ 31.8 million in revenue for 1994 . <p> Court TV wo n't share its ratings numbers but will say late-afternoon coverage of the first week of Simpson 's trial earned a 4.2 rating compared with a 3.3 for CNN and an 0.8 for E ! among households that receive Court TV on their cable systems . Nielsen says Court TV programming has never made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A ratings point equals 954,000 TV households , so at least 4 million people watched Court TV 's coverage that week . <p> A 1992 law gave cable operators more control over what programming they could put on their limited number of open channels . Even more systems could add Court TV in the next couple of years as fiber-optic technology enables cable systems to add hundreds of channels . <p> Time Warner 's cable operators are n't required to carry Court TV even though the company has a 55% stake in the channel . But Court TV is on the cable systems of Time Warner and TCI in greater proportion than the rest of the industry , says Thayer Bigelow , president of Time Warner cable programming . <p> Court TV has fared better than some channels in getting on cable systems because viewer demand for it is high , says Lisa Meredith of the National Cable Television Association . Court TV also is available to people with satellite dishes . <p> Like most cable channels , Court TV does n't want its growth to be solely dependent on fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hike fees so much , ' says Simon Applebaum , senior editor at Cablevision magazine . <p> Among Brill 's plans for growth : <p>  --  On-line services that build visibility and viewer loyalty . Court TV has forums on America Online and Prodigy . Participants chat about everything from daily actions in Simpson 's trial to their own legal problems . One AOL option lets viewers send suggestions and requests to Court TV editors . A newer venture , Lexis Counsel Connect , lets lawyers pay to go on lineto share ideas and research . <p>  --  International and regional versions of Court TV . It has covered trials in four countries and 33 states so far . Trials get better TV ratings in areas where they take place : Joey Buttafuoco 's trial on charges of statutory rape , for example , got 2.4% of the possible Court TV viewers in New York , his hometown , compared with the 0.5% Nielsen says most daytime trial coverage earns . <p> Brill 's idea is to create a network of channels that show trials of regional interest . Court TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national interest . <p> Court TV also has a syndicated weekly program , Inside America 's Courts , that 's scheduled to go daily this fall . <p>  --  Consumer magazines . Brill dreamed up Court TV in the back of a New York cab after hearing a snippet of trial action on a radio news broadcast . He wanted to launch a legal-help magazine for consumers as a companion to American Lawyer , but things were n't going well . " I was really despondent , just could n't get it to work , " he says , and as he listened to the newscast , the idea of a courtroom network popped into his head . Now Court TV may have spurred enough interest in legal matters to make his original idea work , he says . " It may be the first time we see a print publication spawned from TV . " <p> Those plans and others might not be far off , says Time Warner 's Bigelow . While the focus now is on Court TV , " the franchise here is not simple Court TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice system through whatever medium they choose to avail themselves of , " he says . <p> Brill says though Court TV will use its base to grow , it will stick to its simple premise : a camera fixed on justice in action .
