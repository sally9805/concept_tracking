The night I nearly died closed off one of the best days fishing I 'd ever had . It was late last May , and I was shooting a TV series about Australia for PBS , the BBC and Australia 's ABC network . The crew and I had a day off in the old pearling port of Broome , on the Indian Ocean . I decided to visit one of my favorite spots on earth : Eco Beach , two hours ' drive south . On that unblemished coast I fished with a friend , Danny O'Sullivan , who had taken up guiding after a long stint in the SAS , the Australian commandos . With eight-weight fly rods and streamer flies , we went after the small bluefin tuna that boil up in schools less than a mile offshore , around 15 to 30 lbs . apiece . That day they were abundant in the sapphire water ; I hooked five , boated three and kept one . Gutted , tailed and beheaded , it went into a cooler in the back of my rented car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sashimi . Whistling gaily , I shut the gate to Eco Beach behind me and turned left on the deserted , twilit Great Northern Highway . <P> And that 's all I remember . <P> The accident happened very quickly , some two miles from the turn . What caused it is n't clear , and there were no outside witnesses . The police , who reached the scene later , claim I had drifted into the wrong lane ( Australia drives on the left ; the U.S. and Europe on the right ) , but this is n't settled . In any case , though I believe my lights were on , I did n't see the oncoming car , a Ford with three men in it . <P> What do you feel when you get whacked ? In my case , nothing , and I remember nothing , which seems weirder still but is actually normal . Doctors speak of " post-traumatic amnesia , " PTA for short , to denote this peculiar whiting out of violent episodes . The other car hit me head on but slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's side . It then spun off the road , though its occupants too , astonishingly , survived . Under such an impact , bones may not just break ; they can explode , like a cookie hit by a hammer , and that 's what happened to several of mine . <P> My catalog of trauma turned out to be a long one . Below the right knee , the tibia and fibula shattered into half a dozen pieces . The right femur broken , the ball joint at the hip damaged . The elbow of the right arm crushed . Several ribs snapped , their sharp ends driven into the lungs . Collarbone and sternum busted . What saved me was the merest fluke : apart from punctured lungs , a few picturesque cuts and some bruising to my liver and heart , the damage was all skeletal , not soft tissue . My brain was intact ; ditto my eyes , spine , guts and genitals . It could so easily have been otherwise , and in the weeks since I have sometimes thought how wildly , irrationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . With the remains of my rented Japanese car folded around me like crude origami , I was trapped , intermittently conscious but aware of no pain , and losing blood .
