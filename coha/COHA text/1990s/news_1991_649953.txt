<p> All right , superpatriots , let 's hear it for the latest American victory : <p> In the decade since 1979 , the United States has moved up from third place to become the undisputed Number One in the world , the top , unsurpassed anywhere in the punitive skills of putting its people in prison  --  more than a million of them at the moment , compared with only 769,000 in the Soviet Union . <p> This exceptional achievement is reported by the Sentencing Project , after a study of Justice Department statistics . These disclosed that , on a per capita basis , the land of the free and the home of the brave has forged well ahead even of South Africa and its apartheid system . The Afrikaners imprison only 333 people per 100,000 in their population ; in the U.S. we 're locking ' em up at the rate of 426 per 100,000 . <p> In this category , the Soviets , on the skids as they are , have fallen all the way to third : only 268 per 100,000 behind bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely because Moscow was slipping ; we Americans more than doubled our prison population in the last decade . No other nation can match that increase , or even seems to be trying . <p> A wimpy society like that of the Netherlands throws only 40 citizens per 100,000 into what it laughingly calls prison . Even a wide-open frontier country like Australia locks up only 72 . <p> Our triumph is also racial , naturally . Out of every 100,000 black males in the population , the American criminal justice system incarcerates a stunning 3,109 . In South Africa , even with its fewer constitutional protections , they only manage to imprison 729 black males per 100,000 . That 's hardly even competitive ; the U.S. actually locks up black males at a rate four times greater than apartheid . <p> What 's more , the U.S. has reached this punitive pinnacle while maintaining itself also as Number One in the commission of crimes , though figures for this activity are less reliable . But F.B.I . stats indicate that since 1980 , while the U.S. was more than doubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.5 percent . Americans still murder each other about seven times as often as Europeans , and commit three times more rapes than the West Germans . <p> The U.S. did not achieve its eminence in imprisonment without sacrifice , of course . Keeping more than a million people in custody costs states , localities and the Federal Government real money , taxpayers ' money  --  about $16 billion a year . Since around 43 percent of inmates  --  454,724 out of the 1,057,875 U.S. total  --  are black , it 's reasonable to suppose that locking up those blacks alone costs nearly $7 billion a year . <p> Some bleeding hearts , of course , might question spending that kind of money to keep people in cages , while the crime rate barely drops ; but many seem to think it cheap at the price . <p> These prison fans probably would not be shaken in their views even by another study , this one by the National Council on Crime and Delinquency . It discloses that in 1987 , when about 340,000 Americans were sent to the slam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rape or assault but for property , drug and public disorder crimes . An additional 15 percent , making 80 percent of the total , had only violated parole conditions  --  " e.g. curfew violations , failure to participate in a program , evidence of drug use etc . " <p> The report estimated that about $7 billion of total annual imprisonment costs went to " warehouse petty criminals " like these , which shows the lengths to which determined Americans will go to be Numero Uno in the lockup league . <p> There 's apparently no end in sight , either , to this league-leading status . The Crime and Delinquency Council notes that our prison population  --  not counting all those merely jailed  --  " grew by 7.3 percent between July and December 1989 . " If that terrific pace can be maintained , the report estimates , we 'll add 90,000 inmates a year , clearly staying ahead of the pack , even though 250 new cells per day will have to be added ( assuming some standard of humane conditions even for inmates ) . That rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . <p> But let 's be serious . Americans usually take pride in being Number One , but does n't this Iron Medal for imprisonment shame rather than honor us ? Do we really want to be perhaps the most punitive society in the world and certainly , as the Crime and Delinquency Council puts it , " more punitive than at any time in our history " ? Is it necessary ? <p> Stay tuned for an article mulling these questions . @x The warning came too late . <br> Mae Winslow 's finely tuned senses jumped as the fire bell rang , setting the populace into a motion akin to the stirring of a nest of hornets , and sending Mae into a fit of the vapors . <br> Before the sounding of the alarm , the only stings fair Mae felt in the bleak light of dawn were from her heart and her conscience . She had disappointed dear Henry once again , allowing the calamity that dogged her steps to set her on yet another path leading away from the home and hearth he so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath her buckskin-clad exterior beat a heart that held nothing but love for him despite the vagabond life she must lead . <br> At the moment , however , her mind must turn from the excess of emotional thoughts that Henry Darling brought and toward the situation at hand . With the practiced eye of one far too well-trained in the ways of desperate outlaws and lowly curs , she lifted the sash of the boardinghouse window and lowered her gaze to the street <br> below . With the fresh wind came the bitter scent of smoke . Alas , the odor did not emit from below or from beyond the bounds of the quaint structure , but rather swirled from behind , as if seeping beneath the slightly crooked bedroom door . <br> Mae made to turn when a shot rang out . A bullet chipped away several layers of paint on the sill and sent her scrambling to the floor . There , with her breath coming a bit freer , she crawled toward the bed , where her pistols hung on the bedpost . <br> " So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers around the cold metal that had saved her life more times than she could count , " they 've found me . " <br> New York City , July 5 , 1880 <br> Something tickled her nose . Eugenia Flora Cooper batted at the offending object , then opened her eyes to see that she 'd tossed a fringed pillow onto her bedroom floor . A thud told her the book she 'd been reading last night had gone flying as well . <br> The book , a brand-new episode of Mae Winslow , Woman of the West . Gennie sighed and pulled the silk and velvet coverlet over her head as she snuggled down into the soft feather mattress . Despite the fact she was required to attend a post  --  Independence Day breakfast with the Vanowens this morning , then catch a train to Boston at noon , she 'd devoured every word of the dime novel last evening , staying awake late into the night . <br> After completing Mae 's latest adventure , Gennie reluctantly closed her eyes . Even then , the story continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been running alongside a moving train full of stolen gold , her borrowed cowboy boots dangerously close to tripping her , when the dream abruptly ended . And , like Mae , she 'd been fleeing the bonds of a man bent on prematurely tying her to home and hearth . Gennie , like Mae , could admit no real aversion to marriage and family . In fact , she welcomed the idea of a life spent in such a way . Just not yet . <br> Like Mae . <br> Perhaps that was what drew her to Mae 's stories over other novels . It seemed Mae was the only woman whose books never quite ended with a happily ever after . Each one promised it could be  --  even should be  --  and then the adventure took a turn , and so did Mae . By the end of the book , the bad guys were caught but Mae was not . <br> Someday , if Gennie ever had the nerve , she 'd just head west down Fifth Avenue and keep walking until she reached South Dakota or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gold or dig for silver . Maybe save some hapless child or even a whole town from whatever evil preyed upon it . <br> Gennie smiled . Would n't that be an adventure ? <br> Of course , Mama and Papa would miss her , but what a time she 'd have riding runaway horses and fending off savage beasts with nothing but a broom and three wet matches . It would certainly be more interesting than painting flowers on china plates or embroidering her initials on handkerchiefs . Mama always had despaired of her stitching . <br> At the thought of her mother , Gennie bolted upright . It would never do for her choice of reading material to become common knowledge , even though she 'd never understood the condemnation dime novels drew among her social set . Mae 's adventures were tame compared to stories she read in the Bible . Surely the Lord smiled equally on the authors of such wholesome entertainment and on those who wrote more scholarly works . <br> Still , she should probably fetch the book and hide it with the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and draw her bath . Her secret had been safe with her previous maid , Mary . The dear Irish- woman carried off the books once Gennie read them . She claimed to be tossing them into a trash bin , but Gennie knew better . At least Mary had n't informed Simmons , who would have told her parents at <br> the first opportunity . Anything Simmons knew was destined for Papa 's ear before the day ended , which was why Papa paid the elderly houseman so well . <br> But then Mama and Papa , along with fourteen-year-old Connor , were safely aboard ship heading for their silver anniversary tour of the Continent . Gennie smiled and sank back into her cocoon of blankets . Surely a maid stumbling over a dime novel was beyond their concern . Perhaps she 'd read the next dime novel in the drawing room instead of under her covers . <br> Opening one eye , she peered across the pile of pillows and through the bed drapes to see only the faintest glow of daylight at the edge of the curtains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few more minutes and I 'll " She snuggled deeper into her pillow and closed her eyes . <br> " Miss Cooper , you 've fallen back to sleep . Do wake up . " <br> A blinding shaft of light intruded on her slumber , and Gennie fumbled for a pillow to cover her face . Finding none within reach , she struggled into a sitting position . <br> " I 'm sorry , miss , " the maid said , " but it 's half past ten . " " Half past ten ? " Gennie sputtered , suddenly alert . " How in the world will I explain to Mrs. Vanowen why I missed such an important event as her post  --  Independence Day breakfast ? " <br> Gennie fought her way through the bed curtains and reached for her robe . As she tied the sash , she began to pace , carefully avoiding the pillows strewn across the Aubusson carpet . She 'd also have to explain her absence to Chandler Dodd , although that prospect did n't upset her nearly as much as disappointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said as she drifted toward the easternmost window and glanced at the mid- morning rush on Fifth Avenue three stories below . " He so coveted a place on Mrs. Vanowens 's list for Mama , and with this snub , she 'll certainly be overlooked next time . " Mae Winslow , on the other hand , cared little for such frippery . If only <br> " So sorry , miss . " The hapless maid , Mary 's replacement , ducked her head and inched forward , the silver tray she held wobbling with each step . " You see , there 's been a most upsetting problem with my sister 's departure , and I  --  " <br> " Never mind . " Gennie gave the tray a cursory glance , then pointed to the dressing table nearest the window overlooking the park . " Perhaps you 'd like to tell all of this to our neighbor . " She paused as the maid 's eyes filled with tears . Gennie sighed . " Forgive me . I 'm being awful . I 'm exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank . This was no way to begin with a new employee . " What 's your name ? " <br> The dark-haired girl fixed her attention on her shoes . " Fiona , miss . Fiona McTaggart . " <br> " Perhaps there 's no harm done , Fiona . " Gennie seated herself at the writing desk and pulled a sheet of paper from the drawer . <br> Crafting two notes of regret that included only vague mentions of any specifics of her condition , she dried the ink , folded the paper , and then set her seal on the edge . When the wax hardened , she held the notes out to Fiona . <br> " Have Simmons send someone to deliver these , please . " She paused to set her tone in what she hoped was a mix of understanding and firmness . " And then perhaps we will both be forgiven for our transgressions . " <br> The girl grinned , then quickly seemed to remember her place . " You 're every bit as nice as Mr. Simmons said you 'd be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pardon , miss , but I 'd be ever so grateful if you 'd not mention I forgot to wake you . I 'm afraid I 'd be out on my ear after my first day , and with my sister 's leaving us this afternoon , I do n't know how I 'd take care of my mama and my ailing papa . " <br> " Of course , I wo n't mention it . There 'd be no purpose to it . " <br> As Fiona scurried out , Gennie rose and turned her attention back to the scene unfolding on the street below . Several drivers had arrived with carriages , and liveried attendants milled about beneath a brilliant blue sky . <br> She let her gaze drift across the street and up the marble steps of the imposing mansion that sat on the corner like a wedding cake . The Vanowens ' third floor ballroom stood at eye level , floor-to-ceiling windows open to the fresh July breeze . A lone figure swept the marble floor where , as a child , Gennie and her friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their stocking feet . <br> Gennie 's family returned the favor when Hester accompanied them to their house in Newport , where the long upstairs hallway opened onto a balcony that overlooked the lawn and the ocean beyond . Little imagination was required to believe that with just a bit of extra effort , one might be able to launch over the balcony 's edge and soar into the clouds . <br> Hester only attempted it once , and thankfully the thick foliage broke her fall . Even better was that Mama and Papa were away at the time . <br> " May the Lord bless you , miss . Perhaps you 'd like me to pour your coffee now ? " <br> Gennie turned to see the door close behind the maid . " Yes , Fiona . Please do . " <br> A flurry of activity across the street again caught her attention . <br> Continues ...
