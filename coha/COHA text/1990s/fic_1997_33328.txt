Enter Madame It must have been around a quarter to eleven . A sailor came in and ordered a chile dog and coffee . I sliced a bun , jerked a frank out of the boiling water , nested it , poured a half-dipper of chile over the frank and sprinkled it liberally with chopped onions . I scribbled a check and put it by his plate . I would n't have recommended the unpalatable mess to a starving animal . The sailor was the only customer , and after he ate his dog he left . That was the exact moment she entered . A small woman , hardly more than five feet . She had the figure of a teen-age girl . Her suit was a blue tweed , smartly cut , and over her thin shoulders she wore a fur jacket , bolero length . Tiny gold circular earrings clung to her small pierced ears . Her hands and feet were small , and when she seated herself at the counter I noticed she was n't wearing any rings . She was pretty drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I believe I need coffee . " She steadied herself on the stool by bracing her hands against the edge of the counter . " Yes , you do , " I agreed , " and you need it black . " I drew a cupful and set it before her . The coffee was too hot for her to drink and she bent her head down and blew on it with comical little puffs . I stood behind the counter watching her . I could n't help it ; she was beautiful . Even Benny , from his seat behind the cash register , was staring at her , and his only real interest is money . She was n't nearly as young as I had first thought her to be . She was about twenty-six or - seven . Her fine blonde hair was combed straight back . Slightly to the right of a well-defined widow's-peak , an inch-wide strip of silver hair glistened , like a moonlit river flowing through night fields . Her oval face was unlined and very white . The only make-up she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so dark it was almost black . She looked up from her coffee and noticed that I was staring at her . Her eyes were a charred sienna-brown , flecked with dancing particles of shining gold . " This coffee is too hot . " She smiled good-humoredly . " Sure it is , " I replied , " but if you want to sober up you should drink it hot as you can . " " My goodness ! Who wants to sober up ? " Benny was signaling me from the cash register . I dropped my conversation with the girl to see what he wanted . Benny was a flat , bald , hook-nosed little man with a shaggy horseshoe of gray hair circling his head . I did n't particularly like him , but he never pushed or tried to boss me and I 'd stuck it out as his counterman for more than two months . For me , this was a record . His dirty eyes were gleaming behind his gold-rimmed glasses . " There 's your chance , Harry ! " He laughed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant . About two weeks before a girl had entered the cafe at closing time and she had been pretty well down on her luck . She 'd been actually hungry and Benny had had me fix her up with a steak and french fries . Afterwards , he had made her pay him for the meal by letting him take it out in trade in the kitchen . " I do n't need any advice from you , " I said angrily . He laughed again , deep in his chest . " It 's quitting time . Better take advantage . " He climbed down from his stool and walked stiffly to the door . He shot the bolt and hung the CLOSED sign from the hook . I started toward the kitchen and as I passed the woman she shook her empty cup at me . " See ? All finished . May I have another ? " I filled her cup , set it in front of her and went into the back room and slipped into my tweed jacket . The jacket was getting ratty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my trenchcoat , and I 'd worn it for more than two years . The elbows were thin and the buttons , except one , were missing . The good button was the top one and a coat looks funny buttoned at the top . I resolved to move it to the middle in the morning . My blue gabardine trousers had n't been cleaned for three weeks and they were spotted here and there with grease . I had another pair of trousers in my room , but they were tuxedo trousers , and I used them on waiter and busboy jobs . Sober , I was always embarrassed about my appearance , but I did n't intend to stay sober very long . I combed my hair and I was ready for the street , a bar and a drink . She was still sitting at the counter and her cup was empty again . " Just one more and I 'll go , " she said with a drunken little laugh . " I promise . " For the third time I gave her a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going over his receipts for the day . I tapped him on the shoulder . " Benny , I need a ten until payday , " I told him . " Not again ? I let you have ten last night and today 's only Tuesday . By Saturday you wo n't have nothing coming . " You do n't have to worry about it . " He took his copy-book from under the counter and turned to my page . After he entered the advance in the book he reluctantly gave me a ten dollar bill . I folded the bill and put it in my watch pocket . I felt a hand timidly tugging at my sleeve and I turned around . The little woman was looking up at me with her big blue innocent eyes . " I have n't any money , " she said bitterly . " Is that right ? " " Not a penny . Are you going to call a policeman ? " " Ask Mr. Freeman . He 's the owner ; I just work here . " " What 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . He was in the middle of his count and did n't like to be disturbed . " This young lady is unable to pay for her coffee . " " Coffee is ten cents , " he said firmly . " I 'll tell you what , Benny . Just take it out of my pay . " " Do n't think I wo n't ! " He returned to his counting . I unlocked the door , and the woman and I went outside . " You 're a free woman , " I said to the girl . " You 're lucky that Benny did n't notice you were without a purse when you came in . Where is your purse , by the way ? " " I think it 's in my suitcase . " " All right . Where 's your suitcase ? " " It 's in a locker . I 've got the key . " She took a numbered key out of the pocket of her fur jacket . " The main trouble is that I ca n't seem to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus station . " She was genuinely puzzled . " If I were you I 'd look in the bus station first . You 're quite a ways from the railroad station . Do you know where it is ? " " The bus station ? " " Yes . It 's seven blocks that way and one block that way . " I pointed down Market Street . " You ca n't miss it . I 'm going to have a drink . " " Would you mind buying me one too ? " " Sure . Come on . " She took my arm and we walked down Market . It was rather pleasant having a beautiful woman in tow and I was glad she had asked me to buy her a drink . I would never have asked her , but as long as she did n't mind , I certainly did n't mind . I shortened my stride so she could keep up with me and from time to time I looked down at her . Gin was my weakness , not women , but with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a man think . We were nearing the bar where I always had my first drink after work and my mind returned to more practical things . We entered , found seats at the end of the bar . " Say , " she said brightly . " I remember being in here tonight ! " " That 's fine . It 's a cinch you were in some bar . " The bartender knew me well , but his eyebrows lifted when he saw the girl with me . " What 'll you have , Harry ? " he asked . " Double gin and tonic . " I turned to the girl . " I 'd better not have a double . Give me a little shot of bourbon and a beer chaser . " She smiled at me . " I 'm being smart , are n't I ? " " You bet . " I lit two cigarettes and passed her one . She sucked it deeply . " My name is Harry Jordan , " I said solemnly . " I 'm thirty-two years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her laugh closely resembled a tinkling bell . " My name is Helen Meredith . I 'm thirty-three years old and I do n't work at all . I drink all of the time . " " You 're not thirty-three , are you ? I took you for about twenty-six , maybe less . " " I 'm thirty-three all right , and I ca n't forget it . " " Well , you 've got an advantage on me then . Married ? " " Uh huh . I 'm married , but I do n't work at that either . " She shrugged comically . I stared at her delicate fingers as she handled the cigarette . The bartender arrived with our drinks . Mine was good and cold and the gin taste was strong . The way I like it . I love the first drink best of all . " Two more of the same , " I told the bartender , " and see if Mrs. Meredith 's purse was left here , will you ? " " I have n't seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here , miss ? " he asked Helen worriedly . " I 'm not sure of anything , " she replied . " Well , I 'll take a look around . Maybe you left it in a booth . " " Helen Meredith , " I said , when the bartender left . " Here 's to you ! " We clicked our glasses together and drained them down . Helen choked a bit and followed her shot down with the short beer chaser . " Ahhh , " she sighed . " Harry , I 'm going to tell you something while I 'm still able to tell you . I have n't lived with my husband for more than ten years , and even though I do n't wear a ring , I 'm still married . " " You do n't have to convince me . " " But I want to tell you . I live with my mother in San Sienna . Do you know where that is ? " " Sure . It 's a couple of hundred miles down the coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing else . " " That 's right . Well as I told you , I drink . In the past two years I 've managed to embarrass Mother many times . It 's a small community and we 're both well-known , so I decided the best thing to do was get out . This morning I was half-drunk , half-hungover , and I bought a bottle and I left . For good . But I hit the bottle so hard I 'm not sure whether I came to San Francisco on the bus or on the train . " " I 'm willing to lay odds of two to one it was the bus . " " You 're probably right . I really do n't remember . " The bartender brought us our second drink . He shook his head emphatically . " You did n't leave no purse in here , miss . You might 've thought you did , but you did n't . " " Thanks for looking , " I told him . " After we finish this one , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus station and I 'll find your purse for you . Then you 'd better head back for San Sienna and Mother . " Helen shook her head back and forth slowly . " No . I 'm not going back . Never . " " That 's your business . Not mine . " We finished our second drink and left the bar . It was a long walk to the bus station . Market Street blocks are long and crowded . Helen hung on to my arm possessively , and by the time we reached the station she had sobered considerably . The place was jampacked with servicemen of all kinds and a liberal sprinkling of civilians . The Greyhound station is the jumping-off place for servicemen . San Francisco is the hub for all the spokes leading to air bases , navy bases and army posts that dot the bay area . " Does the bus station look familiar to you ? " " Of course ! " She laughed . " I 've been to San Francisco many times . I always come up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little foolish . " Let 's start looking then . " She handed me the numbered key . There are a lot of parcel lockers inside the Greyhound station and many more out on the waiting ramp , but in a few minutes we were able to locate the locker . It was in the first row to the left of the Ladies ' Room . I inserted the key and opened the locker . I took the suitcase out of the locker and handed it to Helen . She unsnapped the two catches on the aluminum over-nighter and raised the lid . Her tiny hands ruffled deftly through the clothing . There was n't any purse . I looked . No purse . I felt around inside the locker . No purse . " Do you suppose I could have left it in some other bar , Harry ? " she asked me worriedly . " Somewhere between here and the cafe ? " " That 's probably what you did , all right . And if you did , you can kiss it goodbye . How much money did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but drunk or sober I would n't have left San Sienna broke . I know I had some traveler 's checks . " I took my money out of my watch pocket . There were eight dollars and seventy cents . I gave the five dollar bill to Helen . " This five 'll get you a ticket back to San Sienna . You 'd better get one . " Helen shook her head vigorously this time and firmly set her mouth . " I 'm not going back , Harry . I told you I was n't and I meant it ! " She held the bill out to me . " Take it back ; I do n't want it . " " No , you go ahead and keep it . We 'll consider it a loan . But I 'm going to take you to a hotel . If I turned you loose you 'd drink it up . " " It did n't take you long to get to know me , did it ? " She giggled . " I do n't know you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come on , we 'll find a hotel . " I picked up the light suitcase and we left the station . We crossed Market Street and at Powell we turned and entered the first hotel that looked satisfactory to me . There are more than a dozen hotels on Powell Street , all of them adequate , and it was our best bet to find a vacancy . The hotel we entered was furnished in cheap modern furniture and the floor was covered with a rose wall-to-wall carpet . There were several green plants scattered about , all of them set in white pots with wrought-iron legs , and by each foam-cushioned lobby chair , there were skinny , black wrought-iron ash-stands . We crossed the empty lobby to the desk and I set the bag on the floor . The desk clerk was a fairly young man with sleek black hair . He looked up from his comic book with surly gray eyes . " Sorry , " he said flatly . " No doubles left . Just singles . " " That 's fine , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen signed the register card . Her handwriting was cramped and it slanted to the left , almost microscopic in size . She put the pen back into the holder and folded her arms across her chest . " The lady will pay in advance , " I said to the clerk , without looking at Helen . She frowned fiercely for a second , then in spite of herself , she giggled and gave the clerk the five dollar bill . He gave her two ones in return . The night clerk also doubled as a bell boy and he came out from behind the desk with Helen 's key in his hand . " You want to go up now ? " he asked Helen , pointedly ignoring me . " I 've still got two dollars , " Helen said to me . " I 'll buy you a drink ! " " No . You go to bed . You 've had enough for one day . " " I 'll buy you one tomorrow then . " " Tomorrow will be time enough , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were heavy . It was difficult for her to hold them open . In the warmth of the lobby she was beginning to stagger a little bit . The night clerk opened the door to the self-operated elevator and helped her in , holding her by the arm . I selected a comfortable chair near the desk and waited in the lobby until he returned . He did n't like it when he saw me sitting there . " Do you think she 'll manage all right ? " I asked him . " She managed to lock her door after I left , " he replied dryly . " Fine . Good night . " I left the hotel and walked up Powell as far as Lefty 's , ordered a drink at the bar . It was dull , drinking alone , after drinking with Helen . She was the most attractive woman I had met in years . There was a quality about her that appealed to me . The fact that she was an alcoholic did n't make any difference to me . In a way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit that she was a drunk ; she was well aware of it , and she did n't have any intention to stop drinking . It was n't necessary for her to tell me she was a drunk . I can spot an alcoholic in two minutes . Helen was still a good-looking woman , and she 'd been drinking for a long time . I never expected to see her again . If I wanted to , I suppose it would have been easy enough . All I had to do was go down to her hotel in the morning , and ... I finished my drink quickly and left the bar . I did n't feel like drinking any more . I crossed the street and waited for my cable car . In a few minutes it dragged up the hill , slowed down at the corner , and I jumped on . I gave the conductor my fare and went inside where it was warmer . Usually , I sat in the outside section where I could smoke , but I was cold that night , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided it would be best to steer clear of a woman like Helen .
