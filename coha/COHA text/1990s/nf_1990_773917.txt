txt // realm of actuality and experience . If one contrasts the two ' real 's representing the duality of li and ki in terms of being above the level of concrete forms and within concrete form as assumed by T'oegye up to D , then li , which is above forms , would belong to the categories of concept and logic , while ki , which is within concrete form , would belong to the realm of experience . Therefore saying li is a real principle and cause amounts to a denial of his own initial assumption regarding the manner of distintion between li and ki . This is the source of the confusion involved in the concept of li itself . The li spoken of in E , then , does not mean just a real cause ; it means li in the sense of a cause real on the level above concrete form . If we apply the same contrast we used above to the expression " a cause real on the level above concrete form " it would mean " something as belonging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm of experience " . Therefore it is unmistakable that the reason confusion arises in his differentiation of li and ki is due to the fact that his concept of li combines these two contradictory characteristics . That is , what makes it difficult to distinguish li from ki when he says that in its function li can be characterized as active is the fact that he believes li to be something real , and this is likewise the reason we found his notion of the function of li ending in the meaningless thesis of substance and function being of a single origin . 3 . Contradictions in the Premises Furthermore the idea that li is prior to the existence of li ( premise G ) is fundamentally based on the reality of li ( E ) ; it can only introduce confusion between the concepts of li and ki and could never be accepted . We can see how this works out as follows . As we have already seen , premise G , according to which li is prior to the existence of ki , was originally formulated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then although there may not yet be the concrete thing , there is already the li of the thing , so likewise there is just li without there ever having been the creature " . That is , in G the condition , " considered // from the point of view of li " was operative . It was a statement that established G only from the exclusive viewpoint of li . As li was earlier interpreted , it meant " reason " o : " logic " . The acceptability of G is entirely limited to the level of rationale or logic and can never be taken on the level of experience . His vocabulary for expressing the level of experience is , " from the point of view of concrete things " . Then what would this amount to , " considered from the point of view of concrete things " ? T'oegye himself had already said , " Considered from the point of view of concrete things , then the two i.e. li and ki are mixed together and can not be distinguished ; they combine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ki can never be differentiated ; consequently it is impossible to say one is prior and the other latter . Clearly then premise G is being used at the experiential level , since it is the premise of the conclusion H , which treats of the world of experience . Even though G differentiates li and ki in terms of the priority of ii , it is presented from the point of view of the experiential level . Therefore it must be said that in G T'oegye ignores the " from the viewpoint of li " condition that he himself specified . It follows that if one accepts G here confusion between the concepts of li and ki is inevitable . Ultimately in accepting G in respect to the proposition that the Supreme Ultimate gives rise to the two forms T'oegye commits two mistakes . Having come to think of li itself as a prior real cause , li takes on an experiential character which is already in contradiction with its original character . That is , it has the same character as ki . The other mistake is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable only from the point of view of li , but with respect to the Supreme Ultimate giving rise to the two forms he takes it on the experiential level , that is , the level of ki . That is why earlier we saw that when he assumes that li is the cause that is prior to the existence of ki and produces it , the proposition that the Supreme Ultimate gives rise to the two forms leads to a monism of ki . Looked at in this way , the conclusion that li gives rise to ki , i.e. , T'oegye 's view of the Supreme Ultimate 's giving rise to the two forms , clearly brings about a confusion between the concepts of li and ki. // Therefore even when T'oegye takes the Supreme Ultimate 's giving rise to the two forms in the sense of " the Supreme Ultimate moves and yang accordingly arises " , the foundation of his position involves these contradictory points and so simply can not be accepted as a realistic position . V. Conclusion As we have already pointed out , T'oegye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Ultimate gives rise to the two forms it introduces points of contradiction into a li/ki dualism . That is why he applied the substance/function thesis to his position on li as active . Then why did he not abandon this assertion even when he understood all this ? First of all , one might suppose that he thought he could overcome the contradictions with the " wonder of substance and function being of a single origin " sort of logic . In this respect it seems that he is borrowing the sort of logic frequently used by Buddhists in assertions such as , " form is emptiness , emptiness is form " . If one considers that Neo-Confucian thought itself was formed under Buddhist influence there is nothing particularly surprising in this . The problem is , why then did he have to use the word " wonder " ? Was not his feeling the need to add the word " wonder " due to a suspicion that there was something inadequate about the proposition that substance and function are of a single origin ? But then why could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must have been because it bore some great import for his ultimate philosophical objective or for his entire philosophical system . In other words , we can infer that he felt that the meaning of this assertion was so great that it could not be traded just in order to avoid the logical shortcomings . If we accept this inference we can perhaps take a somewhat more tolerant stance regarding the assertion 's theoretical inadequacies . In fact , going back we recall that the meaning of li originally was not only the causal " that by which things are as they are " , but also the normative li of // " how things ought to be " . Therefore in respect to any theory discussing li , its fit in an entire philosophical system can be judged only after an investigation of its significance in the realm of moral values.191 With this in mind one can not simply say that a suitable theoretical argument can not be made for T'oegye 's position on the Supreme Ultimate giving rise to the two forms and immediately dismiss it as valueless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I introduced this topic . Moreover in our consideration the question has been posed mainly with emphasis upon li . As a result in his approach to li and ki what has come out here is especially contradictions implicit in the handling of li . Some might be led by this to the hasty conclusion that the weaknesses in his theory are all on the side of li . But this kind of conclusion must be postponed until there has been a thorough investigation of his treatment of ki . The need for this is already suggested by what we have seen here about the problem of the production or arising of ki . In this investigation we have at least clearly indicated that in T'oegye 's approach to li and ki there are points of contradiction in the handling of li . It is enough if this can serve as a stimulus to correction and development in at least that area . No matter how highly we may come to regard the value and meaningfulness of this position of T'oegye 's after this , insofar as it is a theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its meaningfulness more effective . 84 Chapter 3 The Four Seven Debate : T'oegye 's View of the Mind-and-Heart and the Nature I. Introduction The period in T'oegye 's life when he became famous as a scholar dated from the elaboration of his position on the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings in what has come to be known as the " Four Seven Debate . " T'oegye 's position gave rise to a debate that was carried on with Kobong ( Ki Taesung , 1527  --  72 ) in correspondence that stretched out over more than 8 years . Then it became the focal point of debate and discussion throughout the Korean intellectual world . The Four Seven Debate is easily the most famous controversy in Korean Confucian thought , and its formative influence on the intellectual discourse of latter centuries can hardly be overestimated . After T'oegye 's death it eventually split Korean Confucian thought into two main traditions generally contrasted as typically emphasizing either the li or the ki side of the Ii/ki dualism . Tied in with regional loyalties , these became known as the Yongnam ( i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. Kyonggi and Ch'ungch'ong provinces ) schools respectively . Thus the most distinctive features of the Korean Confucian tradition stem from T'oegye 's Four Seven thesis ; his thought is rich and merits study from many angles , but if one is concerned with its influence on the Korean intellectual tradition there is nothing more important than his discussion of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings . // This is all the more the case insofar as the question of the distinctive adaptation or acculturation of the Confucian tradition in Korea has become important in the contemporary mind . If by acculturation one means the development of distinctive characteristics , then it can certainly be said that the Four Seven Debate introduced by T'oegye constitutes one of the main distinctive features of the Korean Confucian tradition and Korean appropriation of Neo-Confucian thought . Thus study of this aspect of T'oegye 's thought will at the same time give us insight into the characteristically Korean development of the Neo-Confucian tradition . Whatever else one may say about the form or content of the Four Seven Debate , it indubitably centers on theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental theory of the mind-and-heart and the nature are an appropriate starting place for an investigation of his Four Seven position . Moreover since his theory as regards the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings pivots on the question of interpreting them in terms of li and ki , we will also have to look into his theory of li and ki as it applies to the context of the mind-and-heart and the nature . We shall examine T'oegye 's position on these matters in some detail , considering its premises and pursuing the question of its precise meaning . Throughout the four centuries since T'oegye 's Four Seven position first gave rise to Kobong 's counterposition this debate has been the object of continued controversy . In part this may be due to the inherently problematic nature of the questions involved , but in part it is likewise due to the fact that the language and expressions used at the time were unclear , involving ambiguities and differences of meanings depending on the different positions and premises from which they were used . If our investigation is successful we may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding some of the problematic points we have seen in T'oegye 's usage of li . In his original application of substance/function to li , the function aspect remains as a problem . That is , its function points to its ability to act and to produce , and as we have already seen this active and productive nature involves unacceptable points of contradiction and irrationality . As I mentioned in concluding the last chapter , although it may he in fact irrational , on the level of // values T'oegye 's point here may be quite meaningful . In this chapter we shall see that T'oegye interprets the Four Beginnings as the " issuance ( pal , fa ) " of li . So the function of li now extends to giving issuance : For the matter of being without feelings or intent etc. refers to 1i 's original substance , while its being able to issue and to give rise to feelings is a matter of its exceedingly marvelous and mysterious function . ( TGCS. , A , 39.286 ) Therefore if we succeed in carrying out this analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beginnings and Seven Feelings , unraveling the meaning of li as issuing or giving issuance will disclose what T'oegye means when he characterizes li as active or as giving rise to something . Tlhis we can hope will be one of the important corollaries to understand-ing his handling of the issues in the Four Seven Debate . II . T'oegye 's Fundamental View of the Mind-and-Heart and the Nature 1 . Definition of the Mind-and-Heart According to T'oegye what is signified by the Chinese character for heart or mind-and-heart , " sim ( Chin . hsin ) , " can never be considered just a lump of flesh and blood " ( TGCS. , A , 29.7a ) . The ancients thought of the physical heart as the mind-and-heart , but here one can see that T'oegye does not identify the mind-and-heart with a particular physical organ like the heart . Of course he would not deny the original physical denotation of the term , which was interchangeable with the expression , " the two square inches " , that is , the space within the breast occupied by the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book of Odes to // indicate it is much more than a mere physical organ : " For the sim is the abode where the spiritual intelligences arise and descend " ' ( TGCS. , A , 29.7a ) . The physical organ is nothing but the locus whence the functioning of the mind-and-heart arises . But in saying that the mind-and-heart is not fashioned of flesh and blood does one not imply that its stuff is fundamentally different from the elements that make up the physical body ? In fact he says : " Although all talking about the sim certainly involves a reference to the two square inches ' , nonetheless its substance and its function fill all of space in every direction " ( ibid . ) . The space it fills can be measured not only in terms of the human chest cavity , but also in terms of the whole universe . Ultimately it seems that what he here is contrasting with the physical in respect to the sim is consciousness or the general conscious functions . For consciousness or its functions are powers that stem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is consciousness of both oneself and of all the other things of the universe . This is the mind-and-heart that T'oegye terms the master of one 's entire person ' : Indeed , combining substance and function and including both activity and quiescence , serving as the master of the entire person and revolving ceaselessly as in a circle with no beginning , such is the character of the mind-and-heart . ( TGCS. , A , 10.23a ) " Master " is a term that indicates the function of managing or controlling . Therefore being " master of the entire person " more than anything means making all the capacities of the body function in a unified way as occasion demands so that the individual will be functioning harmoniously . But this is not limited to just unified control of activity on the level of the body 's organic mechanisms . For T'oegye 's interest was never in the direction of doing psychological studies oriented towards understanding the body 's activities as an organic function or biological mechanism . For him the mastery involved in being master of the entire person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enables an individual to act by deliberate choice . What , then , does control in order to act this way mean ? T'oegye says that " the mind-and-heart issues ( pal , fa ) as will ( ui , i ) ; the // will is the issuance of the mind-and-heart " ( TGCS. , A , 36.15b ) . From its usage in the famous first chapter of the Doctrine of the Mean the term pal has meant the beginning of activity in the mind-and-heart , or the presence/absence of such activity as in the phrases that describe the two primary conditions or states of the mind-and-heart , " already aroused ( pal ) " and " not yet aroused ( pal ) " . Therefore this statement could easily be understood to mean that the mind-and-heart and the will are synonymous . But that is not the case . In the same passage he says : Therefore it is not only the will that is the issuance of the mind-andheart ; the issuance of the feelings is likewise the doing of the mind-andheart ... Former Confucians regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature 's issuance . Will is a matter of insisting something should be a particular way , and so they called it the issuance of the mind-and-heart . In each case they spoke in line with the particular characteristics . Will , then , is but one function of the mind-and-heart . Mind-and-heart , we may say , is a general concept , while will is a particular one . It 's just that the distinctive characteristic of the will as involving insisting on something is similar to the mind-and-heart 's characteristic of exercising mastery . Thus when thinking explicitly about this similarity of characteristics T'oegye says that the mind-and-heart issues as the will and the will is the issuance of the mind-and-heart . That is , he says the mind issues as will in the sense that the will directly manifests the basic function of the mind-and-heart as exercising mastery or control . T'oegye discusses the will as follows : As for the matter of intention ( chi , chih ) and will , Chu Hsi says that the intention is where the mind-and-heart goes straightaway , while the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it likewise insists on something .... As in the case of your inclination to go off on a long trip without considering its danger or difficulty ; that is intention . The mindand-heart 's issuing a thought in view of the matter as to how one should handle it , that is the will . ( TGCS. , A , 29.15a ) And again : Therefore the boat or wagon may he compared to the feelings , and the driver directing the boat or wagon may he compared to the will . ( TGCS ... Chapter 3 . The Four Seven Debate 89 A , 36.16a ) So the condition in which desire is directed towards the future or some particular object is called intention , and will is that which calculates , controls , and decides regarding this spontaneous desire or intention . Thus T'oegye compares the feelings to the vehicle and the will to the driver . So we can see from this consideration of will that being " master of the entire person " is a matter of exercising control over all the demands of desire , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . The mind-and-heart , then , is basically associated with this kind of ability or the general kind of phenomena that are manifested in connection with this kind of ability . 2 . The Li/Ki Characteristics of the Mind-and-Heart Typical of the Neo-Confucian learning of the nature and principle ' , whatever the phenomenon may be , T'oegye interprets it in terms of li and ki . And to be sure , psychological phenomena are included in the realm of what may be so interpreted and explained . In this school of thought the mind-and-heart itself is defined as a composite of li and ki . In Chapter 2 we considered at some length T'oegye 's understanding of li and ki.2 ) What aspects of the mind-and-heart , then , will be manifested by li and ki so conceived ? Since the mind-and-heart is described as a compo site of li and ki , what are its li/ki characteristics ? Rationality Fundamentally T'oegye follows Ch'eng Yi 's position that equates the nature with li : " For the nature is not a thing , but just the li endowed within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other words , this li of the mind-and-heart really amounts to just another application of the general idea of li as that with which things are endowed . The li with which things are endowed is something like its most fundamental essence // or nature . Accordingly we can see that the li of man 's mind-and-heart means the fundamental human essence , man 's original nature . In fact , the nature , in the words of the famous first chapter of the Doctrine of the Mean , is that which is mandated by Heaven : " The Heavenly Mandate is what is called the nature . " This refers to the fundamental or " original " nature that one possesses from birth . T'oegye is saying that the li of the mind-and-heart constitutes this kind of original human nature . This nature with its pristine original perfection is what he and other Neo-Confucians call the " original nature . " But when T'oegye speaks of the original nature it is premised on a condition : It is just considered in itself with no admixture of material stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature ; if one takes into account the material component , then it is the physical nature . ( TGCS. , A , 35.28a ) The original nature is thus considered completely apart from the material component . If the relationship with matter is taken into account it becomes the " physical nature . " What leads to this is that the original nature refers to things ' abstract , general distinctive characteristics , while the physical nature is a matter of concrete , individual characteristics.31 Since the original nature is considered apart from its relationship to matter it is pure li and hence said to be purely good . And the physical nature , which reflects the characteristics of ki or matter , is spoken of as neither good nor evil ( TGCS. , A , 16.10a ) . Thus the li of the mind-and-heart , as the original nature , becomes the norm for activity on the concrete , physical ( ki ) level : The Letter on Settling One 's nature ' ) says : " Man 's mind-and-heart acts changeably and is difficult to control . Anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If when one is angry one can forget his anger and look to what is right or wrong according to li , then likewise he will be able to see that external provocations are not worth bothering about . " Indeed , // shall we say it is li that he describes as acting changeably and being difficult to control ? Or is it ki ? ? ? ? It is just a matter of the issuance of ki , and hence he says to forget one 's anger and look to li ; this means to control ki in terms of li . ( TGCS. , A , 16. 37a-b ) For example , when one has become angry what prevents it from bringing evil results is one 's power of discerning right and wrong owing to li , that is the nature as normative . This good outcome T'oegye describes as caused by " li 's controlling the activity of ki " . In this respect we can say that the li of the mind-and-heart is what is called rationality . Neo-Confucians refer to the mind-and-heart in which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " .51 2 ) Sensitivity Since ki refers to a thing 's concrete stuff , saying that the mind-andheart is constituted of ki may seem to imply one is thinking of it as a concrete entity . But when one recalls that the mind-and-heart is not considered just a thing of flesh and blood it is clear that there is some misunderstanding here . It is just that insofar as flesh and blood provides the locus whence the functioning of the mind-and-heart arises , ki can represent what is related to this flesh and blood locus , namely the flesh-and-blood linked aspects of consciousness such as sense perception . In fact the phenomenon of consciousness is not a concrete entity , but rather a human power manifested in our actual experience . In terms of the li/ki categories , being experiential and being a functional power are characteristics that belong on the side of ki . They must be explained in terms of ki 's property of belonging to the level of concrete form and possessing activity . This is precisely the sense in which ki is predicated of the mind-and-heart. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; having desires is likewise one of its properties . Therefore all desires are manifested through ki . Thus while T'oegye says that the li of the mind-and-heart is like its nature , he says that ki is a matter of the feelings : " For the mind-and-heart combines li and ki , and governs/unifies the nature and the feelings " ( TGCS. , A , 25.20a ) . Of course feelings have to do with emotion and sentiment , so we can say that ki represents that in the mind-and-heart which manifests its sensitivity . When T'oegye speaks with particular reference to this ki-based aspect of the mind-and-heart he calls it " the human mind . " 3 ) Consciousness as Empty , Spiritual , Undarkened If we consider the exercise of the mind-and-heart 's power of mastery we find it involves both li and ki . Then in the mind-and-heart do li and ki necesarily stand in contrast or opposition to one another ? May it not be the case that a perfect harmonization of these two may not be the essential character of the mind-and-heart ? Earlier we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind-and-heart fills all of space in every direction . " The mind-andheart 's property of spiritual intelligence means not only self-awareness but also the ability to be aware of anything in ' the universe . Thus in a similar sense he says : " Although it is the master over one 's single person , the emptiness and spirituality of its substance is such that it has oversight over all the li of the world " ( TGCS. , B , Onhaengnok , 5.1a ) . The property of being empty and spiritual then , means the mind-and-heart can be aware of all the li of the world . Thus the references to " spiritual intelligence " or qualities of " emptiness and spirituality " serve to establish its scope of awareness . The awareness that we have through this emptiness and spirituality T'oegye terms perception : " Li and ki combine and constitute the mindand-heart , which is , as it were , empty , spiritual , unfathomable . Therefore as soon as things approach it is able to perceive them " ( TGCS. , A , 25. 25b ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence " . " empty and spiritual " , heart in the Ch'eng-Chu school , which understood the Chapter 3 . The Four Seven Debate 93 Tao mind as or " empty , spiritual , and unfathomable " , relate to the power of perception or the power of awareness . And this emptiness , spirituality , and unfathomableness are themselves explained in terms of li and ki . T'oegye uses the phrase , " empty , spiritual , and unfathomable " , and , " empty , spiritual , and undarkened " , interchangeably. ? Being unfathom able or undarkened is actually a manifestation of the consequences of being empty and spiritual . They are the opposite of being without knowledge , without light . It is finally because of the power of emptiness or spirituality that undarkened or unfathomable knowing or " percep tion " comes to pass . Emptiness bespeaks the ability to accumulate knowledge , and spirituality refers to the active ability to fully investigate the li of things and affairs . T'oegye annotates the powers of emptiness and spirituality in terms of li and ki respectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have anything in which to inhere , and if it were not for the mind-and-heart , this li and ki would not have anything in which to inhere . Therefore in man 's mind-and-heart , emptiness ( li ) and spirituality ( ki ) constitute the combination of li and ki . ( TGCS. , B , Ch bnmyong tosol , ch. 5 ) Basically emptiness designates the property of li as being above the level of concrete form while spirituality has to do with activity , which is the property of ki . Of course this is not a matter of speaking of distinctive traits of li and ki as actually separated from each other ; it pertains exclusively to traits revealed by analysis . If it comes to the point where there is reason to fear such analytical distinctions will be taken as evidence for the separateness of li and ki , T'oegye says he would rather eradicate the passage . ' ) But even without such annotation of the properties of emptiness and spirituality , there is another way in which perception is seen as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they are respectively // related to " that which is perceived " and " being able to perceive . " Here T'oegye cites a passage from Chu Hsi : " When li and ki are combined one is able to have perception That which is perceived is li , and being able to perceive is due to the spirituality of ki " ( TGCS. , A , 25. 25b ) . Ultimately it is when these two aspects , li and ki , are in proper mutual harmony that we arrive at true awareness , and the ability to be aware is itself the distinctive property of the mind-and-heart. 3 . Substance/Function in the Mind-and-Heart : The Relationship of the Mind-and-Heart , the Nature , and the Feelings The properties of the mind-and-heart can also be discussed in terms of substance and function , for it is endowed with these two aspects . Function embraces the whole of the mind-and-heart 's functions or operations , while substance in contrast has to do with the condition in which no activity is taking place . Thus the nature manifests substance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " that which combines the nature and the feelings " thus defines it from the point of view of substance and function. $ ) But how does T'oegye think of this substance/function relationship of the nature and the feelings ? According to T'oegye the nature is fundamentally ii in the condition before the actual mind-and-heart with its varied functions is in operation : " That which is li without concrete form and fills the mind-and-heart and is carried in it is the nature " ( TGCS. , A , 36.16a ) . The nature , insofar as it is li , can never operate on its own . It is the feelings that actively manifest the nature : " If one speaks of an active outflow of the nature , then it 's just a matter of the feelings ; how could there be any other active outflow of the nature than the feelings ? " ( TGCS. , B , Chasongnok , I. 23b ) . There is no place for any active outflow of the nature other than the // feelings , for they are precisely that active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases itself on the mind-and-heart to become manifest in issuing as function is the feelings " ( TGCS. , A , 36. 16a ) . The feelings are what manifests the mind-and-heart in a concrete and experiential mode . Thus various feelings are spoken of in terms of particular sorts of mind-and-heart : there is " the mind of commiseration " , " the mind of discerning right and wrong " , etc . We actually recognize the mind-and-heart in its operation as feelings . Therefore saying " the active outflow of the nature is just a matter of the feelings " , amounts to saying li in the mind-and-heart can be found in concrete experience only through the feelings . Experiencing the mind-and-heart as the various feelings , we can infer from them the li of the mind-and-heart . In view of the fact that they are a fundamentally experiential phenomenon , T'oegye says the feelings are constituted of li and ki ( TGCS. , A , 16.30a ) . Thus li is in the feelings as a manifestation of the li of the mind-and-heart , that is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can reason back to li , and if that li can be said to be the potential of what the mind-and-heart may manifest , then one can say that it is the feelings that are the concrete manifestation of li . It is precisely this potentiality and concrete manifestation that constitutes the substance/function relationship between the nature and the feelings . Therefore even though from the point of view of li the content of li as nature and as feelings is the same , the basis for speaking of them is different . Since the nature is the basis of the feelings ( as their potentiality ) and the feelings are the concrete manifestation of the nature , there is a logical cause and effect relationship between them . T'oegye 's way of expressing this relationship is , " the nature issues ( pal , fa ) as the feelings " , or , " the feelings are that which the nature issues ( pal , fa ) " ( TGCS. , A , 7.24a-b ) . We see here that the verb " issue " expresses the substance/function relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentally denotes activating ( paldong , fatong ) or issuing forth ( palch'ul , fa-ch'u ) , which are active modifications . Therefore the expression , " the nature issues as the feelings " , easily gives one the idea that the nature has the power of actively doing something . Moreover , ti // as we earlier observed , the nature and the feelings are respectively like li and ki . Thus one can come to think of " the nature issues as the feelings " , or " the feelings are that which the nature issues " , as meaning " li issues as ki " , or " ki is that which li issues " . But when one says " the nature issues as the feelings " , " issues " can not be taken as an active modification , for as we have seen pal here stands for a logical substance/ function , cause/effect relationship . Even though the verb itself commonly denotes an active modification , it could never be said to represent that from an actual factual ( experiential ) point of view here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferential ) perspective . T'oegye 's saying that " the nature does not act or issue on its own " , is witness of this . Accordingly the idea that there is a power of acting in the nature is a misunderstanding , and equivalent propositions such as " li issues as ki " , or " ki is that which li issues " , which amount to fundamental negations of the distinction betweem li and ki , can not stand . In speaking of the substance and function in terms of the nature and the feelings , the problem rather may be on the side of taking the feelings to represent the function of the mind-and-heart . That is , since feelings are fundamentally a matter of emotions or sentiments , if one takes feelings as representing the function of the mind-and-heart , then there is a question of whether this does not amount to excluding the exercise of thought from the function of the mind-and-heart , or else perhaps that the feelings do not wholly represent its functions . Insofar as the exercise of thought is an operative function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an aspect of the mind-andheart 's function . And it is also beyond doubt that the feelings comprehensively encompass the entirety of the operative functions of the mind-andheart . Therefore it will be necessary to discover in what respect the feelings may be said to signify even the aspect of thinking . Let us consider a concrete example . T'oegye says that the so-called Four Beginnings are feelings . Therefore of the Four Beginnings the one characterized as " the mind of discerning right and wrong " is clearly an example of a feeling . And while this means " a mind that discerns between right and wrong " , at the same time it means " a mind that intends to // discern right from wrong . " The former is an operation of thought , but the latter is an exercise of emotion/appetition . In the light of this we can see that in this usage of the term " feelings " , there is no precise differentiation between the aspect of emotion and the aspect of thought . But in the course of distinguishing between the aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought " , " intention " , and " will " , T'oegye notes the relationship between will , and exercise of thought , and feelings , as follows : That which bases itself on the issuance of the feelings and arbitrates and calculates , determining that it should be this way or that way , is the will . ( TGCS. , A , 29.15a ) First there must be the issuance of the feelings and then there can also be the exercise of thought as to what one should do . If we apply this to the above example we could say that first there must be a mind that intends to discern right from wrong , and then there can be the exercise of thought discerning right from wrong . Ultimately it seems he believes the activation of the feelings provides the occasion for the exercise of thought . Accordingly in point of view of the fact that at the very least all the operative functions of the mind-and-heart arise consequent to the activation of the feelings the feelings are used to represent the function of the mind-and-heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of the feelings , and in particular for his thesis regarding the Four Beginnings and the Seven Feelings . What then are these Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings , and just what was his theory regarding them ? III . The Debate on Interpreting the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings 1 . The Four Beginnings and the Seven Feelings The Four Beginnings refers to four innate dispositions or " minds ( sim , hsin ) " spoken of by Mencius : commiseration , shame and dislike for evil , yielding and deference , and the sense of right and wrong ( Mencius , 2A. // 6 ) . T'oegye follows Chu Hsi 's gloss on " beginning ( tan , tuan ) " as tansb ( tuan-shu ) , literally the end/beginning of a piece of thread , and hence also a " clue " that can be picked up and followed to lead to something . He says , " The Four Beginnings are beginnings ( tan ) in the sense of approaching what is manifest and taking it as a clue ( tansb ) " ( TGCS. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already evident as a clue and find what it is connected to or leads to . Although the end that is the clue is already manifest and known , it is just a part related to something that is not manifest or known . The whole of that something , the real situation , is such as can become manifest through this clue . Ultimately insofar as it has the nature of indicating something , tansO is similar to a sign or a symbol . Here the question of enlarging upon or filling out the tansb comes to the fore . Mencius says : Those who have these Four Beginnings must understand how to enlarge upon them and fulfill them . They are like the start of a fire or the first trickle of a spring : if one can bring them to a fullness they are sufficient to take care of the whole world . ( Mencius , 2A.6 ) What is it , then , that the Four Beginnings manifest or bring out ? It is the four constituents of man 's nature , humanity , righteousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of humanity ; the sense of shame and dislike for evil is the beginning of righteousness ; the sense of yielding and deference is the beginning of propriety ; the sense of right and wrong is the beginning of wisdom . ( Mencius , 2A.6 ) Insofar as commiseration , shame and dislike for evil , yielding and deference , and the sense of right and wrong manifest humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom , they are the clues or leads for each of them . Mencius describes humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom as the constituents of human nature and contrasts them in particular with " the nature that is a matter of food and sex " : As for the mouth 's inclination for flavors , the eye 's for colors , the ear 's for sounds , the nose 's for smells , or the four limbs and their inclination for ease , that belongs to our nature , but there is a norm for such mutters . The // superior person does not call them his nature . ( 7B.24 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature is the humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom that are rooted in his mind-and-heart. ( 7A.21 ) According to Mencius , then , the powers of food and sex related to sight , hearing , taste , and smell are physical and subject to the limitations of matter ( they need a norm ) and hence can not be said to be our nature . What can be said to be our nature is the humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom inherent in our mind-and-heart . Why so ? All men have a mind of commiseration ; all men have a mind that feels shame and dislike for evil ; all men have a mind that feels respect and reverence ; all men have a mind that senses right and wrong . . . . Humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom are not superficial additions to humans , but inherent in them . ( Mencius , 6A.6 ) The reason I say all people have a mind that can not tolerate the suffering of others is this . Say a man sees a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm and commiseration ; it is not that he seeks favor with the child 's parents , or that he wants praise from friends and neighbors , or that he is worried about his reputation . ( Mencius , 2A.6 ) If it is a case of a single dish of rice or bowl of soup , and getting it means life , not getting it means death ; if it is offered in an insulting way even a tramp wo n't take it ; if one steps on it and then offers it , even a beggar will not stoop to take it . ( Mencius , 6A.10 ) In view of this , one who lacks a mind of commiseration is not human , one who lacks a mind that feels shame and dislike for evil is not human , one who lacks a mind of yielding and deference is not human , one who lacks a mind that senses right and wrong is not human . ( Mencius , 2A.6 ) Anyone who is human has the dispositions of humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable us to know that these are in everyone are the manifest phenomena of commiseration , shame and dislike etc. , the Four Beginnings . Therefore Mencius concludes that if there were anyone who did not have the dispositions of humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom he would not he human . In other words , these are the characteristic properties of a human being ; this amounts to saying they constitute // our " original nature . " It is this original or fundamental nature of man that Mencius refers to as " man 's nature . " Therefore we can see that the feelings that manifest this original nature constituted of humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom are the Four Beginnings . Thus in the case of Mencius humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom came to be accepted as human nature in the course of contrasting them with the food and sex kind of nature . It seems then the assumption is that the nature that relates to the appetites for food and sex is assumed to be not good , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteousness , propriety , and wisdom which is contrasted with it is assumed to be good . Because Mencius takes only these as the nature , his thought is characterized by the position that human nature is good . Since humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom constitute a nature that is good , the Four Beginnings that manifest them are likewise thought of as feelings that are good . We will see this corollary developed by T'oegye in his interpretation of the Four Beginnings and the Seven Feelings . The Seven Feelings are a traditional inventory of human feelings that comes originally from a passage in the ninth chapter of the Book of Rites : " What are called man 's feelings ? Joy , anger , sorrow , fear , love , hate , and desire ; with no need to learn them we have these seven innate abilities . " This general summation of the feelings that are powers man has from birth constitutes what are called the " Seven Feelings " . These seven kinds of feelings serve as the generic terms for the feelings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a more exact list of different kinds of human feelings , their content would just be a precision of what is already included in these seven . It follows then that while the Four Beginnings or the appetites for food and sex are partial lists indicating particular kinds of feelings , the Seven Feelings stand comprehensively for the feelings in general . As T'oegye puts it , " As for the Seven Feelings , ? ? ? it is an impartial nondiscriminating terminology that does not lean to either side " ( TGCS. , A , 37.27b ) . So what is meant by the Seven Feelings never " leans to one side " but is " impartial , nondiscriminating . " Of course if one just looks at the terms joy , anger , sorrow , fear , love , hate , and desire , one does not see the names // for the Four Beginnings as such , nor is it clear which would equate with the appetites for food and sex . Here as well one can see that saying the Seven Feelings represent a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope of their meaning , not the precise enumeration . Since the Seven Feelings in this way signify the feelings in general , any list of feelings meant to have a similarly general significance might also be " the Seven Feelings . " In particular , the four feelings listed in the crucial first chapter of the Doctrine of the Mean , joy , anger , sorrow , and pleasure , came to be thought of as also representing the Seven Feelings . And because of this inclusive scope , these feelings can not be character-ized in a one-sided way as either good or evil . 2 . Sparking the Debate : Interpretation of the Feelings T'oegye 's thesis on the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings involves an analysis of these feelings in terms of li and ki . As he expressed it in his revision of the Diagram of the Heavenly Mandate , " the Four Begin-nings are the issuance of li ; the Seven Feelings are the issuance of ki . " This was the formulation that ignited the controversy . His final formula-tion appears in the sixth chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major work : " In the case of the Four Beginnings , li issues and ki follows it ; in the case of the Seven Feelings ki issues and li mounts it . " But how does he arrive at this kind of interpretation ? When we try to understand his interpretation we run into problems , for it never was enunciated in a full form all at once . Rather he arrived at this position in the course of his correspondence on the issue after considera-ble debate and revision . Having begun with the former expression he ends up with the latter at the end of the debate . Thus in order to understand his interpretation one must examine the course of the debate from beginning to end and investigate the changes and shifts in his formula-tions . For this , we must look to the record in the correspondence between T'oegye and Kobong ( Ki Taesung ) . ' ) // T'oegye 's initial formulation , that " the Four Beginnings are the issuance of li , the Seven Feelings the issuance of ki , " was made as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Diagram of the Heavenly Mandate , " The Four Beginnings are issued by li ; the Seven Feelings are issued by ki. " 101 Beginning with Kobong , this revision of T'oegye 's became the object of debate among the scholars of the time . Among them , Kobong in particular sought a clarification from T'oegye . But T'oegye also at first felt less than confident about his formulation . Instead of giving Kobong a precise explanation of his position he on the contrary again modified his interpretation : " The Four Beginnings ' issuance is purely li , and therefore is nothing but good ; the Seven Feelings ' issuance includes ki , and therefore has both good and evil " ( TGCS. , A , 16. lb ) . Kobong was critical of this formulation as well : the initial expression was certainly mistaken , and while this one might be a slight improvement , it still seemed inappropriate . His main reason for this negative view was his feeling that T'oegye seemed to be making the Four Beginnings something apart from the Seven Feelings : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are yet also the Four Beginnings ? " ( TGCS. , A , 16.13a ) . According to Kobong the distinction between the Four Beginnings and the Seven Feelings is entirely a matter of in what respect one is speaking of the feelings . That is , it depends on whether one is speaking of the feelings comprehensively or selectively . It is nothing more than a matter of the Seven Feelings referring to the feelings in general or " speaking of them in their entirety " , while the Four Beginnings refer to a particular // portion that " has been singled out . " And if this is the case , then the Four Beginnings ar , e nothing more than a selective reference to those among the all-inclusive Seven Feelings that , in the words used by the Doctrine of the Mean to describe perfection , " issue and are perfectly measured " ; that is , they are perfectly in accord with the conditions of the situation ( TGCS. , A , 16.14a ) . Since the Four Beginnings can not be put outside the scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings as fundamentally different . And , according to Kobong , if one looks at it in terms of the relationship of li and ki the result is the same . Certainly li is the master of ki and ki provides the concrete material for li , and in this respect one can say they are diverse ; but on the level of concrete things they are inseparably combined ( TGCS. , A , 16.13b ) . Any discussion of li and ki with reference to the feelings is a discussion on the level of concrete things , and hence he can not accept T'oegye 's interpretation . Kobong further observes that an analysis of the matter in terms of good and evil yields a similar conclusion . " Those which are good are a matter of the original perfection of the Heavenly Mandate , while those that are evil are a matter of excess or deficiency due to ki " ( TGCS. , A , 16.14a ) . What is good bespeaks the original perfection of li ( the Heavenly Mandate ) , the original substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ki . But since li does not exist separately from ki , the original perfection of li 's substance is naturally manifested only when it functions with no excess or deficiency on the part of ki . Therefore the Four Beginnings are looked upon as good not because they are pure li , but because they are cases where the feelings function with no imperfections being introduced by ki . In this respect the fact that the Seven Feelings have both good and evil may be said to be due to the fact that li is non-active ( " weak " ) while ki is active ( " strong " ) and at times the activity of ki involves excess or deficiency . The Four Beginnings , then , are nothing but a matter of singling out the " perfectly moderated " cases among the Seven Feelings ; from the start there is no implication that the Four and the Seven refer to anything fundamentally different : " What are called the four Beginnings and the Seven Feelings has never meant two // different things " ( TGCS. , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first formulation and can not accept the amended version either . It is not permissible , he says " to contrast the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings to one another as pure li ' versus including ki ' ( TGCS. , A , 16.13b ) . 3 . T'oegye 's First Letter in Response It happened at that point that T'oegye discovered in the record of Chu Hsi 's conversations a passage that was almost exactly the same as his own first formulation : " The Four Beginnings are the issuance of 1i ; the Seven Feelings are the issuance of ki " ( YL. , 53.17b ) . This gave him confidence that his initial interpretation was correct . Not only was his first formulation right , but even Chong Chiun 's original expression would do , he asserts ( TGCS. , A , 16.12a ) . In keeping with this T'oegye presented the case for the appropriateness of his interpretation . It goes without saying , he says , that the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings are all equally feelings . But the terminology for them is different and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so chi i On cha , so chih erh yen che ) " is different . This amounts , in T'oegye 's view , to the same thing Kobong was getting at when he said the difference was a matter of " that with respect to which ( so ch'u i ? 5n cha , so chiu erh yen che ) " one was speaking of the feelings ( TGCS. , A , 16. 8b ) . The Four Beginnings are " all good " , but the Seven Feelings " can be good " , that is , " good and evil are not yet determined " ( TGCS. , A , 16. l0a ) . Therefore the Four and the Seven must be distinguished . In accord with this , T'oegye notes that since Kobong says that " that with respect to which they are spoken of is not the same " and that the Four Beginnings are " singled out " , he is contradicting himself when he concludes " the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings do not have different referents " ( TGCS. , A , 16.11b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ki in this context . T'oegye says : There certainly has never been ki without /i , and likewise there has never been li without ki . ( TGCSS. , A , I6.8h ) // Nevertheless since that with respect to which one speaks is not the same , then likewise it is necessary that there be a distinction . ( TGCS. , A , 16.9a ) There can be neither li nor ki in the absence of the other , but if " that with respect to which one speaks is not the same " , then there must be a distinction . Since li and ki mean something different from one another , it seems the difference between the Four and Seven can be interpreted in terms of li and ki . Not only that , according to T'oegye in the case of each of these two kinds of feeling , their " source of origination ( so chongnae , so tsung-lai ) " is different . This becomes one of the cornerstones of his position . In the case of one set of feelings , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety , and wisdom " , while in the case of the other , " external things stimulate one 's form and there is a movement within ; thus circumstanced they emerge " ( TGCS. , A , 16.9b ) . So the Four Beginnings issue from the nature , while the Seven Feelings are produced by the circumstances when something external provides a stimulus and there is a responsive movement within the mind-and-heart . That they refer to something different or are spoken of with respect to something different is in fact based upon this difference in their source of origination . That is , because the Four Beginnings are the clues or outward indicators of the humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom of the nature within the mind-and-heart , even though they are comprised of a combination of li and ki , what they refer to is mainly the li aspect . The Seven Feelings have to do mainly with ki , our physical constitution , the aspect that is most easily subject to external stimulus ; as the products of such stimuli , though they likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they refer to is mainly the ki aspect . T'oegye even adds , " How could you have ... something stimulated externally which is thus a matter of one 's physical constitution , and at the same time its issuance be the original perfection of the substance of ii ? " ( TGCS. , A , 16.10a ) . This kind of distinction between the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings parallels the common distinction between the original nature and the physical nature : " The differentiation of the Four and Seven in the case of the feelings is like the difference between the original nature and // the psychophysical endowment in the case of the nature " ( TGCS. , A , 16. 9b ) . The Four Beginnings ' being considered with no reference to their existence in combination with ki is just like the original nature 's being considered with no reference to its relationship with a concrete physical ( ki ) constitution , and the Seven Feelings ' referring entirely to ki is like the physical nature with its reference to the physical constitution . T'oegye gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " nature comprised of appetites for food and sex " , i.e. the nature related to the senses , and states that " it is a particular reference that only speaks of the ki aspect " ( TGCS. , A , 16.11a ) . Thus he is able to counter Kobong 's objections with his own question : If in the case of the nature it is legitimate to speak in this way with exclusive reference to just li or just ki , then why should such an approach be excluded in the case of the feelings ? ( TGCS. , A , 16.9b ) T'oegye sums his argument up : In the light of this , in the case of the two sets of feelings , though one can say neither falls outside the combination of li and ki , on the basis of their source of origination each is spoken of with reference to a predominant factor ( so chu ) aspect and has a particular emphasis . In that case , if one characterizes the one as a matter of li and the other as a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TGCS. , A , 16.10a-b ) According to T'oegye Kobong 's position is inclined towards sameness and dislikes differentiation ; he criticizes Kobong for an excessive fondness for synthesis and disinclination for analytic distinctions . This orientation in one 's pursuit of learning , he says , can easily devolve into treating the nature ( li ) as a matter of ki , or conversely confusing human passions ( ki ) with the normative Heavenly li . He concludes his attack by observing that Kobong 's statement that " ki 's natural manifestation is the original substance of li " , amounts to seeing li and ki as a single thing and not distinguishing them ( TGCS. , A , 16.11b-12a ) . " ) // 4 . Points of Disagreement Regarding T'oegye 's First Response According to Kobong , although the feelings may be differentiated into the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings in terms of differences in that to which they refer , the differentiation is not like that made by T'oegye . Although the Four Beginnings are similar to what T'oegye says insofar as " Mencius took the wondrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out those which are issued by li and so nothing but good " ( WBS. , A , 9a ) , the Seven Feelings are a different matter . Since the Seven Feelings are a combination of li and ki , they involve both good and evil : Tzu Ssu in the Doctrine of the Mean took the wondrous combination of li and ki in the feelings and spoke of them as comprised of both ; thus the feelings definitely include both li and ki and have both good and evil . ( WBS. , A , 9a ) Thus he asserts that the Seven Feelings were never meant to signify only the ki aspect . " Human feelings are ultimately of just one kind , and that which comprises them is definitely a combination of li and ki " ( WBS. , A , 9b ) . As for the Four Beginnings , " Are they not those among the Seven Feelings that are the normative li aspect , and hence good ? " ( WBS. , A , l5b ) . Therefore in considering the question of the Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with respect to which they are spoken of ' , he says , " The Four Beginnings and the Seven Feelings have never meant two things .... If one follows them back to their roots or wellspring , I believe there is not a twofold meaning involved " ( WBS. , A , 19a ) , and again , " There is no other separate kind of feelings " ( WBS. , A , 16a ) . T'oegye had introduced the case of the distinction between the original nature and the physical nature as a parallel for his distinction , but Kobong observes that the physical nature refers to both li and ki , not just to ki . Chu Hsi originally said , " In discussing the nature of Heaven and Earth i.e. nature as norm ) , then one exclusively refers to 1i ; if one discusses the physical nature , then one refers to li as admixed with ki " // ( WBS. , A , 8b ) . Thus Kobong criticizes T'oegye 's " speaking of the Seven Feelings and the physical nature in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . T'oegye 's idea was that one could interpret the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings in terms of a distinction between li and ki following from the difference of that with respect to which one speaks in using these different terms , but according to Kobong this is not so . There is , he says , no problem about making such a distinction speaking on the level of Heaven and Earth or humans and other creatures , but such is not the case when it comes to speaking of the nature and the feelings . The reason is that the physical nature is explicitly a matter of li already within ki , and the feelings are something that issue only after the original nature is within ki , that is , they involve the combination of li and ki ( WBS. , A , 13b ) .12 ) More than anything Kobong centered his attention on the fact that T'oegye takes differentiating the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings in terms of " the difference of that with respect to which they are spoken of " as being due to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect he notes that while they both make use of the phrase , " the difference of that with respect to which they are spoken of- , what they mean by it is something quite different ( WBS. , A , 12a ) . In line with this he looks into the issue of the feelings ' source of origination . T'oegye 's thesis regarding the Seven Feelings was that " external things stimulate one 's form and there is a movement within ; thus circumstanced they emerge " ( TGCS. , A , 16.9b ) . Kobong notes that this originally comes from an essay by Ch'eng Yi , where it read , " external things stimulate one 's form and there is a movement within . There is the movement within and the Seven Feelings emerge . ' " Therefore though the emergence of the feelings may seem to be due to circumstances , according to Ch'eng 's original text it is due to something " within " ( WBS. , A , 16a ) . T'oegye also says the Seven Feelings are the product of the stimulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily stimulated and the first to be moved at the approach of external things is physical form , and the Seven Feelings are its products " ( TGCS. , A , 16.10a ) . But since li also is fundamental in the mind-and-heart it is at one with what is aroused by external things and moved ; in no way is it a matter of the mind-and-heart without li being stimulated by the encounter with external things . Therefore , Kobong says , T'oegye 's explanation of the Seven Feelings in terms of the stimulus of physical form is insufficient ( WBS. , A , 16a ) . Moreover , if it is a matter of being stimulated by external things , then the case of the Four Beginnings is not different . Mencius ' famous example of the issuance of the feeling of commiseration is evidence of this : one must see the baby about to fall into the well , and then there is the feeling of commiseration that happens as a response in accord with the li of humanity which is within the mind-and-heart ( WBS. , A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw a distinction between the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings in terms of their source of origination . If on the basis of the thesis that fundamentally the nature is the not yet aroused feelings and the feelings are the actively aroused nature one can say that " the Four Beginnings issue from the nature constituted of humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom " , then " the Seven Feelings likewise issue from the nature constituted of humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom " ( WBS. , A , 15b ) . Kobong objects that if T'oegye says the Seven Feelings are purely a matter of the physical form being stimulated by external things and so not the original substance of li , that amounts to saying they are not related to the nature . Then what Tzu Ssu said about them in the Doctrine of the Mean when he talked about instances that were " perfectly moderated " and so " harmonious " , must be mistaken ( WBS. , A , 17a ) . But how , Kobong asks , could one say the Seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure , of the sages and worthies such as Confucius and Mencius , were not the original substance of li ? Kobong also suggests a different view of the distinctive character of the Seven Feelings , expressed by T'oegye as " good and evil are not yet determined . " Master Ch'eng had said , " As for joy , anger , sorrow and // pleasure , before they are aroused when are they ever not good ? And when they issue and are perfectly moderated , then there is no respect in which they are not good . " In the light of this , not only the Four Beginnings , but the Seven Feelings as well are all good . It 's only when their issuance is " not perfectly moderated " that they are evil . Hence it seems dubious to characterize them as " good and evil not yet determined " ( WBS. , A , 17b ) . Any feeling , whatever it be , bespeaks the already aroused , active condition of the mind-and-heart . As aroused and active , it is a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect Kobong asserts that the Four Beginnings are likewise a matter of ki ( WBS. , A , 16b ) . And moreover , insofar as ki is necessarily involved there are also cases in which the Four Beginnings are not perfectly moderated , and so one can not say they are all good . For example , there are cases when ordinary people feel shame when they should n't feel shame , cases when they sense right or wrong about something inappropriately etc . ( WBS. , A , 25b ) . But even while he thus maintains that the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings are not basically different things , at the same time he accepts the statement that in the case of the Four Beginnings " they just come from li and do not include ki " , for that was Mencius ' point when he spoke of them ( WBS. , A , 25b ) . According to Kobong , Mencius ' original intention in speaking of the phenomenon of the Four Beginnings was to show us our inborn originally perfect nature , that is , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A , 9b ) . Mencius himself originally used the Four Beginnings only in the sense of the good original nature . Therefore because he feels it is in accord with Mencius ' original intention Kobong is willing to accept T'oegye 's interpretation , but only in the case of the Four Beginnings . The original substance of li is completely a matter of feelings " that issue and are perfectly moderated " , that is , that are " the natural manifestation of ki " ( WBS. , A , 20b ) . Although T'oegye attacked this thesis as " confusing li and ki as the same thing and not distinguishing between them " , Kobong says it must be accepted . The reason is as follows . Fundamentally li , if it were not for ki , would have nothing in which to inhere . Further , since li itself is not directly perceptible , it is known only // through our experience of concrete things , and the phenomenal image which is our experience of the concrete thing is arrived at through the activity of ki ( WBS. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ki takes place " with no excess or deficiency " but in a fully natural way , such as the case of feelings " issuing perfectly moderated " , then this can not but be the original substance of li . And insofar as the Mencian Four Beginnings T'oegye speaks of amount to those of the Seven Feelings that issue and are perfectly moderated , it seems perfectly clear that fundamentally they are noting but " the same reality with a different name " ( WBS. , A , 9b &; 18b ) . In the light of this review it seems that T'oegye 's interpretation of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings makes them into two originally different kinds of feelings . If that is not the case , says Kobong , then it appears that the feelings have two different kinds of goodness , one for the issuance of li and one for the issuance of ki ( WBS. , A , 10b ) . In terms of the overall theory , though T'oegye 's interpretation might not hurt any-thing , when it comes to incorporating it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandate , the necessities of the diagrammatic format make the distinctions too stark and thus liable to lead to misunderstandings ( WBS. , A , 10b ) . 5 . T'oegye 's Second Response T'oegye countered , " If it 's alright it 's all alright , if it 's not alright it 's all not alright . How can you say the overall theory does not harm anything but in diagrammatic form it is not permissible ! " ( TGCS. , A , 34b ) . He asserts that though he put it in the diagram he saw to it that the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings were enclosed in a single circle , 14t and after this simple symbolization wrote a single annotation at the side , so if anything is wrong it is hard to see how it can be just the diagram ? But T'oegye , prompted by the points of difference with Kobong , reviewed his position and recognized a number of mistakes and corrected // them . First , he accepted Kobong 's explanation/defense of what he meant by saying ki 's natural issuance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's argument that neither the Seven Feelings nor the physical nature were matters of exclusive reference to just ki . Not only that , but he also changed his statement that in the Seven Feelings " good and evil are not yet determined " , amending it to say , " They are originally good but easily devolve into evil . " And he also agreed with the assertion that though the emergence of the feelings seems to be due to circumstances actually they emerge due to something within us . As for the rest of his position on the Four-Seven question , his only modification was to eliminate " particular emphasis ( so chung , so ch'ung ) " from his statement , " Based on their source of origination each of these groups of feelings is spoken of with reference to the predominant factor or particular emphasis . " On the other points T'oegye saw no need to correct his position . On these remaining points he steadfastly maintained his position and carefully argued them against Kobong 's contrary view . According to T'oegye , if one contrasts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seven Feelings are to ki as the Four Beginnings are to li " ( TGCS. , A , 16.32b ) . It is certain that each has a different meaning in terms of the distinction of li and ki : " If one contrasts the two and pursues the matter to their roots and wellspring , there is in fact the distinction between li and ki . How can you say there is no difference of meaning involved at that level ? " ( TGCS. , A , 16.33b ) . In another explanation bearing on this point he says : If one approaches them as the same but understands in the sameness how they also differ , then he will see that that with respect to which the two are spoken of , fundamentally of itself involves the dissimilarity of li being the predominant factor in the one and ki in the other , different categories . ( TGCS. , A , 16.29b ) Although the Four Beginnings and the Seven Feelings are the same insofar as both involve a combination of li and ki , one must also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " difference of meaning " , or the " difference of that with respect to which they are spoken of . " And that difference of reference can not but find // expression in terms of " li being the predominant factor in the one and ki in the other , different categories " . The Four Beginnings must also mount ki in order to issue , or as Kobong puts it , " the Four Beginnings are likewise a matter of ki " ; but as he himself notes , that is not in keeping with Mencius ' original point . T'oegye stresses that what Mencius was pointing out was by no means the aspect that goes with the mounting of ki , but rather the aspect in which they are the issuance of li in its perfection : Mencius ' intention was only to indicate and explain how they issue in a pure way from humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom , in order to show that the nature is originally good , therefore the feelings likewise are good , that is all . ( TGCS. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Four Beginnings issuing from the humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom that constitute the nature had as its purpose showing the original goodness of the nature it was likewise his intention to show feelings that are good . Therefore one can say the Four Beginnings are good . If one sees what he meant to be referring to , the statements that " the Four Beginnings likewise are a matter of ki " , or , " the Four Beginnings likewise involve cases that are not perfectly moderated " become impossible ; one must admit that " the Four Beginnings are the issuance of principle ( TGCS. , A , 16.32a-b ) . On the other hand , what about the Seven Feelings ? First let us say with Kobong that those that issue and are perfectly moderated are " the original substance of li . " Especially in the case of outstanding persons such as Mencius the issuance of the Seven Feelings will be perfectly moderated , that is ki will issue them in compliance with li , and there being no obstruction they will perfectly maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But that is not the condition of the Seven Feelings in the case of ordinary people : in their case at times these feelings may be perfectly moderated , but at others they are certainly imperfect . Insofar as the character of ki 's active role is indeterminate the perfection of the original substance of li can not be integrally preserved . The fact that the original substance can not be integrally preserved can be seen in this analysis to he entirely a matter of the properties of ki . So in // line with this it is only proper to describe the Seven Feelings as " the issuance of ki . " And , T'oegye adds , if this is the sense in which one says they are the issuance of ki , Kobong need not trouble himself that such a description leaves physical form , the nature , and the feelings as somehow unrelated with each other ( TGCS. , A , 16.36b ) . Earlier Kobong had used Chu Hsi 's theory of the nature to argue against this kind of li/ki analysis of the Four Beginnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that since the normative nature of Heaven and Earth ( i.e. the universe ) points to li , it is acceptable to interpret the Four Beginnings in terms of li alone , but insofar as the physical nature is explicitly the combination of li and ki it is not acceptable to say that the Seven Feelings can be interpreted in terms of ki alone . But T'oegye had countered that even though it is agreed that the nature of Heaven and Earth is an expression that indicates only li , can it really be said that there is only li and that ki is entirely absent ? According to T'oegye in this case as well although there is ki only li is spoken of . And since one can do this with the normative nature of Heaven and Earth , in the case of the physical nature as well one can from the composite of li and ki speak only of ki . This is not a matter of simply disregarding one aspect of the composite ; rather it involves attending to what is being considered as the predominant factor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29b-30a ) . Kobong had said there is no harm in distinguishing li and ki on the level of Heaven and Earth or man and other creatures , but one can not do it on the level of the nature or the feelings . But on the level of Heaven and Earth or man and other creatures it is likewise not the case that li and ki are in any way actually separate from one another . And in spite of the fact that they are thus inseparable nonetheless one may draw distinctions between them . Since there is such a precedent for drawing distinctions in cases where li and ki are admittedly inseparable , when it comes to the nature and the feelings , even though they involve both li and ki there are no grounds for specially excluding them and saying one can not draw that kind of distinction ( TGCS. , A , 16. 30b ) . Ultimately then , an interpretation that categorically distinguishes them in terms of the " issuance of li " // and the " issuance of ki " is possible . T'oegye sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is actually a difference between the issuance of li and the issuance of ki , and on this basis gives them different names , that is all . If fundamentally there were no difference , how could one give them different names ? Therefore although one can not say that outside the Seven Feelings there are also the Four Beginnings , if one immediately draws the conclusion that they thus do not mean anything different , that I fear would be wrong . ( TGCS. , A , 16.34a ) Even though the Four Beginnings are not outside the Seven Feelings , they manifest different content as the issuance of li and the issuance of ki , and this gives rise to the terminological difference . Therefore T'oegye can not agree that the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings are " the same reality with two different names ( TGCS. , A , 16. 34a ) . All the aspects of Kobong 's critique along that line ? that " feelings " does not signify two different kinds of things , that T'oegye 's interpretation is dubious because it implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feelings , that the Seven Feelings likewise issue from humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom , that according to Chu Hsi the nature can not be spoken of apart from ki , etc. ? all this is nothing more than concentrating only on the similarities and not looking at the way these feelings are also different from each other ( TGCS. , A , 16.29b - 35b ) . Next T'oegye argues the case for differentiating the feelings in terms of their source of origination : Their issuance each has its characteristic pattern ( hySl maek ) , their names each refer to something in particular . ( TGCS. , A , 16.32a ) Although both alike are feelings , they are not without a difference in their source of origination and so from of old the way they were spoken of has not been the same . If there were no difference in their source of origination , then what basis would there be for speaking of them differently ? ( TGCS. , A , 16.35a ) In T'oegye 's view the source of origination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , is indeed different . And there has been no change in his idea that their difference of meaning is // due to this difference in whence they come . But when it comes to his explanation of this difference in their source of origination T'oegye to a certain extent yielded to Kobong 's opposition and amended his thesis : Even I do not mean to say the Seven Feelings do not have anything to do with li and are merely fortuitously stimulated by external things and moved in response . And with respect to being stimulated by something and then activated , the Four Beginnings certainly are no different than the Seven Feelings . But in the case of the Four Beginnings li gives issue and ki follows it , while in the case of the Seven Feelings ki gives issue and li mounts it , that 's all . ( TGCS. , A , 16.32a ) So the Seven Feelings are not activated unrelated to li and the Four Beginnings are moved according to the stimulus of external things . That is , the feelings can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature and another set that is moved according to external stimulus . On this point T'oegye has come to agree with Kobong . But he goes on to say that the Four Beginnings are a case of ki following upon the issuance of li , while the Seven Feelings are a case of li mounting upon the issuance of ki . This is precisely his formulation of the difference in whence they come . T'oegye continues with a further explanation of this : In sum , since there are cases when li gives issue and ki follows it , one can speak of them as having li as their predominant factor , which does not mean the li is outside of ki : such are the Four Beginnings . Since there are cases when ki gives issue and li mounts on it , one can speak of them as having ki as their predominant factor , which does not mean the ki is apart from li : such are the Seven Feelings . ( TGCS. , A , 16.36a-b ) Saying that li gives issue and ki follows it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing involved and does not imply that li is separate , and the same is true of ki in the expression , " ki gives issue and li mounts it " . T'oegye further explains this exposition by appealing to the simile of the horse and rider , a figure earlier Neo-Confucians , including Chu Hsi , sometimes used in discussing the li-ki relationship : For the rider does not come or go without the horse , and the horse without the rider gets off the right path . Thus the rider and horse are interdependent and inseparable . And as for the way people talk about this , some refer // in general terms to journeying , which includes both rider and horse ; this is like speaking of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings in an undifferentiated way . Others may refer to the rider 's journeying , in which case there is no need to explicitly refer to the horse , but the traveling of the horse is likewise included ; this is like the Four Beginnings . Yet others may refer to the horse going , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider , but his going is likewise included ; this is like the Seven Feelings . ( TGCS. , A , 16.32b-33a ) . So a general reference to journeying is like speaking in general of the feelings without any differentiation , while explicit references to the rider or the horse are like speaking of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings : they refer in each case explicitly to li or ki , but in both cases the presence of the counterpart is also implied . Here T'oegye gives us the comprehensive basis for saying that an interpretation differentiating between the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings in terms of the issuance of li and ki respectively is possible : For in the case of the human individual , li and ki combine and he is born . Therefore both of them mutually have the function of issuing and moreover in the issuing they are interdependent . Since they mutually issue one can understand that each has its predominant factor , and since they are interdependent one can understand that both are always involved . Both are always involved , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an undifferentiated way . Each has its predominant factor , and therefore one may differentiate in speaking of them and there is nothing impermissible in that . ( TGCS. , A , 16.30b ) Li and ki both have their aspect of functionally giving issuance , that is " they mutually have the function of issuing . " Then they are related interdependently . The " mutual issuance " means each can have its own predominant factor , while interdependence tells us they are always together no matter which is specified . Since they are always together they can be spoken of holistically with no differentiation , but having a predominant factor they may also be spoken of differentiated by reference to that factor . 11 8 CRITICAL ISSUES IN NEO-CONFUCIAN THOUGHT 6 . Differences Regarding the Second Letter Kobong explicates his criticism of T'oegye 's interpretation when it comes to a diagrammatic presentation of his thesis as follows : My saying there is no harm in your thesis in an overall discussion of the topic is based on its being a consecutive exposition ( in sal , in shuo ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to putting it in an diagram is based on its becoming a contrastive exposition ( tae sbl , tuei shuo ) in that form . ( WBS. , B , 11a ) Kobong elsewhere explains the " contrastive exposition " as referring to their placement side by side in a way that puts the two in contrast . The " consecutive exposition " has a top to bottom linear or sequential treatment in which one element becomes the basis for the next ( WBS. , B , 8b ) . Chu Hsi 's statement that " the Four Beginnings are the issuance of li , the Seven Feelings are the issuance of ki " , is also consecutive exposition rather than contrastive , according to Kobong ( WBS. , B , 8a ) .151 It goes without saying then , that if T'oegye 's interpretation were a contrastive exposition it would be inadmissible . Even Chu Hsi 's statement would have to be judged as wrong if it were made in a contrastive sense ( WBS. , B , llb ) . Kobong 's basic understanding of the Four Beginnings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the Four Beginnings are the issuance of li , but one may not say the Seven Feelings are the issuance of ki , for the Seven Feelings are the feelings that combine li and ki and are spoken of in an undifferentiated way . ( WBS. , B , 6b ) When he speaks like T'oegye of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings as the issuance of li and ki respectively , what he means is just that the Four Beginnings belong to just one aspect of the Seven Feelings , // that of ii , while both good and evil do not come out until the ki aspect is taken into account . This is especially his perspective in commenting on the diagrammatic form . When it comes to T'oegye 's explanation of the source of origination of the issuance of the Four Beginnings and the Seven Feelings Kobong likewise can not accept it as it is . For even while it accepts the similarity in the Four Beginnings ' and Seven Feelings ' both issuing at the stimulus of external things , T'oegye 's revised draft still singles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for being easily stimulated and the first to move at the approach of external things , there is nothing like physical form " , and , " what is stimulated externally is a matter of physical form " ( WBS. , B , 4a ) . And although T'oegye would not concede Kobong 's statement that the Four Beginnings likewise were at times not perfectly moderated , as Kobong now confesses , it was not originally just his own proposition : it is already to be found in the record of Chu Hsi ' s conversations ( Chu-tzu Yu-lei ) . Seeing that it comes out in the Yu-lei , Kobong observes , one can see that it takes Mencius ' explanation as a foundation for clarifying points that Mencius left incomplete ( WBS. , B , 16b ) . However that may be , that the Four Beginnings can be imperfectly moderated is just like the bright moonlight that shines on rough water but is not in itself affected by the waves ( WBS. , B , 8a ) . T'oegye emphasizes that the Four Beginnings are good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goodness any different from what the Doctrine of the Mean describes as the perfection of the Seven Feelings when they " issue and are perfectly moderated " . And , he asks , would the expression , " issue and are perfectly moderated " , belong on the side of " issued by li " or on the side of " issued by ki " ( WBS. , B , 9a-b ) . Of course for Kobong , if it is a case of " ki 's being in compliance with li and issuing without the least bit of obstruction " , then it amounts to " the issuance of li " ( WBS. , B , 10b ) . In a word , though in point of their goodness T'oegye may describe the Four Beginnings as " the issuance of li " or " issued by li " , what characterizes goodness is nothing more than " issuing perfectly moderated . " Accordingly , if one looks at it from this point of view , Kohong feels , then his position must certainly he correct , // and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed be " the same reality with two different names " . The " same reality with different names " position is applicable to the case of the nature as well : the " original nature " and the " physical nature " both are the nature , just like the moon in the heavens and the moon reflected on the water are both the moon ( WBS. , B , 7b ) . In terms of his thesis of their mutually having the function of issuing T'oegye may assert the possibility of li and ki each predominating and giving rise to distinct categories , but Kobong notes that this position invites problems . If one says that they mutually have the function of issuing then it seems that li likewise has activity . Such a thesis , he observes , makes li and ki like two men occupying a single mind-andheart and taking turns activating motion forwards or backwards ( WBS. , B , 22a ) . In sum , Kobong is still dissatisfied with the revised formulation that " in the case of the Four Beginnings li issues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven Feelings ki issues and li mounts it " , for he thinks that it is basically a matter of the Seven Feelings combining both li and ki while the Four Beginnings manifest only the li aspect . Thus he suggests that it might be better to say , " As for the issuance of the feelings , in some cases li moves them and ki is there , in some cases ki arouses them and li mounts it " ( WBS. , B , 10b ) . He even sent T'oegye a copy of the diagram amended in this fashion . 7 . T'oegye 's Third Response and Kobong 's Summary and Postscript T'oegye briefly replied to some of Kobong 's points.16 ) Those of the Seven Feelings that are good ( that issue and are perfectly moderated ) , // " although they are issued by ki , insofar as li mounts it and predominates , their goodness is therefore the same as the goodness of the Four Beginnings " ( TGCS. , A , 17.5b ) . But that having been said , it does not mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of the predominance of li or ki respectively has disappeared . As has already been said , when one addresses the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings in an undifferentiated manner such an analysis is impossible , but it is possible to contrast and thus distinguish them as well ( TGCS. , A , 17.3b ) . Kobong had introduced the image of the moon shining on various sorts of water , and T'oegye now uses it to explain his differentiation of these feelings . The moon shining in the heavens and the moon reflected in the water may be both the same moon , but the one in the heavens is the real one while the one on the water is a reflection . In one respect they are both the same , but in another respect they are different . This comparison of Kobong 's may approximate the case of the nature , but it does not work for the feelings . The reason is that the clarity or lack thereof of the reflection in the water depends not only on the condition of the moon in the heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( TGCS. , A , 17. 4b-5a ) . Accordingly such a situation could never be described as just " the same reality with different names . T'oegye explores the image in a different vein to illustrate the distinction between the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings : When the reflection of the moon appears in clear water with a calm current , one may refer to the moon and speak of its moving , and the movement of the water is implied in that . If the water is roughened by the wind and broken up by rocks the moon may be so distorted that it disappears . Here one should just refer to the water and speak of its movement , and the clarity or lack thereof of the reflection is just an extension of the degree of movement of the water . ( TGCS. , A , 17.5a ) T'oegye thus concludes by once more refusing Kobong 's assertion that when ki issues in compliance with li it amounts to what is meant by the issuance of li : " If one takes the case of ki issuing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts to the mistake of taking ki for li " // ( TGCS. , A , 17.6b ) . In the end T'oegye does not make any further corrections to his second draft . At this , Kobong , realizing T'oegye was calling an end to further argumentation , composed his Postscript to the Four-Seven Debate ( Sa tan chil thong husol ) and General Summary of the Four-Seven Debate ( Sa tan chil chong ch'ongnon ) " in which he presented an account of the results they had thus far reached . He notes that on some points both his view and T'oegye 's view are both appropriate ; thus while he continues asserting his own position he at the same time recognizes the validity of T'oegye 's . In persisting in his own position , more than anything Kobong 's foundation was the thesis of the identity between " ki issuing in compli ance with li " and " the issuance of li " , a thesis which T'oegye had denied . While recognizing T'oegye 's description of the perfect issuance of the Seven Feelings in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " ki issuing in compliance with li without the least bit of obstruction " , Kobong is unwilling to say that the source of origination of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings is different , which would make it appropriate to describe the issuance of the Seven Feelings as the issuance of ki . For , he says , when the Seven Feelings " issue and are perfectly moderated " , that is a matter ( as described in the first chapter of the Doctrine of the Mean ) of the nature as the normative Heavenly Mandate , the original substance of li ; in this respect there is no difference between the Seven Feelings and the Four Beginnings and they can not be described as the issuance of ki . That which issues as perfectly moderated is described in the Doctrine of the Mean as " harmony " and that in turn is called the " universal path " . If one says " cases of the issuance of ki in compliance with li " , that is , cases where the issuance is perfectly moderat ed , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " universal path " of the world is a matter of the issuance of ki ! The issuance of li is completely a matter of ki 's issuing in compliance with li and nothing more . Therefore there is no mistaking the fact that cases where the Seven // Feelings issue and are perfectly moderated and the Four Beginnings are " the same reality with different names " ( TGCS. , A , 17.26b-27a ) . In that case Mencius ' Four Beginnings , as has been said , are a matter of approaching the feelings which are composed of li and ki and include both good and evil , and selectively referring to the good side , described as " issuing from li and being nothing but good " . Mencius spoke thus in terms of the Four Beginnings in order to clarify the rationale for saying man 's nature is good , and in the light of this intention one can understand the description of the Four Beginnings as the issuance of li and perfectly good ( TGCS. , A , 17.28b-29a ) . Insofar as it is congruent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kobong finds T'oegye 's description of the Four Beginnings acceptable . On the other hand , since the Seven Feelings combine li and ki and include both good and evil , althought their issuance is not a matter of ki alone , it does involve the physical constitution . Thus they are described as " the issuance of ki " , and this leads to saying the Seven Feelings are like the physical nature . Moreover although the Seven Feelings combine li and ki , " li is weak , ki is forceful " , so it is easy for them to end up becoming evil when li proves unable to control ki . Because of this as well they are described as the issuance of ki ( TGCS. , A , 17.29a ) . So with respect to the point that " the Seven Feelings easily devolve into evil " Kobong likewise accepts T'oegye 's interpretation of the Seven Feelings in terms of the issuance of ki . T'oegye was satisfied with the contents of Kobong 's Postscript and General Summary . He says it is a fine example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beginning ending with a luxuriant flourishing and unified outcome " ( TGCS. , A , 17.24a ) . At the same time he now accepts positions of Kobong 's that he had up to this point opposed . He now seems willing to concede that cases in which " ki issues in compliance with li " are " the issuance of li " , and thus that the Four Beginnings and the Seven Feelings are not fundamentally different , there being no difference in their source of origination ( TGCS. , A , 17. 24h ) . He admits , " In the discussion of my position , what I said about joy , anger , sorrow and pleasure ! i.e. the Seven Feelings ! in the case of sages // and worthies , and what I said about the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings each having a distinctive source of origination etc. , in the end seems to be problematic " ( TGCS. , A , 17. 23a-b ) . With this it seems the debate between the two is over . Ending the debate with Kobong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he arrived at in the argument of his second letter to Kobong : rather than " the Four Beginnings are the issuance of li , while the Seven Feelings are the issuance of ki " , his formulation in the first draft ; it was to be , " in the case of the Four Beginnings li gives issue and ki follows it ; in the Seven Feelings ki gives issue and li mounts it " . t81 This " revised interpretation " , as it is known , remained his final interpre tation for the rest of his life . It seems that he believed Kobong 's final concession to have been conceding precisely this revised interpretation . It remains to be seen , however , whether it was this interpretation that Kobong meant to accept , and whether the interpretation itself is an appropriate one . IV . The Interpretive Points of View and What They Mean 1 . The Form of the Revised Interpretation and an Unresolved Question It is now time to examine the debate . That which brings about the distinction between the Four Beginnings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " that with respect to which one speaks " in the two cases is different . Fundamentally the difference was seen as " the point of view " used in speaking of each being different . This " point of view " in turn became a matter of " that to which they refer " , and // also of " their source of origination " . That is , the difference of " that with respect to which one speaks " itself is due to a difference in " that to which they refer " and in " their source of origination " . Thus when T'oegye says of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings : " Their issuance each has its characteristic pattern ; each has something different to which it refers " , the " characteristic pattern " bespeaks the difference in their source of origination while the last part of the statement brings up the difference of reference . To be sure he also says , " Based on their source of origination each is spoken of with reference to its predominant factor " ( TGCS. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with the difference of reference is already premised on the assumed difference in their source of origination . Therefore in our examination of T'oegye 's interpretation of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings we should examine the question of difference of reference and difference regarding their source of origination as basically separate positions . With respect to these two positions , Kobong says that from the point of view of that to which they refer one may say the Four Beginnings are the issuance of li and the Seven Feelings the issuance of ki , but that can not be said with respect to their source of origination . Although Kobong finally accepted T'oegye 's original formulation his acceptance was totally from the point of view of that to which they refer . To the very end he repeatedly objected to the assertion that there was some difference in their source of origination . Thus in his own response to the Postscript and General Summary T'oegye himself indicated a readiness to get rid of the statement regarding a difference in their source of origination . However the final formulation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Four Beginnings li gives issue and ki follows , in the Seven Feelings ki gives issue and li mounts it " , was as a matter of fact T'oegye 's way of stating the difference in their source of origination . Even though he had to an extent failed in his attempt to argue for the difference in their source of origination T'oegye continued to consider the proposition he had elaborated as a statement of that difference as the expression of his final position . Therefore it goes without saying that if this formulation of T'oegye 's revised interpretation is taken to expresses the same // difference in the feelings ' source of origination that it did in T'oegye 's second letter Kobong would again have to reject it . There is then , still a question here about this formulation of T'oegye 's interpretation : Why did T'oegye think that Kobong had accepted or would accept it ? 2 . The Appropriateness of the Interpretation from the Point of View of Difference of Reference In speaking of his amended interpretation T'oegye added the following comment : Li gives issuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ li as the predominant factor and that does not imply that li is somehow outside of ki ; ki gives issuance and li mounts it , so one can speak with ki as the predominant factor , and it does not mean that ki is apart from li . ( TGCS. , A , 16.36a-b ) So it is just a way of speaking in which li or ki is the predominant factor and does not imply an issuance of li or ki independent of the other . What then is meant by " predominant factor " ? That is explained in terms of the simile of the man mounted on the horse : whether one speaks of the man or the horse as going , the other is already included even with no direct mention . Therefore in speaking from the point of view of such a " predominant factor " there would in fact be no real necessity to add " and ki follows it " or " and li mounts it " to the statements that li gives issue or ki gives issue . This clarification indicates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial statement that " the Four Beginnings are the issuance of li , the Seven Feelings are the issuance of ki . " It seems that the identity of the two formulations when understood in terms of differing points of reference was probably the reason T'oegye thought his position was accepted or would be accepted by Kobong even while he used his revised formulation . But then we may still ask , is this interpretation after all appropriate even from the point of view of differing references ? First , in order to see what T'oegye assumed as the contents and character of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings let us make an // outline summarizing his explanation thus far : Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings A. Spoken of in mutual contrast ( differentiated ) : Difference in the midst of sameness 1 . Difference of that with reference ( respect ) to which one speaks : pure goodness vs. originally good but easily devolving to evil ( good and evil not yet determined ) . 2 . Difference in their source of origination : issued by li vs. externally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spoken of undifferentiatedly ( conjointly ) : Sameness in the midst of difference 1 . That to which they refer : It 's not that there are another Four Beginnings apart from the Seven Feelings ; it 's not that they mean two different things . 2 . Their source of origination : The nature issues as the feelings , which are all stimulated by external things and issue , all mount ki and issue ; li giving issue means those that issue and are perfectly moderated , those which issue with ki in compliance with li . The reason T'oegye says the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings refer to li and ki respectively is that the Four Beginnings are " purely good " while in the Seven Feelings " good and evil are not yet determined " or they are " originally good but easily devolve into evil " . Mencius ' original intention in describing the Four Beginnings was to indicate pure goodness , while the Seven Feelings describe the typical phenomenon of the ordinary man 's feelings : they are fundamentally good but easily stray into evil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings is their respective characteristics relating to good and evil ; that is , for him " pure goodness " and " originally good but easily devolving into evil " are the meanings contained in these feelings . In particular , he views the Four Beginnings as " not considering the involvement of ki " , which means they can never become evil . Looked at in this way they are perfectly and absolutely good , an indication that they are in fact an abstraction . On the other hand when he talks about the Seven Feelings it is not the feelings of the ideal , perfect human being , the // sage , of which he speaks but rather always the feelings of the ordinary man ; here then , he is speaking of actual , concrete feelings . Thus in his handling of them the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings differ in meaning and character . Insofar as they are considered as differing in meaning and character they are naturally different and so must be distinguished from one another . Originally T'oegye further modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it was Kobong who first introduced the term to criticize T'oegye 's formulation . A contrast involves comparing two sorts of thing and thus is premised on an assumed diversity . Therefore in applying the expression " contrastive " to the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings T'oegye from the beginning was seeing them as diverse . Insofar as these sets of feelings are from the start assumed to be thus diverse there is nothing erroneous in the attempt to interpret them as differing from one another . If there is any error , it must rather hinge on whether the conceptualization of the difference in terms of li and ki is in the end suited to what is meant by the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings . According to T'oegye there is a diference between li and ki in terms of " that with respect to which one speaks " being different , and hence each may be interpreted in terms of li and ki . And in fact li and ki as T'oegye speaks of them mean something quite different from one another . The former is the normative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover the two have different properties : li is above the level of concrete form while ki belongs to that level . The one is abstract and universal while the other is concrete and particular . As for good and evil their characteristic meaning likewise differs , li being purely good while the ki has the possibility of becoming either good or evil . All this in fact fits with the characteristics T'oegye sees in the meaning of the Four Beginnings and the Seven Feelings . Therefore in view of their different properties li and ki can be differentiated and one can go on to interpret the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings by categorizing them with li and ki thus differentiated . In this respect one can to a certain extent accept T'oegye 's statement that " the Seven Feelings are to ki as the Four Beginnings are to li " , or his paralleling the distinction with that Chapter 3 . The Four Seven Debate 1 29 between the original nature and the physical nature . But even then one must explain why he had to interpret that distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fa ) " . Originally the feelings were said to be comprised of li and ki in reference to their constitution , that is , the aspect commonly referred to as " substance " . And the actual feelings manifested are the aspect called " function " . This kind of substance - function relationship in the mind-and-heart was ordinarily spoken of in terms of " issuing " or " issuance " . The statements that " the nature issues as the feelings " , or , " the feelings are the issuance of the nature " are examples of this usage , as are " the issuace of li " and " the issuance of ki " . They are symbolic expressions of the logical cause-effect relationship formulated in the terms of substance and function . A discussion of the logical relationship of substance and function is not a discussion of how actual activity takes place : it is completely a matter of the sameness or difference of meaning or of analogical relationships . Therefore the term pal ( " issuance " ) ' ' ) in such phrases is interchangeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Considered in this way T'oegye 's interpretation as a differentiation of objects of reference is to a certain extent appropriate . Fundamentally the point of reference , that is the meaning , is the sort of thing that can be determined at one 's discretion , with the meaning depending on the definition . All the more so in this case , where the assumed meanings of li and ki and the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings are respectively the same , so it amounts to saying similar things are similar ; there is no room for them to have different meanings here . Kobong 's acceptance of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings as the issuance of li and of ki respectively was based , I would suggest , on his understanding T'oegye 's definition of their meaning content ( the sameness or difference of their meaning , or the analogical similarity ) in this way . But why then did Kobong at first assert that " they do not mean two things " , even when he was saying that " that with respect to which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings as respectively " singled out " and " speaking of them in their entirety " . Thus his assumed point of reference for their meaning was not their properties as related to good and evil , as in T'oegye 's case , but rather their extension as signifying part or whole . One might say that while T'oegye was looking to the internal content of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings as his point of reference Kobong was looking to their external relationship for his point of reference for distinguishing them . Therefore even from the point of view of that to which they refer Kobong can not but say , " it 's not that there are separate Four Beginnings apart from the Seven Feelings " , and " it 's not that they mean something different . " Insofar as T'oegye and Kobong had differing points of reference for their meaning , the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings assumed by them were in fact different . This difference in the point of reference , it must be said , was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to which one speaks is not the same " , what they meant by this was something different . Thus the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings in their debate was a case of the same words being used with different meanings . 3 . The Appropriateness of the Interpretation from the Point of View of the Feelings ' Source of Origination First of all , someone may feel that since at the very end in his response to Kobong 's Postscript and General Summary T'oegye eradicated his statement concerning the difference in their source of origination of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings he did not interpret the feelings from this point of view . But if one considers points such as the following it becomes evident that such certainly was not the case . First , even while in his revised interpretation T'oegye seemed to agree with Kobong 's thesis that " as for issuing forth stimulated by external things the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings are both the same " , he used it in the sense that their source of origination is different . That is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they differ in their source of origination. // Second , T'oegye 's getting rid of the statement regarding a difference in their source of origination was not in fact definitive . His language about retracting the statement was quite reserved : " in the end it seems as if it is problematic " . Such an expression leaves room to renew the position if a sufficient basis can be found . Third , as we have already seen , what serves as the basis of his amended interpretation is nothing other than T'oegye 's thesis regarding li and ki 's mutually issuing or mutually possessing the function of issuing . Since this mutual issuance theory was attacked by Kobong and not further discussed by T'oegye , it may seem that he has abandoned it but in fact T'oegye maintained it to the end . Far from abandoning it , one even gets the feeling he emphasized it . Towards the end of his life he asserted not only ki 's ability to give issuance ( tiling pal , neng fa ) but also li 's . About li he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of its original substance ; its being able to give issuance , able to produce , is a matter of its extremely mysterious function . " ( TGCS. , A , 39.28 ) . This is why his name is commonly identified with the thesis of mutual issuance . In the light of this one can hardly say that T'oegye 's amended interpretation was based exclusively on the perspective that considered them as having different points of reference ; the positing of a difference in their source of origination certainly also played a role . Therefore the question of the appropriateness of his revised interpretation necessarily includes an inquiry into this perspective , with a particular focus on its bearing on the thesis of mutual issuance . T'oegye presents his mutual issuance theory as follows : For the individual person is born through a combination of li and ki ; therfore the two of them mutually possess the issuing function . Moreover in the giving issuance they are interdependent . They mutually give issuance , so one can see that each has that in which it predominates ( so chu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are mutually in its midst . Since they are mutually in its midst , there are certainly undifferentiated ways of speaking of it . Since each has that in which it predominates , there is nothing wrong with speaking of it in a differentiated way . ( TGCS. , A , 16. 30h ) Since li and ki " mutually possess the issuing function " or " mutually give issuance " , one can distinguish between them according to their role , // and since being interdependent " they are mutually in its midst " , that is inseparable , one can also speak of the whole without differentiating . Then in the various mentions of " giving issuance " or " issuing function " in this passage , which bespeaks the concrete , phenomenal issuing function of li and ki ? That is , which is an issuing function on the level of the actual issuance that has to do with their real source of origination , rather than an issuing function on the level of what they mean ? It is not the issuing of " they mutually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in giving issuance they are interdependent " . That is the issuance in which they are " interdependent " , " mutually in its midst " , the issuance that belongs to the situation of their inseparability . Therefore the thesis of mutual issuance posed here does nothing to prove a difference in the feelings ' source of origination . Of course apart from this context it is quite possible to hypothesize a mutual issuance that would be an actual issuing function of li and ki . In fact it seems that towards the end of his life T'oegye extended his ideas to this point when he posited an " ability to give issuance " in li . But if li has the actual ability to give issuance , insofar as that means it has the power to act , the distinction and contrast between li and ki disappears . Since T'oegye began with the assumption that li and ki are distinct , that would amount to a self-contradiction . It also contradicts the premise that li and ki are inseparable , a problem Kobong noted when he objected that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculation and activity .... If one goes wrong in this , then one will go wrong in everything " ( WBS. , B , 22b ) . T'oegye , when he said li has the ability to give issuance , differentiated it as function and attributed the aspect of li 's being non-active to substance , finally saying " li 's substance and function are of a single origin " ( TGCS. , A , 41.16b ) ; this , I would suggest , is evidence that he himself recognized the contradiction . Considering this , the thesis that li and ki in fact mutually both give issuance can not be suitable . Thus after this the thesis of mutual issuance can not be adduced as evidence for a difference in whence the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings come . Even putting aside the mutual issuance theory , there is another hypothChapter // esis that might support a differentiation in terms of whence the feelings come . That is , one can hypothesize that T'oegye 's " source of origination " has to do not with the concrete experiential level but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he talked in terms of being " stimulated externally and issuing forth " it is clear that he had a thoroughly actual and experiential sort of " source of origination " in mind , but it need not be completely limited to that . For on the logical level a differentiation in their source of origination supports the thesis regarding the two sets of feelings having different points of reference , and T'oegye himself did not make any precise distinction between these two positions . Thus it is possible that without realizing it he may have thought of a difference in their source of origination from the perspective of the difference in their point of reference . However the response to this sort of hypothesis has already come from Kobong : the nature issues as the feelings . Since the feelings are that which are issued by the nature , the feelings can not be said to be the issuance of ki alone . If the feelings are that which are issued by the nature we have already seen that T'oegye would accept this then on the logical level the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , li . Therefore insofar as the feelings ( the Seven Feelings ) are the issuance of the nature they can not be the issuance of ki alone , and so one can not differentiate even on the logical level between the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings in terms of whence they come . In sum , if one means to maintain the original dualism of li and ki , the purely good Four Beginnings are the feelings that " issue and are perfectly moderated " , and their source of origination is as described by Kobong : " ki gives issue in compliance with li " . On the concrete level when li is the source of origination of a feeling , it is the same thing as what is also termed " the natural manifestation of ki " . Therefore from the perspective of their source the Four Beginnings can not be described as the issuance of li alone . Thus from this perspective neither T'oegye 's amended formulation nor his original position can be said to be appropriate . With this in mind , T'oegye 's statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origination , each is spoken of with reference to // that which is the predominant factor " , can not be accepted . For him not to limit himself to the perspective of different points of reference but to try to support his thesis from the point of view of a difference in the feelings ' source of origin was not reasonable . In particular the thesis of mutual issuance , which ends up with an independent self issuance of li , could be said to be both the central irrationality in his interpretation and also its most distinctive characteristic . If that is so , why , we may ask , did T'oegye so unstintedly pursue this irrational interpretation ? 4 . A Reinterpretation of T'oegye 's Interpretation First let us clarify the question of why T'oegye took his revised interpretation as his final one . It certainly indicates that he considered it superior to his initial formulation . What , then , were the strong points of the amended interpretation in comparison with the first one ? Recalling the way the revised interpretation spoke of how li and ki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to on the level of meaning , we see that the expressions " li gives issuance " and " ki gives issuance " in the formulation , " li gives issuance and ki follows it ? ? ? ki gives issuance and li mounts it " are just the equivalent of " the issuance of li " and " the issuance of ki " in the initial formulation . Then it must be that the element of further precision introduced by the amended formulation is to be found in the additional phrases , " and ki follows it " and " and li mounts it " . These phrases amount to an explication , in the context of li or ki giving issuance , of their mutual presence and interdependence in any active mode . The addition of these phrases , then , makes explicit the mutuality of their presence and interdependence in activity , an aspect which is not expressed by the phrases , " the issuance of li " and " the issuance of ki . " It takes the aspect of inseparability that goes with the undifferentiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into a perspective belonging to a differentiating way of speaking based on the difference of that to which they refer . That this is just the effect T'oegye was looking for is evidenced by his explication // of his revised formulation : One can speak of the feelings with 1i as the predominant factor , that 's all ; it does not mean 1i is apart from ki . One can speak with ki as the predominant factor , that 's all ; it does not mean ki is apart from Ii . ( TGCS. , A , 16.36a-b ) Being able to encompass in this way both aspects of the question is certainly one of the strengths of the revised formulation over the original version , and this is undoubtedly why T'oegye took it as his final interpretation . Of course a consideration of the mode of activity of 1i and ki amounts to thinking about the actual source of the feelings ' origination . Thus the revised interpretation 's attempt to encompass the effects of the undifferentiated mode of speaking of the feelings even while using the differentiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that one could make use of an interpretive approach from the point of view of that to which they refer , and at the same time interpret them from the point of view of their source of origination . Seen in this light , T'oegye 's revised interpretation can be reinterpreted as follows . The Four Beginnings can be said to be the issuance of U. Having said this does not mean that ki is absent . It means that the activity of ki has achieved compliance with ( " follows " ) Ii . The Seven Feelings can be said to be the issuance of ki , and this does not mean that they are the issuance of ki alone . Here also it means 1i is likewise present ( " mounts it " ) . The possibility of interpreting T'oegye 's revised formulation this way does not mean that his formulation itself , presented as a single sentence , is free from any element of contradiction . The reinterpreted form presented above clearly divides two kinds of sentences or statements , the differentiating mode of speaking and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a single sentence . It represents T'oegye 's attempt to fully meet the demands of two contrasting positions at once in a single statement . This is why it can not help ending up in self-contradiction . The fact is that the differing reference approach demands that 1i and ki be discussed apart from one another , while on the contrary // the approach that looks to the feelings ' source of origination , an actual , concrete situation , demands that li and ki be considered together ( especially if li is assumed to be non-active ) . That is , the two positions are premised on contradictory demands . T'oegye 's final irrational assertion that li has " the ability to give issuance ( nrins pal ) is itself a bankrupt stratagem evoked by the demands of this problematic contradiction . If the reason T'oegye came to posit li as having the ability to give issuance is clearly that he took the demands of these two positions or points of view as a single problem , the question is , why did he understand it that way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in T'oegye 's Interpretation In T'oegye 's first letter of response in the debate he had this to say about his approach : In general in one 's approach to the study of meaning and principle ... one should not start by focusing on just a single thesis . Rather one should empty his mind-and-heart and become perfectly even-minded , looking at all the implications and ramifications . Approaching likeness he understands elements of difference , approaching difference he understands elements of likeness . Things may be differentiated as two without it posing a problem with respect to their never being separated ; things may be combined as a unity and in reality end up never being admixed . This constitutes an all encompassing non-partial consideration . ( TGCS. , A , 16.10b ) Thus one should not one-sidedly pursue a single thesis representing just one point of view . Especially in considering a question such as the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings , to get at their complete meaning one must be sensitive to difference in the midst of likeness , likeness in the midst of difference . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of likeness may be evident , from another point of view differences may appear . In dealing with such a matter it is crucial that one know how to embrace the various viewpoints and do justice to their implications , not letting one 's awareness of the unitary , undifferentiated aspect become an obstacle to understanding modes of differentiation and non-identity or vice-versa . Only then will one have a fully rounded grasp that is not // subject to one-sidedness . If one can do this one can have the fruits of the undifferentiated mode of addressing the issue even while taking a contras tive approach , or have the fruits of the contrastive approach even while using the undifferentiated mode . Such was the methodology of T'oegye 's pursuit of learning . One can easily see that such a method would lead him to try to realize the fruit of both points of view whatever the contradic tions might be . But one 's methodology is worked out in the light of the ideal or objective of one 's kind of study . Thus our investigation into the premises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thus far only looked at his methodological assumptions . Now we must look into the ideal or purpose that controlled the formulation of that methodology . The irrational element in T'oegye 's interpretation is mainly a matter of a theoretical contradiction in the way he deals with explaining the concrete matter of the source of the feelings ' origination . In that respect his particular problem is his trying to maintain that li actually gives issuance . Thus the source of the irrationality can be found in his strong inclination to see li as actually giving issuance to the Four Beginnings . According to his argument the possibility of saying the Four Begin nings are the issuance of li is due to the fact that that is in line with the original intention of Mencius . This was recognized not only by T'oegye but by Kobong as well . In fact Mencius used the phenomenal manifesta tion of the Four Beginnings ( especially the dispositions of commiseration and shame for evil ) to infer that humanity , righteousness , propriety , and wisdom constitute the nature of human beings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human nature is good.2 ) Mencius ' original intention in speaking of the Four Beginnings , then , was to establish the thesis that human nature is good . Therefore T'oegye 's emphasizing the Four Beginnings as the self-issuance of li was nothing more than a manifestation of his intention to follow the original intention of Mencius by putting his own learning solidly in line with the thesis that human nature is good . Here one can see that the ideal of T'oegye 's learning and 1 38 CRITICAL ISSUES IN NEO-CONFUCIAN THOUGHT the controlling premise of his methodology was the position that human nature is good . Therefore the irrational element in his interpretation of the question of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings should be understood in the light of his attempt to give full realization to this premise . However this account of T'oegye 's rationale still remains incomplete . The end of learning itself is not simply the pursuit of learning , which is likewise ultimately a means contingent upon the final ideal or goal of learning . In the light of this we should ask why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained it so strongly . If indeed the irrational elements in his interpretation derived from his desire to establish Mencius ' thesis that human nature is good , then what was the value he saw to be gained from that ? If we can understand this we will have grasped what T'oegye saw as the fundamental significance of his interpretation of the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings . 6 . The Significance of T'oegye 's Interpretation First let us recall T'oegye 's criticism of Kobong 's approach and of his thesis : Indeed , pursuing learning while disliking distinctions and concentrating on explanations that fit everything into a unity was characterized by the ancients as " a hawk gobbling dates whole " ; this approach is highly problematic . And if one goes on like this , without even being aware of it one may ineluctably slip into the abuse of discussing the nature in terms of ki and fall into the calamity of thinking of human desires as heavenly principle . How could this be legitimate ! ( TGCS. , A , 16 . I1b-12a ) If the method with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything into a unity " with a marked preference for an " undifferentiated way of speaking " that is , if one follows Kobong 's approach to the interpretation of the feelings rather than T'oegye 's the result will finally be the distortion of " discussing the nature in terms of ki " and " thinking of human desires as heavenly principle " . In other words , though it may introduce an element of irrationality on the level of theory , // if one follows T'oegye 's approach one will be able to thoroughly distinguish li and ki , so when it comes to the mind-and-heart one will be able to distinguish the kind of human desires associated with the ki aspect from what belongs to the normative heavenly principle aspect . In view of this , the strong point and value of T'oegye 's interpretation is that it enables one to solidly establish and maintain the superior position of heavenly principle over human desires . We can look at this once more . What he here calls " discussing the nature in terms of ki " is the element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ki for a single thing " . As a matter of fact if one takes Kobong 's approach and discusses li from the point of view of ki , one ends up with no distinction between li and ki ; it becomes a ki monism . An example is Kobong 's statement that " the original substance of li is nothing more than the natural manifestation of ki " . However on the level of theory there was no mistake in this statement . Therefore even while he criticized it as taking li and ki as one thing T'oegye finally conceded the point . Another example along the same line is Kobong 's statement that what T'oegye described as the purely good " issuance of li " is likewise nothing more than a case where " ki issues in compliance with IV% that is , " the feelings issue and are perfectly moderated " . T'oegye also opposed this on the grounds that it amounted to making li and ki one thing , but here also he finally sent a response conceding the point since on the level of theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for T'oegye it was not exactly theoretical accuracy that was the main thing in the question of interpretation . What was foremost in his mind was the necessity of establishing the transcendence of normative heavenly principle with respect to human desires by somehow or other differentiating li and ki ; this was his ideal objective . What then does it mean concretely to maintain the transcendence of heavenly principle over human desires ? We saw above that in the course of asserting that the Four Beginnings and Seven Feelings could not be just the same reality with different names , T'oegye likened the distinction between them to that between the original nature and the physical nature , explaining this with the simile of '
