<p> The soundtrack is the charming crooning of Maurice Chevalier , coaxing a smile from even the hardest of hearts . " Thank heaven for little girls , " goes the song , but the accompanying images tell another story : elbows fly , shoulders crunch , sweaty women launch basketballs that find nothing but net . <p> It 's the TV spot for the Richmond Rage , Virginia 's entry in the American Basketball League , the women 's pro hoops league that debuted last year . And the ad is punctuated by grunts and thuds designed to send the same macho message as the ABL 's team names  --  Rage , Xplosion , Power , Blizzard , Reign . <p> " Thank heaven they 're on our side , " says the ad 's tagline . <p> But what seems to draw fans to games in Richmond , Hartford , Denver and five more medium-sized markets is not so much the toughness of the players as the style and spirit of play . Women 's basketball as played in the ABL is a back-to-basics game that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . <p> " The game is what I can relate to , " says Bob Crist , an NCAA football official who drives to Rage games from his Charlottesville home . " It 's playing below the rim , seeing the floor , finding the open player . This is the game I know . There 's no thugs , no attitude . I do n't even have daughters . I have two sons and they love this . " <p> If fans like the quality of play on the court , they 're often even more dazzled by what ABL players do before and after games . <p> Players step back into the arena after a game to sign autographs  --  no charge . Ninety minutes before a contest against the New England Blizzard here last week , two Rage players , former Old Dominion all-American Adrienne Goodson and ex-Oklahoma Sooner Etta Maytubby , spent 20 minutes on the court playing two-on-two with two fans , ages 7 and 11 , laughing and encouraging the kids every step of the way . <p> " The NBA is all attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holder who was startled to see her son Andre and niece India mixing it up with the two pros . " These women have a long ways to go before they get that kind of arrogance or that kind of money . " <p> But if the crowd at an ABL game seems like family , it is not a very large clan , even at the bargain price of $ 10 a ticket . Richmond averaged just over 3,000 fans per game this season ( the Rage made the league 's four-team playoffs , and defeated Colorado , 80-77 , in the first game yesterday in Richmond ) . <p> That puts the Rage smack in the middle of the league ; the strongest franchise , New England , averaged about 5,000 per game , while the weakest , Columbus , Ohio , usually played before about 2,500 fans . <p> " We 're 15 percent above our projections , " says Gary Cavalli , co-founder of the ABL , which owns all its teams and has just begun to seek investors in its eight original cities and in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll lose four to five million this year , but we 're where we want to be . Whether we make it will depend on increasing our sponsorship revenues . And obviously broadcast television will facilitate that tremendously . " <p> Some of the first season 's games have been shown on Black Entertainment Television and SportsChannel ( HTS in the Washington area ) , cable channels that reach less than half the nation . The other primary factor in the ABL 's eventual survival  --  the forthcoming Women 's NBA , which starts play in eight NBA cities in June  --  will be on cable 's Lifetime and ESPN , and on the big kahuna  --  NBC , broadcast TV . <p> Interest and participation in women 's basketball has soared in recent years , and the Atlanta Olympics persuaded some network officials that the women 's game can draw the mass audience necessary for TV success . But no one believes two pro leagues can make it . <p> And while the ABL has the advantage in the quality of players ( seven of the 12 Olympic gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries ( an average of $ 70,000 , about double the WNBA 's level ) , the WNBA has three powerful advantages  --  the NBC deal , a slew of corporate endorsements , and the deep pockets of the NBA . <p> " The NBA has the resources to do whatever they want to , " says Rage guard Molly Goodenbour , who helped her Stanford University team to two NCAA championships in the early ' 90s . " The ABL 's in a tougher position . But eventually they 'll merge . For me , the important thing is just to be able to play . Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I ca n't believe I get paid to play basketball . " <p> Goodenbour smiles self-consciously . She 's talking less than an hour after the ABL 's rough-and-tumble game sent her smashing to the Coliseum floor , where she left large chunks of her two front teeth . <p> " She 's a hockey player now , " jokes teammate Dena Evans , a former Virginia Cavalier . <p> It was Goodenbour who inspired the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a California ad agency with Cavalli , was shopping at a mall with one of her daughters when they spotted Goodenbour selling socks for minimum wage . Cribbs and partners soon began raising $ 4 million to give their dream a shot . <p> If Goodenbour is grateful for the chance to come in from the mall , many other ABL players were thrilled to come home from overseas pro leagues  --  until this year , the only available basketball-playing employment for women . <p> Some players take their role as evangelists for the women 's game so seriously that they go far beyond what the team requires of them : Rage reserve Maytubby has been to every home game this season at Richmond 's John Marshall High School . " She showed us how to post up , " says Shanese Hughes , 15 . " She comes to our practices , she talks to us . I want to play in the ABL . " <p> But women 's pro leagues have a universal record of failure in this country  --  the most recent attempt , the 1991 Liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a basket lower than 10 feet , died in a year . For either the ABL or the WNBA to make it will require " that they carefully market these players as legitimate world-class athletes rather than as girls playing sports , " says Robert Madrigal , professor of sports marketing at the University of Oregon 's Lundquist College of Business . <p> Corporate sponsorships , along with TV contracts the lifeblood of pro sports , will eventually discover women 's leagues , Madrigal says , because " Most purchases are made by women , and that 's not going to be lost on Madison Avenue . And the women make very compelling role models . They 're not as spoiled as the men . " <p> The hard-charging ABL game is already winning raves from fans tired of NBA dunks and selfish run-and-gun play . There 's plenty of flash in the women 's game  --  Tuesday 's contest brought the crowd to its feet with behind-the-back passes , no-look assists and brute-force steals . But the ABL is about fundamentals ; as of last week , the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Whatever the women 's on-court advantages , marketers say the ABL and WNBA must learn a lesson from the 1996 Olympics and focus on players ' life stories rather than simply touting team statistics . " The Olympics taught us that women are more interested in the drama  --  athletes overcoming adversity  --  while men are attracted to the technical side , the numbers , " Madrigal says . <p> Rage General Manager Tammy Holder , formerly the women 's coach at the University of Richmond , has her team 's NBC-style stories at the ready  --  Rehema Stephens is an ordained minister , Evans is a math teacher who was a finalist for a Rhodes scholarship , Kirsten Cummings was born with only 30 percent of her hearing , and so on . <p> Women and girls make up most of the crowd at a Rage game . But while the ABL is eager to expand the ranks of female fans , league officials know that to succeed in the long run , they must reach men , and even men who do n't have daughters . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to league research . <p> But some fans say male interest is only a matter of time . " That 'll happen , " says George Tillman , 50 , an accountant who attends every Rage home game with his work partners and teenage daughters . " This is more of a team effort than the men 's game . It 's like the game was when I was young . " <p> Little things about the ABL appeal to fans . It 's not only 6-foot forward Goodson 's staccato bursts of hustle and rebounding prowess , but the way so many ABL players acknowledge fouls readily , their hand shooting up in the air , followed by sheepish smiles and even quick apologies to teammates . It 's the way opposing players hug and laugh with each other at the end of even a hard-fought battle like the Rage 's 83-82 heartbreaker loss to the Blizzard on Tuesday . <p> Ten minutes after that disappointment , 1996 Olympian and University of Virginia star Dawn Staley was hugging young girls behind the stands , signing autographs and asking her middle-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's going to take more creativity to get the endorsements and make this work , " says Goodenbour . " I mean , we 're never going to dunk . We 're never going to be as powerful as the men . But when I was growing up , we did n't have women role models . And now , hopefully , we can be the real role models , more than the men are for sure . " <p> That night , the late sports news on one Richmond TV station led with basketball , but it was n't the Rage game . It was the opening round of the local high school tournament  --  the boys games . <p> Over on the next channel , the sportscast also started out with basketball . Again , the Rage would have to wait . This time , the lead hoops story was also high school action . But this station led with the girls .
