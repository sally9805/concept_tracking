What is it about baseball that commands the attention of grownup men ? Some might ask the identical question about our other national pastime , politics . Contributor Walter Shapiro , author of this week 's lament on the parlous state of the major leagues , has had ample experience with both obsessions . He nearly won a primary for Congress in Michigan in 1972 and was later a speechwriter for President Carter . His assignments since joining TIME in 1987 have been mostly in politics , including months last year tracking Bill Clinton . <P> While on Clinton 's trail , Shapiro slipped away from the press pack to catch 15 ball games . He was n't the only one . " I 'm surprised at the number of political reporters who are passionate baseball fans , " he says . " I think it has to do with small boys and numbers . " He got hooked on baseball statistics at age eight and was drawn as well to election-return tables . He had already been notified by the Little League coaches of Norwalk , Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the field . <P> The boyhood baseball hobby died out , but Shapiro , like many others , rediscovered it in adulthood . The original attraction in his case was the Baltimore Orioles of the late 1970s . Now Shapiro is more Bird-brained than ever , since Baltimore has erected the neo-nostalgic Camden Yards field , which he saluted in his last baseball opus for TIME in 1991 . <P> Shapiro is eight years into a related addiction , Rotisserie League Baseball , invented by LIFE managing editor Dan Okrent and named for a defunct Manhattan restaurant . This week Shapiro joins 11 otherwise sane " club owners " at a tavern for a fantasy auction of every player in the American League . The pennant winner shows the best aggregate statistics at season 's end . Shapiro hopes that reporting for this week 's story will give him a scouting edge . <P> Unlike politics , Shapiro says , covering baseball " teaches you the greatest gift for a writer or reporter : humility . " While on his spring-training rounds , he found himself at a St. Petersburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could hear them murmur about things I did n't see and whisper things I did n't understand . " Shapiro believes that politicians would benefit from a similar immersion in humility : " It might be a wonderfully leveling experience for the egos of political leaders if for one campaign season they , like ballplayers , allowed reporters to interview them while they were half- undressed .
