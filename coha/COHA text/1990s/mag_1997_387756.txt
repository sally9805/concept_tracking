Across the country , observatories are experiencing funding cuts . Kitt Peak is resolving the challenge and inspiring the public at the same time . // If your idea of a dream vacation is scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef , you simply call a travel agent who will find you dozens of services that will train you to use the equipment , drop you off at the best dive location , and provide food and lodging . In fact , it 's not difficult to find the same level of service involving premiere sites for almost any other outdoor activity , be it golfing , skiing , or taking a safari . Until now , amateur astronomers could only dream of having it so good . Five years ago , I endured a trip that , among other hardships , involved lugging a 100-pound telescope through airports en route to remote regions of Chile . Several times I wished in vain to have the equipment awaiting my arrival at the final destination . Well , with the recent renovation of the visitor program at Kitt Peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 1996 , Kitt Peak has welcomed as many as 20 people per night to spend several hours on the mountain learning about the observatory 's research programs , taking an " immersion course " in astronomy , and most importantly , gazing at the southwestern sky . Astronomy did n't have to ask twice for me to give the Kitt Peak Nightly Observing Program a go . Located on the Tohono O'Odham Reservation , the mountain is a short drive from Tucson , Arizona . Its majestic form rises steeply from the Sonoran Desert into skies known to be clear and dark . The drive up the mountain to the observatory is an adventure in itself ; the road transforms rapidly from straight and flat to near vertical with hairpin twists . Each turn bestows on those daring enough to make the trip a more spectacular view of the valley below than the turn before . When I gained the 6,875-foot summit at the Visitors Center , I was mesmerized ; I found myself surrounded suddenly by the observatories that had teased me during my approach . For a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were here , nestled in the Quinlan Mountains . I could see the WIYN telescope dome in the distance , and the 2.1-meter and two others beyond it . The 4-meter observatory , a 94-inch half-dome and the 0.9-meter Space Watch dome stood behind me . The sharply-angled structure that houses the Solar Observatory filled my next view . I was in an astronomer 's paradise and had n't even left my car . Daytime visitors to Kitt Peak clear out at 4 p.m . Only those with reservations for the Nightly Observing Program may stay on the mountain with the astronomers and technicians . Each participant is handed a pair of 7x50mm binoculars , a planisphere , and a red flashlight for use during the session . The group convenes for dinner and to watch an introductory video , " Astronomy 101 . " Then everyone embarks on a magnificent journey through the universe by public program director Adam Block . Using a 16-inch SchmidtCassegrain telescope , Block shows the group examples of a planet , a multiple star system , a planetary nebula and open and globular clusters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The program begins 30 minutes before sunset and lasts for three hours . Though not widely publicized , it is typically fully booked many weeks in advance . For the amateur astronomer in pursuit of the perfect dream vacation , Kitt Peak offers an advanced program . One or two amateurs are treated to an entire night on the mountain , beginning three hours after sunset - just after the conclusion of the Nightly Observing Program . An SBIG ST-7 CCD camera and a full set of eyepieces complement the equatorially mounted scope on a rock-solid pier . Visitors can send images they captured in the night to their homes electronically or save them on a 100 MB Zip cartridge . With the telescope 's computer interface to The Sky software , locating objects requires no more than knowing an identification number and watching the scope slew . The entire assembly is enclosed in an 18-foot Ash dome , providing the protection needed from winds commonly present . One brisk February evening , I was the privileged pilot observer for this program . Having become a connoisseur of Arizona 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in checking the quality of a site as important as Kitt Peak . With Tucson 's 700,000 people just 60 miles away , I was pleasantly surprised to find a relatively small light dome to the east , affecting no more than 10 percent of the sky . A much smaller glow from Phoenix can be seen a hundred miles to the north , but one need n't worry about either of these population hubs interfering with observing . Sit back and wait for objects to rise away from the cities and into the dark sky . The only remaining lights of any significance come from the small community of Sells , 15 miles away and nearly a mile below . What 's more , lighting ordinances in Arizona ensure that Kitt Peak will remain a dark sight for years to come . It had been cloudy since early afternoon , but a clearing line rested enticingly over the western horizon well into the night . Satellite image downloads suggested that clear sky would move our way , but when ? As any good amateur astronomer would , I took advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of the hobby with Kris Koenig , the visitor center 's administrator . The driving force behind Kitt Peak 's latest changes , Koenig is passionate about promoting " astro-tourism .

Photograph The author stands next to Kitt Peak 's 16-inch scope used for public observing programs . // Many national observatories face debilitating funding cuts . Koenig hopes the newly-developed programs will excite people about astronomy and help them see it as important and valuable . Kitt Peak National Observatory director Richard Green has similar expectations . He considers the new public program " a great way to reach our community and let them understand what is going on at the observatory . " Peaking my excitement about astronomy was no challenge , and by 11 p.m. the clouds began to move away . The sparkle of winter Milky Way stars in Monoceros and Puppis blazed well down into an inky southern horizon , where Canopus , the often neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a little cold to this desert dweller , but they really were n't bad for a February night . To the northwest , the 18-story dome of the giant Mayall 4-meter telescope could be seen silhouetted against the setting constellation Cassiopeia . In the opposite direction , the sail of Corvus rose over the graceful structure of the McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope . I 'd recently ordered my own CCD camera . Eagerly awaiting its arrival , I wanted to try my hand at some imaging . I was amazed by how easy it was to acquire an image . I imaged the star cluster M46 with its planetary nebula NGC 2438 using a feature that allows observers to accumulate several short exposures . I moved to the Orion Nebula and then to the Horsehead Nebula , taking sets of 10-second exposures and performing simple image processes on each object . Excited and in an astrophotographer 's mindset , I was amazed to learn how the four Trapezium stars could be extracted from the deep image that revealed outer filaments in the Orion Nebula . The experience made me all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Block was helpful to have nearby  --  ready to assist , but never in the way . My body cried for a rest at about 2:30 a.m. , so I retired for a short nap before comet-rise . I was back at it at 5:30 a.m. as Comet Hale-Bopp gained a respectable elevation in the eastern sky . Using a pair of binoculars , I estimated the length of the ion tail at 7 degrees . The comet remained a capitavating naked-eye sight in the rising twilight . Uncomfortable cold and sleepdeprived at this point , I still could n't resist staying up for the sunrise . These are the most peaceful hours at the observatory , just as the astronomers are going to sleep . Surrounded by the beautiful sight of domes basking in the colors of twilight , I was energized by the spectacle of the setting shadow of the peak projected on the atmosphere . The domes closed around me , and only early-rising birds broke the silence .

I 'd sat down to dinner with professional astronomers who chattered excitedly around me about their research . I 'd been catered to while looking through a permanent scope at the Summer Milky Way at the largest observatory in the country on a February morning . It was the stuff of dreams . Kitt Peak 's visitor program indeed helped me realize a childhood dream and provided an amazing experience I will never forget .
