For more than a year , I thought Roman had disappeared from my life . If not for our very adequate postal service , he might have , but the last week of August , I open the mailbox to find an envelope that has been stamped : Moved No Forwarding Address , with an arrow drawn to the return address , tiny and wispily written in the upper left corner : Roman Kelber , clo Janet Peacham , rr. ii , box 8 , Frankfort , ME . There is no zip code . The arrow , drawn freehand , has been traced over several times , so that it is as bold as the return address is faint . The letter is addressed to a woman I do n't know , Deirdre Sm the , in Providence , Rhode Island . Why Roman was writing her , and why he should have written his return address in care of me , is a mystery , but somehow I hesitate to open the envelope . What do you ever find out , with Roman , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconclusive ? Also , it is n't my mail . It is his mail , which he has apparently , for reasons of his own , indicated should be returned to me . <p> Roman visited the Maine house several times the summer Danny and I moved in-the year of the hurricane . A disastrous time , with a storm of sorts going on inside the house as well , caused by Roman and his lady friend , which exacerbated and complicated the problems Danny and I were having . But I 've done my best to put that period out of my mind , and my resolve has been pretty effective , until the day I get the letter . <p> I hold it up to the light and run my thumb along it in horizontal lines , but I am hoping the words will be indecipherable , and they are , so that 's a relief . <p> I consider opening it , but reflexively stop , hearing my mother 's voice saying , " You never open another person 's mail : ' <p> I look all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Roman , like one of those drawings for children in which the artist hides various animals in bushes and cleverly disguises trees as elongated , vertical wolves , might be watching me and taking in my reaction . That is so paranoid that I immediately get another thought . <p> Being : Call Howie and tell him about the letter . See what Howie thinks . <p> Howie is my best friend . According to my ex-lover , Danny , he was a big part of the problem . As was Roman , of course . All those odd people imposing on him , ruining the silence , making their overt and covert demands on my time . The way I saw it , they had been my family before I met Danny , and I was n't going to boot them out because I had a live-in boyfriend . I thought we had arrived at some solutions : guests on the weekends , not during the week ; objectionable music listened to through headphones ; consult Danny before mowing the lawn or trimming the bushes . You 'd think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the yard , but the noise of the lawn mower distracted him , he said . And sometimes he was painting the bushes , including them in one of his landscapes , so what was he going to do when they were suddenly dwarfed , just inflate them again in his imagination ? He called Roman and Howie " the swallows , " from the old song about the swallows returning to Capistrano , because he insisted on seeing them as homing pigeons , returning always to myour-home . These were the things Danny said to his friends on the telephone . He 'd have his friends think Roman and Howie were the gaping mouth that swallowed the cars of screaming couples as they rode into the fun house . He felt that Howie and Roman expected him to sit with his hands in his lap , listening , being subjected to whatever their speculative fun ride of the day turned out to be : anti-Lacan ; pro-abortion ; anti-Castro ; propuppy . It really made him nervous that there might be a dog . He knew it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible : no marriage ; no babies ; no family obligations unless the request was made in obvious desperation . <p> I was n't the only one who found him frustrating and uncompromising . I often remember Danny at his parents ' fiftieth wedding anniversary , dancing with their neighbor , Mrs. Hill . Danny 's sister 's eyes had been trained on them , narrowed , as if by adjusting the distance between her upper lid to her lower in a fierce squint , she could lock them in place , keep Danny dancing with Mrs. Hill . That party was only a few weeks before the hurricane . He was furious that when we got home that night , Roman was there with a woman , screwing her on the floor of the study , while Jay Leno stood there giving his monologue on the television . <p> " It makes it seem like I 'm a disapproving parent , and I do n't have the slightest interest in playing that role , " Danny said sulkily , upstairs in our bedroom , taking off his suit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing the jacket and trousers on the floor . <p> " If you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em , " I said , slipping out of my clothes and lying on top of his discarded suit . <p> " What is this ? " he said . " Three-dimensional sex , like threedimensional tick-tack-toe ? Probably Howie is down in the basement going at it with whatever man or woman he 's picked up also ? " <p> But that particular night , he knew Howie was n't there . Roman had come alone , because Howie was at a funeral . Howie was n't having any fun , sexual or otherwise . He 'd already left a message on the machine saying he was so bummed out he did n't even plan to drive from Newburyport for the weekend . And Roman and his girlfriend had already told me they 'd be going to a party in Vinalhaven-in fact , we expected them to be gone when we returned , but that was Roman : no sense of time ; a conviction that what you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , the weekend , I thought at that point , was going to be just the two of us , just the way Danny liked it . But then the weather changed . There was a day 's lull , during which Roman and Kathleen still did not leave for the party , and during which time Howie changed his mind and hopped a bus-Roman had Howie 's car-and we picked him up at the Greyhound stop in front of the drugstore . Danny picked him up , because I was cooking . <p> Danny was not all bad . He was a talented painter , a generous man when the spirit moved him , and funny : he could mimic anyone . That night , in the bedroom , he screwed up his face to look like poor old Mrs. Hill 's , and imitated the dance as she 'd done it , favoring her right leg , trying to smile through her pain . Every so often he would stop and pretend to pick up the imaginary person and toss her to the ceiling , or drop-kick her-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not always nice . It had me weeping with laughter : Danny , in his boxer shorts , recreating his earlier attempt at a fox trot , his caricature of his partner 's gimpiness so convincing that I really saw her in the room , though she was elsewhere , and no doubt long asleep . <p> " You want to know what to do with a letter sent by Roman to some woman that got returned to you , " Howie says . I can hear him tapping his finger on his computer . He 's been playing a video game . It sounds like large things are quickly devouring small things : a combination roar and shriek . Howie works at home , designing publications on his desktop publishing system . As he works , he often listens to music , plays games on his portable computer , and converses with whoever calls through the speakerphone . Eating or drinking something would also not be out of the question . For people of our generation , this simultaneous taking in of stimuli is n't all that unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning through their effects . These days , Howie only has the occasional beer , but he 's retained his taste for constant input . I can hear the Japanese rock ' n ' roll in the background . When Howie 's playing a computer game and listening to weird music , you can guess the rest : Diet Coke ; underwear or pajama bottoms ; blinds dropped and lights out , the computer screen and the Jesus nightlight glowing . <p> " You know , " Howie says , " I was just talking to somebody about Roman . And she predicted he was going to get back in touch . Maybe tomorrow a letter will be returned to me . " <p> " Who were you talking to who said that ? " <p> " A psychic . " <p> " You 're kidding me . " <p> " No , " he says . <p> " Well , let 's hear . You went to a psychic . Was the psychic any good ? " <p> " She had Girl Scout cookies on the table by her chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you consult a psychic about , Howie ? " <p> " Whether I should take the job in Silicon Valley . " <p> " And ? " <p> " I should , and rearrange my priorities , or I should stay where I am and admit that my current priorities make it impossible for me to move to California . " <p> " We 're talking Alice VanVleet ? " <p> " I thought you never wanted to hear her name again . You just spoke the offending name . " <p> " I 'm trying to find out about the psychic . " <p> " She impressed me . Had the mint Girl Scouts , not those newfangled ones . She knew Alice 's name without being told . Your significant other is named either Alice or Ann . ' " <p> Alice VanVleet is a bored , middle-aged fag hag . She dumps all her problems on Howie and expects him to make her complicated meals , besides , to which she contributes things she buys at the store , like bottled , fat-free salad dressing and wine only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the refrigerator . Once , I got roped into going with Howie to her condo for dinner , and she spent the whole evening eyeing me every time I poured from her bottle of chardonnay , talking about her ex-husband 's unwillingness to-as she put it-parent the children , all three of whom were in their mid- to late twenties and still living with her . From what she said , they seemed to do nothing but " be associated with " the Church of Christian Science and indulge their passion for sports . <p> " Did she know Alice VanVleet ca n't hold a job ? " <p> " And she said you were a cynical bitch , and I should stay away from you , " he says . <p> It takes a second , but when he snorts , self-satisfied , I know he 's kidding . <p> " Now , " he says . " Now : you have a letter and you 're calling me to see what to do about it . I would suggest , if you 've got an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anything else you want . My treat . What to give the girl who has everything . " <p> Another snort . When Danny left , he took half of everything . Everything consisted of his aunt 's Limoges , a large collection of unisex winter clothing , such as long johns and down parkas , Salvation Army re-covered chairs , a sisal rug which he had drawn on with Magic Marker to make it look like marble ( he took the rug ) , woven throw rugs with pug dogs on them we 'd picked up at curbside in Somerville , Massachusetts ( he left those ) , antiques bought cheap at auction , and the mahogany sleigh bed , which left me the mattress and box spring on which I sit as I talk to Howie , pleasantly distracted by my dislike of Alice VanVleet . <p> Abracadabra , and I 'm in Howie 's Chevy convertible , and we 're off to see the wizard . Well-it takes him almost an hour to get to my house , but when he does pull in , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough that the top can be down , resolved to either not mention Alice VanVleet or to say something nice about her , since Howie is so counter-suggestible . He fell in with Alice , come to think of it , just at the time he and Roman had the big fight . I 'm not even sure who was to blame : apparently Howie backed out of going halves on a house in Umbria when he heard that Roman 's girlfriend would be along , and Roman accused him of general cheapness and of having secretly made his own plans to invite what he sneeringly called The Cambridge Ladies , so it was hypocritical to pretend Roman had been the one to ruin the plans . It 's always push-pull with Roman and Howie , though . They 've had many of these fights , in which they have n't spoken for months , or even for a year or more . " He 's such a prima donna , " Howie has often complained to me . " He 's so selfabsorbed , he always wants to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen watching me cook like he 's fucking standing at the end of the runway crowned as Miss America . Have you noticed the way he stands around , as if he 's soaking in approval , as if everybody is just so fucking thrilled to see him preening while onions are being sliced ? " <p> The psychic wears a beautiful intaglio ring and has delicate , long fingers with enviably manicured nails . She 's younger than I expected-probably late thirties . She 's painted the walls an odd lavender that seems to glow pink within . There is a ring of chairs in the center of the room , and nothing else except a small table next to the chair she sits in and , against the far wall , another table on which sits an answering machine , blinking . The overhead light is on a dimmer switch , and the room is neither bright nor dark . I briefly imagine Howie squirming in one of the chairs , talking to the psychic as if she were a giant daisy he could pluck , to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the petals gone , he would know , and she would be as she is now , her thin body in a longish green dress resembling a flower stem , her neat bubble of dark hair all that would remain : the black , black center of the daisy . What I at first take as a Cindy Crawfordesque mole is actually a crumb , I see , as she licks it away . Today the cookies are n't on the table , though . Instead , she 's reading a Jane Austen novel . Psychic myself , I realize the Chapstick must indicate she has dry lips . <p> " Yes , " she says , " I can tell you what 's in the envelope . " <p> It sits where I placed it when I first came in , on top of Pride and Prejudice . She looks at it . I look at it . <p> " It 's a map , " she says . <p> " But what does the letter say ? " I ask . Outside , I can faintly hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There is no letter , " she says . " It 's just a map . " <p> " A map to what ? " <p> " Buried treasure , " she says . <p> I laugh . Instantly , before I can check my reaction . Buried treasure ? <p> The perfectly painted fingernails play church and steeple . " The person has drawn a box . A pirate 's chest . With a skull and crossbones on the lid . Pearls inside , it seems to me . " <p> " You ca n't tell ? " <p> She closes her eyes . Her fingers rest not on the envelope , but on one knee . <p> " It 's a stereo , " she says . " That 's what 's inside the chest . There 's an amp . Receiver . Wireless speakers . CDs and tapes are dumped in the chest , too " <p> " You 're serious ? " I say . " Can you tell what the music is ? " " A pretty eclectic lot , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They 're all musicians Roman loves . In fact , when I picked up a People magazine in the dentist 's office recently , I wondered if Roman had heard that Marianne Faithfull was coming out with a new album . I had been thinking about him , shortly before the envelope arrived . <p> " Are you interested in anything besides the envelope ? " she says . <p> " Your intaglio- " I begin . <p> " Zeus ; ' she says . " The stone is an old carnelian : ' <p> " Beautiful , " I say . I lean forward in my chair . " The setting is rose gold , is n't it ? It 's so beautiful , but so simple : ' <p> " Rose gold , " she echoes . " Simple , yes . The setting is simple ; he was n't . " <p> " I beg your pardon ? " <p> She says , sounding slightly world-weary , " A complicated man , Zeus . Like so many others . " <p> " My friend Howie- " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to ask , but still I hesitate , because I do n't want to hear the answer . I want to know about his health , exactly how long I can plan on our being able to knock around together . Most of all , I want to know , and do not want to know , the day and time of his death . And : what exact thing will that death also kill off in me ? My sense that the world can be a pleasant place ? My love of gardening , because every flower might forever after look like what I 'd seen in a spray of flowers at a funeral ? Morbid . Morbid . The thoughts I always quickly push out of my mind , though after a while they assert themselves as a headache . <p> " See the pyramids ... , " Patsy Cline sings from Howie 's tape deck . My question unfinished , the psychic waits politely . Does this mean she ca n't read my mind ? Or that she is n't obliged to , if I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She adjusts the ring , twirling it slightly with her right hand . It makes me wonder whether it might be possible that she 's finding the answers in Zeus 's head , not her own . <p> " Your friend , " she says , tired of waiting for me to speak . " I think your friend will soon transcend his personal problems . " It 's not until I 'm in the car that I realize what she said could be interpreted two ways , and that the second of those ways might be transcendence through death . I turn to him , and he is as real , as solid , as the car itself . He looks bright-eyed , healthy . Happy , even . <p> " See Janet Peacham 's life passing before her eyes , " I say . " What remains constant ? That Howie and Janet go on excellent adventures , consulting psychics about how everything will be . " I look at him . " Do you realize you just spent a hundred bucks to receive news of buried treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out to be ? Not jewels and gold coins , but stereo equipment . He must be telling her he 's bought her a stereo in lieu of a dozen red roses . " Here , though , I bog down , considering this . " Do you think he drew her a map to tell her where to find her present ? " I say finally . <p> " Open it , " he says . " Let 's see where it 's buried . " <p> " Then what ? We go excavating ? We find it , and what do we do ? Take it over to the woman 's house and tell her , Hey , here , this is from Roman ' ? " I slide lower in the seat . " I 'm sure he 's given it to her by now . " <p> " But if he has n't , " Howie says , " if for any reason he has n't , it falls to us . Correct me if I 'm wrong here , but this Smythe woman does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouncing back to you , all but hollering , Open Me ! Open Me ! What do you say , we go there , dig up the lady 's treasure , keep it in the garage , if you want , until he shows up , and then tell him that the joke 's on him . We both know he 's showing up , right ? Did the psychic tell you he was going to get back in touch with you , too ? " <p> It breaks my heart . Under any conditions , he wants us back together again . Not just him and Roman , Howie and Roman and Janet-and we 've all become such different people . Is there any chance that if we met now , for the first time , we 'd still be drawn to each other ? Of course , I 'm more fond of Howie than anyone else I can think of , but that 's because he revealed himself to me so long ago , because our friendship evolved , because we 've lost our families , and friends have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break down Howie 's barriers if I met him today . And Roman : did either of us , ever , really get close to Roman , or is he still orbiting around us , teasing , no greater possibility he 'll plunge to earth than your average meteor ? <p> " He follows through on everything , " Howie says , thinking out loud . He 's completely caught up in this ; he 's experiencing it as virtual reality . " And if she does n't write him a thank-you note , or whatever it is he expects , he 'll get in touch with you and make some half-assed explanation about it all , and , bottom line , he 'll want to know if his goods are okay . " <p> " Let sleeping dogs lie , " I say . <p> " Yeah , but buried Bang and Olufsen ? " <p> " What does it matter ? Why involve ourselves in some peculiar courtship ritual of Roman 's ? I can pretend not to know anything about it , particularly when I return the sealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming , " Howie says . <p> " Yeah , " I say , surprised , myself , at the tone of defeat in my voice . " I know he 'll show up eventually . " I look out the window . No pyramids , though Patsy Cline is trying to conjure them up for me ; just the shopping center . <p> " He 's in love again , " Howie says . <p> Years ago-many years ago-Roman was in love with Howie . When Roman became infatuated with me , it became a triangle . Then Danny came along and struck the side , and took me away . Danny has always been militantly heterosexual , but it intrigued him that I was bisexual . He 'd missed the sixties sitting around graduate school , studying law , as his parents insisted he do , until he finally took a stand , dropped out of school , and worked at a dull job in an accounting firm , and then , when he 'd saved enough money , went to art school . He 'd had several successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London , where a gallery was representing him at the time . Later , the gallery owner jumped out the window , and the gallery folded . Then we went to Seattle . Then we went to Washington , when Danny got a job with the State Department , before he quit trying to work at pointless jobs just for the money and decided to devote all his time to painting . When he did resign , we were lonely because for some reason his friends from work all seemed to gradually drop him , and there we were , back in the States without our friends from Europe , or our friends from the Pacific Northwest . So we moved to a summer home in Maine and invited my old friend Howie to visit us , and who did Howie bring but Roman ? They 'd just gotten back in touch , after a month-long snit , and Howie thought it would be perfect if their reunion included me . To my surprise , nothing was there : no frisson , no deep feeling at all , except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , though I 'd often talked about Howie , I 'd never really discussed Roman with Danny . <p> Soon Roman began to drop by the house alone . He was n't flirting with me , I quickly decided ; he was a little put out I had n't kept in touch , and he was jealous of my happiness , but for a while I actually thought he wished me well . He was never charitable toward Howie , so why would I have thought he 'd feel kindly toward me ? What happened next was that he asked if he could introduce us to his younger sister , who had seen one of Danny 's paintings in New York and greatly admired his work . You can guess the rest : Danny fell in love with Roman 's sister . She was a senior at Yale , a Fine Arts major , a painter herself . A winsome little thing , physically small , at five foot one , with her Janis Joplin tumbleweed hair and sparkly vests she wore over T-shirts to cover her flat little breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing too-short cutoffs and **25;689;TOOLONG mules , her pink polished toes protruding from the little vee in front , her pumiced pink heels naked in back . So Howie and I grew closer , as we 'd been back in undergraduate school , taken aback by Roman 's outlandish offering of his sister , Marielle , who so gladly modeled for Danny in exchange for critiques of her paintings . <p> Meanwhile , Roman began to show up on the weekends with an assortment of girlfriends . There had been other periods when he saw women exclusively , but this time his interest was lasting longer than usual . Danny and I never found the women much fun , though , and they tended to baffle Howie . Their conventionality bothered me , and the sheer quantity of them offended Howie , who was used to the occasional foray into heterosexuality , but still : young women in Ann Taylor business suits whom Roman , it turned out , had picked up on the train ? One of them was there the afternoon the hurricane blew up , a paralegal named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in the trailer that had belonged to the former caretaker when we bought the house . In retrospect , I think she might have been too shy , or embarrassed , to spend much time with us . Roman was fifteen years older than she , and he took every occasion to let her know he had greater wisdom . Did she really care for him ? When she returned to me the jeans and tops , the underwear and nightgown , I 'd lent her-she expected to be there only for dinner-something about the way she handed back the soiled , neatly folded clothes made me think she valued them , and I had seen her express none of that care , none of that respectful carefulness , toward Roman . She had spoken little in his presence . There seemed no joy there . All of which reminded me of Roman 's trial by fire of me and of Howie , years before . We had stood our ground and prevailed . We had won , in a way-though look what that winning got both of us : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronouncements like flash floods , waves of information about the way things should be ( his way ) . <p> The trailer kept its power when the main house went black . From our various rooms , and for our various reasons , we 'd look at that beacon in the night , glowing oddly , the nucleus stained to shine under the microscope . It was obvious that Danny had begun to desire Marielle ; I had begun to desire-not to physically desire , but to depend upon with a kind of fierce desperation that my trust be returned-Howie , the one person who could best understand my own surprise and confusion at the way events were shifting . Wind blew . Wine was uncorked to toast its wildness . Candles burned to stubs . The power lines were down , and it was dark , dark , dark-except for the constant glow of what Howie came to dub " the love boat , " the trailer sinking into the muddy field . Roman took long walks around the wet , windlashed land , no doubt malevolently whistling as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny was working as forcefully as if he had been able , himself , to whip up a storm and permanently alter the ground we stood on . <p> Roman , returning ? Howie has to be right , but what is this strange approach ? And if-as he 'd written to Howie in a letter after the hurricane-he has nothing to feel guilty about , but only feels sorry that he has to be honest in telling Howie that the menopausal Cambridge Ladies are too pointless and depressing to be part of his planned idyll in Italia . . . if , as he maintains , it is his curse to have become the messenger who has to reveal Danny 's lack of love for me . . . if he is only poor Rosencrantz , or poor Guildenstern , and if he 's been functioning blindly and blamelessly , why disappear for so long ? He left his job , put the brownstone in the South End on the market , moved out before it was sold ( we heard this from Roman 's mother , who was searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a self-justifying letter , which he mailed from St. Thomas to his mother in New York and to his father in Palm Beach , with a " cc " at the bottom to Mr. Daniel Obersham ( Mr. ? ! ) and to a psychiatrist he 'd seen many years before , as well as leaving a copy tacked to the door of his office ( the histrionic flourish has never been lost on Roman ) , claiming that the negative energy released during the hurricane , combined with the toxic effects he now doubted he would ever overcome , following his years of chemical dependency , had left him with unmanageable emotions that often took on a life of their own , causing him to provoke those he loved . Only on Howie 's letter was there an asterisk-at least , there was no footnote to the letter Roman 's mother forwarded to Howie , and the psychiatrist told Howie on the phone that there was no physical mark , including a signature , on the letter he received . The asterisk was not typed , but hand-drawn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it flies too close to your face . At the bottom of Howie 's letter , underneath a larger , darker cluster of splayed strokes , was written : You I have hurt most , not even Janet , yet you know I love you , Howie . <p> Well , indeed . Indeed Howie did know it , but for most of the time he 'd known Roman , that love had been a confusing thing , announced at odd times , something Roman used to manipulate Howie , a standard , almost , to which Howie could either measure up or , more often , and just as pleasing to Roman , fall short of . <p> For more than a year after the hurricane , everyone felt they had had more than enough of everyone else , and even Howie and I hardly talked . I received one drunken phone call late at night from Danny and listened for only a few seconds before I hung up . If it had n't been for the excruciatingly bad news that Howie tested HIV-positive-if he had n't called me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to talk because of his chattering teeth-I might have continued to stay separate from all of them . The voice control button had been activated on my answering machine , and when I heard that it was Howie , and what Howie was saying , I slowly slid the volume down to off for one second in which to compose myself before I picked up the receiver . The one second stretched to two , three-enough time for many emotions to sift through my understanding : the shock ; the acceptance of the unthinkable ; a hundred plans for reversing the news ; vivid memories of my friendship with Howie , from meeting at age eighteen until that moment , which seemed like many long , painful moments until the time when I would rush toward him , find him leaning up against the side of the plastic hooded phone he 'd called from , looking blankly into a gutter as if he were watching water 's effluence , while leaning against the rail of a ship . <p> We were sailing nowhere . We were moving slowly . Hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else was there to go while Howie said over and over again , like a mantra , " I have n't slept with you for years , I have n't slept with you for so many years , there could n't possibly be a problem . I have n't slept with you . . " Of course , people overheard him , and looked after us as we wove down the street , Howie shaking , me trying to steer him and shush him at the same time , Howie saying through chattering teeth : " I have n't slept with you ... " <p> An observation : people 's personal pain is just another box that will tumble from the back of the truck , spilling your possessions all over the street ; people 's contentment , even their happiness , is the orchid that once bloomed with such waxy perfection they forget it can become blighted ; special moments are the kite carried high by the breeze , when the same day , a plane caught in a downdraft of wind plunges to the ground . You 're lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed if your friends , however peculiar , remain loyal ; you 're admirable if the rug is pulled from underneath you , and you improvise a gawky dance . <p> That 's what I am thinking this morning , just a few weeks after our convertible ride , trying to keep my thoughts as abstract as possible , walking from the parking garage to the hospital , feeling sorry for Howie , because his white blood cell count has begun to sink alarmingly , sorry for myself because I am so little up for this ; and also sorry for the passengers of the USAir plane that crashed , for the orchid Howie sent me for my birthday that I threw out prematurely at the first signs of yellowing , for the moving men who gathered up what they could from a big box containing Howie 's pans and spine-bent books and broken crockery . He decided that if he was getting sicker , he did n't want to be a sick person in the city . And what was his solution but to rent a house close to mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about where he would relocate to get out of the cold . Alice VanVleet , either stupid or intent upon not confronting the specifics of Howie 's situation , was lobbying hard for Virgin Gorda . Even Howie found this amusing . " Does n't the woman know there 's no going back ? " he asked me . <p> Suddenly , there is a short , fat nurse running into the hospital ahead of me , pushing the up button of the elevator , doing an impatient little sidestep routine as she watches the control panel , then runs onto the elevator and rises to her floor as I stand next to her . Whatever floor she gets off at will inevitably be permeated by the cardboard and sugar smell of hospital kitchen-prepared tomato sauce . She gets off at 3 , and I continue on in the elevator , alone , to the fifth floor . <p> I 'm not expecting anything good when I exit the elevator , and naturally I also am not expecting to see Roman . He is there in the corridor , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag some woman Howie would n't know to his bedside . As I come off the elevator , I know it is Roman , even though his back is turned to me and his hair has grown quite long , pulled back in a spout of a ponytail . He is wearing corduroy pants and a jade-green shirt . <p> " He 's using the portable toilet , " Roman says , nodding toward the room 's closed door . <p> " Hello to you , too , " I say . <p> " Do n't be mean to me , " he says . " I just found out , from my mother . " <p> " Your mother ? In New York ? How did she know ? " <p> " She called him because he can always tell her what she 's missed on the Sunday crossword puzzle . The paramedics were there : ' <p> " I sent them , " I say , as if I feel the need to explain my place in all this . " He was so out of breath when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence . " <p> " They 've given him a transfusion , " Roman says . We both look at the closed door . <p> " Were you planning to be in the area , anyway ? A letter you sent got returned to me the other day . A letter to some woman . " He looks confused . As always , when he is confused by something , he looks much younger . <p> " Roman , " I say , " you put your name , in care of me , as the return address . " <p> " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " he says . <p> " Roman , what is the point of this ? " <p> " A letter from me to someone else was returned to you ? How is that possible ? " <p> It is on the tip of my tongue to say buried treasure , but I do n't . A woman and a teenage girl , looking grim , walk by , arm-in-arm . The elevator doors open again , and three more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her black patent leather purse in front of her , like a shield . A man with a limp walks behind her . Another woman , obviously dizzy with nervousness , walks crookedly to the window of the nurse 's station . <p> " Who is this letter to ? " he asks . At least this time there is a slight hint of doubt in his voice . He shifts his weight from one foot to the other , standing in the familiar way with his left hip thrown out and his right foot turned outward , an almost balletic position . <p> " Some woman . Some woman you probably picked up on the train , or wherever . Remember when the phone would ring , and you 'd say Just some woman ' if anyone expressed any curiosity ? " <p> " What is this ? " he says . " Your feminist sensibilities being offended ? " <p> " I just asked a straightforward question . Howie 's been going downhill for months now . Neither of us had any idea where you were , since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule . Excuse me for being curious about whether you were in the area to begin with . " <p> " I drove from Derry , New Hampshire ; ' he says . " That 's where I live now . " <p> I look at the dizzy woman hurrying by , mouthing something silently to herself . Howie 's move to be close to me I understand but what does Roman have in mind ? He has never liked the cold , and what can there be for him in Derry , New Hampshire ? <p> " Other than this disastrous news about Howie , how was your summer ? " he says . " You know , Other than that , Mrs. Lincoln- " ' <p> " Roman , forgive me , but after all that 's happened , I really ca n't stand here and be asked questions about whether I had a pleasant summer . " <p> " I always change things , " he says . " I 'm cursed with being a catalyst . I do n't expect you to be sympathetic , obviously- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think I expect enough , " he says , suddenly , quite seriously . " The way I see it , I 'm going with the flow , but it 's a mystery to me : other people see me as the one who 's in control . They look to me for answers . They try to make me into some sort of authority figure that I 'm not . You and Howie have always acted in collusion , like everything that happened between us so long ago was all my idea , something I coerced you into . Why was it all my doing ? Think about it . " He frowns at me . " She asked me if she was correct in assuming that he was attracted to her " <p> " What are you talking about ? " I say . <p> " My sister . Marielle , who stole your boyfriend . " <p> It surprises me , when he mentions it so blatantly . Somehow , I had been wondering about the envelope-the envelope which he addressed just as I said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking about the past . <p> " They 've cut me off , you know , " he says . <p> " I did n't know , because I have n't been in touch with anybody except Howie . " <p> " You 're living in Maine year-round now , are n't you ? " he says . " What does it matter ? " <p> " Just a question , " he says . " You know , like your asking whether I intended to be here , anyway . " <p> An orderly wheeling a patient on a gurney passes us , wearing a gray jumpsuit and moon-landing boots . A nurse comes up quickly behind him , then opens the door to the room next to Howie 's so he can push the patient in . <p> " Good , " Roman says , more to himself than to me . " Howie 's still got the room to himself . " <p> It is the first moment I remember that Roman can be kind , considerate . The person Howie and-amazingly-I once cared so much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hear myself ask . <p> " Ooooh , " he says , drawing it out , seeming to really be thinking . " My guess ? My bisexuality . He 's a pretty straight arrow for an artist , Danny . And of course she 's always been Little Miss Goody Two Shoes . If things do n't hit her in the face , she does n't care to see them . " <p> " Your sister did n't know anything about your life ? " <p> " Did n't , apparently , until I hit her in the face , in a manner of speaking . Took a guy with me when we went . . . this is going to kill you : the four of us went on a reggae cruise one night . Sailed out of Portsmouth . " <p> The orderly passes by , says , " How you doin ' ? " <p> " Good , thanks , " Roman says . <p> I offer a false smile , although he 's already passed by . I stare at the backs of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been inflated with an air hose . But this is certainly not the moon . Very few people , except for visitors leaving , are taking one giant step here . Everyone moves slowly , bent under the weight of their worry or grief . A woman holding on to an IV pole wheels it along , a needle centered in the side of her wrist , smiling apologetically as she passes . <p> " God , this is awful , " I say . <p> He drops his arm around my shoulder . I feel myself stiffen , then slump tiredly . Why had Roman been the one in charge ? Because he was better-looking than either of us . Because , embarrassing as it is to admit as a grown-up , the most beautiful person got to be the one in charge . It did n't hurt that he was the most charismatic , either , or that he had his own apartment . Because Howie and I had both been weak , in a way , smitten with beauty , and we 'd both wanted to be captivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what Roman had , just through osmosis . As if on cue , the minute I figure all that out , the red light above Howie 's door comes on . He is finished ; he is calling the nurse to help him back to bed . There is no nurse anvwhere in sight . <p> " You go , " I whisper , drawing back . It seems clear that Roman should be the one to help him off the toilet . I feel sure that would embarrass Howie less . <p> At the door , only three steps away , Roman stops . He turns . He says , " A couple of times I 've driven by your house . I was trying to get up the nerve to come in and apologize . I had a rehearsed speech-a pretty good one . And then one time I decided to rely on that old dependable charm , I felt like luck was with me that particular night . That our stars were aligned , or something . I got there , and there was a Jeep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the orderly says , passing by , as if he has n't greeted us before . <p> " So that stopped you , " I say , finishing his thought for him . <p> " Right . It stopped me . " <p> " I do have friends , " I say . <p> With that he nods , then turns and opens the door , starting the difficult but still no doubt familiar process of going toward his old friend Howie , turning his back on his old friend Janet . It is symbolic , I think , feeling sorry for myself . It is n't just a turned back , it is the back he 's turned before , more times than he should have . And that is when the unexpected image comes to mind : the three of us , in bed , twenty years before , a not-yet-sex-sated Roman turning toward Howie , his ass jutting into my groin as I push forward to curl against him , his vertebrae pronounced because of his thinness . Drugs were food , and sex was love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I used the tip of my nose like a finger , running it lightly up his spine , breathing in the smell of Right Guard and sweaty skin , which had been synonymous , at that time in my life , with actually inhaling freedom . <p> Later , after a slowly eaten dinner , we go to my house . The Jeep is parked in the driveway ; the neighbors ' daughter 's prized vehicle , which there is no place for in their two-car driveway . I do n't explain it . I pull a bottle of wine out of the old oak mailbox that functions as a wine rack . There are two bottles , and I take the better of them out , uncork it wordlessly , pour two glasses half full , push one glass closer to Roman . <p> " You 're careful , are n't you ? " I ask . <p> " About drinking ? " he says . <p> " No . About sex . " <p> He looks at me , genuinely surprised . " Yes , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is suddenly not only looking at me , but staring . Can he possibly , madly , mean his steady gaze to be a come-on ? <p> " Of course I 'm careful , and of course it 's no fun , " he says . <p> I lower my eyes , sure now that it 's not my imagination ; he has been holding open some possibility . Sex is n't fun ? He and I could have fun ? In my house , half-emptied of furniture , with absurd rugs thrown here and there with pug dogs woven into them , in this place that I meant to live in so happily with my lover , visiting with my dear friend and soul mate Howie when he was well , physically well , no nightmare disease hanging over anyone . . . in this context , today , now , Roman and I could fall into each other 's arms ? Uneasily , as I 've done before , I look around me because I sense some presence . Is it guilt creeping in , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ? Or do I still think the younger Roman is hovering somewhere , hidden like the wolf in the tree , the Roman whose ghost hangs over us both : a ghost that Roman ca n't exorcise any more than I can-that dynamic , seemingly fearless person that Roman used to be . <p> I get the letter . Along with letters to be answered and bills to be paid , it 's been in one of the cubbyholes of the mailbox . I hand it to him , and , again , he looks surprised . " Well , look at it carefully , " he says , finally . " It 's my handwriting on the address , but it 's Marielle who . . . why would she have done this ? She obviously filled in the return to be in care of you . Why would she do that ? " <p> " I thought they 'd cut you off , " I say . <p> " They have . I have n't seen them for months , since the boat ride . " He puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had it in my jacket pocket that night , I think . I remember now . She wore my jacket because it was cold once we got out on the water . That 's right ; she did . She even wore it home in the car . She must have thought she was doing me a favor by mailing the letter the next day , but she did n't know my address , because I 'd just moved to Derry . So she asked Danny what your address was , and he told her . " <p> " Sherlock Holmes , " I say , raising my wineglass in a toast . <p> " But why did n't she put her own address on it ? " <p> " You tell me , " I say . <p> " Maybe because she thinks about you a lot . She 's guilty , and it makes her preoccupied with you . " <p> " She thinks about me ? What does she think ? " <p> " I do n't know . She used to bring you into conversation all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you by talking about you . What do I know ? " <p> " Well , " I say , handing him the letter , " I hope you were n't expecting a quick reply . " <p> " Actually , she saved me from making a fool of myself . It was a pretty intemperate letter . I was angry because a woman I 'd been seeing- " <p> " Some woman , " I say jokingly , mocking myself as much as him . <p> " Yep . Some woman , indeed . Issued me an ultimatum-could have told her that would n't work , right ? - insisting I set a wedding date , or the relationship was over . I 'd never misled her about anything , and it set me off . I wrote her and told her I 'd been straight with her from the first-what was she doing , suddenly demanding things like that ? " <p> For a moment , I 'm too surprised to react . He was serious enough about the woman in Rhode Island that she thought he 'd marry her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might truly have indicated that was a possibility ? <p> " What did she say ? " I finally ask . <p> " You 're holding my letter , " he says . " She never got it . Maybe she 's so dumb she thinks I 'm still mulling it over . " <p> My thoughts are flooding : The buried treasure ; the buried treasure ... the skull and crossbones . The stereo equipment . Tapes by Astor Piazzola . But I ca n't mention those things . There 's no way I can contradict him without having to explain . Why is he making up such a detailed story ? Why tell me about the messy situation at all , if all he 's going to do is lie ? <p> " Open it , " I say . " It would be like old times . I could see what you sound like these days when somebody pushes your buttons . " <p> " It 's better forgotten , " he says . <p> " You wo n't open it ? You wo n't even read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then shrugs . He hands me the envelope . " Read them yourself , if you really want to , Janet . " <p> This is even more perplexing . The envelope is suddenly in my hand . When he hands it to me , though-when he gives me permission to open it-I realize instantly that whatever the psychic said had to have been mere invention . She was a charlatan , just as I 'd suspected . It is not a map ; it is an irate letter , telling a woman in Rhode Island that what she wants will never come about . The fortune-teller was another person , another thing , Howie put his trust in inadvisably . <p> I rip open the envelope . Then I get my next surprise . <p> Where I expected a letter , there is , instead , a map . On one corner , someone has drawn a tornado or , more likely , experienced some frustration getting ink to flow out of the pen . Just as the psychic said , there is a fairly detailed map , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top braced open , spilling from it not jewels and coins , but revealing stereo components and many tapes . In another drawing , a maze of streets leads to the chest . The streets are named , and arrows point the way . <p> Coming up beside me , Roman says , " What the hell is that ? " <p> " Buried treasure , " I say , at last . <p> " What the- " He grabs the piece of paper from my hand . " My God , she 's completely crazy . She really is completely crazy . What did Marielle do , steam it open ? " <p> If he were n't so earnest , I would n't even half believe him , but I do half believe him . I decide that there is at least a fifty-fifty chance that he thought it really was the letter he just described to me . <p> " Unbelievable ! " he says , pronouncing every syllable , staring at the piece of paper . " I knew Marielle did n't like her , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a letter that . . " <p> " What is it ? " I say , helpless now in my confusion . <p> " It 's what you said it was . It 's buried treasure , " he says . " It 's even got . . . look at the road names . She 's written the street names right on the page . She 's lost her fucking mind ! " <p> I sit on a kitchen stool , frowning . <p> " Somebody broke into Deirdre 's apartment one weekend when we were away . They-Jesus ! - there 's no they about it . My insane sister did it . She took her stereo and hid it in the woods , obviously , and then , on top of that , later she steals my letter and sends Deirdre a map showing her where the stuff is , and naturally , since it 's in my handwriting , what would Deirdre think but that I was responsible . That I put somebody up to the break-in . My God ! What if this had n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . It does seem bizarrely malicious . Also , he does seem incredibly lucky . But more than that , I see that for the millionth , billionth time , I 'm involved in his life again , helpless and awed by the madness , fascinated but repelled . Roman becomes Pac Man , eating up time . That 's what he 's like ; he 's like Howie 's game of Pac Man , a little figure racing around the screen , voracious , wildly energized , everything magnetized by his megalomania . It 's just another moment in Roman 's life , in which so many colleagues are jealous of his brilliance there 's always a movement afoot to get him fired , but this time-this time it 's his own sister who 's tried to do him in . Earlier , in the hospital , Roman was onto something . He sensed something similar to what I 'm thinking now ; he was on the track of himself , when he made the remark about being a catalyst . I take a deep breath , wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the way he lives that he invites these things . Yeah , sure , he finds people who are complicit , but since I 've been one of those people , I 've developed a lot of sympathy . You stand at the shore , wading in gradually , and suddenly there 's a tidal wave , an undertow , Roman arranges it so there 's no lifeguard but him , and when you finally escape-grateful to him ; always grateful to the savior-your metabolism is set a little higher , those endorphins have been set loose , the next day , you need the next high . The beach was just a mirage , though . You look everywhere for where you were , but it is n't there , or never was . But Roman is there . So you attach yourself to Roman , to the great magnet who pulls you slowly in . <p> So how did I lose my charge ? I wonder now . How did I ever escape to the extent that I did , and what is it that made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiances ? Because of all the time I spent with Danny , before Roman found a way to intervene ? Or because I 'd opted for true friendship years before-because it quickly became obvious that I liked Howie better : reliable , unglamorous Howie . That conclusion must have hurt Roman , but the more I drifted , the weaker his pull became , so that all he could do was stay in close proximity . Let me see what being a loser in love was like . Let me experience loneliness . Wait until illness threatened to take my best friend away . See if that did n't make me go running back to his side . And he is now to be found in New Hampshire , a state conveniently adjacent to Maine . <p> " I 'm afraid of her , " he says . " I 'll be honest with you . I 'm too freaked out to go home tonight . I 'm afraid I 'd call my sister and say some very , very regrettable things to her . You 've got to protect me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay calm . She 's stark raving mad-you see that , Janet , do n't you ? I 've got to figure out the best way to deal with this : ' <p> The guest room , the one painted blue , has always been referred to-because he always chose to sleep there , those rare occasions he was without a girlfriend he wanted to screw all night in the quiet of the trailer-as " Roman 's Room . " He is telling me now that he must spend the night there-the first time he 'll have been in the house overnight since Danny left . <p> " You know what , Roman ? " I say . " All the time you 've been talking , I 've been thinking the most terrible things about you . " <p> " When have you not ? " he says , taking my hand . " When , ever , have you not ? " <p> Sitting in the red Jeep in my driveway , late that night , I relive it : the time Roman arrived with Howie , bringing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't determine the weather , but how fortuitous-how fortuitous the facts of Roman 's life have so often been : the sky flashing bright with lightning , trees dropping like pick-up-sticks in the gusting wind , candles lit as the power went out , the panes of glass shaking in the old windows in need of reglazing . That unremitting , wild weather that always leads people to band together to resist nature with all their strength . <p> I meant to stay safe inside . While Howie and Roman and Danny took silly chances , chasing after ambulances and fire trucks on foot , going to inspect huge fallen oaks with power lines tangled like deadly IV tubes through them , Danny-so I 'm toldstripped and jumped in the river , laughing and bobbing crazily as spiky waves lashed him . So much physicality must have come as a relief . In spite of his cynicism about life in general , Howie always retained his schoolboy crush on Roman . He must have suffered when he faded into and out of Roman 's affections , even as a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women over men , but that those women were most often such small , pale , compliant creatures . The parade of women was like a parody of the two of us ; they 'd inevitably have little energy , little to say , they 'd seem , perhaps , only to have one hidden agenda , and that would be their desire to marry Roman . Then , if any got close enough , he 'd tell them our history , and if that did n't work , he 'd repel them by going to a bar and dancing , or flirting , with men . <p> Sometimes I fixate on the night of the hurricane , and this is turning out to be one of those times . The neighbors ' daughter did n't have a red Jeep then , she had a different car that I let her keep parked in my driveway , a banged-up Buick that was painted a nondescript brown . She 'd given it the nickname " The Mudmobile . " Although I was alone the day after the hurricane hit , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so many large , substantial trees had been uprooted ; the snarled power cables were dangerous snakes of electric current coiling through the maples and elms ; more wind than I expected blew up around me , forcing tears from my eyes , so that after a few minutes of standing and staring , I took shelter in the driver 's seat of the Buick . While I was sitting there-a silly sight ; a driver going nowhere , I reflected even at the time-mulling over the first dramatic arrival of Roman in Maine , accompanied by his amazing singing tiger , Howie ( truly , he had introduced Howie to Danny this way , casting himself as the person who cracked the whip , and at the same time making fun of the tiger-striped scarf Howie wore around his neck ) - well : it was Howie who was my friend , and , however unadvisedly , he had brought Roman , but the way Roman presented it , he was running the show , Howie was just one of the acts . I was n't even on the billing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about that , thinking about Roman 's unkindness toward Howie , envisioning a circus-a real circus , Barnum and Bailey-remembering how excited I had been as a small child to be seated with my mother at ringside , when suddenly , or maybe not so suddenly , because my eyes had been closed , and I had been in another world , there was a tap on the car , and I jumped with alarm . Frightened myself , I had also frightened the person who 'd done the tapping : Roman 's girlfriend of the moment , Angie . I rolled down the window . <p> " The men are all off inspecting the damage , are n't they ? " she said . <p> " Yes , " I said , " Right . " Flustered . Embarrassed to have been so lost in thought that I 'd been easily frightened . <p> " I know you 're his best friend , " Angie said . " I hope it does n't put you on the spot if I ask you a question . " <p> " Whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked at me a little strangely . Then-I should have thought to offer-she walked around to the passenger 's side and opened the car and got in . " Roman 's , " she said , pulling the door shut with a click so delicate I was n't sure the door was closed . She was a sweet , gentle girl . She found it difficult to make eye contact . " I know you 've known each other since you were eighteen . He says you 're the only person he totally trusts . " <p> " I did n't see Roman for quite a long time , " I said . " For quite a while after I got together with Danny , I found I really did not have any desire to see Roman . " <p> " Ms. Peacham , " she said . " What are you doing in the car ? " <p> " Is that the question ? " <p> " No , " she said . " But what are you ? " <p> " I wanted to get out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for me . So I thought I 'd sit in the car for a minute . " <p> " The trailer 's sunk in the mud , " she said . " Roman says it 's going to have to be pulled out with a tractor . " <p> We both looked at it , through the car 's streaked windows , lopsided and glowing . I remember thinking that we inherited such odd things . I was looking at a trailer , on a triangle of land across from my house in Maine . Inside were plants . Gesnariads . The caretaker who 'd lived there-or more likely his wife-had grown them under grow-lights clipped to pole lamps and window ledges . They were almost all dead when NV bought the house , and I started trying to nurse them back to health . I had the sudden thought that Angie might think the plants were mine . That I had no better idea of how to care for plants . It seemed important to tell her that certain things had just befallen me . I was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , meet my eyes as she turned toward me in the seat . She was in her early twenties , but she could have passed for a teenager , her face bare of makeup , her eyes startlingly large and quite lovely without it . She looked a little the way I 'd looked when I was her age , but she had real natural beauty . <p> " I do n't think he loves me , do you ? " she said . <p> After quite a long pause , I said : " No . I do n't think he does . " <p> She swallowed . " Is it because he loves you ? " <p> " No , " I said . I said it instantly , reflexively , though I 'd been taken aback by her question . " You know when a person loves you . Roman has never loved me : ' <p> " Did you ever feel the way I do ? " she said . " I mean , did you ever want him to ? " <p> I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Roman is our friend , but I think Howie and I both were worn down into friendship . He 's very demanding , as I 'm sure you 've noticed . There 's a real bond , but it 's not friendship , exactly , and it 's not love , either . To the extent that he cares about anybody , he cares about me and Howie , but he does n't love either of us , and he never did . " <p> The information registered , I saw . <p> " Does he always set women up ? Want to fight with them , I mean . " She was biting her bottom lip , her eyes averted , her flaxen hair falling forward , nearly obscuring her face . <p> " Women , in particular ? I 've never thought about it . I think he just likes to be provocative . He prefers to be the center of attention : ' <p> " Is this what your life is like ? " she said . Her voice was almost a whisper . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give her that morning , along with a pile of other clean clothes , as he was returning to the trailer after having his breakfast and coffee . <p> It was an excellent question : Was it ? A person sitting in her driveway , world torn up around her , power out , food in the refrigerator spoiled , an odd hostess hostessing an odd party , taking time out from the talk and the games and the " remember when 's " that would continue for many more nights , amid burning candles , in the aftermath of a storm . <p> " You could leave , " she said . " Could n't you leave ? " Not so long after that , it was Danny who left . Intermittently , Roman and Howie arrived , and then departed . Now Howie may either be in residence full-time , or , if he 's unlucky , he may never be in the house again . And Roman . Right now , Roman sleeps in Roman 's Room . <p> The girl , though , is long gone-someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed , in the moment , to pass off as a rhetorical question . For our own reasons , that day , because of Roman , and also because so much of what she and I wanted to believe in had been uprooted , toppled like big trees in the storm , our levels of unhappiness had risen to the same level at the same time . When she slipped her hand in mine , it was as if we were momentarily powerful , contiguous . It was as if we were one great river , not separate bodies holding their own courses . <p>
