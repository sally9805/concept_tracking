When i arrived at gator 's house to help with the stove , he was just shooting my baby son in the forehead . I set the brake on my tracker and stepped out onto the leafy gravel . Gator kicked the corpse , which was wriggling there on the lake bank . <p> " Yup , it 's yours all right , " he shouted up the hill , clearly displeased with me . " Look at the eyes  --  and the spread of the forehead , how the eyebrows are formed ? Looks like your boy Matthew five years ago . " <p> I told my boy Matthew to stay in the back compartment of the tracker , and I hopped down a dozen railroad ties that had been set into the hillside . I tried not to trounce the wildflowers and herbs in the stair-step planting beds . <p> It was hard to say at first glance  --  that distracting bullet hole an inch above the bridge of the nose , the flesh already starting to crack and ooze a sickly green . But Gator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . But this rapidly disintegrating form had the classic Stohler blond-haired , blue-eyed baby features . <p> Gator worked unnecessarily at the bill of his Chicago Cubs hat , wrenching his white locks back and forth . " You was here overnight two weeks ago when I moved in . I tolt you and tolt you again not to go near the lake . Especially not to put anything into it . Particularly nothing with a DNA pattern to it . What 'd you do ? March straight to the end of the dock and flog yet dolphin ? " <p> I could feel my face glowing red . " No . Did n't go anywhere near the lake . You know I 'm wary of chemical reservoirs . " <p> And then , with my denial so flatly stated , I paused to think about it . Had I gone near the lake ? Five of us from the office had spent the day moving Gator into his new retirement home . Hauling boxes , heaving furniture . We 'd only destroyed a lamp and a vase . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hauled out two frosty cases of Bass ale . <p> " Ah , " I said . " I do remember something about stumbling out and taking a leak on the compost pile . " <p> The compost bins were a neat arrangement of two-by-fours and hardware cloth . They had been left behind by the previous owner of the cottage . Two of the bins were half full of rotting muck . <p> Gator snorted . " They 's five feet from the water 's edge , an ' you go pissin ' in the compost . Piss could easily seep five feet . " <p> " Sounded like a good idea at the time  --  help the decomposition along . You think urine carries your DNA ? " <p> Gator shook his head , amazed that I 'd had to ask . <p> " I 'd hate to lose the house , " Gator said . " Lease contract was pretty specific that the lake was purely an ' aesthetic asset . ' Thass what they called it . Even made me buy an air-seal bubble top for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease now if it wanted . They do n't like letting their imaging compound get all depleted like this  --  just ' cause some ale-belly could n't find the bathroom . " <p> " Hold on , " I said . " The road atlas that my tracker subscribes to says this lake 's only a two-three security level , like you could go skiing on it or something . " <p> " Two-point-three may be the government rating , yeah , but the utility what owns it says not to go near it , and there ai n't one of my neighbors who does n't have that written into his lease . " <p> " Sounds like a lot of trouble , this lake . " <p> " On the programmer 's salary we made , " Gator said , " I imagine you 're gon na get a house on a lake of pure water ? The kind you can go skinny-dipping in  --  trolling for snapping turtles . Hah . " <p> The baby corpse had now degenerated into a green puddle of slime oozing back toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to check out your stove , " I reminded Gator . I hoped to divert his attention away from this embarrassing business  --  the lake borrowing my DNA pattern and belch forth little replicas . Imaging compounds are pretty volatile like that . <p> Gator peered into the lake . He edged farther down the bank , his boots tearing at the grass , until he came to rest atop the rim of the non-porous concrete that covered the lake bottom . <p> " There , " he said , pointing with his 9mm automatic , " there 's another one comin ' . They do n't develop on any schedule I can figure , but they average about two an hour . I pick ' em off quick as I can  --  those chemicals they drag around , they 're hell on the grass and shrubbery . " <p> A pink dome the size of a grapefruit was rising through the murk of the lake , another little Stohler monster coming to meet Papa . <p> Gator fired , and the little dome cracked open before it even broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gator said . " They are n't human . Are n't even animal . Just some mindless biochem . . . perversion . This is one of them compounds that the imaging utilities got ta keep in such big supply . " <p> " How long will this go on ? " It was a cool day , but I was beginning to sweat . <p> Gator shrugged . " Could be days , even a week . Maybe just until some other DNA comes along . Whatever  --  I bought several cases of ammo today . " <p> I got Matthew out of the tracker and took him inside by the roadside door , avoiding the lakefront . It would take me a while to formulate an explanation for the gunplay . <p> Inside , Matthew 's blue eyes shot open at the sight of Gator 's television set . The little guy could quote the specs of any of the latest sim/stim enhancements , and Gator 's new rig had all the bells and whistles . A strip of chrome molding was emblazoned with the motto " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rallying cry of the photonic industry . <p> Without even asking , Matthew was punching at the startup keypad and then rolling through the channel grid until he found a cezanne concert on the West Coast . <p> The pod 's ferroplex door popped open . From my viewpoint the holovids were a little fuzzy and distorted . But Matthew 's arms fell to his side and gyrated in small circles , the way they do when he 's in the thrall of his favorite photonic devices . He flashed his wide eyes in my direction , as if he were simultaneously asking and receiving permission to go ahead , and then he climbed inside and eagerly settled into the seat . <p> As I pushed the door closed around him , the holos inside came into appropriate focus  --  an amphitheater of cezanne enthusiasts bobbing their heads and waggling their feet to those incomprehensible rhythms that the devotees find hypnotizing . <p> " See ya in an hour or two , Matthew , " I said , and I pressed the door until the latch clicked . <p> Gator was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing I would want to inspect it right away . <p> " The delivery men set that TV up for me , " he said . " I hai n't even gotten around to reading the manual yet , and Matthew there seems to know it the way he knows his own pud . You 're such a cook , maybe you know stoves like Matthew knows TVs ? " <p> " I told you on the phone , " I said , " that I 'm no expert with kitchen appliances . No guarantees , okay ? " <p> " Much time as you spend in kitchens , " he hulled , " ya ought ta know something about ' em . This is my first PIXI , ya know . Elma and me , we always had a pure electronic kitchen  --  much as we could still find parts for . Guess I 'd always had it in mind that I 'd be dead before electronic appliances were totally phased out . Humph . " <p> Like the new television , this PIXI stove was the latest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , familiar appliances , leaving Gator to refurnish it via a broker over long distance . Gator had been too distracted with the move  --  and , typically , too impatient  --  to get very specific with the broker . As a result he had wound up with the most expensive in everything . <p> The top of the stove had that unsettling , undulating finish that was characteristic of many PIXI devices . It was aqua-green , looking like a square slice of a miniature Atlantic Ocean . On the selector panel the cook could punch up the specifications of the burner he wanted , and the Photonic Imaging Xenon Interface would instantly assemble that burner in the requested size , shape , and temperature . <p> Gator shuffled up behind me and we stared at the selector panel . <p> " Looks pretty standard to me , Gator . " <p> " Ta me , looks like the control board for a lunar shuttle , " he replied . <p> I punched up the specs for a routine burner  --  round , six inches across , 500 degrees F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An illuminated rocker switch allowed temperature adjustments . " Humph , " Gator said . <p> I went to the refrigerator and found a couple of boned chicken breasts , then opened the pantry and selected two ripe tomatoes . Then back to the refrigerator for a bottle of ale , which I opened . <p> " What are ya doin ' ? " Gator asked . <p> There was a suitable skillet hanging on a peg by the kitchen window , and I drew a butcher knife out of the storage black . <p> " I need garlic , " I said , " fresh if you have it . And let me see  --  was that basil I saw growing in one of those little garden beds outside ? " <p> " I do n't get it , " Gator said , removing his Cubs hat . <p> " There 's not much to get . The stove 's working fine , and I 'm gon na make dinner . " <p> Gator went outside to snip some basil and shoot a couple of babies that were chewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light the next morning . Geese were honking in the distance . They would not be settling on the lake , however . No fowl would last long paddling around a lake that was hungry for DNA , even if it got through the laser fencing that domed the reservoir . Geese learn these things quickly . <p> Matthew rolled over in his cot and drew the corner of his quilt up over his head against the chill . He usually slept long and hard after such an extensive session with the holovids . <p> I tiptoed out of the bedroom and up to the kitchen level . I glanced down through the front windows into the yard , just to satisfy my curiosity . I had imagined that a full herd of babies might have groped its way onto the lawn during the night , but Gator had assured me that they only materialize during daylight . Something to do with photosynthesis . <p> I poured beans into the espresso machine , which growled and dribbled its thick fluid into a cup . <p> I snapped the seals on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whipped them together with a fork . Chopped a couple scallions , diced some Swiss cheese . Peeled several strips of bacon out of the vacuum bin . <p> Then I got the skillet down again and took it and the bowl over to the gleaming new stove . I hit the " repeat " button to produce the same burner configuration that had been last requested . No response . <p> Damn . <p> I poked in the specs again : round , six inches , 500 degrees F. No response . <p> I asked for a five-inch burner . Nothing . <p> I ordered a nine-inch burner . Nope . <p> Then , just because I was steamed , I poked in specs for a thirty-six-inch burner  --  which dutifully materialized , every square centimeter of it at precisely 500 degrees . Suddenly the kitchen was a sauna . <p> I poked the " off " button , and the colossal burner vanished . <p> I turned on the vidphone and scrolled down to the number for PIXICO . A stern-looking woman appeared on the screen . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hair . ( Is this some rural fashion , I wondered , or is this just so with-it that I had n't yet heard of it ? ) <p> " The offices of the Photonic Imaging Xenon Interface Company are currently closed , " the woman intoned . A recording . " Saturday hours are eleven a.m. to four p.m . " <p> I poured the beaten eggs back into their original shells , milk and all , and snapped them closed  --  they would keep for a few hours that way in the refrigerator . <p> The espresso was done , so I poured a cup and tapped a few grains of sugar into it . <p> Matthew was stirring downstairs and Gator was down the hall now , breaking wind in the bathroom . Maybe I could make French toast in the oven , I thought , or maybe we should just eat cereal . <p> I went out onto the deck , the warm cup cradled in my hands . The air had that autumn bite to it . I slouched into a rail-side sling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake 's edge where , I supposed , the bio-chem babies would begin emerging again soon . <p> Gator padded out onto the fiberboard decking , naked but for a T-shirt . He jammed a fresh clip into his 9mm and rested his hands on the rail while he took aim at the bank . Without the Cubs cap , his hair was a wild snowstorm , thinner than I had remembered . <p> " You 've lost yet Matthew , ya know , " Gator said . <p> " Huh ? " I said with a start . " What ? " <p> It seemed like such a vile thing to hear from a man who was preparing to slaughter my simulated offspring . <p> " The TV , " Gator said . " I just saw Matthew closing himself in again . Asked him if he did n't want breakfast , Looked at me like I was nuts . " <p> " Just as well , " I said , sipping at the espresso . " I 'm , um , having trouble with the stove . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a satellite dish . Ca n't get a live human at PIXICO till eleven . " <p> " So there is somethin ' wrong with the stove . " <p> I nodded . <p> " Thought you had all sorts of friends at the utility . " <p> " I know one guy , " I said , " a mid-level graphic artist at the Philadelphia office . I doubt he even knows who handles service out here . " <p> " Ah , " Gator replied , and he squeezed the trigger . <p> The surprise of the blast threw my hands up and the espresso sloshed into my lap . <p> " Damn ! " I said . <p> " Damn ! " said Gator , and he fired again . <p> On the crest of the lake bank a fleshy little figured collapsed from the impact of the second shot and rolled down the hill . <p> Gator stood erect again , satisfied . His penis had shrunk up in the cold , pushing the bottom of his T-shirt up into a tent shape . He read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stohler . " <p> Matthew was still encased in the TV at eleven a.m . Through the ferroplex I glimpsed a holovid of an asteroid cowboy darting about in his shepherd pod . The show was probably a harmless enough space opera . <p> I poked at the dial pad on the holophone and got a picture of old Bone-Hair again . <p> " Photonic Imaging Xenon Interface , " she said grimly . She awaited a reply . This , apparently , was a live image . <p> From outside came the crack of Gator 's 9mm . <p> " I 'm at my friend 's house , " I said into the holophone , " having trouble with the stove . " <p> Ms. Bone-Hair referred to the readout just above the phone camera . " You 're on our North Twin Reservoir , " she said . It sounded like an accusation . <p> " That 's right . My friend Gator  --  um , Martin Brown is his real name  --  just moved in . Got a brand new PIXI stove , one of those high-end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could  --  but I 'm having trouble too . " " What exactly were you trying to achieve , Mr.  --  " <p> " Um , I just wanted a standard-size burner for an omelette . " <p> Ms. Bone-Hair tapped her key pad and watched the read-out . <p> " And what time of day might that have been ? " she asked . <p> " Just a couple hours ago , " I said . <p> She snorted . " Saturday morning eight , nine a.m. ? Why , that 's prime imaging time , sir . PIXICO 's imaging reserves are bound to be rather strained at that time of day  --  does n't it stand to reason ? Particularly for stovetop burners . " <p> " But it allowed me to call up a burner the size of a bath tub , " I replied . <p> " Have you read your operator 's manual , Mr. Brown ? " <p> " Brown is my friend 's name . It 's his house . " <p> " The larger burners are restaurant-gauge . The owner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound , one with a sturdier molecular structure . Of course , the imaging is more costly and that will show up on your bill . But the supply is usually less strained . If you must cook at peak hours , perhaps you should use the larger burner . " <p> " Yeah , " I said , " next time I want to peel the paint off the ceiling at the same time . Look , I use PIXI stoves all the time where I come from , and I 've never heard of a low supply of imaging compound . " <p> " And where would it be that you 're from. ? " <p> " Philadelphia . " <p> Gator shouldered in front of me  --  pretty rude from a holophone etiquette standpoint . " I 'd just as soon have a stove installed like the old one , " he said to Ms. Bone-Hair . <p> " But that would be an electric stove , " she sniffed , her tone implying all of the dreadful qualities that electric appliances brought to the modern mind  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " Gator said , " an ' it had four burners , always available . " <p> " Well , in summation , gentlemen , " said Bone-Hair , " I recommend that you avoid peak hours , read the owner 's manual , and  --  please  --  remember that you are a hunnerd and twenty miles from Philadelphia . So , on to the next customer ! " She smiled and the holo screen went blank . <p> My chrono said it was a little after eleven a.m . I poked at the control pad of the PIXI stove , and a common nine-inch burner materialized . <p> I shrugged and turned it off again . <p> Gator shrugged too . " Avoid peak hours , " he mimicked . " I wonder how that lady 'd like a pistol up her butt ? So hey , what are ya gon na do ? " <p> " I guess I 'm going to make an omelette . " <p> " No , " Gator said , " I mean about the stove . " <p> " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 've moved to a place that 's a hundred twenty miles from Philadelphia . To the edge of a lake of imaging compound where the population density is , by law , almost nil  --  and the photonic utility is probably run by corn farmers . " <p> Gator looked hurt . Or maybe he was just suddenly worried that his new cottage was not nearly the idyllic retirement hideaway that he had once thought . <p> " Sorry , Stohler , " he mumbled . " Guess I was expecting too much . Guess I was remembering about how you used to talk  --  about knowing people who knew other people who knew how to bend the rules sometimes . " <p> Out of the corner of my eye I caught a glimpse of a small figure down in the living room silhouetted against the picture window . Matthew . He appeared to have each palm , and his nose , pressed to the glass . <p> I went down the steps . <p> " Tired of holovision already ? " I asked . <p> Matthew turned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight shadowing his face , but his eyes seemed to have receded into dark hollows . He seemed uncharacteristically tentative . He seemed gawd-awful sick . <p> " Daddy , " he asked , " is there something wrong with the lake ? " oh , damn . Gator had just been outside hunting babies , and maybe Matthew saw something that will scar him for life . Why does n't he crawl back into the TV for a few more hours ? <p> " No , Matthew , " I told him calmly . " The lake 's just fine . See ? Is n't it a pretty lake ? " <p> " There are n't any geese , " he said sternly . <p> " Ah . Geese . Well , that 's storybook stuff , my man . In the storybooks you have geese paddling around on the water . But this is n't that kind of lake . " <p> He looked pathetic  --  little Oshkosh overalls hanging limply around him . I figured I 'd better get some food into him . <p> " But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , it 's an okay lake then ? " <p> " Definitely , " I said , taking his hand and leading him toward the stairs to the kitchen . " Yes , definitely . " <p> " Good , " he said , " the pixies will be glad to hear it . " <p> We arrived on the kitchen level . Gator was cleaning his pistol and reloading several of his seventeen-round clips . <p> " Pixies  --  like you 've been talking to Tinkerbell ? " I asked . <p> " Tinkerbell is for pussies , Dad , " he said . <p> Gator raised one eyebrow into an arch that said , " Where 'd a five-year-old learn that kind of language ? " <p> And then I had an alarming thought , which begat more and more alarming thoughts . <p> " Matthew , " I said slowly , " these people you 're been talking to  --  did you call them pixies because they 're from the utility ? From PIXICO ? " <p> Matthew blinked innocently . " No , Daddy , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " is your holovision interactive ? " <p> Gator slapped a clip into place . " Tell ya the truth , I 've barely had it on . Knowin ' how to interact might come natural to Matthew . But I 'm the one has n't even figured the stove yet . " <p> " The utility ? " little Matthew asked , eyes widening with horror . " Will I have to pay a bill then ? " <p> Matthew ate half of an omelette and with very little resistance went to bed for what I hoped would be a long nap . Gator was getting fidgety . <p> " Calm down , " I said . " You get in a shouting match with that Bone-Hair lady  --  threaten her or something  --  and you 'll lose the house altogether . PIXICO will toss your ass out on County Road 814  --  and your new stove and TV right after you . " <p> " Well , they already suspect something 's wrong with the lake , so what 's wrong with a little photonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one ought a be tootin ' steam out his ass ! They were trying to use your son , dammit  --  a five-year-old  --  to check up on their fucking lake of imaging compound ! This ai n't a retirement house  --  it 's a photonic prison ! " <p> I rolled my eyes at the exaggeration and punched a number on the holophone . A crazy , animated sequence rose on the screen  --  a parade of tiny turkeys in little yellow rain hats emerging from a sleeping man 's nostrils . <p> " This is Osborne , all right , " I said . <p> Gator looked skeptical . <p> " Oh , I have n't called him in a while , but Osborne would create a greeting like this , " I said . <p> When the turkeys were done with their dance , a large Navajo appeared on the screen . He was hunched forward to see his own holo screen , giving us a close-up of his stylishly ragged haircut . Behind him was a wall full of animation decks and editing monitors . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in the graphics department ? Looks like PIXICO is n't giving you enough to do in Philadelphia . " <p> Osborne snorted . " If I had known it was you calling Stohler , I would have run out a different greeting . I have a new one called the Butt Brothers Ballet . Want to see it ? " <p> " Love to , but I got no time , " I said . " I need to run a problem past you . " As I told him the story of Bone-Hair , scowl . <p> " This friend of yours  --  Gator ? " Osborne asked . " This is the one you 've been telling me about for years ? The one that 's got an instinct for fucking with people . And attracting people that wan na luck with him . " <p> " I just need some advice , Osborne . " <p> He grunted . " Look , you 've got this rural outfit out there . Technically , legally , it 's a separate company  --  anti-trust laws , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . The management styles of these little sideshows can get pretty wild . In Philly , ya know , we keep the imaging compounds in underground tanks . Those substances are too sensitive to have civilians crawling around them . " <p> " Gator 's here because of the scenery , " I said . " And  --  hell  --  it is a beautiful view . " <p> Osborne grunted again . When he stretched , his face rose out of sight . He hunched down again , looking weary . <p> " Sounds like your cow-chippin ' utility is running close to the bone on its budget , " Osborne said . " Otherwise they would n't lease cottages on the banks of an imaging compound reservoir . And they would n't go gullybonkers over a small herd of slime-babies . That would be a relatively small drain on their imaging power , ya know , unless they have barely enough imaging reserves to service their customers  --  " <p> The holo image of Osborne collapsed into a roiling field of wild geometric shapes . A new image materialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm so sorry , " she sniffed , " but transmissions contrary to the interests of PIXICO are strictly prohibited . You will find in paragraph thirty-two of the user contract that  --  " <p> The sharp whack of a pistol shot tossed my heart up into my throat . I turned to find Gator wearing a satisfied grin , lowering his automatic . The phone 's holo screen was collapsing into a little mound of crystal junk . <p> " Got the snooping bitch , " Gator said . <p> " What you got was your own holophone , " I said . <p> Gator squinted . " I 'm tired , " he said , as if that explained it all . <p> The surface of the stove erupted into a fiery replica of Bone-Hair . About her head was a bouffant of wild blue flame . Her eyes were glowing coals . She swatted at me with searing white fingertips , singeing my shin at the shoulder . With the other hand she snatched the 9mm out of Gator 's hands . <p> I dodged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closet . <p> Dangerous as she was , Bone-Hair seemed to be sunk waist-deep in the stovetop and stuck that way . Thank gawd for what limits there were to photonic imaging . <p> The kitchen curtains were turning brown . In a moment they would burst into flame . The countertops were blistering from the heat . Bone-Hair flailed maniacally , flinging melted gunmetal around the kitchen . She opened her mouth and rattled my ears with demented keening . <p> Gator emerged from the closet , his jaw set with determination . In fluid motions he hoisted an axe onto his shoulder and charged at the blazing specter that had taken over his kitchen . The axe sliced easily through the fire monster and glanced off the surface of the stove . <p> " To hell with her , " I shouted . " Take a whack at the photonics ! The control panel ! " <p> Gator hoisted the axe again . Bone-Hair effortlessly re-formed herself , swiped at his face , and etched four sickly brown welts across his jaw  --  one for each finger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair on the right side of his head had been scorched away . The curtains whooshed into flame . Gator 's axe arced through the air and struck the control panel . The ferroplex cracked , but Bone-Hair was unfazed . <p> The blazing creature clutched the axe blade with one paw and grabbed Gator 's wrist with the other . Gator howled as the stench of burning flesh filled the kitchen . <p> I heaved a kitchen chair at Bone-Hair , but she swat ted i t aside as if i t were no more than a dragonfly . Gator 's hand fell to the stovetop with a sizzling splash , the wrist burned through . Bone-Hair opened her mouth into an inhuman gape and bit into his neck . <p> Gator 's jaw opened silently , and his eyes rolled in my direction  --  a dead stare . The fire beast yanked Gator 's torso up onto the stovetop , where it crackled like bacon . <p> Bone-Hair 's fiery features died down suddenly , as if she were placated by death . She shrank to standard human proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her blazing skin and hair faded to normal tones . She folded her hands demurely and regarded me  --  a dumbstruck guest in a burning kitchen , watching rivulets of Gator 's sputtering blood pour down the side of the stove . <p> " Well , " she said primly , " you ca n't do that with electricity ! " <p> Even if I 'd had something to say I would not have been capable . I backed away warily and found the stairs . <p> " I will have to file a report , you know , " she said , oblivious to the gut-wrenching smoke that nearly concealed her image now . " It may be that you share some liability for damage to PIXICO property . May I have your name , please ? " <p> On the lower level I found the television pod , and through the ferroplex I could see little Matthew 's blond head . Oh , gawd . Bone-Hair had me by the balls . If she could project herself through something as rudimentary as a stovetop , she would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I strode across the room and yanked at the door .

" But please come out of there right away . Um , we have to leave now . " <p> Matthew shrugged , swiveled out of the seat , and stepped out onto the floor . I realized then that the holo screen surrounding him was blank . The entire pod interior seemed mute , lifeless . <p> " Why did n't you have it on , Matt ? " <p> " I was just looking at the sentia deck , " he said . " Gator said I could n't watch TV anymore . Said those pixies were n't good . " <p> " So you obeyed ?

And the downstairs holophone unit hummed . I could smell smoke from the kitchen now . <p> I took Matthew 's hand and tugged him toward the downstairs door . <p> " It 's rude not to answer the phone , " Matt said . <p> " Yeah , " I said , " this is all pretty male . " <p> Down near the take , two babies were butting their heads against the two-by-four framing of the compost bin . Trying to return to the womb , I imagined . <p> Matthew saw them , of course , and pointed . <p> " Just some of the local wildlife , " I explained . " I 'll tell you about it later . " Later , I hoped , I would have made up a better story . <p> When I let Matthew into the back compartment of the Arisawa tracker he listlessly fired up the holo unit . It was a special installation , several notches above the factory rigs , but still a poor substitute for Gator 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and noticed that smoke was starting to seep out from the frame of the kitchen window . <p> I reviewed the tracker 's mapping unit and retraced the several twists and turns that had led me to Gator 's hideaway among the cornfields of southeastern Pennsylvania . The first commercial structure we encountered bore the sign " Yoder 's Trading Store , " and I pulled into the gravel lot . <p> " Look , Matthew  --  an Amish store . " <p> Matthew did not look up , absorbed as he was in a surreal swirl of pineapples and chartreuse amoebas . I popped the tracker door open , hoping to find something inside to drink during the drive home . <p> The other three vehicles outside the store were obviously Amish - patched together relics from the era of the internal combustion engine . The Amish sect in this vicinity , anyway , allowed its members to embrace several castoff technologies  --  among them gasoline-powered autos and electricity . The next county over , who knows ? The Amish there could still be in the horse-and-buggy days . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cobbled together from several different models . The body was a checkerboard of blue and green , layered over with mud and rest . It had once had a flat bed , but now a wooden frame held dozens of chickens in stacked cages on each side of the truck . The interior of the truck bed housed a small herd of pigs . The truck reeked of fresh manure . <p> Forgetting about my thirst , I returned to the driver 's seat . About fifty yards down the road , I found a dirt turn-off and parked there . <p> " I need you to stay here by yourself for just a few minutes , " I said to Matthew . <p> He looked up from the back compartment and for a fraction of a second our eyes locked and he nodded . Sometimes that 's all the acknowledgment I can hope for . <p> I closed the door and took a few steps in the direction of Yoder 's before I changed my mind . I yanked the door open again , reached into the back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The little guy glared at me , a mixture of irritation and astonishment . <p> " Daaaaad ! " <p> " Sorry , Matthew . I 'm , learning to loosen up . " <p> " Well , ya are n't too good at it yet . " <p> I stole the chicken-and-pig truck , an impetuous gesture that Gator would have appreciated . This was done not without guilt , of course  --  I was quite sorry to be depriving an honest farmer of livestock . <p> " This is criminal , Dad , " Matthew reminded me , bouncing on the passenger seat . <p> " A greater good is being done , though , " I said lamely . The greater good , I told myself , was revenge . <p> The steering wheel was insanely loose . I had to spin it at least two revolutions to turn in any direction , which caused me to flatten dozens of stalks of corn by the road . The livestock reacted with a long chores of snorking and squawking , apparently not used to bouncing across ditches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fasten the old-time shoulder harness . <p> By the time we reached Gator 's place the flames had broken through the roof . A cone of black smoke spread into the sky , and damn if I did n't hear a siren far away . <p> Matthew could do nothing but pump his little legs and point at the flames : " Dad ! Dad ! " <p> I eased the truck down the hill into Gator 's lake sideyard . There were five slime babies scattered about the yard now , two of them rolling around in the basil beds . At the sight of them , Matthew 's voice rose into an incomprehensible squeal . <p> I stopped at the lake 's edge , got out of the cab , and pulled Matthew out of the passenger door . I released the parking brake . The patchwork track lumbered into the dark lake and sank quickly , taking its considerable cargo of animal DNA with it . <p> If slime babies could emerge from just a trace of urine , now the lakeside would be populated with slime chickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a drain that would be on PIXICO 's imaging capabilities was unknowable . But it was a nice symbolic parting shot . A 9mm parting shot . <p> " We really got ta get out of here , Dad . " <p> " How ' bout I throw you in too ? " <p> <p> By Jeff Bredenberg <p> Jeff Bredenberg 's first appearance in F &SF; ( " Imagine a Large-Breasted Woman , " February , 1994 ) proved to be one of our more talked about stories of the year . " Shootin ' Babies " should fall into the same category <p> The origin of " Shootin ' Babies " came from a discussion Jeff had with his colleagues at the Wilmington , Delaware , News Journal . " We were discussing how important it is to be consistent in your service to customers , " he writes . " Customers should not have to wonder why their newspaper arrives at home at 6 AM one day and 8 AM the next . So I began to wonder  --  what if our common appliances operated like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years old and I love him dearly . I 've never even entertained the thought of hurting him and I do not own guns . " <p>
