<p> When one talks with Willie Ansley these days , the words most often heard are " " confident " and " " comfortable . " That 's because after two years of injuries , the soft-spoken outfielder for the Class AAA Tucson Toros finally feels confident  --  and comfortable  --  on the baseball field again . <p> Four years ago , Ansley was one of the top prospects in the game . After hitting .458 with seven home runs for Plainview High School , Ansley was selected by the Astros with the seventh pick in the June 1988 draft . Ansley passed up a football scholarship offer from the University of Oklahoma to sign with the organization . <p> And Ansley did not disappoint , being selected by Baseball America as the best offensive and defensive prospect in the South Atlantic League after hitting .309 with six homers and 55 RBIs in 103 games with the Tourists his first year in the organization . And there were other flashes of greatness along the way , like his back-to-back inside-the-park homers in one game two years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 23-year-old Ansley of a large chunk of playing  --  and development  --  time . <p> But Ansley says he is fine now , and ready to reclaim his status as a top prospect . <p> " " Right now , I 'm feeling really comfortable , " Ansley said . <p> " " I have n't had any problems with my back . A little twinge here and there , but nothing to make me miss any time . I have n't been sitting down because of my back , and that 's something I 'm happy about  - -  going this far and not having any problems with my back . " <p> Ansley , whose batting average has slumped to .261 after a strong start , said the only real adjustment is getting used to the long season again . <p> " " It 's kind of different , " Ansley said . " " I have n't played this long in quite a while . But I do n't know if that 's why ( he 's slumping ) . Probably the biggest thing is because my timing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has something to do with it . Just getting that full season under my belt after missing really parts of two years ( 137 games played in two years ) . " <p> Plus Ansley is getting used to his first taste of Class AAA ball , which can be daunting at times for a young player in the Pacific Coast League . <p> " " Right now , I 'm still trying to learn a lot of the pitchers ( in the PCL ) , " Ansley said . " " Early on , I was having to lay off a lot of breaking balls , which was hard to do sometimes . But I 'm working on it . That breaking ball in the dirt was the biggest thing . With me , once I start getting to the point where I 'm swinging at them , I need to learn to hold off . <p> " " I 'm pretty happy with my strikeouts-to-bases on balls ( ratio ) . I wish my strikeouts would be a little bit lower . They were about even a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately . I could be a little more patient at the plate , though . <p> " " I 'm happy with the way things are going now . I 've been playing left ( field ) lately . They started me out in right , and I really did n't feel comfortable out there . But they moved me to left field and I feel a lot more comfortable out there and I feel confident . So far I have n't had any major problems . " <p> Tucson  --  " " Lucky Lindy " continues to shine . First baseman Jim Lindeman has hit in seven consecutive games , including a 6-for-10 streak with seven RBIs in two games  --  a 10-3 win and a 9-5 loss to Calgary ( Mariners ) Wednesday and Thursday . In those same two games , shortstop Orlando Miller is 6-for-9 with seven RBIs , including a grand slam off the Cannons ' Mike Walker . The loss of closer Todd Jones , who was promoted to Houston , was evident in that 9-5 loss . The Toros led 5-0 going into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had not given up a run in over a month . Catcher John Massarelli , who leads the Pacific Coast League with 31 steals , is riding a 20-for-49 streak ( .408 ) . <p> Shane Reynolds has a 2.02 ERA over his last 10 outings ( 3-1 record ) . <p> Jackson  --  Catcher Scott Mackarewicz , first baseman Roberto Petagine , outfielder Brian Hunter , utility player Frank Kellner and pitchers Jim Bruske , Alvin Morman and Jim Dougherty were named to play in the Texas League All-Star Game July 19 at Wichita . Morman who has been sidelined with a strained rotator cuff , will be unable to play . Outfielder Lance Madsen has six homers in his last 14 games , giving him 15 for the season . After a rough start , outfielder Chris Hatcher is settling into his designated-hitter 's role . Hatcher , who missed a month after shoulder surgery , is hitting 5-for-28 ( .174 ) in that role . Thanks to the bullpen , which has converted 29 of 32 saves , the Generals are 35-1 when they lead after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest crowd of the season , for Fireworks Night July 3 , but could get only 1,000 to watch Sid Fernandez pitch for the Port St. Lucie Mets Sunday night . <p> Fernandez , who was 1-0 in five starts before going on the disabled list May 5 with an injury to his right knee , is on a rehab assignment . Randy Hennis , who had an ERA of 40.50 after getting shelled for three earned runs in two-thirds of an inning in his first start , has not given up a run since ( three starts ) . That streak of six innings has shaved his ERA to 4.05 as the 28-year-old Hennis is trying to come back from a shoulder problem that caused him to miss all of last season . <p> Quad City  --  The soggy River Bandits continue to win , despite the flooding problems that have forced them out of John O'Donnell Field . Quad City went 3-1  --  all road games  --  behind outfielders Tim Evans and Vince Roman , who were both 7-for-17 in the games ( .412 ) . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and catcher Mario Linares , who are mired in 2-for-16 ( .125 ) and 1-for-9 ( .111 ) slides , respectively . <p> Asheville  --  After 13 games , the Tourists were already 10 games behind the first-place Charleston ( W.V. ) Wheelers ( Reds ) . <p> Charleston won 10 of its first 12 games while Asheville was losing 13 of its first 16 . Reliever Jose Centeno returned home to Anzoategui , Venezuela , after his father was killed in a car accident . The Jermanine Swinton experiment is on hold for now . <p> Swinton , who was moved from the outfield to first base , has been benched in favor of Kevin Webb . Webb is hitting only .220 , but that is 45 points higher than Swinton , who is striking out once every other at-bat . <p> NOTES : Michael Murphy covers the Astros ' minor-league system for the Chronicle .
