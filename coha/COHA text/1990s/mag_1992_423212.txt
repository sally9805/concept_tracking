<p> THE BENI BIOSPHERE RESERVE ( BBR ) , home of the Chimane Indians and the first protected area to become fully implemented in Bolivia , is leading the way for the conservation of the natural and cultural resources in this extremely diverse Andean country . <p> In 1988 when I was working for the Bolivia Program at Conservation International a friend gave me a copy of a newly published book , Pueblo de leyenda , written by Rodolfo Pinto . The author took me by surprise . Through parallel stories , a thousand years apart , he talked about the Beni , the so called " region of winds " in Moxeno language . He told a story about the land of Paititi , populated by vigorous and hard working indigenous people who harvested their living off the luscious tropical forests and savannas of Moxos . At the same time , he told the story of the Beni of our days , as seen by a professional explorer , a Quixote who came to find the testimony of a nation rich in history and suffering . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Our conservation work in the Beni , I thought then , was a battle of times , cultures and peoples trying to come together in one legendary place , in the same environment but with so many one-sided visions . Somehow the cause for nature 's and people 's future had been divided , and the goals seemed separate . I remember quoting from Pueblo de leyenda , " It is hard to start a fire with one stick of wood , if we could just get all the firewood together in one pile ... boy , we 'd be cooking . " <p> Now , four years later , tremendous strides have been taken for the conservation of the natural resources of Bolivia . Bolivians are successfully setting national priorities for conservation and a framework for conservation investments has been instituted . At the same time , historical events have furthered the indigenous cause in the country . THE LAY OF THE LAND <p> Landlocked in the heart of South America , Bolivia is a nation of astounding contrasts and breathtaking landscapes encompassing tropical , subtropical , and montane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1.1 million km2 ) , Bolivia contains snowcapped mountains in the West and salt lakes and dry forests in the central Altiplano . In this region , legendary civilizations such as the Tiwanaku ( 500 BC ) and the Inca empire ( 1200 AD ) flourished . East of the Andes , cloud forest and a mosaic of grassland savannas , rivers , and tropical forest constitute 70 percent of the country . <p> Bolivia 's diverse ecology is matched by the diversity of its culture . Its population , estimated at six million in 1980 , is concentrated largely in the highlands . Mestizo , Aymara , and Quechua represent roughly 80 percent of Bolivia 's population , with approximately 15 percent of European ancestry . The highlanders were , and still are , highly organized societies , unlike the fifty-five ethnic groups in the eastern lowland which comprise approximately 5 percent of the country 's population and have been traditionally isolated from one another . <p> Biologically , Bolivia is one of the richest nations in the world with a plant diversity of 18,000 known species , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the bird species found in the neotropics . Economically , however , ( according to World Bank data ) Bolivia is the poorest country of South America , with the lowest life expectancy in the Western Hemisphere , and an infant mortality second only to Haiti 's and almost double that of Guatemala . <p> The threats facing biodiversity in Bolivia are numerous . Forest and soil resources of the eastern slope of the Andes and lowlands are under increasing pressure as migrants move from the highlands , partly in response to the deterioration of agricultural soils at upper elevations . Unequal land distribution and , more recently , the collapse of the tin mining industry ( which formerly contributed 70 percent of the country 's GNP ) has resulted in more pressure on the lowlands as local peoples increasingly rely on cattle ranching , mahogany extraction , and drug trafficking as economic alternatives to meet their basic needs . On a more positive note , after over a decade of political and social turmoil , Bolivia is experiencing its third democratically elected government , led by President Jaime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eastern lowlands of Bolivia , is part of the Amazon Basin and contrasts starkly with the highland plateaus and subtropical valleys to the west . Second largest of Bolivia 's nine provinces , the Beni is almost four times the size of Costa Rica . The region is a complex blend of eastern Andean slopes , seasonally flooded savanna , forest , lakes and rivers . It is sparsely populated , with an estimated one inhabitant per sq . km. , and isolated from Bolivia 's population centers by lack of roads . <p> In 1966 , William Denevan , a geographer and researcher of aboriginal civilizations , speculated that as many as five hundred thousand Indians may have inhabited this area before its discovery by Spanish explorers . A hundred thousand linear drained fields , numerous canals , and large and small mound fields are still seen in the Beni savannas , where there is seemingly little opportunity for agriculture because of seasonal flooding . THE ROOTS OF A RESERVE <p> The Ecosystem Conservation Program in the Beni , an example of regional planning for conservation and development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of Bolivian institutions , the people of the Beni , and professionals in Conservation International , a Washington , D.C.-based nonprofit organization . <p> Conservation in Bolivia  --  as it is understood today  --  is quite recent . For many years and diverse reasons this biologically rich country escaped the plans and agendas of the larger conservation organizations . In 1985 a group of Bolivians and some key international institutions , among them Estacion Biologica de Donana , The Nature Conservancy and later Conservation International , initiated a serious rnultidisciplinary effort for the preservation of natural resources in the region . <p> The Beni program was founded on the basic premise that conservation should go hand in hand with development . Important consideration was given to the belief that long term conservation in the tropics will only succeed when three conditions are met : local institutions take the lead , local knowledge is efficiently used and integrated , and social needs are fulfilled . In this scenario , foreign conservation organizations play specific roles as purveyors of technical assistance and catalytic financial support . <p> The Beni Biosphere Reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Station , created in 1982 under the supervision of the Bolivian Academy of Sciences and the Estaci6n Biologica de Donana . The Reserve , containing 135,000 hectares , is home to the Chimane Indians and a small group of mestizos . It is an area of diverse forest formations bounded on the northeast and west by vast extensions of open , seasonally-flooded savanna grasslands . The region supports 13 of Bolivia 's 18 endangered tropical animal species , and a preliminary survey identified more than 450 species of birds , 8 species of primates , 5 of cats and 40 species of bats . In 1986 , this area was recognized officially by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve  --  an area designated for multiple functions , including integrating native populations into the ecosystem . <p> For five years , an inter-institutional team worked to expand knowledge about the area , formulate a management plan , and efficiently incorporate the BBR into its regional context . Lead by Bolivian biologist Carmen Miranda , the team was comprised of members of the Bolivian Academy of Sciences , the San Andres National University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Development , and the Center for Community Studies . Financial and technical support was provided by Conservation International . Under the leadership of Dr. Mario Baudoin of the Bolivian Institute of Ecology , a series of essential technical tasks were carried out , including the biological inventorying and development of preliminary vegetation maps of the Reserve . Population surveys were made by the Bolivian Museum of Ethnography and Folklore and the University of Florida , and additional information was gathered by the Smithsonian Institution 's BIOLAT Program . All of this data played an important role in the initial zoning of the Reserve . <p> By 1986 , the BBR team was focusing on environmental education to determine effective ways of influencing resource use among local people . The program worked with two important population centers near the Reserve , El Totaizal and San Borja , through formal and informal education systems . Radio was used as principal vehicle of communication with and among indigenous inhabitants of the area . Currently plans are in the works for public campaigns to stimulate environmental awareness . <p> Institutionally , the BBR has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three person office in La Paz allows for international and national networking . In the field , El Porvenir ranch , the Biological Station 's headquarters , has a resident Scientific Coordinator , an Administrator and an initial Park Guard body . The accommodations in El Porvenir are also used by full time researchers , potential project personnel and visitors . <p> Recently , the Bolivian government has taken great interest in the Reserve as a baseline for development and colonization and the Regional Forest Service has appropriated 7 percent of the timber production taxes directly for conservation work in the BBR . The BBR 's present challenge is the integration of the needs of its own inhabitants , Chimane Indians and mestizos , into the Reserve 's management guidelines and services . Appropriate forums and decision making processes need to be implemented so that scientists and local inhabitants can exchange information and make joint decisions . Miranda comments , " the central objective of BBR 's strategy during the nineties is the consolidation of the Reserve and its people , working for one another and encouraging lasting change . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forest Reserve surrounding the BBR changed status . Through a decision of the regional government , this area was opened to the extraction of timber . The change in status was said to be part of the government 's effort to monitor and tax timber extraction which , , according to locals , " had been going on informally for a number of years . The decision was intimately tied to local pressures and governmental operational budgets . <p> The area in question , known generally as the Chimane Forest , is inhabited by four ethnic groups : the Chimane , the Moxeno , the Yuracare and the Movima , all of them at different levels of assimilation to the more Westernized way of life of the mestizos in the area . This smaller population of mestizos is comprised of old time cattle ranchers , loggers , newly arrived colonists from the Andes , and commerical dealers . Most of the mestizos reside in the towns of San Borja and San Ignacio  --  located on the fringes of the Chimane Forest  --  which boast populations of 17,000 and 10,000 respectively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a mosaic of restricted use sectors determined by regional policies already in place  --  i.e. , the regional government 's decision to grant timber concessions in a sector of the forest , and the potential for land use . Population distribution within these areas and provincial boundaries were not taken into account in the intial zoning . The diverse ecosystem under consideration was comprised of : the Chimane Permanent Production Forest ( 590,000 hectares ) , where some of the oldest and riches mahogany and cedar strands were being selectively extracted ; the Yacuma Regional Park ( 130,000 hectares ) , an area of savanna where cattle ranching is prevalent ; an area set aside for watershed protection ( 225,000 hectares ) with virtually untouched and unknown forests ; and the Beni Biosphere Reserve ( 135,000 hectares ) . <p> Later that year , the Beni Regional Forestry Service invited the Beni Biosphere Reserve and Conservation International to assist in creating a sound forestry policy for the exploitation of the Chimane Forest Reserve . The three institutions thus became the the center of a project to develop a management plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resources within the one million hectares surrounding the Beni Biosphere Reserve . <p> Then on July 13 , 1987 , Conservation International , led by Maria Teresa Ortiz , signed an agreement with the Bolivian government which included the first debt-for-nature swap in history . With this landmark negotiation , an integrated , multi-sectorial environmental management effort was launched . Planning was initiated through an Inter-Institution , al Commission ( CTI ) supported by the Beni Forestry Service , Conservation International and the local Association of Lumbering Companies . Socio-economic analyses carried out by the CTI identified human settlements , colonization trends and potential resource use , and recommended that local people be included in the planning process and long-term management . CTI evaluations also called for immediate attention to the Permanent Production Forest . By the end of 1988 , the International Timber Trade Organization had granted three years of technical and financial support for a forestry program in Chimane . Unfortunately , these projects seemed to increase the lumber interests ' power to destroy the forest . <p> Ultimately the CTI 's work became a vital instrument in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims of indigenous peoples , impacting the future of indigenous peoples in Eastern Bolivia as well . The concerns of the Indian peoples had been voiced by a federation called the Central de Cabildos Indigenales Moxenos at the Decision-Makers Forum sponsored by CTI in November , 1988 , in Trinidad ( the capital of Beni ) . By the end of the year a demand was made to the central government ( under President Paz Estenssoro ) to grant territorial rights to the four principal tribes inhabiting the Forest , and in early 1989 the CTI was dissolved and the Chimane Program officially established . <p> The national government recommended that lands be given to the Indians in the forest fringe leaving timber concessions in the center . This plan was rejected immediately by the indigenous peoples as biased . Finally , in September , 1990 , more than 300 Indians from the Beni region marched 400 miles from Trinidad to La Paz during 32 days . Along the way they were joined by another 400 native inhabitants . In reaction to this " March for Dignity and Territory , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complying with native territorial demands , and the fourth establishing a commission to draft an Indian law that will give legal standing to traditional leaders and governing bodies . <p> The institutions involved in the area are currently readjusting their plans . One-third of the Beni Biosphere Reserve is now Chimane Indian territory , which extends into the former watershed protection area . Half of what was formerly the Permanent Production Forest is now the Multiethnic territory . The Beni Interdisciplinary Center for Development and the BBR are developing the Preliminary Management Plan for the Multiethnic Territory , home of the Moxeno , Yuracare and Movima . Conservation International is focusing on strengthening the Greater Chimane Council and exploring with them the sustainable production and fair commercialization of the jatata palm , one of their forest products sold in local markets . According to Bolivian anthropologist Guillermo Rioja , " we believe that the most effective and ethical method of sustainable use of the tropical forest reserves of the Beni is through assistance to the self determined activities of the traditional  --  and now legal  --  owners of the forest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its jurisdiction to the remaining lumber concessions and is still struggling with seemingly unbearable timber extraction . <p> Much remains to be done in the Beni and Bolivia has taken the challenge wholeheartedly . President Paz Zamora has made conservation a national priority in Bolivia . In 1990 he declared an " ecological pause , " calling for a moratorium on the granting of new logging concessions pending further study of forest reserves and forest policies . More recent governmental initiatives relevant to biodiversity conservation include the establishment of the General Secretariat for the Environment and National Environmental Fund which will coordinate and allocate international financing . <p> New winds are blowing in Bolivia . Like the surazos  --  winds from the south bringing cold and mist  --  they have arrived suddenly , causing unsettling weather , but bearing fruit . The celebration of life seems to be revitalized and ready for the next test of nature . In our quest for a better future for the forest and its people , we have learned , as one Beni leader put it , " great efforts and great successes are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... they are the product of much inspiration , patience and endurance . " <p> MAP : SINCE THE 1990 PROTESTS BY INDIGENOUS GROUPS . MUCH OF THE CHIMANE FOREST HAS BEEN RETURNED TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNERS .
