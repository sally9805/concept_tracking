Let me kill him , " Cara said , her boot strikes sounding like rawhide mallets hammering the polished marble floor . The supple leather boots Kahlan wore beneath her elegant , white Confessor 's dress whispered against the cold stone as she tried to keep pace without letting her legs break into a run . " No . " Cara exhibited no response , keeping her blue eyes ahead to the wide corridor stretching into the distance . A dozen leather- and chain-mail-clad D'Haran soldiers , their unadorned swords sheathed , or crescent-bladed battle-axes hooked on belt hangers , crossed at an intersection just ahead . Though their weapons were n't drawn , every wooden hilt was gripped in a ready fist as vigilant eyes scrutinized the shadows among the doorways and columns to each side . Their hasty bows toward Kahlan only briefly interrupted their attention to their task . " We ca n't just kill him , " Kahlan explained . " We need answers . " An eyebrow lifted over one icy blue eye . " Oh , I did n't say he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer any question you have when I 'm finished with him . " A mirthless smile ghosted across her flawless face . " That is the job of a Mord-Sith : getting people to answer questions " she paused as the smile returned to widen with professional satisfaction --  " before they die . " Kahlan heaved a sigh . " Cara , that 's no longer your job -- your life . Your job now is to protect Richard . " " That is why you should let me kill him . We should not take a risk by letting this man live . " " No . We first have to find out what 's going on , and we 're not going to start out doing it the way you want . " Cara 's smile , humorless as it was , had vanished again . " As you wish , Mother Confessor . " Kahlan wondered how the woman had managed to change into her skintight red leather outfit so fast . Whenever there was so much as a whiff of trouble , at least one of the three Mord-Sith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Red , as they often pointed out , did n't show blood . " Are you sure he said that , this man ? Those were his words ? " " Yes , Mother Confessor , his exact words . You should let me kill him before he has a chance to try to bring them to pass . " Kahlan ignored the repeated request as they hurried on down the hall . " Where 's Richard ? " " You wish me to get Lord Rahl ? " " No ! I just want to know where he is , in case there 's trouble . " " I would say that this qualifies as trouble . " " You said that there must be two hundred soldiers holding weapons on him . How much trouble can one man cause with all those swords , axes , and arrows pointed at him ? " " My former master , Darken Rahl , knew that steel alone could not always ward danger . That is why he had Mord-Sith nearby and at the ready . " " That evil man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really a danger to him . Richard is n't like that , and neither am I. You know that if there is a true threat , I 'm not shy about eliminating it ; but if this man is more than he seems , then why is he so timidly cowering before all that steel ? Besides , as a Confessor I am hardly defenseless against threats that steel wo n't stop . " We have to keep our heads . Let 's not start leaping to judgments that may be unwarranted . " " If you do n't think he could be trouble , then why am I nearly running to just keep up with you ? " Kahlan realized that she was a half a step ahead of the woman . She slowed her pace to a brisk walk . " Because it 's Richard we 're talking about , " she said in a near whisper . Cara smirked . " You 're as worried as I. " " Of course I am . But for all we know , killing this man , if he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You could be right , but that is the purpose for Mord-Sith . " " So , where is Richard ? " Cara gripped the red leather at her wrist and stretched her armor-backed glove tighter onto her hand as she flexed her fist . Her Agiel , an awesome weapon that appeared to be nothing more than a finger-width foot-long red leather rod , dangled from a fine gold chain at her right wrist , ever at the ready . One just like it , but no weapon in Kahlan 's hands , hung on a chain around Kahlan 's neck . It had been a gift from Richard , a gift that symbolized the pain and sacrifice they had both endured . " He is out behind the palace , in one of the private parks . " Cara gestured over her shoulder . " The one that way . Raina and Berdine are with him . " Kahlan was relieved to hear that the other two Mord-Sith were watching over him . " Something to do with his surprise for me ? " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you , Cara . " Cara snatched a glimpse out of the corner of her eye . " Of course he has told me . " " Then what is it ? " " He also told me not to tell you . " Kahlan shrugged . " I wo n't tell him that you told me . " Cara 's laugh , like her smile before , bore no humor . " Lord Rahl has a peculiar way of finding out things , especially those things you wish him not to know . " Kahlan knew the truth of that . " So what 's he doing out there ? " The muscles in Cara 's jaw flexed . " Outdoor things . You know Lord Rahl ; he likes to do outdoor things . " Kahlan glanced over to see that Cara 's face had turned nearly as red as her leather outfit . " What sort of outdoor things ? " Cara cleared her throat into her armored fist . " He is taming chipmunks . " " He 's what ? I ca n't hear you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the chipmunks have come out to test the warming weather . He is taming them . " Her cheeks rounded as she huffed . " With seeds . " Kahlan smiled at the thought of Richard , the man she loved , the man who had seized command of D'Hara , and had much of the Midlands now eating out of his hand , having a fine afternoon teaching chipmunks to eat seeds out of his hand . " Well , that sounds innocent enough -- feeding seeds to chipmunks . " Cara flexed her armored fist again as they swept between two D'Haran guards . " He is teaching them to eat those seeds , " she said through clenched teeth , " out of Raina and Berdine 's hands . The two of them were giggling ! " She aimed a mortified expression toward the ceiling as she threw her hands up . Her Agiel swung on the gold chain at her wrist . " Mord-Sith -- giggling ! " Kahlan pressed her lips tight , trying to keep from breaking into laughter . Cara pulled her long blond braid forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provoked in Kahlan an unsettling memory of the way Shota , the witch woman , stroked her snakes . " Well , " Kahlan said , trying to cool the other woman 's indignation , " maybe it 's not by their choice . They are bonded to him . Perhaps Richard ordered it , and they 're simply obeying him . " Cara shot her an incredulous look . Kahlan knew that any of the three Mord-Sith would defend Richard to the death -- they had shown themselves prepared to sacrifice their lives without hesitation -- but though they were bonded to him through magic , they disregarded his orders wantonly if they judged them trivial , unimportant , or unwise . Kahlan imagined that it was because Richard had given them their freedom from the rigid principles of their profession , and they enjoyed exercising that freedom . Darken Rahl , their former master , Richard 's father , would have killed them in a heartbeat had he even suspected that they were considering disobeying his orders , no matter how trivial they were . " The sooner you wed Lord Rahl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat out of Mord-Sith hands , he will be eating out of yours . " Kahlan exhaled in a soft , lilting laugh , thinking about being his wife . It would n't be long , now . " Richard will have my hand , but you should know as well as anyone that he will not be eating out of it -- and I would n't want him to . " " If you regain your senses , come see me , and I will teach you how . " Cara turned her attention to the alert D'Haran soldiers . Men at arms were rushing everywhere , checking every hall and looking behind every door , no doubt at Cara 's insistence . " Egan is with Lord Rahl , too . He should be safe while we see to this man . " Kahlan 's mirth withered . " How did he get in here , anyway ? Did he come in with the petitioners ? " " No . " A professional chill settled back into Cara 's tone . " But I intend to find out . From what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guards not far from the council chambers and asked where he could find Lord Rahl , as if just anyone can walk in and ask to see the Master of D'Hara , as if he was a head butcher that anyone can go to if they want a choice cut of mutton . " " That 's when the guards asked him why he wanted to see Richard ? " Cara nodded . " I think we should kill him . " Realization wormed up Kahlan 's spine in a cold tingle . Cara was n't simply an aggressive bodyguard , unconcerned about spilling the blood of others -- she was afraid . She was afraid for Richard . " I want to know how he got in here . He presented himself to a patrol inside the palace ; he should n't have been able to get inside , wandering around unfettered . What if we have a hitherto-unknown breach in security ? Would n't it be better to find out before another comes without the courtesy of announcing himself ? " " We can find out if you let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know enough yet ; he could end up dead before we find out anything , then the danger to Richard could become greater . " " All right , " Cara said with a sigh , " we will do it your way , as long as you understand that I have orders to follow . " " What orders ? " " Lord Rahl told us to protect you as we would protect him . " With a toss of her head , Cara flicked her blond braid back over her shoulder . " If you are not careful , Mother Confessor , and needlessly endanger Lord Rahl with your restraint , I will withdraw my permission for Richard to keep you . " Kahlan laughed . Her laughter died out when Cara did n't so much as smile . She was never entirely sure when the Mord-Sith were joking and when they were being deadly serious . " In here , " Kahlan said . " It 's shorter this way , and besides , I want to see what petitioners are waiting , in view of our strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our attention away from someone else -- the true threat . " Cara 's brow twitched as if she had been slighted . " Why do you think I had Petitioners ' Hall sealed and ringed with guards ? " " You did it surreptitiously , I hope . There 's no need to frighten the wits out of innocent petitioners . " " I told the officers not to frighten the people in there if they did n't have to , but our first responsibility is to protect Lord Rahl . " Kahlan nodded . She could n't argue with that . Two heavily muscled guards bowed , along with twenty others nearby , before pulling open the tall , brassbound doors leading to an arcaded passageway . A stone rail supported by fat , vase-shaped balusters ran along the white marble pillars . The barrier , separating the petitioners in the hundred-foot-long room from the officials ' passageway , was symbolic rather than real . Skylights thirty feet overhead lit the waiting room , but left the length of the passageway to the muted golden light of lamps hung in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long-standing custom for people -- petitioners -- to come to the Confessors ' Palace to seek any number of things , from settlement of disagreements over the rights of peddlers to coveted street corners , to officials of different lands seeking armed intervention in border disputes . Matters that could be handled by city officials were directed to the proper offices . Matters brought by dignitaries of the lands , if those matters were deemed to be important enough , or could be handled in no other way , were taken before the council . Petitioners ' Hall was where officers of protocol determined the disposition of requests . When Darken Rahl , Richard 's father , had attacked the Midlands , many of the officials in Aydindril had been killed , among them Saul Witherrin , the Chief of Protocol , along with most of his office . Richard had defeated Darken Rahl , and being the gifted heir , had ascended to Master of D'Hara . He had ended the bickering and battling among the lands of the Midlands by demanding their surrender in order to forge them all into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World , from the Imperial Order . Kahlan found it unsettling to be the Mother Confessor who had reigned over the end of the Midlands as a formal entity , a union of sovereign lands , but she knew that her first responsibility was to the lives of the people , not to tradition ; if not stopped , the Imperial Order would cast the world into slavery , and the people of the Midlands would be its chattel . Richard had accomplished what his father could not , but did so for entirely different reasons . She loved Richard and knew his benevolent intent in seizing power . Soon they would be wedded , and their marriage would unite the Midlands and D'Hara in peace and unity for all time . More than that , though , it would be a personal fulfillment of their love and deepest desire : to be one . Kahlan missed Saul Witherrin ; he had been a capable aide . With the council now dead , too , and the Midlands now a part of D'Hara , matters of protocol were in disarray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attempting to minister to the petitioners ' needs . As she entered , Kahlan 's gaze swept the waiting crowd , analyzing the nature of problems brought to the palace this day . By their dress , most appeared to be people from the surrounding city of Aydindril : labors , shopkeepers , and merchants . She saw a knot of children she knew from the day before when Richard had taken her to watch them playing a game of Ja'La . It was the first time she had seen the fast-paced game , and it had been an entertaining diversion for a couple of hours : to watch children play and laugh . The children probably wanted Richard to come watch another game ; he had been an ardent supporter of each team . Even if he had picked one team to cheer over the other , Kahlan doubted it would have made any difference ; children were drawn to Richard , seeming to instinctively sense his kind heart . Kahlan recognized several diplomats from a few of the smaller lands , who she hoped had come to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'Haran rule . She knew the leaders of those lands , and was expecting them to heed her urging to join with them in the cause of freedom . She recognized , too , a group of diplomats from some of the larger lands that had standing armies . They had been expected , and later that day Richard and Kahlan were to meet with them , along with any other newly arrived representatives , to hear their decision . She wished Richard would find himself something more suitable to wear . His woods clothes had served him well , but he now needed to present a more fitting image of the position he found himself in . He was so much more than a woods guide now . Having served nearly her whole life as a person of authority , Kahlan knew that it often smoothed matters of leadership if you matched people 's expectations . Kahlan doubted people who needed a woods guide would have followed Richard if he had n't dressed for the woods . In a way , Richard was their guide in this treacherous new world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her advice ; she was going to have to talk to him about his clothes . When the people assembled saw the Mother Confessor striding into the passageway , conversation stilled and they began going to a knee in deep bows . Despite the fact that she was of an unprecedentedly young age for the post , there was no one of higher authority in the Midlands than the Mother Confessor . The Mother Confessor was the Mother Confessor , no matter the face of the woman who held the office . People bowed not so much to the woman as to that ancient authority . Matters of Confessors were an enigma to most people of the Midlands ; Confessors chose the Mother Confessor . To Confessors , age was of secondary consideration . Though she was chosen to preserve the freedoms and rights of the people of the Midlands , people rarely saw it in those terms . To most , a ruler was a ruler . Some were good , some were bad . As the ruler of rulers , the Mother Confessor encouraged the good , and suppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was within her power to eliminate them . That was the ultimate purpose of a Mother Confessor . To most people , though , such far removed matters of governance simply seemed the squabbling of rulers . In the sudden silence that filled Petitioners ' Hall , Kahlan paused to acknowledge the gathered visitors . A young woman standing against the far wall watched as all those around her fell to one knee . She glanced in Kahlan 's direction , back to those kneeling , and then followed suit . Kahlan 's brow tightened . In the Midlands , the length of a woman 's hair denoted her power and standing Matters of power , no matter how trivial they might seem on the surface , were taken seriously in the Midlands . Not even a queen 's hair was allowed to be as long as a Confessor 's , and no Confessor 's hair was as long as that of the Mother Confessor . This woman had a thick mass of brown hair close to the length of Kahlan 's . Kahlan knew nearly every person of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she took it seriously . A woman with hair that long was obviously a person of high standing , but Kahlan did n't recognize her . There was likely to be no man or woman in the entire city , other than Kahlan , who would outrank the woman-if she was in fact from the Midlands . " Rise , my children , " Kahlan said in formal response to the tops of the waiting , bowed heads . Dresses and coats rustled as everyone began coming to their feet , most keeping their eyes to the floor , out of respect , or needless fear . The woman rose to her feet , twisting a simply made kerchief in her fingers , watching those around her . She turned her brown eyes to the floor , as most of the others were . " Cara , " Kahlan whispered , " could that woman there , with the long hair , be from D'Hara ? " Cara had been watching her , too ; she had learned some of the customs of the Midlands . Though Cara 's long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was D'Haran . They did n't live by the same customs . " Her nose is too ' cute ' to be D'Haran . " " I 'm serious . Do you think she could be D'Haran ? " Cara studied the woman a moment longer . " I doubt it . D'Haran women do n't wear flower-print dresses , nor are the dresses they do wear of that cut . But clothes can be changed to fit the occasion , or to fit in with local people . " The dress did n't really fit the local dress of Aydindril , but it might not be so out of place in other , more remote , areas of the Midlands . Kahlan nodded and turned to a waiting captain , motioning him over . He leaned his head close as she spoke in a low tone . " There is a woman with long brown hair standing against the wall in the back , over my left shoulder . Do you see who I 'm talking about ? " " The pretty one , in the blue kirtle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " " She said she wished to speak with Lord Rahl . " Kahlan 's brow drew tighter . She noticed that Cara 's did , too . " What about ? " " She said that she 's looking for a man -- Cy something -- I did n't recognize his name . She said he 's been missing since last autumn , and she was told that Lord Rahl would be able to help her . " " Is that right , " Kahlan said . " And did she say what business she has with this missing man ? " The captain glanced to the woman and then brushed his sandy hair back from his forehead . " She said that she 's to marry him . " Kahlan nodded . " It could be that she 's a dignitary , but if she is , I 'm embarrassed to admit that I do n't know her name . " The captain glanced at a tattered list with scribbles all over it . He turned the paper and scanned the other side until he found what he was looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave no title . " " Well , please see to it that Lady Nadine is taken to a private waiting room where she will be comfortable . Tell her that I will come speak with her and see if I can help . Have dinner brought to her , along with anything else she might require . Give her my apology and tell her that I have something of vital importance that I must attend to first , but I will come see her as soon as I am able , and that I wish to do what I can to help her . " Kahlan could understand the woman 's distress if she really was separated from her love and was searching for him . Kahlan had been in that situation herself and knew well the anguish . " I 'll see to it at once , Mother Confessor . " " One other thing , captain . " Kahlan watched the woman twisting her kerchief . " Tell Lady Nadine that there is trouble about , what with the war with the Old World , and that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room until I can come to speak with her . Post a heavy guard outside the room . Place archers at a safe distance down the hall to either side of the door . " If she comes out , insist that she must return to the room at once and wait . If you must , tell her that it is by my command . If she still tries to leave "  - -  Kahlan looked into the captain 's waiting blue eyes --  " kill her . " The captain bowed as Kahlan swept on through the passageway , Cara right at her heels . " Well , well , " Cara said , once outside Petitioners ' Hall , " at last the Mother Confessor comes to her senses . I knew I had a good reason for allowing Lord Rahl to keep you . You will make him a worthy wife . " Kahlan turned down the corridor toward the room where guards held the man . " I have n't changed my mind about anything , Cara . Considering our strange visitor , I 'm giving Lady Nadine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give , but you 're mistaken if you think I 'll balk at doing whatever it takes to protect Richard . Besides being the man I love more than life itself , Richard is a man of vital importance to the freedom of the people of both D'Hara and the Midlands . There 's no telling what the Imperial Order would try in order to get to him . " Cara smiled , sincerely , this time . " I know he loves you the same . That 's why I do n't like you going to see this man ; Lord Rahl may separate me from my hide if he thinks I allowed you near danger . " " Richard is one born with the gift ; I , too , have been born with magic . Darken Rahl sent quads to kill the Confessors because there is little danger to a Confessor from one man . " Kahlan felt the familiar , yet distant anguish of their deaths . Distant , because it seemed so long ago , though it had been hardly a year . For months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she should be dead along with her sister Confessors , and that she had somehow betrayed them by escaping all the traps laid for her . Now , she was the last . With a flick of her wrist , Cara snapped her Agiel into her fist . " Even a man , like Lord Rahl , born with the gift ? Even a wizard ? " " Even a wizard , and even if , unlike Richard , he knows how to use his power . I not only know how to use mine , I am very experienced at it . I long ago lost count of the number . . . " As Kahlan 's words trailed off , Cara considered her Agiel , rolling it in her fingers . " I guess there is even less than ' little ' danger -- with me there . " When they reached the richly carpeted and paneled corridor they were seeking , it was thick with soldiers and bristling with steel from swords , axes , and pikes . The man was being held in a small , elegant reading room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for meeting with officers and for studying the journal he had found in the Wizard 's Keep . The soldiers had n't wanted to risk an escape attempt and had simply stuffed the man in the room nearest to the spot they found him , pinning him down until it could be decided what was to be done . Kahlan gently took the elbow of a soldier to urge him back out of the way . The muscles of his bare arm felt as hard as iron . His pike , pointed toward the closed door , could hardly have been more steady had it been embedded in granite . There had to be fifty pikes likewise aimed at the silent door . More men , gripping swords or axes , hunkered beneath the pike points . The guard turned as Kahlan tugged on his arm . " Let me through , soldier . " The man gave way . Others glanced back and began moving aside . Cara shouldered her way ahead of Kahlan , pushing men out of the way . They did so reluctantly , not out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited beyond the door . Even as they moved aside , they kept their weapons pointed toward the thick oak door . Inside , the windowless , dimly lit room smelled of leather and sweat . A lanky man squatted on the edge of an embroidered footstool . He seemed too spare , should he make the wrong move , to permit all the steel aimed at him to find a virgin patch to penetrate . His young eyes dithered among the steel and grim glares until he caught sight of Kahlan 's approaching white dress . His tongue darted out to wet his lips as he looked up expectantly . When the burly soldiers in leather and chain mail behind him saw Kahlan and Cara forcing their way into the room , one of them landed the side of his boot on the small of the young man 's back , pitching him forward . " Kneel , you filthy cur . " The young man , dressed in an outsized soldier 's uniform that looked to have been scrounged together from dissimilar sources , peered up at Kahlan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He ducked his head of disheveled dark hair and shielded it with a gangly arm , expecting a blow . " That 's enough , " Kahlan said in a quietly authoritative tone . " Cara and I wish to speak with him . All of you , wait outside , please . " The soldiers balked , reluctant to lift a weapon from the young man cowering on the floor . " You heard her , " Cara said . " Out . " " But --  " an officer began . " You doubt that a Mord-Sith is capable of handling this one scrawny man ? Now , go wait outside . " Kahlan was surprised that Cara had n't raised her voice . Mord-Sith did n't have to raise their voices to get people to follow their orders , but still it surprised her , considering Cara 's nervousness over the young man before them . The men began withdrawing , turning sideways to eye the intruder on the floor as they filed out the door . The knuckles of the officer 's fist around his sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gently closed the door with his other hand . The young man looked up from under his arm to the two women standing three strides away . " Are you going to have me killed ? " Kahlan did n't answer the question directly . " We have come to talk with you . I am Kahlan Amnell , the Mother Confessor --  " " Mother Confessor ! " He straightened on his knees . A boyish grin swept onto his face . " Why , you 're beautiful ! I never expected you to be so beautiful . " He put a hand to a knee and began to rise Cara 's Agiel was instantly at the ready . " Stay where you are . " He froze , staring at the red Agiel before his face , and then lowered the knee back onto the fringe of the crimson carpet . Lamps on the fluted mahogany pilasters supporting shallow pediments over bookcases to each side of the room cast flickering light across his bony face . He was hardly more than a boy . " Can I have my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I ca n't have that , then I 'd like my knife , at least . " Cara heaved an irritated sigh , but Kahlan spoke first . " You are in a very precarious position , young man . None of us is in the mood to be indulgent if this is some kind of prank . " He nodded earnestly . " I understand . I 'm not playing a game . I swear . " " Then tell me what you said to the soldiers . " His grin returned as he lifted a hand , gesturing casually toward the door . " Well like I was telling those men when I was --  " Fists at her side , Kahlan advanced a stride . " I told you , this is no game ! You 're only alive by my grace ! I want to know what you 're doing here , and I want to know right now ! Tell me what you said ! " The young man blinked . " I 'm an assassin , sent by Emperor Jagang . I 'm here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please ? "
