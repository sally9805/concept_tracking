There were only a few perfect spots in the world , and Leo Spivak had finally found one of them , right here in Mendocino . He was stretched out just inside the screen door of the brown-shingled beachfront cottage he and his wife , Rachel , had rented for a week-just the two of them , alone in all this peace and quiet . It was as beautiful and peaceful as a postcard . An adorably disheveled burst of nasturtiums framed the screen door and tumbled down across the tiny lawn of shaved English grass to their own private redwood hot tub . Ocean breezes , tangy with salt , washed over Spivak 's face , and through the mist he could hear very clearly the wet , hypnotic slap of water as it lapped at pilings across the cove . He 'd been looking for this very spot- these flowers , this breeze , these gently lapping waves-all his life . And now here he was . He found himself seriously mulling over the possibility that he 'd never move again-that he would lie quite happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , until he died . <p> And then the phone rang . Spivak closed his eyes . " Honey ? " he moaned . Rachel was snoozing on the couch ; the phone was exactly halfway between them , but Spivak would n't have wanted to answer the damn thing even if it had been nestled next to his cheek . Their daughter , Elena , sixteen , was at a tennis camp in Wisconsin that they could n't afford , and she 'd called them twice already in the past three days pleading for more spending money . " C'm on , " he said , " you get it , okay ? If it 's Elena asking for another two hundred bucks , I 'm liable to say something I 'll regret . I 'm not kidding . And anyway , I ca n't move . I 'm in the perfect spot : ' <p> Rachel caught the phone just after its third ring . She listened a moment , then her face went slack , and she handed the phone to her husband silently , despite his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat down heavily next to her . <p> " Leo ? This is Inez . Your father 's friend in Tucson ? " Though she 'd lived in Tucson all her life , the intonations in her voice were Hispanic . Spivak had always been proud of the fact that it did n't matter one bit to him that Inez was Hispanic . His father , on the other hand , the bigoted bastard , had always given Inez a hard time about her heritage , joking with her about Mexican farting contests and calling her a wetback to her face . <p> " Inez , hey , how are you ? How 's my father ? " <p> " Oh , " she said , and then her voice caught . " That 's what I 'm calling you about . I 'm so sorry to have to tell you this news . Your father 's dead , Leo . I 'm so sorry . " <p> " He 's dead ? " Spivak 's heart leapt , and then , immediately ashamed of itself , it plunged back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died ? Oh , my gosh , no . When ? " <p> " Last night . I do n't know when . They did n't call until this morning . " <p> " Who ? The nursing home ? Tell me-what happened ? What did they say ? " <p> " He fell , " Inez said . " He slipped and hit his head . I do n't know , they did n't tell me too much . They asked me to call you . I told them I did n't want to do it , but they asked again . " <p> " He just hit his head and died ? " <p> " That 's what they told me . He 's gone , Leo . He 's gone . " She was crying now , this old woman-her voice sounded thin and silly to him , suddenly soaked with tears , as though she 'd stepped off a ledge into deep water . <p> " How did you find me at this number ? " Spivak asked . As soon as he 'd said it he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't help himself : he was curious . <p> " Oh , I called your house , " Inez told him . " I spoke to your house sitter ? " <p> " Okay , well , I 'm glad you called , " he said , though that was , of course , a lie . " Sit tight , Inez . I 'll handle everything . " <p> " Do you want me to arrange for a funeral announcement ? In the newspaper ? " <p> " Oh , gee . Yeah . Good idea-go ahead and do that . Sure . That 'd be great : ' <p> " What should I say ? About your dad , I mean ? For the announcement ? " <p> " What should you say ? " Spivak asked . " I do n't know . " His mind was completely blank . " You knew him . Just say whatever you want . You can make something up . " <p> Over Spivak 's objections , Rachel came along with him on the drive from Mendocino to San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , in the name of God , she asked him , would she have wanted to stay in Mendocino by herself ? But once they 'd arrived in Tucson and had checked into their motel , Spivak announced his firm intention to take care of all the details of his father 's personal effects and funeral arrangements by himself . " You did n't even like him , " he reminded her . " I did n't like him , either , but he 's my father , so I 'm obligated . " <p> " I 'm your wife-I 'm obligated , too . " <p> " Absolutely not . It 's out of the question . Stay right here , " he told her . " Go swimming-they 've got a great pool here . Work on your tan , read a book . I do n't want to hear about you doing anything but relaxing . And whatever you do , do n't try to get involved in this funeral thing . We 're on vacation . We did n't go on vacation because my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that does n't mean our vacation is over . " <p> " You 're not making any sense . Come on . This is your father we 're talking about . " <p> " We 've waited for this vacation for two years . I 'm not going to have it ruined , and that 's that . It 's not Mendocino , but at least there 's a pool and the sun is shining . Okay , so it 's a hundred and eight degrees and there 's no ocean . But shut your eyes , use your imagination , you 're right back in California . Smell that surf . Just work on your tan and practice your backstroke , and let me handle this my way , okay ? " <p> So while Rachel lounged nervously by the pool at the Marriott , daubing sunblock on her shoulders every five minutes , Spivak , his face set in a grim mask , drove to Desert Angels , his father 's nursing home . He stood impatiently in the reception lounge , waiting as the woman behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later she thrust a clipboard full of documents at him . " We 're all going to miss your father , " she said , her voice full of cheery compassion . " He was such a lively , lively guy . You can fill these out over there . " She pointed to a nearby couch . <p> There was no denying it : the place smelled frankly of urine . Near the door , an old woman sat in a wheelchair , her head sunk so low that her whiskered chin nearly rested on her chest . Her eyes were open , but she seemed to be staring at nothing . She was nodding her head slightly and grunting , making a sound that resembled " uh-huh " - like some sort of relentless , monotonal benediction . Lively , Spivak said to himself , rolling his eyes as he filled out forms . Lively compared to what ? <p> From where he sat , he could see into the dining room : a morbidly obese woman stood at a lectern reading bingo numbers into a microphone , while a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheelchairs , some of them hooked to oxygen tanks . Attendants stood by , helping the residents keep track of their progress . " Bingo ! " a male attendant said in a loud voice . Somewhere down the hall , someone was screaming . <p> He handed the clipboard back to the receptionist , who said , " Just sign this release form and you can take your father 's personal papers : ' Spivak scribbled his signature , and she handed him a manila envelope , which he immediately ripped open . Inside were his father 's honorable discharge from the Army , a copy of his Social Security card , fourteen dollars , and a typed and notarized Last Will and Testament . The will was worthless ; his father had scrawled his own name on both of the lines reserved for witnesses ' signatures . Spivak stuffed it back into the envelope and shoved the whole thing into the hip pocket of his shorts . <p> " Before I go , " he said , " would there be anyone available who could talk to me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some sort of closure ? I 'm kind of curious about his death . To be perfectly honest with you , I 'd sort of convinced myself he 'd live forever . " <p> " Of course , " she said , and bit her lip . " Just have a seat and I 'll get your father 's nurse . " <p> In a moment a large woman with masculine features appeared and sat next to him . " You 're Mr. Spivak 's son ? " she said . " I 'm Mrs. Mitchell . I stopped in to see your father almost every day . He talked about you all the time . Leo this and Leo that . He was very proud " <p> " Well , thank you . That 's very nice to hear . " <p> " You wanted to know about your father 's death , " Mrs. Mitchell said . Her eyes narrowed . " Your father slipped and hit his head . " Mrs. Mitchell coughed into her hand . " He 'd had an accident , and the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spivak echoed , and nodded thoughtfully . <p> " Yes . This may be painful , Mr. Spivak . He'd-lost control of his bowels . " She saw the look on Spivak 's face , and quickly added , " That 's not at all unusual among our patients . It happens every day . Apparently he was trying to get to the bathroom . " She coughed again . <p> " You mean my father slipped in his own- ? " <p> " Yes . That 's right . " She looked away for a moment , and knotted a handkerchief in her lap . " A fall like that . . . internal bleeding , cerebral hemorrhage . " She shrugged . " Your father had n't been well , you know . He was frail . He 'd fallen a number of times in recent months . You have to understand , Mr. Spivak , we have a hundred and sixty residents here at Desert Angels . Orderlies were on their way to his room when the accident occurred . We try to respond to all incidents like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button and it could n't have been even five minutes later when we got there . We 're all very sorry . " <p> " He slipped in his own shit , " Spivak said , his voice soft and full of awe . " Gee , that 's really something . " He stood up and shook her hand limply , then walked away . <p> Outside , the heat was like a brick wall . He walked through it bent over , trying to avoid the glare of the sun . As he crossed the parking lot he felt the pavement sucking at the soles of his shoes . He tried to remember what his rental car looked like , but all he could think of was the phrase He slipped in his own shit , which echoed in his head like a dull gong . There it was , the rental car , a deep maroon something-or-other . All he knew about it was that the air-conditioning worked . What did people do out here , he wondered , before there was air-conditioning ? Probably nobody lived here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adobe huts stuck among the cacti and the scorpions . Probably people slipped in their own shit all the time , and nobody was there to clean it up except a few coyotes . <p> At his next stop , the Marshak Jewish Funeral Chapel on Orange Grove Road , he waited for nearly half an hour on a Roman bench in the cool , marble-floored lobby until Stan Marshak , the funeral director , was free . A receptionist brought Spivak a cup of weak coffee , which he sipped while he listened to the dim sounds of weeping that came from behind the handsome mahogany door of Marshak 's office . He stared at a large stainless steel sculpture which hung on the wall across the lobby , and realized after a few minutes that it was supposed to be a menorah . Finally the door to Marshak 's office opened , and a huddled family group walked out , gripping each other and sniffling . <p> Marshak came out behind them , wringing his hands . He was a tall , spare man dressed in an expensive-looking black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his head cocked to the side . " Stan Marshak . So sorry for your loss . " He clasped his hands at his throat and stood frozen there for a moment , remorse dripping down over his long , ravaged face . Then the moment passed , and he waved Spivak wearily into his office , which was festooned along its paneled walls with framed certificates of merit from various Jewish organizations . <p> " Well , I 've gone through our records , and the good news , Mr. Spivak , is that your father provided for everything , " Marshak began . He let the word " everything " slip through his lips in separate , breathy syllables , as if Spivak 's father had shown shocking , unprecedented foresight-the first person in recorded history to ever prepay a funeral . <p> " Is that right , " Spivak said . <p> " Absolutely . " He flipped through a pile of paperwork . " Yes , here it is . Just look at this , will you ? " He shoved the papers across the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's his signature : ' He tapped a finger on the top sheet . " Everything 's paid for in advance . Your father did that several years ago . Burial plot-he even picked out a casket . Will you look at that . Very considerate , indeed . " He shook his head and tsked . <p> " Well , that 's good news . I 'm relieved-and frankly surprised , I have to tell you . My father was n't usually one to think ahead . " <p> " Well , you can relax , because everything 's been taken care of . Except of course for my fees , and for a few other odds and ends . Your father was orthodox , was he not ? " <p> " My dad ? Oh , no . I do n't even think he belonged to a synagogue , as a matter of fact . " <p> " Are you yourself a practicing Jew ? " <p> " No , not really . I mean . . . no . But I know he 'd like to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , " Marshak said . " I understand perfectly . We 'll make sure everything is done strictly according to Jewish law . So for starters , then , there will be the additional fee to have the body watched until the funeral . That 's traditional . Then there 'll be the ritual washing and wrapping in a shroud-again , it 's traditional . And then there will be the rabbi 's honorarium . Traditionally , five hundred is suggested . The cost of the casket has gone up , of course , since your father made his arrangements . Everything 's gone up-up-up . The cost of fine woods like mahogany- " <p> " Wait a second . I thought in orthodox funerals the casket was just a pine box . " <p> Marshak looked up at him under lavish snow-white eyebrows and held the pose for several beats . " Yes . Well . If you 'd like to go that route . " <p> " Is n't that traditional ? " <p> " Your father prepaid the cost of a fine polished mahogany casket . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , are you not ? " <p> " Yes , I am . <p> " Well , of course you 're free to do what you 'd like . These were your father 's wishes , but- " <p> " What are we talking about , in terms of price difference ? Roughly , I mean . " <p> " Between the pine and the mahogany ? About five hundred dollars . " <p> Spivak sat back in his seat . " Are you absolutely sure my father wanted the mahogany ? " <p> " Oh , yes . It 's right here in black and white . " <p> " Well , that 's a mistake . I bet he just circled the wrong box or something . All my life I 've heard that Jews get buried in plain pine caskets . I 've always admired that , you know ? It seems so much more sensible than something fancy . Goyim go crazy with their polished caskets and open viewing of the dead and all of that . It 's disgusting . Who 'd want anything like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the plain pine ? Is that it ? " <p> " Yes . That 's definite . Let 's go with the pine . " <p> Marshak cocked his head and pursed his lips as he jotted a note of his pad . Then , not bothering to look up , he said , " Fine and dandy . Let 's just do a little figuring here , shall we ? " At that , he fell into a five-minute frenzy of calculations , scribbling furiously on a pad , muttering to himself , transposing figures onto other sheets of paper , pounding out nervous , staccato rhythms on an adding machine . Finally he rested , and leaned back into the plush leather cushion of his chair . " Well , are you lucky , " he said , shaking his head in admiration . " Is n't this something . " <p> " Oh , yeah ? " <p> " Just look at how this has worked out , " Marshak announced , and pushed a ruled pad of paper under Spivak 's nose . " Now first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my own fee-we call it our Out of Towner Special . It 's a little something we like to do here at Marshak-so many of our bereaved are from out of the area . Then you 'll notice that I 've waived the traditional fee for having the body watched until burial . That one 's on the house ' ! But wait , this is the nicest part-you 'll notice the fifteen- percent deduction off the standard rabbi 's honorarium . A perfectly fine , highly qualified rabbi I happen to know here in Tucson , unaffiliated with any congregation at the present time , looking for a few extra functions to perform . And will you just look at those savings ! " He beamed and stroked his wrists , which were long and bony and matted with dark hair , like a chimpanzee 's wrists . <p> The total came to nearly two thousand dollars over the amount his father had already paid . Spivak stared at it . " Did you figure in the savings on the casket ? " he asked sharply . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No , you did n't . Jesus , that 's a lot of money . I thought you said it was all paid for . I thought you said my father had thought of everything . " <p> " And he did , he certainly did , Mr. Spivak . Except for the items we 've just discussed . " <p> When he got back to the motel he found Rachel out by the pool and stood sweating over her , blocking the sun , describing to her the manner of his father 's death . " I mean , tell me , is that death with dignity ? " he asked her . " Is that any way to exit this sphere- this plane of existence ? Slipping in your own excrement ? Is that a way to die ? " <p> " No , it 's not , Leo . It 's awful , " Rachel replied . She adjusted her sunglasses . " I 'm really sorry . I wish you would 've let me come along with you . I really wanted to . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why ? What good would that have done ? What would it have changed ? If you 'd been there , you think they would have said he died peacefully in his sleep , listening to Mozart ? " <p> " That 's not what I meant . " Rachel shaded her eyes and gazed up at him . " It 's awful , honey . They should n't have told you . What 's the point in knowing that ? " <p> " I do n't know . Listen , the funeral 's tomorrow , and I do n't want you to come . That 's absolute . This is my job-he was my father , and it 's my responsibility . You 're on vacation , I want you to go buy some jewelry or something-maybe something turquoise . Go have a massage or a facial . Pretend you 're still in Mendocino . " He thought of telling her about the issue of the pine casket , but then decided not to bring it up . What if she told him she would have voted for mahogany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachel asked . " You look awful . " <p> " Well , I 'm hot . We 're in Tucson , it 's summertime . This weather really takes it out of a person . I wish we were back in Mendocino . " <p> " No , I mean-you know . " <p> " Listen , this is my version of grieving . I know it 's not the way I 'm supposed to be acting , but I ca n't help it . My dad lived for eighty-five years and now he 's dead . Period , end of sentence . And get this : the funeral 's going to cost me two thousand dollars . Can you believe that ? I do n't want to be a bastard about this , but my God , that 's a lot of money just to put somebody in the ground . " He wiped his cheek . " That 's sweat , by the way , " he said . " I 'm not crying . I 'm sweating to death . " He paused . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near that funeral . " <p> This was the same motel he and Rachel had stayed in fifteen years before , on their first trip to Arizona . In the wake of Spivak 's mother 's death , his father at the age of seventy had suddenly gone haywire , quitting his job selling children 's clothing and moving to Tucson from Kansas City . " I 'm tired , " he told them . " I 'm sick of the ice and snow , I 'm getting the hell out of there . " He had next to nothing in the bank , no pension at all , just his pathetic Social Security and the pittance he 'd gained from the quick sale of the house . Alone and friendless in the desert , baking in the sun , over the next couple of months he called Spivak every day or two- mournful , remorse-laden conversations which seemed designed to elicit sympathy and money from his son . Then the phone calls petered out , and when Spivak called to check up on his father in Tucson after a silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He drawled like a cowboy , spoke of needing to " go get some grub , " answered Spivak 's questions with " yup " or " nope . <p> Spivak stewed over this new development for another month , his anxiety mounting , then finally he could n't take it anymore . " We 've got to go down there and make sure he 's okay , " he told Rachel . " He 's my father-I ca n't stand him , it 's true-I 've never been able to stand him , even when I was a kid-but now he 's the only parent I 've got left , and he 's turning into Gabby Hayes . " So just after St. Patrick 's Day , when old drifts of brown-crusted snow were still heaped in the alley behind their house in Winnetka , Spivak and Rachel parked their infant daughter , Elena , with Rachel 's parents , the Sperlings ( who had flown to Chicago just to babysit ) , and went down to visit the old man in Arizona for three days . <p> When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the air was rich and fragrant with desert flowers , the sunshine so bright it hurt their eyes . The elder Spivak , his face as pink as scar tissue , clomped up to greet them in cowboy boots . He wore a shirt decorated with gold piping and brass studs ; low-slug jeans hung beneath his belly , held up by a belt with an enormous silver- and-turquoise buckle , and a well-aged straw cowboy hat rode askew atop his freckled bald skull . " Howdy there , " he announced in the same twang that Spivak had heard over the phone . <p> " Dad ? " Spivak asked . He peered at his father carefully . <p> " Y'all hungry ? " his father asked . " Let 's mosey on over to the Steak Stampede-I could eat me a hoss . " At the restaurant , while they were waiting for their food to come , Spivak and Rachel trotted out their pictures of Elena , but his father fanned through them disinterestedly , then shuffled them as if they were a deck of playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After they 'd finished their lunch and the plates had been cleared away , the elder Spivak leaned back into his seat , sucking on a toothpick , and regaled them with stories of old time Tucson , his twang growing more noticeable with every sentence . Finally he suggested they all might attend a rodeo that afternoon . " More fun than a barrel of monkeys , " he told them . <p> " We 're not going to any rodeos , Dad . That 's out of the question . Look , what 's going on ? " Spivak demanded . " What 's with that hat ! " <p> " Keeps the sun off my head , " his father said , shifting his gaze to the floor . " Lotta sun out these parts . Man 's got to take precautions . " <p> " Listen to the way you 're talking . These parts . ' What 's got into you ? You think you 're a cowboy ? Well , hello-reality check .

She was a good woman . The best I ever knew . " <p> " You do n't have to tell me that . I know she was a good woman . She was my mother . " <p> Spivak 's father turned his gaze to Rachel . " We lived our whole lives for him-for his happiness , " he said , pointing at Spivak . " Leo wanted something , he got it . We made sure he never lacked a thing . We may not have had the fanciest house on the block , but- " <p> " What 's that got to do with anything , " Spivak said disgustedly , and shook his head . He 'd heard this spiel before , and so what if it was true , or nearly true ? It was ancient history ! What was he supposed to do , hang himself out of guilt , just because he 'd had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : at one time , many sacrifices had been made on his behalf . This had all occurred during his childhood , when he was a child , for Christ 's sake , and had n't noticed any of it ; he 'd been too busy watching stupid television shows , playing Capture the Flag and King of the Hill , building model airplanes , blowing holes in the yard with illegally obtained firecrackers , camping out at the neighbors ' house , getting sick on candy-he 'd been masturbating and learning to ride a bicycle by falling off it repeatedly , hoarding Mad magazines and pretending he was James Bond , masturbating some more-and so he had n't had time to keep a running tally of all the things his parents had done without on his account . So okay , already !

Why ? " Spivak shook his head . " What 's wrong with the Jewish Community Center ? Join the temple , or something . Join B'Nai Brith , why do n't you ? " <p> " Listen to you . What are you , Mr. Jewish Culture all of a sudden ? " <p> " I just thought you might like to join a temple , that 's all . It 's a place to meet people . They 've got temples out here .

Take my word for it , ladies out here line up to get the chance to foxtrot with Sol Spivak . Widows are crazy about me . Look at me : I 'm clean , I take a shower every day , I walk a mile every day at the mall , I do my own laundry , I iron my own shirts . I get hungry , I heat up a Swanson TV dinner . You want to stay back there with all that snow every winter ? So stay . I want to live out the rest of my life in the sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuing fifteen years had passed , first one widow and then another , sometimes several of them at once accompanying Sol Spivak to the Elks dances . Spivak had met a few of them over the years during his brief trips to the desert to visit his father ; though he fought the impulse , he could n't help comparing them to his mother , and inevitably found each of them wanting-some were stupid , others bitter and cynical . All of them struck him as desperate : corseted , pinched into outfits too small for them , their faces daubed with makeup , their hair dyed a spectrum of unlikely colors . Still , it was a mystery to him that they put up with his father , who seemed to have decided to use his advancing years as an excuse to seek the worst inside himself-to let go of the rope that held us tied , no matter how loosely , to the pier of decency and respectability . He lied incessantly . He shoplifted until he was caught and given a suspended sentence . He grew a Fu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ran up thousands of dollars on his credit cards and then called Spivak in tears , begging him to pay off his debts . He bought a hairpiece that looked like it was made of yak fur , and insisted on wearing it backwards . He cheated relentlessly on every woman he met , then cried and fumed and cursed them when they left him because of it . <p> But gradually as the years had gone by , his father 's health had failed ; the sun slowly turned his skin to burnt parchment , the heat sapped his strength so that nine months out of the year he hardly saw the outdoors at all ; his dancing turned to feeble shuffling and then stopped altogether , and in its place the elder Spivak turned to the daytime TV talk shows for entertainment . The yak- fur hairpiece and the fake gold chains sat on the coffee table in front of the couch , gathering dust . His personal habits grew shabby . For days at a time he would eat nothing but crackers and peanut butter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his bowels in the shower , and each time called his son to tearfully confess what had happened . <p> Along the way , of course , the parade of widows thinned out , until finally over the last couple of years there 'd been only Inez , who put up with Sol Spivak through seasons of discontent , as he moved bitterly from one cramped , fetid apartment to another . They saw each other at least once a week , when she drove them to a restaurant for an early bird special dinner ( he 'd finally given up his driver 's license at the age of eighty-one , after creaming a public bus broadside in the middle of the afternoon ) . Inez called Spivak to complain to him about his father every six months or so . " All my friends tell me , they say , Inez , what are you doing with that man ? He 's no good , he 's mean to you , " ' she would moan to Spivak . " And so I tell them , Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , he 's too mean . ' He 's so mean , Leo . What made your dad so mean ?

I like him . I do n't know why , but I do . " <p> Finally , incapable of bathing himself without falling in the tub , unable to keep himself clean or make any of his own meals anymore , his ever-growing array of medicines a bewildering maze to him now , the elder Spivak put up at Desert Angels , a nursing home in the foothills of the mountains on Tucson 's northern edge , where for the last year and a half he 'd proceeded to go kicking and screaming down the final hallway of his life , making life hell for the staff of nurses and orderlies as he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Spivak went down for a dip in the motel pool with Rachel before breakfast-the one time all day when it was truly comfortable outside-and it was only when he was back in their room toweling off after his swim that he realized he 'd brought nothing even remotely appropriate for a funeral with him . Look at him : he did n't even have a belt with him , for God 's sake . To hell with ithe was n't going to go out and buy anything at this point . Why should he ? Already they were two thousand dollars in the hole- not to mention airfare for the two of them to Arizona , plus the cost of this motel , plus the rental car , and do n't forget the cost of the car and the vacation cottage in Mendocino , all of it nonrefundable , money down the drain . <p> The best he could come up with was a clean pair of hiking shorts and a yellow knit shirt with a little polo pony over his left nipple . He put these on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think ? " he asked Rachel . <p> " Oh , " she said with a sympathetic frown , and put her hands on his shoulders . " Well , what could you do , Leo ? " asked Rachel . " We were in Mendocino when you got the call . What were you supposed to do , after all , go buy a suit on your way to the airport ? " <p> " Yes , " Spivak muttered , and gathered his wallet and keys . <p> On the way to Marshak 's Funeral Chapel he tried half-heartedly to recall the prayers he 'd learned as a boy , but all he could dredge up were tattered fragments , a shred or two of melody , a few unintelligible syllables . Well , who was he kidding ? He 'd just have to admit it to the rabbi right up front-there 'd be nobody saying kaddish , nobody lighting any yartzheit candles , nobody laying any tefillin , nobody attending services to honor Sol Spivak 's name . The plain fact , Spivak told himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been a bad Jew , even as a child , when at his mother 's behest he 'd suffered through several years of Hebrew school in preparation for his bar mitzvah . Nothing the rabbis told him meant a damned thing ; it all seemed about as profound as a game of tiddlywinks , in fact , and though he recognized that he should be ashamed to feel this way , he was n't . This was Spivak 's sense of his destiny , his lineage : though he had nothing solid to back it up , no hard genealogical evidence per se , he felt sure in his heart that he was descended from a long line of bad Jews , an age- old dynasty of skeptics and know-nothings , eaters of treyf , nosethumbers and back-row snickerers , dregs and dropouts , stretching back through centuries of squalid tenement flats and mud-andstraw-hut shtetls , tattered tents in the middle of goddamned nowhere , all the way back to the golden calf itself . <p> Marshak was waiting for him in his office , dressed in a suit even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before . He gave Spivak a quick deadpan head-to-toe glance , then raised his eyebrows and inhaled through his nose . <p> " I 'm sorry . I did n't bring any funeral clothes with me . I know it 's inappropriate . I was on vacation with my wife in California when I heard about my father 's death , and this is the best I could do , " Spivak said . He crossed his arms on his chest to hide the polo pony . " I was in Mendocino , " he said , and then added , " It 's gorgeous there . " <p> " Yes , I 'm sure it is , " Marshak said . " Was your wife unable to accompany you ? I thought I understood you to say yesterday- " " She 's back at the motel . I told her to relax , " Spivak said . " It 's so damn hot out , you know ? Anyway , she hardly knew my father . We 're not exactly a close-knit family . " <p> Marshak gazed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on the verge of a comment of some kind when a knock sounded at the door . He opened it , admitting a florid , pudgy man with receding red hair . " Ah , yes . Perfect . Mr. Spivak , " Marshak announced , twirling his long , bony hands around , " may I present Rabbi Evelyn Fink . " <p> Spivak shook the rabbi 's hand . <p> " Not a word about my name , okay ? " the rabbi said quickly . He flashed a brief , mirthless smile . " Sorry , I always say that-it 's a preemptive strike . " Marshak excused himself and left the room , rubbing his hands together as if it had suddenly turned cold in his office . Spivak and Rabbi Fink sat down in slippery leather chairs . " Forgive me , Mr. Spivak . I know you 're in mourning and all . I 'm just very sensitive about my name , " Rabbi Fink said . " I 've had a rough life . I 'm awfully sorry for your loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service for your father . I did n't know him at all , so I 'll need to ask you some questions in order to prepare a few remarks in the way of a eulogy " He took out a pen and a scrap of paper . <p> " Ask away . " <p> " What was he like ? " <p> " He was a jerk : ' <p> Rabbi Fink laughed nervously . " Well , well , " he said , and clicked the pen a few times . <p> " You asked : ' <p> " Yes , indeed . How old was your father at the time of his death ? " <p> " Eighty-five . He was born in Lithuania . He always claimed that he could n't remember the name of the town . But my guess is , he just did n't want to think about it . " <p> " And how long had he lived in this country ? " <p> " Seventy-three years . He lived in New York originally , got his start in the garment industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born in Kansas City , Missouri . Now I live in Chicago-Winnetka , actually . It 's on the North Shore . My wife and I have a daughter , Elena . That 's some name , is n't it ? She 's sixteen . At tennis camp up in Wisconsin-Camp KeeTonKee . ' He leaned forward and before he could stop himself he added , " She 's spending money up there like you would n't believe . How much can a can of tennis balls cost ? You know what I mean ? I think she 's putting most of it up her nose , to tell you the truth . My wife 's in deep denial about all of this . Cocaine ? Not our daughter ! ' Oh , yeah : ' <p> " Okay . Right , " Rabbi Fink said , though his eyes were wide . " Is n't that something . Now , about your father , for just a minute . . . what was his line of work ? " <p> " He sold children 's clothing , wholesale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't enjoy it very much , and so he did n't do very well at it , to be honest . When you do n't enjoy what you 're doing . . . well , you know . But anyway , it was a living : ' <p> " And his hobbies ? " <p> " My father did n't have hobbies . Well , wait a second . When I was a kid he liked to watch the Friday night fights , the Gillette fights , on television . He 'd sit in the den and have a beer and let me take sips from it . He liked to dance , too , although I did n't know that about him until after my mother died . She died of cancer fifteen years ago . They were married forty-two years . It was n't a great marriage , but it was very long . " <p> " I understand , " Rabbi Fink said , drawing big , nervous circles on the scrap of paper . <p> " No , I do n't think you do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really was n't all that great a father . He was gone a lot , and that was bad , but what was worse was that when he 'd come home from a trip , he was usually in a rotten mood , because he was n't earning a lot of commissions , since he really did n't have much of a gift for sales-and he 'd say stuff that really hurt my feelings . He called me a little creep once , when I was about ten . I ca n't remember why he did it . Nobody 'd ever called me a creep before , and to hear that from your own father-well , it was very depressing . Another time , I broke a window with a tennis ball and I could n't get it fixed before he got home-I was maybe eight or nine-and when he saw it , he told me I was n't his son anymore . I cried for days . " <p> Rabbi Fink ran his tongue around over his top front teeth , as if rooting around for the remains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'm really very sorry . " <p> " Oh , that 's okay . I survived . " Spivak fell silent , and sank back into his chair . <p> " Is there anything you 'd like to add-anything about your father you 'd like me to know ? " <p> " No . I do n't think so . I mean , I do n't want to sound abrupt , but he lived for eighty-five years , and then he died . You know ? He was n't exactly cut off in his prime . " <p> " All right , then . " Rabbi Fink pulled an embroidered yarmulke out of his pocket and clapped it on his head . " I have a confession to make , " he said , wringing his hands . " You opened up to me a bit just a minute ago , so I feel like I can tell you this . This is my first funeral . I 'm a little nervous . I 've been a rabbi for twelve years , and it 's been tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fist into his palm . " You think your father hated his work ? Well , talk to me about on-the-job frustration . I 've never caught on . I do n't know why . I 'll get a three-week tryout at a congregation , and at the end of three weeks they pat me on the shoulder and show me the door . I 've been everywhere . You want to know what it 's like being a rabbi in Sitka , Alaska ? I did three weeks there . I think it 's my name , you know ? They hear the name , Evelyn Fink-boom , they 're against me . Evelyn , what is that , a girl 's name ? ' Fink , hey , Rat Fink , Rabbi Rat Fink ! ' Ha , ha . Everybody 's such a comedian : ' <p> " I 'm sorry to hear that . Do n't worry about the funeral . It should be a snap , " Spivak said . " Nobody 's going to show up , anyway . The notice was just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend Inez , I do n't think anybody in Tucson was still speaking to my dad . He was a hard guy to like . And as for a eulogy , you do n't have to say too much . Just say he lived a long time and now he 's dead , and that ought to do the trick . " <p> " Well , thanks . You 're holding up very well under the strain of your loss , I must say . I have n't spent a lot of time around bereaved families , so what do I know about it ? But you seem like you 're doing great so far , in the grief department , I mean . I suppose it 's because you did n't have a very deep or meaningful relationship with your father , anyway . " <p> Spivak bristled , sensing that his capacity for feeling had been called into question . Meaningful ? Who 'd said anything about deep or meaningful ? " We all grieve in our own way , Rabbi , " he said , then he shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was talking about . What did he know about grieving , anyway ? Oh , sure , he 'd felt a terrible loss when his mother died-for months afterward he thought of calling her every Sunday , as had been his habit , but then each time he realized she was gone , and he 'd have to talk to his father instead , he hung up the phone and sat by it , lost and utterly bereft , tears welling up in his eyes . He 'd liked his mother , had even admired her , to the very end . She was a woman of true faith , and while Spivak did n't understand faith , and did n't respect it very much , either , he admired it in his mother , because he saw that it gave her a cushion , something firm and comfortable to lean against in her final days when the pain grew intense , and it let her die with something akin to dignity . <p> This , on the other hand , was something altogether different . As hard as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to his father 's death , all Spivak could think of was the fact that from now on he would n't have to send the old guy any more money . For years he 'd been sending his father dribbling amounts , a hundred one month , two hundred the next . It was n't the money itself that bothered him , he told himself . But then he asked himself : what kind of bullshit was that ? Of course it was the money . After all these years toiling away at Bowles and Humphries , his salary was still stuck in the high five figures-unlike other guys his age , like Adelman in Media , Kinsella in Accounting , and the Bobbsey Twins , Bob Luther and Bob Delgado from Creative , all of whom were vice presidents already , stockholders in the firm . Christmas rolled around , these guys got smacked with bonus checks that had Mercedes written all over them . But not Spivak- no , never Spivak , no bonus checks for him . God , it would feel good to stop writing those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start saving for something . He did n't know what , just yet-but he could figure that out later . There must be something out there that was worth having . <p> Marshak tapped on the office door and then a moment later opened it a crack . " May I intrude ? " he asked in an unctuous voice . <p> " I think we 're done in here , " Rabbi Fink said . He stood up and put a serious , businesslike expression on his face . " Thank you for your candor , Mr. Spivak . I 'm sure you loved and honored your father , and I know you revere his memory . I 'll do my very best to convey all of that in my remarks . " <p> " Mr. Spivak ? " Marshak said softly , in a voice full of steely tenderness . " I 'm sorry to seem abrupt , but we have another service scheduled for this afternoon . Please-this way . I 'll show you the family viewing room . " <p> The viewing room turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapel . Through a gap in the curtains , Spivak could see his father 's casket up on a platform at the front of the chapel , near a lectern . The casket looked pretty nice , considering that it was a plain pine coffin and obviously cost five hundred dollars less than the one his father had ordered . The wood was as pale as cream , and the casket 's contours were smooth and rounded ; clearly it had been built with genuine skill and care . But still , there was no denying it : this thing did n't pack the wallop of a polished mahogany casket glinting under the lights . There might as well have been a large price tag on it , $500 LESS THAN THE MAHOGANY ! scrawled in bold red letters . <p> Spivak peeked out a little farther to see if there were any mourners . Surprisingly , a group of them sat there , a sorrow-beaten band of arthritic old cockers his father had called his friends . In addition to Inez , there were elderly women in attendance as well-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past years . The duffers were a fragile , shabby bunch , just as decrepit as his father had been of late . They were tieless , dressed in soiled double-knit outfits , their shirt collars out over their jacket lapels in the style of Israeli Knesset members . One of them had fallen noisily asleep , his mouth open , his dentures slipping out . The widows were sitting in furious , hennaed , clench-jawed isolation , each one occupying her own separate row . How had these people managed to learn of his father 's death in time to come here ? They must grab the early papers every morning and search the obituaries for familiar names . Maybe they hoped a buffet would be included . <p> Inez sat by herself in the front row , her bowed head covered in a doily . She was a plain woman with a rough , battered face . She was weeping now ; he could tell by the jerky way her shoulders moved . <p> " Listen , do I have to stay in here by myself ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a curtain at all of these people . My father 's friend Inez is out there . " <p> " It 's traditional , " Marshak replied , and handed Spivak a black yarmulke . <p> " No , I mean , do I have to ? Is it required ? Is it in the Bible or something ? Thou shalt peek through a curtain at thy father 's funeral ? " <p> Marshak sniffed . " Of course not . As with everything else , it 's your decision . " <p> " Well , fine , then , " Spivak said . He slipped out through the curtain and sat down by Inez . <p> Rabbi Fink opened the service nervously with a hymn that Spivak did n't recognize . It might have been a soothing melody , but Fink 's voice cracked several times as he sang , and at one point it seemed he might be on the verge of tears . Spivak sensed that his father 's cronies were staring at him from the pews farther back in the chapel-he could feel their rheumy eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could n't stop gazing at his father 's casket . The casket seemed very big for such a little guy ; his father had n't stood much over five-six , and in the last few years he 'd lost weight , shriveling like a piece of rotten fruit . Inside that box lay the already-moldering remains of the man whose lap he 'd slept in occasionally as a small boy-the man who had taught him the ins and outs of manhood , starting with how to pee standing up . Once upon a time they 'd played catch together in the front yard night after night , pegging the ball back and forth under the oak tree for hours , until they were called in for dinner or it grew too dark to see . In the years before baseball games were regularly televised , Spivak and his father would sit together on the couch listening to the old Kansas City A 's on the radio , eating peanuts and mocking the anemic voice of Monte Moore , the team 's dipshit announcer . Sunday mornings in summertime , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other with the hose . When Spivak was fifteen and developed a mustache , his father showed him how to shave , standing behind him at the bathroom sink while Spivak 's mother wept in the doorway . He realized now as he stared as his father 's casket that he might be embellishing some of this stuff , blowing an isolated incident into something grander , more enduring-but still , he could n't be making it all up from thin air . <p> When Rabbi Fink was done singing the opening hymn , he gripped the podium and stared in wide-eyed wonder at the audience of mourners , as if he 'd just realized they were there . " What can I tell you about Sol Spivak that you do n't already know ? " he asked . " What , finally , is there to say about such a man ? " He slipped a hand into his coat pocket and withdrew a scrap of paper , which he now consulted . " That he was from Lithuania , came to this country as a young man , moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That he was retired , a single man , a widower ? You knew all of that . That for many years he made his living , such as it was , selling children 's clothes ? You knew that , too , I 'm sure . And anyway , what does it matter ? He was n't that good as a salesman , and his career 's been over a long time : ' Inez , who 'd already been weeping gently , now burst into tears that seemed ready to tear her to pieces . " He was a simple man , Sol Spivak , " Rabbi Fink continued . " Not a good man-no , let 's not kid ourselves , not a hero . He was n't a saint-far from it , in fact . He said things he should n't have said , did things he should n't have done . And now he 's gone . " He crumpled the scrap of paper and shoved it back into his pocket . " There will be no plaques in this man 's honor . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one will send their child to college on a Sol Spivak scholarship . " <p> " Christ almighty , " one of the duffers in the rows behind Spivak muttered , " what the hell kind of a eulogy is this ? Who is this rabbi , anyway ? What 's his name again ? " <p> " It 's a common story , is n't it ? Ashes to ashes , dust to dust , " Rabbi Fink continued , pounding the podium to emphasize his points . " Whoever heard of Sol Spivak ? Nobody . What did he have to recommend himself ? Not very much . In a week we 'll all have forgotten him . " <p> Spivak could stand it no longer . " AND YET ! " he cried , rising to his feet as if bouncing off a trampoline . He stood stock-still for a moment in shock , his index finger pointed toward the ceiling as if to emphasize an upcoming rhetorical point . Rabbi Fink stared at him blankly . " And yet-he was an Elk ! " Spivak said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elk ! Is n't that remarkable ? Can you get a load of that ? He loved it-being an Elk , I mean-the dancing and all . I thought he was crazy , I really did-but he adored it . " <p> " Thank you , Leo , loving son of the deceased-thank you for sharing that with us , " Rabbi Fink said . He flashed a beaming , insincere smile at Spivak , and then opened his prayer book as if looking for the proper place to reenter the service . <p> " Wait a second . One more thing , and I 'll be finished , " Spivak said to the rabbi . " I 'm sorry , I should have mentioned this to you before , in the office . " He turned back to the audience of mourners in the chapel . " Give me just a second here . I think he wanted to be a lawyer when he was a kid . It did n't work out , but that was what he dreamed of when he was young . He told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his favorite food , but it had to be ice cold or he would n't eat it . He loved borscht with sour cream , too . And he had a weakness for pretzels . " <p> " Thank you very much , Leo . I 'm moved by what you 've said , and I 'm sure everyone here is moved , as well , " said Rabbi Fink . " And I 'm glad you felt able to speak up this way . " When he saw that Spivak had no immediate intention of stopping , the rabbi shut his prayer book , glanced briefly at his watch , and rolled his eyes . <p> " When I was a little boy we 'd go to the swimming pool at the Jewish Community Center and play a game called King of the Corner , " Spivak said . He inched toward the podium now , and rested a hand on it as he spoke . " It was my favorite game . My dad would get in the water at the shallow end and wedge himself into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around this lip of tile so he had a good grip , and I 'd try to pull on his legs to yank him out of that corner . He 'd kick and splash , and I 'd hang on to his legs and pull . He never seemed to get tired . We 'd go for hours , and then whenever I wanted to play King of the Corner again , he 'd always say okay . " <p> Rabbi Fink cleared his throat . " Mr. Spivak ? Are you finished now ? We should move along , " he said , and reached out a hand to caress Spivak 's shoulder . <p> " I wish I 'd remembered all of this earlier , " Spivak said . " I just thought they 'd want to know some of this stuff . Every year at Passover , " he began-then , when he felt Rabbi Fink 's fingers tighten slightly on his shoulder , he karate-chopped at them fiercely until they loosened their grip . " Every year at Passover , " Spivak began again , " my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra wineglass on the table for the prophet Elijah . He 'd tell me to keep my eye on the wineglass so I could watch Elijah come in and take a sip , and I 'd try to keep my eye on it-I mean I 'd watch it like a hawk-and somehow every year , every year without fail , at some point late in the seder after my attention had wandered , he 'd cry , Look , Leo ! ' and there it would be , Elijah 's wineglass , sitting there half-empty . It used to knock my socks off , every year . He did that for me , " he added . " He did n't believe in any of it . He did n't believe in a goddamn thing , but he did that for me . I do n't know why he did . I think he wanted me to believe in something . It did n't work , but at least he tried . " Spivak filled his lungs with air , and sighed out a deep breath . <p> At that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clapping his hands . " All right , everybody , " he announced , " let all who mourn this man rise now to recite the mourner 's kaddish . Up , up , up ! We 've got another service coming in at half past three , and we need to move forward , please . Let 's keep it going , please , and thank you very much ! " He glared at Spivak , then at Rabbi Fink . <p> Biting his lip , his head hung low and his cheeks stinging , Spivak resumed his place in the audience and stood with everyone else . He felt as if he were in kindergarten and had been caught poking Rabbi Fink in the ear with a crayon . It had been years since he 'd heard the kaddish-years , for that matter , since he 'd stepped foot inside a synagogue-but now as the meager , forlorn group of mourners began hesitantly to recite the words , the melody came back to him quite easily , and the words , as well : Yiskadahl , v'yiskadosh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bittersweet well of memory inside him-the same place he kept all the Top 40 love songs from his youth . Not so bad for a bad Jew , he told himself . He could hum along , at least , and that had to count for something . <p> Inez stood by his side , tears streaming down her rough cheeks , leaving black mascara tracks through her rouge . She was n't reciting the prayer ; even with the transliteration spelled out in English on the facing page , how could she hope to wrap her lips around these unfamiliar guttural phrases ? It must have sounded to her ears like a fitful effort to bring up phlegm . Spivak put a comforting arm around her shoulder and pulled her closer as he recited the kaddish . She pressed against him , and in a moment it seemed to him that she 'd melted into his side . <p> Although it was late afternoon , the drapes in their room were drawn when Spivak got back to the motel , and Rachel was deep asleep on the king-size bed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wake her up . <p> " I 'm back , " he said . " I 'm an orphan . " He sat down heavily at the edge of the bed . <p> " How was it ? " Rachel murmured . She rolled over and looked at him a moment , then switched on one of the bedside lamps . <p> " I do n't know . It was okay , " Spivak told her . He swung his legs up and lay back against the pillows , then he arranged his arms and legs just so , and stared up at the ceiling . " You were gone a long time , " she said in a tired voice . " I was worried . " <p> The telephone rang on the nightstand . <p> " Do n't answer it , " Spivak said sharply , and Rachel pulled her hand back from the phone . He watched her intently ; if she made a move for the phone , he was prepared to intercept her-to break her arm , if he had to . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called today and left a message for her to call . She 'll be worried . Let me just- " <p> " No , " Spivak said , and moved between Rachel and the phone . " No more phone calls . Let it ring . " <p> And so it rang . The intensity of his gaze softened ; he really wanted to tell Rachel about Rabbi Fink and that lame excuse for a eulogy , and about Marshak and his Out of Towner Special , and about Inez and the other widows and the miserable pack of joskies who 'd showed up in their polyester shmattes to mourn his father . Most of all he wanted to tell her about the pine casket and the five hundred dollars . <p> The phone kept ringing . " Leo ? " Rachel said , and put a hand on his arm . " Honey ? " <p> If he could just get the part about the casket off his chest , he thought there was a chance he might be able to breathe again . He could just blurt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rachel would tell him he 'd done the right thing , he was sure , and he would know she was lying , but he could deal with that part , he really could . The part he could n't deal with was that she 'd know that he 'd fucked up once again , and sometime soon he 'd catch her looking at him with that expression he 'd seen in her eyes before : Leo , Leo , why are you such a shmuck ? And anyway , what was he supposed to do about it now ? Was he supposed to exhume his father 's body and confess his sins ? Face it : the thing was over and done with . Finished . So why mention it to Rachel ? Why even bring it up ? What good could it possibly do ? <p> " Leo ? Speak to me , honey . C'm on , " Rachel said . The phone abruptly stopped ringing , leaving a metallic , echoing silence in the room . <p> No , Spivak told himself , there was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late . And there was no going back , no second chance , no rewinding the tape and getting to do it all again : it was going to stay too late forever . Now he could finally get on with the business of living the rest of his life . The only hard part would be learning to breathe with this goddamn weight on his rib cage . The rest of it was going to be a piece of cake . <p>
