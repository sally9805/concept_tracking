His colleagues are convinced that Jeffrey Ressner , TIME 's entertainment correspondent in Los Angeles , never sleeps . Ressner ranges tirelessly from the executive suites of Burbank and the sound stages of Culver City to the tables down at Mortons and Spago . He has knocked back rounds of tequila with Oliver Stone , strolled the wild streets of Amsterdam with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and watched as many as five movies in a day . " He 's the Jerry Rice of the Hollywood beat , " says Jordan Bonfante , chief of our Los Angeles bureau . " Like the San Francisco 49er wide receiver , he 'll catch anything that 's thrown at him . " <P> For this week 's profile of triple-threat comedy star Tim Allen , Ressner  --  along with correspondent Patrick Cole  --  carried the ball for a touchdown . " I went over to the set where Allen was readying a holiday episode of Home Improvement , and it felt friendly and homey , " says Ressner , " more like a Midwestern summer-stock rehearsal than the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Senior editor James Collins , who supervises TIME 's arts and entertainment coverage , was n't surprised by the unusual candor that Ressner drew from Allen during their interview . " Stars are asked so many questions by so many reporters , " says Collins , " that it takes someone with real intelligence and sympathy to get them to open up and say something honest and fresh . That 's one of Jeffrey 's great skills . " <P> Ressner , 37 , has sharpened his skills during a dozen years of covering show business . Raised in Springsteen country  --  Lakewood , New Jersey  --  he majored in film at Northwestern University , then caught the first flight to Los Angeles . From a starting job at L.A. Weekly , he rose to positions as senior writer at Rolling Stone and West Coast bureau chief at US magazine . Since he joined TIME a year and a half ago , his assignments have included the Paramount-Viacom deal , the O.J. Simpson case and Quentin Tarantino 's Pulp Fiction . <P> " I find the entertainment industry pretty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-styles , the can-you-top-this scandals , " says Ressner . " But I think what I enjoy most really is the talent of the artists . " One of Ressner 's own talents is the ability to work in the midst of self-generated cacophony . His office usually resounds to some combination of speakerphone , TV set , radio music and computer bells and other sound effects . Says Bonfante : " Occasionally a colleague with delicate acoustic sensitivities will softly close Jeffrey 's door . "
