<p> Anna Deavere Smith will be at stage center , and extreme voices on both sides of the racial divide will be heard , but this time , for a change , Ms. Smith will not be playing all the parts . The gifted actress , playwright and performance artist will moderate a debate between two real antagonists , the playwright August Wilson and the critic Robert Brustein , who will take to the stage on Monday night at 8 at Town Hall for a live version of the battle over race and cultural power they have been conducting in print for most of the last year . <p> Mr. Wilson , the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of such plays as " Fences " and " The Piano Lesson , " denounces society 's failure to support all-black theater companies , and argues that the values of the black community are compromised if black actors , directors and playwrights can only work within the structure of the mainstream , white-dominated theater . Mr. Brustein , the artistic director of the American Repertory Theater and the longtime theater critic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminds him of the arguments for black separatism that were heard in the 1960 's , and that it goes against the American tradition of integration . <p> In this corner , the new mosaic ; in that corner , the old melting pot . The angry black playwright representing the new forces of multiculturalism squares off against the curmudgeonly white critic defending the old liberal dream of integration . Two eloquent and driven men , refereed by a woman celebrated for the power of her performances on the subject of race . What better way for the theater to give new life to this issue than to present it as a piece of theater in itself ? <p> Any way you bill it , this is shaping up to be the sharpest cultural debate since the struggle over whether Robert Mapplethorpe was taking dirty pictures . That one led to questions about what kind of art the National Endowment for the Arts should be supporting and ultimately to sharp cutbacks in the Federal agency 's budget . This time the issue is n't whether the Federal Government has any business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to and every bit as strident as the social debate over multiculturalism  --  whether individual groups in society are better served by their own cultural outlets . <p> The struggle between the two men has galvanized the theater world for the better part of a year , ever since Mr. Wilson delivered a keynote address last June at the national conference of the Theater Communications Group , an umbrella organization of nonprofit theaters . Titled " The Ground on Which I Stand , " the speech was an impassioned call for a separate black theater , without which , Mr. Wilson contended , black actors and directors were participating only in " art that is conceived and designed to entertain white society . " <p> Mr. Wilson 's anger is fueled , at least in part , by the contention that of the 66 major companies solid enough to belong to the League of Resident Theaters , only one is black ; and that foundations and other supporters of black theater have chosen to put their money into increasing the presence of blacks in white-dominated theater organizations rather than into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounced one of liberalism 's prize achievements in the theater , the recent trend toward " nontraditional , " or colorblind , casting , which has opened up numerous employment opportunities for black actors . <p> " To mount an all-black production of a ' Death of a Salesman ' or any other play conceived for white actors is to deny us our own humanity , our own history , and the need to make our own investigations from the cultural ground on which we stand as black Americans , " Mr. Wilson stated . <p> Mr. Wilson went on to attack Mr. Brustein , who , as a longtime critic of multiculturalism , has often said that social goals have come to take precedence over purely artistic ones in financing of the contemporary arts . Mr. Brustein , for his part , says he views Mr. Wilson 's demands as a cultural version of affirmative action , and he fears that their acceptance would have the effect of lowering standards , much as critics of affirmative action assert that traditional standards are compromised by its use in admissions and hiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim is nothing more than racism by another name . <p> " The truth is that often where there are esthetic criteria of excellence , there are also sociological criteria that have traditionally excluded blacks , " Mr. Wilson said in his June speech , whose ripples magnified when it was reprinted last fall in American Theater magazine . " I say raise the standards and remove the sociological consideration of race as privilege , and we will meet you at the crossroads , in equal numbers , prepared to do the work of extending and developing the common ground of the American theater . " <p> Mr. Brustein did not take this quietly . In an essay titled " Subsidized Separatism " in The New Republic , he called Mr. Wilson 's speech a " rambling jeremiad " with " echoes of 1960 's radicalism , particularly the language of black nationalism . " He suggested that Mr. Wilson , as a playwright who had achieved wide success in the mainstream theater , was something of a hypocrite for arguing in favor of a black theater . <p> " Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oddly inappropriate for a playwright whose six plays all found their way to Broadway , where they won two Pulitzer Prizes and I do n't know how many Tonys , " Mr. Brustein declared . <p> He concluded : " I do n't think Martin Luther King ever imagined an America where playwrights such as August Wilson would be demanding , under the pretense of calling for healing and unity , an entirely separate stage for black theater artists . What next ? Separate schools ? Separate washrooms ? Separate drinking fountains ? " <p> Such rhetoric is worthy of a play in itself , and each side has been reveling in its hyperbole as the noise level has increased . But both men are too smart , and too politically savvy , to believe in the pure , unfettered and exaggerated positions they have been advocating . In a telephone conversation last week from his home in Seattle , Mr. Wilson was calm and reasoned , stating : " It just comes down to how we are going to participate in the American theater . If we had 9 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be larger . In order for blacks to make their best contribution , we need theaters to develop our artists . Blacks do not have a history of going to the theater , and you need to develop that audience . " <p> Mr. Brustein , speaking from London , where he was in the midst of a week of theatergoing , was courtly if not conciliatory and said he viewed the debate less as an issue of the theater than as " a crucible for clarifying the conflict between the old methods of integration  --  Martin Luther King 's position  --  and the separatism that 's associated with black power . " " Equal opportunity does n't mean equal results , " he said . <p> But he admitted that foundations concerned with broadening the impact of blacks in the theater , and of black theater on society , would do better giving their money to black theaters rather than mainstream theater organizations . " I think he 's right on this : maybe money has gone to places like the Arena Stage and Hartford Stage Company that could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Only a few tickets to next week 's clash at Town Hall were still available yesterday . Both men admitted to surprise that their exchange had become such a flash point . " I thought it was just a parochial argument we were having about the function of theater and the function of black artists in theater , " Mr. Brustein said . <p> Like most cultural and political debates , the Wilson-Brustein fracas has quickly deteriorated into an either-or , whereas the reality is more of a both-and . That there is increasing room for blacks in the mainstream theater  --  as Mr. Brustein asserts , and as Mr. Wilson 's own success proves  --  hardly denies that there can be social and cultural benefits in all-black theater companies . They can serve as incubators for both audiences and talent , just as , say , the Yiddish theater did for the Jewish community for many years , serving its own audience while also nurturing actors , directors and playwrights who eventually moved into the mainstream . Obviously there are aspects to the black experience that are not easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jewish life that made sense only in the Yiddish theater , not on Broadway . <p> Accepting this does n't have to mean advocating separatism , or letting down all standards . Culture changes and evolves , and the lines always seem more sharply drawn than they really are between those who assault the barricades and those who defend them . In truth , standards are not written in stone , ethnic concerns have always inspired much art , and audiences have always come to art as a means of understanding the particular as well as the universal . <p> It is no longer possible to imply , as Mr. Brustein does , that race does not matter ; the nature of American society today is that it does , and to claim otherwise is either to be disingenuous or naive . But does that mean that it has to matter quite as much as Mr. Wilson says it does ? Race " is the largest , most identifiable and most important part of our personality , " Mr. Wilson said in his speech , quite deliberately playing down those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hovering over all of this is , finally , another issue . August Wilson is the nation 's pre-eminent black playwright , and Robert Brustein is one of the few critics who has not admired his plays . A secondary theme of this whole debate has to be the perennial power struggle between artists and critics : the artist , frustrated at the critic 's lack of sympathy for his work , lashes out , ascribing to him not merely a difference in taste but blame for much of the world 's ills . <p> The critic , stunned that his negative views seem to have done nothing to slow the artist 's meteoric rise , strikes back to assert his power . Soon they are calling each other every name in the book , and pushing each other toward positions more extreme than either might , on his own , have taken , locked together in a dance of ideology that goes far beyond anything either man ever conceived .
