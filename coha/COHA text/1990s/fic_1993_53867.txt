MALINA IS DREAMING about a particular bench in Lazienki Park , a bench where she often sits and reads on warm summer afternoons while Petita , her cocker spaniel , prowls the pathways , looking for an unsuspecting cat . She 's been going to that bench for more than fifteen years . The first time she went there she was a student new to Warsaw  --  thrilled to live in the city of Chopin and Prus , pleased to be away from her parents and her grandmother . The last time she sat on the bench she had just left the Hotel Victoria , where Pan Am has its offices , and there was a round-trip ticket to the United States in her purse . She stayed a long time that day , wondering if she would ever see Lazienki again , wondering if a year from now she 'd want to . <p> Suddenly she feels a finger poking her in the ribs . <p> " Hey , " Jack says . " Wake up . You 're about to miss Delta Implement Company . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast song Jack loves . " Foggy Mountain Breakdown , " or maybe it 's " Rocky Top . " A shower of banjo notes washes over her . <p> She sits up and looks out the window . Through the darkness she can see a bunch of tractors rowed up in a lot beside the highway . She rubs her eyes . " What time is it ? " <p> " Ten till one . Welcome to Indianola , Mississippi , home of B. B. King and me . " <p> She and Jack have driven straight through from western Virginia . She thinks she fell asleep in Memphis . <p> Driving through town she sees a McDonald 's , a Kentucky Fried Chicken , something called Mr. Quik that looks a lot like a 7-Eleven . She 's been in the country only six months , but she 's already learned that in America all small towns look alike , at least to a foreigner . She wonders if that 's true of Poland , too . <p> Jack turns onto a narrow street . The houses here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of them . In one yard she sees a pink flamingo . Christmas lights ring picture windows , tinsel hangs from trees glittering behind plate glass . <p> Jack parks at the edge of a driveway . They get out and walk across the yard toward the house . It 's dark , but as they near the door , a porch light comes on . <p> Jack 's father opens the door . He 's a huge man , even larger than Jack . He has wavy gray hair and a red face . He 's wearing a pair of glasses and a terry-cloth bathrobe . In his right hand he holds what looks like a Luger . Porch light plays on the barrel . <p> He slips the pistol into the pocket of his robe and offers his hand to Jack . " Hey , son , " he says . " How you been doing ? " <p> Jack shakes his hand . " Fine , " he says . " Good to see you . " <p> Then Mr. Westbrook looks at her . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We sure are glad you come off down here to see us . " <p> His accent is thicker than Jack 's . For a moment she 's afraid she wo n't be able to understand him . People from Mississippi have a love affair with vowels : they never seem willing to let them go . <p> " Hi , " she says . " Was that a Luger you were holding ? " <p> She can tell that he 's impressed . " Sure is , " he says . " I haggled with an old boy five years before he let me have it . Had to blackmail him even then . You interested in handguns ? " <p> " Not really . But my father had one like that . He took it off a German officer during the Warsaw Uprising . " <p> Mr. Westbrook laughs . " You wo n't have to worry about no Germans down here , " he says . " We 've got a lot of riffraff , though . The town 's seen three killings in the last year alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He leads them into the living room . Jack 's mother and grandmother are waiting up . They 're both small gray-haired women , indistinguishable , really , from one another . They both hug her . Then his grandmother  --  whose name is Annie  --  says she has to return to bed . <p> " I left my electric blanket on , " she says , " and I hate to throw money away . If you ask me , electricity 's a wasteful discovery . " <p> Jack has told Malina that his grandmother still has every pair of shoes she 's owned since the Great Depression . He says she and his grandfather , who died only last year , almost starved in 1930 ; she has never believed in her modest prosperity . It 's a kind of behavior Malina thinks she understands . Every year as September approaches , her own grandmother begins to store food in preparation for a German offensive . <p> Thinking of her grandmother makes her edgy . It 's three days before Christmas . This time last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olsztyn . This year , she knows , Adam plans to go alone . Two days from now , on Christmas Eve , she 'll phone . She 'll have to talk to her husband and her mother and her grandmother , wish them all a merry Christmas , and do her best to evade questions about when she 's coming home . Her exchange program takes an academic year , she will say . The academic year ends in May . <p> " Y'all must be hungry , " Jack 's mother , Darlene , is saying . " You want bacon and eggs or a sandwich ? " <p> Jack pats his stomach . " Bacon and eggs , " he says . " And I would n't mind some grits on the side . " <p> Malina offers to help in the kitchen , but Darlene says she must be tired and orders her to rest . So she sits down on the couch in the wood-paneled den and listens to Jack and his father . <p> " Your grandmother , " Mr. Westbrook says , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door to the hallway , to make sure it 's closed . " She 's pinching pennies like never before , and she 's convinced there 's nothing ahead but disaster . She finally found a good deal on a monument for Henry , one of them his-and-hers markers , and they told her it 'd be cheapest if she had as much of the engraving done right off as she could . So we go down there the other day to see it , and it 's the damnedest thing . On her side it says , Annie L. Pope . Born May 3 , 1910 . Died  --  and there 's a blank spot  --  followed by a 1 and a 9 . I looked at it and ! said , ' Annie , what are you aiming to do if you live past the year 2000 ? ' She gets this surprised look on her face , like she had n't entertained that possibility . ' Well , ' she says , ' I just ca n't afford to do that . ' " <p> Jack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , she thinks of the last talk she had with her grandmother , the week before she left for the United States . " The next time you see me , " her grandmother assured her , " I 'll be stretched out under a slab on the hill above the lake . But ! love that little lake . My husband and all my friends are buried there . There 's no better place in the world to be dead . " <p> She and Jack eat a huge greasy southern meal , during which Jack frequently praises his mother 's cooking . Darlene beams as each forkful disappears into his mouth . <p> Tomorrow , Jack promises , Malina will prepare Hungarian stew for dinner ; it 's his favorite of all the dishes she 's cooked for him during the last three months . He says you have to taste it to believe it . <p> She 's shown to a bedroom across the hall from the one where Jack will sleep . Jack waits until they 're alone in the hallway and embraces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt , she inhales his odor . The way he smells is one of many things she loves about him . He says it 's the soap he uses , Irish Spring , combined with Brazilia , his cologne . The other night he proposed they put them together and market a new scent . They would call it Atlantic Crossing . <p> Now he says , " I 'm so glad you came with me . I did n't think you 'd agree to do it . " <p> " I did n't think I would either , " she says . " I just did n't want to miss the chance to spend Christmas with you . " <p> " Maybe we 'll spend other Christmases together . " <p> " Maybe , " she says . <p> He squeezes her tightly . " Good night , " he says . " Get some sleep . " <p> She wakes before dawn , feeling nauseated . Every item on her plate was soaked in Crisco . She already knows they 'll expect her to eat the same type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind to stay in bed late . <p> Jack works for a newspaper in Roanoke , Virginia . Malina met him at Virginia Polytechnic Institute , when he came to give a talk at the School of Communications . The subject of his lecture was " The Development of Newspapers in the Deep South . " She saw it advertised in the student paper and decided to attend . She wanted to learn as much about the country as she could , and she had a lot of empty hours to fill . <p> She ca n't remember much about the lecture . What she remembers is how hot the night was . It was the heat that led her to drink so much punch at the reception , and it was the punch that made her head foggy . <p> She found herself standing in a corner . She had stood in a lot of corners lately . A few American graduate students had invited her to parties , but when she got there she had a hard time talking with them . They never became more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles . They kept breaking up into components  --  big white teeth , long pink nails . <p> That night at the reception she noticed that Jack was standing in a corner , too . She 'd seen a few people shake his hand right after the lecture , but from then on everybody ignored him . He kept refilling his cup , just like she did , and staring at the floor with a forced grin on his face . She 'd begun to think Americans never felt uncomfortable ; she was grateful to him for showing her that was n't the case . <p> She drained her cup , walked over to him and told him she 'd enjoyed his talk . <p> He laughed . " Does n't look like anybody else did . ! saw a couple of people nodding off . " <p> " I thought it was really informative . " <p> " Hell , I hope it was , " he said . " I 'm not exactly academic . I spent most of last night digging through the Encyclopedia of Southern Culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , I kept getting sidetracked . I read all the entries on blues and country music , and then I got off into the section on southern cooking . I 'm from Mississippi , " he said , " and I like to eat . " <p> He was n't fat , but he did have a belly . It strained at the fabric of his navy-blue sweater . <p> She said , " Well , you sounded knowledgeable . " <p> " If you do n't mind my asking , " he said , " where are you from ? " <p> " Poland . " <p> " I bet you like Szczypiorski . " <p> None of her professors in the English department had heard of any Polish writers except Milosz . She said , " How do you know about Szczypiorski ? " <p> " I 've always been interested in Holocaust novels , " he said . " I read The Beautiful Mrs. Seidenman last year , and it knocked me out . I 've got another one of his books at home , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I live in Warsaw , and I often see Szczypiorski drinking coffee and eating cheesecake at the Telimena Cafe . " She loved to sit there herself , read a paper and sip tea . She had not known how much she 'd miss those daily pleasures . <p> " Next time you run across Szczypiorski , " Jack said , " I wish you 'd buy him a drink and tell him there 's a guy in Virginia that thinks he 's hot stuff . " <p> She laughed . " Oh , I do n't think I could do that , " she said . " ! do n't know him personally . " <p> He said she was probably right not to do it . In Boston a few years ago , he told her , he 'd phoned his favorite American writer  --  it was someone she 'd never even heard of  --  and asked if he could take him to dinner . The writer said yes . At the restaurant he was princely , but a few weeks later , when Jack called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sounded delirious . " He kept saying , ' Sue me if you want to , ' " Jack said , " and then he started crying . I finally hung up on him . That was my last contact with celebrity . " <p> He looked around the room , then glanced at his watch . " I guess I 've done my bit for American education , " he said . " You want to go out and grab a drink ? " <p> Evidently he had not noticed her ring . She wanted to go with him , wanted to sit in a bar with an American man and find out what that felt like , but she did n't know what it would mean if she did . <p> She said , " I 've got an early class tomorrow . Maybe I should say no . " <p> " Listen , " he said , " do you have any idea what 's happening right now , not more than six blocks from where we stand ? " " No . " <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Bluegrass Cardinals ? " <p> " Just a bunch of country boys with enough money to buy themselves some leisure suits and some nice guitars and banjos . In other words , a bluegrass band , " he said . " A really good one . " <p> " I 've got a lot of Wordsworth to read , " she said . " The Prelude . " <p> " Just imagine what your friends back in Warsaw 'll say when they find out you had a chance to witness a whole performance by the Bluegrass Cardinals and passed it up for a prelude . " <p> The bar was dark and smoky . On either side of the bandstand stood a massive totem pole . Most of the men in the room wore blue jeans and boots , plaid shirts and cowboy hats . The women had long lashes , and their hair was stacked up high . <p> The band was good , the music fast and intricate . But the song lyrics were sentimental , and the lead singer sang them so seriously  --  eyes squeezed shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out laughing once or twice . <p> She and Jack sat in a booth at the rear of the room and drank one beer after another . They talked between songs and during the intermission . He asked her a string of questions  --  about her job , her apartment , Warsaw , Solidarity , Tyminski , Walesa , and Polish vodka . He said he 'd read a lot of books set in Poland , and he 'd love to see the country one day . <p> " And I 've read Faulkner , " she said . " I 'd like to see Mississippi . " <p> While they talked , she kept waiting for his face to break up . But despite all the beer some adhesive held him together . <p> I am looking at a person , she told herself . This man , this American , is an entity of substance , a thing of mass and feelings . <p> She wondered what he saw when he saw her . Did he think she had lived her whole life in a cage , that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to eat ? Would it stun him to discover that she owned a lot of books , a German car , one-half of a cottage on the Baltic coast , and that none of those possessions meant any more to her than they might have to him ? Her heart pumped blood just like his did . <p> They kissed in the parking lot . He exuded a tropical odor . <p> " You know what ? " she whispered . " I 'm married . I should have told you . " <p> " I saw your ring , " he said . " I 'm lonely . That 's what ! should have told you . " <p> " You did n't need to . I figured it out . " <p> Somebody drove by in a pickup truck and whistled . <p> He said , " I wish you 'd come home with me . " <p> " I want to , " she said , " but my husband would never do this to me . If ! go home with you , I 'll feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped , " he said , stroking her hair , " that we could put off the morning for a while . " <p> She saw him almost daily but resisted moving in . <p> His house clung to a mountainside halfway between Blacksburg and Roanoke . When the wind blew , the branches of trees scraped the roof . At midnight a train rumbled by a few hundred feet below . He said it was the New River train , made famous in a bluegrass song . <p> " That 's why ! bought the house , " he said . <p> The house had four bedrooms , two baths , a basement with a big woodstove . Every fifteen or twenty seconds when you were taking a shower the water would stop . It was something to do with a lack of pressure in the pump . <p> " I got the place cheap , " he said , " because one day it 'll slide down the mountain . By then I 'll be gone . " <p> " Gone where ? " <p> " Mississippi . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure , " he said . " It 's home . " <p> He was thirty-five and unmarried . His relationships with women , he said , tended to end badly . The only woman he 'd ever lived with had left him because he 'd refused to feed her goats . <p> He made a decent salary but spent most of it on records and books . He ate dinner at places like Bonanza and Wendy 's . He never separated his clothes into colors when he washed them , so a given shirt might change hues three times in two weeks . <p> " It 's the sartorial equivalent of recycling , " he said . <p> He lay beside her for hours , kissing her hair , kissing her eyes , her fingers . He made her name her body parts in Polish . <p> They took long Sunday drives on the Blue Ridge Parkway . He 'd vacationed in the mountains with his family . He pointed out a motel where they 'd spent a night in 1963 . <p> The mountains in autumn were burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon the sun had burned the chill away . They lay on a blanket in a meadow near Galax , listening to old-time fiddlers . She loved a tune named " Soldier 's Joy . " It had come from some war , Jack was uncertain which . <p> He had never played chase among ruins , he did not know what treasures a bombed-out building offered . He had never worn unlined shoes to school through ankle-deep snow . His father had not disappeared in the fifties and returned with a limp and a lisp . Clicks and pops when he talked on the phone were not unnerving . <p> She had married her best friend . More than half her history was inseparable from his . He could finish singing any song she could start ; he could n't start a song she could n't finish . She knew before he did when he wanted to leave a party . She could tell from the way he handled certain objects  --  ashtrays , coffee cups , keys  --  when something she had done was displeasing . If she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which friend she had gone to visit . " How 's Nina ? " he would say . " Did she get her sink fixed ? " <p> Too much of her life had been like that . She knew the other actors ' moves and moods , she knew where all the props were . She knew when the lights would dim . She knew all her lines , and delivering them on cue was an easy thing to do . But every performance sapped a little more of her interest in the role . <p> This is it , she thought as she lay beside Jack in bed , the mountainside rumbling from the motion on the rails . Real life is really beginning . <p> She could swear she heard a banjo playing somewhere . <p> Annie , Jack 's grandmother , is standing in the kitchen , looking at the small Polish cookbook that lies open on the countertop . Malina stuck the book in her bag as an afterthought the morning she left Warsaw . <p> Annie wrinkles her nose . " I ca n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I 'd be able to recognize a word here and there . " <p> " I 'll translate for you , " Malina says . " The recipe calls for one-and-a-half pounds of pork with bones , three tablespoons flour , one medium onion , two-and-a-half tablespoons of fat for frying , five cups of sauerkraut , salt , ground paprika , one bay leaf , and red wine . " <p> " Wine ? " <p> Too late , Malina remembers that Annie is a staunch Baptist . According to Jack , she considers fermentation a diabolical process . " You just add a splash of the wine , " she says . <p> " I 've lived eighty-one years , " Annie says , " without soaking up a single drop of alcohol . " <p> It 's starting to go badly , Malina thinks . She wishes Jack were here . He 's out back with his father , looking at a new riding lawnmower . Why anyone would want to ride a lawnmower is beyond her . Darlene has gone Christmas shopping . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for the circulation . " <p> Annie says , " You aim to keep circulating with Jackie ? " <p> Malina does n't know what to say . For obvious reasons Jack has n't told them that she 's married . <p> " He wants everybody to think he likes living off up yonder in that house all alone , but that 's really not true , " Annie says . " When he was down here last Christmas , he told me ' Grandma , I 'm lonesome . ' " <p> Jack did not see his family last Christmas  --  he had to work  --  but the fact that Annie would lie to help secure his happiness makes Malina want to embrace her . <p> " I know that boy well , " Annie says . " I think he wants to marry you . I bet he 'd like to have babies . " <p> She imagines her face melded with Jack 's . She hears thin little voices crying mamusia , sees herself sitting in a rosewood rocker , nursing one baby after another . Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , he has to take out the garbage or change the car oil . <p> She wipes her hands on the apron she 's wearing . Her eyes have grown misty . She says , " ! like Jack a lot , Annie . He 'd make a wonderful father . " <p> Annie puts her arm around her . Malina feels the frailness in her bones . " Do n't you worry , Marlene , " Annie says . " I 'll eat your stew , alcohol and all . " <p> While Malina prepares the meal , Annie hovers nearby , peppering her with questions about her family . Malina tells her that her father died five years ago , that her mother is healthy  --  she still works as a clerk in a bank  --  and her grandmother lives alone in a one-room apartment , in a city not far from the Lithuanian border . <p> " She was born in Warsaw , " Malina says , chopping up the onion on a cutting board , " but she moved away after the Second World War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she speaks about the basement she and Malina 's mother lived in during the worst of the bombing . The only working stove was on the third floor ; she had to risk her life to boil milk . " She left , " Malina says , " because she did n't think they 'd ever rebuild the city . " <p> " That war messed Indianola up too , " Annie says . " They tore down four nice houses so they could build an ugly armory . Spent a whole wad of money putting the thing up , and soon as they drove the last nail in , the darned war ended . " <p> She shakes her head . Clearly the waste still disturbs her . <p> They eat dinner at a big table in the dining room . On a hutch nearby stand several pictures Malina first noticed last night . Jack at age six , dressed up like a cowboy , with fringe on his cuffs and shoulders . A graduation picture , in which he 's wearing cap and gown , and a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only child the Westbrooks had , the only living creature they can cling to in old age . <p> Having only one person to hold on to , she thinks , must be a frightening prospect . She comes from a sizable family , has two sisters and a brother , a bunch of nieces and nephews . Three or four times a year they get together . <p> Forks flashing , knives clattering against their plates , the Westbrooks and Annie agree that Malina is a great cook . Darlene says , " What all 's in this stew ? " <p> Before Malina can reply , Annie says , " It 's mostly stuff that you would n't think would fit together . " She spears a piece of pork , as if to punctuate her statement . " A little of this and a little of that , but you mix it all up and it 's nothing but nice . " <p> Darlene says , " I want to get the recipe before y'all leave . " She ducks her head girlishly and says , " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Malina says , " I want to . " <p> Want is n't will , and from the way Jack stares at his plate , she can tell he noted the verb choice . <p> Annie lifts her napkin , dabs her mouth and says , " Marlene , honey , what part of Poland is Hungary in ? " <p> She and Jack and Mr. Westbrook are in a pickup truck , on their way to the liquor store . The Luger is under the truck seat . It 's Christmas Eve morning , and Mr. Westbrook has said that tonight , after his wife and mother-in-law are in bed , they 'll all share a drink . He wants Malina to taste Wild Turkey . <p> Sometime this afternoon she 'll have to phone Poland . By tonight , she thinks , she 'll need a good drink . She 's only spoken to Adam twice since she started seeing Jack . Both times he sounded worried , as if he feared that something was wrong but had no idea what . His letters betray the same concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait until May . By the way , you have n't told us yet what day you 'll be home . Does n't an open ticket need to be revalidated ? Do n't forget to do that in advance . He wrote those words at the desk in their bedroom , a small unfinished pine desk they waited in line one cold morning to buy . They chose everything in their apartment together . All the items they own reflect consensus . <p> Mr. Westbrook drives them down the town 's main street . Jack points out Piggly Wiggly , the store where his mother buys her groceries ; a king-sized Santa rotates in the window . Styrofoam candy canes have been attached to all the light poles , and a banner spanning the street says MERRY CHRISTMAS . <p> They make a left turn . Jack says , " There 's the newspaper office . " He jabs his finger at a building that looks like the shops you 'd see in an American western : there 's a big glass window with bold letters on it , an awning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jack says . " It 's good , but it could be better . " <p> " I 've been trying to talk Jack into buying it , " Mr. Westbrook says . Jack says , " With what ? " <p> " There 's plenty of folks here that 'd still loan you money . " <p> Jack turns to her and laughs . He says , " How 'd you like to be a **43;100;TOOLONG manager-delivery person ? " <p> She says , " You 'll have to let me think about that . " <p> The liquor store is out on the highway . She and Jack wait in the pickup while Mr. Westbrook goes in to buy the whiskey . It 's warm in the pickup even without the heater on . The people on the streets are n't wearing coats , just sweaters or windbreakers . It 's probably snowing now in Poland . <p> Jack takes her hand . Last night he came to her bedroom and sat beside her on the mattress . " That night I met you , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know what 's happened . I ended up wanting more . " He said he hoped bringing her here had n't been a bad idea . She said it had n't , she liked his family very much . But the truth is that Mississippi is n't Virginia , just as Hungary is n't Poland , and the house on the mountainside is too far away . For three months she talked with almost no one but Jack . Now , suddenly , the rest of the world is back . <p> He says , " You look sad . " <p> " I 'm not sad , " she says . " I just feel a little bit strange . This is the first Christmas I ever spent away from Poland . " <p> " Are you thinking about your husband ? " <p> " Do you want me to say I 'm not ? " <p> " It 'd be odd if you were n't , " he says . He looks out the window . Through the front of the store they can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the man behind the register . Shelves filled with bottles line the walls . " You know , you 've never really told me what Adam 's like . " <p> " He 's a wonderful man , " she says . She enumerates his fine points . He 's honest , kind , hardworking , very bright . He 's devoted to her . He would do almost anything she asked . <p> Jack tries a joke . " Sounds a lot like me . " <p> " In some ways , " she says , " I guess he is . Probably the biggest difference between Adam and you is that you 've made me fall in love and he was never able to . " <p> Mr. Westbrook comes out of the store with a brown bag under his arm . He gets in the truck and hands her the whiskey . " This stuff 'll make you see double , " he says . " But since I 'm starting to lose my eyesight , I figure I can stand a little extra eye power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lenses are . <p> On the way home , he stops the truck near a green board fence . Through the spaces between the boards she sees old cars piled up on one another . On a light pole , about twenty feet above the ground , rests a rusty red Volkswagen Beetle . A legend on one door says A &; H USED PARTS . <p> Mr. Westbrook says , " That 's nothing but the shell of the car on the pole . Every year or two they have to put another one up there . It rains a lot here , and old cars on poles rust out pretty quick . " <p> He says the reason he stopped here has nothing to do with junked cars . " Back in the forties , " he says , " this junkyard was used as a POW camp . " <p> Jack says , " I did n't know that . " <p> The camp never had more than ten or fifteen prisoners , Mr. Westbrook tells them . The camp commander hired the prisoners out to local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was nowhere the prisoners could go except Greenwood or Leland . <p> Mr. Westbrook says his father worked the POWs in his cotton fields . <p> " The prisoners were German , " he says , " and by and large a sullen bunch .

He swore up and down he was Polish . Said they took him prisoner and made him serve in the Wehrmacht . You ever hear of anything like that happening ? " <p> " There were many instances of it , " she says . " Mostly in the south and southwestern parts of Poland . There were a lot of people of German origin in those areas who spoke Polish and considered themselves Polish , but the Germans did n't agree . " <p> " Daddy always thought the boy was lying , " Mr. Westbrook says , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . The others did n't seem to have much use for him , and I figured that was a good sign . " He shakes his head . " I can still remember the name of the place he said he was from  --  a town called Gliwice , " he says , getting the pronunciation almost right . " Just saying that word made his voice break . " <p> She can see him : a big Silesian boy in his early twenties with hair the color of straw . For all he knows , everyone he loves is dead . He leans on his hoe in sweltering heat , in a field six thousand miles from home . Mosquitoes buzz near his face . Slowly he pronounces the name of a place . The sound of the word is all he has left . <p> She feels as if a sock has been stuffed into her throat . " What happened to him ? " she says . <p> " I do n't know  --  they sent ' em someplace else , " Mr. Westbrook says . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 've always liked to think that somehow he made it back to Gliwice . " <p> After lunch she and Annie and Jack visit the cemetery . Annie intends to lay a plastic wreath on the grave of her husband . She has chosen plastic , Jack says , because it can be used again next year . She 's a little bit worried that it might be stolen . <p> The cemetery looks just like the cemetery in Blacksburg . Most of the markers are small , and there are no slabs over the graves like there would be in Poland . The street runs close to the spot where Jack 's grandfather lies . <p> They park the car and walk across the brown grass . Jack 's grandfather 's marker has two granite pillars . She notices the dates by Annie 's name . <p> Annie leans over and places the wreath at the head of the grave . <p> " He was an awfully good man , " she tells Malina . " I 'll be proud to lay next to him through eternity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Malina . " I wish Grandpa could have met you , " he tells Malina . <p> " He sure would have liked her , " says Annie . <p> For a moment they stand there , Malina bound to Annie by Jack . He has brought them together . A woman born in Mississippi in 1910 and a woman half a century younger from the Mazurian Lakes . <p> She marvels at his power to pull her  --  even as , with one gentle motion , she begins to draw away . <p> She 's standing at a small table in the den . Jack and his parents and Annie are on the living room couch . The four of them talk quietly , the lights from the tree throwing various shades upon their faces . She can see them in there , she can hear their voices , but the sounds they 're making refuse to form words . <p> She 's holding the receiver close to her ear . The last five times she dialed , the call failed to go through . <p> She hears the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The phone in her mother 's apartment begins to ring . <p> Her grandmother , legs swollen and breath coming short , puts her hand to her mouth . Adam 's fingertips whiten on the arms of his chair . Her mother is already there , lifting the receiver . <p> There 's a carol on the stereo . Lulajze Jezuniu . Hush , little Jesus . It 's a badly scarred record , one she listened to as a child . She hears the old song clearly , even here in this new world . <p> " Malina , " her mother says . " We 've been waiting . " <p> " I know , " she says . " I have too . " <p> " How are you ? " <p> " I 'm fine . How 's Grandmother ? " <p> Her mother hands her grandmother the phone . She hears the labored breathing . " Malina , " her grandmother says . " I 'm alive again at Christmas . " <p> It 's as if she 's opened a gift box and found another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Malina . " And I 'm grateful . " <p> " When will you come home ? No , wait , Adam wants to hear you say it . He 's having silly ideas . " <p> When he comes on the phone , he sounds tentative . " Malina ? " <p> She remembers an attic apartment in West Berlin . It belonged to a friend who let them live there one summer when they were working illegally . At night they lay awake listening to a street singer who looked for all the world like Herzog 's Strosek . He played the accordion , and they always wanted to give him money , but the marks were what they had come for . She worked all day in an Eis Bistro ; Adam made rolls in a bakery . They earned enough to buy a Volkswagen in decent condition , and they drove it all over Germany and into Belgium before it was time to go home . <p> Berlin is no longer divided , but she knows she is , knows that in some sense she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will have to wall off . For the most part she 'll probably succeed . But someday , she thinks , some ordinary day , when she 's loitering on a street in the Old Town , looking at French fashions through a shop window or admiring leather goods at a sidewalk bazaar , a sound will stop her heart . Wafting toward her on the breezes of a Warsaw autumn , as light as the fingers that pluck it , the tinkling music of a five-string banjo played in the Old Town Square . <p> <p> By Steve Yarbrough <p>
