Even the very best basketball players can be highly predictable , tirelessly flogging their pet moves , unable to go to their left , or in the case of someone like , say , Shaquille O'Neal , incapable of playing the game at all if it means moving more than five feet from the rim . But Purdue 's Glenn Robinson , the 6 ' 8 " junior forward who is first in the nation in scoring ( 29.7 points per game at week 's end ) , first in the Big Ten in rebounding ( 10.2 per game ) and first in the next NBA draft if he chooses to make himself available , is nothing if not versatile . // " There are two sides of the street , " Robinson once told an interviewer , speaking of the perilous avenues of his hometown , Gary , Ind . " You can choose to be on one side of the street  --  or you can go to the other side . I get along with people on both sides of the street . " // On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic or hoisting one up from the corner . He can dribble from baseline to baseline , or he can reel in an alley-oop pass for a dunk . His 34-inch vertical leap would not be extraordinary except for his height , a point noted by Ohio State center Gerald Eaker , who watched Robinson torch the Buckeyes for 40 points on Feb. 23 . " I did n't expect him to elevate that high , " says Eaker . " He got the ball in the lane and he kept going up and up . There 's really no way to guard him . All you do is try to contain him . I 've never played against anybody like that . " // At Indiana on Feb. 19 , Robinson scored 39 points in an emotional 82-80 loss to Purdue 's hated downstate rival . The Hoosiers had so little success guarding him that Indiana coach Bob Knight resorted to a matchup zone against Robinson in the second half , the highest and most painful compliment that Knight , the man-to-man man , can pay . Robinson 's play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling with about four minutes to go , Knight clapped his hands over his head sort of like a seal and then began urging the crowd to do the same . // Knight had been given a foretaste of the damage Robinson can do a year ago , when Robinson unloaded 24 points on the Hoosiers in Bloomington . " He single-handedly ruined everything Indiana was trying to do in that game , " recalls Boston Celtic scout Jon Jennings . " He destroyed them inside , and then he took them outside and shot threes . Versatility is the key to his game . " // So much so , in fact , that Robinson may well be the most complete NCAA Player of the Year ( a title he will not win officially until later this month ) since 1979 , when another Indiana phenom named Larry Bird won the award . Like Bird , Robinson has taken a nondescript bunch of teammates and elevated them beyond their wildest dreams , except that Robinson has done it playing in what may be the toughest conference in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Ten with a 25-4 record and was ranked No. 6 in the AP poll . // In the past decade the only players of the year who came close to matching Robinson 's stats were LSU 's O'Neal ( 27.6 points , 14.7 rebounds in 1990-91 ) and Navy 's David Robinson ( 28.2 points , 11.8 rebounds in ' 86-87 ) . But neither Shaq nor the Admiral possessed Glenn Robinson 's arsenal . David Robinson had only one three-pointer in his award-winning season , and O'Neal had none , but Glenn Robinson had already made 61 through Sunday 's games . Even Duke 's Christian Laettner , that supposed paradigm of versatility , converted only 54 threes as a senior in 1991-92 , and Laettner did n't have the boards ( 7.9 ) or the scoring ( 21.5 ) Robinson has . " Robinson plays a very simple game , " Los Angeles Laker general manager Jerry West told the Los Angeles Times . " He just plays basketball the old-fashioned way . " // Before Robinson ever played a game at Purdue , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robinson liked the name so much , he even had himself tattooed on the chest with the head of a snarling bulldog wearing a spiked collar . But Robinson might just as easily have left the tattoo parlor that day last year with a big red heart and the word MOTHER engraved on his breast , for in her formidable presence Big Dog is reduced to kibbles and bits . // Christine Bridgeman was an unmarried teenager when Glenn was born , but she was determined that her son would grow up straight and true . She had attended Roosevelt High in Gary , and she wanted her son to go there too . The school is a block away from the small house where Christine moved with her family when Glenn was old enough to enroll at Roosevelt High . // It was far from certain , however , that Robinson would play basketball at Roosevelt , for as recently as eight years ago his game was so shaky he refused even to go out for his seventh-grade team . " I had two fat little managers , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in the fourth or fifth grade , " says Roosevelt coach Ron Heflin . " He was n't very good . People do n't understand how hard that kid worked . He has n't always been a polished ballplayer. " // Glenn improved enough to make the junior varsity as a freshman and the varsity as a sophomore , but when he came home with low grades during that second season , Christine marched him into Heflin 's office and announced that her son would not be playing again until he improved his grades . She looked as if she would have been holding him by the ear if she could have reached that high . " She looked straight up and said , ' Glenn , do you understand me ? ' " recalls Heflin . " You could n't help laughing at how this little woman had control of him . " // Robinson 's diligence on the court eventually paid off , as he led Roosevelt to a three-year record of 73-7 and a state championship . He also won for himself the Mr. Basketball title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller , downstate communities . Bringing the highest basketball honor a Hoosier schoolboy can earn to Gary  --  a city of smokestacks and refineries in the northwest corner of the state  --  might have been Robinson 's greatest achievement . " When Glenn plays , all the TVs in Gary are on , " says family friend Rayfield Fisher , a Gary attorney . " Everybody here owns Glenn ; he 's our Glenn Robinson . " // Robinson represents something to Gary that Michael Jackson , who turned his back on the city the moment he left in 1969 , chose not to . " A lot of people are disappointed because the Jacksons did n't do anything for Gary , " says Robinson . " I do n't care if they do n't give any money to the city , but they wo n't even come back to visit . The impression I get is they 're ashamed of it . A person should never forget where he came from . " // Statistics paint a grim picture of Gary . The city has an unemployment rate of 13.1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime rate is no less distressing . Last year Gary had the highest per capita murder rate in the nation  --  102 homicides in a population of 119,000 . Still , Robinson stands up for his hometown . " People come to Gary expecting to be shot , " he says . " You hear a lot of bad things about Gary , but a lot of people who say those things have never been there . " // Robinson 's home is just off the central corridor , 25th Avenue , known as the Two-Five to the men who stand along its broad shoulders every day as if opportunity might come riding through on the next bus . There is another Glenn Robinson who is well-known along the Two-Five . That is Glenn Robinson ST. , 41 , who also goes by the name Red Cap . The elder Robinson has had various scrapes with the law over the years , and the Lake County police currently have an outstanding warrant for his arrest on cocaine and heroin possession charges . // " I did n't get to know him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't really around , " says Glenn . " But I 'm not ashamed of my father . A lot of people have said that when I see him , I turn away . That 's not true . I would never turn away from my own father . " // A recent newspaper article detailing the troubled history of Robinson 's father suggested that Robinson periodically returns to Gary 's streets in search of his dad . " If I want to find my father , I know exactly where he lives , " Robinson says . " I do n't need to go searching for him . " // Similarly , Robinson has been stung by aspersions cast on his academic ability . During the Feb. 19 Indiana game , the Hoosier student hooting section greeted Robinson 's brilliant performance by chanting " S-A-T " at him . This was a not terribly subtle reference to the fact that Robinson had to sit out his freshman year as a Proposition 48 student because of his low test scores . Robinson has characterized his year on the sidelines as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends say he was embarrassed by the stigmatizing effect of Prop 48 . " I think it was harder on him than he 'll ever admit , " says Purdue guard Matt Waddell. // Feeling depressed , Robinson did little his first month in West Lafayette except eat . " I almost gave up and went home , " Robinson says . " I looked in the mirror and I had this big old stomach . " // In other words , he was one extremely Big Dog . Strangers approached him after classes and asked him how his grades were . " People would tell me , ' You 've got to get eligible so you can play , ' " says Robinson . " They never asked me how I was , or how my family was . They were n't concerned about anything like that . " // When he finally got to play , speculation began almost immediately that he might turn pro after the season . Some observers believe that he returned to Purdue this season only because he was n't a consensus first-team All-America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , if the pro scouts selected the All-Americas , I 'd have been first team . " // What did influence his decision to remain at Purdue was the Boilermakers ' first-round dismissal by Rhode Island in the NCAA tournament . " I felt we did n't really accomplish anything , " he says . " I felt I would have left my teammates hanging if I had gone out on that note . " // He also says , " Naturally , you do n't want to leave your friends . That 's the main reason I did n't leave last year . Also , I felt last year I was n't mature yet . I was n't ready to go off into that big world yet . Out there you have to be able to deal with girls , agents , people trying to give you drugs  --  all that stuff . One morning I 'll wake up and I 'll know it 's time . " // That time is drawing closer . Robinson no longer appears to be unready to venture out into that big world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson wo n't leave until he has won an NCAA championship for the Boilermakers  --  something that , Keady says almost imploringly , is still a year away  --  Robinson no longer considers the team 's performance in the tournament a determining factor in his calculations . // He has been somewhat disillusioned by what he considers to be profiteering by Purdue 's campus bookstores at his expense . The stores had sold thousands of T-shirts bearing likenesses of Big Dog until he made his displeasure known and put a stop to the practice . " I felt I was exploited , " says Robinson . " They played me like I was a dumb kid . They think I 'm supposed to see a Big Dog T-shirt and just smile because they put my picture on it . Meanwhile they 're smiling and they 've got a pocketful of my money . " // It sounds as if Robinson is ready to fend for himself in the rough-and-tumble business environment that awaits him after college . He 's learning quickly that it 's a dog-eat-dog world out there .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
