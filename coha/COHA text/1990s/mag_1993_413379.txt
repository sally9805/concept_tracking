A decade of happy days for consumer-products stocks went up in smoke in early April . That 's when Philip Morris announced it would cut prices on its popular Marlboro cigarettes by close to 20% in some markets to fight discount brands . Although many analysts hailed the move as overdue , it nonetheless figures to slash the company 's tobacco profits by as much as 40% . The result : Philip Morris stock dropped 7% in three days , pulling many other brand-name stocks down with it . Although premium-brand companies have been suffering from growing competition ever since the 1990-91 recession , the Philip Morris debacle soured investors on the entire group . Steven Leuthold , president of the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis , speaks for many analysts : " We ca n't be optimistic about these heroes of the past decade . Their profit margins are unsustainably high . " Yet a determined minority insists the worst is over . " The demise of brands has been greatly exaggerated , " says analyst Jean-Michel Valette at Hambrecht &; Quist in San Francisco . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " adds Peter J. Barry , director of research at Rothschild in New York City . " And in the past , brand loyalty has been restored in a matter of months , not years . " If you buy that contrarian argument , the reduced prices of a number of top-quality consumer securities should look attractive to you . The four below  --  recommended by analysts who follow food , beverage and personal-products companies  --  could return 20% to 30% over the next 18 months , according to the pros . They are discussed in order of risk , starting with the safest . Anheuser-Busch ( ticker symbol : BUD ; recently traded on the New York Stock Exchange at $53 a share ) . Investors searching for brand-name bargains can start at giant Anheuser , the largest U.S. brewer , with estimated 1990 revenues of nearly $11.9 billion and more than 44% of the U.S. beer market . The stock , however , is as flat as a day-old beer , trading at a price/earnings ratio only 14.1 times analysts ' estimates of 1993 earnings . Beverage producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer products . ' Anheuser and PepsiCo were hit early , " says analyst Roy Burry at Kidder Peabody in New York City . " And the biggest fall the hardest . " Beer accounts for nearly three-quarters of Anheuser 's revenues , and 95% of the company 's production is sold domestically . Its best-know brands : Budwiser and Michelob . Since sales of beer in the U.S. are growing less than 3% a year , Anheuser will be lucky to show annual earnings growth of more than 10% over the next five years . However , analyst David Goldman at Oppenheimer &; Co. in New York City believes Anheuser is starting to revive by moving aggressively into foreign markets . the first step : In March the company announced that it way buying an 18% stake ( with options to go up to 35% ) in Grupo Modelo , Mexico 's largest brewer with beer revenues of around $1.2 billion . Moreover , beer sales in that country are growing 6% to 7% a year . " The dollars may be small now , but they could add one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Goldman . If those prospects cut Anheuser 's discount to the market in half , the stock , which yields 2.4% , could rise nearly 20% to the low $60s . Colgate-Palmolive ( CL ; NYSE , $56.75 ) . " Cigarette brands were vulnerable to discounters because smokers spend hundreds of dollars over the course of a year , but toothpaste costs only a few pennies a day , " reasons household-products analyst William H. Steele at Dean Witter in San Francisco . " To save a couple of pennies , are you really going to put something you 're unsure of in your mouth ? " On such penny-wise logic , $7.8 billion Colgate has built a formidable array of brands  --  including Colgate , Palmolive , Ajax and Mennen  --  and has been able to make nickel-here , nickel-there price increases stick . " Colgate has a dedicated program of expanding profit margins , " says analyst Jack Salzman at Goldman Sachs in New York City . And Steel adds , " Every product they launch has a higher gross margin than the one it replaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of expanding overseas . " Markets such as Latin America and Asia account for more than half of Colgate 's earnings , " notes Salzman . Not only is sales growth in those regions nearly twice that of the U.S. and Europe , but profits are higher  --  operating margins were 13% last year for developing countries , compared with 9% for the U.S. and Europe . The analysts project that Colgate 's earnings can grow at an average annual rate of 14% over the next five years . Steele thinks the stock , which trades at 16.9 times his estimate of 1993 earnings , could reach $72 a share in the next 18 months . Along with a 2.2% yield , that would mean a total return for investors of about 30% . Hershey Foods ( HSY ; NYSE $51.50 ) . Thanks to the firm 's leading brands in both chocolate and pasta  --  including San Giorgio and Ronzoni  --  $3.5 billion Hershey has been showing big-as-meatball earnings gains . " There 's almost no competition from private labels in chocolate , and the brand-name guys control pasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City . About 75% of the 99-year-old company 's sales come from confectionary , where Hershey has a 22% share of a $10 billion market . Moreover , Hershey has been steadily increasing that share , largely by creating new products . For example , the company is about to launch Hugs , a kissing cousin of Hershey Kisses , with a dark chocolate center and coated with white chocolate . " Now they 're going to be able to advertise Hugs and Kisses , " says Ronald B. Morrow , food analyst at Smith Barney in New York City . Much of the rest of Hershey 's revenues are from dry pasta . In the first quarter , Hershey nosed out Borden as the pasta leader , with 27.7% of the market vs . Borden 's 27.6% . " I expect Hershey to widen its lead this year , " says Bivens . Overall , growth in sales volume is running 45 to 6%  --  " double the growth for many other food companies , " notes Morrow . The company 's weakness is that it has failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more than 90% of total revenues . Hershey did attempt to acquire Norwegian candymaker Freia Marabou last year , amassing an 18.6 % stake in the company , but was outbid by Philip Morris ; it collected a bittersweet capital gain of $40 million in the process , though . The analysts project that Hershey 's earnings can continue to grow 12% to 14% annually over the next three to five years . therefore , Morrow thinks the stock could rise to the low to mid-$60s within 18 months . Combined with a 2.1% yield , that would give investors a total return of at least 20% . Ben &; Jerry 's Homemade ( symbol : BJICA ; over the counter , $28.50 ) . with flavors such as Chunky Monkey and Wavy Gravy , this $160 million Vermont ice cream maker is merchandizing ' 60s feel-good nostalgia by the scoopful . " Consumers will pay premium for an excellent product , and Ben &; Jerry 's certainly has that , " says Ronald Morrow . " But they also get a lot of mileage out of being Ben &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 60s values such as environmentalism , explains Jean-Michel Valette at Hambrecht &; Quist . the company 's tie-dyed style comes with the superpremium end , where sales are growing 5% or more annually and prices are steep . " You could buy nearly a gallon of regular ice cream for the $2.59 you pay for a pint of Ben &; Jerry 's , " says Morrow . To up its 40% share of the superpremium market , the company is broadening its distribution . " They have good penetration of large grocery chains , " says analyst Matthew Patsky , who covers socially responsible growth companies at C.J. Lawrence in New York City . " Now they 're expanding into more mom-and-pop-style stores . " Overall , the analysts project that Ben &; Jerry 's can raise its revenues at least 15% annually over the next five years and post profits even faster . One reason : The company is building a facility to assume the 36% of its ice cream production now done by outside firms . The analysts expect earnings to rise 25% to $1.50 a share next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays no dividend and trades at a P/E of 22.8 times this year 's earnings . As a high-P/E growth company , Ben &; Jerry 's is most suitable for aggressive investors who recall the go-go years with fondness . <p>
