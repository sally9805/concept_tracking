TITLE : THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS <P> DIRECTOR : MICHAEL MANN <P> WRITERS : MICHAEL MANN AND CHRISTOPHER CROWE <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : The saga of James Fenimore Cooper 's heroic Hawkeye is retold on a grand scale . <P> This is the forest primeval . The murmuring pines and the . . . <P> Oops . Wrong boring American classic . But Longfellow 's lines are appropriate nevertheless to a consideration of Michael Mann 's ravishing realization of The Last of the Mohicans . From its first images of a deer hunt to its last shots of hero and heroine gazing westward toward mist-shrouded mountains , the film 's sensuous evocations of an Arcadian wilderness draw us into a remote realm  --  just as the need to penetrate the majesty and mystery of that landscape draws its characters irresistibly on to fates ennobling and tragic . <P> Perhaps the poignancy of these images derives from our sense that we are looking into a world now almost entirely lost . Perhaps it derives as well from the memories they stir of movie glories past , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may simply be the crazy nerve of this project that disarms one 's critical faculties : the French and Indian Wars ; a protagonist named Hawkeye ; a red-coated English army marching in straight stupid lines through the forest ; wily Indian enemies skittering through the underbrush , a menace not only to the soldiery but to virtuous femininity as well . <P> Director Mann says his first potent movie memory is of the 1936 screen adaptation of the book ( with Randolph Scott ) . He has gone farther than the older picture did in straightening and strengthening the plot  --  about a besieged fort , the ill-timed attempt of the commandant 's daughter to join her father there and the anarchy that follows his surrender . Even Magua , the treacherous Indian villain of the piece , played with deadly relish by Wes Studi , is given a good motive for his dastardliness , the dignity of his otherness and even allowed a nanosecond of pity for one of his victims . Above all Mann has seen to it that something spooky , suspenseful or just plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has eliminated the last traces of Cooper 's high-viscosity prose and sentiments . <P> As a result , the novelist 's only immortal achievement , Hawkeye , who was born Natty Bumppo in a colonial settlement but was raised by a Mohican family , has at last a context worthy of his importance as a mythic figure . This character , blending the Old World tradition of gallantry with the New World 's belief in the moral supremacy of those who live in close harmony with nature , is our Ur- frontiersman , the archetype on whom everyone from William S. Hart to Clint Eastwood has fashioned his variations .
