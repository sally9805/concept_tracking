Thirty-second in an on-going series <p> <p> in-ter-fer-ons ( in-ter-FEAR-ons ) have created a revolution in the treatment of incurable or especially resistant diseases like cancer and viral hepatitis . They 're proteins produced by your immune system that defend your body from attack by many different types of virally infected cells or tumor cells . They 're also given as drugs to boost your body 's natural immune responses . <p> There are three types of interferons  --  alpha , beta and gamma . The unique makeup of each type makes it react differently to different infections or kinds of cancer . <p> Interferons can take on diseases solo , but they 're also often used with more conventional approaches , such as surgery , chemotherapy or radiation , in the case of cancer . Alpha interferon can shrink tumors in 20 percent of patients with certain types of cancers , like chronic leukemia , melanoma and colorectal cancers , says Ernest Borden , M.D. , director of the cancer center at the Medical College of Wisconsin . For some chronic leukemias , 80 to 90 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alpha interferon was also approved by the Food and Drug Administration this year as a treatment for hepatitis C , a highly infectious liver disease that can lead to liver failure and death . Gamma interferon is used mostly to treat diseases that disarm the immune system . It was recently found to be effective against chronic granulomatous disease , an inherited disorder that leaves the immune system vulnerable to all types of infections . <p> Although beta interferon is not currently FDA-approved , researchers are investigating its effect on the immune system in various disorders . <p> Interferons can work in one of two ways , depending on the type of disease they encounter . They may attach to the membrane of a normal cell that 's facing attack from a virus . The interferon stimulates the cell to form antiviral enzymes that keep the virus from growing  --  stopping or slowing the spread of infection . <p> They also fortify natural killer cells in the immune system to search out and destroy abnormal minor or infected cells that may be especially resistant to treatment . " Gamma interferon can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of parasite and turn them into rather vicious killers of that parasite , " says Harry Malech , M.D. , assistant chief of laboratory of host defenses at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . <p> Mass quantities of interferons are produced in laboratories using high-tech genetic cloning techniques . Interferons are administered in injected form or as a nasal spray . ( Because they 're proteins , they ca n't be taken orally  --  the stomach would break them down and render them ineffective . ) Many patients experience flulike aches , pains and slight fevers when they begin using the drugs . But those mild side effects usually diminish as therapy continues . <p> Researchers believe the interferons have many more hidden talents and are working furiously to tap their potential . While there are 10 to 15 different strains of alpha interferon , only one is currently used in cancer treatment . Many of the other alpha interferons could prove to be even more potent than the one currently in use , Dr. Borden says . Much of the current research is focused on fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , following lung cancer . <p> <p> i-o-dine is a mildly effective liquid antiseptic for minor cuts and scrapes . Its value as a salve for a skinned knee is questionable  --  experts say washing the knee with good old soap and water works just as well . But iodine in its radioactive form recently made headlines as the magic potion used to treat President and Mrs. Bush 's overactive thyroid glands . Radioactive iodine has replaced surgery as the first-line treatment for adults who have Graves ' disease , the most common hyperthyroid condition , affecting about one million Americans . It also may be used to shrink bloated thyroid glands ( goiters ) caused by hyperthyroidism , and to help knock out leftover cancer cells after surgery for thyroid cancer . <p> Our thyroid glands need iodine to produce the hormones that control our metabolism and promote physical and mental development . The iodine in our bodies ( that we consume in the foods we eat ) collects in the thyroid gland , where it bonds with thyroid-generated proteins to form hormones . <p> But in people with Graves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hormone . That throws the metabolism into high gear , causing diarrhea , anxiety , weight loss and heart problems , like the atrial fibrillation that briefly sidelined President Bush . The disease , if untreated , could lead to heart failure , especially in people 50 and older . <p> Radioactive iodine inactivates the thyroid gland to stop the flood of hormones . ( Doctors have not yet figured out just how much radioactive iodine it takes to rein in the thyroid without deadening it . So patients commonly begin lifelong thyroid hormone-replacement therapy to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels . ) The patient drinks the radioactive iodine  --  a chalky " nuclear cocktail "  --  and it heads straight for the thyroid , where it 's absorbed just like regular iodine would be . " Kamikaze-style , the thyroid gland picks up the radioactivity that will essentially kill it off in a period of weeks to months , " says Ian D. Hay , M.D. , Ph.D. , professor of medicine at the Mayo Medical School and consultant in endocrinology and internal medicine at the Mayo Clinic . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazards of anesthesia and regular surgery . " <p> In most patients , just one dose of 1-131 , as it 's called , causes the thyroid to go from overactive to totally inactive within about three months . <p> Patients sometimes shy away from radioactive iodine because of the dangers associated with radiation exposure . But the doses required to treat an overactive thyroid are well below the level where harmful effects have been detected . In fact , radioactive iodine works in kind of a timed-release fashion , spreading out the dose of radiation over a period of weeks . So it may be even less risky than regular x-rays , which give you the entire dose in one shot . But despite the low risk to you , you will emit low levels of radiation during the first two to three days after your treatment . So to keep the radiation to yourself , it 's a good idea to sleep in a separate bed from your spouse and curtail any cuddling during that time . <p> Doses needed to obliterate stray cancer cells after surgery are much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those cases , patients are isolated in lead-lined rooms and tested until they reach safe radiation levels . <p> Physicians do n't like to use I-131 for Graves ' disease in children and pregnant women . Radiation damage to the thyroid of the fetus could cause mental and physical disabilities , so doctors always rule out pregnancy before they treat women in their childbearing years . And most doctors choose to treat prepubertal children with drug therapy or surgery rather than risk slowing their growth . <p> <p> i-on gen-er-a-tors are devices that turn air molecules into magnet like particles  --  ions  --  by giving them positive or negative electrical charges . <p> For years , negative ion generators have received positive  --  yet scientifically unsupported  --  praise for alleged benefits to both physical and emotional health . They have been touted as cures for everything from high blood pressure , sinusitis and asthma to constipation , the flu and the blues . <p> The shaky base of these claims is a belief that positive ions drag you down and negative ions pump you up . Hot , dry , windy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health problems  --  fills the atmosphere with positive ions . So some people blame the electrically charged molecules for their woes . On the flip side , negative ions abound near waterfalls and after rural rainfalls when people are apt to feel revitalized . So the theory has it that negative ions make you happier and healthier . <p> But the health claims associated with negative ion generators have failed to hold up under a number of scientific tests . Even the suggestion that the generators are good indoor air cleaners holds little water . The negative ions spewed into the air may attach to airborne irritants and carry them to surfaces like walls and ceilings . That puts the irritants out of breathing range but may cause soiling . <p> And the generators only take care of minute particles like cigarette smoke-much smaller than the indoor air pollutants that contribute to most of our respiratory problems . <p> If you have allergies that are irritated by indoor air , you 'd be better off considering the source than using an ion generator to clear the air , says Harold S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine . For example , if you 're allergic to dust mites , invest in a plastic cover for your mattress and wash your bed linens in hot water once a week . That might help keep your symptoms in check because dust mites are likely to hide in those places . <p> By by Lisa Delaney <p>
