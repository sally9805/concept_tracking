Old Bill had learned about this wedding , and he said if there was one thing he wanted to have again before he died , it was wedding cake . He pulled off his cap and produced ten one dollar bills that he must have been saving for something like this , and he took me down to Goodwill with him , and sure enough for four dollars apiece we came up with suits that fit us both . They did n't look half bad , I thought , his suit black with a vest that fit snug against his belly , mine dark blue with pinstripes . We washed up in the Goodwill bathroom and changed into the suits , and Old Bill put our clothes into his bag and hid them in the back alley . It would n't do to carry the bag into a wedding reception , he said . <p> We hurried down to the bus stop , where Old Bill paid our fare with one of his dollars . The driver looked at us and said , " You ca n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a destination . " <p> Old Bill returned the man 's stare . " We 're going out past the country club , " he said , " so you can drop us at Ravens Ridge , and we 'll catch the 4:40 . Why do n't you just give us our transfer slips now , so you wo n't forget ? " The driver blinked and handed us our slips without saying another word . <p> The ride out to Ravens Ridge took about half an hour . I had n't been on a bus in years , and I was enjoying it : the oil-slick smell from the rubber floor in the aisle , the smooth , cool seat under my hands , the street noises so small I could almost forget them . I laid my head against the window and felt my teeth buzz . Outside the sidewalks slid by like a dream . <p> Next to me Old Bill was talking about wedding cake , how sweet the icing was , how the tiers of the cake are so pretty you might expect water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said he regretted the day of his own wedding , when he was foolish enough not to eat any of the cake because he was arguing with the photographer about whether a candelabra ought to be in the picture ( " candle opera , " Old Bill called it ) . Finally the photographer got mad and left . Old Bill did n't feel like eating anything , then , because his bride was so upset . <p> When I realized what he was telling me , I turned away from the window , surprised . " You were married ? " I said . This was something we had never talked about . I had met Old Bill at the Little Rock shelter , and in spite of his occasional stories , it was always hard for me to picture him anywhere except on the street by himself The fortunate moments of his past , like my own , seemed more like dreams than possibilities . But then here we were in suits , and on a bus , too . I did n't need much imagination to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad look had passed over Old Bill 's face , and he leaned his gray head forward to the back of the seat in front of him . He chewed on his beard for a second , his eyes closed . " Yeah , " he said . " Been a while . " <p> " Well , hell , Bill , " I said . " I never even seen a wedding , much less been in one myself . " <p> He smiled at me , his eyes still closed . " Well , you 're about to do the best part of the whole shebang , " he said . " A wedding 's nothing but work , hard on your back and your feet . But a reception you just drink cold punch and eat cake and look at the women in those low-cut dresses . " <p> I felt a stirring in my stomach just as one of my shivers came on . My head jerked back and I shook all over . Old Bill did n't say anything ; he 'd seen me have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happened this time because I was scared and excited . The moment Old Bill roused me from my sleep that morning and said , " Get up , Ralph , we 're going to church , " I could have told you right then it would come . <p> We made the transfer at Ravens Ridge , where the last signs of the city faded into countryside , and that bus took us far out along Golf Links Road to the country club . It was about five o'clock when we got there and started walking . Old Bill said the church was about two miles up the road , and the wedding started at five , so we figured if we moved fast we 'd get there in time for the reception . <p> It was a warm day , even for spring , and soon we were both sweating . Old Bill said the work was n't anything compared to actually standing at the altar , though , especially since we had a breeze to cool us off . He was in good spirits . He brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On either side of the road lay rolling green fields , fringed and dotted with trees , and rabbits jumped around in the bushes beyond the ditch . It was loud , in a way-so much movement and birds singing and trees waving and creaking in the wind . But it felt quiet to me ; I was used to the city . When cars passed us , I noticed you could pick out the sound of each one as it came up and blew by . In the city the sounds of cars all run together . <p> It was a nice walk , and as we came close to the church I was already thinking about the trip back , how I might be able to carry a little bit of cake with me . We would take our time , I hoped , and not worry about how late a bus we 'd need to catch at the country club . We could enjoy the cooler air , walking into the evening . <p> The church was made of dark gray stone and was bordered by asphalt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows and a steeple as tall as some buildings in downtown Little Rock . Cars covered the parking lot , the sun glinting off them so that it hurt my eyes to walk through . <p> " If it was up to me I 'd not make this parking lot out of asphalt , " I said . " I 'd let it all be grass , like we seen coming up here . " <p> Old Bill was breathing heavy . " Well , it 'd be mud in no time , " he said . <p> " I guess that 's true . " <p> We walked up to the front of the church , past a small black car parked at the bottom of the steps . The car had cans tied to its rear bumper with string , and printed neatly across the back window were the words , " Just Married . " I 'd seen cars done up like this before , but never empty ; always they were driving down the street , honking and clattering . It seemed strange and lonely to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nobody but us out in front , though from the back of the church I could hear children playing . I stood and listened until the wind kicked up and I could n't hear them anymore . Old Bill stood next to me , catching his breath and wiping sweat from his forehead with his sleeve . When he felt the wind he smiled and stretched out his arms toward the church . <p> " Here we go , " he said . <p> The front doors led into a bright lobby with swinging doors . We walked through those and then had to stand there and wait until we could see in the dark . It was heavy and quiet in the church ; rustling and low voices drifted toward us from down the aisle . When my eyes adjusted I saw people taking pictures up by the altar . Suddenly I wanted to turn back , but Old Bill was already moving . <p> " This way , " he said , so I followed him over to a side aisle by the wall , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both of us were acting as if we belonged there , but still I avoided looking over at the people as we passed them . We went through more swinging doors , then down a couple of hallways , following distant sounds of laughter . Eventually we broke out into another big room , bright with artificial lights . The room was crowded with people , and at both ends of it stood a table with a punch bowl and cookies on it . Old Bill headed for the far side of the room . <p> " Why not go to this one back here , Bill ? " I whispered . I was really nervous now . I tried not to notice if people were looking at us . <p> " Cake 's on this one , " he said . <p> So we walked all the way across that giant room until we reached the end of the line . I tried to appear nonchalant , but I was keeping my eyes on Old Bill 's back . Once we were in line , Old Bill turned to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Even smells the same . My God , it 's like going all the way back . " <p> I believed him . I could sense the excitement in his voice , and he looked as good as I 'd ever seen him , standing there smiling and looking all around . It made me feel better just to watch him , knowing he was remembering something completely bright and familiar . Another shiver hit me , and I put my hands in the pockets of my suit coat , trying to keep still . There was a moth ball in the right pocket ; I resisted the urge to pull it out and look at it . <p> After a minute a woman ahead of us in line turned to peer back at us , like she was searching for something . She stared at Old Bill and me for a second , then shifted her glance and acted as if she was just gazing around . She stepped out of line and walked off , pretending to check her watch . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared to let my eyes roam . I watched the backs of the people in front of me . <p> Old Bill did n't seem to notice the woman , but I knew he was just playing his cards . He glanced casually around , shifting from foot to foot as we moved forward in line . Soon another woman looked back , and a man too . When they saw us their eyes went to each other . They turned toward the table again . <p> I tried to preoccupy myself with the refreshment table . I was disappointed to see that the cookies had disappeared , along with whatever treasure had filled the small glass bowl beside them . But there was plenty of cake left , and it looked just as I 'd expected it to , only bigger . The cake had five white layers , with yellow and red flowers strewn over each one , except on the top , where the tiny bride and groom stood holding hands . Spiraling downward from the upper layers were neat triangular indentions , marking the absence of perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What kind of person , I wondered , could work with such precision ? <p> Beyond the cake a woman stood dipping punch from a crystal bowl . The punch was green and foamy , and did n't look like it could taste very good , but I imagined it must or else they would n't serve it at a wedding . Either way I was thirsty and determined to try it . <p> We were a few people back in line from the table when a tall old gentleman about Bill 's age came up to us from behind . He had silver hair slicked down close to his head and gold-rimmed glasses on his nose . He stood there for a second , pulling on the bottom of his suit coat and looking us over . I could n't think of what to do , so I acted like I did n't notice . But Old Bill turned toward him and waited for him to speak . <p> " Excuse me , " the man said . " Are you fellows with the bride or the groom ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How about you ? " <p> The man smiled . " The bride , of course . She 's my daughter . You 're old friends of Henry , I take it ? " He glanced at me and I looked away , so he turned back to Old Bill , who was squinting and acting thoughtful . <p> " Well , " Old Bill said . " We never did call him Henry , but we are old friends . " <p> The man nodded slowly . " I see , " he said . " Well , may I ask you what your plans are after you get your refreshments ? " <p> Old Bill did n't blink , but I could tell from his answer that we 'd moved past his bluff and were into bargaining . " Well , " he said , " We thought we 'd sit out on the steps and enjoy them , and then head on home . It 's getting late . " <p> The old man nodded again . " That 's a good idea , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish my punch before I left the room . Those glasses are expensive . " <p> " I 'm not thirsty anyway , " Old Bill said . <p> " Very good , then , " the man said . " You gentlemen have a nice day . " He lingered there for a long moment , as if he expected us to leave . But we just held our ground , and finally he walked away . <p> I felt a little sick , but Old Bill was happy as ever . He leaned toward me . " Nothing stopping us now , " he whispered . " We 're home free . " <p> The cake was set out on little paper plates . Old Bill scooped up two of the plates , bypassing the punch altogether . I took one of the plates and a plastic fork . As embarrassed as I was , I could n't resist the punch , so I picked up a glass and took a quick swig , then set it down again empty . I was right ; it did n't taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When I turned around to follow Old Bill out , I noticed the sounds in the room had changed from big laughter to a sort of deep murmuring . I forced myself to look around , just for the experience , and everywhere I turned there were people looking back at me . Everyone pretended not to be staring-including me-but it was obvious . I hurried out behind Old Bill , my head hunched down against my neck to fight back a shiver . <p> Old Bill was moving fast , and I hustled along behind him . Down the halls , through the dark sanctuary , out the front doors . The sunlight hit us hard , and we stopped short , screwing up our faces . Old Bill had a sneezing fit . I stood next to him , waiting for him to recover . We were alone on the steps . At the far end of the parking lot a man and a woman were climbing into their car . As I watched them drive away , I felt the breeze rise again , and slowly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the wind . I took a deep breath and settled down onto the top step to eat my cake . <p> By the time I 'd loaded a bite onto my fork , Old Bill was finished sneezing and had already stuffed down his first piece . He was licking his fingers and breathing thick through his nose . " My God , " he said . " This is it . This is just how it is . " He sat down beside me and balanced the second piece of cake on his knees , still sucking on his fingers . <p> I took a bite of my own cake and was surprised at how little I enjoyed it . I could barely taste its sweetness . I enjoyed the soft feel of it between my fingers more than I did the flavor . Then I got some icing in my mouth , which was much sweeter , and that made me smile . <p> Old Bill laughed . He was smearing the icing from his cake onto the plate , saving it for last . " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mmm , " I said , nodding . I wiped some more icing off and stuck it in my mouth . With the other hand I pressed down on the cake and watched it rise back up to shape . <p> Old Bill finished off his second piece and cleaned all the icing from his plate . He reached back to the first plate and made sure he 'd got all the icing off of it , too . <p> " Here , " I said , handing him my piece . " I ate off all the icing , but you can have the rest . " <p> " Shit , boy , you ate the best part already . " <p> I shrugged . He took the cake and popped it into his mouth . " Mm-mm , " he said , his mouth full . He shook his head and squinted up into the blue sky . It made me want to look up , too . Above us a large white cloud was stretching out , thinning into two . The smaller tuft broke away and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his cake . " Goddamn manna from heaven , " he said . <p> I was thirsty again , but I did n't care . I licked my fork clean and put it in my pants pocket . I was already looking forward to our walk back . The sun was just over the tops of the trees across the road , leaning straight into our eyes . <p> I stood up . " Well , let 's hit it . " <p> Old Bill swallowed and said , " Yep . " He brushed his hands off and stood up just as the wind rose again . Behind him the paper plates went skittering away , toward the church . The wind caught his hair and blew it all around his face . I thought he looked fierce . Suddenly he grimaced and slapped a hand against his temple . <p> " Ah ! " he said , dropping onto the concrete . I stepped back , surprised at how hard he 'd sat down . He fell over and curled up into a ball , his hands covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling and shaking his head . Spit leaked from the corner of his mouth . He looked up at me , his eyes wide and crazy . " I knew it , " he said in a choked voice . " I knew it . " <p> " Bill ! " I said . " Do n't , Bill ! Do n't ! " I could hear my heartbeat . A shiver hit me and I straightened up , my head rolling around and my eyes blinking uncontrollably . I was frantic to stop it , I tried to fight , but it was several seconds before the shiver finally subsided . I looked around , getting my bearings . Old Bill lay quietly at my feet . There was still nobody out front . I looked down at the black car waiting at the bottom of the steps . The keys were inside . <p> I dragged Old Bill quickly down the steps and propped him up against the car . When I opened the passenger door , red balloons spilled out and bounced lightly all over him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and slammed the door . I ran around to the driver 's seat . It did n't take me long to figure out how to get the car going ; I 'd driven a truck a few times when I was younger . I tore out of the parking lot as fast as I could handle it , the cans banging and rattling along behind me . <p> I knew where the hospital in Little Rock was . I figured I could be there in half an hour if I drove as fast as the city bus did . Old Bill sat still and quiet in the seat next to me . I did n't dare look over at him , for fear I 'd drive us off the road . And I was scared of what I 'd see . <p> The sun went down while I looked for the turnoff from Golf Links Road . A few minutes after we 'd left the church , the car 's lights turned on automatically . Before long we were passing in darkness beneath rows of trees . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles in my back were knotting up . I passed a dozen turnoffs which resembled the one leading back into Little Rock , but they all seemed to come too soon . Finally I took one out of desperation . It got hard to see , and I realized tears were blurring my eyes . I wiped them away and hurriedly grabbed the wheel again . Every time I passed a car I expected it to turn around , blue lights flashing suddenly out of the darkness . The night got blacker . <p> I bit my lip , furious with myself for not going inside the church and calling an ambulance . I tried to console myself by reasoning that an ambulance would have taken too long . But I knew the real reason I had n't gone in was that I 'd been afraid to face those people again . I did n't want to walk back into that reception . I did n't want to have to ask for the phone . And now the asphalt slipped endlessly beneath me as I tried to find my way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came upon an intersection . I stopped and studied the signs . I did n't recognize the street names . An outside light came on at a house across the street to my left , and a large black dog raced out into the yard , barking furiously . I pushed the accelerator and turned right , away from the dog . <p> And then the panic left me . I gave in all at once to the knowledge that I was lost , that Old Bill was dead . There was nothing I could do but drive . I 'd meant to return the car after I got Old Bill to the hospital , but now I knew I could never find my way back . I skirted the edge of Little Rock with no idea of how to move into town , or how to leave it . I drove along dark fields and woods , incapable of anything else . In a way I felt guilty for accepting it-for having no desire to go back to the city alone , or back to the church for help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in a way , I could n't deny it , I felt free . <p> After a while I glanced over at Old Bill . He looked good , relaxed , his head hanging forward on his neck as if he 'd fallen asleep . His hair almost reached his lap . In the black suit his body seemed shapeless , a shadow with hints of substance . We passed under a streetlight and his face flashed white . I saw icing on his cheek . <p> When the houses started thinning out on either side of the road , I caught sight of a highway sign . Soon an access road appeared on my right , and I followed it up onto the highway . It was divided , with two lanes going my direction and two more lanes across a wide grassy median . Trees lined the road . There was no traffic . Overhead the stars were brightening up ; I saw sprinkles of them through the top of my windshield . <p> I was looking for a sign when I noticed a young man walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . He looked familiar . I pulled off the highway about fifty yards ahead of him , found reverse , and backed up . One of my wheels crunched loudly over a can , at first making me think I 'd broken something . The cans dragged noisily along beneath the car . <p> When I came alongside the young man , I recognized him . Old Bill and I used to see him at the Little Rock shelter every few weeks or so . He 'd been friendly enough when approached , but was generally a quiet sort . He carried himself as if he knew something about the world , but he spoke simply , never talking about himself . Old Bill and I had called him The Colt . I was n't sure he 'd ever told us his name . <p> I was trying to figure out how to lower the window when he opened the passenger door . The light came on as he looked into the car . " Well , hello there , " he said , recognizing me . Then his gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door for a long time , staring . When he raised his head to address me again , his lips were puckered thoughtfully . " You okay ? " <p> His question made my eyes sting again , so I looked away . " Sure , " I said . " Just a little lost . " <p> I heard him sigh . " I 'll get in the back seat , " he said . He shut the front door and came in through the back . It was dark again . " Balloons , " he said . <p> I turned around to look . Red balloons were shifting around in the floorboard at his feet . Next to him on the seat was a basket full of fruit , a ribbon wrapped around its handle . He picked an apple out of it . " May IP " <p> I shrugged , and he slipped it inside his bag . " How long ago did you take this car ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I said . " An hour ? It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Heading anywhere in particular ? " He studied me , his eyes reflecting the green light from the dash . He was more handsome than I 'd remembered , with a thick shock of black hair and wide shoulders . <p> " No . I think I was trying to find my way back into town . " <p> " And then ditch the car ? " he said . He had found an envelope in the bottom of the fruit basket . He reached up to the light over my head and switched it on . " Judy and Andrew , " he read . Opening the envelope , he pulled out a letter , glanced at it , then let it fall . Next he pulled out a sheaf of green bills and fanned through them . " Twenties , " he said . He cut them down the middle like a deck of cards and handed me half . It was about two hundred dollars . I took it without thinking . <p> " Drive another mile or so down the highway , " the Colt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving along the shoulder . " Come on , Skipper , " he said . " Get out on the highway and take us there . " <p> I turned and checked for cars , then pulled out onto the road . I accelerated slowly , and just when we were about to reach the speed limit , he told me to pull over again , down into the trees . I maneuvered the car down the slight incline and between two pine trees , then , according to the Colt 's directions , plowed it deep into a thick patch of bushes . The brush squealed along the windows and over the hood . I stopped the car , and the bushes all around started rising back to their original shapes . <p> " For future reference , " the Colt said , " you only need to use one foot when you drive an automatic . " He reached over the seat and found the buttons for shutting off the lights and opening the windows . " Come on . " <p> I killed the engine and we climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill in the passenger seat . The bushes pressed in all around the car . The Colt climbed back to the trunk , then leaped over the bushes to land on clear ground . I doubted I could jump that far , and I was right . I crashed into the brush a few feet from where the Colt stood . It scratched up my hands and face , but I did n't say anything . I was glad to be in motion again . <p> I followed the Colt back up toward the highway . He 'd left his bag behind in the car , I noticed , so I knew he must plan on returning . " I 'm thinking about a trade , " he said , without looking at me . We walked along the edge of the shoulder . " I 'm thinking you 're the right person to make this trade with , and not just because you 've got something I 'd like . I think the trade would be fair . " <p> After this he did n't say anything , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked to walk along the woods like this , just as I had during the day , with the wind moving through the branches and the frogs and crickets chirping . Lightning bugs floated off among the trees , thousands of them , filling the woods like blinking stars . I 'd forgotten such things existed . <p> A car rushed by , blowing my hair up along my neck . I thought of Old Bill back in the darkness of the car , the bushes clawing at the windshield . It made me anxious . I took some deep breaths and unclipped my tie , rolling it up and putting it into my pants pocket . I unbuttoned the top button of my shirt and took another deep breath . I wanted to go back and pull Old Bill out of the car , let him lie on the ground underneath the sky , the lightning bugs flickering on and off in the woods all around him . But the Colt was moving with purpose . <p> We were approaching an unlit billboard set off a small distance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a diesel truck , an eighteen-wheeler , raised up on a platform about twenty feet above the ground . I imagine it was once used to advertise a moving company or the like , but now it read : " The Black Madonna Shrines and Grotto-5 Miles . " <p> The Colt veered away from the shoulder toward the billboard . He led me right up under the base of the platform , which was held up by supports as thick as telephone poles . He looked at me . " Here we go , " he said . He waved his hand in the air in front of him and a rope ladder dropped down from the platform , startling me . He laughed and winked , and I saw then that he had grabbed onto a long strand of fishing twine , which was tied to the ladder . He looked both ways along the highway , then grabbed the bottom of the ladder . " You first , " he said . " And be quick . When you get up top go around behind the sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made of strong , thick rope , and after a moment I began to enjoy the climb . When I was halfway up the Colt yelled for me to stop and be still . A car was passing along the highway . I hung there , frozen and fearful , while the lights swept over me . " Okay , " he said . " Go on up . " <p> At the top of the ladder there were short metal posts sticking out of the base of the platform . I grabbed these and hauled myself up . The painted letters of the sign towered over me now . I shuffled along the wide ledge until I was behind the trailer , out of sight of the highway . Beneath me the ground dropped away into the woods . The trees were thick for miles , and from this height I could see over them to the blackness of the horizon , where a red beacon light flashed from the top of an invisible tower . The wind whistled in my ears . <p> In a minute the Colt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beautiful , is n't it ? " <p> I nodded . He stepped around me and reached down near his feet , pulling up a flap of carpet that was nailed onto the wall of the trailer . " After you , " he said . <p> I stared at the opening in the wall . It had n't occurred to me that we would be able to enter the trailer . I looked back at the Colt , and he winked at me again . " Need to hurry , Cap'n . " <p> I dropped to my knees and crawled into the blackness . The Colt followed me in , snapping on a flashlight . I straightened up and looked around . Next to the door stood a short table and chair . The table was built of scrap wood , obviously assembled on site . The chair was an overturned milk crate , its seat cushion a carefully folded towel . Scattered across the table were several thick candles , a tall plastic cup , a notebook and pen , and a battery-powered lantern . The Colt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he switched off his flashlight and set it down , then gestured at the room . " You 're the first besides me to see it , " he said . The giant shadow of his arm swept across the walls . <p> I had n't stopped looking . Next to the wall on my left was a bed made up of about a dozen blankets piled on top of each other ; it had a real pillow in a blue pillowcase . The opposite wall was lined with dozens of books , mostly paperbacks , many without covers . The room was otherwise bare except for a few crates near the entrance . In one of them I could see a box of crackers and two loaves of Wonder bread . The other boxes were covered with a towel . I turned back to the Colt . He was looking around the place , too , as if seeing it for the first time . <p> " Almost hate to leave , " he said . <p> " I ca n't believe it , " I said , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , " he said . " I know it . " He clapped his hands together and rubbed them . " But listen , Cap'n , we 're out of time , so let me just tell you a few things . First , do n't light a fire , no matter how cold it gets . It 'll smoke you out . Believe me , I figured that out the hard way . Stick to the blankets . There 's a creek runs through the woods on this side of the highway , just a few hundred yards in . You ca n't miss it . That 's your running water . Further on in about a mile there 's a man who keeps a little garden , tomatoes and lettuce and such . Be smart about it , though , he 's home a lot . Now let 's see-blackberry bushes on the other side of the highway ; may take you a while to find them , but they 're there . And . . . well , I guess that 's about all . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have time to think about it now . Any questions ? " I could n't think clearly . I was afraid he would crawl back out the door and disappear . " How do I get home ? " I blurted . <p> The Colt studied me for a second . Then he smiled and thrust his hands into his pockets , apparently relinquishing his haste for the moment . " Just where exactly is your home ? " <p> I returned his gaze . I understood what he meant . I knew he did n't expect an answer . " Well , " I said finally . " I want to be able to get into Little Rock . " <p> The Colt winked at me and reached into one of the covered crates . He pulled out some papers and sorted through them until he found a map , which he unfolded and spread across the table . He picked up his pen and bent over the map . After he 'd scribbled something at the top , he shot me a look of concern . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . <p> He smiled . " Good thing . I 'd hate to have to teach you tonightthere 's just not enough time . " He studied the map again . " Here we are , " he said , marking an X with his pen . " And here 's the shelter ; I 'll mark it , too . You can figure out the rest . It 's a good day 's walk to get downtown , but there are convenience stores a lot closer than that . " He winked again , apparently to himself . " Why they 're called convenient . I 'll mark a couple of them . " <p> I watched him make notes on the map . " How long have you lived here ? " I said . <p> " Going on seven years , " he said . He tapped his pen thoughtfully on the table , jotted down another note . " Ran away when I was 17 , nearly starved to death . I was going to hitchhike to Texas . Started pouring rain so I shinnied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . Doors were welded shut but I kicked through a rusty place . You like the sound of rain on the roof ? God , it 's like thunder in this place . " <p> " You shinnied up a pole ? " <p> " No kidding . Splinters like a sonofabitch . Going down was worse . I did n't come back till I knew I had the stuff to make it easier . " He shook his head . " Can you believe that ? " <p> " And now you 're leaving ? " <p> " In that car of yours , you bet I am . " <p> " What about the police ? " <p> " Yeah , I know . I 'll cut off the cans , wipe down the windows as good as I can . And check this out . " He dropped his pen and returned to the storage crates by the door . He dug around in them for a minute , then produced a blue Iowa license plate . " You walk the highway long enough you find useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prophecy . " <p> " What about Old Bill ? " <p> He frowned . " That your friend in the car ? " " Yeah . " <p> " He sure looked peaceful . " " I guess so . " <p> " Tell you what . I 'll figure something out . " <p> " I was thinking maybe you could pull him out and lay him under the stars . " <p> The Colt shook his head . " It 's a nice idea , Cap'n , but I think that 's a little too much heat this close to home . It 's just right down the road from you . Listen , I promise I 'll take care of it . I 'll treat him right . Okay ? " <p> I knew it did n't make sense to argue . " Okay , " I said . " Good enough , if you promise . " <p> " I promise , " he said . " And now I really have to go . Oh , but tell you what , let 's change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suit , and it might do me a little good . " <p> He was right about that , so we stripped to our shorts and changed . My suit fit him well enough . The denim pants and flannel shirt he passed to me were snug but not uncomfortable . He had small feet , so we kept our own shoes , and I was glad about that . It felt strange to be in different clothes for the second time in one day ; the familiar shoes were a bit of comfort . <p> I was dressed before the Colt was , so I wandered around the room looking at things while he finished . On the far end of the room I found a black spot on the floor . I looked up and , sure enough , the ceiling was blackened above me . Here was where the Colt 's youth got the best of him , I thought . I would never have tried a fire in this place . <p> " I 'm leaving , Cap'n . " <p> I hurried back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for me to see him of He extended a hand . " Good luck . " <p> " Good luck , " I said . We shook hands . <p> " My name 's Joshua Canin , " he said abruptly , as if the handshake prompted the introduction . " I 'm headed for Florida . " <p> " Ralph Barnes . I suppose I 'm staying here . " <p> The Colt winked and pushed through the carpet . I looked at the flap for a minute , then turned around and surveyed the room . Feeling around in my pockets for the money and the plastic fork , which I 'd been careful to remember , I stepped over to the table . I pulled out the fork and set it down next to the map . <p> I shut off the lantern and found my way back to the carpet flap . Outside , I walked around to the edge of the sign . I could see the Colt in the distance , jogging back the way we 'd come . In a couple minutes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , my heart thumping . A few cars passed . Eventually I saw a light emerging from the woods . It angled across the highway , and I could just see the black car pulling up out of the trees . It crossed the highway , then the median , then turned and disappeared in the other direction . <p> An unexpected loneliness settled on me . I walked around to the place we 'd climbed up . The rope ladder lay stretched across the platform . I inspected it to see how the Colt had managed this trick . There were two long pieces of twine , I discovered , working together like the rope on a flag pole . You could raise the ladder while standing on the ground . <p> I studied this mechanism for a while , distracting myself . But then I had it figured out , and still I stood there alone , not sure what to do . The wind was picking up , howling around the corners of the trailer . Below me the treetops shook and waved like water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance and looked out over the trees toward the horizon . I watched the red beacon there flashing its quiet light . I wondered how far away it was . Five miles ? Ten ? I knew I could walk there in a day . It occurred to me that I was already deciding to do it sometime . It seemed like a good thing to do . <p> The night was turning cool , and I hugged my arms around myself for warmth . I sat there and thought about Old Bill , resting faithfully in the seat of that dark car speeding south , icing on his cheek and maybe a mothball or two in his pockets . A one dollar bill saved for our bus fare home . Bill had had a good day . Maybe he would bring the Colt some luck . <p> I sat on that ledge most of the night , until the stars grew faint and the wind had numbed my ears . Birds started twittering down in the woods . Eventually I got so tired I worried I 'd fall asleep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched , then bent down again and pushed through the flap . I did n't bother with the flashlight . I found my way over to the bed and crawled in , kicking off my shoes . It felt soft and warm after sitting out on that hard ledge in the cold morning air . I lay in the darkness , listening to the wind surging against my walls and thinking , wind is as good as rain . <p>
