Part manufacturer , part retailer , Tandy Corp . is not an easily understood company . It is , however , a very profitable company , and appears to be getting more so . <p> THE UNSTRUCTURED , almost accidental beginnings of many of he giants of the microcomputer industry have become part of the folklore of the computer business . Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak invented the first Apple computer in Jobs ' garage . Compaq founder Rod Canion and his colleagues sketched their first portable computer on the back of a pie shop place mat . <p> Tandy Corp . ' s John Roach was there at the very beginning . In 1977 , when Tandy was searching for products to supplement the citizens band radios it was selling , Roach helped build Tandy 's first computer prototype . He tested the software on his kitchen table . Roach then suggested to Charles Tandy that the company manufacture personal computers and sell them through its Radio Shack chain . On seeing the machine , Tandy reportedly puffed on his cigar and said , " Build 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our stores . " <p> They sold , and Tandy 's computers are still selling , at the rate of over $1 billion a year . And to some surprising customers . The quality of Tandy 's products , especially its computers , is so highly regarded that Digital Equipment Corp . and Matsushita , among others , are buying them to sell under their own names . The five notebook and desktop computer models that Tandy makes for Matsushita 's Panasonic retail in computer stores nationwide for $1,150 to $3,200 . <p> In another coup , last month N.V . Philips of Holland and Tandy agreed that Tandy would build their innovative tape deck , designed to play both digital and conventional audiocassettes . The new product will probably be available in 1992 . Tandy is clearly to be taken seriously as a maker of sophisticated technological products . <p> Remarkably , most of the products that Tandy manufactures  --  and all of its desktop computers  --  are made in the U.S. During the 1970s and early 1980s , when many U.S. electronics companies were moving their manufacturing abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Tandy has 5 plants outside the country , 24 inside ) . As the dollar has dropped in value and the price of Asian electronics has risen , Tandy has benefited from low-cost production at home in the U.S. <p> " American consumer electronics companies like RCA , GE , Magnavox and Motorola 's Quasar are all gone from the U.S.. But we 're still here , " says Roach proudly . Indeed it is : a well-integrated consumer electronics company that designs , builds and retails its products successfully in an intensely competitive environment . <p> In 1981 , following the overnight success of the Model TRS-80 computer , Tandy 's board promoted Roach from head of manufacturing to chief executive . Roach was only 42 . Since then Tandy 's sales and revenues have roughly doubled . In its 1990 fiscal year ( which ended June 30 ) Tandy earned $290 million on sales of $4.5 billion . <p> Chuck Peddle , a computer industry entrepreneur who over the years competed against Tandy while at Commodore International , Victor Technologies and Tandon , sums up the opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I thought I could take him out , I would , because he 's a lot tougher than a lot of other players . " <p> To those who believe in the ability of the stock market to value assets accurately , Tandy is a challenge . With its shares recently at 23 7/8 , Tandy 's market value was just $1.9 billion . That 's about 40 cents on the sales dollar , less than seven times earnings , and barely five times cash flow . <p> " Wall Street , " Roach says , " just does n't understand us . " Peter Teige , a computer market analyst at Santa Clara , Calif. ' s InfoCorp , calls Tandy " the most overlooked and misunderstood company in the industry . " <p> Not that Tandy is an easy company to come to grips with . Through its Radio Shack stores and a couple of smaller chains , Tandy is the nation 's largest retailer of consumer electronics , selling about $3.4 billion worth of a dizzying mix of wire , batteries , recording tape , amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and software , cellular telephones ( it 's the biggest U.S. distributor ) and electronic toys . So Tandy is a specialty retailer akin , say , to Circuit City , Computer Factory or Businessland . <p> But something like half of the products that Tandy sells through Radio Shack are produced in its own plants . So Tandy is also a manufacturer , h la Commodore International , Apple or Compaq . <p> In fact , it 's even more complicated . Of Tandy 's $3.4 billion in retail sales , about $470 million were brand name consumer electronics products of other manufacturers that Tandy sells through two consumer electronics chains it bought in 1985 , McDuff and VideoConcepts . These discount chains , based predominantly in the South , sell high-ticket name brand gear like $3,000 Yamaha big-screen televisions , Frigidaire refrigerators and Maytag washers . <p> Merchandise sold through these outlets carries smaller gross margins  --  just over 32% in the last fiscal year  --  compared with the 53.4% gross spread on goods that went through Radio Shack stores . Why push the name brand business ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales grew by less than 1% last year . Tandy 's name brand same-store sales grew 19% . <p> In short , then , how Tandy is doing these days depends upon one 's perspective . Relative to a manufacturer like Commodore , Tandy is doing fine . Its net margins , over 6% , are far superior to Commodore 's and not all that far below Apple Computer 's 9% ( see table , opposite ) . <p> Relative to other specialty retailers , Tandy is also doing fine . Both Businessland and Computer Factory are losing money . Even well-run Circuit City nets less than 4% on sales . <p> Only in relation to its own past is Tandy currently doing not so well . In the first quarter of fiscal 1991 , revenues climbed 11% , to almost $1.1 billion , against last year 's $986 million . Net income , meanwhile , fell nearly 17% , to $52.2 million , or 65 cents a share , from $62.8 million , or 73 cents . Tandy stock has fallen from over 40 a share earlier this year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The company claims the steepness of the earnings drop last quarter came mainly because of price cuts to clear slow-moving and discontinued inventory . Indeed , Radio Shack , which now calls itself " America 's Technology Store , " only recently installed a computerized point-of-sale inventory control system . Toys " R " Us , in contrast , had a computerized point-of-sale system in place in the early 1980s . <p> Now , headquarters in Fort Worth knows more about the mix and timing of sales in individual stores . Before , each one carried pretty much the same inventory mix of Radio Shack 's 3,200 retail items . What that meant was that an outlet on the Upper West Side of Manhattan carried the same assortment of tuning knobs , alligator clips and home antenna parts as a store in Provo , Utah , regardless of the needs of the neighborhood 's customers . Today Radio Shack can target marine radio and navigation equipment to stores near the shore . <p> With the new inventory system in place , the buyers at headquarters will be able to buy less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which stores , and what does n't . That should produce substantially lower inventory costs . <p> The new inventory system is another step in Roach 's campaign to increase the productivity of each of Tandy 's stores . In this quest he is ably assisted by Radio Shack 's streetwise president , Bernard Appel , a 31-year veteran of the Radio Shack chain . " Bernie , " says Roach , simply , " is the best buyer of consumer electronics in the world . " <p> Since 1986 Roach and Appel have shrunk the number of Tandy stores . In that year the number of stores hit a peak of 9,251 , but the company spun off more than 2,000 foreign stores to Fort Worth-based Intertan Inc . The year before , sales per store had averaged $238,000 . At the end of fiscal 1990 there were 7,034 stores , with average sales of $418,000 per store . Over the last five years net profits have climbed from $190 million to nearly $300 million . <p> Yes , margins , both gross and net , have declined since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other manufacturers ' products in Tandy 's sales mix and the expansion of the name brand stores . " Whether or not we ever go back to the kind of margins we had when Radio Shack was our only business and was opening a store a day is moot , " says Roach . " We still have margins severalfold above most other retailers , and even in a bad year we 've done well . " <p> If Tandy is earning more money with fewer stores , it is ironic that Wall Street is down on Tandy in large measure be cause the stores are perceived as dull , if not downright shabby . Still , there is some reason for this perception . One-third of Tandy 's stores still have the same old cluttered appearance they have had for decades . <p> But as part of their plan to increase per-store volume , Roach and Appel began a $200 million remodeling campaign in 1986 . So far , two-thirds of Radio Shack 's surviving stores have had face-lifts ; computers and other high-ticket items are now neatly displayed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been moved to the back . Appel has also introduced more expensive items like the new high-end Optimus compact disc player and other stereo equipment and Realistic portable VHS camcorders . <p> The trick has been to upgrade the look of the stores without significantly reducing the accessible , folksy image . And so far the neater new look seems not to have intimidated anybody coming in for new batteries for a Walkman . Whether it will make the chain more credible as a place to buy high-end stereo equipment and computers  --  and the new Tandy/Philips digital/analog tape recorder  --  remains to be seen . <p> Tandy is also looking for big sales at Radio Shack for a new product it introduced in July , the 1000 RL home computer . Priced at $700 to $1,300 , it costs less than IBM 's new entry into the home computer market , the PS/1 . The 1000 RL features built-in software that the company says " uniquely becomes a member of the family " with programs tailored for every aspect of home life from compiling recipes to checkbook balancing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkably easy to use . Store people have been trained to give a complete demonstration in about 15 minutes . If there is a big market for home computers , the 1000 RL should grab a profitable slice of it . <p> " People still talk about Radio Shack as junky , " says Chuck Peddle , the entrepreneur who competed against Tandy , " but John Roach has definitely raised its image , and he 's used the personal computer to do it . " <p> Computer sales to business has never been one of Tandy 's strongest suits . But here , too , Roach has been on the move . In 1989 Tandy acquired Grid Systems , a maker of sophisticated laptops and peripherals . The Grid Systems acquisition , and the development of interchangeable hard disks  --  which allow business people to carry their databases  --  should give it a boost . So should the erasable CD system that Tandy 's researchers have been working on . <p> Last year , to gain a foothold in Europe , Tandy acquired the Victor and Micronic personal computer marketers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maker dominates markets the way IBM does here , these companies give Tandy some good product lines to build on the continent . <p> What is John Roach 's most difficult problem ? From the outside , it would appear to be counseling patience on the part of some members of the Tandy family . The Tandy clan still owns roughly 3.5 million shares , just under 5% of the total outstanding . Some young heirs , including Alfred R. Tandy , Charles ' nephew , and his step-grandson Matthew Upchurch , recently proposed that management let shareholders cast a nonbinding vote in the current proxy on whether the board should keep the poison pill the company instituted a few years ago . The implication , of course , is that the Tandy heirs would n't mind seeing their grandfather 's company taken over by an outsider at a hefty premium . <p> Says heir Upchurch : " We 're frustrated with the stock performance . " ( Management refused to list the referendum . ) <p> But Roach , still only 52 , has been through economic cycles and bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , he has been buying : Tandy has bought back over 10 million shares in the last two years at a cost of over $400 million , most of it borrowed . It is a strong way for Roach and his board to say they understand Tandy and its prospects much better than Wall Street does . Everything is relative <p> Tandy does well in relation to other computer manufacturers and to consumer electronics retailers . Tandy 's 6.2% net return on sales , for example , compares with 6.0% at IBM and 3.6% at Circuit City .
