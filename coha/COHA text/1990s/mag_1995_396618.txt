WHEN MIKE TYSON STRIDES OUT OF the Indiana Youth Center in Plainfield on March 25 , a free man for the first time in three years , there 's one thing he wo n't have to worry about . " When you come home , you do n't want a cold pool , " says Peter Talanca , one of five workers bustling to get Tyson 's 30,000-square-foot mansion east of Cleveland  --  and his indoor swimming pool shaped like a boxing glove  --  ready for the former heavyweight champ 's return . " The word is , everything has to be right for Mike . " The big question , of course , is whether everything is right with Mike . Through his teens and early 20s , Tyson was a wrecking ball in the ring  --  and , often , outside it . The last straw  --  his conviction in 1992 of raping 18-year-old beauty contestant Desiree Washington  --  was both tragic and unsurprising . ( For his part , Tyson still maintains that Washington consented to sex . " I believe I 'm innocent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apologize , " he said last year . ) The world felt it knew the man who went to prison ; Tyson , now 28 , and many of those who have visited him claim people will be surprised by the man prisoner No. 922335 has become . " I 'm trying to start my life back , " Tyson has vowed , with the same fervor with which he once proclaimed himself the " baddest man on the planet . " There is little doubt he has learned something from his prison experience . Three months after his confinement , he was disciplined for threatening guards . But gradually the 5 ' ' 11 " boxer , who entered prison a doughy 275 lbs. , some 50 over his last fighting weight , developed a different attitude  --  and a healthier diet . Tyson , whose comeback in the ring stands to enrich him by millions , KO 'd the pounds by patronizing the commissary  --  where he has bought milk , cereals and canned tuna  --  instead of the prison mess . Now he is a sculpted 216 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyson has had no access to boxing equipment , he has regained his fighting trim through daily workouts , including running and shadowboxing . " He 's in probably the best physical shape ever , because there 's been no night life , no alcohol , " says promoter Butch Lewis , a frequent prison visitor who would like to take Tyson away from Don King , his current promoter . Tyson has been exercising more than his muscles . For most of his time behind bars , the high school dropout 's " job " involved attending classes , for which he was paid 65 cents a day . He even started studying Chinese , visitors say . He lined his 8-by-11-foot cell with more than 300 books and read two or three volumes , ranging from Malcolm X to Machiavelli , each week . Tyson was so impressed by two authors , Arthur Ashe and Mao Tse-tung , that he had himself inscribed with their portraits , one on each biceps , by an inmate tattoo artist . When Maya Angelou came to visit late last year , Tyson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I met an old con , " Tyson told writer Pete Hamill last year , " and he pointed at all the guys playing ball or exercising , and he said to me , " You see them guys ? If that 's all they do when they 're in here , they 'll go out and mess up . ' He said to me , " You want to make this worth something . Go to the library . Read books . Work your mind . ' ' " Soon after entering prison , Tyson began studying the Koran intensely  --  both alone and with spiritual adviser Muhammad Siddeeq , a teacher who volunteers at the prison . Reared as a Roman Catholic , Tyson has retained his Christian name while embracing his new faith , which he credits with giving him discipline . " Being a Muslim is probably not going to make me an angel in heaven , " Tyson told Hamill . " But it 's going to make me a better person . " Friends agree he 's ready to make a fresh start . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will emerge as a disciplined adult , " says Rock Newman , manager of Tyson rival Riddick Bowe . " He has used this time to serve him , as opposed to him just serving the time . He will emerge an infinitely wiser man . " He 'll also be up-to-date . Tyson has received on average 150 letters a day and a stream of visitors , among them Spike Lee , Jesse Jackson and James Brown . They may have buoyed his spirits , but they also distracted him from his studies , said Superior Court Judge Patricia J. Gifford , who presided over Tyson 's unsuccessful sentence-reduction hearing in June 1994 . Gifford blamed the visits for Tyson 's failure on a GED exam he took last year  --  by two points . The visitor the former champ may have looked forward to most was a 4-year-old : Tyson 's daughter Michael . ( Little about the child or her mother is known . ) Michael is the only surviving member of Tyson 's immediate family besides his estranged older brother Rodney , a California pharmacist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mickey and Mikey : " She is the spitting image of him . " There has been no sign of Tyson 's former wife , actress Robin Givens , who last summer adopted a son , Buddy , now 15 months old . ( Following the end of their stormy marriage six years ago , Givens claimed to have remained friendly with her ex . ) But there has been evidence of a new woman in Tyson 's life . Every two weeks Georgetown medical student Monica Turner , 28 , reportedly has been spotted visiting the boxer . " He 's known Monica for a long time , " says Tyson confidant Rev. Charles R. Williams of Indianapolis . " She 's been a great friend . " Tyson 's most solicitous callers , of course , have been men who ca n't look at him without seeing dollar signs : a fightcard full of would-be managers and promoters . " I 'm probably the only one who 's been to see him who did n't leave a contract at the reception desk , " joked Rev. Al Sharpton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the more serious hopefuls is Lewis , who got one of his fighters , Michael Spinks , $13.5 million for 91 seconds of work , followed by a brief liedown , against Tyson in 1988 . Another suitor is ' ' 70s promoter Harold Smith , known both for the generous purses he paid his fighters and his 1982 conviction for embezzling $21.3 million from Wells Fargo Bank . At this point , though , Don King 's hold on the boxer appears to be unbreakable . King , 62 , first promoted Tyson in 1988 , three months after the death of Tyson 's friend and comanager Jimmy Jacobs . ( Jacobs was a long-time friend of the late Cus D'Amato , the legendary , single-minded mentor who plucked the 13-year-old Tyson out of reform school after seeing him spar . ) " King has been there for Tyson , " says Dr. Ferdie Pacheco , Showtime 's boxing commentator . " There 's nobody else I can think of that has even a minor chance . " Publicly the shock-coiffed King , now facing legal troubles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance fraud  --  maintains that the next steps are strictly up to Tyson . " I want to show my love and respect for Mike Tyson and let him be the guy who says yea or nay to anything that comes in his life , " he says . But privately the promoter has been overheard spreading the word among his neighbors in the exclusive , gated Foxe Chase community in Delray Beach , Fla. , that the vacant lot across the street from his $700,000 house is for Tyson 's next residence . Tyson 's current home , the brick mansion in Southington , Ohio , where the boxer is expected to spend most of his four-year probation , is also within the King orbit , just 10 miles from King 's boxing camp . Set amid a rural landscape of open fields and farmhouses , it is an ideal location if the fighter is serious about his pre-prison resolve to " never go out again to a club . " Even if that resolution holds , his past will still haunt him . First , rape victim Desiree Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , is seeking civil damages for injuries suffered during the assault ; her suit is moving through the Indiana courts . For another thing , published reports suggest that much of his $100 million ring earnings is gone  --  to managers , promoters and conspicuous consumption like his fleet of luxury automobiles , not to mention his own high-priced legal defense team . This week , of course , all that could change . Says World Boxing Commission heavyweight titleholder and former Tyson sparring partner Oliver McCall : " If he got money problems , the day he get out he will have no more . " son stands to make millions for two or three tune-up fights while he rounds into shape . ( " He has to oil his tools up , his timing , his rhythm , his balance , " says promoter Lewis . ) Then for a match against a serious opponent like Riddick Bowe , 27 , a Tyson buddy who won the World Boxing Organization heavyweight title from Britain 's Herbie Hide on March 11 , " the two fighters would split in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They could generate the greatest revenue ever . " Eager as he is for such a payday , Bowe is enough of a friend to express concern . " Everybody 's making all these plans for Mike Tyson , but Mike Tyson has n't agreed to anything , " says Bowe . " He knows what he wants , and his plans may be totally different from what they perceive . I just hope he can come back out , and whatever his dreams are , accomplish them .
