What a pity that the Clinton administration wo n't let Louis Farrakhan accept either a $1 billion gift or the $250,000 that went along with the human-rights award he got from Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi last week . Unless the Nation of Islam leader manages to overturn the decision in court , we 'll never know how he would have behaved as the world 's first black billionaire flake . Assuming Gaddafi actually intended to hand over the loot , it would have been quite a show . <P> With money like that , Farrakhan could have taught H. Ross Perot and the late Howard Hughes a thing or two about eccentricity . He shares Perot 's elephantine ego , endless self-righteousness , grandiose political ambitions and deep-seated belief that people are plotting against him . Some of his notions  --  like the mystical importance of the number 19 and his claim to have taken trips on alien spacecraft  --  are as cockamamie as Hughes ' obsession with germs . As far as I know , neither Perot nor Hughes ever pretended to speak on behalf of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly routine . <P> For example , on Aug. 16 one of Farrakhan 's top aides , Minister Tony Muhammad , prophesied that within 30 days " the wrath of God will show itself in a major earthquake " because the Muslims had been evicted from their Western regional headquarters in Inglewood , California . This may be the first time since the Old Testament that anyone has called on the Lord to get involved in a real estate dispute  --  and set a deadline for his seismic intervention . <P> Even without Gaddafi 's largesse , Farrakhan has a good deal of familiarity with the life-styles of the rich and famous . He has big houses in Chicago 's Hyde Park and the Arizona desert , a chauffeur-driven Mercedes-Benz and a killer wardrobe . And if his ego ever needs a boost , there are plenty of sycophants around to give in to his demands . Two weeks ago , several hundred of my fellow members of the National Association of Black Journalists meekly permitted Farrakhan 's Fruit of Islam to frisk them before they entered the hall where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflict on those who are visiting the President of the U.S. Then they cheered enthusiastically as Farrakhan denounced black reporters who work for the white press as " slaves . " Even though the overwhelming majority of N.A.B.J. members work for the white media , they gave Farrakhan a standing ovation . I decided not to check my self-respect at the door and passed up the speech . <P> While Farrakhan 's bank account may not be any bigger when he returns from his latest powwow with Gaddafi , his ego will be inflamed . He plans to address an African-American political summit in St. Louis , Missouri , later this month , followed by a World 's Day of Atonement on Oct. 16 , the anniversary of the Million Man March ( which incidentally wound up $66,000 in the hole , according to the Nation of Islam 's calculations ) . One can only hope most people will ignore both events , but that hope is probably in vain . African Americans are so starved for inspiring leadership that many confuse Farrakhan with a hero . If he ever gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swell even more .
