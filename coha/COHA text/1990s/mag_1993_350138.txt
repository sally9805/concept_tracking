Even now , with all hell breaking loose in Haiti , Bill Clinton wo n't relax his draconian refugee policy . Denying political asylum to large numbers of poor black Haitians " is what all this was about in the first place , " says U.N . Ambassador Madeleine Albright  --  and it still is . The Administration 's sweet talk about restoring democracy in Haiti is merely tactical , a reflection of the assumption that those who enjoy liberty will stay put . Meanwhile on the ground , the situation worsens daily . " Anyone can be killed at any time , " says Jean-Bertrand Aristide , the exiled President , and late-night disappearances are becoming common . Foreigners can flee at will , and many are doing so , including those charged with monitoring human-rights violations , but the thousands of Haitians who have been systematically repressed since the 1991 military coup are stuck . No matter , says the President who ran on a platform of putting people first  --  including , not incidentally , the Haitian asylum seekers whom Clinton promised he would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , says the President , affirming his postelection policy of forced repatriation , " We still believe that we should process the Haitians who are asking for asylum in Haiti , and that that is the safest thing for them . " Translation : it 's the safest political course for Clinton . <P> Let 's get real : in a society where informants are everywhere and potential refugees are regularly jailed and beaten for merely seeking asylum , Clinton 's " in-country processing " operation is absurd . Those who are scared enough to brave the consequences currently face at least a six-month wait before being interviewed , and in violation of international law are denied protection in the interim . ( " How could we protect them ? " asks a U.S. official , missing the point . " The place is a war zone . " ) The bottom line : according to an undisputed Americas Watch report , 14,590 Haitians have applied for asylum since Clinton took office . As of July 30 , 307 have been allowed to immigrate to the U.S. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says a disgusted Justice Department official , " and we 've got quite good at it . " <P> Treating Haitians like other refugees would mean admitting them to the U.S. for immigration hearings . Since he wo n't do that , Clinton at least ought to establish safe-haven processing centers outside Haiti . Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , is the obvious choice ; it 's virtually next door . But " Gitmo does n't have enough tents and other relief supplies , " says a Pentagon official with a straight face .
