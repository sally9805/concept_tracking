FOR AMERICA , WEDNESDAY WAS THE first day after the election of a new President . For Hillary Clinton , it was the first day to define the most ill- defined job in America . After a decade of getting up early , popping into her blue Oldsmobile and driving her daughter Chelsea to school before heading to work at Little Rock 's leading law firm , and after a year of nonstop , around-the-clock campaigning , she now has time for a second cup of coffee . Of course , her new position has its privileges : she gets to live in the country 's most famous house , jet on Air Force One to visit heads of state and throw parties with the most impressive guest lists in the world .

When the Governor talked about " buy one , get one free " and possibly appointing Hillary to the Cabinet , her popularity took a dive . " People have changed their attitude about Hillary , " says pollster Peter Hart , " but if they see her reinforcing one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Last week when leaders in the field of family law sent her a thick proposal to bring all the varied government programs on families and children under her East Wing purview , Hillary responded only by saying that she wanted to continue to be " a voice for children "  --  which fits within the choose-a-cause deportment of First Ladies past .
