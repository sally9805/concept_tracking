Q. <P> Why are so many African Americans concerned about Clarence Thomas ' nomination to the Supreme Court ? <P> A. <P> On the deepest level , he touches the very soul of the debate in black America , which is a debate between using the principle of self-sufficiency as a means to power as opposed to using our history of victimization . We have taken our power from our history of victimization , which gave us an enormous moral authority and brought social reforms , to the neglect of self-reliance and individual initiative . And now , any time you talk about self-reliance in relation to black problems , you are automatically considered a conservative . <P> Q. <P> You do n't consider yourself a conservative ? <P> A. <P> No . I think of myself more as a classical liberal . I focus on freedom , on the sacredness of the individual , the power to be found in the individual . <P> Q. <P> But other black thinkers from Booker T. Washington to Malcolm X to Jesse Jackson have preached self-reliance , and nobody called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conservative today because of the context , and the context is that for the past 25 years civil rights organizations have focused one-dimensionally on our oppression and demanded redress based on that . Well , here comes a man in 1991 who stands for self-help , and so he is anathema . The principle of self-reliance seems to devalue victimization as a source of power . I do n't think it necessarily does , but it seems to . And so Thomas seems to be against the interests of black people merely by standing for self-reliance . He 's not remotely anti-black . He 's just asking that we develop another source of power . <P> Q. <P> You have said that you are against preferential treatment , not affirmative action per se . But the widespread perception is that you are anti-affirmative action , and so is Clarence Thomas . <P> A. <P> What I 've tried to say , and I think Clarence Thomas stands for pretty much the same thing , is that by opposing racial preferences we stand for black strength rather than weakness . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that they can and will be taken away . They will diminish over time . And in the interim they encourage us to believe that redress is our power . I do n't take any simpleminded black-and-white view and say racial preferences have never done a bit of good for anybody . All I 've tried to do is point out the down side and that we 've probably come to the point where they are doing more harm than good . <P> Q. <P> Are you letting white people off the hook ? <P> A. <P> I do n't mean in any way to let white people off the hook . I think as American citizens , they have a profound responsibility to black Americans . I favor every form of affirmative action except preferences . I favor the government improving the education system in the inner cities . I favor programs that go down to the teenage mother and try to break that cycle of poverty by teaching her parenting skills .                @ @ @ @ @
