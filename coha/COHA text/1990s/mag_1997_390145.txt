First it was the child-labor scandal . Now Kathie Lee Gifford is facing every woman 's worst nightmare . What she 's learning about marriage the hard way . Interview by Donna Hanover // Backstage at LIVE with Regis &; Kathie Lee , Kathie Lee Gifford 's dressing room tells a story of its own . Look closely at the powder-blue-andwhite wallpaper , and you 'll see a pattern of ABC 's . It dates from her 7-year-old son Cody 's infancy , when the room doubled as a nursery . His crib is long gone , but the makeup mirror is lined with pictures of Cody and his 4-year-old sister , Cassidy . Along the wall , a well-worn couch is prominently adorned with a needlepoint pillow . The inscription is a comic nod to husband Frank Gifford 's work as a sports announcer : WE INTERRUPTl THIS MARRIAGE TO BRING YOU A FOOTBALL GAME&gt; But these days the inscription is no longer humorous . It is not a football game that might interrupt-possibly even endwhat to every-one seemed like a solid , loving ten-year marriage It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which reported that Frank , 67 , had a fling with 46-year-old former flight attendant Su'r.en Johnson in a New York City hotel room on May 1 . At first , Frank denied the story , and went so far as to let Kathie lice defend his honor during a commencement address in which she tearfully claimed that she and her husband were victims of a " cash for trash " fabrication . But when the ( Globe went on to print photos from a secret videotape showing Frank and Johnson embracing intimately , the Giffords retreated to get through this together , " as they said in a statement . Despite the fact that the Globe apparently tised dirty tactics to provokc the scandal-the paper reportedly paid Johnson $75,000 to seduce Frank-the evidence was brutally undeniable . not only to Kathie Lee , but to the whole world as well . In the weeks that followed , Kathie Lee bravely soldiered on with her TV show keeping up appearances on LIVE each morning , while privately coming to terms with every woman 's worst nightmare : the realization that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the foundation of her persona ai the idcal Amcrican marricd woman , had in one fateful sions-both hers and her fans . Not only had shc he been hetrayed . Kathie ce was also puihliclv emharrasscd-an experience so hurtful she refused to comment and begged for privacy Ironically , the interview here took place just a few davs before the Globe story broke . As you will see Kathie Lee had no inkling of the looming bombshell as she discussed her residual pain from the charges 16 months ago that her line of clothes for Wal-Mart was produced using child labor in Hondlras.1.ven as life was ahout to land a much tougher blow , she mourned her loss of innocence from that media storm in with its endless barrage of mean-spirited jokes . To her credit . since the labor controversy erupted , Kathie Lec has become a public advocate for stronger guarantees against sweatshop labor . Bob Adler , chief executive officer of Halmode Apparel , which produces much of the Kathie Lee clothing line , says that auditors now visit the factories once every three months to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donated millions of her Wal-Mart proceeds to children 's charities . Her latest project , Rock n ' Tots videos and accompanying books , will be in stores soon . And she has written a new book , Christmas with Kathie Lee ( Disney Press ) , due out in September . Proceeds from both ventures will go to major children 's charities . During her conversation with Good Housekeeping 's Donna Hanover , Kathie Lee repeatedly expressed her gratitude for Frank 's support throughout the attack on her clothing line . While her words are now shadowed hy hindsight , her loyalty resonates . At 44 , Kathie Lee , a self-described Pollyanna , has learned the hard way how to take her knocks and still stand strong . Although the family values she has long espoused have suffered a harsh run-in with reality , her children and her spiritual faith will surelv continue to be sources of immense coinfort Fortunately , her professional life is solidly on track . In the midst of her marital chaos , Kathie Lee signed on for a thirteenth season with LIVE , hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have more input on the show-and to take some Fridays off to spend with her children . " I think they 've come to understand that I 'm not trying to control this show , " she said . " I do n't want to he the executive producer and stay here till seven o'clock at night I just want my voice to be heard . When she talked to Hanover . Kathie Lee candidly discussed another family trauma : Frank 's daughter Victoria 's split from her husband , Michael Kennedy , who allegedly had an affair with an underage baby-sitter . " As always , " Kathie l , ee said , " Frank Gifford is there for the people in his life . Nothing brings out the best in Frank like a crisis . " Hanover asked if Frank was angry at Michael Kennedy " Not angry , " Kathie Lee replied " He 's sad . We 've learned that anger only hurts us . It 's a wasted emotion . He did say to Michael , Just remember that you have children together . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what personal anguish recent events have brought Kathie Lee , she will surely remain a loving and devoted mother . And whatever her next move , it will undoubtedly be rooted in what she feels is best for her children . DH : You have said that Frank was a rock for you during the controversy about your clothing line . KLG : Thank God for a husband who knew the truth and loved me and supported me through the whole thing . I certainly learned who my friends were and who they were not . Who did n't come through for you ? I ca n't name names because some of them were painfully close to me . They almost enjoyed the fact that Niss Goody Twoshoes was on the hot seat . What did you learn fiom the controversy ? Something deep inside me died . It was n't that I was maligned . What was heartbreaking was that it seemed nobody was interested in the truth . Nobody wanted to believe that I did n't know about the labor problems . Nobody cared that millions of dollars from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack babies . Well , despite everything , the clothing line did n't suffer . I understand that sales last year topped half a billion dollars . That 's important , because a large percentage goes directly to Cassidy 's ) lace for children with AIDS and other medical prohlems . But most important , because of all the attention , there have been groundbreaking changes to help garment workers . The garment industry has started a voluntary alliance with a code of conduct . Now , when consumers buy something from an alliance member , they can he sure a real effort was made to produce that item in a dignified , ethical manner . I know that Senator Tom Harkin D-IA is pushing for legislation that would make this mandatory for all companies . I personally support that . When I signed and licensed my name to manufacturers , I had a written promise that children would never he exploited . But it did n't help , because there was no enforcement . How are things going at Cassidy 's Place ? I was there the other day with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces of all the children in their little cribs . The playgrounds are finished . It 's such a special place . The new protease inhibitors must be offering tremendous hope for AIDS babies . Yes , but they do n't help everyone . We lost two babies last week . All I know is that the new facilities are making the children 's lives-for however long they are on this Earth-so much more comfortable and joyful . You 've made no secret of the fact that you 've approached Cassidy 's childhood differently from Cody 's . I 'm just not going to make her as much of a target as he was . She has been in New York City maybe only four times since she was born . Her life is school , ballet classes , church on Sundays , tumbling class , and swimming lessons . Cody 's in school fill-time now , is n't he ? Oh , yes . In fact , he 's in school so full-time that they do n't like me to take him out to travel with me . Does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's no big deal to him . He goes to a schtool where there are quite a few famous kids , although none in his class . His teacher told me that if any stranger came to the room and was asked to pick out the most well-known child , he 'd be the last one anyone would choose . She said , " Cody is the most polite child I 've had in twenty years of teaching . " That meant the world to me . And Cassidy ? Her preschool teacher said , " She 's a delight . She 's just so thoughtful ... while she 's telling the other little children what to do ! " I ca n't imagine where she gets that trait ! What do you do to make peace when Cody and Cassidy fight ? I make them apologize to each other regardless of who started it . Of course , one might be saying , " I 'm sorry I did it , " and the other , " I 'm sorn it happened . " But it 's conciliator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Popsicle-who got the red one . But they are a joy Every day of my life . I wipe their buns and clean their noses . They do n't care what I do for a living . I go home , and I 'm a mother to them . <p>
