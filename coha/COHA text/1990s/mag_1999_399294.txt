Section : Technology The Web Ebay hired an awfully expensive repairman to put a halt to an embarrassing string of crashes . It ca n't afford another one <p> REMEMBER THE EBAY crash  --  the big one ? The wildly popular Web auctioneer of Pez , Pokemon and plain old junk went dark for 22 hours in early June , stranding millions of pack rats , derailing nearly $4 million in fees and erasing $5 billion in market value . Furious collectors bolted to rival sites , and some called for Chief Executive Meg C. Whitman 's head . <p> Days later a sleep-deprived Whitman called headhunter Robin Reed to plead for help . Ebay needed a crack troubleshooter to rebuild a computer system that had splintered and was mended for now with digital glue and string . Reed had just the guy : Maynard Webb , 43 , chief information officer at PC-maker Gateway in San Diego . <p> " Only about ten people could do this job , and Maynard was one of them , " Reed says . " He has the courage to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Seventeen days and dozens of phone calls later , Webb met with Whitman , who made him a bear hug of an offer : $450,000 in salary , a $108,000 sign-on bonus , an extra $300,000 if things went well  --  and options to buy 500,000 shares of Ebay 's recently battered stock . His salary is better than Whitman 's 1998 paycheck . <p> Webb , a hot property , had turned down lucrative offers in the past , but this time he succumbed . " I love jobs that other people run from , " he says . <p> Chances are , the fittingly named Webb will more than earn his pay . As e-commerce swells , shoring up the technology beneath it is more critical than ever before . In the Web 's early days ( say , four years ago ) shoppers gamely endured glitches . Now outages spark glaring headlines , cost millions in lost sales and prompt fed-up fans to buy elsewhere . <p> " For 15 years we 've talked about technology as a strategic advantage . At an e-commerce company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says George ( Rick ) Adam , the former top techie at Goldman , Sachs &; Co. who now runs New Era of Networks , Inc. , a maker of software tools . <p> Yet crashes on the Web occur all too often . Charles Schwab &; Co. helplessly watched its on-line trading site collapse five times this year , even though it was designed to serve 264,000 users at once and typically handled only one-quarter of that load . A faulty network card reportedly felled SecureTax.com , a popular tax-preparation site , four days before the April filing deadline . <p> " Too many companies still view technology as a necessary evil , " says Peter Solvik , chief information officer at Cisco Systems and mastermind of its roughly $13.5-billion-a-year Web sales operation . " Most chief information officers report to the chief financial officer , who sees it as a drain on the bottom line . " <p> For most Web sites , the supporting infrastructure is a fragile ecosystem of software , hardware and wiring . A small weakness in any part can cascade into a catastrophic event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of customers and keeps loading on more features to attract still more . <p> That pretty much is what hurt Ebay . The shop started modestly enough on Labor Day weekend in 1995 when founder Pierre Omidyar set it up to peddle his girlfriend 's collection of Pez dispensers . Today its computer system strains to serve 7.7 million users . Each minute 250 new items are listed , 700 bids are placed and 15 new members are registered . <p> Yet all of this relied on a single Sun Microsystems setup consisting of 16 processing units  --  and no backup . Ebay had outgrown its highest hopes . " It 's pretty typical of how these e-commerce companies have evolved . Ebay 's been around for four years , but it 's really been a company for only two , " says Whitman , who was a division president at Hasbro before taking the top job at Ebay in May 1998 . <p> In the eight months preceding the infamous blackout the site had gone through eight reported failures lasting from 90 minutes to at least six hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares , at $180 on June 10 when the lights went out , had fallen to $136 by the time service was restored ; they still have n't recovered . <p> Maynard Webb got a taste of the challenge early . Three weeks before his start date of Aug. 30 , Webb got a crisis call forcing him to abandon a house-hunting trip . Ebay 's site had crashed  --  again  --  and the cause was unclear . At the company 's San Jose , Calif. campus , Webb ducked an encampment of reporters to reach the engineers who were furiously working on a diagnosis . Finding the weak link is never easy . At 2 a.m . Webb staggered out the door , 13 hours after arriving . The culprit , it seems , was a software snag . <p> Webb came late to computers . The scrappy Floridian was a troublemaker who turned down a football scholarship at the U.S. Naval Academy to work at a construction job . Bored , he returned to school , took a part-time job at IBM in 1978 and in two years was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probe for security weaknesses . He wound up in Silicon Valley in 1991 , first at disk-drive maker Quantum and then at Bay Networks , where he salvaged a failing multimillion-dollar SAP installation in only nine months . That feat impressed Gateway , which hired Webb in 1998 to design its new sales site . <p> Then came Ebay . When Webb arrived Aug. 30 , a ban on new features was in place to try to avoid more shutdowns . His goal was modest  --  to reduce downtime rather than tackle the impossibility of eliminating outages altogether . Webb 's first order of business was to build a " warm backup , " a redundant system to take over when the main one failed . Ebay needed one for the more than 200 Windows NT servers that greet users , accept bids and process new members . It also needed a backup for the Sun server database that holds the more-than-3-million items listed for auction . Keeping the two systems synchronized would be tricky . <p> If it works , a system crash would keep Ebay down for no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement . Webb believes the June 10 crash " would have been a 3-hour event and not a 22-hour one , " had a warm backup been in place . Perfection , he says , is unattainable ; building a Web system is more art than science . <p> The next task : a " hot backup "  --  still more iron that could reduce any blackouts to less than an hour . All told , Ebay 's backbone will expand from the original Sun 16-unit system to a total of **26;1941;TOOLONG Sun Starfire servers  --  adding up to 64 processors . <p> That gets expensive : Ebay spent $18 million on tech staff and gear over the second and third quarters . Reflecting this drain , the percentage of profits it receives from its listing fees fell ten points from earlier in the year to 71% . " There 's always tension , " Webb says . " I tell the marketing guys that demand generation is always easier than demand fulfillment . " <p> The spending will continue through the end of the year . " We 're doubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to continue splitting the database , " Webb explains . <p> Yet new features continue to weigh down the system . Great Collections , a fine-arts auction , debuted on Oct. 19 . " That 's the equivalent of a whole new site , " Webb says . It was developed in three months , half the time a comparable project would take at a traditional company , he says . <p> His typical day starts at 4 : 30 a.m. with a 3-mile run . Webb reports for duty at 7 : 30 a.m. , stopping first at the company 's data center to check system performance . " I 'm spending less time putting out fires , " he says hopefully . Market research shows that most of the customers who fled Ebay have returned . The last major outage had been the ten-hour failure in early August ; on a recent day in late October Webb seemed almost relaxed . <p> Two days later he was in crisis mode again . Two successive days of lousy performance had forced him to take the system down and tweak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to diagnose the problem . This time a param-eter had n't been set on the database . " It was an internal problem , " Webb says tersely . This e-commerce stuff is a lot harder than it looks . Ebay 's Bungled Bids <p> Server shutdowns and sluggish service have plagued Ebay for months , outraging its customers and roiling its roller-coaster stock price . Since April a total of 11 significant disruptions ( red dots ) have occurred , embarrassing the Web auctioneer with a wave of negative media attention . It had warned before it went public in September 1998 that it " has experienced periodic system interruptions " that " will continue to occur from time to time .
