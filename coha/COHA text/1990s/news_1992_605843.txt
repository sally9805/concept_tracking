<p> People staying in rental cottages at Sandbridge , Va. , would pay a tax to help pay for beach replenishment under a bill that quietly passed the Virginia General Assembly this session . <p> The legislation gives the Sandbridge City Council permission to establish a special tax district in Sandbridge and tax rental cottages , many of them owned by Washington-area residents , up to 5 percent more on the existing 9.5 percent rate , said Robert Matthias , the city 's legislative liaison . Hotels , motels and campgrounds would be excluded . <p> If signed by Gov . L. Douglas Wilder and put into effect by the City Council , the legislation could help generate up to $ 550,000 a year to widen the Sandbridge beach , said the bill 's co-sponsor , Del . Glenn R. Croshaw ( D-Virginia Beach ) . Spending would be restricted to beach improvement or replenishment . <p> The statute could also put an end to wrangling between Sandbridge residents who want city money for beach widening , and supporters of more money for public schools . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate , " said Linwood Branch , former president of the city innkeepers ' association and a candidate in the May council election . <p> Council members Paul J. Lanteigne and Reba S. McClanan proposed the bill . McClanan is running against Meyera E. Oberndorf for mayor . <p> Lanteigne said he did n't know how the legislation will fare with the council . " It seems like the logical option that will allow tourists who use the beach to help pay for sand replenishment and take the burden off people in Kempsville , Bayside and Lynnhaven , " he said . <p> Oberndorf said the bill was not part of the council 's legislative package forwarded to the General Assembly . " It sounds interesting , " she said . " I look forward to hearing the details . " <p> A proposed , federally sponsored beach nourishment program would cost $ 10 million , Matthias said . The city would have to pay $ 3.4 million . The project would widen the 4 1/2-mile Sandbridge beach to about 110 feet , with a six-foot berm at midpoint . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public access to the beach , a requirement for federal participation in the project . <p> Of the 1,100 cottages in the Sandbridge area , about 500 are rental units , and 200 are on the ocean front . <p> The taxable value of residential property in Sandbridge is $ 188.5 million .

" <p> The study said " inadequate outreach activities " were a key reason why the savings banks received only a small number of applications and granted loans to these groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off accusations recently that lenders discriminate against low-income and minority communities . <p> Last fall , the Federal Reserve Board released a survey that showed banks , savings institutions and mortgage banking companies rejected 33.9 percent of home mortgage applications for blacks and 21.4 percent for Hispanics . <p> Rejection rates for whites were just 14.4 percent and 12.9 percent for Asian-Americans . The banking industry said it is disturbed with the findings but said the reports alone do not provide conclusive proof of racial discrimination . <p> State Superintendent of Banks Derrick D. Cephas suggested all state-owned banks and financial institutions should review their mortgage underwriting standards to ensure the rules are n't overly restrictive . <p> Banks also should provide a second review of all rejected mortgage applications and improve advertising and visibility in low-income and minority communities , Cephas said . <p> The study , which began in 1989 , examined the lending policies of Dollar Dry Dock Bank , Apple Savings Bank , Emigrant Savings Bank , Roosevelt Savings Bank , Ridgewood Savings Bank , River Bank America ; North Side Savings Bank , Eastchester Savings Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The study said Dollar , North Side , Roosevelt and Ridgewood all had " some aspect of their underwriting standards that could have had a disproportionately negative impact " on the groups . <p> CRI Inc. of Rockville is the largest owner of multifamily housing units in the country , topping the National Multi Housing Council 's NMHC 50 list .
