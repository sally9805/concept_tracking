<p> A panel of federal judges blocked enforcement of a new law barring " indecent " material on the Internet , saying that the First Amendment guarantee of free speech protected the worldwide computer network . <p> In trying to make sense of the free-for-all world of the Internet , a three-judge panel granted a preliminary injunction against the Communications Decency Act while two lawsuits wind through the court system . <p> The unanimous decision on June 12 , the first major judicial ruling on the Internet , was anxiously awaited by the government and the 57 groups challenging the act . The government has promised to appeal , taking the case directly to the U.S. Supreme Court for review . <p> " Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos , so the strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the First Amendment protects , " the judges wrote . <p> " That is good , sound - almost obvious - First Amendment law , " said attorney Robert D. Sack , a First Amendment specialist not involved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the people who drafted that statute knew that when they drafted it . " <p> Betty Turock , president of the American Library Association , one of the groups that brought the legal action , hailed the ruling as " a victory for librarians , everyone who uses libraries and and everyone who believes in free speech . " <p> The act 's supporters were undaunted . <p> " This was n't unanticipated with the direction and liberal leanings of these judges . We fully anticipated it going to the Supreme Court level , and ultimately we believe we 'll be victorious , " said Mike Russell , a spokesman for the Christian Coalition . <p> The act , enacted Feb. 8 as part of a behemoth overhaul of telecommunications legislation , makes displaying " indecent " or " patently offensive " words or images on the Internet punishable by $ 250,000 fines and a two-year prison sentence if they are accessible to minors . <p> With child pornography already illegal , the law was designed to keep nude pictures of adults off screens available to children . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , for one thing , much Internet material comes from overseas . <p> A key issue addressed by the judges was whether to extend the First Amendment rights enjoyed by the print media to the Internet , or to let it be regulated as broadcasters are . The judges granted " at least as much protection " as print . <p> " As the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed , the Internet deserves the highest protection from governmental intrusion , " the judges wrote . <p> The judges said any effort to stifle the unique medium would violate the Constitution . <p> " The Internet is a far more speech-enhancing medium than print , " the judges said . " Because it would necessarily affect the Internet itself , the CDA would necessarily reduce the speech available for adults on the medium . This is a constitutionally intolerable result . " <p> The major online services , all plaintiffs in the lawsuits , argued the law was so vague that they were unsure whether it covered materials that have serious literary , artistic or intellectual value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , works of art and popular culture , and could even affect news reports carried on the Internet . <p> Opponents had argued that the Internet should be classified as print media , which the courts have given wide latitude , reasoning that adults can provide their own censorship by merely declining to buy a publication . <p> The government , noting that Internet images flow on telecommunication lines , argued that it fits the definition of the broadcast media . Courts have allowed limitations on broadcast speech , saying technology restricts the number of stations and they are easily accessible to children . <p> The order also prohibits the government from enforcing a provision restricting speech about abortion on computer networks . But President Clinton , when he signed the law , said the Justice Department would never bring charges under the clause because a long line of Supreme Court decisions already had outlawed the restrictions . <p> In the only precursor to the decision , one of the three judges issued a temporary restraining order Feb. 15 that blocked part of the law , declaring the term " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government free to prosecute the " patently offensive " provisions , defined as online communication that " in context , depicts or describes in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards , sexual or excretory activities or organs . " <p> Although both sides found the decision confusing , Justice Department officials decided not to begin prosecuting violators until the case is decided . <p> The three-judge panel issuing the two-page order and accompanying 175-page opinion consisted of Dolores K. Sloviter , chief judge of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , and U.S. District Judges Ronald L. Buckwalter and Stewart Dalzell . <p> The law itself specified that an appeals judge and two federal district judges would review the law , and that if the government lost , the case would go directly to the Supreme Court . <p> The opinion was posted at several Internet sites , including the American Civil Liberties Union page at http : **32;481;TOOLONG . <p> Thirty years after the Freedom of Information Act was enacted , lawmakers and journalists testified it 's time to bring the law into the electronic age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOIA is not just a right to know what 's on paper records but applies equally to electronic records , " said Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , coauthor of a bill that would do just that . <p> Leahy called the act " one of the most significant tools Americans have to inform themselves about what their government is doing or not doing . " <p> Legislation that Leahy and Sen. Hank Brown , R-Colo. , introduced " would address the biggest single complaint of people making FOIA requests : delays in getting a response , " Leahy told a House subcommittee on June 13 . <p> " For some agencies , the delays can stretch to over two years . Long delays in access can mean no access at all , " Leahy said . <p> Leahy and Brown 's bill has been voted out of committee and is ready for a Senate vote . Rep. Steve Horn , R-Calif. , chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight subcommittee on government management , information and technology , said he plans to offer similar legislation in the House shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the FBI has a four-year wait " to provide requested documents , Horn said . <p> But J. Kevin O'Brien , who heads the FBI 's Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts section , said changing to electronic transmission of data would ease the physical work but not the mental processing . <p> " Great care is taken to ensure that no material to which the requester is entitled is erroneously withheld and that no material that should be withheld is inadvertently released , " he said . <p> That work , he said , " ca n't be sped up . " <p> At the end of May , the FBI had 15,259 requests on hand , including 248 involving about 2.6 million pages that must be reviewed , he said . <p> O'Brien said the average turnaround time of processed cases in 1995 was 923 days , or 2 years . The average time for all cases finished that year - including those in which no files were found - was 292 days , just under 10 months . The budget President Clinton proposed for 1997 seeks money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane E. Kirtley , executive director of The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , testified of " widespread failure of federal agencies to make records available . " She requested legislation mandating that electronic records be provided for FOIA requests . <p> Otherwise , Kirtley said , " Agencies will continue to refuse to provide electronic information to requesters and will deny them the opportunity to utilize the agency 's own enhanced ability to retrieve and analyze the records . " <p> Kirtley said the Clinton administration has ordered changes that make information more accessible . <p> But Byron York , investigative writer for The American Spectator , a politically conservative magazine , said he was stonewalled when he tried to find out how much was spent developing Vice President Al Gore 's plan to reinvent government . He got no response to two FOIA requests , he alleged . <p> Reporter Eileen Welsome recounted her difficulties in using the act to research a series for The Albuquerque Tribune on 18 people injected with plutonium during the Manhattan Project . That series won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department produced only a few insignificant documents . <p> " It was not a conspiracy so much as a complete lack of interest on the part of the bureaucrats whose job it was to dig out the documents , " Welsome testified . <p> It was n't until her newspaper 's attorneys became involved in August 1992 that the records started " to trickle in , " she said . Since then , many of them have been put on the Internet , available electronically . <p> Speaking on behalf of the Society of Professional Journalists , the American Society of Newspaper Editors and the Newspaper Association of America , Welsome encouraged passage of Leahy 's bill . <p> Journalists , Other Groups Protest Restrictions on Inmate Interviews <p> RANCHO CORDOVA , Calif . ( AP ) - Reporters , First Amendment groups and prisoner rights advocates denounced a proposed ban on face-to-face prisoner interviews . <p> Seventeen witnesses testified at a public hearing on June 13 against the state Department of Corrections regulations , which also would end the confidentiality of mail between prisoners and reporters . <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spokesman for the department acknowledged that it was unlikely any top officials would ever hear the public comments . <p> " It 's very disappointing to me that the department would even entertain the proposed restrictions on access that are being considered here today , " said Kelli Sager , a lawyer representing numerous media outlets , including the Los Angeles Times , ABC News and the San Francisco Chronicle . <p> " It is also very disappointing that the department considers this to be a public hearing , where the decision makers are not present , and as far as anybody here knows , will never bother to listen to the tape of this hearing or read any of the written comments , " she said . <p> Tony Lofton , a Corrections Department hearing officer , conducted the hearing . But Lofton does not have any input on the regulations , department spokesman Tip Kindel said . <p> The department has said the policy is needed for security reasons , to keep inmates from promoting antisocial policies and to prevent inmates from inflicting more distress on their victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society of Professional Journalists , the American Jewish Congress , advocates for prisoners with HIV or AIDS and prisoners with children , and the California First Amendment Coalition , which represents individuals , law firms and media organizations , including The Associated Press . <p> " The CDC 's proposal is aimed not at prison security or rehabilitation but at silencing news coverage that the CDC believes is bad for society at large , " said Martin Kassman of the American Jewish Congress . <p> " The CDC is entitled to its opinion , but in the United States of America , neither prison officials nor any other government officials can use their power to silence voices they 'd prefer the public not to hear . " <p> Kindel , who also attended a portion of the hearing , said a transcript will be made of the testimony and the department staff will respond to all of the comments . <p> But the senior administrators who decided to implement the policy will likely never see or hear the comments . <p> " The policy issues have already been decided , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearing that had not already been considered by the policy-makers , including questions of First Amendment rights . He acknowledged that the department had not sought out any media representatives or prisoner advocates when drawing up the regulations . He said the department was making prison policy , not media policy . <p> " The question is , what 's the proper way to deal with inmates in a prison setting ? " he said . " How do we deal with a special privilege that inmates had that makes no sense in relation to penological interests ? " <p> The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the media has no more right of access to prisoners than the general public , Kindel said . <p> " Prisoners have certain constitutional rights , but that 's different from being guaranteed that they will be interviewed in a certain way , " he said . <p> The traditional handshake marking the start of national contract talks between Chrysler Corp . and the United Auto Workers was delayed briefly because of the Detroit newspaper strike . <p> UAW President Stephen Yokich refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until a USA Today reporter left the room . USA Today is the flagship newspaper of Gannett Co . Inc. , parent of The Detroit News . <p> " We wo n't start negotiations , " Yokich said as cameras and reporters waited to record the ceremony . " It 's that serious . " <p> With that , reporter Micheline Maynard walked out . <p> The UAW has actively supported the strike against the News , the Detroit Free Press and Detroit Newspapers Inc. since 2,500 newspaper union workers walked out last July 13 . The papers have continued to publish with replacements and workers who have crossed the picket lines . <p> With agreement of the Big Three automakers , the UAW has banned the News and Free Press from contract-related news conferences in which the union is involved . <p> But Maynard , Detroit bureau chief for USA Today , said she had attended a similar ceremony at Ford Motor Co. headquarters on June 10 with the UAW 's knowledge and permission . She noted she does not work for the Detroit newspapers . <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room at Chrysler headquarters . " I 've got to do my job . I 've tried to be cooperative . " <p> Chrysler issued a brief statement saying that although it takes no position on the strike , conducting contract talks " in the most positive atmosphere possible " is more important . <p> " If excluding reporters from the two striking newspapers in joint situations is necessary to create that atmosphere , we believe it 's appropriate , " the company said . <p> The Big Three have said they will continue to provide access and information to the Detroit newspapers during bargaining . <p> At Ford on June 10 , a Free Press reporter voluntarily left after officials said he was not welcome . Ford officials allowed him to monitor the handshake ceremony and news conferences by telephone , however . <p> " During this entire 11-month strike , we have not asked anyone to take sides , " Free Press publisher Heath Meriwether said June 11 . " We simply asked everybody to be neutral and maintain the same business relationships with us they had before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked ( Ford ) to take sides . It sends mixed messages when they yield to union demands on an issue when a Ford union is not involved in the newspaper strike . " <p> News publisher Robert Giles said the News has good sources within the UAW and has had a number of background meetings with management . <p> " We 're up on top of the story , " he said . " This is simply nothing that 's going to make any difference in our coverage . " <p> On June 11 , thousands of delegates from the Communications Workers of America union in town for their national convention converged in front of Detroit newspaper buildings in support of the striking newspaper workers . <p> The next day , about 500 striking newspaper workers and supporters demonstrated at The Detroit News building , and 16 were arrested on disorderly conduct charges . <p> Baltimore Sun Writers Conduct Byline Strike <p> BALTIMORE ( AP ) - Reporters and writers at The Baltimore Sun conducted a one-day byline strike June 13 , refusing to put their names on their stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Employees are unhappy with the health-care package and a wage package that did not include a raise in the first year , according to a spokeswoman for The Newspaper Guild , which represents 650 of the newspaper 's 1,600 employees . <p> " The company is passing on its ( health care ) costs to employees but not giving them enough money and wages to be able to absorb that cost , " said union spokeswoman Connie Knox . <p> The union also objected to a company proposal that would allow management to deny pay raises to any newsroom employee . <p> The Guild contract expires June 22 . <p> Sun spokesman Michael L. Shultz said some wage and health-care packages have been agreed to by management and three other unions at the newspaper : the pressman 's union , the engraver 's union , and the Teamsters , who represent delivery drivers . <p> A total of six unions represent employees at the newspaper , which is owned by the Times Mirror Co . <p> The Guild contract covers advertising , printshop and custodial employees , electricians , carpenters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as writers , librarians , editorial assistants , photo technicians , and computer technicians . <p> Judge Orders Illinois to Release Scholarship Records <p> CHICAGO ( AP ) - Illinois must disclose the records of which legislators gave state university scholarships and who received them , a judge ruled in a suit brought by the Chicago Tribune . <p> Numerous examples of lawmakers giving scholarships to relatives , political friends and people outside their districts have been reported by The Associated Press and The News-Gazette of Champaign . The stories were based on partial records that have been available . <p> The scholarships , not tied to need or academic merit , cost state universities more than $ 4 million a year in waived tuition . <p> But lawmakers and education officials have refused repeated media requests to disclose most of the records , citing state and federal laws they say make the information private . <p> The Tribune sued the Illinois State Board of Education and the University of Illinois , seeking all legislative tuition waivers since 1992 . Their request was granted in a one-page summary judgment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oral arguments in the case . <p> James A. Klenk , an attorney for the Tribune , said state officials had been " dragging their feet " on releasing the information even though they were required to do so under the state 's Freedom of Information Act . <p> The order requires that the Tribune not ask for the information for 10 days . Klenk said that was to give state officials time to gather the records and file an appeal if they so choose . <p> Lee Milner , a spokesman for the board of education , said he was n't sure whether there would be an appeal . <p> University of Illinois spokesman Donald Coe said the university will ask an appeals court to delay release of the information while they appeal . <p> A 1905 state law allows lawmakers to give two four-year scholarships every year : one to the University of Illinois and one to the other nine state universities . Most lawmakers break down those scholarships into eight one-year or 16 one-semester awards . <p> The main restriction on the scholarships is that the student must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some scholarships apparently broke that rule , records indicate . <p> News reports on the scholarships stirred controversy during the spring legislative session . <p> Lawmakers passed a bill requiring the disclosure of the names of students who get the scholarships , and Gov . Jim Edgar is considering whether to strengthen it by adding addresses . <p> Southern Illinois University has hired a former federal prosecutor to investigate how some of the scholarship records were released to the AP with some students ' names still readable , despite the school 's efforts to strike them out . <p> A judge threw out a lawsuit by a man who claimed U.S. News and World Report illegally profited by selling his name to junk mail advertisers . <p> Judge William T. Newman Jr . ruled that Ram Avrahami had no property rights to a fake name he used on a subscription form so he could track whether the magazine sold his name . Avrahami deliberately misspelled his name " Avrahani . " <p> " He is not a victim . He is a trickster , " said David G. Fiske , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $ 5,000 in punitive damages and an order barring the magazine from distributing his name . He claimed that junk mail caused him anxiety and inconvenience . <p> " I can not be happy , " he said of the June 11 ruling . " No one can be happy with the court saying your name is worth nothing . " <p> In claiming that his name has monetary value , Avrahami cited a Virginia law barring the sale of a name for commercial purposes without permission . The magazine countered that the law was intended to protect celebrities from the misappropriation of their names or likenesses . <p> Fiske also ridiculed Avrahami for complaining about his privacy being violated while waging a well-publicized legal battle against the magazine . <p> Woman Awarded $ 48.7 Million in Patent Infringement Lawsuit <p> Eds : Sharen in 2nd graf is cq . <p> DETROIT ( AP ) - A federal jury awarded $ 48.7 million to an Iowa woman who claimed that Flint Ink Corp . infringed on her patent for a soybean-based ink formula . <p> The monthlong trial ended June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for patent infringement , $ 28.8 million for unjust enrichment and $ 15 million for breach of contract . <p> Officials with the Detroit-based company said June 17 they expect to appeal the case , pending the outcome of several post-trial motions . <p> " She had an idea and somebody took it , and they made a lot of money taking and using her idea , " said Raymond Niro , one of Brower 's attorneys . <p> Brower , 46 , a substitute teacher and part-time artist from Newell , Iowa , sued Flint Ink in 1993 . Three years earlier , she disclosed her idea to the company but never gave it permission to market the product , according to her attorneys . <p> Brower discovered her ink product in 1988 while trying to find a soy ink medium that could be used for paintings , Niro said .

( AP ) - Two people sexually abused by a former Bradenton Herald editor sued the newspaper for negligence , saying officials " knew or should have known " that children were being molested in the paper 's offices . <p> The lawsuit , filed June 11 , claims the newspaper was negligent in hiring and supervising former graphics editor Ted Schultz . It seeks more than $ 15,000 in damages . <p> Schultz was fired in February 1994 after prosecutors charged him with 89 counts of illegal sexual activity with children . He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to life in prison . <p> The suit said Schultz invited his victims to the newspaper 's offices . <p> " He provided them with alcohol , illegal drugs and loud music and thereby created an atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the suit said . <p> Former publisher Dorothy S.
