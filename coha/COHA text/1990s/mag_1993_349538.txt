Proper appreciation of Richard Leakey 's career requires a course in ballistics . Since he brashly launched his first expedition in search of human fossils in 1964 at the age of 19 , he has careered through the African landscape , colliding at different times with his parents and siblings , with rival scientists over the interpretation of discoveries , and with other conservationists over his adamant support of a ban on the ivory trade . <P> But these collisions were nothing compared with what happened last month in the rough country north of Nairobi . A single-engine Cessna that Leakey was piloting with four passengers aboard lost power and crash-landed . " It occurred to me that if I did not handle the crash correctly , there would be no survivors , " recalled Leakey , speaking last week from a hospital bed in Nottingham , England . " So I told the passengers in as lighthearted a way as possible that they were going to have to find their own way from this point on , looked for friendly trees to hit , turned off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not see one stout old mango tree . " Leakey suffered worse injuries than any of his passengers : shattered bones in both legs and ankles . <P> The days following the crash showed both the depth of Leakey 's courage and the strength of his commitment to saving African wildlife . Hour after hour , he lay in pain in a Nairobi hospital that could not adequately deal with the infections he developed . Septicemia posed a mortal risk , as he had only one kidney ( transplanted from his brother years ago after both kidneys failed ) . But for 10 days he refused to leave Kenya to receive better treatment . Ignoring pleas from friends and family , he decided he had to stay in Nairobi to oversee the receipt of part of a $155 million conservation aid package from an international group of donors led by the World Bank . <P> Leakey finally agreed to be evacuated when British bone specialist Christopher Colton helped convince him that his life was in danger . As it is , he may yet lose part of his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his kidney problems , he faces medical bills that may mount to $500,000 . <P> The second son of famed paleontologists Louis and Mary Leakey , Richard first burst into global prominence in 1972 when his team in Kenya unearthed a beautifully preserved 1.9 million-year-old skull of Homo habilis , an early hominid species first discovered by his parents . Ian Tattersall , an anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City , observes that the younger Leakey has more than his share of luck . " Louis Leakey had to crawl over hot rocky outcrops for 30 years before he found anything of importance ; Richard struck gold from the start . " Roger Lewin , collaborator on three of Richard 's seven books , points out that his larger- than-life personality , amplified by coverage in National Geographic magazine and a 1977 TIME cover , raised the profile of paleoanthropology , helping ensure the flow of funds to its practitioners . " You ca n't do anything without fossils , " says Lewin , " and he helped make it possible for fossils to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
