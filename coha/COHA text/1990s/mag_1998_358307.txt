" Mom , I 'm scared . " The uncharacteristically anxious words came out of Tara Lipinski less than two hours before her final program . Uncharacteristic because her legend is so well known : a toddler , transfixed by the star-spangled anthem blaring from the TV , stages her own Olympic ceremony  --  with an overturned Tupperware container for a podium , some ribbon and dried flowers . <P> On Friday , over a meal of spaghetti in her parents ' hotel room , the 15-year-old just wanted her mother 's comfort . " It 's O.K. to be scared . It 's good to be scared , " said Pat Lipinski . " But you can do it . " After that , Tara was back in character and on the way to an upset and the fulfillment of a legend  --  not just the gold medal but the record as the youngest Olympic figure-skating champion ever . To do that she had to overcome a rival whose eloquence on ice had moved judges to tears . Michelle Kwan , just 17 herself , had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance between technical perfection and blossoming artistry , a tiny confection of a girl showed the world that she would be queen . <P> First , though , Lipinski had to survive the short program , a 2-min. 40-sec. contest in which one misstep , one deviation from the eight required elements can mean instant elimination . Nicole Bobek , 20 , was out in under a minute : she hit the ice during her first triple Lutz and never recovered , taking with her the talk of a red-white-and-blue sweep . The world offered up its best  --  Russian siren Maria Butyrskaya , China 's comeback kid Chen Lu and French wonder woman Surya Bonaly  --  but one competitor , Elena Sokolova , voiced what everyone knew : " It 's really between Tara and Michelle . " <P> At a loss to articulate the mechanics of her whirlwind style , Lipinski once said , " I just rotate . " In a fairy-tale blue-and-yellow frock , she flew to the Anastasia sound track , whipping through her triple flip , exploding into a grin that dwarfed her 80-lb. frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17-year-old veteran showed that having soul as well as legs counts . Kwan drew out the chords of Rachmaninoff 's Piano Concerto No. 3 in D Minor into a smooth legato line as she flowed , left leg extended , straight toward the panel of judges . When she emerged from that , the audience and judges had swooned , and Kwan had gold in her sights . Eight of nine judges placed her first . <P> Going into the final 4-min. free skate , the message was clear : just rotating would n't be enough . Could Lipinski rise to Kwan 's level of artistry ? A judicial preference for maturity on ice certainly decided the bronze , claimed by the elegant Chen , 21 . Bonaly , who might have been a contender , knew that judges have little appreciation for her muscular acrobatics . " The judges are n't pleased with anything I do anyway , " she said . So , in her long program , she gave the judges figure skating 's equivalent of the finger : an illegal back flip . Take that ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
