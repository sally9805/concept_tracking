A group work program was developed for low-income , minority patients of a primary care medical setting who were misusing medical resources to work on psychosocial issues . Multiple groups were established using an action-oriented approach to enhance patients ' ability to cope with health , mental health , and environmental problems . The program was demonstrated to be beneficial for the participants and the primary care clinic . <p> The benefit of group work in health settings has been cited as an effective way to help patients " cope with the emotional distress and changes in social living occasioned by the illness or disability " ( Northen , 1983 , p. 112 ) . Groups are also effective in diminishing somatization , in educating patients as to the interconnectedness between their psychosocial problems and their physical symptoms , and in decreasing unnecessary patient visits to primary providers ( Clarke , Neuwirth , &; Bernstein , 1986 ) . Patients can also learn social action and self-advocacy skills that can be used on their own in the future ( Fabricant , 1986 ; Garvin , 1981 ; Garvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1982 ; Hardy-Fanta 1986 ; Northen , 1983 ) . <p> The group setting enhanced work with low-income black and Hispanic patients of a primary care clinic in a large urban teaching hospital . The goal of the groups , led by the hospital 's social work staff , was to help members cope with chronic health , mental health , and environmental problems . The use of groups in primary care settings will be described , both as they benefit the individual patient and increase the responsiveness of the clinic to meet the needs of the population it serves . THE PRIMARY CARE CLINIC AND ITS PATIENTS <p> Internal Medicine Associates ( IMA ) opened in 1980 as a primary care practice of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City to replace the general medical clinic . The aim was to improve the hospital 's quality of care and services . The clinic , bordering East Harlem , serves mainly a black and Hispanic poor and working-poor population that is exposed daily to crime , drug abuse , domestic violence , and poverty . Thus , patients are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> IMA provides comprehensive health and mental health services with a particular emphasis on accessibility , continuity , and coordination of patient care ( Clarke et al. , 1986 ) . This is accomplished through the use of consistent teams of doctors , nurses , and social workers who collaborate on managing patients ' biopsychosocial needs . Patients ' problems are addressed at weekly team meetings and through informal collaboration . Medical assistants and receptionists often are included in collaborative efforts . SOCIAL WORK 'S ROLE IN PRIMARY CARE <p> Many patients seen by the primary care physician have psychosocial stressors requiring attention and treatment ( Brochstein , Adams , Tristan , &; Cheney , 1979 ; Mechanic , 1980 ; Wilson &; Setturland , 1986 ) . These include conflict-filled interpersonal relationships ; financial , entitlement , and housing problems ; and alcohol and drug abuse problems . Many patients also have difficulty coping with chronic illnesses that affect their ability to perform daily activities and comply with the medical regimen . In addition , some patients have preexisting psychiatric problems exacerbated by these stressors . Particular attention must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinic medical resources from which they benefit little . <p> The IMA social worker , as the primary mental health provider , coordinates the patient 's mental health services , including making psychosocial evaluations ; establishing treatment priorities ; and providing individual , family , or group treatment . Just as the medical provider minimizes the fragmentation of medical services , the social worker , acting as case manager , reduces the fragmentation of mental health services . The liaison psychiatrist can be called upon as a consultant when necessary ( Clarke et al. , 1986 ) . <p> Offering mental health services within a primary care setting increases the likelihood of the early detection of patients ' psychosocial problems that have an impact on health . Locating mental health services in the primary care clinic also reduces the stigma associated with referring patients to mental health professionals and enhances the responsiveness of the primary health care system to patient needs ( Borus , 1976 ; Clarke et al. , 1986 ; Coleman &; Patrick , 1976 ; Gropper , 1987 ; Mechanic , 1980 ; Nason &; Delbanco , 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GROUPS <p> The primary care clinic , providing comprehensive medical care , emphasizes preventive health and health promotion services ( Deuschle &; Bosdh , 1981 ) , making it a natural setting for using the group method . The group work model used at IMA focuses on the prevention and management of health and mental health problems and on enhancing the patient 's ability for change . Group members live in economically deprived neighborhoods and often feel overwhelmed and powerless because options for changing their life situation are limited . The IMA groups empower patients with insight into maladaptive behaviors and tools to alter interpersonal and environmental problems . The groups also help patients become active participants by helping them identify what can be changed in their lives and by helping them to change it . Helping patients cope with and adapt to what can not be changed is another benefit . <p> Whereas some patients can use an individual treatment approach to work on psychosocial problems , others find that individual treatment accentuates their loneliness and isolation . For patients less verbally oriented , who may express their psychological distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment , the groups can provide opportunities to develop socialization skills , social networks , and sharing of experiences and insights . <p> Eight groups have been developed since the clinic opened , serving about 150 patients . Specific groups have formed to help patients cope with chronic medical problems , such as asthma and human immunodeficiency virus infection . To decrease the anxiety that results in psychosomatic symptoms , stress management groups for men and women have been developed . Women 's groups for isolated elderly , for middle-aged women who are at " loose ends " as their children leave home , and for women with chronic medical and psychiatric disorders have formed to provide support and mutual aid networks . Environmental issues have been addressed in the Housing Advocacy group , which teaches self-advocacy techniques . Recruiting Group Members <p> To ensure the group 's success , both staff and patients need to be engaged in the pregroup planning process . During weekly meetings , and through informal discussions with medical and ancillary staff , the benefits of the group program for clinic patients are described . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewing it as a resource to be used with medical treatment for patients ' biopsychosocial concerns . As each new group is formed , the social worker describes the group 's specific purpose and the appropriate population for referral , facilitating recruitment of patients to the group . <p> Patients can either be referred for group membership by primary care team members or they can be chosen from the social worker 's caseload or through self-referral . Once a group is formed , patients are identified as candidates according to core problem , age , and the patients ' needs and interests . Groups are led in English and Spanish to accommodate the client population . <p> A mutual screening process begins as patients are offered the opportunity to become group members . It has been observed that establishing a close and personal relationship with potential group members before introducing the concept of the group is important , especially among Hispanic patients because of their distrust of " impersonal structures and organizations " ( Delgado , 1983 , pp. 510-511 ) . Therefore , patients new to the mental health services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before introduction into the group to familiarize them with what the group can offer . The screening period allows participants to develop an alliance with the social worker that increases the possibility of making a successful transition into the group . Additionally , patients are able to make an informed decision about whether the group will be helpful for them . The social worker can also assess the potential member 's fit with a particular group . <p> The screening process must explore a member 's expectation , concerns , and anxieties in joining . Some members may hope unrealistically for a quick resolution of their problems by joining the group , whereas others may disparage any attempt at resolution because their efforts have failed in the past . The leader 's task is to help the . patient come to a realistic expectation of how he or she can benefit from participation . <p> Because many of the groups have been running for several years , they are highly cohesive and both existing group members and newcomers may have ambivalent feelings about the entry of new members into the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the newcomer examine these feelings to ease transition into the group . Group Dynamics <p> The groups ' goal is to help patients gain a sense of control over their health problems and the multiple psychosocial stressors they face . The group environment lends itself to sharing common experiences , which can decrease a patient 's isolation and increase a sense of belonging . As bonds are strengthened , the group becomes a safe environment for participants to begin trusting members with more intimate feelings . It is crucial for the leader to foster communication among the participants and reinforce members ' ability to help one another . If handled successfully , this enables members to more freely address concerns and issues . For example , after several months of attending the Empty Nest group , which was developed for middle-aged women whose children have left home , Joan revealed that her difficulty in trusting group members stemmed from an earlier time when she was abandoned by family and friends after she suffered a psychotic episode . The leader encouraged Joan to talk about this traumatic incident and helped members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turning point for Joan , who was provided with a corrective experience when the group embraced her with her problem . The moment was a turning point for the group as well , who saw itself uniting behind a member in pain . <p> Group members also gain a stronger sense of their own competence as the group leader reinforces the knowledge and life experience that each member brings to the group . Sam , a well-respected member of his community , entered the Housing Advocacy group in a frustrated state as his previous attempts at self-advocacy regarding his dilapidated , unsafe apartment had failed . This short-term group links patients with community leaders who attend meetings to give advice and teach self-advocacy skills as patients work toward alleviation of a problem-filled housing situation . In the initial session of the group , Sam 's knowledge of community resources was reinforced by the leader , and his self-esteem was enhanced as he saw the benefit others derived from his knowledge . <p> Members ' strength as " advisers " was reinforced when Francine of the Empty Nest group asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The group invited Francine 's daughter to help her find ways to manage her adolescent son , who was acting out . Before this consultation session , the leader instructed the group to role-play advising Francine 's daughter on her son 's problems . The consultation session then was an exciting one as these women , who were experiencing the loss of their " careers " as mothers and questioning their competence in the nurturing role , were again able to use their parenting skills in a helpful way . This session validated the importance of their life experience for the group . <p> The safe environment created in the group promotes self-expression , interaction , and an interdependence among members , which mirrors the interdependence of family members . This is especially important for Hispanic clients , who are unaccustomed to working on problems outside the family network . The Men 's Stress Management group was created to promote this interdependence among members . The focus is to help group members understand the body 's response to internal distress and external problems through dance therapy and social group-work processes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through discussion and dancing , when body movements become tools for self-expression . Patients are motivated to join the group when they learn that it specifically addresses their multiple somatic complaints . <p> For example , Raul , a 65-year-old Hispanic man , suffered from frequent asthma attacks , related to severe feelings of anxiety caused by his marital problems . He accepted referral to the group when he was able to view it as a vehicle to control his asthma attacks . Through the group processes , Raul came to understand the connection between his frequent asthma attacks , his anxiety , and his marital problems . The group has now progressed from one that initially focused on physical symptoms and ways to cope with physical pain and distress , to one that deals with both the physical and emotional pain members experience . <p> A sense of security and safety within groups evolves as a group culture and norms develop . Within the Women 's Socialization group , which includes patients with both medical and psychiatric chronic illnesses , members initially avoided unpleasant subjects and feelings . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was evident that this inability also posed difficulties for them-outside the group . Their lack of assertiveness resulted in their feeling powerless and overwhelmed . A turning point occurred when the leader helped one member recognize her chronic anger within the group . With the leader 's encouragement , members discussed the difficulty of managing this emotion and realized the value of expressing it . Over time , the expression of what had previously been viewed as " taboo " became a group norm . The ability to express their feelings then enhanced a sense of control over daily events and lessened feelings of victimization for group members . <p> The group program also can empower patients who manifest anxiety through somatic complaints . For example , members of the Stress Management group learned to distinguish between symptoms of an illness versus unpleasant sensations triggered by anxiety . Patients were taught specific stress management exercises in the safety of the group that they could practice at home . One member shared with the group that after an argument with her husband , she developed tightness in her chest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember a breathing exercise she had learned in the group and used this tool to decrease unpleasant sensations . With these stress management tools , this patient and others are better able to rely on their internal resources to decrease their distress . In this way , unnecessary visits to the emergency room are avoided . <p> For many of these patients , whose opportunities for social interaction are limited , the groups provide an opportunity to learn to socialize . These skills are then transferred outside the group , both as members socialize with each other apart from the group setting and as they are better able to establish friendships with others in their community . Phyllis , referred by her doctor for evaluation of depression and anxiety , revealed that she was isolated and lonely , without friends and activities outside the home . The leader stepped back and encouraged Empty Nest group members to take a more active role in supporting Phyllis , who joined a literacy class . Members continued their supportive relationships outside the group as they tutored Phyllis to help her manage the most difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a newspaper to the group to demonstrate her newly acquired skills . She also was able to use the socialization skills she learned in the group to establish friendships in her class . <p> Another way patients learn to socialize better is by developing an awareness of maladaptive behavior and modifying it . Mary , an 86-year-old with a severe hearing deficit who attends the Senior Socialization group , correctly sensed that people withdrew from her . During initial group sessions , Mary monopolized the group discussion and appeared distracted and withdrawn when others spoke . The members , using the social worker as a model , pointed out this behavior and learned that what appeared to be disinterest was in fact self-consciousness about her hearing deficit . Mary learned that because she felt alienated , her behavior was alienating group members , as well as others with whom she had contact . Her behavior in the group changed markedly after this ; she not only listened and empathized as members talked , but also was able to engage in the give and take of group discussion and ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed as an effective means of involving patients in working to alleviate the effects of psychosocial stressors in their lives . It is often difficult for poor minority clinic patients to take an active role in their medical care and in changing problem-filled daily living conditions , as a sense of powerlessness prevails . However , many patients quickly become engaged and committed to the goals of the group and to the mutual support system that is established . <p> The groups developed in this setting are action oriented to encourage and enhance patients ' ability to become active participants : to take charge and manage health , mental health , and environmental problems . Patients carry these insights and skills to all aspects of their daily lives . The social workers as group leaders are role models , facilitators , teachers , skill builders , and promoters of change . Patients who have historically attended mental health appointments erratically attend group sessions regularly . Group leaders observe the changes members make as the group helps them to connect stress in their lives with somatic symptoms , freeing them to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more assertive in their interactions with family , friends , and the community as they learn self-advocacy skills in the group . <p> The program also is an effective and efficient model that benefits the clinic as a whole ; the primary care providers view it as a valued resource . Team members enthusiastically report a decrease in the anxiety and depression level of some group members and a decrease in use of tranquilizers among the group population . The location of the group work program and mental health services within the clinic decreases patients ' misuse of medical appointments for psychosocial problems and increases the coordination of care among health and mental health providers . <p> The group program has reached out to patients who otherwise might not have felt comfortable working on psychosocial issues and has become an integral part of the overall biopsychosocial treatment plan . It can be adapted to a variety of health care settings to help patients cope with illness , learn socialization and self-advocacy , and establish mutual aid networks . <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
