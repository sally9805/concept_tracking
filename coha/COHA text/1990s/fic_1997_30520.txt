I sat on my living room sofa at five o'clock in the morning with a copy of the mock-up of the front page of the day 's New York Post in my hand , looking at my own obituary . The headline I was reading had been prepared hours earlier , when the cops thought that it was my head that had been blown apart by a rifle blast on a quiet country road in a little Massachusetts town called Chilmark . SEX PROSECUTOR SLAIN  --  FBI , STATE TROOPERS JOIN SEARCH FOR KILLER Mike Chapman sat opposite me as he worked on his second egg sandwich and lukewarm cup of coffee . He had brought them along with the news story , and in the fashion of an experienced Homicide detective he continued chewing even as he described to me the details of the murder scene  --  bullet holes , blood spatter , and body bag . " Good thing you 've been a source for so many stories at the Post all these years . It 's a very complimentary obit ... " He stopped eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , " And a great picture of you  --  looks like they airbrushed most of your wrinkles out . Your phone 'll be ringing off the hook once all those lonely guys in the city realize you 're still alive  --  maybe you 'll get lucky . " Most of the time Mike could defuse every situation and get me to laugh , but I had been crying for so many hours that it was impossible to respond to his lousy cracks or to focus on anything else but the dreadful day that lay ahead . A woman had been killed on the path leading to my country house , driving a car that had been rented in my name . The body of the tall , slender , thirtyish victim was missing her face , so most of the local cops who arrived on the scenll the questions . " " Just talk to me , Alex . " Reliving the events of the past few hours as a witness and not a prosecutor was an unsettling role for me . I tried to reconstruct what had happened after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the answering machine to play back the messages as I started to undress . Beep one : " Hi , Alex . I 'm on the Ventura Freeway , taking the baby to his play group . Tell me more about the case with the therapist who seduced his patient . It sounds fascinating . How many people do you think he 's fucked up ? Speak with you later . " Nina Baum , my college roommate , still my best friend , making her regular phone car call from one of the endless L.A. roadways on which she seemed to spend her life Beep two : Just the deliberate click of a hang-up call . Beep three : " Yo , Coop . Wallace here . The lieutenant asked me to give you a heads up . The Con Ed rapist hit again today . Nothing for you to do now . Lady 's been to the hospital and released , so we put her to bed for the night . You do the same , and we 'll be down at your office tomorrow . Behave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace , formerly of Homicide , who was now my lead detective in the Special Victims Squad , the unit which investigated all of the sexual assault and child abuse cases that occurred in Manhattan . Beep four : " I 'm trying to reach a friend or next-of-kin to Alexandra Cooper . This is an emergency . Please call me , Chief Wally Flanders , Chilmark Police  --  Martha 's Vineyard . It 's urgent  --  give a call as soon as you get this message . Area code 508-555-3044 . Thanks . " Of course I had known Wally for more than a decade  --  I had been going to the Vineyard since I had been in law school , and Wally was as much a local fixture as the fishing boats and the general store . I picked up the phone to dial , wondering why he was looking for a friend or relative at my apartment instead of asking for me . When he got on the line , he expressed how surprised he was to hear my voice . " Where are you ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief . " " Well , Alex , there 's been a terrible tragedy here . Terrible . Was there somebody stayin ' at your house , somebody you let use it ? " " Yes , Wally , a friend of mine is there . It 's okay , she 'll be staying there for a week or two . It 's no problem , I 've arranged everything . " My mind was racing but I had never connected the Vineyard with any kind of crime problem except the occasional house burglary . That 's why it has always been such a refuge for me , a world away from the grim business of investigating and prosecuting rape cases . Someone must have noticed an unfamiliar person coming or going into Daggett 's Pond Way and suspected a burglary . " Not so easy , Alex . Your friend is n't staying for as long as you thought . She was shot sometime tonight , see , and my guys found the body a few hours ago . She 's dead , Alex , real dead . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the telephone mouthpiece . I was incredulous , as people always are when they get this kind of news . And as intimately as I have worked with violence and murder for more than ten years , it had never ruptured the fragile line that separated my personal from my professional life . " Alex ? Alex ? Are you alone there ? " " Yes . " " Can you get someone over to give you a hand with this ? " With what ? I thought . What else could anyone do except stare at me while I spun out of control ? Wally continued , " See , the big problem is that we thought it was you who got killed . That 's why we were tryin ' to find your family , for notification . The press already thinks you 're the dead woman . " " How did that happen ? " I shrieked at him . " Well , it 's really ugly . We figure that you  --  I mean she was riding in a convertible , top down  --  and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that leads in to your house . Someone must have been waiting in there foryou , and  --  excuse me  --  just let out a blast which hit her square in the side of her head . " I do n't suppose Wally could hear me but I was sitting on my bedroom floor , crying as he finished his story . " We had a call during the evening to go up to the Patterson house , out your way . My boys found the body  --  could n't tell much about anything from looking at her and she did n't have no ID . They called in the license plate and found that the Mustang had been rented in your name . Hell it was your driveway , a rented car , and a girl with a similar build and size  --  it made sense that it was you . " " I guess so , " I whimpered back to him . " Well I 'm glad it 's not you , Alex . Everyone will be glad to know it 's not you . I figured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down every pervert and madman you 've sent to jail . That 's why I called in the FBI  --  I figured we 'd be huntin ' all over the place . " Wally actually laughed a few times at that point . " It 's a relief , really , I guess the off-island papers wo n't even bother with us now . " The chief had no idea how wrong he was and how bad this was going to be for that tranquil little island . " Can you help us , Alex ? Can you give us her name and who to notify ? " &lt; p&gt;I mumbled the name into the phone , but Wally heard it loud and clear . " Isabella Lascar . " The news wires were about to explode with the information that the face of the dazzlingly beautiful actress and film star , Isabella Lascar , had been obliterated , and that what was left of her body lay in the tiny Vineyard morgue , with a toe tag mislabeled in the name of Alexandra Cooper .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
