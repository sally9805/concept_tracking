Orrin Hatch can play with your head . As stiff as his white-collared shirts , a Rocky Mountain version of American Gothic , the Mormon Senator nonetheless makes nice with the Beltway Philistines . He flirts , brags endlessly about the Utah Jazz , fights Jesse Helms on his anti-aids legislation and is pals with Ted Kennedy . He writes love songs to his wife during long committee hearings and recorded an album of hymns , although he says he does n't go crooning religious songs along the Potomac , as his good friend Ken Starr does . But that 's one of the few ways in which he diverges from the independent counsel . As one of the frequent communicants at the altar of the Sunday-morning talk shows , Hatch has made it his mission to defend the judge . He 's the James Carville of the right on the subject . <P> So when the President lashed back at the out-of-control prosecutor on Monday night , the lay minister who prides himself on his composure was suddenly out of control . Hatch appeared on five networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consecutive Appearances in a Single Day , held by William Ginsburg . The screen went dark in the Map Room , and almost immediately there was Hatch on NBC threatening , " I 'm just going to blow my stack " if he hears another word against Starr . His stack gone , he moved over to CNN , where he threatened to blow his " cork " if the phrase " $40 million " ( as in " $40 million investigation " ) was repeated again . On the air , he said he was " personally offended " by Clinton 's attack ; in the hallway , he called the President a " jerk " ( as close to a four-letter epithet as Hatch ever gets ) . Salt Lake Tribune reporter John Heilprin , shadowing Hatch , reported that his press secretary praised the usually placid Senator : " Stay passionate , Orrin . That 's good . " <P> Weeks ago , Hatch made an offer of consideration for confession , which he repeated in some form in virtually every TV appearance . My first reaction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of negotiating the terms of surrender . My second was to wonder exactly how much contrition he wanted , on a scale from Nixonian modified hangout to a full Jimmy Swaggart , from something suitable for family viewing to a blushing Playboy-channel disclosure . Hatch made a direct appeal to Clinton when he crossed paths with one of the President 's spokesmen at NBC 's green room in Washington . Hatch said he meant what he said , that he would do whatever he could to help the President if he would just come forward , stop the stonewalling and let up on Starr . Repent and slam no more . <P> Whether or not Hatch would have told Starr to shut down his investigation or urged Republicans to cease talk of impeachment if Clinton had followed his instruction , it was too late by speech time . The President had little left to lose . By being forced to testify , he 'd given up just about everything . He 'd raised the white flag on the Truman balcony , opened the gates to the enemy . Starr and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about extramarital sex while his daughter was in her room upstairs . Not only had Starr forced Clinton to come clean with his wife and daughter privately , he also made him do it before the whole country while they watched , a high price even for such reprehensible conduct .
