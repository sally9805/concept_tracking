Chapter One&lt; You 're a woman , Miss Wainwright . Give me your honest opinion . " Sam Stark paused briefly to drink from the glass of brandy in his hand . " Do you think it was the prenuptial agreement that spooked her ? " Desdemona Wainwright followed Stark 's gaze . His attention was fixed on an object two floors below his study window . She had an uneasy feeling that he was brooding on the three large ice swans that were presently melting on the lawn of his austere garden . By now her staff had probably finished clearing away most of the evidence of the abruptly cancelled wedding reception . Fifteen pounds of cold tortellini salad , two hundred miniature asparagus tarts , three platters of herbed goat cheese , and a hundred and fifty spring rolls had no doubt been loaded back into the Right Touch Catering van . The cake , an elaborate five-tiered affair decorated with palest mauve and creamy white roses , would have been safely stowed in its special carrying crate . But the ice swans were a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be getting quite slippery The swans would definitely be a write-off . Desdemona had taken an assessing glance at them as she had hurried to follow Stark into the concrete , steel , and glass fortress he called home . The swans ' beaks had already begun to droop , and their tail feathers were blurred . Even if rushed immediately back to the Right Touch freezer , they could n't be salvaged . Desdemona knew there was no way she could save them to use at the charity event her small business was scheduled to cater on Tuesday . A dead loss , just like the Stark-Bedford wedding . The easiest thing to do with the massive ice sculptures was to let them remain where they were until the late spring sun dissolved them . It would n't take long , a couple of days , perhaps . Seattle was enjoying a rare streak of sunny weather . But Desdemona felt a pang of guilt at the thought of leaving the swans behind in Stark 's coldly elegant garden . It seemed a bit callous to stick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience he had endured this afternoon . Especially since she was in the process of trying to stick him with the tab for the expensive debacle as well . Desdemona set her jaw determinedly . She must not allow her natural empathy to weaken her resolve . She could not afford to be swayed by sympathy . There was too much cash at stake . She had gone way out on a financial limb to handle the Stark-Bedford reception . She struggled to find a diplomatic response to Stark 's question . " I could n't say whether or not Miss Bedford was concerned about a prenuptial agreement , " Desdemona said gently . She leaned forward until she was sitting on the very edge of her chair . She kept an eye on Stark 's incredibly broad shoulders , making certain that he did not turn around as she reached across his glass and steel desk . Quickly she edged Pamela Bedford 's apologetic note aside . Then she carefully positioned the catering invoice so that Stark would be sure to see it when he came back to his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attention still on the swans . " I 've always made it a practice to conduct a detailed failure analysis when things have gone wrong . " " Failure analysis ? " " It 's standard procedure after a disaster . " " Oh . I see . " Desdemona cleared her throat . " Well , it 's not really any of my business , Mr. Stark . I 'm just the caterer . Now , then , I believe my invoice is completely self-explanatory . If you 'd care to look it over ? " " I made it clear right from the start that there would be one . " Stark braced one big hand on the windowsill and continued to study the swans down below . " A failure analysis ? " " A prenuptial agreement . Do you think she thought I 'd change my mind at the last minute ? " " I have no idea , Mr. Stark . " After a couple of seconds of further consideration , Desdemona reached across the desk again and flipped Pamela 's short note facedown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to freeze the tortellini salad . And I do n't have another menu featuring asparagus tarts scheduled for this week . I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to charge you for everything that Miss Bedford ordered . " " Damn it , what the hell was so unreasonable about asking her to sign a prenuptial agreement ? What did she expect me to do ? Did she actually think I 'd trust her to stick around for the next fifty years ? " The bleak outrage in Stark 's voice made Desdemona turn to stare , astonished , at his broad back . She realized he was genuinely baffled by his ex-fiance 's behavior . Amazing . The man was reputed to be brilliant . She had overheard one of the wedding guests refer to him as a human computer . But apparently he was quite dense when it came to the important things in life . Even Desdemona , whose only association with Pamela Bedford had been the series of consultations regarding the reception arrangements , knew very well how Stark 's fiance had reacted to the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and sobbed in Desdemona 's office . They had been in the middle of choosing between the asparagus tarts and miniature mushroom quiches . " A prenuptial agreement , " Pamela had wailed into a tissue . " Can you believe it ? He does n't love me , I know he does n't . Is n't that an awful thing for a bride to discover four weeks before the wedding ? What on earth am I going to do ? " " Uh , the asparagus tarts are very popular  --  " " No , do n't answer that . It 's not your . problem , is it ? I 'm sorry to burden you with this , Desdemona . It 's just that I 've got to talk to someone , and I do n't want to worry my parents . They 're so happy about this wedding . " " Are you thinking of calling it off ? " Desdemona had asked anxiously . " If so , please let me know now . I 'll be ordering ingredients and supplies and hiring extra help soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it off . " Pamela had blown her nose one last time and then wadded up the tissue . She had straightened her shoulders and given Desdemona a brave look . Joan of Arc on her way to the stake . " I 'll have to go through with the thing , of course . One does n't cancel an affair of this magnitude at the last minute , does one ? It is n't done . The family would be horrified . " " Perhaps you should go home and think about this , " Desdemona had said . " Marriage is an awfully big step . " And it 's impossible for me to return fresh asparagus and basil to my supplier . Pamela had heaved a small , tragic sigh . " He 's a nerd , you know . Or maybe an android would be a more accurate description . He 's got the brain of a computer and the body of a hunk . What a waste . " " Miss Bedford , I do n't think we should be discussing this . Your fianc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our menu decisions . " " He spent several years with a think tank in Colorado called the Rosetta Institute , you know . He specialized in applications of chaos theory . Some of his work was very hush-hush . " I see . " Desdemona did not know what she was supposed to say in response . Her definition of chaos was what happened at Right Touch when a member of her staff , many of whom were involved in the theater world , was unexpectedly called to an audition just before an important catering event . " He has absolutely no sense of style . He wears running shoes , jeans , and an old corduroy jacket to work every day . " Pamela blotted her eyes . " And little round nerdy glasses and , oh , God , a plastic pocket protector full of pens and pencils . It 's so embarrassing . " " I guess it works for him . " " I 've been doing my best to upgrade him , but it 's very difficult . You have no idea of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tux for the wedding . He wanted to rent one , can you believe it ? " " The mushroom quiches are nice , too , of course , but  --  " " He 's utterly bored by social events . " Pamela gave Desdemona a mournful look . " He detests cocktail parties and charity affairs . He never goes to the opera or the theater . He even tries to avoid routine business entertaining . " " But I think the asparagus tarts would be more visually interesting , " Desdemona said quickly . " It 's not as if I have n't tried . God knows , I 've tried . After all , I 'm the one who has to be seen in public with him . " Pamela had sniffed back more wan . " But I 'm not sure it 's possible to change him . He simply is n't interested , you see , and you have to get Stark 's full attention before you can do anything with him . " " On the other hand , we could go for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shrimp toasts , for example . " " I 'm sorry , this is n't your problem , is it ? " Pamela had said again , smiling bravely . " I have to remember that this marriage is not a life sentence . I can always get a divorce if things do n't work out . Life goes on , does n't it ? " " Right . Tomorrow is another day , " Desdemona muttered . " Let me see that menu again . Do you think we should go with the asparagus tarts or mushroom quiches ? " " The asparagus tarts , " Desdemona said swiftly . " They 're quite distinctive . A little more expensive , however . " " Cost is not a problem . As I told you , Stark will be picking up the tab for the reception . He insisted . " Pamela 's mouth had twisted bitterly for an instant . " I 'd say that he offered to cover the costs of the wedding because he felt guilty about that damned prenuptial agreement , but the truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A computer does n't have emotions , does it ? " Looking back at that awkward scene in her office , Desdemona realized she should have heeded her intuition and declined to handle the reception . Stark was not an android , and he definitely possessed emotions . She could feel them swirling about somewhere deep inside him in the same way one could feel an approaching storm long before one got drenched . In spite of her doubts , she had gone forward with the wedding plans . She was businesswoman enough to put intuition aside in favor of the practical benefits to be had from catering a major social event . The bride 's impeccable family connections and the groom 's swiftly evolving financial profile made the Stark-Bedford wedding the wedding of the season . As the caterer for the gala event Desdemona stood to reap a gold mine of publicity and contacts . Business was business , after all . But , Desdemona reminded herself , it was folly to ignore the Wainwright intuition . It was never wrong . Stark took off his round , gold-framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleated shirt . " I 'm trying to approach this problem in a logical , analytical manner , Miss Wainwright . I would appreciate your input . " Desdemona stifled a groan . " Perhaps the prenuptial agreement struck Miss Bedford as a little , shall we say , unromantic ? " That was putting it mildly . It did n't take a clairvoyant to realize that Pamela , blond , beautiful , and the apple of her parents ' eyes , had grown up in a privileged world . It was a world that had always given her everything she desired . She had been crushed to learn that the man she was to marry had no intention of giving her his unqualified love and trust . As the date of the wedding had neared , Pamela had grown increasingly tense . Desdemona had seen the mounting anxiety in her client each time they had met to go over the reception arrangements , but she had optimistically chosen to ignore it . The future happiness of the bride and groom was not her problem . Desdemona had told herself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful reception , and that would be the end of her concern with the Stark-Bedford marriage . Unfortunately , she had miscalculated . Pamela had panicked at the last minute , leaving not only Stark , but Right Touch , in the lurch . " Unromantic ? Unromantic ? " Stark put on his glasses and swung around to confront Desdemona . His riveting green eyes glittered with an unsettling intensity . " What the hell kind of answer is that ? " " Well , I 'm not sure , " Desdemona admitted weakly . " Probably because it 's a useless , meaningless , illogical answer . " Stark shrugged out of the black tux jacket and tossed it aside with a gesture of chilling disgust . The movement made Desdemona grip the arms of her chair very tightly . The fact that Stark appeared to have his emotions under an ironclad self-control only served to make them seem all the more dangerous . She was rapidly learning that Stark did not show his feelings the way the men in her family did . Wainwright men were volatile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that matter . Wainwrights were theater people , after all . They relished emotion . But Stark was a different breed . His emotional depths were dark and murky . He was difficult to read . For some inexplicable reason , she found him fascinating . She sensed that he was her exact opposite in many ways , and yet there was something oddly compelling about him . Part of her was drawn to him . She wondered rather wistfully what might have happened had they met in another place and another time . She had become aware of him as a person only an hour ago when it had finally dawned on everyone that he had been abandoned at the altar . Until that point she had been too frenetically busy behind the scenes to pay any attention to the groom . She had not even caught sight of him until his best man , Dane McCallum , had made the dreadful announcement that had sent the guests home . She could say one thing for certain about Stark , Desdemona decided . The man did look good in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knight . Not overly tall , a shade under six feet , perhaps , but very hard and very solid . He was sleekly muscled , with no sign of flab anywhere . He moved the way that a well-trained actor did , with grace and an instinctive sense of presence . When Stark entered a room , you would know he was there . Desdemona sensed that it was all unconscious on his part , however , not a carefully honed tactic to gain attention . He seemed completely unaware of the intensity that he projected . He simply was what he was , a self-contained force of nature . The tails of his black bow tie hung down the front of his crisply pleated shirt . He had undone the tie a few minutes ago when he had stalked into his study . Now , as Desdemona watched apprehensively , he yanked open the collar of his shirt , exposing the strong column of his throat . She stared in mute amazement as he impatiently ripped off his gold cuff links and tossed them onto the glass-topped desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stark rolled up his sleeves , revealing sinewy forearms and a large , stainless steel digital watch that was adorned with a lot of miniature keys . It was the sort of watch that looked as though it could provide weather information , stock market reports , and breaking headlines in addition to the time of day . It was a high-tech gadget-lover 's watch . From what Desdemona had seen , everything in the fortress was a high-tech-lover 's dream . Lights came on automatically when you walked into a room . The kitchen was state-of-the-art . A household computer regulated everything , from the inside air temperature and the blinds that opened and closed according to the angle of the sun , to the extremely sophisticated security system . Even the art on the walls looked as though it had been generated by a computer . The pictures were brilliant explosions of light and color formed into complex , surreal designs . Desdemona struggled to change the subject . " A prenuptial agreement does seem to make a business deal out of a marriage , does n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be glad to know that the champagne can be returned to the supplier . I 've deducted the amount from the total , as you can see . " " What 's wrong with treating marriage as a business deal ? We 're talking about a major financial commitment here , not some short-term affair . It 's an investment , and it should be handled like one . Desdemona wished she had kept her mouth shut . It was obvious that Stark had been looking for a target , and she had made the mistake of providing him with one . She hastily tried to backpedal . " Right . A serious business , " Desdemona said . " Damn right . I thought Pamela understood that . " Stark paced back to his desk and threw himself down into his chair . Amazingly enough , the chair did not so much as squeak beneath his not inconsiderable weight . Stark did not glance at the invoice . " I thought I 'd made a good choice this time . She seemed so stable . So sensible . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man crazy with one scene of psychodrama after another . " Desdemona arched a brow . " I do n't know about that . I 'd say Miss Bedford has a nice touch when it comes to dramatic scenes . Abandoning a man at the altar is definitely a colorful way to stage an exit . " Stark ignored the comment . " Her father and I got along well . Stark Security Systems did a job for his company last fall . That was how I met Pamela . " " I see . " Desdemona knew that Stark 's extremely successful computer security consulting firm was rapidly becoming the premier company of its type in the region . Stark Security Systems advised many of the largest Northwest businesses on matters ranging from computer security issues to corporate espionage . Word had it that Stark , who had started with nothing three years ago , was now , at the age of thirty-four , as wealthy as many of his clients . " I had every reason to assume that Pamela was n't a silly , starry-eyed romantic . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational . " Stark drained the last of the brandy in a single swallow . His green eyes narrowed dangerously . " I 'm beginning to believe that I was deliberately misled . " " I 'm sure it was all a terrible misunderstanding . " " No , she misled me , all right . Made me think she was a reasonable , levelheaded female . She never said a word when we discussed the prenuptial agreement in my lawyer 's office . " " Maybe it took her a while to get over the shock . " " What shock ? " Stark glowered . " She knew all along that I planned to have a contract . Only reasonable thing to do under the circumstances . " " Sure . Right , Only reasonable thing . " Desdemona eyed the empty glass that was positioned near Stark 's big hand . Perhaps a little more brandy would get him past the surly stage . " You 're a businesswoman , Miss Wainwright . You understand why I wanted a prenuptial agreement , do n't you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of prenuptial agreements a lot of thought . " " Never been married ? " " No . Now , I 'll be able to donate some of the food to a homeless shelter , and my staff will eat some of the rest , but  --  " " Neither have I. I did n't think I was asking for too much . " Desdemona got to her feet , seized the brandy bottle sitting on the corner of the desk , and leaned over to refill Stark 's glass . " Thanks , " he muttered . " You 're welcome . " Desdemona moved a pen a smidgen closer to his hand before she sat down . " I suppose prenuptial agreements do make sense . Sort of like having a catering contract for a wedding reception . " " Exactly . " He looked morosely pleased by her perceptive response . " A business contract . " " Speaking of business contracts , Mr. Stark  --  " " Logical , reasonable things , contracts . Lord knows , wedding vows do n't amount to much these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something you can hold in your hand . " Stark made a broad fist . " Something you can see . A business agreement has substance . It has teeth . A business agreement is binding . " " It certainly is . You 'll notice that the business agreement in front of you was signed and dated by Miss Bedford , who made it very clear that you were going to cover the expenses for the reception . Stark looked at her , really looked at her , for the first time . " What the hell are you talking about ? " " The expenses for the reception , Mr. Stark . The total is there at the bottom of the invoice . If you would just take a moment to make out the check , I 'll be on my way . I 'm sure you 'd rather be alone at this unhappy time . " Stark scowled at the invoice . " What is this ? Six thousand dollars ? For a wedding reception that got canceled ? " " You only owe six thousand because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the contract was signed and the second payment which was made last month when the supplies were ordered . " " I do n't remember giving you two previous payments . " " Miss Bedford said you gave instructions for her to collect whatever she needed from your accounting department . Someone at Stark Security Systems cut the first two checks . I 've already cashed them . " " Damn . Things are out of control here . Give me one good reason why I should pay you another six grand . " It was clear to Desdemona that she finally had his full attention . The light of battle glinted in his eyes . It did not bode well . " Because I 've got a business contract that says you owe me another six thousand dollars , " she said bluntly . " Look , Mr. Stark , I 'm sincerely sorry about what happened this afternoon . I know what a traumatic event this must have been for you . " " Do you ? " " I can certainly imagine how upsetting it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get used to it . " She stared at him . " I beg your pardon ? " " I said you get used to it . " Stark pulled the invoice closer and studied it with a gimlet gaze . " Second time it 's happened to me . I 'm a pro at being left at the altar . " Desdemona was horrified . " You 've been through this before ? " " Two years ago . Her name was Lindsay Mills . Married a doctor instead . " " Good grief , " Desdemona said faintly . " I had n't realized . " " It 's not something I bring up a lot in the course of casual conversation . " " I can understand that . " " She left a note , too . It said that I was emotionally frozen and obsessively fixated on the subject of trust and loyalty . " Stark 's teeth appeared briefly in a humorless smile . " She had a degree in psychology . " Desdemona shivered . Stark 's eyes were colder than the walk-in freezer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign a prenuptial agreement , too ? " " Of course . She agreed to sign it on our wedding day . But she failed to show up at the altar . Sent a damned note instead . Said she had to marry for love . " " I see . " " A mutual acquaintance told me that she filed for divorce from the doctor six months ago . " " I see . " Apparently she fell for a tennis pro . " " It happens . " " So much for a marriage based on love , " Stark said with grim satisfaction . " I do n't think one should generalize , " Desdemona said cautiously . " The way I figure it , I got lucky , " Stark said . " Perhaps . " At least I did n't get stuck with the tab for the reception that time . " Stark picked up a pen and started going item by item down the invoice . Desdemona breathed a small sigh of relief . He was at last examining the bill . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . Privately she thought she understood exactly why Pamela Bedford and Lindsay Mills had lost their nerve on the eve of marriage . It would take courage to marry Sam Stark . His name suited him all too well . There was a hard , elemental quality about him that would give any intelligent woman pause . The medieval knight image applied to his features as well as his build . His hair was nearly black , overlong , and brushed straight back from his high forehead . The broad , flat planes of his face and jaw looked as though they had been fashioned to wear a steel helm . His brilliant green eyes glowed with the power of very old gemstones . A prowling , predatory intelligence burned in those eyes . All in all , there was a stem , unyielding , utterly relentless quality about Sam Stark . It was the sort of quality one might have valued in a knight a few hundred years earlier but that was unexpected and deeply disturbing in a modern-day male . Desdemona told herself that she was profoundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check from him , Stark would cease to be her problem . On the other hand , she had never met anyone who had been abandoned at the altar , let alone abandoned twice . " Two pounds of tapenade ? " Stark glared at Desdemona . " What the hell is tapenade ? " " Basically it 's an olive paste . You , spread it on crackers . " " It costs a fortune . Would n't it have been cheaper to just serve a couple of bowls of olives ? " " Probably , but Miss Bedford wanted tapenade . " " And what about these cheese breadsticks ? Who needs four hundred breadsticks ? " " Two hundred people were invited to the reception , Mr. Stark . Miss Bedford wanted to be able to serve two breadsticks apiece . " Stark continued down the list . " Stuffed mushroom caps ? I do n't even like stuffed mushroom caps . " " Apparently Miss Bedford was fond of them . " " More fond of them than she was of me , obviously . What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days . " " They are n't real swans . They 're ice sculptures . Rafael , one of my employees , did a beautiful job on them . " Stark glanced toward the window . " I 'm paying fifty bucks apiece for those blocks of ice that are melting away in my garden ? " " Think of them as works of art , Mr. Stark . Rafael definitely considers himself an artist . " " They 're made out of ice . I 'm paying a total of one hundred and fifty dollars to water my garden with fancy ice sculptures ? " " I realize this is very difficult for you , Mr. Stark . I 'll be glad to go over each item on the bill , but I can assure you that all the charges are quite reasonable . " " Your idea of reasonable and mine are two different things , Miss Wainwright . " Stark went back to the invoice . " About this herbed goat cheese . " " Very popular these days . " " I do n't see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's very special goat cheese . Made by a local firm . " " What do they do ? Raise the goats in their own private , waterfront condominiums ? " Desdemona opened her mouth to respond with a crack about the goats being worth it , but at the last instant she changed her mind . It dawned on her that Stark was using the line-by-line argument over the invoice as a means of venting some of the rage and pain he must surely be feeling . She glanced at his very large fist , which was fiercely clamped around a slender gold pen . The muscles in his forearm were bunched and taut . " I know the goat cheese is a little steep , " she said gently . " But it 's excellent , and it keeps well . Shall I leave it behind for you to eat ? " " Do that . I 'll have it for dinner tonight . Leave some crackers and a couple of bottles of the champagne , too . " Desdemona frowned . " Look , I know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be all right here on your own this evening ? " He glanced up swiftly , his gaze shuttered . " Do n't worry , I 'm not going to do something stupid like overdose on goat cheese and champagne . " " You 've been through an emotionally exhausting experience . It 's not always a good idea to be alone after that kind of thing . Do you have someone who can stay with you ? A family member , perhaps ? " " I do n't have any family here in Seattle . " Desdemona was startled . " None of them came out for the wedding ? " " I 'm not close to my family , Miss Wainwright . " " Oh . " She was unsure how to respond to that . The concept of being bereft of family sent a chill through her . Since she had become a member of the extended Wainwright clan at the age of five , family had been everything to Desdemona . The time before her mother had married Benedick Wainwright was a shadowed realm that Desdemona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend you could call ? " " I suppose I could send out for one of those inflatable , life-sized , anatomically correct dolls that are sold in adult entertainment stores , " Stark said . " But with my luck , she 'd probably deflate before I figured out the operating instructions . " Desdemona . smiled faintly . " I 'm glad your sense of humor is still intact . It 's a good sign . " " Do you think so ? " " Definitely . " Desdemona leaned forward and folded her arms on the desk . " Look , I 'm serious here . I really do n't think you ought to be alone tonight . " He gazed at her with unreadable eyes . " What would you suggest I do ? I 'm not exactly in the mood to throw a party . " Desdemona gave into impulse . " Tell you what . Let 's finish going over this invoice . Then you can come back to the Right Touch kitchen with me and have dinner with my staff . Afterward you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theater ? " " The Limelight down in Pioneer Square . It 's a little fringe playhouse located underneath the viaduct . Know it ? " " No . I rarely go to the theater . " Desdemona had learned early in life that the world was divided into two groups , those who loved the theater and barbarians . She seldom socialized with the latter , but today for some reason she was inspired to make an exception . " The Limelight is very small , " Desdemona said . " It does a lot of experimental contemporary stuff . My cousin Juliet has a part in the current production . " Stark looked dubious . " Is it going to be one of those weird plays where there 's no plot or scenery and the actors come on stage naked and throw things at the audience ? " Desdemona smiled blandly . " I see you 're familiar with experimental theater . " " I 've heard about stuff like that . I do n't think it 's the kind of thing I 'd enjoy . " " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to spend his wedding night alone , I would think that a live actress running around in the buff on stage would be a lot more interesting than an inflatable , anatomically correct doll . " Stark gave her a thoughtful look . " Point taken . "
