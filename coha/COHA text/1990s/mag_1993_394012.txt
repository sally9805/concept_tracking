One month  --  more exactly , 32 days this past summer  --  is the longest time I 've gone in my life without Mass , without the Eucharist , the bread of life . I had been constantly on the road in what was once called Greater Syria , in the very landscape , indeed a few hours across the Jordan from the hillside where Jesus fed 5,000 who had followed Him into the wilderness . Where , without His bread , they would " perish along the way . " The previous week at the Gulf of Aqaba we had looked across to the Sinai . In my missal , that day 's Old Testament reading was from Exodus 16 , where the Israelites grumbled against Moses for leading them , now breadless , into the desert to the northwest of where we then stood , and the Lord fed them with manna from heaven  --  scriptural assurance that as long as we acknowledge our hunger God will not let us starve . Many priests in religious communities ( those without parish assignments ) rise early , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a private Mass every day . Others  --  and I think this includes most ordained around my time and after ( 1967 )  --  read the breviary only occasionally , squeeze in private prayer in holes of silence during the day or in the midst of other activities like reading , driving or exercise and concelebrate Mass in small groups or simply attend Mass three or four times a week with a university or high school community . And I suppose there are others , young and old , either dedicated men gobbled up in work or birds with broken wings , who do much less . They may notice their hunger , or they may not . When I accepted the invitation to spend a month on a tightly controlled schedule of faculty study and travel in the Middle East , I sensed that it might cut me off for the first time from the structures  --  flimsy though they often are  --  that sustained my spiritual life : community liturgy , privacy and , above all , the regular presence of fellow believers . In other summers I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , traveling alone , I had either found a church to pop into for Mass or a religious community where I could pause and pray . But the goal of our trip 's sponsor , the Washington-based National Council on United States-Arab Relations , was to increase our understanding of the Arab world , i.e. , to offset the influence of Israeli propaganda in the United States by getting us to say good things about Syria and Jordan when we got home . Thus , our Sunday schedules took us to mosques , Roman ruins , the Euphrates Dam at Lake Assad , more Roman ruins and a Palestinian refugee camp . Jesuit spirituality is , of course , to " find God in all things , " and I was ready to find God in all these places , but finding Him that way usually presumes a supportive structure of liturgical prayer . At a small-group Jesuit community liturgy before I left , I prayed aloud for some formula to see me through and hoped that by increasing my charity , my sensitivity to the group , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Him present in Mass . But the words almost stuck in my throat . I knew well  --  as did my fellow Jesuits  --  that my personality had too many hard edges  --  I was too direct , sometimes confrontational  --  to become a tour group 's angel of warmth and peace . Somehow the answer would have to emerge from events , from the group , from what we saw and read and heard , from my fellow travelers ' real needs rather than my needs or rules . I would have to trust that as long as the desire to pray remained , the spark of prayer was already there ; that sometimes that would have to be enough and that at other times God 's glory would reveal itself in mosques , stones and faces on the street or on the bus . The bus , in time , was to help define the problem  --  and the solution . We were , to our surprise and initial alarm , not a group of 10 scholarly peers shuttled from high level conferences with sheiks , ambassadors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fellows ( us ) and the Kerr Scholars , 11 " genius " high school students  --  future ambassadors no doubt , but still " kids " we thought we had left at home , and 11 more minds and bodies competing for the good seats at the too-small conference table and for the prime minister 's attention . By the time we got used to one another and had even become friends , for the last week the bus shook again with the influx of 15 high school teachers from the Midwest with Fulbrights , swelling our ranks to 45-plus , depending on how many handlers , guides and friends came along . We were predominantly white Protestants , mostly Baptists , one of whom , an Air Force captain , was ordained . Of the rest , one woman was Jewish , one of the faculty ( a former priest ) and three students were Catholic , and the others , except for one once-upon-a-time Catholic , were completely indifferent to religion . For about a week I toyed with , but eventually ruled out , the catacombs solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread from the hotel and " saying Mass " alone or with one or two others in my room . As it turned out , I would go through the day 's readings alone before breakfast and try to apply them to the day 's events . Marvelously , the Old Testament stories were from Genesis and Exodus : God promises all this land to Abraham and his descendants , who now occupy the West Bank homes and farms of the 100,000 Palestinians we saw scurrying through the dirt streets of the Baqaa refugee camp a week before ; Joseph 's sojourn in Egypt ; Moses parting the Red Sea , not very far from Aqaba , a once-thriving port that normally fed the Jordanian economy by servicing over 50 ships in any one day . Because Jordan is Iraq 's lifeline to the West , Aqaba now lies virtually dead , cut off by U.N . sanctions against Iraq . In the first week , we visited the Syrian ghost town of Quneitra on the Golan Heights , which in 1973 , in peacetime , the Israelis systematically destroyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its inhabitants . Our leader asked me to say a prayer . In the shell of a gutted Christian church , I prayed that the God of Abraham would forgive those who had leveled this town and forgive us our silence in the face of any injustice . As our second Sunday approached , which was also the Fourth of July , my Baptist minister friend and I planned an ecumenical service  --  a 20-minute pause in the ruins of the Byzantine basilica of St. Sergius in the old walled city of Rasafah . There we prayed that the United States might be freed from the arrogance that destroyed other civilizations . When we returned from the refugee camp , shattered by the desperation of the children who had swarmed around us in the streets , eight of us met and prayed for the " sheep without a shepherd . " Frankly , a standard Catholic response to each of those situations might have been a Mass ; but , in these instances , it did not fit . It would have been , a friend suggested later , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula that would have highlighted the " power " of one member of a group , some of whom had never met a priest before and were perhaps already bewildered by the full-time presence of a Jesuit in their midst . Furthermore , in 26 years I had said a private Mass only a few times a year , usually during my annual retreat . The solitary or two-person hotel room Eucharist did n't seem right . My evangelical Protestant friend told me later that he had been ready for a Mass if I had chosen to say it , but he was much more moved  --  and surprised  --  by my participation in spontaneous prayer . Islam helped , but only a little . It helped to see Islam as it sees itself , in continuity with Christianity  --  demonstrated by the huge shrine built around the head of St. John the Baptist in Damascus ' great Omayyed Mosque . There , in the seventh century , Christians and Muslims shared worship space for almost 70 years . And the sight of Muslim men  --  a young boy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university  --  bowing , then kneeling at the midday call to prayer , sometimes jolted me . Why did not I , as they did , just stop everything , kneel down and pray ? Because it 's not my style . So too , church-hunting  --  or church touring  --  helped , but only up to a point . Our bus deposited us at one church ( usually Greek Orthodox ) after another , and occasionally I could snatch a moment of meditation in what I recall now as a long blur of icons , ruins , tombs and two dozen fellow travelers wandering curious , puzzled , bored , harried among the pillars . One night , exploring the famous Damascus street called Straight , where St. Paul 's blindness was cured ( Acts 10 ) , three of us stumbled into a party in the courtyard of a Syrian Catholic church . " We have a new father , " a welcoming young man explained , and we understood that the parish was celebrating the birth of a son . When the " father " showed up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . But it turned out to be an ordination party with all the exuberance and joy of a wedding reception , lots of clapping and singing and cheerful young men in black . Another day the former priest and I discovered an urban Italian Franciscan church , but its familiar decor  --  painted plaster statues night out of the Bronx  --  jarred us and we hurried away . The day we arrived in Damascus , President Clinton bombed Baghdad to punish Saddam Hussein for his alleged conspiracy to assassinate President Bush . Our American professor-handler , perhaps in an attempt to calm the nerves of the high school students , announced the raid , which killed eight civilians , in cold-blooded political-science terms as something nations do to one another when they 're trying to make a point . I felt sick  --  partly because Bill Clinton , in my judgment , had revealed himself to be no more morally sensitive to human life than George Bush ; partly because as a priest I could not for long keep my mouth shut about the moral issues involved . Throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wailing over the death of her four-year-old son : she holds his picture to the camera and says , " Look what you 've done . " Thirty years before , in the seminary , many of us had read Pierre Teilhard de Chardin 's " The Mass on the World , " where , alone in the desert in 1923 , without bread , wine or altar , Teilhard makes the whole earth his altar and offers up the " labors and sufferings of the world . " " One by one , Lord , " he prays , " I see and love all those whom you have given me to sustain and charm my life . " And many of us had chosen to print on our ordination cards a quotation from his " The Priest , " in Writings in Times of War : " As far as my strength will allow me , because I am a priest , I would henceforth be the first to become aware of what the world loves , pursues , suffers . " I can not report that my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , but God did begin to show Himself daily in those He had " given me to sustain and charm my life " on this trip . I discussed the bombing with the students . To some , it was " politics , " " realism " ; to others , it was wrong . As our old bus rumbled across the desert a lot of the usual questions came up : celibacy , women priests , birth control , abortion , gays in the military and premarital sex . But one of the unusual questions too : Where was the Catholic Church during the Holocaust ? It was another way of asking , I think , Where is religion  --  those who say they believe in God  --  in the face of human suffering ? The human suffering in front of us was Arab : the refugees from Quneitra and also the town of Hama , where in 1982 President Assad massacred at least 10,000 of his own people to crush a Muslim Brotherhood revolt . And the Palestinian refugee camp at Baqaa , outside Amman  --  over 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desperate teen-age boy followed me for blocks to ask if he could come to America and get a job . Somehow he actually believed that I could help him . Now I am home . I have been to Mass in the Georgetown chapel . I came to Communion , not with a swelling of emotion , but with the sense that I was having dinner with an old friend . But I ' ' 11 never say Mass again without seeing that boy . Raymond A. Schroth , S.J. , a journalism professor at Loyola University in New Orleans , is on sabbatical at Georgetown University this year . <p>
