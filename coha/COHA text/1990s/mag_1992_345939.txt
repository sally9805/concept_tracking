CONVERSATIONS WITH MY FATHER by Herb Gardner <P> Eddie Ross ( Judd Hirsch ) is a Manhattan Tevye circa 1936 , railing at family , customers and God . The fury is understandable . Both sons are targets of anti- Semitic gangs . Racketeers want a piece of his saloon business . Worse still , Zaretsky ( David Margulies ) , an aging star of the Yiddish theater , keeps informing him of the Holocaust engulfing Europe . <P> In Herb Gardner 's memory play , Conversations with My Father , Eddie takes on the opposition over the course of 40 years . The thugs back off when he threatens them ; they sense that this " crazy Hebe " would just as soon die as give them a dime . History is not so easily intimidated . When World War II begins , his adolescent son Joey ( Tony Gillan ) , inflamed by news of the death camps , enlists in the Navy with tragic results . The surviving son , Charlie ( Tony Shalhoub ) , becomes a prosperous novelist but fails at everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is a reproach : the " dying man with a dead language and no place to go " becomes a millionaire and survives to age 93 . Eddie , ever the loser , is incapacitated by a stroke . <P> Through Gardner 's witty alter ego , Shalhoub , the playwright evokes a more innocent  --  and more malignant  --  era , flavoring the immigrant struggle with the sour salt of Jewish proverbs : " Sleep faster , we need the pillow . " Eddie sometimes goes on so long the play could be retitled Monologues with My Children . But there is not a weak spot in the large cast , sensitively directed by Daniel Sullivan . Margulies is a geriatric standout , and Hirsch gives the most uncompromising and indelible performance of his career . Producers are always searching for actor-proof roles . Here is something rarer : role-proof actors .
