Chapter One&lt; It took all of the considerable self-control Eugenia Swift had at her disposal to hang on to her temper . " For heaven 's sake , Tabitha , the last thing I need is a bodyguard . " Tabitha Leabrook smiled with the sort of poised confidence reserved for those who have grown up with money , social influence , and very high self-esteem . " Think of him as a precaution , Eugenia , " she said . " A prudent preventative action . Rather like wearing a seat belt . " " Or getting a flu shot , " Cyrus Chandler Colfax offered helpfully . Eugenia tightened her fingers in a reflexive movement . The fresh-off-the-press invitation to the Leabrook Glass Museum 's annual Foundation Reception crumpled in her hand . She wondered what the penalty was for strangling very large men who wore tacky aloha shirts , khaki chinos , and moccasin-style loafers . Surely no judge or jury would convict her , she thought . Not when they saw the evidence . Colfax had said very little thus far , obviously content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the room . He was biding his time , letting Tabitha wear her down . She sensed his plan as clearly as if he had written it out for her to read . He intended to loom in the shadows until she had been sufficiently softened up . Then he would step in to deliver the coup de grce . Dressed in the splashy blue , green , and orange shirt , he should have looked ridiculous against the oriental carpet and warmly paneled walls of her expensively furnished office . Unfortunately , he did not appear even slightly out of place . He clashed terribly with the expensive decor , of course , but he did not look out of place . It was the room that looked somehow prissy and too elegant . Eugenia was not fooled by the beachcomber ensemble . Not for one minute . She had a talent for being able to look beneath the surface . It was a gift that had led her into a successful career , first as an assistant curator at the Leabrook and now as its director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a problem . The cryptic tropical attire could not conceal the reality of Cyrus Colfax . He looked as if he had just ridden in off the range with a pair of six-guns strapped to his hip and was prepared to clean up the town . Slow-moving and slow-talking , he had the feral , ascetic features of an avenging lawman of the mythic West . He even had the hands of a gunman , she thought . Or at least , the sort of hands she imagined a gunslinger would have . Strong and lean , they were a highly uncivilized combination of sensitivity and ruthlessness . There was an aura of great stillness about him . He made no extraneous movements . He did not drum his fingers . He did not fiddle with a pen . He simply occupied space . No , Eugenia thought , he controlled space . She estimated his age at about thirty-five , but it was difficult to be certain . He had the kind of features that only toughened with the years . There was a hint of silver in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing of time . There was certainly no evidence of any softening around the middle , she noticed . But what disturbed her the most were his eyes . They were the color of thick , heavy glass viewed from the side , an intense , compelling green that was cold , brilliant , and mysterious . It was a color that was unique to a material forged in fire . Eugenia tossed aside the crushed invitation and folded her hands together on top of her polished cherrywood desk . This was her office and she was in charge . She glared at Tabitha . " What you are suggesting is highly inefficient and a complete waste of time , " she said . " Besides , I 'm supposed to be on vacation . " " A working vacation , " Tabitha reminded her . " She knew she was losing the battle , but it was her nature to fight on , even when defeat loomed . It was true that she was the director of the museum , but Tabitha Leabrook was the chief administrator of the Leabrook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills . When push came to shove , Tabitha had the final say . Ninety-nine percent of the time the chain of command created no major problems for Eugenia . She had a great deal of respect for Tabitha , a small , dainty woman in her early seventies . Tabitha had a seemingly unlimited reservoir of public-spirited energy , refined tastes , and a good heart . She had a penchant for facelifts and the money to afford them . She also had a will of iron . For the most part Tabitha demonstrated a gratifying respect for Eugenia 's abilities and intelligence . Since appointing her director of the Leabrook , she had given Eugenia her head when it came to the administration of the museum . Tabitha and the Board of Directors of the Leabrook Foundation had been delighted with Eugenia 's achievements . Under her direction , the Leabrook had swiftly shed its stodgy image and achieved a reputation for an outstanding and exciting collection of ancient and modern glass . It was unlike Tabitha to interfere in Eugenia 's decision making . The fact that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I will feel much more comfortable if Mr. Colfax accompanies you to Frog Cove Island , " Tabitha said . " After all , if there is some question of murder here  --  " " For the last time , " Eugenia interrupted , " there is no question of murder . The authorities declared Adam Daventry 's death an accident . He fell down a flight of stairs and broke his neck . " " The lawyer who is handling the Daventry estate called me an hour ago , " Tabitha said . " He told me that the executors insist that Mr. Colfax make some inquiries into the matter . " " So let him make inquiries . " Eugenia spread her hands . " Why do I have to be involved in them ? " Colfax stirred at the edge of the beam of light cast by the Tiffany lamp on the desk . " The estate wants everything handled very quietly . Very discreetly  --  " Eugenia eyed his bright , palm-tree-patterned aloha shirt . " No offense , but somehow I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colfax . " He smiled his slow , enigmatic smile . " I have many hidden qualities . " " They are extremely well concealed , " she agreed politely . " It will be an undercover operation . " Tabitha 's eyes gleamed with enthusiasm . " Rather exciting , do n't you think , Eugenia ? " " I think , " Eugenia said carefully , " that it sounds like a lot of nonsense . I read the articles in the Seattle Times and the Post-Intelligencer . There was no mention of any suspicion of foul play in Daventry 's death . " Tabitha peered at her over the ruins of her reading glasses . " I must remind you , Eugenia , that the sooner the executors are satisfied , the sooner the Leabrook will be able to move the Daventry glass collection here to the museum . " Tabitha was right , and Eugenia knew it . Adam Daventry had left his magnificent collection of glass to the Leabrook . For most of his time as a collector he had focused on seventeenth- to twentieth-century glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also begun to acquire some ancient glass . Eugenia was eager to get her hands on the collection , but that was not the real reason she planned to spend her summer vacation on Frog Cove Island . Adam Daventry 's death had made the Seattle papers for two reasons , The first was that he was the last direct descendent of the Golden Daventrys , a prominent Northwest family that had made its early fortunes in timber and then moved on to amass even more cash in Pacific Rim shipping . The second reason Daventry 's death had garnered a mention was that five years earlier Adam Daventry had moved to Frog Cove Island off the Washington coast and established an art colony . The island had become a popular summer weekend destination for Seattlites , tourists , and others who liked to browse the local galleries . The annual Daventry Workshops Festival , held in June , had become a major summer event that drew large crowds . Although Daventry had plastered his name on the art colony and the summer festival , he himself had always avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken of him showed an elegantly lean , dark-haired , middle-aged man with smoldering eyes and Faustian features . Eugenia had met him six months earlier when he had come to Seattle to consult with her in her professional capacity . She had quickly discovered that she had something in common with Daventry , namely an abiding passion for glass . But in spite of that , she had come away from the encounter with a one-word description of him . The word was bloodsucker . " I do n't understand why you 're so upset about this arrangement , Eugenia , " Tabitha said . " It 's not as if you both wo n't have plenty of privacy . From what the lawyer said , Glass House is quite large . Three stories and a basement . There are any number of bathrooms and bedrooms , apparently . So many , in fact , that the executors plan to sell it off to a hotel firm to be converted into an inn . " " Yes , I know , but  --  " " The only thing you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tabitha concluded . " Do n't worry , " Cyrus said . " I 'll bring my own food and do my own cooking , Ms. Swift . " Eugenia chose to ignore that . She pitched her voice to a soothing tone , the sort she used when she urged possessive private collectors to donate their finest pieces to the Leabrook . " No one 's going to stop you if you want to go to Frog Cove Island , Mr. Colfax . But I fail to see why you should stay at Glass House with me , even if it is big enough to be an inn . " " Because I need open , unquestioned access to the place , Ms. Swift . Among other things , I want to go through Daventry 's papers and files . It 's going to take time to do a thorough investigation . The easiest way to handle it is for me to stay at the house . " Eugenia drummed her fingers on the desk . " I suppose that the estate has every right to hire an investigator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Colfax . But I fail to see why you have to attach yourself to me . " " It 's a perfectly logical move , " Tabitha insisted . Eugenia clenched her fingers around the pen . Tabitha was a great fan of murder mysteries . She was obviously thrilled by the prospect of aiding and abetting a real-life private detective . " I 've got a job to do on Frog Cove Island , " Eugenia said steadily . " I 'm going to inventory Daventry 's collection . Make arrangements to have it all crated and shipped back to Seattle . I do n't have time to play Nancy Drew . " " You do n't have to assist in the investigation , " Tabitha assured her . " That 's Mr. Colfax 's job . But he needs a cover in order to do his work . " " Why on earth ca n't he just be up-front about what he 's doing ? " Eugenia retorted . " Why ca n't he tell people he 's looking into Daventry 's death ? " " I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cyrus said . " Besides , the island community is a small one and very insular . It 's not likely that any of the locals would talk freely to a private investigator if they knew who he was and what he was doing . " " I 'm sure Mr. Colfax wo n't get in your way , " Tabitha said with an encouraging smile . Eugenia eyed Cyrus with brooding dismay . He most definitely would get in her way . She could tell that much just by looking at him . One could not simply ignore a man like this . The shirt alone made it impossible . In the normal course of events , his presence would not have constituted a serious problem for her . An irritation , perhaps , but not a major problem . As Tabitha had pointed out , Glass House was reputed to be quite large . But the business she intended to pursue on Daventry Island did not come under the heading of normal . She had her own agenda at Glass House , and that agenda had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Adam Daventry had fallen to his death , his lover , Nellie Grant , had drowned in a boating accident . Her body had never been recovered . The official verdict was that she had been washed overboard into the icy waters of Puget Sound . There had been some speculation that , despondent over her lover 's death , she had committed suicide . Eugenia did not believe that Nellie had taken her own life , and she knew her friend had been experienced with small boats . The problem was that she could not come up with any other logical explanations for Nellie 's death at sea . She only knew she would not be able to sleep well until she got some answers . She was , after all , the one who had introduced Nellie to Adam Daventry . Any way she looked at it , Eugenia knew that if Nellie had never met Daventry and gone to Frog Cove Island , she would probably still be alive . " Mr. Colfax can go to the island as a tourist , " she suggested in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can browse through the art galleries or hang out in the local taverns . Is n't that the way a real professional investigator would go about worming information out of people ? " Colfax did not even wince at the thinly veiled insult , she noticed . But Tabitha 's surgically tight jaw became even tighter . " Mr. Colfax is a very real professional investigator , " she said . " He has his own firm , Colfax Security , with two offices on the West Coast , including one in Portland . " " We 're planning to expand to Seattle this year , " Cyrus said easily . " Is that so ? " Eugenia narrowed her eyes . " Tell me , why does the Daventry estate suspect foul play in Adam Daventry 's death ? " " It 's not a matter of suspicion , " Cyrus said . " It 's more a case of what the executors feel was an inadequate investigation by the local authorities . They just want a second opinion , that 's all . And they want it done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been ? " Eugenia demanded . " Have n't got a clue , " Cyrus said . Eugenia made herself count to ten . " I hesitate to ask , but do you perhaps have any suspects ? " " Nope . " She sighed . " You 've asked the Leabrook to provide cover for you , Mr. Colfax . Just exactly how do you expect us to do that ? What sort of excuse am I supposed to use in order to explain why I 'm spending my summer vacation with you at Glass House ? " Tabitha spoke up before he could respond . " I thought we could send him along as your assistant . " " My assistant ? " Eugenia swung around in her chair . " Trust me , Tabitha , no one is going to believe for one moment that Mr. Colfax is an assistant curator or anything else involved in the museum business . " Cyrus glanced down at the palm trees on his chest . " Is it the shirt ? " She refused to acknowledge the question . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not going to work . Surely you can see that . " Tabitha pursed her lips in thought . " He does have a certain eccentric style , does n't he ? Perhaps we could pass him off as a photographer hired to take pictures of the Daventry glass collection . Photographers are inclined toward eccentricity . " " I have never , " Eugenia said between her teeth , " met one who looked this eccentric . " " A photographer cover is too complicated , anyway , " Cyrus said . " I 'd have to bring along a lot of fancy equipment that I would n't have time to figure out . Furthermore , there 's always the risk that a real photographer on the island might want to talk shop . In which case I 'd probably give myself away in the first five minutes . I 'm not real good with gadgets . " " Good grief . " Eugenia closed her eyes . " It 's hopeless . " " Cheer up , " Cyrus said . " I have an idea that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eugenia cautiously opened her eyes . " What is it ? " " We can go to the island as a couple . " She gazed at him , uncomprehending . " A couple of what ? " " Of course . " Tabitha bubbled over with excitement . " A couple . That 's a wonderful idea , Mr. Colfax . " He gave her a modest smile . " Thanks . I think it has possibilities . " Eugenia froze . " Wait a second . Are you talking about you and me ? Together ? As a couple ? " " Why not ? " He gave her what was no doubt intended to pass for an innocent , earnest expression . " It 's the perfect excuse for us to spend some time alone together at Glass House . " " Oh , you wo n't be entirely alone , " Tabitha said helpfully . " There 's a sort of caretaker-butler on site . The lawyer said his name is Leonard Hastings . He used to work for Daventry . The estate kept him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eugenia knew the name . The box she had received that contained Nellie Grant 's clothes and personal effects had been sent back to Seattle by someone named Leonard Hastings . She planted her hands on her desk and pushed herself to her feet . " This is beyond ludicrous . It 's insane . Anyone with a slice of brain can see that it will never work . " Tabitha tilted her head . " I do n't know , Eugenia , I think it 's a very clever plan . " " Simple , too , " Cyrus said . " I 'm a big believer in keeping things as simple as possible . " Eugenia realized that the situation was deteriorating rapidly . " It 's simple , all right . Simple minded . " " Everyone 's a critic , " Cyrus said . Eugenia tried hard not to grind her teeth . In spite of the abundant evidence to the contrary , she was very sure that whatever else he was , Cyrus Chandler Colfax was not simple . Her eyes met his , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A frisson of awareness brought all of her nerve endings to full alert . She knew this sensation . It was the same feeling she got when she looked into one of the first-century B.C. Egyptian glass bowls on display in the Ancient Glass wing of the museum . There was power here . It drew her even as it set off alarms . In fairness to a civilized society , Colfax should have been required to wear caution flags and a lot of flashing red lights to warn the unwary against approaching too close . The Hawaiian shirt did not do the job . She was certain that Cyrus 's laid-back ways were a facade . She knew that as surely as she knew the difference between fourteenth-century Islamic glass and Chinese glass from the early years of the Qing dynasty . His strong , ruthless hands and enigmatic green eyes told the real truth . Even as she tried to assess him , he was sizing her up with a hunter 's focused interest and intelligence . She was sure that he did not intend for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Two could play at that game , she thought . Which meant they had a standoff . She made one last stab at warding off the inevitable . " Tabitha , you ca n't possibly expect me to work under these conditions . " " Nonsense . " Tabitha 's shrewd eyes burned with the fires of excitement . " Where 's your sense of adventure ? Why , if I did n't have so many commitments here in Seattle during the next few weeks , I 'd be tempted to go in your place . " Not a chance , Eugenia vowed silently . She had no intention of allowing anyone , not even Tabitha Leabrook , to go to Frog Cove Island in her stead . But she needed to be free to pursue her own plans , and that meant she had to be in charge of the situation . From what little she had seen , Colfax did not appear to be the easily managed type . She picked up the plump , 1930s-era fountain pen she used to sign official correspondence and lounged back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to cooperate in this fiasco ? " " Easy . " Cyrus shoved his hands into his pockets and smiled benignly . " I tell the Daventry estate folks that you wo n't assist the investigation . " She waited for the other shoe to drop . When Cyrus did not say anything else , she rolled the fat pen between her palms . " That 's it ? " she asked . " Well , not quite , " Cyrus said slowly . " After I tell the estate executors that the Leabrook was uncooperative , they will probably instruct their lawyers to tie up the assets of the Daventry estate as long as possible . " Eugenia closed her eyes . " I figure that a good legal team could probably arrange to keep the Daventry glass collection out of the hands of the Leabrook for four or five years , " Cyrus continued . " Maybe longer . " A cold chill went through Eugenia . She opened her eyes and sat very still . Tabitha 's mouth dropped open in shock . " My God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . It 's an incredible collection . " Eugenia watched Cyrus closely . " He 's bluffing , Tabitha . " Cyrus raised his brows . He was not bluffing , Eugenia thought . If she did not cooperate , he would convince the executors to tie up the estate . The Leabrook could wind up spending a fortune fighting for the bequest in court . " That 's blackmail , " she said . " Eugenia , really , that 's going much too far , " Tabitha chided . " Mr. Colfax is not issuing a threat . He 's merely telling us what the executors ' reaction , will be if he is n't allowed to conduct his investigation . " " Like heck he is . He 's threatening us , Tabitha . " Tabitha made a tut-tutting sound . " You 're overreacting , my dear . And it 's all moot in any case . I 've already agreed to assist him , and not just because it will please the Daventry estate . " " I know , I know , " Eugenia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm being cautious . " Tabitha 's expression turned serious . " If there is a possibility that Adam Daventry was murdered , the motive might very well have had something to do with his art collection . I do not want you staying alone with all that valuable glass and only that caretaker person for protection . " Eugenia knew when she was beaten . " All right , Tabitha , if you insist , I 'll go along with this idiotic scheme . " Tabitha beamed . " Thank you , my dear . It will be a tremendous load off my mind to know that you 'll have Mr. Colfax with you at Glass House . " " There is one small stipulation , " Eugenia added gently . Cyrus 's gaze sharpened fractionally . " What 's that ? " " I get to choose the cover story we use , " Eugenia said briskly . " Given the extremely limited range of options , I 'll have to settle for the one in which you pose as my assistant . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one will work real well , " Cyrus said . " Too bad . " She glared at him . " It 's the only one I 'm prepared to consider . " Cyrus nodded . " Mind if I ask why you chose that one instead of the one in which we pose as a couple on vacation ? " She eyed his shirt . " I would have thought it was obvious . It 's going to be difficult enough to pass you off as my assistant . But I can absolutely guarantee that never in a million years would it be possible to convince anyone that we were a couple . " " I get it , " Cyrus said . " You 're trying to tell me that I 'm not your type . " She thought about the unsubtle threat he had issued a moment ago . " No , " she said . " You 're definitely not my type . And there 's one more thing I want clear here . I do n't know much about private investigators , but I 've noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a real-life investigator , Ms. Swift , not a TV private eye . " " I trust that means you do n't actually carry a gun around with you . I absolutely refuse to share a house with a strange man who carries a gun . I detest guns . " " So do I. " Cyrus moved his left shoulder slightly . " I once had a nasty experience with one . " At six-thirty that evening , Eugenia poured herself a glass of chilled sauvignon blanc and went to stand at her living room window . Her condominium was located midway up in a high-rise building in the heart of the city . She had paid extra for the view of Elliott Bay , but she considered the money well spent . Something about vast expanses of water was soothing to her soul . She had spent the last four months engaged in a major remodeling project , which was finally complete . She had ordered the architect to tear down every wall except those needed for privacy in the bath and bedroom . The background color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of West Coast studio glass art . The contemporary glass sculptures glowed on carefully lit pedestals arranged around the room . An arched entry divided the hall from the white-carpeted living room . A low , white sofa and white leather chairs together with some glass tables comprised the furnishings . The only color in the room besides the brilliantly hued glass sculptures was around the gas fireplace . Eugenia studied the hand-painted amber and green tiles that formed the fireplace surround . Nellie Grant had designed them for her . The last time she had seen Nellie was here in this very room . The remodeling had been in its final stages . The wall beside the fireplace had still , been open and tiles had been stacked on the floor , when Nellie appeared at the front door . That had been the morning after Adam Daventry had fallen to his death . Rather than wait for the private ferry that served Frog Cove Island , Nellie had used Daventry 's launch to get to the mainland . She had rented a car and driven an hour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieving . You were right , Eugenia . He was a bastard . I should have listened to you . I 'm not sorry he 's dead . I know that sounds awful , but it 's the truth . I have to return to the island this afternoon to get the rest of my stuff , but after that I never want to see the place again . Eugenia glanced at the painting above the recently completed fireplace . It was one of Nellie 's works , the first in a series called Glass , she had explained . It depicted a late-nineteenth-century French vase from the Daventry collection . Nellie had captured the rich , vibrant colors and the enthralling effects of fight shining through the glass . Daventry said that since he had no children for me to paint , he wanted me to do some portraits of his favorite glass pieces . I did four of them before he died Now that he 's gone , I figure they belong to me . I want you to have this one , Eugenia . Sort of a housewarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nellie had been eager to get her career as an artist under way . Eugenia suspected that was one of the reasons she had fallen victim to Daventry 's charm . He had convinced her that he could introduce her to the right people and get her work hung in the most prestigious galleries . Eugenia walked , slipper-shod , across the new white rug . She paused beside a pedestal and gazed into the swirling green depths of a whimsical glass sculpture that had been created by a young artist in Anacortes . Watching the play of light on beautiful glass always helped her to clarify her thoughts . After a moment she reached for the phone on the table beside the sofa . She flipped open a card file and found the home number of her friend at Mills &; Mills , the firm that handled the Leabrook 's security . The same intuition that she relied on so heavily when it came to art was sending small warning signals concerning Cyrus Chandler Colfax . It told her that he was not what he seemed . " Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's nearly seven . " Sally Warren sounded startled . " Are you still at the museum ? " " No , I 'm home . " Eugenia sank down onto the arm of the sofa . " I 'm going out of town the day after tomorrow . I need some information . " " Finally going to take a vacation , huh ? About time . I 'll bet you ca n't even remember the last one you took . " Eugenia frowned . " Of course I do . I went to England two years ago . " " And spent all of your time in the glass collections at the Ashmolean and the British Museum . But we 'll let that pass . What do you need ? " " Mills &; Mills has been in the security business for a long time , right ? " " Thirty years , " Sally agreed . " You must know all of the other major security firms on the West Coast . " " Probably . Why ? " " I met one of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? " There was a short , startled silence on the other end of the line . " Colfax ? " Sally sounded distinctly cautious . " Yes . Do you know him ? " " I 've never met him , but I 've heard about him . I would n't call him a competitor . He does n't go after the same business . Mills &; Mills specializes in museum security . Colfax usually does corporate and private stuff . Very exclusive . Very expensive . " Eugenia tightened her grip on the phone . " What can you tell me about him ? " " Wait a second , you 're not thinking of moving the Leabrook account to Colfax Security , are you ? " " No , of course not . But I want to know whatever you can get on him . " " It will take me a while . Mind if I ask why you need to know about Colfax ? " " Because I 'm going to spend my summer vacation with him . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
