Very early on in All the Trouble in the World ( Grove/Atlantic ; 340 pages ; $22 ) , P.J. O'Rourke 's look at " the lighter side " of overpopulation , famine , ecological disaster and other global environmental woes , the reader begins to wonder whether somewhere between writing Republican Party Reptile and this latest effort the author suffered a stroke . Left intact are O'Rourke 's accustomed descriptive flair and facility for throwaway lines  --  " ' dying like flies ' is not a simile you 'd use in Somalia . The flies wax prosperous and lead full lives . " Gone , however , is any faculty for building an argument . <P> In this disjointed collection of essays and articles , as in earlier books , O'Rourke assumes the role of libertarian praise singer , extolling the virtues of free markets and heaping scorn on the evils of clumsy , intrusive Big Government . He takes the position that despite the whining of enviros , people throughout the world have never been better off and that doomsayers who exaggerate the threat of ecological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In essence , he is offering the Wall Street Journal editorial page with a laugh track . <P> O'Rourke serves up his witticisms with plenty of statistics that support his views , and a reader might reasonably assume that he has undertaken exhaustive research . In fact , the book betrays a disturbing ignorance . The World Bank , for instance , does not squander money by making loans to poor nations " that will be paid back when the Pope sits shiva . " Were it only so  --  then the bank might stop making its ecologically dubious investments . Much of the recent criticism leveled at the institution has been that it makes too much money from those loans , not too little . <P> All right , reading a political humorist for details about the World Bank is as sensible as studying Oliver Stone 's movie JFK for the facts of the Kennedy assassination . O'Rourke is after larger truths . But even the internal consistency of All the Trouble in the World is skewed . For example , to score points off former communists , O'Rourke catalogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but elsewhere he calls an unpolluted environment a " luxury good " and derides clean-up programs in the U.S. In one part of the book pollution helps trees ; in another it kills them . <P> Like an out-of-shape fighter , O'Rourke chooses to pummel stiffs and has- beens . He wastes pages going after 50 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Planet , a quickly forgotten by-product of 1992 Earth Day hype . When he does take on a substantial foe , like Vice President Al Gore , he becomes almost hysterical , lumping Gore with Nazis and other totalitarians for observing that the world may be forced to respond to the global environmental crisis in a " collective , coordinated way . " <P> The book 's assertions will have many greens reaching for their beta- blockers . Among the most provocative : the argument that Bangladesh 's problems must not stem from overpopulation since the city of Freemont , California , is just as crowded and yet sustains a pleasant , middle-class life- style ; the idea that most Amazon Indians would rather move out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sanctimonius beatnik . " Still , O'Rourke is funny . In the Amazon he encounters one Yagua Indian with a grass skirt so elaborate that " he was lucky he had n't been declared an endangered ecosystem from the waist down .
