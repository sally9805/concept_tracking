Coyoacanthe outskirts of Tenochtitlan-Mexico1583 . The Franciscan monk approached the convententrance , cautiously tugged at the rope that rang the steps of the gatekeeper . When a small window cut intothe door opened , he caught a glimpse of a woman 's wrinkledface . The white wimple framing her head hid anyother signs of age . " Good morning , Sister . I 'm the new confessor , Father Benito Lara . " The nun had small , myopic eyes that stared at thepriest 's face unabashedly . " You 're young . Much youngerthan the one we had before you . " She shut the panel with a thud that forced him toblink involuntarily , then he heard the brass key turnloudly in the lock , followed by the creaking of hinges asthe door lumbered open . Father Benito stepped into thevast cloister enclosed within the convent . He wasmomentarily halted by the nun who took time to scanhim from top to bottom . She saw that he was of a mediumbuild , thin , light-complected , and that his hair , already beginning to thin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit he wore was asyet not frayed or threadbare . " I see that you have n't been a friar that long . Let ussee how this land treats you and if you can accustomyourself to it . " Father Benito did not catch the full meaning of thenun 's words , but he nevertheless followed her quietlywhen she motioned him to come into the corridor . To hisleft , the priest took in the images of saints , prophets andangels sculpted into the walls . To his right , his eyesscanned a garden shaded by orange , lemon and pomegranatetrees . The place was lined with clay pots filledwith geranium andbougainvillea flowers . A large stonefountain was at the center of the garden . As he walked , he could make out the sound of splashing water , its tinklingmingled with the scraping of his sandals on the tilefloor . He followed silently until the nun led him to asecluded nook at the end of the main cloister , where hewas able to make out the figure of an elderly woman . Hesaw that she was sitting in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nagging Mother Superior to get her aconfessor . Really , she can be such a nuisance eventhough she is an old woman ! She knew that we had towait until a new priest was assigned to the convent , butoh , no ! She demanded special attention right away ! Shekeeps reminding us that she 's nooo-bi-li-ty . " The nunpuckered her mouth and mockingly slurred the word . " Please , Sister , it 's no bother . Besides , as you say , she is very old , and perhaps she senses that her end isnear . The spirit many times tells the body . . . " The nun did not allow Father Benito to finish . " These people are not like us , Father . They have no spirit ! " Even though she had mumbled , the priest made outwhat she said . " Do n't say that , Sister . You 're wrong . We 're all God'schildren . Now , if you will allow us to be alone for a while.I 'll let you know when I 'm finished . " When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the frail woman with the waning autumn lightspilling over her bony shoulders . She appeared to be lostin thought and seemed to sing as she rocked back andforth in her chair . He realized that she was even olderthan he had thought when he first saw her . Her skinlooked brittle and transparent , yellowish-brown in tone.His eyes shifted to concentrate on the old woman'shands and noticed that they were tiny and tightlyencased in thin skin ; they fluttered nervously from timeto time . " Like brown swallows , " he thought . He stepped closer , hoping to get her attention , butshe was oblivious to his presence . As he got closer to her , he confirmed that he had been right . She was singing , but he could not make out the words of her song . FatherBenito was now so near the old woman that he could seethat her face was small , skeletal , and that one of her eyesockets was empty ; its darkened hollow was markedwith scars . Her hair was white , coarse and stringy , andit was fastened tightly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the old woman with suchconcentration that when her face suddenly whippedaround to look at him , he was startled . He flinched withunexpected fright . Her good eye , he saw , was bird-likeand it glared at him with a black , flinty pupil that madehim shiver . " Ah ! You must be the priest who has come to hearmy last confession . " Father Benito was taken by surprise and he couldn'tfind words with which to answer . As he was scoldinghimself for being so awkward , he heard himself say , " Last confession ? Senora , what makes you think such athing ? " She giggled , exposing toothless gums . Her nosehooked downward , giving her the look of an eagle . " PerhapsI should say , my only confession , because I havenever told any of your priests the real sins of my life.Come , sit here by me . " She pointed to a small chair that Father Benito hadnot seen before . He moved closer to her as he tried tomake himself comfortable in the seat . She stared at himsteadily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cord that hung from his waist . Notknowing what to say , the priest mutely reached into hispocket and pulled out a purple stole . The woman lookedat him with more intensity as he clumsily fixed the stripof cloth around his shoulders . " You 're very young . Where were you born ? " " In Carmona , Senora , " he stammered . " Over there ? ' She pointed her nose at a spot somewherebehind him . He unthinkingly swiveled his head tolook at where she had pointed , but saw only the fadedstucco of the convent wall . After a few moments , however , he understood what she had asked . " Yes , I 'm from Spain . I was born in a small villageoutside of Seville . " He paused for a few seconds , waiting for her to speak , but she had returned to her silence.Clearing his voice , Father Benito asked , " And you , Senora , where were you born ? " " Here . " With that , the woman returned to her silence . Father Benito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She ignored his question . " I was born here , wherethis building , this house of women has now been constructed.My father 's house was built on this very place . " Seeing that the priest was confused by what shehad said , she added more . " That housethe first onewasdestroyed by Captain General Cortes before he gavethe land to your people . He and his captains did much ofthat , but I suppose it was all meant to be . " The woman focused her eye on the monk . " How oldare you ? " " Twenty-seven . " She ran her tongue over dry lips as she wagged herhead in calculation . I was born eighty-two years ago , during the Melancholy Days . In your reckoning , springof the year 1501 . What I am remembering happenedmany years before you were born . But perhaps you knowsome of the details of those times . I mean those dayswhen your captains and your four-legged beasts cameacross the waters to infest our world . " Father Benito was jolted by the sharp edge of herremark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , reminding her of the blessings the Spaniardshad brought to her people . He decided instead to keephis words to himself . After all , he told himself , she wasonly an old woman and they had just met . The woman sighed , moving her head from side toside despondently . " We were guided by a divine trinity.One brother was all-knowing , the other was a preacherand priest , but the last one thirsted for human hearts . " " You 're confused , Senora . That is not the Trinity at all . " Father Benito 's voice was urgent , rising above thesoft garden sounds ; it echoed in the hollows of the cloisterceilings . She ignored the monk and spoke as if lost in thesolitude of another time , another place . " With the passageof time my people grew to revere this third brother , forgetting the good one , listening to words prompting theMexicas to wage war in this land and to gather newofferings for him , the lord of blood . So it was that mypeople abandoned the planting of maize and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benito 's body shivered with the same revulsionhe used to feel when he was a schoolboy listening tohis teachers tell of what the explorers had encounteredin the Indies . He remembered letters , circulated andread everywhere , even from church pulpits . He recalledvivid descriptions of bloodied temples , hearts carved outby obsidian knives , human flesh devoured by blood-encrustedwarlocks who called themselves priests . Hismind flashed back to the solemn requiem mass that hadbeen dedicated to the memory of two soldiers , natives ofhis hometown ; they had been slashed and eaten by thosesorcerers . He was deep into his memories when he wasstartled back to the present by the woman 's words . " In the beginning , I did n't understand why thetribes surrounding us became our enemies so easily , butnow that I am old , it 's clear to me . It was because of thatgod 's constant demand for human hearts that webecame feared , and then detested . It had to be ! Then , ontop of it all , the preacher god unleashed his wrath on ourfaithlessnessjust as he had promised . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Father Benito knew that this was not a confession , but he was intrigued by what the woman was saying . Hehad never heard of those events told by someone likeher , someone native to that land . He moved closer to her , straining to grasp her lilting words , which had become more and more accented as she drifted back in time . " The Mexica people were splintered by theSpaniards and we were cast out of our kingdom likescattered leaves . We had thought that we were the lightof the universe and that our city was the mirror of theworld . Instead we were uprooted and destroyed by yourpeople . When it first happened , we were wracked byhunger and pestilence ; all we did was weep because wesaw that now we were the strangers in this land , notyou . Our warriors were humiliated and died with dirt intheir mouths . As for me , I was young then , and with mychildren I walked aimlessly among crowds of lost , driftingpeople . Like everyone else , I wailed , hoping that thegods would feel pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hadrevealed secrets unintentionally . After some momentsshe sighed , and whispered , " But that was then . It 's overnow . " Father Benito felt embarrassed by what he hadheard . Not knowing what to say , he waited , hoping thatthe right words would come to him . Nothing elseoccurred to him , so he decided to have the woman beginher confession . Senora , the morning is drawing to a close , and Imust return to say mass this afternoon . Please , shall webegin ? In name of the Father , and of the Son , and of theHoly Gh . . . " She interrupted the priest . " You want to hear mysins , do n't you ? " Her voice was shrill and transformedfrom its previous soft tones . When Father Benito staredat her without answering , she added , " You do n't evenknow my name , and you want to hear my sins . " " It is you who have called me to come . Please ! Let usbegin . " This time he silently made the sign of the cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know thedifficulty my language causes your tongue , you may callme Hummingbird , since that is what the word means . " She smoothed the folds of the shawl that outlined thesharp angles of her shoulders . " Although I am now destitute , I am of noble birth , adescendent of Mexica kings . My life has been a pathwhich has taken unforeseen turns . The first of thoseunexpected twists happened long before the arrival ofyour captains , when I was still a girl . On that day Zintleand I went swimming . ' " Swimming is not a sin . " " Is fornication a sin ? " Father Benito blushed so intensely that the skinaround his eyebrows took on a purplish hue . He wasagain without words , so he averted his face from herquestioning gaze . " Zintle was my cousin . He , too , was noble and likeme , he paid a high price for that happenstance . You'llhear more about him later on . On the day I am speakingof , he and I ran toward the river . We romped andjumped . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we snaked back and forth , all the while lettingout whoops and squeals of joy . We ran , unconsciousof our young vigor , taking the gift of energy lightly . Weran until we lost our breath . Then we flopped on thewatercress that covered the river embankment . I canstill smell its sweetness , its damp , green matting . ' Huitzitzilin stopped speaking and turned to look atthe monk . She saw that even though his head was lowered , he seemed to be listening to her . " We laughed , snorting through our noses and thengiggling even more at the sounds we were making . Whatmade us laugh so much ? I do n't know . " " Senora , forgive me , but this is really not . . . " Huitzitzilin held up her hand stiffly , sticking it infront of the monk 's face as she countered his complaint.It 's coming ! " " What ? ' " The sin . That 's what you want to hear , is n't it ? " This time Father Benito 's face reflected irritation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's idea . He said that we should take offour clothes . I did . When I looked at him I saw that wewere different . At the time , I had not yet reached myfirst bleeding . " The woman stopped speaking and looked at FatherBenito . He was self-consciously staring at the tiled floor , so she returned to her confession . " We jumped into the water , splashing each other , screaming shrilly , as if the drops burned our skin . Wepretended fear when one would push the other into thewater , and we scooped gulps of water into our mouths , spitting it out , spraying each other . " Then Zintle did something that both of us thoughtvery funny . He waded out to the edge , plucked a largegreen leaf from an overhanging tree , poked a holethrough its center with his finger , and then hooked theleaf onto his penis . We were both astounded that the leaflooked exactly like a green and gold stemmed flowerclinging to his body . At first we stared at it , then weburst out laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I could do was stick my finger through aleaf and hold it tightly to my body . " When we tired of so much laughing , we left thewater to lie on the grass to dry ourselves . Without sayinganything , Zintle rolled over onto his side , his facejust above mine . We had never done this before , andeven though we knew that it was wrong for a maiden todo such a thing before marriage , we did nothing to stopit . There was something different in his eyes , and Ithink he saw the same look in my eyes . Soon I felt hisbreath on my cheeks and his lips brushing my eyes , mychin , my lips . Then he got on top of me and I could feelhis masculine part hovering in the area between mylegs . " " Senora , please ! You can be sure that I understandclearly that you fornicated with that boy . You need notdescribe it any further . " Father Benito got to his feet andstood in front of Huitzitzilin . He looked down at heruplifted face ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have not confessed this sin before . Awoman of your age . . . " " No ! I have never said this to anyone because I havenever told anyone about my life . " The priest seemed perplexed . " Why are you tellingme these things ? " " Because I will soon die , and someone must knowhow it was that I and my people came to what we arenow . Please , young priest , sit here and listen to me . " Father Benito obeyed her despite his evident desireto leave . " I absolve you of your sins . " With one hand heldflat against his chest he lifted the other in preparationto utter the prayer of absolution . But Huitzitzilin interrupted him . She spoke rapidly . " Wait a minute ! There 's more . " " There 's more ? " The priest , hand frozen in midair , quizzically echoedthe woman 's words . He gaped at the woman for a longtime before he realized that his mouth was hangingopen . Knowing that he looked foolish , he clamped itshut ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down at his feet for some time before hedecided what to do . " I must leave now . I 'll return tomorrow at thistime .
