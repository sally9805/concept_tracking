Terra-cotta adds a timeless touch to the garden . // Terra-cotta pots cradle a plant as naturally as a parent 's arms enfold a newborn . Formed for their function and made stable by the potter 's fire , these containers are so simple yet so appropriate for the plants and soil that fill them . Although terra-cotta pots are breakable , those that survive only get better with time , developing dignity and patina with use and age . Fastidious gardeners may want to clean their pots to rid them of lingering insects and diseases , but a scrub brush also cleanses them of character . Moss thrives on the constant moisture of daily watering , blanketing the earthen vessel with green . Fertilizer permeates the pores of the clay and rises to the rim where it dries to a white crust , a testament to a gardener 's care . The mottled colors that result are the colors of earth . In fact terra-cotta means " baked earth . " A worn pot seems more fit for its purpose than it did when it was new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot remains a mystery of history . Evidence exists that the Mediterraneans grew plants in pots prior to 2000 B.C. The Romans had written instructions for rooting trees in pots before Christ was born . But it has only been in the last 200 years that the practice has spread to almost every household and the clay pots have begun to stack up . Early pots were thrown on a wheel with all the wonderful irregularities that human hands leave behind . They were tapered from rim to base , allowing rooted plants to be turned upside down , tapped on the edge of the potting bench , and slipped easily into a waiting palm . It is the slight variation in size , shape , and surface that give these pots their appeal-and their price-when you come across them in antiques shops . Photograph ( Left ) Gardens are beautiful , and so are a gardener 's implements . Consider the simplicity of terra-cotta , a weathered bench , and the work-worn handle of a border spade . Earthen pots in a myriad of forms await the gardener 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new pots represent traditional shapes and proportions . The three tall ones are known as long toms and are used for taprooted plants . The second from the left is a standard pot ; the second from the right is called an azalea pot and is used for shallowrooted plants . // Modern pots are molded , and the original tapered shape has not been improved . But more often than not they have a rim . This allows for stacking them with no jamming or breaking . The rim also gives the gardener a better grasp on the edge of the pot . However , the appeal of the handmade pot is alive and well . The work of Jim Keeling 's Whichford Pottery in England and American craftsman Guy Wolff of Connecticut commands top dollar . At the other end of the spectrum , recent innovations in flowerpots include the advent of plastic and fiberglass . And in many ways , these materials have an advantage over clay . They are lightweight and do n't break as easily . Plastic is superior for rooting cuttings because the soil does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't crack in winter 's freezing temperatures . To be sure , winter brings an end to many a terracotta pot . The porous material soaks up moisture that will freeze and cause terra-cotta to crumble . To avoid such calamities , pots need to be emptied and turned upside down at the very least . It is even better if you have a shed or garage in which to stack them , sheltered from the weather . Earthen pots have their virtues , however . The pores in terra-cotta allow plant roots to breathe , which is good for a living thing . This also means that the soil will dry more quickly , but daily watering is probably necessary in hot weather no matter what kind of pot you choose . And frequent watering flushes excess salts from the soil . But these reasons sound like rationalizations for the real reason gardeners prefer terra-cotta : Plants just look better in terra-cotta . That 's why we bother to garden in the first place-for the beauty of it . O <p>          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
