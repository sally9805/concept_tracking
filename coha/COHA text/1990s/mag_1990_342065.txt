Among the members of Congress raising the greatest ruckus as Washington descended into budgetary chaos were those most responsible for creating the mess in the first place . There were Reaganite conservatives like Newt Gingrich of Georgia for whom vote-winning formulas  --  including the infamous " Read my lips , no new taxes "  --  are more important than the national interest . There were Democratic liberals like Henry Waxman of California , whose vision of the government as a cash cow for special interests helped spawn taxpayer revolts and voodoo economics . And there were the special-interest lobbyists whose phone-bank politics stampeded Congress into yet another crazed dash to the precipice . <P> But Congress is not solely  --  or even primarily  --  to blame . For a decade the Reagan and Bush administrations have been submitting fraudulent , free- lunch budgets that promised huge tax cuts , a social " safety net , " a " kinder , gentler " nation , improved education , a war on drugs , the greatest military buildup in peacetime history and  --  most fraudulent of all  --  a balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who played a crucial role in negotiating the budget compromise that was at the center of last week 's maelstrom , was himself guilty of preparing a budget that was a monument to Reaganite wishful thinking . Bush 's nationally televised paean to the homely virtues of a balanced checkbook might have carried a lot more weight in both the country and in Congress had he not won office two years ago with a promise to reduce the deficit without raising taxes . It was precisely such claims  --  that there is a free lunch after all  --  that got the U.S. into its fiscal mess . <P> Some analysts think they have detected a bipartisan " throw the bums out " mood building among the electorate this year . If so , it is a mood to be encouraged . Elections for the House and a third of the Senate will be held in less than a month , and the voters , having witnessed the spectacle in $ Washington , could do worse than simply elect challengers across the board . They could , as a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incumbents for another term of madness . And if , two years hence , the voters are no longer willing to tolerate presidential candidates who run for office with the kind of flag-draped , meanspirited and economically illiterate campaign that propelled Bush to the White House in 1988 , so much the better .
