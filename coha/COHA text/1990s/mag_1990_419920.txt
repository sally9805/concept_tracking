Where textbooks are written in trees and lessons are taken straight from life itself . <p> The teacher stands not before a blackboard or a pull-down chart of a frog 's arteries but before a 20-mile-deep vista of pointed mountaintops , a conifer forest , a butte , a valley covered with sagebrush , and a rich , unblemished blue sky . Turning , he indicates an area of scientific interest not with a pointer but with a dirty stick . His students are sitting on patches of blue-bunch wheatgrass and balsam root . The rustle they hear off to their right comes not from the covert slide of a paper missile into a wastebasket but from the clawing of dirt by a vole looking for seeds . Above their heads is a bald eagle , circling . <p> It 's a classroom scene at the Teton Science School ( TSS ) , a 23-year-old private , non-profit , science-education center near Jackson Hole , Wyoming , and the students on the wheatgrass are getting what school brochures call " handson or " experiential " education . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside Grand Teton National Park , on an old dude ranch made up of twenty-seven rustic log buildings , one of them a laboratory with computers and a 14-inch telescope , another a museum with 7,500 natural-history specimens , including animal droppings from over 100 species . Up to thirty-two students at a time share the campus with the occasional wandering moose , long-tailed weasel , badger , and pine marten . By arrangement , the school has access to 10 million acres of the Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks and nearby Bridger-Teton , Targhee , and Shoshone national forests , plus surrounding land for outdoor study  --  and 80 percent of the study at Teton Science School is done outdoors . <p> The students on the hillside might , for instance , be studying geology  --  scrutinizing the valley with its odd little butte , its broad flat bottom , and its wall of rock rising on the far side almost without foothills for evidence of glacial action . Or they might be learning about the several life zones displayed so dramatically before them , the sagebrush flats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coniferous forest . Or they might be concentrating on material closer at hand  --  on the hill around them , counting animal tracks and noting plants that had blossomed since their last visit , as part of a long-term monitoring program comparing northern and southern exposures of the hill at different elevations . <p> Some 2,500 students come through TSS in a year , ranging from fifth-graders to Elderhostelers , those dedicated students redux . In the summer , TSS offers adult seminars on such subjects as Wolf Recovery , River Channels , Alpine Ecology , and Bringing Back the Trumpeter Swan taught by outside experts like Luna Leopold and Allen Stokes . It offers college courses on Fire Ecology ( the recent fire in the Yellowstone ecosystem having apparently proved a pedagogical bonanza ) and Hoofed Mammals , with students living at a field station four miles from campus on Forest Service land . It gives extended courses for junior high and high school students on basic ecology and natural history . And during the school year , every fifth grader in the Jackson Hole area spends 21/2 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in winter ) . <p> What all students get during their stay , whether for one day or six weeks , is , according to director Jack Shea , " very much driven by science . " He asks , " What better way for a kid to understand the physics of snow than to dig a snow cave and spend the night in it ? " At TSS even the youngest students are able to do research . " They can formulate testable questions , collect field data , and analyze that data on their computers , " says Brad Stelfox , TSS research director . Right after the big Yellowstone fire , fifth graders gathered lodgepole-pine cones , took them back to their schools , planted them , noted what percentage reproduced and how severely burned those cones were , and gave the regeneration results to the Forest Service , which seemed grateful to get them . <p> TSS students are also expected to keep wildlife-observation cards , noting whenever they see an animal , its sex and age group ( if determinable from a distance ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and whether it was foraging , walking , playing , bedding down , etc . Says Stelfox , " It forces them to go beyond saying , ' There 's a moose . " ' Shea explains the school rationale : " All too often science education stops at the ' oh wow ' stage , or connecting people with the wonders of nature . We see science as a way of bridging the gap between a small interest in natureand a stewardship role , between identifying flowers and citizen action . Scientific information empowers people . " <p> For almost half the school year at TSS there 's snow on the ground , so students ski and snowshoe to study sites , or they may take a sleigh ride in the National Elk Refuge to watch thousands of elk paw at tie snow to expose bits of grass , while farther down the valley , in deeper snow , the longer-legged moose are browsing on willows . " Being out in the subject matter , " says the school 's educational director , Craig Kesselheim , " seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up . They 're much more receptive than in a 40-minute school period . " One student became so fascinated with his study of animal tracks and signs at TSS that for weeks after hereturned home to New York , his mother later wrote the school , he would lean down to examine dog scat on the city streets . <p> Teton Science School is one of a large handful of private science-education centers on federal natural lands ( parks , forests , refuges , recreation areas , send Bureau of Land Management lands ) . More than a dozen are in the western United States , including Yosemite Institute , Keystone Science School , Glacier Institute , Canyonlands Field Institute , Pt . Reyes Field Seminars , Olympic years , The Four Corners School of Outdoor Recreation , and North Cascades Institute . A dozen or so more are scattered around the rest of the country on ( usually smaller federal holdings . In addition , there are many public centers , run mostly by the National Park Service or the Forest Service on their own lands and varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided walk to programs like the one in Everglades National Park in which elementary-school children fromt wo of the largest public-school systems in the country take up in which elementary-school children from two of the largest public-school systems in the country take up to eight classes a day as part of their standard curriculum . Together , private and public centers on federal lands are greatly outnumbered by centers on federal lands are private , state , municipal , school-district , etc ) , yet those with a federal conncection have an important role to play in science education , in some cases one that can not be duplicated . <p> At 5,000 students a year , Yosemite Institute in California is probably the largest of the private centers on Western federal natural lands . It has a campus within Yosemite National Park so that students , most of them California schoolchildren , are exposed in hydrology classes to exhibits such as hanging waterfalls , braided streams , and ox-bow ponds . For their geology classes they see glacially carved staircases , volcanic rocks , and granite cliffs , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sessions at Yosemite last nearly a week , and each day of the week has " kind of its own theme , " says director Brian Empe , although , " if we happen to see a coyote in the meadow , mousing on botany day , we do n't ignore it . " On geology day , for example , students might hike the mile and a half up the steep Yosemite Falls trail to Columbia Point Overview , where they suddenly emerge from heavy liveoak cover to a wide-open view of a canyon below and Half Dome rising 4,000 feet above the canyon floor . " Pretty dramatic stuff , " says Empe . " They forget their aching legs . " <p> Younger students might do " the glacial shuffle " to make the geology lesson clearer . In this game some kids act as a glacier , shuffling through lines of other kids who represent the old V-shape valley , forcing them into a U ( the valley 's current shape ) , and piling up at the end into a terminal moraine . " Content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " However focused you are , if you just lecture in the field you lose them . " <p> After lunch on Columbia Point , the students will spend an hour and a half in " personal reflection , " probably writing in the journals they are expected to keep ( as are students at TSS ) . " We use that for their English , " says Empe . The Yosemite syllabus lists " creative writing in this inspirational setting " as an activity , along with drawing and watercolors . " You ca n't underestimate the value of being surrounded by all this beauty for x number of days , " Empe says . " The esthetics of where we are are important . They 're part of the educational program , a significant part of what we do . " <p> Another organization , Yosemite Field Seminars , is devoted to teaching the public through  --  and about  --  the park . It offers , along with courses like Family Backpack , Vogelsang , and Photographing Wildflowers of Yosemite , some rather specialized courses for adults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the classes involve hiking , but they are " not endurance trips , " insists Penny Otwell , coordinator of the association sponsoring the seminars . " We keep things to a lower level of exercise . You ca n't backpack 13 miles a day and learn about botany . " <p> The Canyonlands Field Institute in Moab , Utah , has a rather mixed curriculum for adults , too : Avalanche Safety Seminars , Wake Up &; Dream : A Raft Trip for Women , as well as Ecology of the Black Bear and Geology of the Red Rocks . None of the courses , insists Marian Ottinger , administrative manager , is " just for the fun of it . Even backpack trips have a naturalist emphasis and are going to be led by a geologist . " Smaller ( 1,000 students ) and newer ( six years old ) than TSS and Yosemite , Canyonlands has a base camp on BLM land and uses Arches and Canyonlands national parks and the Manti-La Sal National Forest for both its children 's and adult classes . One stated purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Colorado Plateau itself to tell its stories "  --  the varied landscapes encompassing canyons , rivers , deserts , mesas , and mountains . <p> Winters are long in Glacier National Park , but from the Spring break-up until the Fall freeze-up , the Glacier Institute is busy holding classes for school groups , senior citizens , and families and offering field seminars for college credit . One of these seminars , Rivers of Ice , involves an overnight stay near Sperry Glacier , one of the largest in the park , and on-scene discussions of glacial formation , scouring , erosion , and movement . A college course on Glacier 's Grizzlies deals not only with the bear 's biology but with the political problems caused by its continued presence in the park . " We bring the question of management into every course , " says Lex Blood , geology professor and cofounder of the institute . " To the degree that students understand the fabric of human and natural history , they 'll be able to participate in management decisions . However , " he insists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply students with information and leave the decisions to them . " <p> Similar restraint is an aim of the Keystone Science School in Keystone , Colorado , which leases 16 acres in the Arapaho National Forest . The school is one branch of The Keystone Center , the other branch being the Keystone Science and Public Policy Program , which , among other things , mediates disputes on environmental matters . Most Keystone students come from public schools along the eastern side of the Rockies , but they tend to be " uneducated about the mountains , " says program coordinator Richard Bloom . " They may ski and jeep and raft in the mountains , but they could n't tell you what a single tree is , where the tree lines begins , what a ptarmigan is , or where silver was discovered . " <p> Silver matters at Keystone , as do gold , fur , and " white gold " ( the snow on ski slopes ) . Like Yosemite and Canyon lands , which give courses on Indian cultures in their regions , Keystones attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a more utilitarian level . It carries a course on Gold and Silver Mining , for which students not only see beaver at their dam-building duties but hear about the history of fur trapping  --  " what opened up this land , " says Bloom . <p> A school not so closely tied to geography and not located on federal natural lands , but which probably has the most permits for teaching on them , is the National Outdoor Leadership School ( NOLS ) . Its headquarters are in Lander , Wyoming , but its courses are conducted in eighteen different national forests , seventeen national parks , and BLM lands in seven states , in both designated and undesignated wilderness . The focus of its program is to develop outdoor skills ( sea kayaking , wilderness horsepacking , etc. ) , values ( " walk lightly on the land " ) , and leadership , but instructors also impart a fair amount of scientific information along the way , says John Gans , public affairs director . " A well-rounded mountaineer does n't just know how to climb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach and understands public lands . " NOLS also offers separate courses on natural history . The predecessor and model for NOLS , Outward Bound , offers " adventure-based education " to 25,000 people a year , mostly on federal natural lands , from Joshua Tree National Monument in California to Great White Heron and National Key Deer wildlife refuges in Florida . Outward Bound 's emphasis is on knowledge of self ( building confidence through physical and emotional challenges like rock climbing and white-water rafting ) , but students usually get some knowledge of natural history in the process . <p> Children can find a less demanding , but no less illuminating , introduction to the natural world at an old honeymoon resort in Pennsylvania , with hearts and sunken bathtubs still in place , near the Delaware River where it carves an S through Kittatinny Ridge : the Pocono Environmental Education Center ( PEEC ) . It 's located on 38 acres inside the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area , which places it within three hours ' drive of 30 percent of the nation 's population , associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who come through in a year are public school children from New York City , Philadelphia , and Jersey City , some of whom have never been out of their cities before . They spend three to five resident days at PEEC  --  in forests , ravines , pastures , and barrens  --  getting familiar with that non-urban form of wildness . <p> " On a good night we take them on a hike to talk about astronomy , " says instructor Elizabeth Freer . " We go offtrail , without flashlights . The city kids are real scared to be away from lights , away from noise , and if there 's an open space they 're afraid of that . They say they 're going to be attacked by a bear . " During the day , armed with nets and containers , the students investigate pond life , much of which  --  if not all  --  is new to them . " They do n't know anything about insect larvae , or salamanders , or tadpoles , or minnows , " says Freer . " By the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Freer maintains she can do a better job teaching kids outdoors than she could in public schools . " It turns what 's on the pages into reality , " she says . " These kids may stay inside the rest of their lives but they learn here that their environment depends in ways on this environment . " <p> A thousand miles farther south , at the Hobe Sound Nature Center on the Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge , which the center uses for field studies ( along with state and city land ) , the same message is being conveyed but with perhaps more urgency . The area , north of Palm Beach , is being " rampantly " developed , says Katie Flannagan , nature-studies instructor . " It 's like a wave moving up the Florida coast . " Many of the newcomers , as well as most of the winter visitors , have a " magazine 's image " of what Florida should be like . " The beach is their wilderness , but beyond playing in the sand and splashing in the waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , " whit the purpose of the dune is , what 's in the ocean , what habitat is important for wildlife . Our job is to tell them . " She leads students on walks along the refuge 's relic sand dunes , with its " endangered " plant population , and " we talk a lot about ' extinction ' and ' forever ' . " <p> At places like Hobe and PEEC , boundaries between federal and non-federal lands are not particularly meaningful ; both centers use both categories of land pretty much indistinguishably . But in many other places , an association with federal lands determines to a large extent the nature of the educational experience . Federal lands tend to be in the West , and they are larger , wilder , and more remote than non-federal ones . " You 'd be hard pressed to find one of these schools closer than 70 or 80 miles from a major population center , " says the Teton Science School 's Jack Shea . " That sets up a certain philosophical milieu ) a mind-set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of outdoor education at Northern Illinois University , " You do n't have to have a pristine environment to instill within a child an appreciation of nature andan understanding of ecosystems  --  you can do that in downtown Manhattan . But with a relatively pristine environment you can compare and contrast ; you can show what an untouched system is  --  an important lesson in itself . People can see systems working in a much grander and larger sense than they can with a rotten log in a neighborhood forest . These are large , working systems , not microcosms . Also , there 's an almost spiritual experience you can get in awilderness area that you ca n't in a local little park , at least not very often . " Shea points out that because the schools are usually connected by formal permit with an agency , " issues of management come up more often than with , say , a local park in Massachusetts . " <p> The students sitting on the hillside near Jackson , Wyoming , if they sit long enough , are going to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They heard that there are proposals to lengthen the runway , which could wipe out the sage-grouse booming ground at one end . In the spring , TSS students go out the runway just before sunrise and watch 70 or 80 grouse strut and flap in a dance of courtship . Chances are that some of the same students came to Jackson Hole by plane . During " debriefings " on their last day before going home , students discuss the choices that will have to be made on this land that they have come to care about . Such management discussions are as much a part of their education at TSS as personal experience are . Science  --  good hands-on science  --  says Shea , is the bridge between them .
