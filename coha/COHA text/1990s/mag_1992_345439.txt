HELMUT KOHL has a bone to pick with BORIS YELTSIN . As the largest contributor of economic aid so far to the troubled republics , Germany is just a tad ticked off by U.S. intelligence reports that the old Soviet Union continues to briskly manufacture nuclear weapons . Among them are SS-18s , SS- 25s and SS-24s traditionally aimed at Western Europe . How come ? Maybe no one remembered to tell the factories to stop . Whatever the explanation , Chancellor Kohl intends to do something about it . While he will continue providing emergency rations to the republics this winter , Germany may halt financing and other long-term aid unless they knock it off .
