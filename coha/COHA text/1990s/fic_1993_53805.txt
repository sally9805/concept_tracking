How could a grown man with any self-respect sit in the Ghirardelli Chocolate Factory at eleven o'clock in the morning and eat a hot fudge sundae with mint chip ice cream , hold the nuts ? It was Charlie 's own question ; his answer was that he was n't a grown man , he was a grown boy , or maybe an ungrown man , pre-grown , never-to-be grown . He was in the process of honing his self-pity into a kind of artifact , an arrowhead he could keep in his pocket , its point ever ready . He spooned pure hot fudge into his mouth and told himself it was Linda 's fault he was doing this  --  if he 'd had someone to account to he 'd never have indulged himself in this way  --  but it gave him no satisfaction to blame her . Linda was his wife , and fifteen days earlier , she 'd taken a suitcase full of clothes and gone to stay with her friend Cynthia " for a little while , " leaving Charlie lower than a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had gone wrong : she no longer said things like " lower than a dead man " or " Nice play , Shakespeare . " Where was that girl ? Not , Charlie felt sure , in San Francisco , this meanly cold , this coldly mean city to which they 'd moved five months before , from his beloved New York , at her request . Whereupon she 'd left him . <p> Charlie looked at his watch . It was now twelve minutes past eleven , and although that left him thirty-three minutes to walk the ten blocks to his doctor 's appointment , he was stricken by a fear of being late  --  a lifelong fear , one of his many crippling lifelong fears . He forced down the last of his sundae as quickly as he could and stood up . He put on his jacket , but as he was wrapping his scarf around his neck , he felt a sharp pain scorch the surface of his upper arm , and he groaned and sat down again . He rubbed at the sore spot with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the pain was too fast for him , disappearing so quickly he sometimes wondered whether it existed at all . It was the other pain , the one in his elbow , that he could count on . More of a dull ache , he would say to the doctor , a consistent dull ache . He stood up again , and as he headed out of the Chocolate Factory , he patted his back pocket to make sure his notebook was still there  --  it contained a list of all the symptoms he 'd had , back to the first radiating heat from his armpit to his fingers in June of 1988 . A few months ago , Linda had joked that he had a sore arm the way other people had a hobby . Sore ? he 'd wanted to say . I 'm in pain .

He was regressing  --  first the sundae and now this . And what do you want to be when you grow up , little boy ? Charlie worked thirty hours a week at a frame shop on Chestnut , a few blocks from the apartment , and he liked it  --  he got a discount on framing materials . Linda said she knew it was a good job ; she wanted him to have a career , but Charlie put careers in a group with pets and lawns  --  people were always talking about them and tending to them , but they just were n't that interesting . <p> In his search to discover what , after all , was wrong with his arm , Charlie had been in many New York waiting rooms during the past couple of years , but this was the first in California , and he did n't know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to a two-hour waiting-room wait followed by a forty-five-minute examining-room wait , sitting there in a paper nightgown . And the New York doctors , who 'd never think to apologize for keeping you  --  Charlie had liked them : their clean , meaty hands , their arrogance . <p> A tall , red-haired woman in a white coat opened a door and said Charlie 's name . He followed her into the doctor 's office , and when she circled the desk , sat down , and said , " So , your arm hurts , " he blushed and buried his face in his hands . Dr. Lee Price . He 'd gotten the name from Linda , who 'd gotten it from someone in her office , and he had n't thought  --  he just had n't thought . <p> " Let me guess , " she said . " You thought I was the nurse . You assumed Lee Price would be a man . You feel like an idiot  --  you 're really not like this . " She smiled at him . " Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part about how I 'm much more of a feminist than a lot of women I know . " <p> " So I did , " she said . " So I did .

" <p> She did n't comment as he talked , but every few minutes she held up a finger for him to pause and scribbled something on an unlined sheet of paper . With her head angled toward the page , he was free to stare at her , and he took in her softly curling auburn hair , her clear , creamy skin , her narrow body . Lovely , he thought , and then , lovely ? It was n't in his working vocabulary . <p> " Any headaches ? " she asked , still bent over her notes . <p> " No more than two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . " And Tylenol does the trick , or no ? " <p> " Tylenol or a nap . I 've always had a lot of headaches . " <p> She nodded and wrote something . " Do you sleep well ? " <p> " I was all-state in high school . I only wish it were an Olympic event . " <p> " A wise guy , " she said , laughing . " Are you married ? " <p> " I  --  " he said . " My  --  " There was an answer to this question  --  it began " Yes , but . . . " <p> " I ask because sometimes people can have small seizures in their sleep without knowing it . If you were married , your wife might have noticed if your sleep were disturbed at all .

Holding his eyelids open with her fingers , she looked into his eyes with a tiny light . Listen , Charlie wanted to say , I 've been through all of this . <p> " Any weakness ? " she asked , pocketing the little flashlight . <p> " I have a little trouble doing this . " Charlie held up his forefinger and with his other hand bent the tip forward . " Bending it at the first joint  --  not exactly life-threatening . " <p> She held her finger up against his . " Push " she said . <p> He tried to bend his fingertip onto hers , but nothing happened . " I noticed it on my camera , about six weeks ago . I had to use my middle finger to hit the shutter .

" <p> " Not to my knowledge , " Charlie said . <p> " You 'd know it . Let 's see if we can get you in later this week . You have insurance , right ? " <p> " I 'm covered by my wife 's group policy at work . " In his jacket pocket was a claim form that Linda had messengered to him from the office  --  better than actually having to see him ! <p> Dr. Price nodded and set down her clipboard . " What does she do , your wife ? " <p> " She 's an architect . " <p> " And you stay home with the kids ? " <p> Charlie put a finger to his chest . " The kid " he said . <p> Charlie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of college . They were at freshman orientation week : their college rented a camp an hour 's drive from campus , and you stayed in cabins with triple-level bunk beds and met during the day with upper classmen to discuss College Life . This was in the Seventies , and everyone wanted to talk . On the first night , each freshman was given a partner to interview for ten minutes and then introduce to a group of twenty . Charlie and his partner sat at a picnic table , and she launched into her background with such zeal that Charlie did n't have to ask any questions . He sat there staring at her  --  this blond-haired , blue-eyed girl from Minnesota , who seemed to have had the kind of childhood his parents referred to as " TV mythology "  --  and he hoped this initial pairing was n't going to last the whole week . His older brother had told him that the people you hung around with during your first few weeks at college ended up being your friends , whether you liked them or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next four years , and he wanted to lean across the table and say , " Neat is the opposite of messy , damn it ! " <p> The girl was Linda . Later that night , after the awkward introductions ( she told the group , " This is Charlie from outside of Boston  --  he likes to read " ) , Charlie overheard her telling another girl that he had eyes you could drown in . He liked that , and for months , long after the word " saddled " was the last he 'd have chosen to describe his feelings about her , he tried to get her to say it to him  --  eyes you could drown in . Then he woke up one night late in the spring of their freshman year , and looked at her , and he realized it was he who had fallen into her , so deeply into her that he could n't feel any boundaries . He was the doubter  --  he hated himself for it , but he tested her in mean , small ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time  --  but he never found the edge of what he was to her ; he was contained by her in a way that frightened and exalted him . <p> Now , fourteen years later , she was gone , and it was n't so much that he was angry or depressed or even scared : he was adrift . <p> During hard times , Charlie found it helpful to formulate a philosophy of life , and the past fifteen days had yielded him a particularly effective one : Bob Dylan . What he perhaps liked best about it was that Dylan had so little appeal to women , meaning Linda . He was an anti-sex symbol , or maybe an anti-sex symbol . That beard , she would say , shuddering . That thumbnail . <p> When he got home from Dr. Price 's , Charlie put " Tangled Up in Blue " on the stereo , turned the volume high , and lay down on the living-room rug . Dr. Price had prescribed yet another anti-inflammatory drug , and Charlie had taken his dose , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grogginess to overcome him . He knew that the new drug would help for a while , but that a few weeks after he stopped it , the pain would balloon into his elbow again . The reason he had waited so long to find a doctor in San Francisco was that he was terrified of becoming addicted . Addicted to Dolobid  --  not a very hip way to go . <p> The phone rang , and he turned off the stereo and answered it . It was Linda , her voice , and it made him ache . <p> " How 'd it go ? " she said . " What 'd he say ? " <p> She , Charlie thought . " I have to go back on Friday morning , " he said . " For an EMG . " <p> " A what ? " <p> " Electro-something . " He paused ; this was sure to displease her . " I 'm not exactly sure what it is . I forgot to ask . " <p> " You 're so funny , " she said stiffly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry  --  I just do n't see how you could forget to ask something like that . " <p> " My arm hurt . " <p> Linda was silent , and he tried to think of a way to save the conversation . " Sorry , " he said finally . " I 'm all drugged up . " <p> " Well , guess what ? Kiro asked me to work on the clinic in Walnut Creek . " <p> " Lin , " Charlie said , " that 's great . We should celebrate . Or you should . Congratulations . " <p> She was silent again , and then she said , in a bright , public voice , " I should get going , but I 'll talk to you soon , O.K. ? " <p> " O.K. , " Charlie said . " Okey-dokey . Till then . " <p> He said goodbye , hung up the phone , and turned the stereo back on . " Oh , shut up , " he said to Dylan , and switched the receiver to the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was playing , and as the violins climbed higher and higher , winding around each other in ever tighter circles , Charlie thought of a string pulled taut , a single translucent nerve stretched end to end , fingertip to brain . <p> An EMG , it turned out , was really two tests . But just one low , low Price : she was on the floor searching for a pen she 'd just dropped . Charlie was lying on a padded table , his arm on a pillow at his side , looking at the pair of imposing machines that would measure the velocity of his nerves and the electric activity in his muscles . He felt queasy . <p> Dr. Price stood up and smiled at him . " We 'll do the nerve velocity test first , " she said . " It may be a little uncomfortable . " <p> " I 've heard that line before . " <p> Again she smiled at him . She adjusted the position of his forearm , then carefully taped a wire to it . " Ready ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a high voltage ? " He tried to look as if he were kidding . " Could you accidentally give me too much ? " Yuk , yuk . <p> " Do n't be scared , " she said . She was so close he could feel her breath on the bare skin of his upper arm . " The strongest shock you could get from this thing would n't feel much worse than a sharp kick . " She held a two-pronged fork to his neck . " We 'll start with the worst so you 'll know there 's nothing to worry about . " <p> The current slammed into his neck , and then it was over . " That was n't so bad , " Charlie said , laughing a little . " That was nothing . " <p> She made a note , then continued down his arm , shocking him here , then there . The worst of it was how she pulled the hairs on his arm when she lifted the tape off . <p> " What a guy , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I call you ? " <p> She set the wires and the fork on the table behind her . She held up a thin cord , on the end of which was a sliver of a needle , an inch and a half long . " Some people think this is worse , " she said , " but it should n't give you any trouble . Ready ? " <p> She slid the needle into a muscle in his forearm , and Charlie felt tears pricking at his eyes . " Ah , " he said , and then , because it had sounded embarrassingly sexual , " Ow . " <p> " O.K. , " she said , " now make a fist . " <p> Such a small , thin needle for such a great , big pain . Charlie 's entire arm hurt , not just where the needle jutted out , but in his hand and wrist , too . She moved the needle around , and he thought he might actually cry . He was aware of a strange crackling sound , like a staticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor . <p> " There , " Dr. Price said , " that was n't so bad , was it ? " She pulled the needle out of his arm , leaving him feeling bruised and exhausted . " Just a few more of these . " <p> Half an hour later , the test over , they sat in her office . Charlie rubbed his hand up and down his arm . He was giddy with relief , eager to be terribly funny or audacious . <p> He looked at Dr. Price  --  Lee , Leonora , not such a bad name , really  --  and he willed himself into a crush on her . That red hair , those green eyes , the fetching white coat : he wanted her , or perhaps he only wanted to want her . Did the fact that it was only eleven o'clock in the morning mean he could n't suggest they go for a drink ? He longed to say , " Let 's ditch this hot dog stand "  --  it was a Linda line , but he felt he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentality . They could have a drink and then a quick wedding , two or three red-haired kids , and a ranch-style house in the suburbs to which he would repair each evening , loosening the knot in his tie , eager for the martini she would have waiting for him . He only had joke ties now  --  a tie that looked like fish scales , a vintage tie a full five inches wide , even a tie made of wood  --  but he could buy one with little white dots , and he would , he would . <p> " . . . very useful , " she was saying . " At least we 've ruled out any denervation . " <p> " What ? " Charlie said . <p> " You passed the test , Mr. Goldman . " <p> " I did ? " <p> " Do n't look so morose . Go , take pictures with your middle finger , be happy . " <p> " But my arm , " Charlie said . " My arm hurts . " <p> " Take the Dolobid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you 'd worn a cervical collar for a while  --  do you still have it ? " He nodded . " Wear it for a month or two . Sleep in it . " She smiled . " You can call me if the pain gets worse . " <p> Back in his own neighborhood , Charlie wandered toward the frame shop , his arm twinging occasionally in memory of the assault it had suffered , and he decided to ask for the afternoon off . He passed in front of a men 's clothing store , and after a moment backtracked and stood looking in its window . Men at Work , it was called  --  the other kind of work . It was a store Linda liked ; when they 'd first arrived in San Francisco , they 'd gone out walking almost every evening , and she 'd steered them into this shop several times : she 'd held up combinations of shirts and ties for his appraisal , saying he 'd look great in this blue or that brown . Charlie was a jeans man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the odd suit to please her . He understood it : he liked watching her try on clothes , too . It was a way of interpolating his love for her : Linda in the silk dress , Linda in the leather jacket , Linda in the slender gray suit  --  he loved them all . He thought of going in and buying a tie to wear as a surprise for her the next time he saw her  --  not one with little white dots , but one he actually liked  --  but then he thought that it would be much better to ask her to come with him , to help him choose one . It was really a pretty good idea  --  maybe he 'd even let her talk him into a suit . Was it so hard , after all , to imagine himself dressed in a suit and tie , taking the bus downtown every morning ? He could see himself carrying a briefcase , could even picture himself passing through a revolving door and standing at a bank of elevators avoiding eye contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself stepping into the elevator , facing the doors , could picture the elevator rising smoothly and speedily to , say , the twenty-third floor  --  but then what ? What did people do in those towers all day long ? What was in the briefcase  --  a tuna sandwich and an apple ? Charlie could n't get himself out of the elevator . <p> At the frame shop , he found Kendra , the nicer of the two owners , in the back room , cutting some mats . Cutting mats  --  now there was work that made sense . He was almost tempted to work his shift , but not quite . <p> " Poor you , " Kendra said when he 'd explained about the EMG . " I do n't trust doctors at all anymore . Do you know , my gynecologist told me I should have a hysterectomy just because I 'm forty-five and I have a little trouble now and then ? ' We 'll just take it out , ' he said . Can you believe it ? " <p> Charlie shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door and have a nice cup of herbal tea , and then go for a good long walk . You probably just pulled a muscle ! An EKG , for goodness sakes . You ca n't trust them . " <p> He thanked her and left the shop . EMG , he thought . He raised his arm quickly and the pain drilled at him : still there . It was comforting in a way . <p> At home , Charlie sat down next to the phone . He missed New York , missed his friends  --  they 'd never think to mention herbal tea without irony . And as for a good long walk , if he 'd been in New York , he 'd have been instructed to get into a cab and go straight home to bed  --  much sounder advice . He longed to call one of his friends in New York , but whom could he call without having to tell about Linda ? Instead , he called his brother 's office in Boston . <p> " Chuck ! " Richard 's voice boomed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Was there one ? Richard seemed to be in one of his increasingly frequent Hail-Fellow-Well-Met moods . " Nothing , " Charlie said . " I was at this doctor 's  --  she gave me this test . " <p> " She ? " <p> " Yeah  --  red hair , green eyes , white coat . " <p> " Uh-oh , " Richard said . " Lust alert . " <p> Who was this person ? This was not the kind of thing Charlie needed to hear . <p> " I take it , " Richard said , " that Linda is still among the missing ? " <p> " You take it right . " <p> " She 'll be back , kid . She will . " <p> " Yeah , " Charlie said . " She just needed some space . " She 'd actually used that word , which had made the whole thing all the worse . " Space . " It was n't how she talked  --  was n't , Charlie told himself , how they talked . <p> " What 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard said . Charlie could hear him moving papers around . " Your arm ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Hmm . You know , I have a theory about your arm . Would you like to hear it ? " <p> " Not really . " <p> " It 's nerves , your arm . Ever think of that ? Nerves , pure and simple . " <p> Charlie waited in vain for Richard 's dumb pun laugh . " It might be a nerve , " he said finally . " Like I was trying to tell you , I had this test . " <p> " And it was negative , right ? Or positive , or whatever , but it did n't show anything , tell me i 'm wrong . Have you never wondered why none of these tests shows anything ? " <p> It was true : he 'd had x-rays and blood tests and even a CT scan . Would Richard have been happier if there were something terrible wrong ? And there was something wrong . " I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Give my love to Kathy and the kids . " <p> " Charlie , Charlie , I 'm sorry . I know it 's a drag having your arm hurt , I do . But at least you have your legs , young friend ! " <p> Charlie laughed : it was something their mother had said to Richard once . <p> " Charlie ? " Richard said . " She will be back . You two are perfect together . You know what Kathy said a couple months ago ? I should n't tell you this . She said she wished you and Linda were around more so the kids could see what a good marriage was all about . So there . " <p> " Well , " Charlie said . " I guess we showed her . " He attempted a laugh . " Is everything O.K. ? " <p> " Yeah , yeah . You know how it is . It 's one day , then it 's the next day . What can you do ? You just go on . " <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could , he made an excuse and got off the phone . You just go on and on and on . <p> He went into the bedroom and pulled open the bottom drawer of his dresser . There , wrapped in a dingy , old plastic bag , was his cervical collar . He put it on and looked in the mirror : the man in the big white doughnut . To hell with neckties  --  he was taking the idea of the turtleneck to new limits . He felt like calling Dr. Price , but what could he say ? Excuse me , but are there any tests to determine whether someone 's really in pain ? Excuse me , but are you busy tonight ? He took a Dolobid and two codeine tablets and got into bed . <p> Peeling shrimp , Linda had said once , was like giving birth  --  no one ever told you how horrifying it was , you had to see for yourself . Charlie was peeling a pound of jumbo and not minding it at all : she had invited herself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just Like a Woman " and allowed himself to hope that she , that tonight . . . But she 'd taken her diaphragm with her , he 'd checked  --  she 'd probably taken it because she 'd known he would check  --  and while Charlie felt in his heart of hearts that a baby was just what they needed , Linda was unlikely to see it that way . <p> For that matter , sex was n't really the issue . <p> What was the issue ? <p> By seven o'clock , everything was set . The shrimp were ready for sauteing , the snow peas and carrots were ready for boiling , the shockingly expensive raspberry tart was hidden in a cabinet , and the wine , on which Charlie had spent most of an afternoon 's pay , was icy cold . <p> By seven-thirty , everything looked a little wilted . <p> At eight , Charlie put on his cervical collar and sat on the edge of the bed . He thought of Dr. Price saying , Go , take pictures with your middle finger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she 'd said to him and be stricken by remorse  --  preferably tonight . And she 'd call him and say , Charlie , I did n't mean it , I want to help you . When the phone rang at eight-thirty , though , it was Linda . <p> " Charlie ? " she said . <p> He held the receiver away from his ear while she recited her apologies  --  something about work , something about Kiro . After a while , he broke in . " Let me guess : you 'll call me soon . Goodbye . " He hung up , and when she did n't call back , he returned to the kitchen and threw away the shrimp and the snow peas and the carrots , forced them into the disposal with a wooden spoon . He took the tart from its hiding place and carefully lifted it out of its box . Holding it with both hands , he leaned over the sink and quickly ate half of it . He was about to have another bite but instead said , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his hands . He could feel the glaze on his cheeks . He started out of the kitchen but immediately turned back and shook pepper over the remains , just in case he changed his mind . <p> In his dream , Linda was about twenty-three , in blue jeans , but neat in blue jeans  --  blue jeans that she 'd ironed . They were new in New York , living in an apartment that was like one they 'd lived in but smaller and darker and dirtier , and she was stacking things : stacks of dishes , stacks of books stacked by subject , stacks of his socks and underwear . He was lying on the naked mattress watching her , and she was babbling , threatening to alphabetize the spices while at the same time relating to him a story about her aunt Marge , the " funny " one  --  and they were happy , happy . <p> And when he woke , she was there , but not in blue jeans . She was sitting upright on a chair by the door , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she called " slacks " and a blouse and blazer  --  looking , Charlie thought , like a woman waiting to be interviewed for a job . He propped himself up on his elbows to get a better look , then sank back onto the bed . " Thanks for knocking , " he said . <p> " I did , " she said eagerly , seeing that he was awake . " Several times . And I rang the doorbell . I guess you 're still a heavy sleeper . " <p> " You were expecting major changes ? It 's only been three weeks . " <p> She came over and sat on the edge of the bed . " I 'm really sorry , " she said . " Really , really sorry . " She touched the cervical collar . " Poor thing . " <p> He ripped open the Velcro fastening and tossed the collar to the floor . <p> " Please , " she said . " Please forgive me . " <p> " O.K. , " Charlie said . " I forgive you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkwardly , on the jaw . " I 'll make us some breakfast , O.K. ? " <p> When he had dressed , he found her stretched out on the living-room rug , balancing in her lap an old accordion file she kept in a small wooden trunk they used as an end table . She was sipping from a cup of coffee , and it was such a familiar sight that Charlie was moderately cheered : perhaps this was simply another phase of their life together . He got coffee for himself and stretched out next to her . <p> " Actually , you do look awfully thin , " she said . " Have you been eating ? " <p> " Mostly sugar in various forms . It gives me a certain clearheadedness . " <p> " And so good for you . " She sipped her coffee . " Did you pour pepper on a tart ? " <p> They laughed , and she leaned over and kissed him again , easily ; then she began looking through the file . <p> " What are you after in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My old address book  --  Kiro wants me to get in touch with Mackenzie about something . " <p> " Oh . " Mackenzie was an old professor of hers  --  it seemed to Charlie that he was n't supposed to ask about what . <p> " Oh , look . " Linda pulled a postcard from the file . " I ca n't believe it  --  remember this ? " She held the card up for him to see : it showed a row of tiny cabins and a big sign that grandly proclaimed KENABSCONSETT INN-LODGE , CABINETTES . " Remember our cabinette ? " <p> " You mean cabinet ? " Charlie said . He remembered : a dank little bathroom , fringed chenille curtains , a bed like a topographical map . Somewhere in Maine . It had poured rain the entire time they were there , and they 'd gone to the " lodge "  --  a little match-box of an office with an easy chair crammed next to a fireplace  --  and bought fifty-two copies of this postcard so he could make them a deck of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King of clubs , " she said . " Remember ? " <p> Charlie took the card . The king of clubs had been the best one : he 'd drawn a cave man wearing an animal skin , a long-armed club over his shoulder . He had n't known she 'd saved it . He looked at her , and it seemed to him that she was n't remembering as much as he was : that it had n't been just any weekend away , but one organized around a particular date , September 25 , 1981 , and a particular purpose : the celebration ? commemoration ? of the fifth anniversary of the first time they 'd slept together , their annual marker back in the days before they had a wedding anniversary to observe . <p> " Remember the lobster rolls ? " she said . <p> He handed her the card and took his coffee cup into the kitchen . He saw the raspberry tart still lying in the sink , and he folded it into the drain . When he looked up , Linda was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.K. ? " she said . <p> " I 'm great . I 'd have to say I 'm really just thriving . " <p> " Charlie .

There was a rule he seemed to be living by : do everything you can to make her want to stay away for good . <p> " Listen , " she said . " Do you want to drive over to Walnut Creek with me today ? I was going to go look at the site , maybe do some sketches . Kiro was there yesterday afternoon , and I think he wanted me to go this weekend . " <p> " I guess , " Charlie said . Kiro , Kiro , Kiro . " What do you mean you think he wanted you to go ? Did he ask you ? " <p> " Kiro is amazing , " she said , shaking her head slowly . " He does n't have to ask for things .

" <p> " Great management technique , " Charlie said . <p> The fog was lifting in the East Bay ; by the time they got to Walnut Creek , the sky was clear , the air warm . In New York , it would have been a treasure of a day , a tantalizing hint of spring , an occasion for buying bunches of tulips for your wife  --  but at least he was with his wife . " God , " he said , " you forget you live in a state where it can be seventy degrees in November . It 's always so damp and cold in the city . " <p> " It 's bracing , " Linda said . " I like it . " <p> She led him up a small rise , to a clearing backed by gray-brown hills . " Brilliant , " she breathed . She turned to Charlie . " He thinks we should design a kind of medical village , which I think is genius now that I 've seen this place , do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the administrative offices , and then behind it , conforming to the line of the hills , an S of cottages attached by covered walkways . And everything connected underground , where the labs would be . " She touched his arm . " What dc , you think ? " <p> Charlie shrugged . " Kiro knows best . " <p> Linda took a sketch pad from her shoulder bag , and he crossed the clearing and began to climb the hill behind it , through low scrub and rocks . When he got to the top , he was winded and sweating lightly ; his elbow ached . He sat on a boulder and looked down at the clearing . Linda looked tiny and serious  --  she looked as if she had nothing to do with him . Look up , he commanded her . But she was absorbed in her sketching . <p> Charlie lowered himself from the boulder onto the ground and lay back . The thing was , he did n't know hove to think of their marriage as troubled ; it had always seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights . He wondered if he could possibly unravel their lives back to the beginning of the trouble , and as he was wondering this another date from their shared past came to him : Halloween 1983 . <p> They were living uptown then , on 113th Street , in one of the nicest apartments they ever had ; Linda was getting her M.Arch . at Columbia . Charlie worked at a camera store on 96th Street , and on his way home each evening , he 'd go up to Avery Hall to see if she was ready for a dinner break . <p> Remembering a jack-o ' - lantern they 'd carved one Halloween in college , Charlie picked up a pumpkin on his way to look for her that afternoon . She was n't in any of her usual places , though , and none of her friends had seen her all day . He walked back down Broadway under a heavy gray sky and decided that he would n't start to worry until he got home and she was n't there . But she was : the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Linda was standing at the sink washing dishes . She barely looked at him when he said hello . He put the pumpkin on a chair and took off his coat , and when he turned around he realized why it all seemed so strange . The table and the counters were covered with dishes ; every dish they owned seemed to be out . He could n't tell whether she had already washed them or was about to . " What are you doing ? " he said . <p> She turned from the sink , her hands gloved with suds , and began to sob . " You do n't care if things are clean , " she cried . " It 's totally up to me . Do you realize we 've never washed our wedding china ? " She waved at a stack of the formal , flowery plates ; he did n't point out that they 'd also never used them . " I do n't mind , " she said . " I like things to be clean . But you just ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turned back to the sink , plunged her hands into the water , and began to sob harder . <p> And here was his mistake . He 'd said , " Realize what ? " He 'd stood behind her without touching her and said , " Realize what ? " And that evening , he asked her again and again , until she finally told him to stop asking , she was fine . That was where they 'd taken their wrong turn : into a place where you could n't tell the difference between polite and happy , to this point , this dry hillside , this separation . When it was so simple , what he should have done : taken her in his arms and said , Darling , darling , please do n't , please forgive me for whatever it is I 've done to upset you , please , you 're my beautiful girl  --  my darling , lovely gehl , like a character in an old movie  --  and they 'd be wonderful now ; they 'd be fine . <p> He found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketches  --  he loved her sketches , had always loved them . " You 're very good at what you do , " he said . <p> Once , she would have said , happily , " Really ? " Now she laughed a little dismissively and said , " So are you "  --  and he wondered what it was she thought he was good at . <p> " Charlie ? " she said . " It 's getting a little crowded at Cynthia 's . " <p> Cautiously , hopefully , he nodded . <p> " She has n't said so , but I think she 'd like her privacy back . " <p> " It 's a small apartment . " <p> " Here 's the thing  --  Kiro 's offered me his carriage house for a few months . " She looked at him , then quickly looked away . <p> " Kiro ? " Charlie said . " This is all about Kiro ? Jesus , Linda  --  too bad I 'm not some fastidious little Japanese architect , is that it ? He probably does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He slammed his fist against the car . " I ca n't believe you . " <p> Charlie had met Kiro once ; he remembered him as a small man in a double-breasted suit  --  a tiny man , really , who smoked tiny black cigarettes and drank a vile drink called a negroni : gin and sweet vermouth and Campari or something . Kiro 's philosophy of life was probably cryptic and pretentious , his carriage house full of smooth black stones and thousand-dollar orchids , no furniture . She could sleep on the stones and eat the orchids , and then they 'd see . <p> " Charlie , listen , " Linda said . " This is n't about sex , I promise . Kiro is just my friend , my very  --  my very kind friend . He 's not the issue . " <p> " What 's the issue , Linda ? " <p> " I just "  --  she hesitated  --  " need some space right now . " <p> That word again . He turned away from her , and because there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched her standing there , pretending to be looking at her sketches , her beautiful sketches . His wife . <p> She gathered her things together and got in next to him . " Would it help , " he said . " Would it help if I got an office job ? You know , where I had to wear a suit and tie every day ? " <p> " Charlie , God . Dress up and play a part ? That 's not how it works . " She sighed and leaned against the door . " You 're wasting yourself . " <p> He started the car . She had never actually said it before , and while a sour little voice in him was saying , " No , I 'm not ; I 'm saving myself , " the rest of him had risen to a strange plateau where he felt oddly empowered  --  he was back on the hill , watching her from a great height . <p> How could a grown man with any self-respect sit in the emergency-room waiting area of a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so much pain , Charlie might have asked himself any number of questions , but as it was , he was concentrating on staying as still as possible . He was n't actually crying so much as tearing up at each involuntary movement of his neck and shoulders , which caused him more anguish than he 'd ever known . At least you have your legs , young friend . It was true : if it had n't been for them , he 'd probably still be at home in bed , destined to a slow and painful death . <p> He 'd woken up in agony that morning  --  the day after helping Linda move her stuff to Kiro 's , so at first he 'd been a bit skeptical : nerves , pure and simple . But he could n't turn his head , could n't move his arms without unbearable pain ; the only way he 'd finally been able to get out of bed was to swing his legs up and then use them as a lever to bring his body upright . Picking up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Dr. Price at the hospital , and she 'd agreed to see him there , and now it turned out that he had something new wrong : a winging scapula . It sounded like a kind of sailboat , but it was his shoulder blade , unleashed from its mooring . <p> " That would definitely be uncomfortable , " Dr Price had said . <p> A winging scapula was also Unusual , and while it was probably a fluke ( a coincidence that half his upper body was malfunctioning ! ) , some possibilities had to be ruled out . In a little while , he was going to go to Radiology for an MRI , and then later he was going to go somewhere else for an EEG . He was making his way through the alphabet . <p> Dr. Price reappeared and sat on the chair next to his . " Radiology is going to squeeze you in just a few more minutes , " she said . <p> " That sounds painful . " <p> She laughed . " After that , I 've arranged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're done there , just come back down to Admitting and they 'll have a bed for you , O.K. ? " <p> " I guess so , " Charlie said . At least maybe they would give him some morphine ; he 'd taken some codeine about an hour before , but it did n't seem to be helping much . <p> " We 'll wait and do the EEG tomorrow , " she said . " You 'll be feeling a lot better by then . " <p> " What exactly are we looking for ? " The word in Charlie 's mind was " tumor . " <p> Dr. Price was silent for a moment . " Nothing we 're going to find , " she said , " how 's that ? I really think it was just moving that new dresser in . " <p> " Right , " Charlie said . " The dresser . " He had n't wanted to tell her what he 'd really been doing yesterday : carrying twelve boxes of art books down three flights of stairs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his shoulder , the way the movers had done in New York . " Still , " he said , " it 's hard to believe this has nothing to do with my arm . What 's really wrong with my arm ? " <p> " It hurts , " she said . <p> Thanks a lot , he thought , but then he turned , painfully , to look at her  --  pretty Dr. Price , whose job it was to know when to say " Do n't worry "  --  and he thought : Well , yes . <p> She glanced at her watch and stood up . " Listen , " she said . " You know who get winging scapulae ? Soldiers , from carrying their guns . So you 're in good company , huh ? " Charlie watched her hurry away , toward people with problems way beyond Unusual . Good company ? he thought . He 'd rather be alone . <p> Slowly , carefully , he got to his feet . He had a quarter in his pocket  --  he 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home  --  and now , walking gingerly to minimize the pain of each step , he started toward a cluster of pay phones . He told himself that what he was about to do was n't so much calling for help as giving information : she would want to know , she had a right to know  --  she was his wife . And this time , Charlie had some hard information : he 'd already known what an EEG was , and he 'd asked and discovered exactly what an MRI was . It was Magnetic Resonance Imaging  --  formerly , Dr. Price had confided , Nuclear Magnetic Resonance , NMR , but they 'd changed the name because people did n't like the word " nuclear . " It was like a CT scan , that big washing machine , except they could look at any part of you and it was n't invasive . Charlie was all for non-invasive . <p> He reached the phones . She would say : " Charlie , oh my God , no . " Or maybe : " Oh , Charlie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the MRI , with flowers and magazines because she was a great believer in brightening a sick room . A sick room  --  that was another of those terms of hers . It used to be that if he had so much as a cold she 'd turn into Cherry Ames , girl nurse  --  bring him milk shakes and toast , because that 's what her mother had brought her when she was sick . Chocolate milk shakes , so thick you had to eat them with a spoon . <p> Charlie inched his hand into his pocket , and a shiver of pain raced through his neck and shoulder . He knew that lifting his arm to dial would be even worse . And for what ? An hour or two . Maybe a day or two . He pulled his empty hand from his pocket . What was that old joke ? " Doctor , doctor , it hurts to dial the phone . " " So do n't dial it ! " <p> If a CT scanner was like a washing machine , an MRI machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off " everything , " including his wedding ring , and was standing in a paper gown watching the technician prepare the little stretcher he would lie on . And then the stretcher would slide into the machine . . . <p> " Got all your jewelry off ? " the technician said . <p> " Yeah , " Charlie said , " I left my diamonds in my jeans pocket . " <p> The technician was about Charlie 's age , friendly . He laughed . " Metal 's the problem , " he said . " You know those covered elastic bands women wear in their hair ? With a little piece of metal at the joint ? I had a woman wearing one of those , and when she came out , her ponytail was on the other side of her head . " <p> Oops . " I guess it 's a good thing I do n't have any metal staples in my body , " Charlie said . <p> " Good in any case , " said the technician . " Ready ? " <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , he actually felt better . The technician put a wedge under Charlie 's knees and then enclosed his head in what Charlie could only think of as a cage . <p> " The idea , " the technician said , " is not to move . It 'll take about half an hour . I can take you out at any time , but then we 'll have to start over . It 'll sound like this . " He moved out of Charlie 's line of vision and knocked on the side of the machine . <p> " But what will I feel ? " Charlie said . <p> " Nothing , " the technician said . " You 'll feel nothing . " <p> He slid Charlie in , and Charlie thought it was a good thing he was n't claustrophobic : he was lying in a dark tube just wide enough to contain him , his head in a cage , forbidden to move . <p> " Everything O.K. ? " the technician asked . There was a little light down past Charlie 's feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " Charlie said . " I guess . " <p> " I 'll be going into the control room now , " the technician said , " but I 'll be able to hear you in there , O.K. ? " <p> Charlie swallowed . Maybe he was claustrophobic . There was no reason for this to be any different from lying in bed , but it was . He tried closing his eyes , but he started to spin and had to open them again . Relax , he told himself . If only he had a mantra . He could choose one right now  --  field , maybe , or stream , those were peaceful words  --  but how relaxing could it be to say field over and over again , field , field , he feeled really silly with a mantra ! <p> It was cold in the machine , but he could feel sweat trickling down his sides , collecting on his forehead , his upper lip . If he had a tumor it would appear as a blotch on the technician 's monitor  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumor . . . <p> But he knew he did n't . If he did he 'd he having dizzy spells , vomiting : he 'd be sick . He would have to put his affairs in order , and he did n't have affairs , he had  --  a sore arm . The way other people had a hobby . Or a career . Or a marriage . <p> The noise started . From inside the machine , it sounded sort of like the clanking of a radiator , but more , Charlie decided , like someone hitting the lid of a garbage can with a hammer , over and over again , arrhythmically . It was actually kind of soothing , in the way bad avant-garde music could sometimes be soothing , and it made Charlie think of his and Linda 's last night in New York . They 'd been taken out for drinks by their friends Ira and Jean-nine , music lovers who chose a little place in TriBeCa where a group called Eponymous was playing : three white guys with dreadlocks and sunglasses , one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole battery of weapons , including a hammer and a washboard . Linda was so tense that night  --  she kept looking at her watch , and kicking Charlie under the table every time Ira ordered another round of drinks  --  but Charlie had liked it , all of it , even the terrible band . Eponymous  --  where but in New York could you find a band like Eponymous , a band called Eponymous ? He wondered what had become of them . He thought that as soon as he got out of here  --  this tube , this hospital-he would call Ira ; Ira would know . He had n't talked to Ira in almost two months , probably the longest they 'd ever gone without talking since they first met . And Charlie liked Ira  --  loved him . And Jeannine , too , and their apartment with all of that overstuffed plush furniture from Ira 's grandmother 's place . Maybe he would n't call , he 'd just show up at their door with a six of beer and some weird record he 'd buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't ask him any questions , they were n't like that , but they 'd know , just as Charlie did , what the issue was : it was I-don't-love-you-anymore , and Charlie knew he 'd known that for a long time . <p> Saving himself ? Why talk of saving himself when he could spend himself ?
