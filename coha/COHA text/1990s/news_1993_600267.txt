<p> Michigan 's Fab Five stepped into history Monday night . Thrust themselves directly into NCAA tournament lore . <p> But hardly as expected . <p> A two-point game . Clock ticking down . A called timeout by the fabbest of the Five , center Chris Webber . . . only the Wolverines had no more timeouts to take . <p> It brought a brief huddle by the officials , then the inevitable : a technical foul . And it brought a 77-71 loss in the tournament final , Webber 's and Michigan 's second in the championship game in as many years . <p> " In the heat of the moment , strange things happen , " Michigan coach Steve Fisher said . <p> This one will go down among the strangest , most talked-about , most-dissected in Final Four history . <p> How ironic is it that Webber 's ill-fated call was made against North Carolina ? That it happened at the north end of the New Orleans Superdome , the same side of the floor where Georgetown 's Fred Brown fed an ill-fated pass to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misplay sealed North Carolina 's previous championship . <p> " I do n't want to say that 's another fluke , " Carolina coach Dean Smith said . <p> A fluke play ? Perhaps . A fluke victory , a fluke title , it was not . <p> " It 's all part of the game , " Smith said . " We had plays earlier in the game that were pretty ironic - a guy falling down makes a basket . ( But ) I 've often said you have to be lucky and good . " <p> North Carolina , the steadiest , most solid team in the country in the regular season , was steady and solid when it needed to be . Down 10 points midway through the first half , the Tar Heels stormed back to lead at the half . Down four again with less than four minutes to play , they scored 14 of the game 's final 18 points . <p> Kentucky 's three-point shooters found nary a seam against Michigan 's perimeter defense in Saturday 's semifinals . North Carolina 's Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial treys . <p> Webber might have heard instructions from teammates on the Wolverines ' bench when he signaled for inal non-timeout . But he did it in a near-panic , as two Carolina defenders were ruthlessly trapping him in the corner . <p> " We had Webber covered pretty well , " Smith said . <p> " We had a chance , " said Michigan 's Fisher . " We did n't get it done . " <p> The Fab Five came that close - 20 seconds and another couple of points - to winning an historic championship as mere sophomores . Fisher came that close to claiming his second title in only four-plus seasons as head coach . <p> The Tar Heels ' Smith came that close to another close-but-no-cigar finish . <p> When the game ended , and he had won , he fairly bounded to midcourt to shake Fisher 's hand . Then , he was wrapped up hugs from his players and assistants . <p> Smith had waited 11 years for his second championship . And had waited far longer for the acclaim that should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not named Rupp . <p> Monday 's victory was his 774th in 32 seasons . Smith now trails Adolph Rupp , the late Kentucky legend , by 102 - or about four average Carolina seasons ' worth . He won a school-record 33 of them this season , along with the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season title , but was n't to be found among the 10 finalists in the Associated Press ' coach-of-the-year balloting . <p> The number everybody seemed to care about more : one , the total of national championships he 'd won . Until Monday . <p> Smith has shrugged it off . His associates have not . <p> " Sometimes , when you 're so good for such a long period of time , people tend to take you for granted , " said former Carolina assistant and current Kansas head coach Roy Williams , whom Smith defeated in Saturday 's semifinals . " I think the national public takes him for granted . Sometimes , I think he 's even taken for granted in his own state . <p> " Getting your team to a top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level and then maintaining it for such a long period of time is by far the most difficult thing in the world to do . And yet , he 's done that for 32 years . " <p> How ? <p> " His philosophy is very sound , " Williams said . " And he 's able to get youngsters to understand that philosophy and be willing to play to their maximum under that philosophy . <p> " It 's not only communications skills , but knowing which buttons to push to challenge people . You can tell me to do something , and I may know how to do it , but how badly do I want to ? " <p> Whatever buttons Smith pushed against Michigan , they were the right ones . <p> North Carolina shot 61.9% in the decisive second half . In their biggest , most pressurized game of the season , against their most athletic opponent , the Tar Heels committed only 10 turnovers . <p> They held Michigan scoreless for almost 3 1/2 minutes in which the game turned near the end , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' slam with one minute left . Michigan pulled back within one , but no closer . <p> Thus , the credentials of a most-heralded recruiting class were solidified . Not those of the more glamorous Fab Five , but Carolina 's incoming class of 1990 : Montross , point guard Derrick Phelps and swingman Brian Reese , now all juniors . <p> Smith could n't keep the class intact - center Clifford Rozier transferred to Louisville - but it turns out he did n't need to . <p> The 7-foot Montross finished with 16 points against Michigan , Reese with eight points and three assists , Phelps - playing with a painful hip bruise - with nine points , six assists and three steals . <p> They 've come a long way from their baptism in 1990 , when Smith - wincing at the attention being heaped upon a group of unproven freshmen - sent them onto the court against the Tar Heels ' veterans . It was in the middle of a coaches ' clinic . <p> " We had 1,000 coaches there , we had officials from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith recalled . " They lost by 46 . I exaggerated by calling it a 92-point defeat ( doubling the spread to account for the unplayed second half ) . I think we got their attention . " <p> That class , and Monday 's victory and championship , arrived at an opportune time . For all of Smith 's and the Tar Heels ' steady success , they were being overlooked . The center of the college basketball universe had settled in recent years in North Carolina , but eight miles away in Durham . <p> At Duke . <p> Two championships and six Final Four appearances in seven years cast a considerable shadow . But the Heels have climbed out . <p> " Duke came along and sort of pushed us to the side , " senior George Lynch said . " That was helpful to us . It definitely helped propel us to this point . " <p> That , and Webber 's historic technical .
