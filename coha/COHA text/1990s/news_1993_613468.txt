<p> San Francisco - The night before Gian Luigi Ferri 's murderous rampage at 101 California St. , drive-by shooters , in a far less publicized incident in North Oakland , wounded a 13-year-old boy in the left arm and upper chest ; a 15-year-old girl in the back and leg ; two more 16-year-old boys , one in the foot and leg , another in the shoulder ; and a 19-year-old woman in the stomach and knee while she was shielding her 19-month-old child . <p> Why , asked an Oakland Tribune editorial about both incidents , was " there not some mechanism in the minds of those people that told them what they were doing was wrong ? " <p> The same question could , and should , be asked of the other mass shootings that seem to be occurring with increasing regularity : In homes , where the about-to-be-divorced husband kills his wife and kids ; at post offices , where disgruntled ex-employees blow away as many of their former workmates as possible ; in schoolyards , where " deranged " loners massacre children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where in the name of Allah , followers of a blind Egyptian sheikh blow up unsuspecting Western infidels going about their daily business . <p> Common to all these cases , of course , is the insane availability of automatic guns and other weapons of war . More than 130,000 people were killed by guns in the United States in the past six years , the victims - despite what the National Rifle Association tells you - not just of criminals , but of firearms . <p> But are there not other cultural themes at play in these horrific exercises ? Increasingly , mass murder seems to be the last refuge of the self-styled " victim " - the victim of assembly-line speedups and remote bureaucracies ; of Western colonialism ; of gouging lawyers and disrespectful cops ; or , in the case of Gian Luigi Ferri , of failed American dreams . <p> The shooters seem not unlike the Michael Douglas character in the movie " Falling Down , " in which a laid-off defense worker gets caught in a traffic jam , snaps and proceeds to wreak havoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievances of the shooter , real and imagined , were assiduously explored by the media . The character wound up on the real- life cover of Newsweek , a symbol of 1990s white male rage , and now the social condition is named the " Falling Down Syndrome . " <p> Was fame - his desire to tell his story on " Oprah " and " Donahue " - the spur for Gian Luigi Ferri ? " Like terrorism , the quest for an audience is a constituent part of these crimes , " says Jay Rosen , a media analyst and professor of journalism at New York University . " The media is the public stage in this country ; if you do n't make it there , you almost do n't exist . " <p> Movies may be equally influential . <p> " There 's a leitmotif that runs through Hollywood movies , a Rambo mentality , that says the system is big and dumb and wrong , and that the hero has to transcend it , " notes Troy Duster , director of the Berkeley- based Institute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and cheer while he takes everyone out , like Clint Eastwood when he went after the bad and the ugly , and Charles Bronson when he took out the baddies in ' Death Wish . ' Then we cheered Bernhard Goetz for taking out some street punks in a New York subway - at least for a while . Now , someone 's taking out the baddies on the 33rd floor of a downtown law office . " <p> " My sense is that Ferri was another cowboy who 'd been trod upon , and he was gon na get back at them , " says Claude Fischer , a professor of sociology at University of California-Berkeley . " In another society , he might have gone to the padrone with his problems . " <p> Asserting one 's own being by extinguishing others is hardly unique to the United States . But experts see specifically American roots for its astoundingly high incidence here . <p> " You ca n't just ascribe this to mental illness , " says Anne Swidler , co-author with Robert Bellah of " Habits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the world , but they do n't do what Americans do . " In Ms. Swidler 's view , these violent outbursts emanate from our near-obsession with individual dignity and rights , in place of protective links to neighborhoods or other groups . <p> " If someone does something wrong to you , even in the most ordinary transactions , it becomes an identity-threatening event , " says Ms. Swidler . " Such responses would be deemed extraordinary in most other cultures . " <p> With the Ferri bloodbath and the growing number of courtroom shootings around the country , the armed man with a grievance has invaded the realm of the law - which , says Franklin Zimring , director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at UC-Berkeley , was meant to substitute for the gunslinging ethos of earlier times . <p> Whether Ferri is a symbol of particularly stressful urban times is a highly debatable point among expert observers . In earlier periods of social stress , those who were " falling down " generally took it out on themselves , rather than on others , notes San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' 30s , people hopped off bridges , stepped in front of trains . " <p> In fact , homicide rates did go up in the early years of the Great Depression , but declined during the later years , according to UCLA urban historian Eric Monkkonen . <p> But Dr. Monkkonen and others caution against visions of a more sylvan past . Eye-gouging contests and random slayings of drifters and domestic murder-suicides were very much the order of the day in pre-20th century America . <p> Still , there are significant differences . Times used to be tough for almost everybody ; you worked until you died . There was little sense of security or predictability or entitlement - except for the very rich . Most Americans were perhaps better prepared then for things to go wrong . <p> Are we making too much out of Ferri 's aberrant act ? David Rosenhan , a professor of law and psychology at Stanford University believes the way the media highlight these mass murders may cause unfounded fears about public safety . " These incidents are a very rare occurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are caused by a minuscule number of people , " Dr. Rosenhan says . <p> Yet one ca n't help but wonder about the toxic cultural atmosphere we breathe , and to what extent it helps trigger those who are predisposed to " snap . " The tabloid TV shows , like " Hard Copy " and " Inside Edition , " and Maury and Geraldo and Sally Jesse - all with their bottomless appetites for the deviant ; the " legitimate " TV news shows that are driven by the " If it bleeds , it leads " mentality ; the mail-order books like " 21 Techniques of Silent Killing " and " Kill Without Joy , " which have made their Colorado-based publisher an absolute fortune - under the guise of the First Amendment , of course ; the gangsta rap that extols the abuse and murder of " bitches " and " hoes " and " pigs " ; the video games produced by industry giant Sega , like " Night Trap , " which depicts bloody attacks on young women . The moral numbness of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what they are doing is wrong . " <p> A.S . Ross writes for the San Francisco Examiner.
