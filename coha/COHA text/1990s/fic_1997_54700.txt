" The clouds above Angola that day hung thick with rain and electricity , piled in columns that stretched into the sky like entrails . Hah ! Clouds like entrails . I know what you call me  --  Blas , the poetic butcher . But that 's what they looked like , all purple and red and wet . You 'll never see such a sky above Cuba , Felix , I promise . <p> " We smelled like dogs after they 've been swimming . Mud finds its way everywhere during the wet season , in our scalp , our teeth , our underpants , everything gritty and damp and covered with mildew . Fungus grew between my toes and in my crotch . <p> " We were driving past a small village when we ran over a land mine with our BTR-152  --  that 's an armored transporter , Soviet-made , mierda , of course . The noise from a land mine is not so bad , but the shock went through the iron plating beneath us , up the bench seats and into our asses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephew . This is more than you would like to know . <p> " Our driver lost control , drove into a tree . Bees poured from the broken trunk like smoke , stinging us on our faces and through our uniforms , swarming after us as we ran away from the vehicle . Ay , ay , ay , African bees are angry , especially in the middle of the day . I think the electricity from the clouds makes bees even more irate . It made us all a little crazy that day . " <p> The Four Roads farmers ' market in Havana was quiet as the sellers set up their kiosks beneath the peristyle : cabbages , potatoes , cassava , and plantains on display , green peppers , cucumbers , carrots , boniatos , and pineapples stowed out of sight to be sold for black-market dollars . The hot air smelled of freshly dug dirt , sour vegetation , and blood . <p> Uncle Blas lightly oiled his whetstone and drew his knife across it in fluid strokes , producing a tearing sound that set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was immune to the effect . <p> " You think I 'm superstitious , Felix , " Uncle Blas continued . " You ca n't measure the effect of cloud electricity on the behavior of bees and soldiers , so you conclude there is no relation . " He struck the dull side of the blade against the whetstone , and sparks shot out . " A thing does n't exist without your statistics . " <p> Uncle Bias sprinkled sawdust on the ground beneath the butcher block to absorb the blood from the coming day . He was fifty , a veteran of Playa Giron , where he fought mercenaries in the jungle surrounding the Bay of Pigs . Our generation grew up with tales of how Uncle Blas and his companeros repelled the invasion . Nearly twenty years later , the army recalled Uncle Blas to fight in the Angolan civil war . From there he brought back an entirely different set of stories . <p> " Are you going to wear your bulldog face all morning , Felix ? You should be more like your wife . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once Uncle Blas began a story he could not let it go . It was like watching a bandy-legged terrier shake the life out of a rat . <p> " Yes , we were in the meat grinder . Columns of South African armor had crossed the border into Angola , and we needed to get out of their way . But the land mine tore a wheel on our BTR  --  solid rubber , turned to sausage-and how could we reach the spare with all those bees ? Soldiers must be mechanics these days . At Playa Giron we fought on foot . <p> " The people of the village were bushmen , small , brown-skinned people . They appeared friendly enough , but who can say ? Many bushmen fight for the South Africans . " Uncle Bias closed his eyes so he could see it better . <p> " Just when you think things ca n't get any worse , a naked man runs toward us . He 's too dark to be a bushman , blacker even than me . Deserters from all sides hide in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he carries a crazy old automatic rifle as big and heavy as my cock , I swear to Christ , it was enormous . Come on , Felix , that 's worth a little smile . Do n't let yourself get so depressed , hey ? " Uncle Bias shrugged his shoulders . " Suit yourself . " <p> " So the naked man shoots while he runs at us ; we do n't know why . Perhaps we 'd interrupted his lovemaking , eh ? He waves the rifle as he fires , shaking out bullets like a priest with holy water , yes , just like a priest . A black private from Santiago-what am I saying ? We are all black in Angola , except for the officers . Our lighter-skinned comrades stay in Cuba to protect the homeland . Hah ! Anyway , this private hugs himself on the ground , his stomach punctured by one of the old man 's bullets , a lucky shot from that distance . <p> " This is the most painful of wounds , worse than a shattered kneecap or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eats at your insides , keeps the hole from healing . No one liked this private , but still he was one of ours . His cries were pitiful . <p> " Then "  --  Uncle Blas drew deeply on his cigar , tilted his head back , and exhaled extravagantly , creating a miniature storm cloud above his head  --  " the sky breaks . Rain shines like slivers of broken glass in the headlamps of our disabled BTR . Thunder deafens us , and the lightning moves toward us over the savannah . " He smiled at the smoke , pleased with the effect . <p> Uncle Blas wore a sharply angled black beret and dungarees with cuffs rolled above his army boots . He was shirtless and hirsute , muscles thick and corded , his black skin stretched taut over an enormous goat belly . Uncle Blas kept his beard neatly trimmed , his upper lip shaved . <p> " The naked man still runs at us , weeping tears of anger , his rifle empty now . I notice several smashed clay pots by the broken tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is also a tin can with holes punched in it . I 've seen beekeepers collect honey like this on television , blowing smoke at the bees "  --  Uncle Blas exhaled mightily , shooting a stream of cigar smoke at an imaginary hive  --  " in order to make them docile during the harvest . I realize that the man running toward us is a beekeeper , and we 've ruined his living . <p> " The force of our bullets matches that of the beekeeper 's momentum , and he dances lifelessly in place before us . Ay , ay . " Uncle Blas squatted beside a shoulder of pork marbled with fat . He wrapped his arms around the meat and stood , hugging it to his chest in a dancer 's embrace . " Please do n't sit on my cutting block , Felix . If you 're going to sulk all day , stay out of my way . " <p> Uncle Blas hefted the pork shoulder onto the block . It made a wet , slapping noise against the wood . " I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must act . That 's why you would make a terrible soldier , Felix . You ca n't second-guess yourself later . " Uncle Bias punched the meat with his enormous fists . " It helps to tenderize it . " <p> The peristyle offered no protection from the morning sun , and Uncle Bias squinted into the glare as he continued his story . " The people from the village stare at us quietly . We stare back at them over the barrels of our rifles . A woman carries a child slung across her back in a kaross . She wears a New York Yankees baseball cap , and it reminds me of watching Luis Tiant and the Red Sox play the Yankees on television-these are the things you think about when you 're scared . Each moment brought with it an awareness that the South Africans were getting closer . Our noses and lips and cheeks and eyelids swell from the stings . We look like spoiled infants . <p> " We hear a loud bang and open fire on the village , the daub and wattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing , it is easier to continue than to stop . Some of us throw grenades . " <p> Bias spat in the sawdust . " Maybe it was the electricity in the clouds . I do n't know . " He wrapped an apron around his belly . " Our driver had left the BTR 's engine running in his haste to get away from the bees , and it backfired . That was the loud bang that scared us . Water in the fuel . It ca n't be helped during the wet season . " <p> An ancient Vespa motor scooter sputtered past , and Uncle Blas winced , half-expecting it to backfire . " Under different circumstances we might have acted heroically . There 's nothing more to tell , " he said . He stubbed out his cigar . <p> " You ca n't watch a war film after seeing something like that . Not because it brings back bad memories . It 's because the dead people are so phony in the movies , a bunch of people pretending . If I were in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the slaughterhouse in Matanzas where I get my meat and scrape up the bits of flesh before they hose down the concrete floor . I 'd scatter these around the set . Then I 'd mold bodies out of gray clay from across the harbor . That way the corpses would be heavy , and the skin lifeless , and you could mold their features into terrible contortions , twisting the limbs at crazy angles for the cameras . People killed violently look as though they 've never been alive . I 've said too much already . You 'll see for yourself soon enough , nephew . " <p> Uncle Bias leaned into the meat , pushing his knife through the grain , cutting away eight-ounce chunks to be rationed to cardholders . His black skin glistened with sweat . " Ay , muchacho , killing a village is easy . It 's disposing of the bodies that takes work . Lions might gnaw on them for a little while  --  lions are the vermin of Africa . They gorge themselves on a kill , then come back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never return . People taste terrible and are hard to digest . " <p> Uncle Bias spoke faster , trying to end a story that had gone too long . " It 's not a good idea to let corpses rot on the ground because of diseases and flies , not to mention the stench . Dead bodies smell like unwashed old people , only more so . One or two you can bury , but a whole village  --  you 're going to need some bulldozers . The electricity kept us from thinking clearly . We decided to leave the bodies for the South Africans to bury , but we felt bad about it . It 's unprofessional . I 'm sorry , Felix . I 'm upsetting you more . This is where the story dies . " <p> Uncle Blas mopped his brow with his beret . He lifted the cushion from his bench seat and removed two steaks , lean and freshly cut , from their hiding place . " Here , Felix , " he said , wrapping them in paper . " Take these home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . " <p> " Thank you , Uncle . " Speaking was an effort . An hour earlier , I had stood in the shadow of the Ministry of Information , a Soviet-built monolith , holding a box filled with the contents of my desk : a framed photograph of Magda modeling a pair of her hideous plastic earrings ; a coffee mug from Granma , the official newspaper ; a " Felix Guzman " nameplate ; a coffee-stained coaster ; a calculator ; a Polish-made yo-yo ; and a roll of toilet paper . <p> Uncle Blas , the poetic butcher , had told the story to prepare me for Africa . As a black , unemployed statistician , I would soon be swept up in Cuba 's expeditionary force in Angola . <p> " I liked your old war stories better , " I said . <p> Uncle Blas shrugged . " Me too , nephew . In that time the revolution was new , and we still fought for the people . " <p> I took the meat and , leaving my uncle to his butchery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes , banana liquor , three-liter cans of tomato paste , bags of sugar , vanilla , galletas , boxes of matches , and Russian salad pickled in vinegar . The farmers leaned back in their chairs , refusing to sell until they 'd finished reading their morning newspapers . <p> I waited to meet Magda for lunch beneath a thirty-foot-tall Che Guevara who led other bearded revolutionaries forward , off the billboard . Magda worked as a reader at the Corona cigar factory  --  two morning shifts at the microphone reading official news from Granma about the fighting in Angola , two more in the afternoon with a mystery or romance novel  --  while rows of torcedores listened with blank expressions , two to a workbench with their hot chocolate and pots of rice glue , wielding chavetas to cut and smooth the wrapping leaves and tamp the filler into tightly wound cigars . <p> Magda 's lunch hour started at noon , and I passed the time by making my yo-yo sleep , walk the dog , circle the world . It kept my mind from Angola for moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my desk in a box under one arm . My free hand clutched Uncle Blas 's gift . Blood from the steaks leaked through the paper , making my fingers sticky , and ! wondered how long it would take for the army to learn of my employment status . I tried to calculate the chances of survival in Angola , but there were too many variables , and my only data came from Uncle Blas 's stories . <p> Magda picked me up in her Montuno , a rumbling little car assembled in Cuba . It was painted the same bright red of her lipstick and earrings . Magda retouched any scratches and dings with her nail polish , a perfect match . She drove onto the sidewalk , and I climbed in . I was glad to see she had not invited Gregorio along . Gregorio worked with Magda at the factory , an old man who still lived in the time before the revolution  --  his time , he called it . <p> Uncle Bias and Gregorio often told each other stories on the balcony of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the lull that signaled the end of the other 's turn so that his could begin . The previous evening Gregorio had launched once again into his tale about the beautiful German lithographer with whom he fell in love when she came to create designs for the cigar factory 's boxes  --  " In my time , they used gold in the gilt "  --  while my uncle searched for enemy aircraft in the sliver of sky that showed between the tall houses lining the narrow street , waiting politely for Gregorio 's lithographer to return to her homeland , at which time Uncle Blas would wet his throat with claro , unlabeled beer , as he prepared to revisit one of his battles . <p> " What 's in the box , Felix ? " Magda asked , leaning across to the passenger seat . I do n't drive . My mind is usually too occupied with calculations to pay attention to the road . <p> The car leapt forward before we finished kissing , and the Montuno 's horn announced our presence in traffic . I gripped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel swam among the Ladas , Fiats , and scooters . Art deco buildings with dead neon and weedy parking lots flanked the wide road . Magda drove with her seat pulled back , one brown arm stretching to the steering wheel . <p> The light over the rearview mirror flickered as the cat 's doors rattled against its undercarriage . Magda had reupholstered the seats with canvas dyed in zebra stripes , had sanded away all signs of rust and filled any holes with body putty until the car was nearly watertight . <p> I placed the box on the floorboard between my feet and held up the meat . " Steaks , from my uncle . " <p> " Aieyee ! Bless Blas ! " She beat on the horn . The driver behind us echoed our Montuno 's harelip beep with the operatic blare of a 1957 Olds Rocket 88 . Magda laughed with her entire face , cheekbones lifting , eyes crinkled , red lips pulled back to reveal small , even teeth . I waited until she found a parking space before telling her I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked , and I nodded . <p> For the past three years , Cuban meteorologists had been seeding storm clouds with silver iodide dissolved in acetone , to increase rainfall over Angola during the dry season  --  part of a plan to bring socialist prosperity to Africa . I 'd been assigned to complete a statistical analysis to validate the scheme . My figures would be released to the Bureau of Communications , which would publish them beneath the red masthead of Granma . Then they would be read by Magda to her cigar rollers . <p> " Do the best you can with what we have , " the ministry jefe had said sympathetically when I objected . <p> " But I need data collected from a control area that was not seeded , and precipitation figures for both areas for at least ten years prior to the project , " I told the jefe . How could I generate accurate figures without a control area ? I tethered the yo-yo to my middle finger . There 's a mindless pleasure in playing with a yo-yo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hummed above my head , charging the air with electricity . I let the yo-yo drop from my upturned palm , turned my hand over , and flexed my fingers . The yo-yo returned . <p> " Please put away that ridiculous toy , Guzman . Make the figures come out to 17 1/2 percent more rain with cloud seeding . " The ministry jefe smiled . " Nobody argues with exact numbers . " <p> The desk fan oscillated noisily . Inside the overhead fluorescent , free electrons collided with atoms of mercury vapor , showering us with white light and making the hairs on my neck and arms crawl . I shot the yo-yo forward until it stopped , inches from the jefe 's face . <p> " Randomization is the basis for an unbiased estimation ! " I said hotly . It had sounded like one of Fidel 's revolutionary maxims . <p> Magda and I stood in adjacent queues in the pizza cafe , waiting for stools to open at the counter . There was a separate line for each of the two hundred stools . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just make something up ? " Magda asked . <p> " One of your cigar rollers could make up some numbers , but it would be a lie . I studied for five years to become a statistician . It is the methodology of truth ! " Again I was sounding like a billboard slogan . <p> Magda reached across and took my hand . " Well , I 'm proud of you for refusing . Normally you would have played with your yo-yo and calculated the consequences . You did n't think  --  you acted . " <p> " That 's how Uncle Bias killed the village . " <p> " Yow ! He told that awful story again ? " <p> I nodded . " It gets worse with each telling . This time the clouds were like entrails . " <p> Magda stifled a giggle out of respect for my depression , and we stood in silence until stools became available . A waitress walked down the counter taking orders : " Pizza or spaghetti ? " <p> We both asked for pizza with cheese and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What will you do now , Felix ? " Magda asked . <p> I shrugged . " Angola . " <p> The tomato sauce was too sweet , and the cheese had marbled . People stared at my back , waiting for my stool . We surrendered our places at the counter without finishing our pizza . Nobody does . <p> I left Magda at the car , deciding to walk the long way home along the Malecon . A salt mist blew across the highway from the ocean and left a film on the shop windows . I looked into one , hoping to buy something for Magda . It was empty , save for a mannequin torso wearing a wired brassiere , and some packages of Sputnik razor blades . <p> Next door a pair of laborers in coverails hunched over the counter in a Category VII bar , the worst , drinking clear alcohol . Scrawlings covered the walls , so many that they were illegible and people had started digging into the stucco with keys , carving clean white letters in a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estudio , Trabajo , Fusil . Study , Work , the Rifle . <p> I crossed the highway to sit on the seawall . There I indulged in a morbid fantasy in which I threw myself into the surf and allowed the waves to pound me against the barnacle-encrusted stone blocks below that served as a breakwater . I soon grew bored and went home . <p> The salt air eats away at the houses of old Havana , and the baroque and neoclassical facades crumble into the streets . The narrow , one-way lanes had been designed to offer shade to the two old men playing dominoes on a folding table outside a bodega on Calle Cuartlesand , where Magda and I lived . Magda had illegally parked the Montuno on the sidewalk below our tiny balcony so she could watch it . <p> I cut the steaks into strips to cook Brazilian style , using bricks heated in the oven . We leaned against the balcony 's pitted ironwork and ate each morsel the moment it browned . Magda popped a forkful of steak between her red lips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back to highlight a shapely neck . She trimmed her own hair on the first Saturday of each month , naked in front of the hall mirror with scissors and a hand-held mirror , curls floating down around her red toenails . Everything about Magda was beautiful , except for the plastic earrings she made from melted toothbrushes . <p> Magda tossed a piece of steak across the street to the boy on the balcony facing us , and he caught it one-handed . He still wore his school uniform and the blue-and-white scarf of Los Pioneros . A factory worker and her husband played canasta on the balcony below . Weeds had sprouted in the exposed stonework . Beneath them , at street level , two young women  --  members of the neighborhood Committee for the Defense of the Revolution  --  touched up decades-old anti-Batista graffiti . <p> We ate more slowly as the bricks cooled and we grew slightly drunk on vino quinado . A breeze carried the scent of mint from Magda 's window box . Whenever the box yielded enough mint to fill two cocktail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring rum and lemon over the leaves . <p> " Tell me again . What did he say when he fired you ? " <p> I gestured imperiously with my hand , like I was waving off a fly . " Go away , " I said in my nasal imitation of the ministry jefe . <p> Magda let out another peal of laughter , and the sweet , red wine dribbled down her chin . <p> " I 'll have to learn to mimic my sergeant when I go to Angola , " I said sourly . <p> Lead pipes clanged and rumbled , telling us that the water was running again . A speedbird flew toward the patch of sky between the buildings . A man wearing a box jacket walked briskly toward our house to meet the girl in the apartment above us . Magda produced a cedar box containing a dozen huge cigars . The top bore a lithograph of a beautiful woman  --  held aloft by cherubim  --  waving farewell . The colors were still brilliant , and the gilt had retained its luster , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains of Cuba . <p> " I quit my job this afternoon , " she said , offhandedly . " The cigars are a going-away present from Gregorio . " Old Gregorio had been a torcedor while Fidel was still playing baseball . Before the revolution , he grew famous for his cigar-making skill , and the Havana factories competed for his artistry . His stiff fingers could no longer fill the everrising quotas , and now he worked as a selector , separating the leaves by color . <p> " You quit ? Why ? " <p> Magda ignored my question . " These cigars are made according to the specifications of those sold exclusively to Winston Churchill . It was once Gregorio 's sole job at the factory to make them . The wrapper leaves are the most delicate in Cuba , grown in San Juan y Martinez beneath cheesecloth and wound tightly around filler tobacco . Gregorio steals only claro leaves , a few each day from the pile on his lap as he separates . He rolls the cigars at home . Look at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were a piece of the true cross . " No one has constructed such a cigar since Churchill died . " <p> Magda and I each lit one of the Winston Churchill cigars . Their aroma commingled with the smell of sewers , and fried pork , and mint , and coffee laced with chicory , and old shoes set out in doorways for shining , and all the other scents of Old Havana . A good cigar can make your head float . <p> I went into the apartment and put on a pair of rubber shower shoes , so I would n't get shocked by our aged Frigidaire , and returned to the balcony with handfuls of ice cubes for our wine . A puff of smoke drifted languidly away from Magda . The cigars came from Gregorio 's time , and they burned evenly and well . <p> " Every morning I read about Angola to the torcedores while they roll cigars , " Magda said , " and in my mind I hear Uncle Blas 's voice as he tells one of his war stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . You would be hopeless as a soldier , Felix , no good to anyone in Angola . You 're coming to America with me and my Montuno . " <p> I looked down at the canvas tarp that covered Magda 's little car , protecting it from falling masonry . " The Montuno ? " <p> Magda nodded . " We leave tomorrow . Light up another cigar . We wo n't be able to take them with us . " <p> I smoked the second cigar in silence , my head light from the tobacco and the speed of events . <p> " You 're calculating again , " Magda said through a veil of smoke . The cooking bricks had grown cold . " The time for numbers is over . " <p> We took the Malecon east through the tunnel under the harbor . Magda figured we 'd have a better chance of catching the current to the Florida Keys if we left from the tip of the peninsula , at Varadero . It was as close as we could get to America . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as the harbor tunnel swallowed the Montuno . I 'd been an habanero all my life and could n't imagine living anywhere else . Uncle Bias called emigrants to America gusanos . Worms . <p> " We 'll have a good life in America , " Magda said . She drove left handed , her right arm draped over my seat . We 'd loaded the backseat with breadfruit and wine bottles filled with water . " Stop living in the past . You 'll end up like Gregorio , stealing tobacco leaves to roll cigars for a dead prime minister . Or like Uncle Blas , who never left Playa Giron . " The tires whined like angry bees on the asphalt inside the tunnel , and my mouth felt sticky from the wine and cigars the night before . <p> Outside the city we drove past Microbrigada-built blocks of flats and Florida-style beach cottages with chairs leaning against them , facedown so the rain would run off . The sea breeze carried reports of automatic gunfire from roadside shooting ranges through our open windows . Metal cutouts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tight uniform sat astride an Italian motorcycle , waiting for speeders . Magda 's Montuno was incapable of breaking the posted limit . <p> It was late afternoon when we reached Varadero . We had spent the morning caulking all the joints and seams of the Montuno with body putty . The doors were sealed , and we had to enter and exit the car through the windows . We needed to think this out more , weigh our chances . <p> There was a golf course on one side of the road , the sea on the other . A large billboard read : CIA  --  La Brigada Mercenaria , and pictured uniformed thugs landing at Playa Giron with sunglasses and high-powered sniper rifles . I wondered if the invaders still revisit Uncle Blas and his companeros on that beach in their own stories . Beneath the billboard sat a woman who wore the red scarf of the revolution , eating moros y cristianos from a greasy paper bag and washing them down with a cloudy bottle of aguardiente . <p> " We 'll never get the Montuno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued past a string of luxury hotels built in the ' 50s . Canadians and Danes on hired Soviet bicycles wobbled in front of our car . The tourist police gave Magda hard looks , as if they thought she might be a prostitute . <p> " Too crowded , " Magda said . " Besides , the tourists like to fornicate with the tour guides on the dunes . " <p> We stopped at a Copelia for ice cream , a five-minute wait to pay and get a slip of paper , twenty minutes more to exchange this for ice cream . The woman sweated into the containers while she scooped it out . Vanilla was our only choice . I needed more options . <p> We overinflated our tires at a filling station , against the warnings of the attendant , then continued driving until we found a deserted stretch of beach on the east side of the peninsula , away from the hotels and the tourist police . <p> " Perfect , " Magda declared , pulling onto the sand . " Help me remove the engine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor from the bracket and drive train . We had removed the Montuno 's engine once before and carried it up to our apartment , where Magda completed a valve job on our kitchen table . <p> We left the engine on the sand  --  along with the transmission , the battery , the backseat , and several liters of siphoned petrol-and pushed the Montuno into the ocean . The little red car bobbed in the surf like a buoy . <p> I climbed through the passenger window and settled into the zebrastriped seat . Magda sat behind the wheel . A thin trickle of water crept beneath the passenger door , but otherwise the car was seaworthy . <p> " Push , " Magda ordered , pulling on the front bumper . <p> " It 's stuck , " I said . I was crotch-deep in the ocean , trying to shove the little car over a sandbar while the waves beat us back toward the shore . In the past hour we had traveled only fifteen meters from Cuba . A few drops of rain splattered on the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , trying to carry me out to sea  --  a sign that the tide was finally changing in our favor . I got on my knees and wedged my shoulder beneath the back bumper , the sea lapping at my chin . At that moment , a swell lifted the Montuno and swept it over the sandbar . <p> I fell forward . A wave struck me full-face . By the time I came up sputtering , the undertow had already pulled the car twenty meters out to sea . Magda stood on the driver 's seat , leaning out of the window and waving at me frantically . <p> I stood on the sandbar , calculating the odds of reaching Magda through the rough sea . I was a poor swimmer . Even if I made it , what chance did we have ? A large shadow glided in front of me , and I thought I saw the curve of a fin just beneath the surface . Another wave erased the image with sea foam . <p> " Hurry , Felix ! " Magda 's voice sounded over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ears , muffling the rolling surf and thunder . Far out to sea , a flash of orange caught my . eye . I stared at it , thinking a gunboat had come to intercept us . It was a channel marker . A wave swept my legs from beneath me , and I struggled to stand again . The current had pulled the Montuno fifty meters farther away , and so the matter was settled . <p> Magda 's features faded as the distance grew between us , until all I could see was her lipstick in the dimming light . The receding tide fully exposed the sandbar , and the sky darkened . I could no longer see the bright red Montuno that bobbed on the horizon . Sand fleas fed on my legs , and a sense of loss shuddered through me , unmeasurable . Uncle Bias was wrong  --  there are more painful wounds than a gunshot to the belly . <p> East of my sandbar and across the Atlantic lay Angola , Blas 's storyland , where bees and swarms of South African soldiers chased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew overhead , seeding the clouds with silver iodide so our politicos could boast of the progress we are bringing to our African comrades . No wonder Uncle Blas and old Gregorio chose to live in another time . <p> I swam in my clumsy dog paddle back to the beach , trying to keep my head above the breakers . What were the percentages that I 'd ever see Magda again ? I thought of my former boss , the ministry jefe who manipulated statistics to suit himself . Seventeen-and-a-half percent chance Magda and I will meet again , I decided . Oddly , the arbitrary figure comforted me . <p> I thought about walking back to Varadero to find a maquina going to Havana , where I 'd smoke Winston Churchill cigars with Uncle Blas and Gregorio , wait my turn to tell stories of Magda , linger in the apartment on Calle Cuartlesand until the army came for me . Time seemed to have vanished , as if it had floated out into the Caribbean with Magda . <p> My hands were restless , and I took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , even though I knew the string was saturated with seawater .
