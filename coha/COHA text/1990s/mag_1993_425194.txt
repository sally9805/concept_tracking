<p> Clinton 's national service prototype was largely a poverty program disguised as a sensitivity seminar <p> Standing before a hand-painted banner of a huge glowing sun and sliding easily into the talk-show format that has become his trademark , President Clinton was in his element as he addressed the hundreds of college-age students who had just completed the " Summer of Service , " his first national service initiative . Mutual congratulations and youthful optimism filled the air . " We could revolutionize our country . There are no problems we can not solve , there is no future we can not have , " he told them to wild cheers . <p> National service for youth is at the heart of Clinton 's vision of a revitalized America and a new Democratic Party , and it is on the verge of becoming a reality . In August , Congress obliged the President by enacting the National Service Act of 1993 , which will provide scholarships to students who perform community service . The effusive bipartisan rhetoric that surrounded the legislation 's passage conjured up images of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clean streets . But the reality of national service may turn out to be something quite different . If the Summer of Service is any indication , national service under Clinton will be short on civic responsibility and actual service , long on racial politics and therapeutic self-esteem training , and hard on the taxpayer 's pocketbook . <p> The Summer of Service ( SoS ) , a ten-week program that ran from mid-June to mid-August , gave 1,400 students from around the country $1,000 education vouchers in return for working eight-hour days at a subsistence wage on community projects . While substantially smaller than the National Service Act  --  which will give 100,000 participants school vouchers worth close to $10,000 in return for two years of service ( participants are also eligible for child care , health care , and salary supplements from private matching funds )  --  the SoS was billed by the Clinton administration as a prototype for the more ambitious endeavor . <p> That is a real cause for concern . The Commission on National and Community Service , which ran SoS and will become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high on its list of criteria for groups applying for SoS funds . Applicants were expected to recruit participants from " diverse racial , economic and educational backgrounds . " The students ultimately chosen for SoS , however , were anything but a portrait of America . According to Jennifer Eblett Reilly , the national director of the Summer of Service , about 75 percent of the participants in SoS were minority 42 percent African-American , 15 percent Latino , 13 percent Asian , and 4 percent Native American . Further , although the Commission itself does n't have figures on socio-economic background , interviews with numerous people involved with the program suggest that a sizeable majority of participants came from low-income families in our inner cities . <p> Most SoS staffers argue that high minority participation was necessary to win the trust of the largely minority communities that SoS participants were to serve . But ironically , and perhaps predictably , the Commission 's zealous effort to breed harmony through inclusion had almost the opposite effect . Before SoS began , the participants were flown in from around the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-service training . According to attendees , who asked not to be named , the gathering quickly balkanized . Ethnic groups formed separate cliques and then squared off against their hosts . One " facilitator " recalls the chill that went up her spine when she heard a voice call out over the loudspeaker , " All African-Americans please assemble now . " His panic and gay , lesbian , and bisexual participants also held separate meetings to discuss how the SoS was n't meeting their particular needs . The fiasco culminated at a forum on the final day , which was attended by Eli Segal , the director of the White House Office of National Service . The newly formed African-American caucus issued a list of demands , including that the leadership of the Commission have more minorities ( Catherine Milton , who is executive director of the Commission , and Segal are white ) . <p> Even more worrisome than the Commission 's notion of racial diversity is its determination to turn over as much of the program as possible to at-risk youth . Interviews with several of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures of leadership , like good grades or participation in school activities . Instead , community groups were told that in evaluating " non college-bound youth " they were to look for " leadership potential " and " diversity in accomplishment " ( i.e. students who fall short of formal standards ) . Program coordinators brag about recruiting former gang members , drug dealers , and unwed teenage mothers . Seth Goldman , who directed 50 SoS members in tutoring projects this summer , proudly explains that his " best tutor was convicted of an adult felony for possession of a sawed-off shotgun . " <p> Why boast about bringing along former felons ? The answer lies in the persistent belief among SoS program directors that former criminals make the best role models because they " can relate to kids . " Since over half the SoS programs involved tutoring and education , you 'd think academic performance might figure as an appropriate standard to judge participants . However , like most of her colleagues , Debbie Stephens , the assistant director of BuildingUp L.A. , one of the 16 partnerships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because her participants traffic in very basic levels of information it is easy enough for everyone to stay ahead of the younger children being taught . <p> All of which gives SoS the appearance of a jobs program with a special emphasis on therapy . Reilly peppers her description of the program with the Hillary-esque catchword of " meaningfulness " and admits that SoS had two fundamental goals : national service and providing an " opportunity " for kids from bad neighborhoods to get jobs and to learn " self-esteem . " She argues , however , that the two goals are not at odds with each other and should be complementary : What better way for kids to learn self-worth and self-discipline than from working on a project to help their community ? <p> But most SoS programs were not content to let " self-esteem " grow from service alone . Many of the programs had their volunteers take daily breaks for gab sessions to share their experiences in the field and scheduled time for team-building exercises like group calisthenics . Emphasis was placed on what the SoS corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about growing and learning , one does not often hear words like " duty " " responsibility , " or " obligation . " There is little sense that this program met what one might call the JFK standard : A participant should consider what he 's giving to the country before asking what benefit accrues to him . <p> The question of sacrifice might be moot if the SoS workers unambiguously met genuine community needs . Many projects funded by SoS , however , were less related to pressing social need than to educational and political priorities that few would associate with national service . One project provided training in political advocacy . The Harlem N.Y. Freedom Schools  --  privately-funded , open admissions summer schools  --  hired 50 people with SoS money and taught them how to lobby , mount letter-writing campaigns , and use the media . Other projects included mural painting , cultural awareness lectures , diversity sensitivity sessions , and putting on carnivals to entertain kids who might be prone to join gangs . Nichole Gonzaque , a team leader in South Central Los Angeles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . " Some of these kids had never even heard of self-esteem , " she says , aghast . And the Commission gave $30,000 dollars to the St. Louis Hollywood Youth Corps to pay its members while they made videos about their community . <p> The Commission not only accepted programs of checkered quality , it also allowed participants to wander from their assigned tasks and design their own service projects . For example , 10 SoS participants who were supposed to help refurbish a garden with the nonprofit Newark New Jersey Conservancy became disenchanted with the project once they discovered how much manual labor was involved . With permission from the umbrella group supervising their project , the SoSers decided they would rather teach environmentalism in the schools . They chose three topics  --  biodiversity , " land pollution , " and global warming  --  and then " educated " themselves about them and designed presentations , all in the course of two weeks . Rondeep Kaur , the team leader , was unfazed by her group 's basic lack of education in these relatively complex areas . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children were helping to prevent . " We just taught them to respect plants and animals like we respect other people because we all share this planet together , " she explains . <p> The Commission on National and Public Service might believe such ad hoc environmentalism worthwhile , but President Clinton invokes a different ideal when he asks all Americans to assume the responsibility of service . We can only hope that the National Service program itself will be truer to that rhetoric than its misdirected prototype . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Summer Service Meeting . <p> by Leslie Kaufman <p> <p> Leslie Kaufman is an assistant editor at Government Executive Magazine . <p>
