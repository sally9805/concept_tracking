George Lindsey , who played Goober on The Andy Griffith Show and , before that , quarterback at Florence ( Ala . ) State Teachers College , tells one  --  and only one  --  football joke these days . A coach , holding a ball , asks his quarterback , " Son , can you pass this ? " The player says , " Coach , I do n't even think I can swallow it . " // Cody Gross , who plays quarterback at North Alabama ( formerly Florence State ) , has often held a football and wondered the same thing : Can I pass this ? Please , Coach ? // In 15 starts before last Saturday 's Division II title game against Indiana University of Pennsylvania , Gross , a 5 ' 9 " , 159-pound sophomore from Rogersville , Ala. , had thrown only 8.6 times per game . Of course when your team has gone 13-0 using an offense that averages 372 yards on the ground  --  heck , when your tailback is named Tyrone Rush  --  the notion of being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the title game Gross explained that North Alabama 's offense was not designed to showcase his arm . " We use our running game to set up the pass , " he said . And how long might that take ? " Sometimes 60 minutes . " // So it was that on Saturday , Lion fans filled Florence 's Braly Municipal Stadium anticipating Rush-hour traffic . Rush , a senior who ran for 106 yards per game in ' 93 , was one of three finalists for the Harlon Hill Trophy , which is given to the best player in the division , before running back Roger Graham of New Haven won it last Friday . The real Harlon Hill was an All-America receiver at Florence State in the early ' 50s and became an All-Pro with the Chicago Bears . Lindsey was one of his college quarterbacks . " We ran the single-wing , so the tailback was the passer , " says Lindsey . " Still , our favorite play was ' Harlon , go long . ' " // A few locals assume that Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than long . " Ever since they named that award after me in ' 86 , " says the 61-year-old Hill , " folks see me on the street and say , ' I thought you was dead . ' " // Folks felt much the same way about his alma mater 's option offense with slightly more than 12 minutes remaining in Saturday 's game . Indiana was leading 24-14 , and the Indians had been overplaying the option pitch all afternoon , preventing Gross from tossing the ball to Rush . Two plays after North Alabama 's Israel Raybon blocked a punt , Gross faced third-and-six on the Indiana 24 . Can I pass this ? Gross faked a dive to fullback Brian Satterfield and threw a TD strike to wideout Demetrea Shelton . // The game then became as frenetic as Barney Fife . Satterfield , who gained 180 yards on 23 rushes , scored two touchdowns to make the score 34-24 , but Indiana answered with a TD . A 34-yard field goal by the Indians ' Michael Geary tied the score with 0:45 left . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Goober . ( Lindsey , alas , was in Mars Hill , N.C. , as grand marshal of a parade . ) On the second play of the drive Gross rambled for 28 yards . Two plays later he rolled left , pulled up and lofted a 38-yard floater to Shelton , who hauled it in at the one . With 10 seconds to go Gross plowed in . " I 'll be honest , " he said afterward . " I was worried when they tied it . " // But perhaps Gross had forgotten that he could throw . Lindsey , who played a gridder named The Wreck in the musical Wonderful Town in the early ' 60s , could have reminded him . His show-stopping number ? Pass That Football .
