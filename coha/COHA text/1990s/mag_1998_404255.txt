1 : to present as worthy of acceptance 2 : to entrust to others 3 : to advise For more than 50 years the National MS Society has refrained from recommending specific MS therapy . But circumstances have changed . The doctors call them the A , B , C drugs-Avonex , Betaseron , and Copaxone . Leading MS specialists have reviewed all the available data , discussed their clinical experience , and come up with a consensus . The Society is now breaking precedent by issuing a formal recommendation to all physicians who treat people with MS . I 'd like to paraphrase it for people with MS : Let 's face the facts . These new drugs can slow down the ability of MS to rob people of their functions . If one of them is right for you , the sooner you start , the better you will do , the longer you may be able to go without losing significant abilities , like the use of legs or hands . So subject to an individual physician 's best judgment of a particular patient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we recommend using one of them-now . A report about the consensus statement is on page 32 . The full document is on our web site and at all our chapters . We 're sending it to doctors , insurance companies , and health-care advocates . The drugs are not perfect . They do n't cure MS . Taking them is far from easy-and they are expensive . But so is unemployment , or underemployment , or having to hire people to do things you might do yourself . We , the Society , will be advocates for equity in health insurance , for patient protections in managed care , and for full implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act to help people travel and stay on the job . We salute the efforts of Berlex Laboratories , Biogen , and Teva/Marion Partners in offering people insurance counseling and in reducing costs for the underinsured . We enjoin doctors who treat people with MS to accept our recommendation . It has been crafted by some of the most experienced MS clinicians in the world . We urge insurance companies to treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not sit quietly by if people with MS are discriminated against or denied coverage based on misinformation ! Each of us has a chance to prevent some of the devastating effects of MS right now . This is , and always has been , our mission . Do it now ! <p>
