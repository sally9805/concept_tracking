They are , quite obviously , well scrubbed and well off ; young white men and women in suits and dresses and polished loafers and fashionable pumps . They stand silently at scattered street corners in cities like Dallas and Orlando and now Chicago . With their small , multicolored signs  --  TSONGAS  --  they seem a diffident rebuke to the well-oiled effort supporting Bill Clinton . " How can they compete ? " asked a Clinton worker as he drove around Chicago last week . " We 've got the money and endorsements . Damn , there 's another one . You do n't think they 're having any real effect , do you ? " <P> Yep , they are . Before this week 's round of Super Tuesday contests , Paul Tsongas had spent only half a day in Illinois . But the latest polls show him within striking distance of Clinton , and his strength is not entirely inexplicable . As elsewhere , Tsongas benefits from the perception that he is a truth teller willing to inflict pain on a nation ready for castor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resonates among better-educated , higher-income whites  --  the very Democrats most likely to vote on March 17 . Around Chicago , Tsongas is also doing well among the white ethnics who voted for Reagan and Bush , not because he is seen as a strong leader but because Clinton is viewed as too slick . In another year , against a stronger field , Tsongas may already be history . This time , he is increasingly hailed as the only credible alternative to Clinton , and that may be enough . <P> For Clinton , Illinois has always been the crucial contest . He watched another Southerner do well on Super Tuesday four years ago , only to fail when the race turned north to the Rust Belt . " Al Gore did n't realize that he had to show immediate foot in the North to avoid being tagged a regional candidate , " Clinton said several months ago . " I 'll do well on Super Tuesday too , but Illinois is basically the ball game . If I score there , I 've got the momentum to roll in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , let 's just say it wo n't be pretty . Illinois is the real test . " <P> To win Illinois , Clinton is counting on doing well in Chicago . And to do well in Chicago , Clinton is counting on the machine , or rather what 's left of the Democratic organization that once ruled the city . Today there are many Democratic organizations in Chicago , and Clinton is favored by most . He won their backing because he was willing to play understudy . The pols who count in Chicago wanted Mario Cuomo . All Clinton asked was that they come his way if Cuomo chose not to run . " He gambled a bit , and it worked , " says William Daley , a son of the late mayor and brother of the current one . <P> Clinton 's new enemy is apathy . " With someone like Mondale , you had a member of the congregation , " says David Axelrod , a well-regarded Chicago-based media magician advising Clinton . " Fritz knew every significant Democrat personally and helped most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed them , they were there . Clinton 's just come to town , and the organizations have a lot of local contests they consider more important than the presidency . They 're ( for Clinton on paper , but the question is whether they 'll work hard enough to offset a surge by someone else . "
