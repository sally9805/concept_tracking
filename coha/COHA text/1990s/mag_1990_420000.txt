Section : LIFESTYLE TABLE <p> George Steinbrenner loves to study military history . On his night table these days is a volume about Custer 's Last Stand . That seems fitting enough , since Steinbrenner  --  the reviled Boss , the Steingrabber , the man so many love to loathe  --  could be facing his own Little Bighorn in the Bronx . Yes , his New York Yankees are having their worst summer since the Woodrow Wilson administration , but that 's not his biggest problem . This week , after months of inquiry , Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent is expected to decide if Steinbrenner 's association with a confessed gambler named Howard Spira means the owner and the game must part company . Everybody else , it seems , already wants a piece of George 's scalp : the fans , the press his fellow owners . <p> As usual , though , George does n't quite get it . The war drums are beating , yet he sees no irony in his current choice of bedtime reading . " It 's just the book I happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to learn about battles and victors . Nothing more to read into it . " When pressed a bit , Steinbrenner suggests that he feels no siege from his enemies ; in fact , he 's got them surrounded . " I 'll win , " he told NEWSWEEK during a two-hour interview last week in his Tampa office . " I always do . " <p> Welcome to the mind of George Michael Steinbrenner III , principal owner of the Yankees : the most famous and the most valuable  --  of sports franchises . George 's recurring blind spots  --  involving such All Stars as Reggie Jackson and Dave Winfield , 19 managerial changes in 17 years scores of off-the-field employees who have deserted him , federal election law and baseball governance  --  have gotten him into trouble previously . Eight times before , a commissioner has taken action against him . But the vise is tighter now : Vincent is investigating Steinbrenner for paying $40,000 in January to Spira , an ex-employee of Winfield 's charitable foundation and world-class hanger-on . Vincent will rule on whether the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . Other owners , who might be expected to stand by his side , are drooling . One told NEWSWEEK last week that , if asked , 22 of the other 25 team chieftains would vote to make Steinbrenner walk the plank . Hell , they 'd supply the sharks , so outraged are they by his boorish behavior and free-spending ways . All this in a season when the Yankee ball club itself , once the pin-striped pride of the major leagues , is currently its worst team , run aground and likely to lose 100 games for the first time since 1912 . Nor is Steinbrenner bombing out just in the Bronx . His Tampa-based American Ship Building Co. , the wealth of which allowed Steinbrenner to buy the Yankees in the first place , is in financial straits , posting losses of $21.8 million since 1986 . Company headquarters , once staffed with about 30 employees , is down to 11 , many of whom tremble at the mention of the Boss 's name . <p> Steinbrenner looks out at this strife  --  and thinks of Honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asks . " Lincoln said , ' I do the very best I can . If the end brings me out right , what is said against me wo n't amount to anything . If the end brings me out wrong , 10 angels swearing I was right would make no difference . ' I have that saying up in my office , at Yankee Stadium , in my bedroom , everywhere . " <p> The 60-year-old Steinbrenner is undaunted . Sitting in his spartan suite overlooking the quiet Tampa waterfront , proudly displaying " literally hundreds " of sympathetic letters , he simply refuses to see himself as the world sees him : the Leona of baseball , the most hated figure in sports . " The press has created that perception , " Steinbrenner says . " Walk down the street with me some time in New York . Construction workers , cops , cabbies , doormen-they all come up and tell me they 're behind me . " TABLE <p> At the beginning of 1973 , George Steinbrenner was an obscure  --  and rich  --  shipbuilder from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George , we 'll include that ) only a few miles west in Rocky River . His father , Hank , a rigid Germanic disciplinarian as well as a ferocious competitor in business and sports , had built the Kinsman Marine Transit Co. into a Great Lakes power . George eventually succeeded his father and merged Kinsman into his own American Ship , making the company even more successful . George liked business , but he liked sports more . While he excelled as a boy at the Culver Military Academy in Indiana , his subsequent athletic accomplishments were limited to being an assistant football coach at Northwestern and Purdue . Then , at the end of 1972 , he got his big break . <p> Steinbrenner had been leading a group of investors that wanted to purchase the Cleveland Indians . They failed . ( Whoever said the Tribe , the perennial bottom fish of the American League , always had bad luck ? ) But the Yankees were available . CBS , which owned the team , wanted out : it had managed to ruin a flourishing diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 44 years . On Jan. 3 , 1973 , Steinbrenner appeared at a press conference in the Bronx to announce that he was the coleader of a 15-man syndicate ( including John De Lorean and Nelson Bunker Hunt ) buyingthe Yankees for $10 million in cash  --  $3.2 million less than CBS had doled out nine years earlier . " I wo n't be active in the day-to-day operations of the club , " Steinbrenner told reporters . <p> This sounded standard enough from any baseball owner , let alone one who knew more from yardarms than pitching arms . As things turned out , it was just the first Steinbrenner lie  --  or , as he puts it , " statements that I believed were true when I made them . " He would go on to become the most hands-on front-office overlord that baseball had ever seen , so much so , the story goes , that employees feel they ca n't use the bathroom without checking with the Boss . Before he could start meddling too much l with the Yankees , though , Steinbrenner had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pokey . <p> On Aug. 30 , 1974 , he pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to make illegal campaign contributions to Richard Nixon , one I of his heroes . He was fined $15,000 . Three months later , Commissioner Bowie Kuhn suspended him from the Yankees for 24 months for conduct " not in the best interests of baseball . " Steinbrenner ultimately served 15 months of exile , during which many suspected he ran the team anyway ; one baseball source says that the owner regularly had lunch and drinks with his general manager at the time , Gabe Paul and " talked on the phone with Paul 14 times a day . " He came back just in time to witness-and largely finance  --  a revolution in the game : free agency . Veteran players were now able to sell their services to the highest bidder . To the consternation of his colleagues , Steinbrenner understood that he could improve his club overnight with a few shrewd millionaire moves . Catfish Hunter , then baseball 's best righthander , signed in 1975 and Reggie ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town two years later . <p> Despite turmoil caused on the field by the big egos and off the field by The Big Ego , George had built a winner . Like the Bombers of old , the Yankees won world championships in 1977 and 1978 . Yankee Stadium might have been the Beirut of baseball  --  players kicked dirt at one another , manager Billy Martin was irascible and George Steinbrenner always had a remark that fanned the fire  --  but the resident combatants were victorious . Nothing else mattered to the Boss . TABLE <p> After 1978 , the Yankees appeared in only one other World Series ( 1981 )  --  losing to Los Angeles  --  and that was most remembered anyway for being Steinbrennered . After Game 5 , a cut-and-bandaged George claimed to have been in a fistfight with two Dodgers fans . Even Edward Bennett William , his friend , fellow owner and occasional lawyer , was skeptical . " I 've heard of phantom punches , but never phantom victims , " he chuckled . For the rest of the 1980s and this year especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes everything . The good no longer makes up for the bad . Without a nice round number in the " W " column , the teem is just a traveling roadshow , with Steinbrenner often acting as the clown . Or bullying strongman . George still makes money with the Yankees . Revenue from TV and radio deals , ticket sales and concessions should total about $103.3 million for 1990  --  which means a winner is n't fiscally necessary . Not that Steinbrenner has any interest in selling , but baseball bean counters say the Yankees could reap between $200 million and $250 million . Yet the bucks do n't really count for much . George has to win . It 's always been that way . <p> It 's always been pretty crazy , too . Each year , he promises this will be the season in which the manager on Opening Day will actually still be around in October . Poor Billy Martin was yanked out of the dugout more times  --  five  --  than some teams change managers in a generation ; this year Bucky Dent did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erred even slightly in the field were shuttled off to the Columbus farm team like so many bad boys sent to their rooms . Team presidents changed 10 times . Such legends as the beloved Yogi Berra ( manager , 1984-1985 , then fired ) no longer show upon Old-Timers'Day . <p> Even the most minor details of running a ball club became crises for the Boss , who often mutates into the Tyrant . As in the case of the secretary Steinbrenner once fired for failing to make a plane reservation . He did it right from the airport , by phone . He remembers the episode , with an odd combination of pride and sadness . " Look , ' I said , I 'm going to miss a meeting because you screwed up . Just pack up your stuff ' . " George , feeling a bit bad about it made things right in the end , at least by his strange standards . " I called one of my guys and asked about her kids . I said , She 's got a young son going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ft . ' Sometimes I react spontaneously like that . " <p> Such stories abound . " Covering the Yankees is not like covering any other baseball team , and that 's because of the Steinbrenner factor , " says Bill Madden , a New York Daily News sports columnist . " He 's always in conflict with someone . You have to deal with everything other than baseball . When you count the years you 've worked with them , you have to do it like dog years  --  multiply by seven . " The atmosphere shifted from bizarre to sleazy with the disclosure this spring that Steinbrenner had paid that $40,000 to Spiral The question is , for what ? Spira alleges he got the money in return for " dirt " on Dave Winfield , then a Yankee whom Steinbrenner signed as a $20 million free agent in 1981 , and has been feuding with ever since . Steinbrenner , ever the chameleon , has different stories : he paid the money " out of the goodness of my heart " ; he paid it because Spira made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened Yankee employees and hinted that he would go to the press with stories of former Yankee manager Lou Piniella 's supposed " gambling problem . " Fay Vincent held private hearings in early July to determine if I Steinbrenner had once again violated baseball 's " best interests " rule . But the transcripts of the testimony leaked out , causing I the affair to become yet another front-page I story on the Boss . This time , the vitriol reached mob mentality . T'ROW DA BUM OUT : FANS and TIME FOR KNOCKOUT PUNCH , the tabloids counseled . <p> Vincent promises to judge Steinbrenner on the Spira-Winfield specifics rather than I his " overall stewardship " of the Yankees . A lot of folks think the commissioner 's got it wrong and ought to look at just what kind of man Steinbrenner is . " Most people do n't like George for the wrong reason , " says Jim Bouton , the former Yankee pitcher who wrote " Ball Four . " " They think George is a bad owner because the Yankees have n't won the pennant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that he humiliates his employees . " Steinbrenner wo n't talk much about Spira , citing deference to the commissioner . Nor will he explicitly acknowledge what most everyone seems to know : if Vincent penalizes the Boss , he 'll go to court and fight , even if the courts rarely second-guess baseball 's internal decisions . He says the facts will prove him right . Sources close to him say that private exhibits before Vincent suggest that the commissioner 's office was aware more than a year ago that Spira was making financial overtures to Steinbrenner ; since Steinbrenner knew back then of that awareness , the argument goes , he fairly assumed he was violating no rules . To the extent that Steinbrenner shows any fear , it 's that Vincent , his pledge notwithstanding , will look beyond Spira-Winfield . Even George understands he 's got some image problems . <p> What is with this man ? Why is this sometimes charming , engaging , giving citizen so often such a churlish , manipulative , imperious miscreant  --  once described as " a mouse studying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burden of Being George  --  first put on him , as he recognizes , by his father , who was so strict that the young millionaire 's son had to raise chickens to earn spending money . Or it may be simply that power tends to corrupt . " Get him away from power , and he 'd be a nice guy , " says Chris ( Mad Dog ) Russo , a New York City sports-radio host . TABLE <p> Consider George in the sulky . Several years ago another George  --  Plimpton  --  asked him to participate in a series of celebrity harness races for charity . For his first time out on the practice track , Steinbrenner was told by his teacher ( the late Hall of Fame driver Billy Haughton ) to stay safely on the outside . " I finished last , " the Boss recalls . " So I go over to this girl who is standing there to get my horse . All the other grooms are laughing at her . And she says , ' We bet when they run these races . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lost $2.50 . ' She was upset . So the next heat , I say , ' Screw this . ' I took my horse and fell in dead last . Then I pulled my horse and went for it , and just as I came to the finish line , right next to Billy , I went by him and just smiled . I won . The girl was collecting her money when I got back . " <p> " Winning means everything , " Steinbrenner instructs . " You show me a good loser and I 'll show you a loser . " Surely a man so shrewd must understand that his world view is rather limited at times , his behavior often pathetic . Hardly . " I 'm more of a Patton than an Eisenhower in the way I lead , " he says . " Maybe that 's a fault . I do n't know . But it 's the way I am . I ca n't change it and be effective .

" Throughout his life , the Boss has won a lot more than he 's lost , but lately he has n't won very many battles at all . Gaining back the hearts of Yankee fans may be his greatest challenge . 1952 Graduates with a degree in English from Williams Collegein Massachusetts , also the alma mater of future Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent ( class of ' 60 ) . George saw lite as a series of hurdles even then , and starred on the school 's track team . His master s degree in phys ed is from Ohio State , where he meets his wife , Jane . 1960 Gets into sports ownership by acquiring  --  reportedly against his family 's wishes  --  the Cleveland Pipers of the American Basketball League . Two years later the team goes bankrupt . 1973 With his shipping business booming , George goes shopping  --  and comes up with one great sports deal : the Yankees , for $10 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $250 million . The Yankees , as a ball club , are not what they used to be . Rut the stadium has been renovated , thanks to George 's threats to move the team to New Jersey . 1974 George is suspended for 15 months after being convicted of conspiracy to make illegal contributions to the Nixon campaign ( he was later pardoned by Ronald Reagan ) . When he returns , he hires Rilly Martin as manager for the first of five times  --  and the Yanks are on their way to becoming one big , dysfunctional family . Martin squabbles with everyone , including the infamous marshmallow salesman he meets in a bar . 1981 George gets mad when Martin says ( of him and Reggie ) : " One 's a born liar , the other 's convicted , " But he gets really mad when anyone knocks his Yanks . During the World Series , he encounters Dodger fans and injures his hand . You should have seen the other guys , the Boss says . But no one ever has . 1983 George has more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog at Yankee Stadium . When Billy Martin got in barroom brawls every night , it looked like the manager had hit bottom . Now he 's getting in topless barroom brawls . What 's a Boss to do ? Set a good example . But George manages to get fined $50,000 for insulting the umpires . 1987 Everyone knows that if you want to get to the World Series , you 've got to have the horses . George has long had an interest in matters equine . He owns a breeding farm in Florida , used to own part of a thoroughbred track and has driven in celebrity harness races against such fearsome opponents as Oleg Cassini and George Plimpton. 1990 George 's shipping business is in trouble  --  so much so that employees are denied a request for $130 to start a company softball team . The Yankees have a worse record than even the Atlanta Braves . And Vincent is looking into George 's relationship with a guy from the Bronx who is , to be kind , somewhat Runyonesque . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Shipping on the dock of the bay <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Just what Billy needed , another beer <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Fight of fancy ? <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Not so sulky <p>
