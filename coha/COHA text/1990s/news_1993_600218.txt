<p> BURBANK , Calif . When Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn attempted solo recording careers , nothing , nada . <p> But once those dreams were put aside and the lanky singer/songwriters hooked their frustrated ambitions to the same wagon , everything clicked . <p> " I think they were brothers and never knew it , " says Nashville Arista Records chief Tim DuBois , who connived to bring the two together . <p> The combination exceeded everybody 's expectations . <p> In the wake of The Judds ' demise , Brooks &; Dunn made the biggest debut in duo history . Their hard-driving Brand New Man album , released in 1991 , made boots scoot bigtime and racked up four No. 1 hits . <p> Leave the weepy ballads to Vince Gill and the message songs to Garth Brooks ( no relation to Kix ) ; the duo 's sole aim is to scar up those hardwood dance floors with the gotta-dance tug of songs like the current Hard Workin ' Man and the career-making Boot Scootin ' Boogie , the dance-hall classic that even invaded disco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to force themselves to come up with the lone ballad has sold nearly 3 million copies . The follow up , Hard Workin ' Man ( two ballads ) , debuted at No. 3 this week in Billboard . <p> Neither Brooks nor Dunn has a handle on the hows and whys . " I do n't claim to know what 's making this act work right now other than a strong label and a good , fun , live show , " says Dunn , 39 , the one with the rooster-tail of hair in front . <p> " We try to keep it loose , we try to sing in tune the best we can , but we 'll never be the Everly Brothers , " says Brooks , 37 , the behatted one who favors shirts for the un-shy . " Harmonies are probably the least of our deal . " <p> They 're sitting in the NBC green room , looking over the two bouquets and platter of munchies Jay Leno sent over as they get ready to perform and chat on the Tonight Show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's their first appearance , their clout enabled them to choose a sales-friendly date just prior to the release of the new album . They 're also being allowed to perform two songs with their entire band . <p> Though it 's a kick to be on the show , both of the savvy veteran performers know their act only really comes alive in dance halls and concert halls . " This is a real confined area for us to work in , " says Brooks . " We like to spread out and stir up a lot of fun . This is n't really what we do and I think we take a big chance doing this . I do n't think it will hurt us , but I do n't think it 's gon na help us a whole lot . " <p> In concert , the 6-foot-4 Dunn is the less flamboyant of the two , but his vocal intensity somehow matches Brooks ' manic leaps , duckwalks and near-violent guitar work . <p> " I come from the school where you just stand there and sing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I first saw Kix jumping all over the place and running to the end of the stage . " <p> Counters Brooks : " He still likes to talk about how cool he is and things , but I see Ronnie falling on his knees on occasion . " <p> It 's Dunn 's bear-down-hard voice that drives songs like Boot Scootin ' Boogie . He learned to belt and still maintain a country inflection from his father , a regional country performer in the Tulsa area . <p> " I was terribly shy , a little scrawny kid and he was always just beatin ' me up with ' If you 're gon na sing , you 're gon na stand up there and do it ! ' I remember millions of times him saying ' Sing ! Go ! ' " <p> Brooks , 6-foot-2 , who trades lead vocals with Dunn and has a more rock edge to his voice , was raised in Shreveport , La. , down the street from Johnny Horton . His first paying gig was performing with Horton 's daughter and later he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in both Fairbanks , Alaska and New Orleans . Eventually settling in Nashville , he wrote No. 1 songs recorded by Highway 101 ( Who 's Lonely Now ) , John Conlee ( I 'm Only In It For the Love ) , and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band ( Modern Day Romance ) . <p> Dunn , who was thrown out of a religious college for performing in honky-tonks , later made a name for himself in the Tulsa area . ( His bass guitarist was Garth Brooks ' sister , Betsy ) . After winning the 1989 Marlboro National Talent Round-up ( a pal , Eric Clapton drummer Jamie Oldacker submitted a tape of his music as a lark ) , he relocated in Nashville . <p> Both Dunn and Brooks were trying to land solo deals in 1990 when they were invited to lunch and introduced by Arista Records ' DuBois . <p> DuBois did n't mention that he sensed they were a potential duo , but suggested they try writing some songs together . <p> When they teamed up , " These songs kept poppin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the songs , they hoped maybe Alan Jackson would choose one for his next album . <p> " The first song they brought me that they 'd written together was Brand New Man , " DuBois says . " I knew we had something special there . It was obvious I had to convince them that they were an act . <p> " They both wanted solo careers very badly and had pursued it for so long , " says DuBois . " It 's not the same thing when you 're having to share that spotlight with someone else . I think there was that element of letting go of that dream . " <p> It probably happened just in time . Dunn says , given the large number of new country acts and radio 's tight playlists , " I think we got through right before the door closed . " <p> Along the way , they were signed up by Panhandle Slim , a Western-wear company that has a new line of Brooks &; Dunn shirts that the duo helps design . The major seller is expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which originated with a sketch made by Brooks while he was sitting on the bus . He 's since worn prototypes in concerts and publicity shots , prompting retailers to order 75,000 copies . Panhandle 's Jeffrey Hochster says most shirts draw only 3,000 to 4,000 orders . As Hochster puts it , a bolt of patented printed fabric " as long as 1,750 football fields " will be needed to fill the order . <p> The commercial tie-in is strengthened by Brooks &; Dunn 's popularity with young , college-age audiences . The two , both married , are known for performing some alcohol-free concerts designed for those 15 and up . It 's that youth appeal that led to Boot Scootin ' Boogie becoming a major crossover dance hit . Many non-country clubs picked up on the song last year , playing it three times in a row and besieging the label with requests for an extended dance mix version . <p> Though the duo was n't interested in " a disco-techno thing , " they realized their recording sounded low-key alongside punched-up dance tracks by Hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles dance-masters to make it " sonically stack up . " <p> " We made them promise under no conditions that radio would get ahold of it and that it would n't be sold , " says Brooks . " Next thing we knew , of course , it was all over radio . " <p> That led to public demand for the mix version , which was briefly made available in record stores before it was pulled . <p> " We did n't want to be the disco ducks of country is what it boils down to , " says Brooks . <p> The facts behind the act <p> - No. 1 songs : Brand New Man , Next Broken Heart , Neon Moon , Boot Scootin ' Boogie <p> - Awards : Named top vocal duo by the Country Music Association , the Academy of Country Music , Billboard <p> - Hobbies : Fishing , golf ( Brooks ) ; tennis , collecting cattle skulls and artifacts(Dunn) <p> - Marital status : Both married , two children each <p> - Hometowns : Shreveport , La .
