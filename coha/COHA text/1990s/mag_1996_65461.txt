On May 7 , 1994 , Nuggets center Dikembe Mutombo lay sprawled on the Hour of the Seattle Coliseum , cradling a basketball and weeping unabashedly over Denver 's upset of the Western Conference 's No. 1 seed , the Sonics , in the first round of the playoffs . His team , Mutombo tearfully exulted , had climbed all the way back from its nadir  --  a 20-win season in 1990-91. // Not so fast . A year ago , the Nuggets underachieved in the regular season  --  they went 41-41  --  and were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Spurs . This season Denver , with a 30-41 record through Sunday , is in danger of missing the playoffs . That dubious achievement would make the Nuggets the NBA 's biggest bust of 1995-96 . " This has been a total disappointment , " Mutombo said last week . " This is supposed to be a team on the rise . I was sure we would win at least 50 games . Basketball used to be fun . No more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Nuggets have also suffered from the cumulative effects of off-season trades that sent two solid veterans , forward Rodney Rogers and center-forward Brian Williams , to the Clippers for , among others , heralded rookie Antonio McDyess ; from complaints by forward LaPhonso Ellis about not starting ; and from the controversy sparked by guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 's refusal to stand for the national anthem . " Then there are the things you do n't even know about , " says Mutombo . " For four years , we worked on a particular defense , and this year ? We come out with a new one . Denver has moved from straight-up coverage to switching off more . Why ? Why do we mess up the good things we have ? " // While the trades of Rogers and Williams disrupted the Nuggets ' short-term chemistry , McDyess 's long-term potential is tantalizing . Yet Mutombo is irked that he was not consulted by management before the transaction . " When you work for the Denver Nuggets , " he says , " you are not included . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free agent this summer , has never been comfortable with general manager-coach Bernie Bickerstaff 's vision of his center as a 7 ' 2 " rebounding and shot-blocking wizard whose offense should be secondary . Now Mutombo wonders if it 's time to move on . " I know things will be good for me , if not in Denver , then somewhere else , " he says . // Mutombo 's agent , David Falk , insists his client is speaking out of frustration . " Unless something totally out of line happens in negotiations , " says Falk , " I fully expect Dikembe to remain with Denver . " // Although Mutombo is on course to lead the league in blocked shots for the third straight season ( through Sunday he was averaging 4.59 a game ) , this has not been his finest year . His rebounding average ( 11.7 ) , points per game ( 11.0 ) and field goal percentage ( .501 ) are down from last season , and early last month Bickerstaff sat Mutombo for the final 14 ? minutes of a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met privately for an hour . Both emerged declaring they were on the same page , yet Mutombo 's unhappiness was bubbling to the surface again last week , and Bickerstaff did n't appreciate the timing . // " We all have to look in the mirror and collectively accept responsibility for this season , " says Bickerstaff . " No one should escape that  --  not the coaches , not the players . What we need to do , Mutombo included , is ask ourselves , What can I do to get us in the playoffs ? " // Capital Crunch // It 's the time of year when teams with fading playoff hopes assume the tank position and slide to the bottom of the standings , angling for a better shot at a high pick in the draft lottery . But this season the Bullets , 4 ? games out of a playoff spot with 10 to play at week 's end , do n't have the option of packing it in . Washington , which has n't been to the postseason in eight years , gave up its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cavaliers in September . Besides , the Bullets desperately want to make the playoffs because 1 ) the players guaranteed it in November , and the fans expect it ; and 2 ) team officials are concerned that another letdown will affect ticket sales and marketing when the team moves to a new , $180 million downtown Washington arena in the fall of 1997. // " There 's no question we 're under some pressure here , " says Bullets general manager John Nash . " It would be very prudent for us to make the playoffs for fiscal reasons . Lending institutions look at revenue streams , which are enhanced by postseason play . " // Because of a season-long epidemic of injuries , the Washington front office holds coach Jim Lynam blameless for the club 's 33-39 showing through Sunday . Lynam 's future seems especially secure in light of the assertion by All-Star forward and free-agent-to-be Juwan Howard that " Coach Lynam is a reason I 'd stay . " // Yet sources say that if Howard leaves , Nash could lose his job . There already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia , will join old friend Pat Croce , the new president of the down-trodden Sixers , as his general manager . Croce has touched base with other pals with a Philly connection , including Magic G.M. Pat Williams ( he needs a change of scenery ) , Orlando vice president John Gabriel ( his contract is up , and he 's intrigued with the ultimate rebuilding job ) and NBC analyst Matt Guokas ( interested in a G.M. job only ) . // Line of the Week Rockets forward Mark Bryant , March 27 versus the Mavericks : 28 MIN , 12-18 FG , 6-9 FT , 30 points , 11 rebounds . Even though Houston lost 117-114 , Bryant 's effort was heroic because he was anchoring an undermanned starting five that included CBA importees Sam Mack and Tracy Moore , plus veterans Chucky Brown and Kenny Smith . Rockets mainstays Sam Cassell , Clyde Drexler , Mario Elie , Robert Horry and Hakeem Olajawon all were down with injuries . // Around the Rim // Look for the Pacers to move reserve point guard Haywoode Workman in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

And on the road trip that followed Ceballos 's March 25 reinstatement , he stayed on a separate floor from the rest of the players .... // The Celtics are now thinking they might have overpaid free-agent guard Dana Barros ( six years , $20 million ) , who was averaging 12.7 points and 4.11 assists through Sunday . Boston should check with Washington , which still wants the three-point specialist .... // At week 's end Raptors point guard Damon Stoudamire was on course to play 3,270 minutes this season .
