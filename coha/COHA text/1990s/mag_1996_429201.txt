Wildlife understand " the secrets of life . " So should you because it Headnote could keep you alive . // I 'm hiking through a wildly beautiful Colorado mountain meadow , several miles from basecamp and 1,000 feet below the Continental Divide , when the sky suddenly goes dark . My day adrift in nature , I fear , is about to hit the fan . Sure enough , within minutes I 'm under assault by lightning , thunder , driving rain , and swirling fog-your standard surprise September storm in the high San Juans . And par for my course , my high-dollar , high-tech rainsuit is back in camp . When hail like shrapnel joins the attack I flee like some panicked animal for the shelter of the nearest finger of forest . As I enter the dripping woods , something huge and vaguely ominous materializes a few yards ahead , then melts back into the gloom . This is dead-center the only place in Colorado that might still hide a last few ghostly grizzlies and my pulse quickens at the possibility . Happily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry over to where the mysterious animal had been bedded and there , in the lee of an umbrella-limbed , oldgrowth spruce , I find a bathtub-size oval of cushy duff scraped clean of ground litter . And dry as Noah 's socks . A pungent barnyard stench confirms it : wapiti . I gratefully claim the earthy ark for my own and settle in for the duration of the storm . The elk 's ability to locate such refuge as this is amazing , even if it is the result of mindless instinct , like a dog circling before it lies down . It 's an innate inclination hard-wired into the beast 's cerebral circuits through countless millennia of selective reinforcement . Or , perhaps , finding nest sites that will remain sheltered and dry in most any weather is a learned skill in elk , passed down from cow to calf , generation to generation . The wapiti are n't saying . My curiosity stirred by circumstance and with some time on my hands , perhaps all night if this storm insists , I 'm soon lost in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals know ? Certainly , animals know more than we do about comfort , navigation , survival , and other such basics of " woodsmanship . " Witness the ptarmigan , an alpine grouse that escapes killing blizzards by diving deep into powdery snow , wherein it finds shelter from screaming arctic winds and insulation against the subzero cold . Arctic foxes and hares do much the same . Thus , did each of these humble beasts independently invent the emergency snowcave . At the opposite extreme , desert animals know enough to take care of all strenuous business at night and along the cool edges of twilight , then siesta in shady hidey-holes during the frying hours . By doing so they avoid dehydration , heat prostration , sunburn , cataracts , and scorched feet , while demonstrating a basic sort of intelligence animalia that 's rare , sometimes fatally so , among human desert rats . And animals know enough to relax and enjoy life . Just the other day a hiking companion and I were sitting quietly in the shade of a tree watching some mallards fool around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounding out of the woods and leapt explosively into the pond , sending the ducks into flight and little waves sloshing onto the shore . For the next quarter-hour we spied as the big cow splashed , submarined , blew bubbles , kicked the water and stared , mesmerized , as the wave-circles it 'd made expanded increasingly outward , like well-lived lives . The elk 's aquatic freak-out served no apparent " practical " purpose , such as drowning mosquitoes . It was play for play 's sake . Traditional biology argues that even such seemingly spontaneous behaviors as play can be chalked up to " innate tendencies " rather than conscious intent . But when I 'm caught out in a pelting hailstorm , I do n't give a whit how that elk knew to find its cozy hideaway . All I know is I 'm mighty glad it did , and that I knew enough to look for said hideaway when the wapiti vacated it . There are plenty of similar ways you can benefit from animal wisdom , whether it 's finding shelter from the raging elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some bubbles now and then . What follows is a brief collection of beastly wisdom that may not have been strictly verified by scientific method , but as any savvy outdoorsperson will tell you , this is knowledge that has been distilled over eons in the unforgiving crucible of survival : Male tree crickets chirp faster when the temperature rises , more slowly when the mercury drops . To get an approximate temperature in degrees Fahrenheit , count the chirps from one cricket for 15 seconds , then add 40 . Increased activity and duration of feeding among fish , birds , and wild animals may indicate a dropping barometer and the approach of stormy weather . Take note and be prepared . If caught out in a sudden rain- , hail- , or snowstorm without proper clothing or shelter , search for an elk or deer bed ( as I did ) beneath overhanging limbs on the lee side of mature conifers , especially spruce and fir . Come to think of it , no ungulate need to have actually bedded there ; the point is to look for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're caught out overnight in nasty weather without a tent and have neither the time , energy , materials , or know-how to build an emergency shelter , take a tip from rabbits and other animals and burrow beneath a brush pile-which , of course , you 'll probably have to assemble yourself on the spot . In most snow-free forested areas , one motivated person can gather enough leaves , limbs , and other forest debris to build a Volkswagen-size brush pile within minutes , even in the dark . Tunnel in near the bottom and worry about bugs another time . You can do the same pile-up trick with snow when it 's otherwise too shallow for cave building . Animals will sometimes dig in the gravel near dry creekbeds to find water . You can benefit from their well digging just as other animals and birds have learned to . Nationally respected black bear biologist Tom Beck offers this one . In winter , on a shallow frozen creek , he found where a deer had pawed a substantial amount of dirt out onto the ice . Curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behold , saw that the deer had returned to lap up the muddy meltwater . " I 'm not saying that deer understand and consciously employ the principles of solar heating , " says Beck , " but I do know that a deer intentionally pawed dirt onto ice and the same deer returned later to the same spot to drink from the little pool of water melted by the heat absorbed through the dark-colored dirt . " The animals , above all else and beyond argument , know " the secrets of life , " as evidenced by their uncanny ability to hang on under the sometimes desperate conditions of a life outdoors . As suddenly as it came , the wind now flags . The rain fizzles and stops . And thanks to the practical intellect of the cud-chewing elk that pawed out this sheltered nest , I 've ridden out a horrendous storm , sans raingear , sitting pretty-pretty dry , pretty warm , pretty comfortable , pretty grateful . I stand and stretch and stumble out through the dark , dripping trees and back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted some hours ago . Night has slammed down hard and black as obsidian , erasing all landmarks and shifting my mood from philosophical to paranoid : Where am I , and which way back to camp ? From somewhere out in the inky void rises an eerie wail followed by a staccato series of braying chuckles . My reluctant wapiti landlord , I suppose , enjoying the last laugh . That " dumb " beast out there is already home , while I have yet to find my way . Sidebar The Paws That Refresh Abundant animal and bird tracks around the edges of a spring , stream , or other surface water source , especially in the desert , indicate the water is probably safe to drink in an emergency . But beware : Many animals can tolerate greater amounts of alkali and other toxins than humans , and tracks do n't comment on giardia and other microparasites to which wild animals are largely immune or simply have to live with . Use standard purification precautions if possible . // <p>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
