This quixotic Frenchman obsessively pursued a lifelong dream of creating an independent nation in the remote territories of Araucania and Patagonia <p> ON JANUARY 10 , 1862 , in the town of Los Angeles in the Republic of Chile , after having sworn to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , the prisoner in the dock declared that his name was Prince Or , lie-Antoine de Tounens ; that he had been born in France , in the Department of Dordogne ; that he was 36 years old ; that he had been a resident of Chile or Araucania since August 22 , 1858 ; and that he was single and had no occupation . He called himself the " King of Araucania . " Five days before , in the early afternoon the Prince was resting against the trunk of a pear tree in an idyllic spot in the territory of Araucania . Suddenly , a detachment of police appeared , took his belongings , tied his wrists and legs , unceremoniously secured him on his horse and took him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge holding the perfunctory hearing knew little of the details of the remarkable adventure that had brought Orlie-Antoine de Tounens before him . The intrepid Frenchman , as would later be revealed , had crossed the ocean alone with very little money and no weapons ; he had entered a land forbidden to whites ; he had established contact with wild Indian tribes whose language he could not speak ; and he had succeeded in having them proclaim him their king . <p> A war tribunal later held a second hearing in his case . The principal witness for the prosecution was Resales , the servant who had been with him at the time of his apprehension  --  and who had set him up . Either because he had suspected that His Highness ' quest was senseless or seditious , or because he expected a reward , the cunning Rosales denounced him . By sheer luck , some witnesses favorable to Orelie-Antoine 's cause happened to be present  --  a group of Chilean merchants , who had been selling their wares in the Indian territory and who had from a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being shot then and there . <p> During the proceedings Orelie-Antoine maintained that he was a free citizen of Araucania and protested that he was being wrongfully deprived of his freedom . He also reaffirmed that his mission was to establish peace between the Chilean government and the peoples of Arauca . Thus began a legal proceeding that was to last nine months and three days . <p> After the prisoner underwent interrogation by the judge in Los Angeles , he was sent to a jail of dismal repute . There , Orlie-Antoine de Tounens became very ill . For a whole month he was semiconscious . In the next four months , as the fevers gradually gave way , he lost weight and became , in his own words , a " skeleton . " He also lost his long , black , beautiful hair . He could barely continue with his defense , with the writing of his diary ( which he did with perfect calligraphy ) , and with the sending of the letters that kept him in contact with the outside world . <p> To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his case  --  and of the physicians who had to rule on his mental capacity  --  Orlie-Antoine carried out his defense with no professional help . He displayed unbelievable sagacity and judicial shrewdness . In the end , after giving lengthy explanations for his presence in Araucania  --  and after effectively rebutting all the arguments used by the authorities to justify sentencing him to the most severe punishment available under the law  --  Orlie-Antoine accepted the disposition that the Chilean judges offered to him in order to avoid an international uproar . He was found not guilty , but he was interned in a sanitarium for the insane . From there he was rescued by the French Charge d'Affairs , who put him aboard a ship sailing for France . <p> In a certain way , Orlie-Antoine was emulating Cortes and Pizarro , who  --  with the help of the Spanish crown  --  had crossed the ocean to become white emperors in the New World . However , Orelie-Antoine 's era was a different one . In 1860 , the Monroe Doctrine discouraged incursions into Latin America by foreign powers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could defend their territories . Orelie-Antoine 's timing was unfortunate . With his strong civilizing mission , he had arrived too late in the land of his dreams . The Making of a King <p> However , in the collective memory of the Araucanians , Orlie-Antoine I would remain as the foretold and hoped-for king who had vanished . The machis , Araucanian sorceresses , had predicted that a white man would come to unite the peoples of Arauca  --  peerless warriors who lacked a unified government and a king  --  and would help them end centuries of war and siege . This prediction fitted perfectly with Orelie-Antoine 's longstanding romantic obsession with the vast and mysterious territory . This convergence of goals facilitated the foundation of the Kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia in November of 1860 . Thanks to his good looks and princely manners , the power of his oratory and the tenacity that would lead him to organize subsequent expeditions , the lawyer from Dordogne succeeded in briefly reigning over a group of unruly Indian chiefs . What circumstances did not permit was the fruition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the salvation of the Araucanian tribes  --  their conversion from fiery warriors into " good " worthy of the white man 's protection and respect  --  ceased to be an impossible dream . <p> Orelie-Antoine was born of a family of landowners of remote noble origin in the Province of Perigkord , Department ; of Dordogne , on May 12 , 1825 . He was the eighth child and the only one who would lift a hand to recover his family 's title and the word " de " before the name Tounens . He was also the only one to go to Perigueux and finish school . " Having obtained my baccalaureate , " he would write later , " and being forced to choose a career , I quickly made up my mind to study law , with the sole objective of preparing myself for my future endeavors as a king . " In his law practice , Orelie-Antoine showed great equanimity , but his avid imagination and visionary instinct pushed him to try to change the face of one part of the world . His great ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adventure . He read history and geography , and in his conversations idealized the tribes of men he would call the " Araucanian Centaurs , " who defended their territories with knives and lances . Proud of France 's civilizing mission , he considered the loss of his country 's colonies in America a great injustice . <p> Driven by his pursuit of a kingdom and sense of equanimity , Or , lie-Antoine sold some of his properties and boarded a ship sailing to South America . The prince arrived in Chile in August 1850 . He had no money nor friends in high positions , and he did not know the languages spoken in his adopted country . <p> He spent two years in Santiago and Valparaiso , learning Spanish and establishing friendships . In the spring of 1860 , Orelie-Antoine de Tounens landed in Valdivia , a Chilean settlement close to the Araucanian border . He dressed himself to fit the image of a king , with a finely woven black and white poncho , polished top boots , silver belt buckle and spurs and a long sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant hair long and fastened over his brow with a red bandeau in Indian fashion . From the lavishly accoutered horse on which he sat , his bearing was majestic and impressive . As soon as he appeared , a rumor began to spread among the tribes proclaiming the arrival of a white man whose mission was to unify them and prevent the Chileans from exterminating the wild animals they hunted . The prophesy of the machis seemed on the verge of fulfillment . The Magical Kingdom <p> The Araucanian Indians had settled in territories that now belong to Chile and Argentina . A few centuries later , the Incas tried to extend their empire to the south , and were repulsed by the Araucanians . Although the latter had never reached the degree of civilization other Indian peoples attained , they were too powerful to be defeated or tamed . With resourcefulness and tenacity , they resisted not only the attacks of the Incas but also three centuries of hostilities and evangelical warfare on the part of the Spanish . With time , their domain was reduced to a not-insubstantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half , with forests and fertile pampas and good passes across the Andes . They were stark and sturdy , with an almost mongoloid cast of features . Their favorite diversions were tribal warfare , indolence , poligany and drunken orgies . <p> La Araucana , by the Spanish poet Alfonso de Ercilla y Zuniga , depicts this race at the peak of its military genius and strength . Ercilla awakened in his Chilean readers a sense of awe with respect to Araucanian heroism  --  and with it certain reservations about conquering them by force . The most dangerous consequence of this infatuation was that by the middle of the ninteenth century , the problem of incorporating Araucania into a civilized nation had not been solved yet , and its inhabitants , although under siege , were still independent . <p> As a man of the law , the dreamer from Perigueux understood that the new Republic of Chile did not have the right to claim Araucania among the territories it inherited from Spain , because the Araucanians had never been conquered by the Spanish . He thought that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Araucania should be respected , and that the Indians ' rights and lands could be protected with the sword and the laws of the new sovereign state that he himself would found . <p> The first Indian chief to understand and accept Orelie-Antoine de Tounens ' mission was Manil , who also facilitated the Frenchman 's journeys within a territory that had up to then proved deadly to whites . Together they discussed the form of government the new Araucanian state should adopt . Speaking on behalf of all the Indians , Manil opted for accepting a king . <p> With Manil 's acquiescence , on November 17 , 1860 , on the farm of a French settler named F. Desfontaine , Orelie-Antoine I drew up and signed a decree creating a " constitutional and hereditary monarchy " for a nation to be called " New France , " in the territory of Araucania . He also wrote its constitution and gave it a national anthem and a flag . Three days later , Orelie-Antoine met an Indian chief from Patagonia and decided to annex that territory to his domain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Relations Minister . One of the minister 's first tasks was to inform President Manuel Montt of Chile that Orelie-Antoine I had assumed the throne of Araucania and Patagonia . The king also sent copies of the decree and the constitution to the newspapers El Mercurio of Valparaiso , and Ferro Carril and Revista Catolica of Santiago . The text of the royal decree and a synopsis of the constitution of the kingdom of " New France " was printed in El Mercurio on December 29 , 1860 . <p> Having fulfilled these formalities , Orelie-Antoine de Tounens went to Val paraiso to await the Chilean government 's response . He spent his time writing letters to his friends and to newspapers in Perigueux requesting pecuniary support for his endeavors . He also drew up a legal code similar to France 's and made plans for the future of his kingdom . Everything the king did was in the open . But the Chilean government , which had passed from the hands of Manuel Montt to those of Joaquin Perez , continued to pay no attention to the progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Or , lie-Antoine I thought that his cause could be furthered if other tribes were to elect and proclaim him their king . With this end in mind , he returned to his domain a year later in the company of his servant , Juan Bautista Rosales , and two interpreters . <p> Araucania was about to rise up once again against the white man 's army . When the visit of the king and his aides was announced , several Indian chiefs decided to invite him to their realms and listen to him . In separate ceremonies be fore different tribes on December 25 , 26 , 27 and 30 , the king gave a speech in which he proclaimed , among other things : " Natural and international law empowers you to become a nation so that you can march forward toward progress at a steadier pace ... " There was no way for the king to know whether his interpreters had correctly translated these lines into the gutural Araucanian language . But each and every time he handed the green , blue and white flag of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were frenzied shouts of joy . The clouds of dust raised by the " Araucanian Centaurs " nearly suffocated His Highness . <p> Taking advantage of the enthusiasm demonstrated by his subjects  --  and determined to obtain a more permanent form of recognition for his accession to the throne  --  the lawyer from Perigueux drafted another memorandum stating that he had been elected and acclaimed as the " King of Araucania and Patagonia . " <p> The Araucanian kingdom threatened to demand from its monarch a considerable sacrifice . As a token of fidelity and respect , the chiefs offered him a wide selection of their dusky daughters , from whom they requested the bashful bachelor to pick out about half a dozen to be his wives . Not very eager to take on the responsibilities of marriage , Araucanian-style , at that precise moment , His Highness explained that he would wed the princesses , but requested that the nuptial ceremony be postponed  --  in accordance with Araucanian custom  --  until they had defeated their enemies . <p> Orelie-Antoine began a journey to other tribal realms in the first week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frightened by the effects of the prince 's unbelievable success , denounced him to the authorities and thus put an end to his imperial endeavors . The Steel Crown Endures <p> The press in France published the news of his return in disgrace and expressed more regret than admiration toward his feat . Orelie-Antoine de Tounens had to endure the journalists ' sarcasm . He was called the " available king . " The indifference and derision of his countrymen would be his constant complaint . But in spite of the many attacks coming from both hemispheres , he never ceased to fight for the throne , and used his pen to let the world know his version of history . <p> In 1863 he published his memoirs telling about his 1860-62 trip to Araucania . This book is striking in its tenderness toward the Araucanians and fills in all the details of the trial in Chile . It caused enough of a stir to allow him to find sponsors for his second expedition . It is very difficult to know whether his adventures had any impact in the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand began to push him back to Araucania . <p> In 1869 , the king sailed south in the Oneida and landed in Buenos Aires . On March 14 , a vessel belonging to the French Navy took him to a port in Patagonia . In his wanderings through these desolate areas , he befriended a number of Indian chiefs . He also had the opportunity to meet Julian Murga , an Argentine colonel , and protest the way the Argentine Army was taking Indians hostage . Sometime later , a tribe , unaware of his identity , took him hostage , and had it not been for the fortuitous arrival of an Araucanian chief who recognized and rescued his king  --  and helped him cross the Andes  --  Orelie-Antoine I would never have seen Araucania again . <p> His return was considered miraculous because the Chileans had spread the rumor that they had shot him . The natives enthusiastically welcomed him and organized celebrations in his honor . Orelie-Antoine did not waste much time in frivolous diversions . He established something called the " Order of the Steel Crown " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quilapan , Montret y Lemunao . He further asserted his leadership by appointing the ministers of his cabinet ( Quilapan was the War Minister and other chiefs were in charge of Foreign Relations , Interior , Justice and Agriculture ) . He gave away flags of the kingdom throughout the Indian territories , and by the end of the year there were reports of another Indian rebellion in Araucania . The Chilean government 's reaction to this news was to set a price on the head of the king . Although in the last seven years there had been improvements in the relationship between Chile and Araucania , the Indians ' response to the Chileans was to rally around their king . <p> In 1871 , however , Orelie-Antoine was running out of money , and hearing nothing from his friends , he decided to return to France . His departure from Araucania ended up being more complicated than his arrival because he had to convince each and every chief to authorize his leaving Araucanian territory . Crossing both the majestic Andes and the endless plains of Patagonia , he arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Buenos Aires , where he gave interviews to the most important newspapers in the Argentine capital , La Prensa , La Nacion and La Tribute . After a brief stay in Montevideo , he continued his journey back to France . There he published a second volume of memoirs ; established the journal of his kingdom La Corona de Acero ( The Steel Crown ) ; and continued to bestow royal favors and decorations . For the first time Orelie-Antoine began to worry about providing a successor to his throne . <p> On April 12 , 1872 , he used his journal to deal with this problem . He printed an ad requesting a " maid who would being to share his destiny . " The future queen of Araucania ( and mother-to-be of the crown prince or princess ) had to be " honest and from a respectable family , to be in excellent health , have good character , be intelligent , learned , beautiful and gay . " By the beginning of 1873 , he had settled in Paris and announced in a letter to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mademoiselle de Percy . There is no evidence that the wedding ever took place . <p> Soon Orelie-Antoine de Tounens was involved in his third expedition to Araucania . The king minted one-peso coins and bought arms and munitions with money lent by a French bank . Since he was now persona non grata in both Argentina and Chile , he decided to travel incognito . Upon his arrival in Bahia Blanca , however , his dark eyeglasses , clipped beard and mustache did not fool his old acquaintance Colonel Julian Murga . The army officer ordered his arrest on July 17 , 1874 , and in spite of having his false travel documents apparently in order , he found himself detained by suspicious authorities for over three months . After he regained his freedom , close surveillance by the authorities prevented him from following his plans , and he decided to return to France . <p> But his obsession with Araucania prevailed over his reason , and so there was a fourth expedition in early 1876 . Everything went well until he reached the port of Montevideo . On his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and afterwards had him arrested . When he was about to be allowed to settle in Patagonia , the king became very ill . He was taken to Buenos Aires in October and would have died a painful death had he not undergone surgery on November 7 . This saved his life , but Orelie-Antoine de Tounens ' body could not endure any further tormenting . He was put aboard the Parana and on January 26 , 1877 he arrived in Bordeaux . From Bordeaux he returned to his birthplace . He died there on September 17 , 1878 . Epilogue <p> The Indians of Araucania and Patagonia were finally subjugated after a number of military invasions by the Chilean and Argentine armies a few years after Orelie-Antoine 's death . For a time , here and there , the green , blue and white flags of the kingdom kept ; flying in the wind . Then they vanished , along with most of the Araucanian traditions , such as their military genius and the courage that Ercilla and many others had greatly admired . <p> Since Orelie-Antoine 's passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steel . " Because all members of the Tounens ' family renounced their rights to it , the successor was a close friend of the Prince 's named Gustave-Achille Laviarde , whom Or , lie-Antoine had also dubbed Prince of the Aucas and Duke of Kialeon . The pretender assumed the name Achille I and watched over his subjects from a distance In 1885 , he wrote a long letter to President Grover Cleveland requesting that the United States government recognize the autonomy of Araucania and Patagonia . After his death on March 1 , 1902 , the title passed to another son of Perigord , Antoine-Hippolyte Cros ( Antoine II ) . He was a well known physician , philosopher and man of letters . From this dynasty came the next pretender , Antoine III . In 1951 , Antoine III abdicated in favor of Prince Philippe of Araucania . Prince Philippe made a speech on behalf of the rights of the Araucanian people before the United Nations in 1961 and seven years later , he succeeded in having the United States accept a representative of the kingdom of Araucania-Patagonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the current pretender visited the south of Chile and Argentina , and called upon what remains of the indomitable race that had tong obsessed Orelie-Antoine de Tounens . There are very few descendants of those " Araucanian Centaurs " who needed a king to unite them and lead them to victory . Some of them have heard the legend of King Orelie-Antoine I , a Frenchman who was infatuated with his sacred mission and who donned a " Steel Crown " at a time when history had already passed him by . <p> MAP : REPUBLIC OF CHILE <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Fiercely independent and resourceful , the Araucanian Indians resisted centuries of warfare from the Incas , Spaniards and Chileans <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : An indefatigable lawyer , Orelie-Antoine I wrote the constitution for the hereditary monarchy of New France , created a flag and national anthem , and even issued currency <p> PHOTOS ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Among the successors to the Steel Crown were Gustave-Achille Laviarde , right , and Prince Philippe , below , who defended the independence of Araucania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institute for the study of the Araucanian peoples in France <p> BY MARTHA GIL-MONTERO <p> <p> Martha Gil-Montero was born in Cordoba , Argentina , and has resided in Washington , D.C. , since 1979 .
