<p> Congress , the White House , and the bureaucracy want to stay out of the plan that will cover 83 percent of the country . You can bet that if they succeed , it 'll be hazardous to your health <p> On September 22 , President Clinton told a rapt nationwide audience that when it comes to health care , " We 're all in this together . " Two days later Congress had a chance to prove it . Paul Wellstone , the progressive senator from Minnesota , proposed an amendment to an unrelated spending bill " to assure that members of Congress participate on an equal basis with their constituents in any health care system " put into law in the coming months . As Iowa Senator Charles Grassley admitted , " It certainly would be the height of hypocrisy to develop such a system for our fellow citizens , but exempt ourselves from it . " <p> And yet that 's what they 've decided to do . In defeating Wellstone 's amendment , the Senate showed exactly what 's wrong with Washington : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in helping those on the outside . Members of Congress , instead of putting themselves in the same plan that covers the little guy or making what they currently get workable for the rest of the country , want to be able to buy a better deal in the new era . The result will be a government that wo n't fix the system 's problems because the people running Washington wo n't be in the same boat as the rest of us . <p> Clinton 's plan , as it currently stands , would create a " core-benefit package , " a benchmark plan that would cover 83 percent of Americans . ( The other 17 percent are expected to opt out and buy more coverage . ) In his address , Clinton stressed " choice " as one of his six " basic values and principles " for reform . But under managed competition , those 83 percent are bound to lose a certain amount of choice , particularly on doctors they can see . There 's a loophole for those with a loaded checkbook , though : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the privilege-and affluent Washington wants that privilege . One of the capital 's best kept secrets is the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program , which lawmakers and the federal bureaucracy want to keep . " We have long been in support of national health care , " says Diane Witiak of the American Federation of Government Employees , " but we would not support a program that asked for a diminution of benefits for our members . " In other words , the people who are supposed to be watching out for the public welfare are perfectly willing to let the public twist in the waiting room while the insiders are protected . <p> We 're not just talking about being covered for luxurious extras like cosmetic surgery and in vitro fertilization . A recent University of Rochester study found that the uninsured , who have access to one-third less care , suffer serious problems such as more premature births and a 25 percent higher death rate as a result . The president is promising comprehensive coverage to all Americans but his program still allows a wide disparity in coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tens of millions of Americans will be stuck in the cheapest health plan in their geographic area . " <p> Stark is sponsoring legislation which would require every member of Congress to be similarly stuck in his home district 's cheapest plan to ensure that it offers high quality care . <p> Members of Congress , remember , are n't starving : With an annual $133,600 salary , they make more than 94 percent of their constituents and will be able to buy their way up . With Congress and the bureaucracy bailing out , the personal contact with the system that will be absolutely necessary to understanding what 's wrong and how to fix it will be missing . " If we say it is good enough for us , " Wellstone reasoned , " surely we will be working very hard to make sure it is good for our constituents . " <p> Though she ran as a " mom in tennis shoes " in 1992 , freshman Washington Senator Patty Murray does n't agree . As recently as December 1992 , Murray stressed the importance of congressmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People who pass policies about our lives need to understand exactly who we are . " But that was then . During the floor debate on Wellstone 's amendment , Murray insisted that senators should not " put ourselves aside from the rest of the country and bash ourselves " by not preserving the right to buy up and out of any package they impose on the country . " I happen to be the only mother with two children here to care for , " Murray said " I want to be able to make the choice not as a senator of the United States , but as a mother who goes home and talks to my husband and my family and does what is right . " <p> Wellstone retorted , " We are going to set an average price plan for middle class people , but . . . we know it will not be good enough for our families ; therefore , we want to make sure we are able to opt out of it . " Murray 's remarks put her in the same league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Dan Quayle saying he 'd support his daughter 's decision to have an abortion ( but no one else 's ) . <p> Do n't think personal involvement makes any difference to how Congress thinks ? Tom Harkin , whose brother is deaf , wrote the Americans with Disabilities Act ( from which Congress promptly exempted itself ) . On health care , Harris Wofford , one of the Senate 's leading advocates of a national health plan , has a good reason to make sure every American will be covered regardless of preexisting conditions . When he was appointed to the Senate in 1991 to replace the late John Heinz , Wofford signed up for the congressional health plan . Shortly thereafter , his wife became seriously ill ; Wofford worried that if he was n't reelected , his wife would n't be able to get any coverage at all due to her condition . <p> " Congress should be in the same boat as the rest of the American people , " Wofford , who supported Wellstone 's move , insists , " especially when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-staffed clinic on the first floor of the Capitol and an ambulance standing by while they 're in session . House members write a check for $234 a year to pay for check ups , exams , and medical advice ; senators pay $520 . But taxpayers underwrite these convenient services to the tune of $1.5 million . Would n't you like a deal like that at the office ? <p> As a congresswoman , Barbara Boxer bounced 143 checks against the House bank . Nevertheless , in her race for the Senate from California last year , she successfully positioned herself as an " outsider " and pledged to " shake up " an institution she called out of touch . But in September she , like Murray , invoked the need for her family to " decide what is best for us " in dismissing Wellstone 's call for Congress to adhere to the standard package . <p> I think it is a very dangerous precedent , to single out one group of people in society and treat them differently in this health plan , " said Boxer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's embracing it for herself and her colleagues . As Murray herself said , in the now distant 1992 campaign , " If you elect elites. . . you do n't have a group of people who understand . " <p> During a Senate hearing the week following the president 's address , Wellstone asked Hillary Clinton what recourse people would have if their care proves deficient but they do n't have the money to buy their way up . She admitted that " some plans might be more of a financial stretch than others . But until the new system is really up and going , we are not going to know which plans , whether it is high , medium or low-priced , will be most satisfactory . " <p> Well , we can probably guess . <p> Since most of us will be covered under the lowest priced plan , Wellstone and Stark are right : The surest way to guarantee adequate universal coverage is for the people in charge to participate equally with the bulk of Americans . Congress has a long and ignominious history of exempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . With Wellstone promising to reintroduce his original amendment and Stark 's bill working its way through the House , this is a chance to make sure that does n't happen with health care . <p> BY ALAN GREENBLATT <p> <p> Alan Greenblatt is a Washington writer . <p>
