Mother walked the carnival the night before I was born , making up her mind about father . By the time she got to their trailer , water flowed between her thighs . I was born a huge baby girl , pulling her uterus down with my descent . She needed repair and pints of blood . I heard this story often as I grew up . The older I got , the more vivid her account became . <p> Mother left my father , who worked the ringtoss , shortly afterwards . She claimed he was unreliable and smelled of cigars . I do n't know . Before I could remember him , the hook he used to take the prizes down with hit a live wire instead of the stuffed panda he was aiming for . " Big dumb Italian , " Mother said when she spoke of him and their three unhappy years together . <p> Mother met Father in Clarksville , Arkansas . The carnival had put up its tents across the highway from the diner where she worked . Life on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time more romantic than serving the same buck-twenty-five breakfast special , day in , day out . Had she known what she was getting into , how hard living on the road would be , she would have listened to her mother and never married Mario Spinetti . I know the story by heart . <p> When I was ten we settled in Fresno . Mother had married Frank by then . She said he 'd be stable , unlike you-know-who , and longed for the child Frank would have given her had it not been for the trauma of my birth . <p> I 've imagined my baby sister , a child fair and calm , free from the swarthiness and big bones bestowed upon me . I grew to five foot eleven and one half inches , and with each inch Mother reminded me that I was my father 's daughter . <p> When I was seventeen I bought a bus ticket to Denver and promised myself that if she could n't accept my Sicilian skin and my size 18s , I would never come back and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that , at least until today . <p> Mother and Frank still live in Fresno . " In one of the whiter areas now , " she 's reminded me over the phone more than once . I knock on their door , Tommy 's hand in mine . A man I do n't know answers it , and then I see it 's Frank , faded and shrunken . He holds a champagne-colored poodle who looks a lot like Lucille Ball . Like Frank , Lucy is old . She yips once and is quiet . <p> " Margo , Patrice is here , " he says . He looks at Tommy , smiles , and says , " Hello , son . " Frank 's a bit washed out , but he 's always been okay with me . " Hello , Patrice . " I lean over to kiss his cheek . <p> I 'm to spend three days here before I leave Tommy to drive to Stockton to meet my boyfriend . Sam repairs cooling towers , those squat buildings next to industrial plants . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could be a decent carpenter . The carpenters are nonunion . Sam says they only make ten bucks an hour and thinks that 's criminal , but I 've never seen money like that . <p> Mother 's velvet slippers snap on the foyer 's tile as she runs in baby steps with her arms unfurled . The wash on her hair matches Lucy 's coat . She looks fashionable in black harem pants and a red silk blouse , the same color as her lips . <p> She plants a waxy kiss on Tommy 's forehead . " So this is your little boy . Shame on you , Patrice , for keeping him from me for so long . " <p> Frank stands with his hands in his pockets . He sees our things and goes out to get them . Tommy 's clothes are in grocery bags . Mother eyes them and asks , " Kentucky luggage , Patrice ? " <p> I follow Frank into the living room . He turns the TV down and asks , " Want a drink ? " <p> " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten what having a drink means to Frank . I tell him water will do , and he heads for the kitchen . Mother walks in holding Tommy 's hand . He stands mute as he sizes things up . I do n't want to leave him here . <p> Tommy runs to one of the bags and pulls out a clay sculpture he made in his kindergarten in Denver . He walks back slowly and hands it to Mother , looking shyly up at her . " It 's a bowl , not an ashtray , " he says . When he first showed it to me , I made the mistake of calling it one . <p> Mother examines it closely and says , " Of course , it is . " <p> I begin to breathe again . <p> When I enroll Tommy in school I find out there 's a bus he can ride , but Frank says he 'll be glad to take him . The two of them are in the backyard planting bulbs . Mother and I sit on the couch watching them through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't stay longer , Patrice ? " As she asks me this , her voice grows sugary sweet . <p> " The job starts the day after tomorrow . " <p> " What is Tommy 's daddy doing now ? " <p> " I have n't a clue , " I say , bracing myself for her to tell me I should have married him as she has countless times over the phone , but she changes the subject again . <p> " So , this Sam , he likes to travel ? Like your daddy ? " I want to scream that Sam could n't be anything like him , but then I stop myself . Sam thrives on being on the road . He likes diesel fumes and truck stops and chugging down six-packs with his crew in motel rooms after work . He tried me out on grunt work on a job in Coalstrip , Montana , before we came to California , and I saw this side of him . I know he 'll never settle down and marry me . Sometimes I wake up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to do except follow Sam the way Mother followed my father . But , in the morning , I tell myself it 's not like that at all . I 'm going to earn a living . <p> " Sam likes to travel , " I say flatly . <p> It kills me to leave Tommy . The next morning , when I put on my coat , he screams at the thought of me leaving . I pick him up , and he wraps his legs around me . Even with his wails , I want to stay like this forever . <p> Frank lifts him off of me . " Your mom has to go to work , son . " He says this simply , and Tommy calms down . I give Frank a look of gratitude . <p> I find the motel in Stockton . It 's called the El Capitan and is in a bad part of town . Motels on the cooling tower trail usually are . Sam knows the cheapest places to stay all over the western United States . This one surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a resort . There 's an empty swimming pool in front . Wisteria vines , bare now , trellis the walkways . <p> Sam 's not there when I arrive . The manager lets me in . The room has a Moorish door and the shower is tiled , though some of the tiles have fallen out . For some reason everything is painted purple . It looks like a shrine . <p> I spend the afternoon reading a Cosmopolitan , then go to Jack in the Box for dinner . When I get back , Sam 's in the shower . I slip out of my clothes and sneak in behind him . <p> " Holy shit , " he screams as my arms wrap around him . <p> Later we 're watching the news , and he tells me J.D. and Poppy got in a car wreck coming back drunk from Bakersfield over the weekend . J.D. will be laid up for a few months , and Poppy 's in jail . He 's hired two Mexicans to replace them . <p> I sit up and turn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rafael and Jesse seem like good guys . They 'll be hard workers , and they wo n't get drunk . " <p> " That 's not the point . You said you 'd try me out as a carpenter if something opened up . " <p> " The company knows I 'm living with you . They think you 're going to be collecting checks for sitting around needlepointing . Give it time . " <p> Maybe he 's right . I 'll just tell everyone what I 'm worth and replace the next hand who messes up . I turn out the lights and try not to listen to the report on the gangs that are roaming the Stockton streets . <p> We have breakfast at Denny 's . When we 're done , Rafael and Jesse are by the truck . Rafael 's my age , though if Sam had n't told me I would have thought him older . He has eight children . I wonder who could have the time to have eight kids by twenty-nine . Jesse 's about nineteen , and I probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy until you see his eyes . He 's sharp and speaks English well . Sam says they 're from Michoacan . <p> Sam , Rafael , and I squeeze together in the cab of Sam 's pickup . Jesse hops in the back . We drive south out of town . Nobody talks . The music on the radio puts us into a trance as we pass gas stations and the Jack in the Box where I ate last night . <p> When we get to the plant there 's just one tower to overhaul , fairly routine work . I spend the day prying up rotten lumber . A cooling tower is a lot like a jungle gym . When the deck is off , we walk across joists looking down into a lattice of framing and fill , the plastic strips that disperse the water . Tomorrow I 'll punch in the new fill . <p> We 're going to meet the rest of the crew in Tracy next week where the job 's bigger . For now , in the evening , it 's just Sam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Denny 's parking lot . <p> The last day it 's raining hard . I worry about the guys standing on slippery beams as I punch the last of the fill in the bottom of the tower . When I 'm done , Sam climbs down and hands me a broom that he has cut the handle off of and tells me to sweep the basin . The last layer of fill hangs two feet above the concrete , and the rain has washed mud all over the floor . <p> " Ca n't Jesse do it ? " I ask . " He 's smaller than me . " <p> " He 's finishing up above , " Sam says . <p> I jerk the broom from his hand . " I love you , Spinetti , " Sam says . I lie on my belly and slither under the beams and wires and fill . I hear the rain all around me , and the cold from the concrete seeps through the plastic rain gear . <p> I 'm halfway done when my jacket rides up . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a wire . I 'm hanging two inches above the floor and have to take the jacket off to get down . I untangle it , but there 's no room to put it back on . I slide on it the rest of the way . When I crawl out I am covered with mud . Rafael and Jesse look at me and burst out laughing . <p> " I better get a promotion quick , " I tell Sam as I strip off the rest of my gear . <p> Jesse translates for Rafael . He laughs again . <p> We have to wait for Sam 's boss . A shed is open , and we sit inside on bags of cement . The rain pounds on the metal roof . Every time I move , mud falls off of me . Sam gets his sweater from the truck . I go to the back of the shed to change . He opens his jacket for me to hide behind , like that 's possible , and cracks a joke , but one look from me and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At least I 'm warm . I made ham sandwiches last night , but Rafael opens his lunch box and unwraps a mound of tortillas and hands it to me . The shed fills with the aroma of beef and chilies . <p> Sam wants to know how the tortillas are made . I hear masa harina and mujerand mi casa . Jesse tells us that Rafael 's wife makes tortillas fresh every morning . <p> I try to picture this woman , a little younger than myself , standing in the kitchen in the quiet dark of early morning . The steam rises from the skillet as she cooks the meat . I wonder if she would like me , understand why my son is not with me . I suddenly miss Tommy and feel bad for not calling him more . I 'm watching my money , but decide I 'm skimping too much . <p> The motel room in Tracy is seedy , and I am really angry at Sam . It turns out that we grunts get " laid off " after every job , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company does n't have to pay benefits . I never thought of asking Sam about this , since he has his , but he should have told me . <p> The whole crew of six guys is at Tracy , including Rafael and Jesse . We 're here for two weeks , but after the first week they do n't need me until the last day for final cleanup . The weather 's lousy , so I sit in the room and watch TV . <p> As much as I hate it , I think about Mother and wonder what she did to keep herself busy when she was on the road . Then I get to feeling blue , living like this , motel room to motel room , the only woman on the crew . There are no barkers , no sideshow attractions , but I feel I 've joined a carnival . I hate moving about . I 'm sick of Denny 's . I miss my son . <p> Next stop is Woodland . Sam thinks we 'll be in town a month , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bring up a bag of nails for Rafael . The sun is hot as it reflects off the roof . I lean against a fan stack , close my eyes , and listen to Rafael 's hammer . I spend the next hour working with him until footsteps thud up the ladder . <p> " I wondered what happened to you , " Sam says . I think he 's mad , but then he adds , " You sure look righteous swinging that weapon the way you do . " <p> " You 're lucky I do n't swing it over your head , " I tell him . " So when are you going to let me do this full-time ? " <p> Rafael catches what I say . " Sam , she 's good carpenter . " <p> " Yeah ? " Sam climbs down and his head disappears . He goes down a few rungs and then shouts , " Are you coming to lunch , or not ? " <p> Thanksgiving falls in the middle of the Woodland job . Rafael and Jesse head down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reno . Sam would have liked to join them , but he offers to drive me to Mother 's . I have five hundred and twentyeight dollars saved . I need at least two thousand , better yet three . <p> The valley 's crystal clear . Sam speeds , and we get to Fresno fast . <p> Tommy wo n't let go of me . Frank has saved all his projects from kindergarten . We spend an hour looking at them . <p> Over the turkey , Mother says Sam should visit at Christmas and maybe in January if we do n't have to work on that colored man 's birthday . She asks Sam if the coloreds are much of a problem in the cooling tower trade . <p> " Margo , pass the dressing , " Frank says . <p> She ignores him . " Are they , Sam ? " <p> Sam deflects her remark and changes the subject . I realize he 's basically decent . He rarely yells at me , and he 's never tried to hit me . Tommy 's dad did once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I threw him out . <p> After dinner , Mother insists on cleaning up herself . I feel like a slug , but after being shooed away from the kitchen , I undo the top button of my jeans and drop my big bones into the easy chair . The men are watching football , initiating Tommy in the ritual . I go pleasantly blank . <p> A few hours after we get back to Woodland , Rafael shows up at our door . He tells us Jesse was in an accident and ca n't return to work . Before I can ask if this means I get Jesse 's job , Sam tells Rafael to round up someone . Rafael looks at me , shrugs , and goes back to his room . <p> " Wait a minute . You promised me . " <p> " I never promised anything . " <p> Sam walks out , and I consider my options . I could drive back to Denver and get a job waitressing graveyard fairly quickly , but tips are lousy on that shift . Even if I stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have enough for first and last months ' rent , for school , or even for someone to watch Tommy while I work . I hate Sam right now , and I see the years ahead , working at nothing jobs , telling Tommy , " No , we ca n't buy it , " over and over . <p> The job ends in Woodland , and we go south to Buttonwillow , to the most rickety towers I 've seen . Sam says we 'll almost be starting from scratch . We stay in the one motel , a strip of five cinder-block pink rooms that the whole crew takes up . <p> Sam knows I 'm still mad at him for not letting me take over Jesse 's job , though I have n't said another word about it . He 's been real sweet , but I 've stopped kissing him . I have almost eight hundred dollars . I work like a demon , constantly budgeting , trying to figure out what I can afford to buy Tommy for Christmas . <p> Sam was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground up , but we just got word the company 's pulling out of the rest of the California jobs . <p> I do n't want to spend money on gas just to get out of here , but I feel crazy . On a day I do n't have to work , I wake up at four and drive to Fresno . Frank 's the only one awake when I get there , still in his pajamas . <p> We sit at the breakfast nook while I pour my heart out . Frank stirs sugar in his coffee , looking at the spoon with his pale blue eyes . <p> " We 'd be glad to take care of you and Tommy while you go to school , " he says . <p> I check myself before I say , no way , I can take care of myself , I 've never let you help before . It 's on my tongue like fire , but Frank 's not the one I want to hurt . <p> Mother flounces in wearing a yellow peignoir , already heavily made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank loves her . Frank 's okay . There must be something I 've forgotten about her , something for me to love I have forgotten how to see . <p> Tiny feet slap in slippers as she walks over to kiss my cheek . As I give it to her , she says , " You look so strong and healthy , Patrice . The work you 're doing suits a big girl like you , " and I wonder if she has ever left the carnival , if she has left a red bull's-eye on my cheek with her lips . <p> I say nothing , but go to Tommy 's room . The sheets have pastel flowers and twist around his body . I climb in next to him and stay until he wakes . <p> Tonight the lights of the traffic are like the midway Mother walked the eve of my birth . Sam does n't wake when I come into the room . He sleeps like a stuffed animal for sale , his face toward the wall . I turn on the bathroom light and write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I pack my things and walk out the door , going home to Mother , doing what my big bones tell me . <p>
