The Classroom : The Incident : The Principal 's Office : The Teacher 's Lounge : Departure : # School may be out lot the summer , but that does n't mean that the problems we have with out educational systems ate going away . Fat from it ... Jake West is a new writer living in Torrance , California . He and his partner are finishing up their first novel while also working on some screenplays . Arrival : The UV dome over the parking lot is in sight . <p> Merely a block away , Roger Stenner sits in his car at a dead-stop , clenching and unclenching the steering wheel in much the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his stomach . He is very late for work again , so late that he is now caught by a seemingly endless river of students converging on Rodney King Memorial High School . For a teacher , getting caught in the last-minute rush would have guaranteed his own tardiness once upon a time , but now he has some slim hope : the metal-detectors and the epidermal drug-scanners slow them down these days . If he can make a simple left turn into the gated staff-only access street , he can still beat his First Period English students to the classroom . <p> Bernie waves to him from inside the transparent Security booth , obviously recognizing his aging ' 98 Quark . Stenner would be willing to bet that any parking lot frequented by high-school teachers harbors a much higher percentage of old , ex-gas-burners like his than , say , a comparable garage used by bank executives . Or School Board politicians . It still costs a lot less to install batteries than to buy a brand new electric . <p> There was a time when Bernie would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids for a second and give him a chance to drive through , but that time belongs to the past . Bernie is even less likely to unseal his locks than Roger is to try nosing the car forward through the crosswalk , even with a standard feature like bulletproof glass in his windows . <p> So , instead , he waits through the five-minute warning buzzer and the shrill echo of the final bell in the distance . Even then , it takes a few more minutes/or the exodus to dry up , allowing Bernie to trigger the barricade . It rolls aside , and Roger Stenner finally makes his simple left turn , quickly , almost furtively , pulling into the side-street before some juvenile straggler can sneak through . He thinks , as he does so , that tomorrow he will be here early . That tomorrow will be different . <p> The problem is , he thinks that every day . <p> The Parking Lot : Most people keep their mirrorshades on until they get inside the building . They do this as a safety precaution  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun , despite the filter dome that the school district put over it  --  but it also gives them a kind of uniform anonymity as they arrive and file in through the security-locks . Most of the staff have noticed , consciously or unconsciously , and without really discussing it amongst themselves , that lately there is an advantage to maintaining a low profile . Specifically , since the recent change in administrative regimes . Since long-time Vice-Principal and Dean of Students Phillip Ligotti ascended to the Papal Throne behind the Principal 's desk . <p> Today Stenner has lost that advantage since , reflective visor or not , he is the last teacher left in the parking lot . And newly ordained Principal Ligotti walks up behind him while he is fumbling with his briefcase in the back seat . Stenner flinches and hesitates : Ligotti is a person he would recognize without even turning around and whether he was wearing mirrorshades or not , because Ligotti has an artificial servo-motor implant in his right knee , and it makes a tiny but perceptible whirring sound when he walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies . Stories vary wildly as to the origin of his injury , all the way from a Purple Heart in the Ukraine Action to a student riot during the South Central Secession to a really lurid one involving a bad divorce and a flight of stairs . Also , the implant causes him to throw his leg oddly when he walks , and other stories speculate that he does n't get the gyro fixed because he likes the psychological effect of the limp  --  slow , deliberate , remorseless . Intimidating to staff and students alike . <p> All of this flashes through Stenner 's mind in that split-second when he knows that he is caught and he decides on his strategy . Apology ? Excuses ? The hell with it . He goes for the bluff . <p> " Oh , hi , Phillip , " he tosses off casually while finally retrieving the briefcase . He straightens up and turns to face Ligotti 's perpetually flat , unreadable expression : not quite a scowl and never a smile . " Kind of smoggy for a walk , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have time for small talk , Mister Stenner . " Ligotti has a voice like a foghorn that smokes too much . " Second bell rang ten minutes ago . " <p> " Sorry , sir . I did n't realize . " Mister Stenner , huh ? Okay . Message received . <p> Ligotti grunts noncommittally and starts to turn away . As he does so , Stenner looks past him and catches a glimpse of another person hurrying toward the building . From the back , it appears to be the slender shape of Dana Alexander , the new Social Studies teacher whom , so far , he has only seen from afar . In another moment , Principal Ligotti will see her , and , on impulse , Stenner frowns and points in the opposite direction . <p> " Damn ! There goes another one , Mr. Ligotti . " <p> " Huh ? What  --  ? " Awkwardly , the older man swerves around , nearly losing his balance . <p> " Behind those cars . Right through there  --  see him ? " Stenner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not too overdone . <p> " Another streaker ? " <p> Stenner nods . " Well , on rollerblades , at least . And it looked like he had a spray can to me . How do these kids keep getting in here , anyway ? " <p> He starts after the imaginary trespasser , but Ligotti waves him back . " Take your class , Mr. Stenner . I 'll handle this . " <p> " Okay , sir . Good luck . " Stenner grins to himself as he hurries after the elusive Ms. Alexander , who has already cycled through the outer lock . It occurs to him that if he catches up , he can use the favor he just did for ' her as a great opening line . <p> Behind him , the whine of Principal Ligotti 's knee increases in pitch as he lumbers away . Like a juggernaut starting to roll downhill into the enemy , accelerating as he goes . <p> The Access Corridor : . " I always feel like a rat in here . " This is certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he even surprises himself when it slips out . <p> No less surprised , apparently , is Dana Alexander . " I beg your pardon ? " she replies , her eyes wide and her eyebrows raised apprehensively . He can see her taking a mental step back from him . <p> " You know what I mean . " Flustered , but hiding it , he tries to recover his poise . " They built these damn tunnels so narrow , there 's hardly enough room for two people to walk side by side in here . " He drops his voice to a sinister pitch . " Or maybe it 's the way you can hear the muffled voices from the classrooms as you scurry along behind the walls ... " He grins to let her know that he is joking . <p> " Well , I heard this old place was built clear back in the Sixties , " she says . <p> " Yeah , about four decades and three name-changes ago . " Meaning that , unlike the newer campuses , which are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , King Memorial had to be converted over when the Isolation Principle went into effect . In this case , they had to move walls and shave a few feet from existing classrooms to create these claustrophobic passageways . " By the way , I 'm Roger Stenner , " he says , extending his hand . <p> " Dana Alexander . " She juggles a couple of books to return his handshake as they rush along . Her grip is remarkably firm . <p> " You owe me a cup of coffee , Dana . " <p> " Oh , really ? Why ? " He ca n't quite tell if she is annoyed or amused with him , although he is fairly certain that 's a smile she is trying to suppress . Either way , he 's getting a reaction . <p> " A word to the wise , since you 're new here . Our beloved Principal Ligotti likes to take these little ' inspection tours ' around the school , especially first thing in the morning . You know , on the lookout for really Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are running late ... " <p> " Oh , hell . Was he out there this morning ? " <p> " Do n't worry . I distracted him . " <p> " My hero . " <p> " Not really . He was just too busy chewing out my butt to notice you were there . " <p> She laughs as they reach the T-junction where they will separate toward their respective classrooms . " Seriously , Roger  --  thanks . I did n't need a slap on the wrist my second week here . " She flashes a smile at him over her shoulder as she walks away . " Nice to meet you . " <p> " So , about that cup of coffee  --  " he calls after her . <p> " Roger ! I 'm late . " She sounds exasperated . <p> " Hey , I 'm just as late as you are . How about meeting me in the staff lounge after Seventh Period ? " <p> She stops and gives him a quizzical look . " Are you sure about this ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Okay , then . " She is still giving him that enigmatic appraisal , as if suddenly recognizing him as a celebrity she can not quite place . " After school . " And she takes off . <p> Down the opposite end of the corridor , Stenner reaches the spiral metal staircase that leads to his second-floor classroom . Halfway up the rungs , he pauses to give her a last appreciative glance , and a voice directly below him says : " I 've seen that look before . Is it true love or just lust ? " <p> " What are you , McNeill ? Hall monitor ? " He looks down at the Math teacher 's balding and sunburned scalp . It annoys Stenner that a person who has his prep time during First Period  --  and thus , who could be late every morning  --  is the only teacher in the whole school who is chronically early . <p> " Sorry . " McNeill holds up his hands as he walks away . " You just did n't seem like the type . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that strange comment means ( the type for what ? ) , Stenner reaches the top of the stairs . <p> The Classroom : These days , teachers make theatrical entrances : stepping through the wall from hidden passages , rising up through the floor from trapdoors behind desks . Stenner has sometimes thought of appearing in a puff of smoke as he ascends into his classroom , but this current generation , raised on virtual reality and spazzjazz , probably would n't even understand the reference . Besides , the smoke would fill up the tiny plastic cubicle that contains his workspace  --  desk and computer terminal  --  with a choking cloud that would keep him from seeing their reactions . <p> Not that he can see them much better this morning : some smartass has sprayed his booth on the studentside with ugly and incoherent decorations , leaving a few gaps here and there for him to see through . Tagging , they used to call it . Now it 's called scars , and this example seems to consist mostly of gang signs and other territorial posturing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their territories , in his opinion  --  with a few choice obscenities written backwards for his benefit so that he can read them from inside the booth and thus enjoy their sentiments . <p> " Very funny , " he says through his speakers to the rising wave of hysteria in the room . Stenner can feel his lips compressing into a thin , angry line , but he carefully wipes all expression off his face as he drops his mirrorshades and briefcase on the desk and assesses the damage . Actually , he is surprised that the paint has n't already sloughed off the nearly-frictionless surface that was developed to cope with this decades-old problem . Thinking that maybe it is still fresh , he touches the keyboard command that will fire an electrostatic pulse through the bulletproof polymer and speed up the process of repelling the graffiti . <p> And nothing happens . <p> " It 's monobond , you jerk ! " a nasal voice shouts anonymously from the back , and the laughter explodes again , this time with an especially nasty undertone . Great . Stenner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint guaranteed to cover in a single coat , that works by literally becoming the surface to which it is applied . Neither cheap nor easily available , it certainly was n't bought at the local hardware store . Looks like somebody has jacked a construction site recently . <p> Why is it that every improvement in life just seems to give the punks a new weapon ? A sudden wave of disgust for a world where elaborate countermeasures are both necessary and so increasingly pointless threatens to sweep him away . Instead of surrendering to it , however , he sits down at his terminal , enters his suspicions in Security 's database and puts a red flag on it . Then he E-mails Maintenance regarding the ruined cubicle , though he will never lay eyes on a work crew during school hours . Only the Security chops would come in with students present , so he resigns himself to a day with limited visibility . In fact , he will be lucky if what is popularly known among teachers as " the shark cage " is replaced by tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very articulate , too . By the way , there 's no ' u ' in mother . " Sarcasm is lost on most of this audience , but it makes him feel better anyway . " Now , I want all of you to access page 134 in the textbook and do the interactive with me at the end , when you 've finished reading the chapter  --  All right , that 's ENOUGH ! " Suddenly , he thunders at them by cranking up the volume to a technically illegal level , cutting through all the noise and chaos . Instantly , the room quiets down into a sort of shocked , grudging silence . <p> He glares at them through the broken arms of a crudely drawn swastika . " Everybody in their seats  --  now , " he says at a more normal level , and most of them comply . " This means you , too , Mister Gorman . " " Hey , I still got business to conduct here . Do you mind ? " <p> " Tell it to the chops , Mister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stenner makes himself sound bored , but his hand hovers over the call-button , and the kid knows it . Finally , he struts back to his terminal and slouches defiantly in his seat , smirking and making comments under his breath that cause a ripple of smirks around him . <p> His point made , Stenner ignores them , and , realizing that the show 's over , the group regains some resemblance to an English class , though , as he slides into the rhythm of moving electronically from terminal to terminal , remotely checking each student 's work , correcting and commenting in real-time as he goes , Stenner feels an ongoing residue of emotions in the room , compounded of anger and unfocused hatred from some of them , frustration and boredom from others , contempt or amusement and especially much embarrassment over what happened . And fear . <p> It is an intoxicating mix , almost a palpable odor to him . It fades as the period draws to a close but is reflected in the quality of the work , all the way from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LaWanda Siddons at Terminal 17 , who made some genuinely insightful observations on Stephen Crane 's use of simile and metaphor . Stenner types a few , quick lines of feedback to her , wishing that he had time to give her more . <p> Wishing that he could talk to her face-to-face . Stenner only had one year of teaching at the beginning of his career before Isolation . Today he misses the freedom of that year more acutely than ever : the freedom to lecture without pacing back and forth behind a barricade , to walk among his students and ignite a rousing discussion , or to be close enough to actually see that lightning bolt of understanding in their eyes when they suddenly grasp an elusive concept . When they 've been struggling to understand something , and suddenly they Get It . <p> But that wo n't happen . The mechanics of the job are much different now , and the rewards are proportionately less . So the period ends , and he goes on with his day , which turns out to be a fairly commonplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear shots fired down the hall , and Security slaps a computer-lock on their door , but nothing significant comes of it . Just to be safe , Stenner keeps a closer eye than usual on the system-wide updates , but no deaths are reported on campus , and Intelligence assigns a low probability to the Violence Index . <p> In short , other than the graffiti in his classroom , a quiet day . <p> The Incident : Until the graffiti saves his life . <p> He never finds out what causes the battle . Perhaps it is related to those earlier gunshots , or possibly somebody is offended by the gang-signs that prevent his clear view of the room . Maybe he would have been able to see it coming with better visibility . Instead , all he knows is that open warfare erupts between two students during Fourth Period , the kind that often results in gunplay , accompanied by the usual screaming , ducking and panicked stampede  --  with an important difference . One of the combatants is armed with something much worse than a 9mm popper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction gear . <p> The kid has a laser spot-welder , modified for the street . It is a handheld job , pumped to deliver its entire charge in a single pulse , burning out the emitter in the process . <p> In other words , it only fires once , but that one shot can be lethal as hell . <p> If it connects , that is . The intended target flings himself over a desk , and the shot misses him completely . It scores a direct hit on the front panel of Stenner 's security-booth , however , which is directly in the line of fire . <p> Under other circumstances , Stenner would have been dead instantly . Instead , the monobond paint splashed across the plastic in front of him stops the beam for a heartbeat . He looks up in time to see a hot-spot flash incandescent in the paint a split-second before it burns through at chest level . What he does next has nothing to do with conscious reasoning , or even an awareness of what the flash means . It is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right thing to do to save his own life . <p> He grabs his mirrorshades off the desk and holds them up . Before they melt , their reflective surface scatters the laser back into the room , dazzling the students left in the front row . <p> The shooter gets the worst of it , though . Much of the coherent light bounces straight back at him , badly scorching his face . His hair bursts into flame , and he stumbles out the door , blinded and shrieking . He is already gone by the time the fire-control system kicks in , dousing everyone else and shorting out most of the terminals . <p> Excluding Stenner 's there in the cage . The general announcement it displays a few minutes later  --  that his classes are cancelled for the rest of the day  --  is overridden on his screen by an urgent personal message from Administration . <p> Stenner gets an old , funny feeling in the pit of his stomach . It has been many years since he was last summoned to : <p> The Principal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the publicity will . " <p> The damage control party in Ligotti 's office surrounds him like a tribunal of the Inquisition . Except that the clerics have been replaced by law-clerks and dogma by spin-doctors . Instead of heresy , they are looking for liability these days . And violations of political correctness , which is just a modem kind of dogma . <p> For a couple of hours , now , he has answered all their questions : Who started  --  ? When did you  --  ? What if you had  --  ? While throughout the interrogation  --  because that is exactly what it is  --  Principal Ligotti sits tilted back in his chair , hands clasped behind his head , staring at the ceiling . Listening to the frenzied debate with his feet up on the desk , legs crossed . Slowly , he wiggles his right foot back and forth , causing the artificial knee to make a scratchy , insect sound , rhythmic as a cricket . This twitch is the only barometer of the principal 's true agitation . <p> Stenner sees this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ligotti becomes , the worse it is . <p> " I was only defending myself , " Stenner says mechanically for the umpteenth time . " My God , it is n't like I planned to hurt the kid , " he adds this time around , but it is only a half-hearted protest . He is realizing that facts will have nothing to do with the outcome of this . <p> " You do n't understand our exposure , " the District rep tells him . He 's probably right . The political climate has been much different since the Crip Party won their majority in the State Legislature . <p> " You 're suspended , pending further investigation , " Ligotti says abruptly , dropping his chair legs back to the wooden floor with a thunk ! as final as a judge 's gavel . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Stenner , but I do n't see that we have any choice . " <p> Stenner does n't argue . Seventh Period has long since come and gone , and he excuses himself more with relief than with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he is going to pay the rent or pay for his own attorney , the only thing he can worry about right now is whether or not Dana Alexander waited for him . <p> The Teacher 's Lounge : Apparently not . <p> The only person in the lounge is a man that he does n't recognize : blond guy , slender , narrow features . Who can keep up with the turnover in this place ? <p> Then the guy says : " Roger ? " <p> " That 's right . " Stenner looks at him hard , wondering how he knows his name , wondering if he should recognize him , and then the light dawns . " Did Dana Alexander leave a message for me ? I guess she could n't stay , huh ? " <p> The blond gives him a quizzical look that is somehow oddly familiar , as if he has seen it before , just recently . Just today , in fact . On another face . <p> " Oh , shit , Roger . You did n't know . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dana ? But  --  but - you 're a Social Studies teacher ! " He blurts out the first stupid thing that enters his mind . <p> " Alternative Lifestyles Specialist , actually . " The other man smiles sadly . " I thought this was too good to be true . " <p> Stenner grins back sheepishly . " These things happen , I guess . " <p> " Are you disappointed ? " <p> " Oh , I 'm okay . " Stenner takes a step back , frantically searching for a graceful exit line from an embarrassing situation . " Trust me . After the day I 've already had , things could n't possibly get any worse . " <p> Departure : The police are waiting for him in the parking lot . <p> Late afternoon sun glints off the light-bar of the cruiser parked next to his old Quark . A few staff people stare as they go past , then hurry a little faster to their own cars . <p> One of the two officers  --  the older one  --  asks him his name and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reckless Endangerment of a Minor and Irresponsible Response to Violence , " he says and quotes the penal codes , though Stenner senses his reluctance with what he is doing . <p> " Officer , you know this is wrong . " Stenner is surprised at how calm his voice sounds . " The kid took a shot at me . " <p> The cop takes his arm and walks him a few steps away from the car . " Look , I 'm sorry , Mr. Stenner , but the boy 's parents filed charges . We do n't have any choice . " <p> " Christ , I 'm the one who should be filing charges . " But it goes without saying that he ca n't . They both know that Stenner signed the same waiver that every other public school teacher does when they take the job . <p> " All I can tell you , sir , is that it will look better for you if you cooperate . Personally , I would advise you to think about all the implications . " The cop jerks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar : That 's all I can say on the record , pal . So what is he really trying to tell him ? <p> Stenner follows the officer 's gaze down to the motorized barricade at the end of the access street , and it all becomes clear to him . <p> Suddenly , he is very aware of what might be waiting for him on the other side of that barrier  --  of how many friends the gang-banger in his class might have , and what they might be planning in retaliation . And where . And how leaving here in the company of armed policemen is , quite possibly , the only way he might leave here alive . <p> " I see what you mean , " he says and humbly , almost eagerly , extends his arms for the handcuffs . <p> Unlike his students , Roger Stenner learns his lessons . <p> <p> By Jake West <p>
