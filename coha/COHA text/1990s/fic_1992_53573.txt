After days of drifting , the man arrives at a confluence of doors . Had he been adrift on a river , instead of the ocean , it would seem as if he has encountered a logjam from some long removed past when the virgin forests were being dismantled . Had he been adrift on city streets , he might have come upon these doors hammered up into a makeshift barrier , a dead end walling off the wrecking site of a condemned neighborhood . <p> From afar , their surfaces shimmer like an ice floe . As he floats closer they appear like a sargasso of wood instead of weed , a gigantic deck without a ship , a floating graveyard where doors come to rest , undulating with the gentle roll of the sea . <p> The man rises unsteadily , shading his eyes , balancing his weight in the gently rocking life raft . From where he stands , the doors appear tightly butted against one another like pieces of a gigantic puzzle . He can see doors of all designs  --  plain and ornate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of them weathered . Some have peepholes , some have mail slots , some have numbers , foot plates , knockers , locks , doorknobs of brass , wrought iron , glass , and some have only puttied holes where the doorknobs are missing . He ca n't see any hinges . The doors are all floating with their outsides up , facing the sky , and their insides face down in salt water . <p> He paddles the raft along what seems the shore of a strange , uncharted island , and moors it , carefully securing the line to the knocker of what must once have been the stately door of a mansion . He bellies from the raft and stands accustoming his legs to bearing his weight again and to the slight roll . With each undalation of the sea a clear film of water washeds across the surface of the doors , glossing them like a fresh coat of shellac . As he walks he can hear the slosh of his cuffs and the creak of his footsteps on the warped wood . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nesting seabirds , sunning turtles , fish leaping up and plopping back at the edge where the water laps . He 'd hoped , at least , for the company of his shadow . After so many days at sea , he was looking forward to having a shadow again , a real shdow , with its long legs striding in time to his own . When he ca n't detect one , he is suddenly , inordinately disappointed . All that keeps him from weeping is his realization that , in isolation , his emotions have grown childish . He has begun each new day of drifting by promising himself that , whatever happens , he will not panic , and that promise now restores his composure . <p> He walks further inland , a single figure on a wooden plain , than whirls as if he 's heard someone following him . For a moment he could swear that he 's heard footfalls other than his own . Of course , there 's no one there ; just isolution playing its tricks . But , standing quietly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his quietly , he hears a sound that ca n't be water along the shoreline . He hears it again  --  a steady , nearly imperceptible knocking . <p> He proceeds inland and now not only can he hear the sound , but he can feel its vibrations through the soles of his bare feet . Each door he steps upon knocks back from the other side . From the elegant doors there comes a polite rap , from the ornate , stately doors , a firmer , more commanding knock , and from the threatens to build into an abusive pounding . <p> The farther he walks , the more insistent the knocking becomes . It is no longer restricted to the doors he steps on . The doors all around him have picked up the sound  --  each door with its own particular rap , its own pitch and rhythm , its own dema or plea , though he ca n't tell if he is hearing the blows of someone desperately trying to enter , or of someone locked in and trying to escape . <p> The barrage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiat landscape of doors trembles as if straining at hinges he ca n't see . He seizes the knob of a plain pine door and tries to yank it open , but it 's locked . He tries a charred-looking black door on which the darkened paint has been buckled by intense heat , a door that sounds ready to split under a rain of blows , but it is locked as firmly as if it has been nailed shut . <p> " Hello ! " he yells . " Who 's there ? " <p> There 's no answer except for the knocking , which becomes still more furious . <p> All the doors are locked . He knows that without trying them one by one . They are shut tight , as if the weight of fathoms , the pressure of a deep ocean trench , is holding them closed . And even amidst the pounding he has an odd flash of memory : how , as a child , he would tease his younger brother mercilessly , until his brother , who had a terrible temper , lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a hammer or a knife . He would run from his brother through the house , into the basement , and slam himself behind a shed door , holding it shut while his brother pulled furiously from the other side , shouting , " I ' 11 kill you ! " When he could n't force it open , his brother would expend his anger by hammering at the door , kicking it , hacking it , beating it with the bat , but they both knew that he would never get it open , and that they were both safe from the sum of his rage , and safe from facing each other . What would have happened , he wonders now , if just once he had opened the door his brother thought would never give ? <p> He remembers other doors he 's hid behind , and doors that he 's pounded on that remained closed . Perhaps it 's doors like those that have drifted until they 've gathered here : doors never opened , doors that remained mute and anonymous , doors slammed in faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors stripped of their privacy  --  pried , jimmied , axed . If not for the crescendo of knocking , he might lean his ear to each door and hear its story , listen to the voices muffled behind it , the singing or laughter or cursing or weeping , and perhaps he would recognize the voices he heard so that it would seem as if he were walking down a long corridor lined with all the doors of his life . <p> But by now the pounding has become too terrible for him to even consider listening for voices . It is a racket beyond control , rage or panic desperately unleashed , like someone beating at the lid of a coffin . He covers his ears . It seems impossible that the doors can continue to withstand such a battering . And if one of them should give  --  split by the fury of blows  --  would all the pressure from beneath come gushing through that single doorway , spouting like a monstrous wave into the sky , then storming down , crushing , drowning , sucking the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind ? <p> The vision terrifies him . He begins to run back across the doors , his footfalls drumming as he retraces his steps to the edge of the sea . Now it is as if all the various knocks have been reduced to a single , massive fist pounding as steady as a heartbeat against a single , massive door . Each concussion knocks him off his feet and sends him sprawling across the wooden surface . As he dreaded , he can hear the wood begin to splinter and a network of cracks spread as if it is ice rather than wood that he flees across . <p> At the edge of the doors , surf pounds in , in time to the pounding of the fist . The surge of breakers buckles his legs . He 's rolled back across the doors , then , caught in the backwash , sucked out towards the sea until the next wave sweeps him back again . He manages to catch hold of the knocker and he clings to it while waves slam over his body . With his free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knot to the line of the raft , while , at the other end of the line , the raft jerks and strains like a terrified dog at a leash . Finally the knot comes loose , and he times the backwash so that its momentum sweeps him into the raft . He 's thrown in on his face , water piling onto his back , while the raft bucks wildly in the surf , spinning away from shore . At any moment he expects it to capsize . <p> He is on the sea , drifting once more toward the horizon , staring out into a monochromic. blue , and not a bird in the sky . He paddles aimlessly , waiting for a current to seize the raft . Behind him , the doors gleam like a beach in the sun . They have fallen silent again . Whatever was awakened must be sinking back unanswered into dark fathoms . When he turns the raft for a final look , ripples slap the bow like the last reverberations of those desperate blows . <p> <p> By Stuart Dybek <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast of Chicago ( Vintage ) . <p>
