The rules of argument generally hold that you need three examples to prove your point . When yet another bomb exploded in Atlanta late last Friday night , this time in a crowded gay and lesbian bar , it was the third such incident in the past seven months . A particularly hateful and frightening point may have been made . <P> The explosion , which injured at least five people , follows the deadly Centennial Park bombing during last summer 's Olympics and the January bombings at a suburban family-planning clinic . As federal investigators began looking at evidence from the latest explosion , similarities with the earlier incidents were striking . When police arrived at the Otherside Lounge on Friday night , they discovered a second bomb in the parking lot . That was the same m.o . as in the abortion-clinic attack , when a second explosion injured rescue workers responding to the first blast , apparently by design . This time police were able to detonate the second bomb harmlessly . The bomb that did go off inside the club had been stuffed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park weapon . And the bomb found last week in the lounge 's parking lot was hidden in a backpack , as was the Olympic bomb . While the parallels were hardly conclusive , Atlantans awoke Saturday morning to face the possibility that their city harbored a serial bomber . <P> " This is eerily reminiscent of last summer and last month , " Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell told a press conference . " We clearly believe we are dealing with a deranged killer , but one who is very clever . " Investigators were somewhat more guarded . " We 're not ruling out the possibility of a serial bomber , " an FBI spokesman told TIME , " but it 's just too early to tell . " <P> With 150 or so patrons , the Otherside Lounge was half full when the latest bomb went off , without warning , shortly after 10 p.m . " Everybody just froze , " bartender Rhonda Armstrong told CNN . " It sounded like a cannon in a circus . " A rescue worker reported treating a woman with a nail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big as a nickel . " One victim underwent surgery at a nearby hospital and was said to be in stable condition . <P> Investigations into the earlier bombings do n't appear to be close to a resolution . Just two weeks ago , Jamie Gorelick , the Justice Department 's second-ranking official , told reporters that in the case of the Centennial Park bombing , " many leads that seemed hot ... have for one reason or another not panned out . " Investigators have reportedly been checking out a rumored link with a trio of Idaho men who were arrested for bombings in the Northwest , but no decisive evidence has been produced , at least publicly . To solicit more help , the FBI opened a toll-free phone line so potential tipsters can hear the 911 warning call that preceded the bombing . For now , separate teams of investigators from the FBI and the ATF will be looking into the nightclub and abortion-clinic explosions . <P> The bombings have one other thing in common : no one has claimed responsibility for any of them . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our place , " said Lynn Cothren , an Atlanta gay activist . Until investigators have a breakthrough or someone speaks up , Atlanta citizens can only wonder what kind of awful message is being sent to them . <P>  --  By Bruce Handy .
