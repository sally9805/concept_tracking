Fentriss sat up in his chair in the garden in the middle of a fine autumn and listened . The drink in his hand remained unsipped , his friend Black unspoken to , the fine house unnoticed , the very weather itself neglected , for there was a veritable fountain of sound in the air above them . " My God , " he said . " Do you hear ? " " What , the birds ? " asked his friend Black , doing just the opposite : sipping his drink , noticing the weather , admiring the rich house , and neglecting the birds entirely until this moment . " Great God in heaven , listen to them ! " cried Fentriss . Black listened . " Rather nice . " " Clean out your ears ! " Black made a half-hearted gesture , symbolizing the cleaning out of ears . " Well ? " " Damn it , do n't be funny . I mean really listen ! They 're singing a tune ! " " Birds usually do . " " No they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or six notes , eight at the most . Mockingbirds have repertoires that change , but not entire melodies . These birds are different . Now shut up and give over ! " Both men sat , enchanted . Black 's expression melted . " I 'll be damned , " he said , at last . " They do go on . " He leaned forward and listened intently . " Yes ... " murmured Fentriss , eyes shut , nodding to the rhythms that sprang like fresh rain from the tree just above their heads . " ... ohmigod ... indeed . " Black rose as if to move under the tree and peer up . Fentriss protested with a fierce whisper : " Do n't spoil it . Sit . Be very still . Where 's my pencil ? Ah ... " Half peering around , he found a pencil and notepad , shut his eyes and began to scribble , blindly . The birds sand . " You 're not actually writing down their song ? " said Black . " What does it look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now shut , Fentriss drew scales and jammed in the notes . " I did n't know you read music , said Black , astonished . " I played the violin until my father broke it . Please ! There . There . Yes ! " " Slower , " he whispered . " Wait for me . " As if hearing , the birds adjusted their lilt , moving toward piano instead of bravado . A breeze stirred the leaves like an invisible conductor , and the singing died . Fentriss , perspiration beading his forehead , stopped scribbling and fell back . <p> " I 'll be damned . " Black gulped his drink . " What was that all about ? " <p> " Writing a song . " Fentriss stared at the scales he had dashed on paper . " Or a tone poem . " <p> " Let me see that ! " <p> " Wait . " The tree shook itself gently , but produced no further notes . " I want to be sure they 're done . " <p> Silence . <p> Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales . " Jesus , Joseph and Mary , " he said , aghast . " It works . " He glanced up at the thick green of the tree , where no throat warbled , no wing stirred . " What kind of birds are those ? " <p> " The birds of forever , the small beasts of an Immaculate Musical Conception . Something , " said Fentriss , " has made them with child and its name is song  --  " <p> " Hogwash ! " <p> " Is it ? ! Something in the air , in the seeds they ate at dawn , some whim of climate and weather , God ! But now , they 're mine , it 's mine . A fine tune . " <p> " It is. " said Black . " But ca n't be ! " <p> " Never question the miraculous when it happens . Good grief , maybe those damned wonderful creatures have been throwing up incredible song for months , years , but no one listened . Today , for the first time , someone did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift ? " <p> " You do n't seriously mean  --  ? " <p> " I 've been out of work for a year . I quit my computers , retired early , I 'm only 49 , and have been threatening to knit macrame to give friends to spoil their walls , day after day . Which shall it be , friend , macrame or Mozart ? " <p> " Are you Mozart ? " <p> " Just his bastard son . " <p> " Nonsense , " cried Black , pointing his face like a blunderbuss at the trees as if he might blast the choir . " That tree , those birds , are a Rorschach test . Your subconscious is picking and choosing notes from pure chaos . There is no discernible tune , no special rhythm . You had me fooled , but I see and hear it now , you 've had a repressed desire since childhood to compose . And you 've let a clutch of idiot birds grab you by the ears . Put down that pen ! " <p> " Nonsense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're jealous that after twelve layabout year , thunderstruck with boredom , one of us has found an occupation . I shall follow it . Listen and write , write and listen . Sit down , you 're obstructing the acoustics ! " <p> " I 'll sit , " Black exclaimed , " but  --  " He clapped his hands over his ears . <p> " Fair enough , " said Fentriss . " Escape fantastic reality while I change a few notes and finish out this unexpected birth . " <p> Glancing up at the tree he whispered . <p> " Wait for me . " <p> The tree rustled its leaves and fell quiet . <p> " Crazy , " muttered Black . <p> One , two , three hours later , entering the library quietly and then loudly , Black cried out : " What are you doing ? " <p> Bent over his desk , his hand moving furiously , Fentriss said : " Finishing a symphony ! " <p> " The same one you began in the garden ? " <p> " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The birds , then . " Black edged closer to study the mad inscriptions . " How do you know what to do with that stuff ? " <p> " They did most . I 've added variations ! " <p> " An arrogance the ornithologists will resent and attack . Have you composed before ? " <p> " Not , " Fentriss let his fingers roam , loop , and scratch , " until today ! " <p> " You realize , of course , you 're plagiarizing those songbirds ? " <p> " Borrowing , Black , borrowing . If a milkmaid , singing at dawn , can have her hum borrowed by Berlioz , well ! <p> Or if Dvorak , hearing a Dixie banjo plucker pluck ' Goin ' Home ' and steals the banjo to eke out his New World , why ca n't I weave a net to catch a tune ? There ! Finito . Done ! Give us a title , Black ! " <p> " I ? Who sing off-key ? " <p> " What about The Emperor 's Nightingale ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Hitchcock . " <p> " Damn . How 's this : It 's Only John Cage in a Gilded Bird ? " <p> " Brilliant But no one knows who John Cage was . " <p> " Well , then , I 've got it ! " <p> And he wrote : " Forty-seven Magpies Baked in a Pie . " <p> " Blackbirds , you mean , go back to John Cage . " <p> " Bosh ! " Fentriss stabbed the phone . " Hello , Willie ? Could you come over ? Yes , a small job . Symphonic arrangement for a friend , or friends . What 's your usual philharmonic fee ? Eh ? Good enough . Tonight ! " <p> Fentriss disconnected and turned to gaze at the tree with wonders in it . <p> " What next ? " he murmured . <p> Forty-seven Magpies , with title shortened , premiered the Glendale Chamber Symphony a month later with standing ovations , incredible reviews . Fentriss , outside his skin with joy , prepared to launch himself atop large , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears . He had listened to the strange choirs each day for weeks , but had noted nothing , waiting to see if the Magpie experiment was to be repeated . When the applause rose in storms and the critics hopped when they were n't skipping he knew he must strike again before the epilepsy ceased . <p> There followed : Wings , Flight , Night Chorus , The Fledgling Madrigals , and Dawn Patrol , each greeted by new thunderstorms of acclamation and critics angry at excellence but forced to praise . <p> " By now , " said Fentriss , " I should be unbearable to live with , but the birds caution modesty . " <p> " Also , " said Black , seated under the tree , waiting for a sprig of benison and the merest touch of symphonic manna , " shut up ! If all those sly dimwit composers , who will soon be lurking in the bushes , cop your secret , you 're a gone poacher . " <p> " Poacher ! By god , yes ! " Fentriss laughed . " Poacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't arrive ! Glancing out at three in the morning , Fentriss witnessed a runty shadow stretching up , hand-held tape recorder poised , warbling and whistling softly at the tree . When this failed the half-seen poacher tried dovecoos and then orioles and roosters , half dancing in a circle . <p> " Damn it to hell ! " Fentriss leaped out with a shotgun cry : " Is that Wolfgang Prouty poaching my garden ? Out , Wolfgang ! Go ! " <p> Dropping his recorder , Prouty vaulted a bush , impaled himself on thorns , and vanished . <p> Fentriss , cursing , picked up an abandoned note pad . " Nightsong " it read . On the tape recorder he found a lovely Satie-like bird-choir . <p> After that more poachers arrived mid night to depart at dawn . Their spawn , Fentriss realized , would soon throttle his creativity and still his voice . He loitered full time in the garden now , not knowing what seed to give his beauties , and heavily watered the lawn to fetch up worms . Wearily he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prouty 's evil minions astride the wall , prompting arias , and one night , by god , perched in the tree itself , humming in hopes of singalongs . <p> A shotgun was the final answer . After its first fiery roar , the garden was empty for a week . That is , until- <p> Someone came very late indeed and committed mayhem . <p> As quietly as possible , they cut the branches and sawed the limbs . <p> " Oh , envious composers , dreadful murderers ! " cried Fentriss . <p> And the birds were gone . <p> And the career of Amadeus Two with it . <p> " Black ! " cried Fentriss . <p> " Yes , dear friend ? " said Black , looking at the bleak sky where once green was . <p> " Is your car outside ? " <p> " When last I looked . " <p> " Drive ! " <p> But driving in search did n't do it . It was n't like culling lost dogs or telephone-poled cats . They must find and cage an entire Mormon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hand is worth two in the bush . <p> But still they hastened from block to block , garden to garden , lurking and listening . Now their spirits soared with an echo of " Hallelujah Chorus " oriole warbling but to sink in a drab sparrow twilight of despair . <p> Only when they had crossed and recrossed interminable mazes of asphalt and greens did one of them ( Black ) finally light his pipe and emit a theory ; <p> " Did you ever think to wonder , " he mused behind a smoke-cloud , " what season of the year this is ? ' " Season of the year ? " said Fentriss , exasperated . <p> " Well , coincidentally , was n't the night the tree fell and the wee songsters blew town , was not that the first fall night of autumn ? " <p> Fentriss clenched a fist and struck his brow . " You mean ? ' " Your friends have flown the coop . Their migration must be above San Miguel Allende just now . " <p> " If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " <p> Another pained silence , another blow to the head . <p> " Shit ! " <p> " Precisely , " said Black . <p> " Friend , " said Fentriss . <p> " Sir ? " <p> " Drive home . " <p> It was a long year , it was a short year , it was a year of anticipation , it was the burgeoning of despair , it was the revival of inspiration , but at its heart Fentriss knew , just another Tale of Two Cities , but he did not know what the other city was ! <p> How stupid of me , he thought , not to have guessed or imagined , that my songsters were wanderers who each autumn fled south and each springtime swarmed north in a cappella choirs of sound . <p> " The waiting , " he told Black , " is madness . The phone never stops  --  " <p> The phone rang . He picked it up and addressed it like a child . " Yes . Yes . 0f course . Soon . When ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You see ? That was Philadelphia . They want another cantata as good as the first . At dawn today it was Boston . Yesterday the Vienna Philharmonic . Soon , I say . When ? God knows . Lunacy ! Where are those angels that once sang me to my rest ? " He threw down maps and weather charts of Mexico , Peru , Guatemala , and the Argentines . <p> " How far south ? Do I scour Buenos Aires or Rio , Mazatian or Cuernavaca ? And then ? Wander about with a tin ear , standing under trees waiting for bird-drops like a spotted owl ? Will the Argentine critics trot by scoffing to see me leaning on trees , eyes shut , waiting for the quasi-melody , the lost chord ? I 'd let no one know the cause of my journey , my search , otherwise pandemoniums of laughter . But in what city , under what kind of tree would I wander to stand ? A tree like mine ? Do they seek the same roosts ? Or will anything do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessing and come back with birdseed in my hair and bird bombs on my lapels . What to do . <p> Black , speak ! " <p> " Well , for one thing , " Black stuffed and lit his pipe and exhaled his aromatic concepts , " you might clear off this stump and plant a new tree . " <p> They had been circling the stump and kicking it for inspiration . Fentriss froze with one foot raised . " Say that again ? ! " <p> " I said  --  " <p> " Good grief , you genius ! Let me kiss you ! " <p> " Rather not . Hugs , maybe . " <p> Fentriss hugged him , wildly . " Friend ! " <p> " Always was . " <p> " Let 's get a shovel and spade . " <p> " You get . I 'll watch . " <p> Fentriss ran back a minute later with a spade and pickax . " Sure you wo n't join me ? " <p> Black sucked his pipe , blew smoke . " Later . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Too much . " <p> " Yes , but if it were here and the birds did return ? " <p> Black let out more smoke . " Might be worth it . Opus Number Two : In the Beginning by Charles Fentriss , stuff like that . " <p> " In the Beginning , or maybe The Return . " <p> " One of those . " <p> " Or , " Fentriss struck the stump with the pickax . " Rebirth . " He struck again . " Ode to Joy . " Another strike . " Spring Harvest . " Another . " Let the Heavens Resound . How 's that , Black ? " <p> " I prefer the other , " said Black . <p> The stump was pulled and the new tree bought . <p> " Do n't show me the bill , " Fentriss told his accountant . " Pay it . " <p> And the tallest tree they could find , of the same family as the one dead and gone , was planted . <p> " What if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What if it lives , " said Black , " and your choir goes elsewhere ? " <p> The tree , planted , seemed in no immediate need to die . Neither did it look particularly vital and ready to welcome small singers from some far southern places . <p> Meanwhile the sky , like the tree , was empty . " Do n't they know I 'm waiting ? " said Fentriss . <p> " Not unless , " offered Black , " you majored in crosscontinental telepathy . " <p> " I 've checked with Audubon . They say that while the swallows do come back to Capistrano on a special day , give or take a white lie , other migrating species are often one or two weeks late . " <p> " If I were you , " said Black , " I would plunge into an intense love affair to distract you while you wait . " <p> " I am fresh out of love affairs . " <p> " Well , then , " said Black , " suffer . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed slower than the hours , the weeks passed slower than the days . Black called , " No birds ? " <p> " No birds . " <p> " Pity . I ca n't stand watching you lose weight . " And Black disconnected . <p> On a final night , when Fentriss had almost yanked the phone out of the wall , fearful of another call from the Boston Symphony , he leaned an ax against the trunk of the new tree and addressed it and the empty sky . <p> " Last chance , " he said . " If the dawn patrol does n't show by 7:00 a.m. , it 's quits . " And he touched ax-blade against the tree-bole , took two shots of vodka so swiftly that the spirits squirted out both eyes , and went to bed . <p> He awoke twice during the night to hear nothing but a soft breeze outside his window , stirring the leaves , with not a ghost of song . <p> And awoke at dawn with tear-filled eyes , having dreamed that the birds had returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . And yet ... ? <p> Hark , someone might have said in an old novel . List ! as in an old play . <p> Eyes shut , he fine-tuned his ears ... The tree outside , as he arose , looked fatter , as if it had taken on invisible ballasts in the night . There were stirrings there , not of simple breeze or probing winds , but something in the very leaves that knitted and purled them in rhythms . He dared not look but lay back down to ache his senses and try to know . <p> A single chirp hovered in the window . <p> He waited . <p> Silence . <p> Go on , he thought . <p> Another chirp . <p> Do n't breathe , he thought , do n't let them know you 're listening . <p> Hush . <p> A fourth sound , then a fifth note , then a sixth and a seventh . <p> My God , he thought , is a substitute orchestra , a replacement choir come to scare off my loves ? <p> Another five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only tuning up ! <p> Another twelve notes , of no special timbre or pace , and as he was about to explode like a lunatic conductor and fire the bunch  --  It happened . <p> Note after note , line after line , fluid melody following spring freshet melody , the whole choir exhaled to blossom the tree with joyous proclamations of return and welcome in chorus . <p> And as they sang , Fentriss snuck his hand to find pad and pen to hide under the covers so that its scratching might not disturb the choir that soared and dipped to soar again , firing the bright air that flowed from the tree to tune his soul with delight and move his hand to remember . <p> The phone rang . He picked it up swiftly to hear Black ask if the waiting was over . Without speaking , he held the receiver in the window . <p> " I 'll be damned , " said Black 's voice . <p> " No anointed , " whispered the composer , scribbling Cantata Number Two . Laughing , he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . Legato not agitato . " <p> And the tree and the creatures within the tree obeyed . <p> Agitato ceased . <p> Legato prevailed . <p>
