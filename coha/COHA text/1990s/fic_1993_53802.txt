THE JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ETHNOGRAPHY , Vol. 31 , No. 6 ( Summer 1989 ) : 118-126 . <p> There was a beautiful young woman named Shining Agate , the oldest of three daughters , and she was very proud . Always , she insisted that her hair flaw loose and free of tangles , that her dress be sewn from the most supple skins , that the meat of her soup be tender and cut into very small pieces . To her parents ' eyes , Shining Agate could do no wrong , even in the smallest thing , and they never welcomed into their long-house anyone who suggested otherwise . As a result , Shining Agate grew up convinced of her own perfection , a conviction so powerful and sure that by the time she was twenty almost everyone in the village agreed with her . <p> Whatever special place Shining Agate preferred immediately became the most desirable spot to visit . Whatever flower made Shining Agate smile became the favorite blossom of every woman , old or still a child . Whatever song , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that song or tale or color became for a time the delight of the world . <p> Now it happened that there was a young man named Left Hand , who was the oldest of two brothers  --  his younger brother was named Right Hand . For as long as he could remember , Left Hand had dreamed that someday Shining Agate would consent to be his wife , but he was afraid to ask because of course he did not feel worthy of her . Certainly he was a good hunter , an excellent trapper , a weaver of tight , impenetrable fishnets . Certainly he was strong and robust . Certainly the mothers of many young women had invited him to sample the foods their daughters prepared , but none of those daughters interested him . Shining Agate was the only wife Left Hand desired . <p> " What can I do ? " he asked Right Hand . " How can I make her accept me ? " <p> Right Hand was a devoted brother and wanted to help , but to him Shining Agate was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her beauty was not that great , her ideas not that amusing , her smiles not that charming . It was as though Right Hand saw Shining Agate through a mist that obscured her brightness , and because of that , he judged her more clearly than anyone else . He did not find her a bad young woman , but he did consider her vain . Most of all , he hated for his brother to be so unhappy at Shining Agate 's expense . <p> " She is a woman the same as any other , just as you are a man the same as any other , " Right Hand told Left Hand . " Perhaps she will accept you , perhaps not . You will never know unless you inquire . " <p> Left Hand trusted Right Hand and listened to his advice . The next day , when he encountered Shining Agate playing stick games with her sisters , he took a breath and spoke to her . <p> " I have it in mind to marry , " he said softly . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Shining Agate looked up and noticed Left Hand as she never had before . He was tall and the sun danced on the blackness of his hair . His voice was frightened , his eyes bright , his skin without flaw . For some time she had wondered why no man had yet mentioned marriage to her when even women much younger had found husbands , and she felt a surge of gratitude toward Left Hand for removing this worry from her heart . She smiled on his question , and answered with the words he had hoped to hear . <p> " Of course , " she said without laughter , surprising her sisters . " You must only ask permission of the mother of the wife you prefer and I 'm sure she will agree . " <p> No sooner had the news passed through the village  --  for Shining Agate 's sisters were anxious to tell , glad to think of Shining Agate as married and out of their way  --  than people decided that Left Hand was truly an exceptional young man , even better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union , and were certain that it would produce many healthy children . No one was ever happier than Left Hand . <p> Yet soon after the marriage , Shining Agate experienced a curious change . Now that she found herself with a husband who approved of her every action , who complimented her sixteen times each day , who insisted upon repeating her every observation to anyone who would listen , and who felt so shy in her presence that he dared not touch her or ask anything of her without some prior signal that she welcomed the request , Shining Agate , for the first time in her life , became tired of praise . <p> Only occasionally at first , but ever more frequently , she intentionally tested her husband 's devotion . Some days she would not comb her hair with the hawk 's claw that made it smooth , but even then Left Hand would look at her and sigh : " How beautiful you are , Shining Agate . What a sunrise for my eyes . " Some nights as they lay together beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly asleep and then poke him sharply with her elbow or kick him with the heel of her foot . He would wake instantly , but instead of asking her to be still , he would say , his voice low and whispering , " How wonderful to be reminded that you are by my side . " Some days Shining Agate would boil the stew meat with salmonberry leaves , making it bitter and sour , but Left Hand would only flatter the taste . Some nights Shining Agate would push Left Hand away when he rolled against her in passion , but he would shut his eyes peacefully and dream of her instead . <p> " I would do anything for you , " Left Hand promised Shining Agate every morning . " No task is too large . " <p> Finally Shining Agate could endure her husband no longer . <p> " I have heard there is a pure white wolverine deep in the forest , " she told Left Hand : " Go seek it for me and do n't return until you can bring me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the doorway . It was early winter and the snows were already heavy upon the ground . <p> " Surely such an animal will already be asleep deep in its den , " he replied . " In the springtime I will trap it and make the hat for you myself " <p> " Wolverines do n't sleep in the winter like bears , " Shining Agate reminded him . " And I wo n't need a hat in the springtime . Go now . Find the pure white wolverine and do n't return without it . Was your promise a lie ? " <p> Left Hand gathered up his bow , his snowshoes , and his parka . " It was the truth , " he assured Shining Agate as he left the longhouse . <p> What Left Hand did not know was that Shining Agate had made up the story of the pure white wolverine . No such animal had ever been seen . <p> Days passed , then weeks , then months , and still Left Hand did not come back to the village . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slept on her back , and ate whatever and whenever she pleased from the ample provisions Left Hand had stored for the winter . Sometimes she did not think even once of her husband between sunrise and sundown , between sundown and sunrise , and tried to convince herself that she was again exactly as she had been before her marriage . <p> But certain things could not be changed back . When women of the village remarked to her that no wife had ever been so brave at the prospect of a lost husband , Shining Agate could not enjoy their words . When young men began to leave fine pelts and fresh moose meat by her door , she could not receive their gifts as her due . When her parents offered her comfort and sympathy , she could not bear their kindness . <p> Instead , she sought out the company of the only person who frowned whenever he beheld her , for Right Hand would not forgive Shining Agate his brother 's disappearance . <p> " Sister-in-law , " he said one morning as they stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water was drawn . " Is your head cold today ? Would the fur of a white wolverine keep you warmer ? " <p> Shining Agate saw herself through Right Hand 's eyes  --  selfish , cruel , and greedy  --  and it was as though a heavy cloak had.fallen from her shoulders and her arms were free to move . <p> " No condemnation you can say is bad enough for me , " she told Right Hand . The joy in her voice surprised him so thoroughly that he put down his oiled basket and stared at her face . <p> " Sister-in-law , " he tried again . " Have you not been sleeping well ? Your face is gray and older than I remember . " <p> " I do not deserve sleep , " Shining Agate replied . " I do not deserve to be called sister by the brother of my husband . " <p> " ' I am too harsh with you , " Right Hand apologized . " My brother will be angry when he returns . " <p> " He will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not harsh enough . " And with that she plunged her arm into the icy water , her face bright in pain . <p> " Shining Agate , stop this , " Right Hand cried , and pulled her up . He tucked her dripping arm inside his parka , hugged it against his chest to keep it warm . This touch was lightning in a summer sky , and soon it happened that every night Right Hand slept in his brother 's house , and Shining Agate never turned away from his embrace . <p> Even then the people of the village found nothing to criticize . " How appropriate , " they agreed . " The grieving widow is consoled by the loyal brother-in-law who fulfills his obligation . " But Shining Agate paid no attention , and one late night , after Right Hand was too in love with her to hate her , she told him the truth about the pure white wolverine and why he need not worry that Left Hand would come home . <p> A year passed , another , a further spring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who , like his father , reached only with his right hand . In the summer they moved to a fish camp down the inlet , and guarded by their secrets , the lovers made each day different and better than the one before . Laughter justified his name , and the cabin was filled with his merriment . <p> On the first day of the last summer moon , however , a rumor flashed through the village : Left Hand was on his way . <p> " How did he survive ? " people asked when they heard the news . <p> " He almost froze , " they were told . " He broke his leg in a fall and had made his death song when he heard wide-spaced footsteps . It was the Sesquatch , the bear people who lived in the world before human beings and who now dwell only in the highest mountains . They took pity on Left Hand and carried him back to their village . They used their ancient magic to set the bone of his leg , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even by the first summer , Left Hand was still too weak to return and so he stayed with the Sesquatch another year , hunted with them , became wise in their ways . When his full strength at last returned , he taught them human skills in gratitude for their hospitality , but their fingers were too blunt to tie sinew dense enough to catch salmon , so Left Hand stayed through the spring and early summer and left behind forty-eight nets of his own construction . The Sesquatch gave him as a sign of their friendship and appreciation a prize of great rarity : the pelt of a pure white wolverine . " <p> When Right Hand heard of his brother 's adventures his face turned to stone . Without speaking , he ran from the fish camp . Shining Agate grabbed up Laughter and rushed after him , but by the time she reached the beach , Right Hand had already pushed out his boat and was digging his paddle into the sea , heading toward the sun . <p> " Take me , take me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She held Laughter high above her head , but in his shame Right Hand would not look back . " You ca n't deny me . I will be too lonely , " Shining Agate cried , and stumbled farther and farther from shore . The water passed her knees , passed her waist , and finally it passed her shoulders until only her head and her arms , holding high her smiling son , were visible . <p> When it became clear to Shining Agate that Right Hand would not come back , that she must face Left Hand without him , her heart turned cold and smooth . She lowered her strong arms , sank Laughter deep beneath the waves , hugged him against her chest until he stopped moving . Then her own legs were caught by the undertow , and she disappeared . The surface of the ocean was once again empty and calm . <p>  --  AS COLLECTED FROM SERGEI MISHIKOFF , SUSCITNA , ALASKA , AUGUST 1970 " Sir , " the annoyed flight attendant addressed me . " This airplane can not move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was n't , and yet we were . I pleasantly pointed out this paradox to illustrate the capriciousness of codified law : what should n't be , nevertheless was . <p> She was not intrigued . " Sit , " she ordered curtly , and , faced with a direct command , I obeyed . <p> I was on my way to Alaska , propelled by inertia . Three years ago , I had enrolled in a graduate anthropology program , and , having taken the required course work for six semesters , it only remained for me to prove myself in the field . I had no ambitious queries of my own to resolve , so I appropriated one from my adviser , Abraham Wentworth . While passing through a remote subarctic village in 1927 , a question arose in his mind that he had never answered to his own satisfaction : Why did human beings remain in this remote , cold , barren environment ? <p> " Find out , " he directed me . " It 'll be good for at least a major publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stowed bags packed with painkillers and antiseptics , my sensitive film protected against weather by tied condoms , my future as a respected professional in the balance , aboard a flight diagonal across the continent . My fellow passengers were Japanese businessmen on their way home to Tokyo , healthy hikers , mothers grim-lipped from saying goodbye to their daughters-in-law and knowing , despite protests and promises , that their own solicitous faces would fade within a day from the memory of their drawling grandchildren . <p> It was one of those endless journeys in which all sense of from and to is lost , when secrets are confided to seatmates , great thoughts are pondered but not written down , plans are made that will never be carried out . It was a two-meal , two-hot-towel flight , a dislocating hang in the air , and by the hour I arrived I 'd be a time traveler : no longer truly from where I 'd started but not yet one with where I 'd come . <p> Once in Susdtna , I was given over to the care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults without taxing their patience . It took months for me to learn the rudiments of the language  --  the local dialect varied widely from anything previously published  --  and so I spent my first days shepherded by reluctant young boys or girls to whom parents had assigned the chore of my improvement . Aimlessly I followed one or another of them along the lanes of the community , pointing at objects and dutifully repeating the name to my instructor 's satisfaction before phonetically transcribing it into my notebook . <p> I had arrived in the early autumn , naively treating my stint of fieldwork as if it conformed to a standard academic calendar . Within weeks the sun all but disappeared from the murky sky , the temperature fell permanently below zero , and my child-hosts returned to their classrooms for hours each day . Time dragged , its waste insufferable whenever I imagined the activities I could engage in elsewhere , the conversations I could carry on , the tasks I . could accomplish . Winter was a long , insomniac night , featureless and infuriating , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My vocabulary lists lengthened , my hair grew , my connections to the world outside the village frayed and snapped . <p> One day in March , warmer than most , unable to endure the indoor boredom , I ventured out alone on a path bound high on either side by hard-packed snow . Turning a sharp corner , I saw in the gloom a deeper shadow , tall and menacing . The bear  --  it must be  --  hungry from hibernation , out , like me , for the first time . Running was pointless , so I did a thing I 'd read about : I dropped to the ground , shut my eyes , and lay completely still . A bear was supposed to believe me dead and therefore unappetizing or unthreatening , anything , to convince it to avoid me . My ears strained for the scrape of paws , the low rumble of a growl . Was it staring at me , transfixed in wonder ? Finally I opened one eye and found myself alone , the only spot of color in a vast whiteness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , failure , accident . I saw myself driving within a pointless life , defined by cautious habit , oscillating along the short curve between amusement and annoyance . It was as incorrect to say that nothing mattered to me as it was to claim that something did . At last , the cold penetrated my goosedown parka . I stood up , retraced my steps , went back inside . Two o'clock . In an hour , school would end and perhaps a child would be sent to visit . <p> I had been resident in Suscitna for eight months before I felt reasonably fluent . Even then , I had no choice but to frequently interrupt my eavesdropping with requests for repetitions , explanations , distinct pronunciations . I fit into no preestablished category within the existing social structure of the village , and so uniquely came to fill my own niche , a role approximately described as " nosy , inept , noncontributory stranger . " In the eyes of my informants it must have seemed as though I fairly panted for any scrap of simply expressed gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took delight in leading me astray , exhorting me to speak inappropriate words . I had no alternative but to become the butt of bad jokes , an irresistible buffoon , a moron who could be counted upon to laugh with the crowd at his own stupidities . How else to ingratiate myself ? Anger or resentment would have resulted only in an attitude toward me of indifference or scorn , and the thrust of my work depended upon access . And so I hid my true feelings , reserved my sarcasm and wit for letters that would be appreciatively read thousands of miles to the south , and bided my time . When this exile was over , my voice would be restored . <p> In the interim , there was the place . Denied the distraction of conversation , I had no choice but to interact with my surroundings , to open myself to their feel and sound , to the salt in the unflagging wind . After the months of darkness , the return of daylight was exhilarating , thrilling . The air smelled brown and green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each day farther from the shore , and beneath its transparent glare could be seen flashes of movement as insects skated the widening pockets . Roads turned to mud , mud to caked ruts . Men heated rocks for sweatbaths and children forgot their coats when they went out to play . At Easter a man , Ivan Kroto , went to church drunk . He sat and knelt and prayed loudly out of tune with the rest of the congregation , and no one minded . His behavior made them smile . <p> That summer , I moved from the village to an abandoned fish camp , where I lived alone in a tar paper-covered shanty perched high on a bluff , its one glass window fronting the blue-gray of Cook Inlet . From that solitary eye , one July dawn , I spied movement on the rocky beach and quickly descended the steps  --  planks pushed into the crumbling slope  --  to find a seal pup the tide had left stranded . It stared up at me , trusting and curious , too surprised at the firmness of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stroke its sleek fur . I kept it safe , protected from the sun by a crate , through the slow revolution of the sea 's cycle , and the next day it was gone . <p> I filled those hours I allotted to myself with projects and assignments . Each night , I would transcribe the notes I had collected , bits of new village trivia , emendations to previously recorded data , chance insights , lines of inquiry to pursue in the future . Most mornings , when the tide was out , I walked the beach , my eyes screening the pebbles for good luck . Among the dozens of locally identified charms , none was more prized than an opaque , soft , orange stone , slightly translucent when held before a light . Encased within , like the grain of sand around which in warmer oceans a pearl is formed , was a dark core of rock , and the smaller the heart , the greater the potency . I kept a collection in a mayonnaise jar on my table . <p> In winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat , muskrat , dried fish . But in the summer , I caught my own salmon with a nylon net I stretched between two barrels and anchored thirty feet offshore . First came the humpies , then kings , and reds , as run followed run . I supplemented my diet with boiled noodles , instant potatoes , Rice-A-Roni , or Hamburger Helper in a rotation of the six flavors stocked by the village all-purpose store . I drank tea , instant coffee , or Kool-Aid , watched the skies for the mail plane . Each night , I listened to country music on KYAK , or to the cassette tapes I had culled from my collection at home and brought north to keep me company . For society , I lost copiously but with forced grace at pinochle or cribbage , the village 's twin obsessions . For work , I amassed indiscriminate information from anyone I could persuade to talk tO rile . <p> Participant-observation is the name of the game in cultural anthropology , and accordingly I had apprenticed myself to Nike-for Alexan , the experienced fisherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village . With plywood , tar paper , a door , and a window ordered from Anchorage , I constructed a makeshift cabin on a fiat , cleared bluff a mile up the beach . <p> Nikefor , his wife , Madrona , their infant daughter , Mary , and Madrona 's father , Sergei Mischikoff , were a quiet family , traditionals who spoke no English and practiced a religion that combined old beliefs with the more recent teachings of nineteenth-century Russian Orthodox missionaries . <p> I was under no illusion that I was much help to Nikefor with fishing  --  an extra pair of arms , albeit clumsy and needing constant instruction  --  but for the group as a whole I believe I provided mild diversion . Though they rarely asked me questions about my background , they suffered my own queries with patience and good humor . In the evenings , during the preparations for supper , the mending of the nets , the sorting of the hooks , I was their excuse to repeat old stories and jokes , a fresh audience who never failed to signify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We were not friends , these people and I  --  too much divided us  --  but we grew used to each other 's presence , began to relax our respective guards . They knew by and large what to expect from me , and I had gauged , more or less , when to laugh . We shared food and labor , weather and isolation , and within the parentheses of the warmer season , we constituted a kind of unit . I felt myself part of a process I had read about in fieldwork courses : the researcher 's perspective shifts over the course of his investigation from that of a complete outsider to something approximating an insider 's point of view . Oddness is replaced by familiarity , novelty by routine . I had experienced the loneliness I had so dreaded in anticipating my stay in Suscitna , but over time the emotion had evolved and altered . Solitude became my most cherished companion , my trusted friend . After a long day of my own fawning , exhausting smiles , I sought it out . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea to seek for spawning the streams where they were hatched , and this season , as July turned into August , their appearance was behind schedule . The preference of the canneries , which were our prime source of cash income , an abundance of silvers was directly proportional to the village 's prosperity , and so we watched for them impatiently . <p> " They 're smart , " Nikefor commented . He sat in shirtsleeves at the table , a hand of solitaire dealt before him . He wore his dark hair long , combed to a ducktail in the back . " They 'll come at night when they think we 're asleep , or during a storm when they believe we wo n't take out the boat . " <p> Not sure whether to nod or smile , I lifted Mary out of her playpen and rocked her in my arms . <p> Madrona stood stirring an iron pot on the woodstove . When the water reached a high boil , she spooned in chunks of fresh fish , a can of green beans , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nikefor addressed me . " If the silvers come when I ca n't send for you overland , I 'll put the lantern on the boat . You come down from your camp and I 'll pick you up . " <p> The logistics of my living arrangement were a frequent source of worry for Nikefor . At high tide , the beach between our two camps was swamped under four feet of water , and the danger from bears was too great to permit passage along the top of the bluffs at night . He wanted me to sleep on his floor to ensure my availability the moment the run started . Every day , he tried to persuade me , but I refused to give up my few hours of privacy . <p> " Stay here tonight , why do n't you ? " he offered . " Look , the tide is already up to your ankles . You 'll get wet if you leave now . " <p> " I have my hip boots , " I reminded him . " I 'll watch for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madrona said . She reached her hand into a huge bag of dried potato flakes , came up with a fistful , and then dramatically tossed these into her stew . This technique was her specialty , a conjurer 's trick that both thickened the broth and created a skim of tiny dumplings . " This time of year those ghosts you are always asking about will come and get you if they find you walking alone at night . " <p> I looked over Mary 's head at Sergei , who made his eyes round in mock fright . My preoccupation with collecting ghost stories was a cause of much teasing . Grown men and women , it was implied , had more important things to think about . <p> The waves knocked at my knees as I sloshed toward my cabin . The night was moonless , overcast , with a promise of autumn in the , : hill air . I judged distance by the one constant marker located halfway along my route , a stagnant tidal pool that always stank of rotting seaweed . Once I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther ahead . <p> By the time I climbed them and closed my door , the Inlet had reached nearly four feet up the bluff . I could imagine Nikefor squinting into the night , frustrated and suspicious , wondering if the silvers would take this murky opportunity to evade his nets . I switched on my battery lamp , dropped a Roberta Flack tape into the player , and finished the day 's notes : N. bullshitting me about believing fish can think ? S. 's reaction suggests yes . M. warns me about bogeyman as she would a kid . Cross-check child abduction tale . Function : to keep people inside at night ? To instill group dependence ? <p> Roberta sang " Do What You Got ta Do . " I clicked off my lamp , lay on my cot , and zipped myself into my sleeping hag . Four months to go , minimum , before I left this place . I yawned deeply and turned onto my side . A few minutes later , the machine automatically shut itself off and I let myself be lulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching , approaching . <p> Suddenly I was alert , listening to light footsteps ascend the planks , reach the narrow porch . I waited for a voice , a knock , but . . . nothing . An animal , I decided once I thought about it . No one could have crossed the beach after me because of the deepening water . I must have been dreaming . <p> I recomposed myself , opened a gate for my mind to wander . <p> There it was again : footfalls , definitely . And there , I smelled the sour odor from down the shore , so it must be Nikefor or Sergei , come to tell me the salmon were making a dash for safe passage I heard a tap against the wooden door . <p> " Tinashdit-ah , " I spoke in Suscitna . <p> Another tap , soft as a branch moved by an evening breeze . <p> " Tinashdit , come in . " <p> No answer , but wait , I caught the unmistakable sound of stifled giggling . This was a joke , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bergunidge , the outsider , with his own research . <p> " Aikda , " I called . " I 'm already in bed . Pull out the latch string and come in before you fall into the water . " <p> A silence . . . then a loud rapping  --  bang-bang-bang-bang  --  but still no words . <p> " Please yourself , " I said . " But I 'm not getting up in the cold to play along . " <p> And all was still , utterly still . No retreating steps , no protests , no whispers . Through the four panes of my window glass , the stars were steady and familiar , balanced in their distant silence . I made a mental note to find out how Nikefor got from his camp to mine and , more importantly , to ascertain his motive . I had n't realized that my reactions mattered enough that he would risk getting wet to provoke them . <p> The tide was sufficiently out by 5 a.m. , and soon thereafter I sat in my place at the Alexan table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing in the Inlet to the hours between seven and four during silver season , and enforced the ruling by sending officers in small planes to overfly the beach in unpredictable patterns . <p> " Ya l'ida , how did you sleep ? " Madrona asked me . <p> " Ya li aleb , okay , once I was left alone . " I gave Nikefor a meaningful look . <p> " Left alone ? " Madrona was a good actress : her expression seemed genuinely puzzled . <p> " Ask your husband . " <p> Nikefor had been listening to the radio for the weather report , and glanced up . <p> " What I want to know , " I said , " is how you got from here to my place once the tide came in . How you got back home again . It 's a good trick . " <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> " I knew you 'd say that . " <p> I turned to Sergei , expecting a reciprocating grin , but his face was blank . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , and with as much sarcasm as I could muster in a language not my own , I told my story . <p> Nikefor , Madrona , and Sergei had stopped what they were doing and listened closely . <p> " You should have come in , " I finished . <p> No one moved , no one replied . <p> " Come on , " Nikefor said at last , and walked out of the cabin . Madrona wrapped Mary in a blanket and followed . Sergei splashed water on the fire in the stove and beckoned me to precede him down the stairs to the shore . <p> " Are we going to fish now ? " I asked , surprised that we had packed no lunch . <p> No answer . Instead , once we were all assembled below , the group began to walk the beach , past the empty boat , in the direction of Suscitna . <p> " What are we doing ? Where are we going now ? " <p> No answer . They were pointedly ignoring me , treating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But why , to what purpose ? After a while , we went past the stairs to my shanty without breaking stride , and a mile beyond we reached the next fish camp . Theodore Kroto and his teenage son Max had already loaded nets into their boat and were ready to push off . Wordlessly , the rest of us waited while Nikefor approached them . I could n't hear what was said , but saw Nikefor gesture back in the direction of our camps , saw the worry in his face . Theodore dug his boot into the sand , nodded once , twice , and finally , in what seemed like an attitude of resignation , threw the anchor from his boat . Max ran to their cabin , and in less than two minutes returned with his mother and younger brother . Quietly excited , they joined us as we resumed our march . <p> At each camp along the way , a similar sequence occurred . In some instances , boats already launched were summoned back to shore . Laundry was left piled half-washed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no one we encountered stayed behind , so that soon we were a ragtag crowd of maybe twenty-five men and women , children , babies , and a few trailing dogs . The only noise was the drum of our feet on sand and rock , the rustle of people in a hurry . <p> I was confused beyond anything I had ever experienced . To my knowledge , the forfeit of a fishing day was unthinkable , impossible . In Suscitna , what was n't caught and preserved in August could not be consumed in February  --  there were no second chances . As I kept pace between Sergei and Madrona , I considered every explanation for this trek , from sudden illness to my own abrupt eviction . Whatever was coming , I was without preparation or defense . <p> At last , just after noon , the straggling entourage arrived at the entrance to the tiny Russian Orthodox church in Suscitna . Father Peter Oskolov , part Native , though from a different community , listened to Sergei 's whispered news and disappeared into the sacristy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold ciborium in one hand and an ornate metal censer in the other . <p> I had long since given up asking questions , so I did n't try to catch his eye as we proceeded to the next stop , a log cabin without electricity or running water , the lifelong residence of the oldest woman in Suscitna . Martina Stephan was small and frail , her spine doubled over by osteoporosis . Balding and deeply wrinkled , she was never seen without a black shawl draped over her head . Like the subject of a Goya painting , her hands were forged by arthritis , twisted into attitudes of perpetual supplication . Her voice was harsh , rattling as wind through a gravelly passage , and her eyes were clouded white with glaucoma . She could not have weighed much more than eighty pounds . <p> " Grandmother , " Sergei shouted into her ear as we all stood watching outside the open door . " Bring your hat and come with us . We need you . " <p> Martina gravely dropped her head even farther than its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dark interior , where she rooted among boxes and bags stacked against the far wall . When she moved back into my field of vision , she clutched a small bundle wrapped inside a piece of faded olive-green army blanket . Bunky George , the manager of the store , pulled up in his Jeep , and Sergei and Nikefor lifted Martina into the passenger seat . The rest of us climbed into the beds of what seemed like every , pickup in the village , and in a long , jarring procession , we raced the incoming tide back down the rocky beach to the steps that led to my fish camp . <p> I jumped to the ground , made to go first . I could n't remember the condition of my room : Had I put away my notes ? Straightened my cot ? Neatness was a value among the Suscitna and I dreaded further embarrassment . <p> Sergei touched my arm . " First the priest and the old lady . " The fatherly , almost affectionate tone of his voice surprised me . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nikefor lifted Martina in his arms , carried her like a baby , and matched Peter Oskolov , plank by plank , up the side of the bluff . Madrona , Theodore , Sergei , and i came next , followed by what seemed like most of the population of Suscitna . When he reached the porch , Nikefor gently stood Martina on her feet and stepped back . to watch with the rest of us while Oskolov lit his incense and Martina , with jerks and fumbles , unwrapped the blanket . I smelled mothballs as the covering fell to the ground at her feet . <p> The priest began to chant in Slavonic , the words indistinct and rumbling , to swing the censer in an arc . Martina reached up her arms , pulled off her shawl , and set a hat made of fur on her smooth , shining head . The hat was grayish , fragile-looking , its shape flattened from storage and age , but here and there the pelage bristled magnetic , as if charged with static electricity . Wearing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last , " she said , loud and commanding . " I bring what you asked and now you must be content . " With that , unaided , she pushed open my door and walked inside . <p> All around me , I felt a relaxation of tension . The world rushed back to surround us the way a high wave rolls onto a dry beach : shoulders lost their hunch , mouths loosened into smiles , children whistled , babies cried , dogs barked , the long grass bent in the sea wind . <p> " Tonight you 'll make lots of tea , " Sergei whispered in my ear . " I 'll explain you your story . " <p> My work in Suscitna was different afterwards , in the six more months I remained . I had crossed a line , joined forces , been validated . People talked to me with less caution , and stopped playing tricks with vocabulary words . I was treated , I eventually decided , like a big , somewhat backward but favored child , a person who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of things , his sophistication , to catch up to where he should be . There was no lack of joking , no forced solemnity , but unmistakably a sense of acceleration . I was in demand , told what questions I should ask , quizzed the next day after an interview to ensure that I had grasped the significance of what had been conveyed . When fishing was over and we all moved back to the village , I had visitors or invitations every night . I absorbed more than I could record , gained impressions that could not be quantified , forgot my notebook more and more often . <p> And in exchange , my hosts and guests sought but a single courtesy from me , repeated so often it became a refrain : to recount my visit from lonely Shining Agate and Laughter . <p> " She needed you to let her in , " Sergei had pointed out that first night . " She required the door to be opened as her invitation . And just think , you would have seen her , her long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad . She would have told you how her son was drowning , asked for your help , and of course you would have gone . Like many before . . . but see , you turned out to have more power than we thought . " <p> " More power ? " I asked him . " Why do you say that ? All I did was stay in bed . " <p> " Yes , " he nodded , his face lit and pleased . " Think how unusual a thing that was for you Always you are so anxious to indulge us . You jump when we call . You laugh at your own errors . You give away your possessions and ask for little in return . But last night , grandson , you were rude ! That was your power ! You are the man who did n't answer , the man who resisted Shining Agate , the man who at last released her by saying no .
