A tennis great , felled by a stroke , makes a stirring return from the brink Photograph " Rod 's a fighter , " says Mary , his wife of 32 years . " He does n't give up on anything . " // When Mary Laver got the call from her son Rick on July 27 , she was incredulous . " Mom , Dad has had a stroke , " said Rick , 29 . " Whose dad ? Not your dad , " she responded . " He 's too healthy . " The reaction was understandable . Her husband is Rod Laver-known as Rocket , for his blazing speed on the court when he tore through the tennis world in the ' ' 60s and ' ' 70s . The only player to win two Grand Slams in his career , sweeping all of a year 's four major tournaments , at 59 he still weighed only 170 lbs. , ate a low-fat diet and played golf and tennis . Though his brother Bob had died of an aneurysm at age 48 , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite his wife 's disbelief , Laver had indeed suffered a moderate hemorrhagic stroke . ( Hemorrhagic strokes , caused by a burst blood vessel , account for about 15 percent of all strokes ; ischemic strokes , which usually occur when a blood vessel is blocked by a blood clot , account for the rest . ) About 700,000 Americans suffer strokes every year , and of these , 150,000 die . When stricken , Laver was taping an interview for ESPN 's SportsCentury at a hotel in Westwood , Calif . Rushed to the Stroke Center at the UCLA Medical Center nearby , he was treated by doctors of the " brain attack " team . After 13 days in intensive care , during which his condition was stabilized , Laver went on to spend 2% weeks in therapy and was released from the hospital Aug. 27 . Though still suffering some paralysis on his right side and still slightly speech impaired , Laver is recuperating at his home in Rancho Mirage , Calif . That 's where he shared the story of his stroke - and his remarkably rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way through the interview , my leg felt numb , and then I felt my hand and my fingers were cold and numb . It was like if you 'd slept on your arm . There was no pain ; it did n't dawn on me that I was having a stroke . I got up and I fell , but one of the camera crew caught me . Alex Gibney , the interviewer , called for an ambulance . I could n't remember our phone number to let Mary know . I remember the paramedics wheeling me through the hotel , but I really do n't remember very much after that point . A stroke does n't let you think , as I 'm finding out . The first time I recall Mary coming in , she had a big hat on . It must have been at six days . I certainly remember my son Rick being a great help . He 'd been away and out of the house for years , so it was nice to have him by my side . I think the family 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always around at the hospital , in the room . They brought up the cards-birthday cards and get-well cards-and I saw there were a lot of them . My stepdaughter Anne put them in volumes . They tell me that I was talking , gibbering away in some type of language they could n't understand . I 'd feel like I 'd made a wonderful statement , and they 'd acknowledge that I 'd said something wonderful , but it did n't make any sense at all . The doctor asked Mary if I had ever studied Latin . It was only when I had gotten out of the ICU that they started therapy . The therapy goes from getting out of bed and brushing your teeth to putting on a pair of shorts . Speech therapy started fairly soon ; occupational therapy came later . The first day or two , they just wanted me to remember things . What was my age ? What was my name ? Who 's the President of the United States ? I knew these things , but the right words would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a clock on the wall , and I could n't read it . I remember when the therapist came in and I pointed to her watch , but I said glasses instead . Then I realized that if I 'd slow down before I spoke , the right words would come out . After that they had people come by to make me write . I could n't really write ; I was copying . I 'd try to write " cat " and it would come out " c-c-a-a-t . " We 'd go back through the words , and they 'd say , " What do you think you wrote here ? " I knew I had to start all over again . There 's no use being frustrated about it . Photograph " His strength , " says tennis 's Don Budge of Laver ( in ' ' 62 ) , " was he had no weakness .

The occupational people would come down and get me to try to stand behind the walker-not push it but just stand and get my balance . I banged my right arm a bit because it 's numb and I 'd forget it was hanging outside the wheelchair . At one stage I wanted to know if I could get back and start playing tennis . So they wheeled me down , and I was standing up outside , just away from the wheelchair . One physical therapist would sit in the wheelchair and grab my legs and the back of my belt , and I 'd get out there and hit the ball . It felt great . I 'd been fed intravenously while I was in the intensive care unit , and I remember asking , " When do I get something to eat ? " They said no , you ca n't have food because your whole right side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good hospital meals-pasta probably . They stayed there with me the first meal , watching to see I did n't choke . They kept asking , " Are you chewing enough ? " When I came out of the hospital , my legs looked like little beanpoles , atrophied down . I was 138 when I left the hospital , and I 'm normally about 170 . I knew I had a lot of recovery to do . Most times I exercise in the kitchen where the floor is tiled . The therapist always says do n't try to do too much-you 'll get tired very quickly just talking to people , watching television . But I did watch the U.S. Open . I was thrilled when Patrick Rafter won again . And Pete Sampras called me . It 's nice to hear from people like that . Mentally it does help . I think the biggest problem in recovery is balance , but because I was an athlete , I have pretty good balance , maybe better than the average person . After a few days at home I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to using my golf putter as a cane . One day my therapist said , " Why do n't you walk over there without it . " That was a great feeling , just being able to walk here and back on my own without a walking stick . I remember putting it on my calendar : " I walked today . " I 'm still numb on the right side , but the good part is that I can move . Being left-handed , I still have full use of the left side . They say that I may get full feeling in my right arm and leg , but no doctors will give any guarantees . Some people will get a full recovery ; other people get to the point where they have some feeling but not all of it . You just do n't know . Fortunately I can walk , although I have to watch where my right leg is all the time . I think having a stroke makes you appreciate the things you have , your health certainly . You do n't know how fragile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the training technique to start againwhether it be telling time , writing or remembering my telephone number . My goals ? I 'm not going to accept that I ca n't play tennis again . I 'm going to work until I can .
