Liberals and conservatives are both wrong about the death penalty <p> IN THE LONG-RUNNING BATTLE OVER America 's death penalty , two trends have emerged to stoke passions on opposing sides of the debate . An alarming number of men  --  82  --  have been freed from death row , or about one for every seven executed . At the same time , the rate of executions has slowed to a trickle as death row inmates languish on average for more than a decade before their sentence is carried out . Two recent examples bear out the problems in our current capital justice system . <p> In 1978 , Robert Alton Harris , a 26-year-old paroled murderer , kidnapped two California teenagers in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant . He drove to a remote canyon where he killed the two boys , then finished the hamburgers they 'd been eating and drove off . Harris was later caught robbing a bank . He confessed to the murders and was sentenced to death in 1979 . Yet he managed to delay his execution for 13 years by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenged the quality of his psychiatric evaluation , claimed California 's gas chamber was unconstitutional , and argued that the death penalty discriminated against younger killers , males , and those who killed whites . Each of these claims stalled his execution . In a flurry of last-minute appeals , the Supreme Court overturned four separate stays on the night of Harris ' execution before it took the unprecedented step of forbidding lower courts to issue further stays . By the time he was finally put to death in 1992 , Harris had managed to get more than 20 appeals . <p> Like Harris , Aaron Patterson 's case centered on a murder confession . He was subsequently sentenced to death for the 1986 stabbing deaths of an elderly Chicago couple . But Patterson is one of Illinois ' " Death Row 10 , " a group facing execution who claim their confessions were beaten out of them by a notorious Chicago police lieutenant since fired for abuse and torture . No physical evidence connects Patterson to the murders . The knife was never found . A fingerprint at the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lone witness against him , a teenager who claims police coerced her testimony , has tearfully recanted . <p> While Harris is a metaphor for the conservative case against the current capital justice system , Patterson 's case has been seized upon by abolitionists . Both are justified in their outrage . More than 20 years after its reinstatement , the death penalty is an unwieldy and ineffective compromise between the roughly 70 percent of Americans who favor capital punishment and the minority who fiercely oppose it . The present system is , quite literally , the worst of both worlds . While an ideological battle has been waged in court , a bottleneck has developed in the nation 's prisons . Currently , 3,565 inmates sit on death row , and new arrivals average 300 annually . Yet despite rising numbers of death sentences , executions have never topped 100 in a single year . Everyone is being sentenced to death and no one is dying . Death Born Again <p> In the landmark 1972 case of Furman vs . Georgia , the Supreme Court struck down the death penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfairly against minorities and the poor ; its infrequent use made it an ineffective deterrent ; and lastly , state-sanctioned killing was no longer acceptable behavior . The decision resulted in tremendous uncertainty . Each justice filed a separate opinion , an unprecedented move in 20th century jurisprudence , yielding the longest written decision in Supreme Court history . The length is indicative of the decision 's complicated rationale . While the case for abolition earned the five votes necessary , the motivation for each vote varied . This uncertainty left the door open for states to write new death penalty laws that might pass constitutional muster . <p> Abolition was never very popular . Polls taken in March 1972 , shortly before Furman was decided , showed a 50 percent approval rating for capital punishment ; that number jumped to 57 percent by November . Within the year , 19 state legislatures passed retooled death penalty statutes they hoped would meet the vague standard of constitutionality hinted at in Furman . By the time the Court allowed the modern death penalty by upholding Gregg vs . Georgia in 1976 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in dispute ever since , and the result is today 's beleaguered system . <p> Shortly after Gregg , the court acceded to death penalty opponents by outlawing mandatory death sentences and instituting complex safeguards . This gave rise to a problem that still hampers the courts : Unable to abolish capital punishment in the legislature , defense lawyers have sought to institute a de facto halt to executions by stalling cases in court . The more savvy , like Harris ' lawyers , quickly mastered the art of " sandbagging , " or using delay tactics to stop an execution . By filing spurious last-minute appeals and repeatedly seeking reversals on obscure technical grounds , activist lawyers ( and some judges ) could bring the system to its knees . Angered by this end run around the law , conservatives have limited the appeals process at the state and federal levels and expanded the scope of crimes punishable by death . The unfortunate result , as federal prosecutor David Lazarus wrote in this magazine last year ( " Mortal Combat , " June 1998 ) , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of actual executions to a trickle . The average delay from sentencing to execution has grown from six years in 1985 , to eight years in 1990 , to 11 years today . The Art Of Delay <p> Delays in death penalty cases are caused in part by the tacit acceptance of such maneuvers by liberal judges . The most famous examples are former Supreme Court justices William Brennan , Jr . and Thurgood Marshall , who voted against every death sentence that came before them . Recent limits to federal appeals should eventually block some avenues for delay . But as old methods are thwarted , new ones crop up . Kent Scheidegger , legal director for the conservative Criminal Justice Legal Foundation , cites as an example an increase in the use of " Ford claims "  --  assertions that a prisoner has gone insane since sentencing and therefore ca n't be executed under the Eighth Amendment . ( This is a particularly savvy ploy , because arguing that insanity occurred after the trial phase means the claim is n't subject to a limit on appeals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulation are Marsden and Faretta motions , which a defendant can use to fire his lawyer and represent himself . In a notorious California capital case , the defendant filed numerous such motions , going so far as to sue two court-appointed defenders for $1 million in an effort to delay his sentence . Common sense need n't be a requirement for a claim  --  a Montana prisoner , who 'd held off his execution through two decades of appeals , finally argued that the length of time he 'd had to endure on death row was unconstitutional . <p> Though liberals are commonly faulted for delays , conservatives also slowed the process by making access to court-appointed attorneys more difficult for the poor . In 1995 more than a quarter of California 's capital defendants did n't have a lawyer and their cases could n't begin until one was assigned . And , with conservative anger buttressing support for prosecutors ' win- at- all- costs attitude , unscrupulous prosecutors regularly tie up capital cases by fighting defense requests for information . Innocence Expired <p> The unfortunate response to dilatory tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time limits . Thirty-six of the 38 death penalty states impose deadlines for presenting new evidence following a conviction . The strictest such law is Virginia 's notorious " 21-Day Rule , " which limits the introduction of new evidence to 21 days after trial . Other states have similar limits that range from 30 days to a year . These laws were intended to establish finality in all criminal cases and most predate the modern death penalty . But they have recently been championed by conservatives as a way to combat delays in execution , despite the obvious risk they carry of killing or imprisoning innocent people . <p> In recent years , the law 's shortcomings have become apparent . Virginia 's 21-Day Rule , for example , forbids new DNA evidence from being introduced more than three weeks after trial . And , amazingly , the law does n't even make provisions for illegally suppressed evidence  --  such evidence is considered " new " in Virginia and therefore is inadmissible . ( A prisoner would instead have to file a federal appeal . ) The problem was ably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia legislative committee : " After 21 days , no court in this state , nor any judicial forum afterwards , can save you from execution based on the proof that you are innocent " <p> The circuit court that oversees this system  --  referred to locally as " the rocket docket "  --  has succeeded in speeding the processing time of death penalty defendants . Capital cases in Virginia move much more quickly than they do elsewhere . But the results come at a price . One of the most controversial examples is the case of Earl Washington , Jr. , a mildly retarded man sentenced to death for the 1982 rape-murder of a Virginia woman . A concerned prosecutor later ordered DNA tests , unavailable at the time , that provided strong evidence Washington is innocent . But because the evidence appeared after the 21-day deadline , Washington had no avenue for appeal . The only recourse for a prisoner with exculpatory evidence is gubernatorial clemency . But governors are n't part of the judiciary and ca n't order a new trial . And of course they 're heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his term , Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder commuted Washington 's sentence to life in prison . But with no judicial outlet to order a new case , Washington remains in prison . <p> Such problems are exacerbated by the fact that many prisoners ca n't find attorneys for post-conviction hearings  --  in 1995 Congress eliminated the resource centers that once provided them . Without an attorney , the possibility of correcting a mistake like the one in Washingtons case all but disappears . State post-conviction review is the first opportunity to present claims of ineffective counsel and the last chance to investigate claims like actual innocence and prosecutorial misconduct . Ironically , the Supreme Court has affirmed that indigent death row inmates have a right to counsel at federal appeals . But without a lawyer at the state level , their claims will doubtless never make it that far . Fools On The Hill <p> While state legislatures have failed to improve the system , reforms at the federal level have also been woefully misguided . In the mid-1980s federal judges could n't find enough qualified lawyers to handle death penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't necessarily provide competent counsel . So in 1988 , at the behest of federal judges , Congress created legal resource centers to process and defend the poor . By most accounts , these centers served their purpose . <p> But in the tough-on-crime environment of the early ' 90s , the centers became a political football . Congressman Bob Ingis ( R-South Carolina ) branded them " think tanks for legal theories that would frustrate the implementation of all death sentences " In 1996 , citing fiscal priorities , Congress eliminated federal funding for resource centers  --  $20 million for 21 centers nationwide . Budget hawks figured they 'd won a double victory . They reasoned that by choking off agencies that represent death row inmates they 'd rid themselves of an impediment to executions , while saving taxpayers millions in the process . <p> That thinking backfired . A critical function of resource centers  --  one intended by federal judges  --  was to keep the appellate system functioning smoothly . With organizational support , full-time lawyers kept tabs on death row cases , filed appeals promptly and steered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant indigent defendants did n't require the court 's help . The infusion of lawyers trained in capital cases helped offset the costly and often inexperienced court-appointed lawyers who otherwise handled capital cases . Resource centers were a government program that worked . So their elimination had the opposite of the intended effect  --  it slowed the pace of appeals and increased the likelihood of error . <p> Other measures were similarly misguided . In 1994 , by threatening to block the federal crime bill , congressional Republicans forced passage of the Federal Death Penalty Act , making 54 new crimes death-penalty eligible . The law was largely a symbolic measure  --  there had n't been a federal execution in 31 years . Yet death-penalty offenses suddenly came to include drug dealing crimes , conspiracy to commit murder even if no murder was committed , and such rarely committed crimes as murder of a federal poultry inspector . The broadened scope only added to the courts ' burden . Federal death sentences soared from 28 the year before the law , to 153 in 1997 . Even conservatives thought the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough , " said Scheidegger . " Congress enacted a long string of federal death penalty crimes , most of which are entirely unnecessary , so that they could go back and claim to be tough on the death penalty . It was a rather cynical ploy . " <p> Cynical but costly . Last fall , a judicial conference report determined the average cost of prosecuting a federal death penalty case to be $365,000 . The same case cost $218,112 to defend . But if a sentence other than death were sought , the defense costs dropped to $55,772 . Factored out for the additional convictions , that 's a $73 million price tag on a measure that did little more than let congressmen flex their muscles . <p> Congress responded to the Oklahoma City bombing with its most ambitious reforms to date . The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 limited to one the number of appeals a prisoner could file in federal court , barring exceptional circumstances , and placed a one-year time limit on their ability to do so . Conservatives believed this would eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in disposition shall be permissible because of general congestion of the court 's calendar , " the law read . <p> But like earlier efforts , the Act 's aim was largely misdirected  --  a disingenuous marriage of death penalty and terrorism law that represented a large political compromise . Sponsors touted a connection between terrorists like Timothy McVeigh and speedier laws which , they suggested , would bring criminals to justice . The bill was rushed to passage before the first anniversary of the bombings . But the death penalty " reform " on which the law hinged mainly affected state court cases , where the overwhelming majority of death row inmates are sentenced . Terrorists like McVeigh are prosecuted in federal court . Problems At The Source <p> If one source of the problem is in congress , another is at the local level where most death penalty cases originate . Here , too , there is need for reform . The rate and effectiveness with which the death penalty is used varies drastically from states like Ohio , which has executed just one person since reinstatement , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 44 percent of all executions ) . In recent years , the scrutiny surrounding cases like Aaron Patterson 's has made Illinois ground zero for the death penalty debate . The state 's 12 exonerations are symptomatic of the problems in the way cases are prosecuted and defended . <p> Patterson 's case illustrates many of these problems . To begin with , he was represented by public defenders and was therefore an easier target . Numerous studies have shown that public defenders often lack the skill , resources , and commitment to defend capital cases properly . Not surprisingly , 90 percent of current death row inmates did n't have a private attorney . As prosecutor David Lazarus has noted , " Clients of the world 's great defense attorneys ( and even the good ones ) do n't receive death sentences . Almost without exception , a prerequisite for receiving a death sentence is the inability to hire a lawyer sufficiently talented or motivated to mount a credible defense " Public defenders , he continues , will " substantially increase the probability that a defendant will be convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Overzealous prosecutors are another problem . Tenet number one for the career-minded prosecutor is " get tough on crime . " While ambitious prosecutors often tout their death penalty convictions , they 're far less likely to question whether such convictions are cost effective or necessary . The number of death sentences later reversed suggests that in many cases they 're grossly unfair : 40 percent of death row cases are vacated at some point in the appeals process . This can occur ten or even 15 years down the line , at enormous cost to taxpayers and tremendous injustice to defendants . But as a rule , prosecutors do n't abandon death penalty cases for fear of appearing soft on crime . Federal judge Alex Kozinski has pointed out that while 80 to 90 percent of all criminal cases end in plea bargains , capital cases almost always go to trial . There is little justification for this discrepancy , given that plea-bargaining death penalty cases would limit costs and nullify the issue of protracted appeals . <p> The tough-on-crime mentality also infects state lawmakers who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty crimes . Illinois , which in 1977 had seven crimes that qualified for death , today boasts 19 . Often , new additions are an ill-considered reaction to high-profile crimes like last year 's murder of a neighborhood activist in Chicago , which prompted legislators to make killing an activist a death penalty offense . Such moves are well intentioned but only hamper an overburdened system . <p> Prosecutorial excesses also run up costs . While defense lawyers are commonly faulted for delays , prosecutors share the blame . Because of their never-say-die attitude toward upholding convictions , they often drag their feet when exculpatory evidence raises questions of innocence . Prosecutors fought to prevent DNA testing that ultimately freed Ronald Jones , the last man to walk off Illinois ' death row . Jones spent nearly two years on death row after tests proved his innocence because prosecutors were unwilling to abandon their case . <p> In fairness , Illinois has taken steps to address the most serious shortcomings , and other states would do well to follow its lead . Recognizing the need for adequate representation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' legal resource center when federal funding ended . The result is the Capital Litigation Division of the Illinois State Appellate Defender 's Office , essentially a state-funded resource center . <p> Illinois also joined New York in passing a provision for post-conviction DNA testing . The law acts as a safeguard against mistaken convictions by allowing inmates to petition for DNA analysis of evidence used to convict them . No other state has used DNA to uncover more wrongly convicted defendants than Illinois . Perhaps most noteworthy in the near term is Illinois ' activist community . It has played a part in freeing all of the 12 released death row inmates and forced many of the positive changes in the criminal justice system . <p> Finally , most of the state 's major media outlets have given nuanced coverage to death penalty law and have provided detailed reporting on flaws and abuses . This is in marked contrast to the national media , which eagerly covers high-profile exonerations but shies away from stories that do n't rise to the level of a 60 Minutes piece . Consider , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Aaron Patterson and Northwestern University professor David Protess ' efforts to free him . " The Newsweek article had by my count and my students ' count 21 factual errors in three pages , " Protess says . " In the entire time that I 've been involved in this , I 've never seen an article more off-base than that . " The author wrote that Patterson " consented to an oral confession , " which he did not . She also wrote that the jury " found it hard to believe that Patterson , the son of a Chicago police lieutenant , would be mistreated . " In fact , the jury never heard any evidence of physical abuse , thanks to a pretrial ruling . If journalists were to cover the death penalty as thoroughly as they 've covered welfare reform , such carelessness would be less common , and the shortcomings of the death penalty system would be a far more prominent public concern . On The Merits <p> Pragmatism should eclipse the battle between the extremes of liberalism and conservatism that have reigned on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processing time adequately , the solution is to reduce the number of death sentences handed down . The first step is to provide resources for the system to function properly , then to enact laws that ensure it does so in a timely manner . Improvements should begin with the resurrection of legal resource centers . Qualified resource center attorneys would prevent prosecutors from running up capital convictions against unprepared or unqualified public defenders . In fact , the motivation for ambitious prosecutors would shift from quantity of convictions to quality . They 'd need to be certain of an airtight case before seeking the death penalty , since failing to win a conviction is a political embarrassment . This might even have the secondary effect of removing the stigma attached to settling dubious capital cases . <p> Resource centers would have a trickle-down effect that would alleviate problems later in the justice cycle : only the most deserving killers would be executed ; more convictions would be upheld ; having competent lawyers at trial would eliminate the claims of incompetent counsel that delay so many cases today . Cases would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years for the court to assign them an attorney . And fewer convictions and appeals would curtail the staggering cost to taxpayers . <p> Even the most conservative estimate of savings is substantial . Federal Judge Kozinski estimates each death penalty case ( in state court ) costs taxpayers $1 million . If each case were thought of as a million-dollar tax increase , prosecutors would have to be much more discriminating . Cutting the number of death sentences in half would save $150 million each year . To put that figure in perspective , resource centers would need to prevent just 20 cases a year to cover the funding Congress cut for them in 1995 . <p> States need to institute minimum qualifications for defense lawyers . Studies show that often it 's the worst lawyers , not the worst criminals , who draw death sentences  --  a fact illustrated in in the death penalty case of George McFarland in Texas , whose lawyer repeatedly fell asleep in court ( " It 's boring , " he explained to the Houston Chronicle ) . This reform too would cut time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Assuring appropriate resources for the defense at the trial stage minimizes the risk of time-consuming and expensive post-conviction litigation " States could also place time limits on appeals ( some already do ) to force delay-minded defendants to air their claims early on , rather than withhold them for time-consuming appeals . Appeals could also be bundled and made at one time , rather than sequentially . An exception would of course be made for evidence discovered after conviction . Conservatives , no matter how justified their frustration over delays , should not perpetuate a system that refuses to hear exculpatory evidence . By amending laws like Virginia 's 21-Day Rule to allow a judge to rule on credible new evidence , lawmakers would remove a major incentive for delay . The amendment should mirror new programs like one in Illinois that allows post-conviction DNA testing . As a final safeguard , Illinois ' attorney general has proposed a board to review capital cases before execution  --  an idea endorsed by both the state bar association and conservatives like Scheidegger . <p> None of these improvements will come without political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be held accountable for the problem . This spring the Texas legislature unanimously passed a bill that would have created an agency to match indigent capital defendants with qualified lawyers . ( That Texas , which leads the nation in executions , could pass such a bill unanimously is an indication of how badly it is needed ) . Nevertheless , Governor Bush vetoed it in June . Undoubtedly , he intended to send a message to voters . But his veto killed a practical , bipartisan agreement that would have hastened justice and likely saved lives . Voters should send their own message right back . <p> The way to repair the " machinery of death " is to shift resources to points earlier in the criminal justice cycle . Only then , with the chance for error greatly diminished , would faster processing be justified . Proponents of capital punishment would have an efficient and equitable system , while opponents could argue abolition purely on its merits . With violent crime at its lowest rate in 25 years , there is no better time for sensible reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a writer living in Chicago . <p>
