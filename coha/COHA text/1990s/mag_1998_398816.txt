HERE ARE THREE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BOUND TO CAPTIvate both bulls and bears in today 's high-anxiety stock market . Who are the best stockbrokers in America ? What stocks are they telling their clients to buy and sell in the year ahead ? And , most important , why ? For answers , check out the 30 stock picks and pans offered by MONEY 's All Star lineup of 10 of the nation 's top brokers . Our 1998 team is the eighth that I 've chosen since 1988 . It sports six new members plus four repeaters from 1997-the foursome 's reward for recommending stocks that beat the S &P; 500 's incredible 36% rise over the 11-month season that began Nov. 1,1996 . Fielding four market beaters from a team of 10 is more impressive than it might seem . By comparison , only 26% of U.S. stock fund managers matched or outpaced the S &P; 500 during that period . Leading the four returning All Stars is Smith Barney 's Jeff Auxier , pictured at right , a 14-year veteran broker from Portland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an All Star , scored an average 54% gain in ' 97 . Merrill Lynch 's Charles Dare , a third-year man and 37-year vet from suburban Detroit , finished No. 2 with a 53% profit . ( Dare also placed second a year ago with a 44% gain . ) Rauscher Pierce 's Frank Sloan , a second-year All Star and 25-year pro from Dallas , came in third with a 49% return on three picks based in his hometown . No. 4 with 40% was Paine Webber 's Cynthia Bassett , another secondyear All Star and a 28-year veteran from Cleveland . // Smith Barney 's left Auxier ( see page 108 ) , who tied up the No. 1 spot in ' 97 with a 54% profit , names three picks set to rise at least 20%. // Smith Barney 's left Auxier ( see page 108 ) , who tied up the No. 1 spot in ' 97 with a 54% profit , names three picks set to rise at least 20%. // To identify our exemplars , I first asked money managers and prominent brokers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candidates had to be willing to take new accounts of $150,000 or less and to have spotless records of professional conduct according to the National Association of Securities Dealers , the best source of disciplinary actions taken against brokers . Then I focused on attributes such as accountability and independent thinking that set All Stars apart from journeymen . Our 10 All Stars customarily : Base their recommendations on their own research as well as that of analysts Personally own the stocks that are on their buy lists &gt; Avoid selling most brokerage products , whose goldplated fees can weigh down clients ' returns Give regular customers commission discounts of 20% to 25% in many cases The following profiles begin with the four returning All Stars in order of their average gain . Their six new teammates are then listed alphabetically The profiles feature each broker 's top three picks ( or pans ) and market outlook over the next 12 months . Three are bullish ; six are anxious ; one is bearish . The brokers see their 30 recommendations appreciating 41% as a group in ' 98 , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's four times the 7% profit growth forecast for companies in the S &P; 500 . Yet the picks are priced 14% below the market 's earnings multiple , recently 20 based on analysts ' consensus estimates for ' 98 . Jeff Auxier +54% in ' 97 Firm : Smith Barney in Portland , Ore. ; 800-835-9556 Age : 38 Rookie year : 1983 Client households : 150 Account minimum : $100,000 Average account : $500,000 Outlook : Bullish Resume : Native of Portland ; graduate of University of Oregon ; career broker Client profile : Local business executives and wealthy families including that of paper and textile magnate Robert Pamplin , who Forbes estimates is worth $550 million . Says Auxier : " Bob Pamplin has been a mentor and customer since my first job mowing neighborhood lawns 27 years ago at age 11 . " Comment : " My demanding clients expect me to match or beat the S &P; 500 's return without taking a lot of risk , " says Auxier . None of his three picks a year ago disappointed our readers . One of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past his 12-month target price , prompting Auxier to recommend its sale at $68 , a 46% profit , in our All Star midyear update ( see MONEY 's July issue ) . He held his two other choices , $2.2 billion ( assets ) Selective Insurance ( up 57% ) and $71 billion tobacco titan Philip Morris ( up 37% ) . What about his replacement pick at midyear ? Auxier recommended $6.6 billion property insurer TIG Holdings , which rose 24% , beating the market 's corresponding 14% gain . Picks for ' 98 : Again buy Philip Morris ( ticker symbol : MO ; recently traded on the New York Stock Exchange at $42 ; 3.8% yield ) . The New York City firm derives 65% of its profits from cigarette brands dominated by No. 1 Marlboro . A year from now , Auxier sees the stock at $51 , a 21% gain , as investors favorably anticipate a much debated congressional settlement of smoking-related lawsuits . What if a deal is struck earlier-say , in the first half of ' 98 ? " Then the stock could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " predicts Auxier . Buy $1.6 billion ( assets ) PMI Group ( PMA ; NYSE , $65 ; 0.3% ) . This San Francisco firm has a 15% share of the fast-consolidating $33 billion mortgage insurance market led by $2.5 billion MGIC ( recommended by All Star Charles Dare , below ) .

And buy $280 million Binks Sames ( BIN ; American Stock Exchange , $44 ; 0.9% ) . A year from now , says Auxier , this obscure Franklin Park , III . maker of industrial-strength paint spray guns will be wrapping up a two-year restructuring and earning about $3.50 a share . His 12-month target for the stock is $53 , a 20% profit from here .

Pacing the trio was $1 billion Genesis Health , a nursing-home chain whose stock rose 72% . Credit-card whiz First USA , with $23 billion in card receivables , promptly charged ahead 68% and was sold at midyear . But its replacement , $5 billion credit-card processor First Data , slid 5% when earnings did n't live up to analysts ' forecasts .

More and more small businesses , notes Dare , are hiring this superefficient Rochester , N.Y . data processor to streamline accounting chores such as payroll , withholding taxes and corporate tax filings . Over the past five years , earnings have grown an amazing 33% annually while net profit margins have doubled to almost 19% . He sees profits rising 31% next year and the stock hitting $50 , a 28% gain . Also buy $2.5 billion ( assets ) MGIC Investment ( MTG ; NYSE , $63 ; 0.2% ) , a leading mortgage insurer based in Milwaukee , on the strength of Dare 's forecast of 26% earnings growth this year and 19% next . His 12-month target for this low-risk stock is at least $72 , a 14% profit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merrill Lynch ( profiled above ) artfully placed second in both ' 97 , up 53% , and ' 96 , up 44%. // Firm : Rauscher Pierce Refsnes in Dallas ; 800-677-2154 Age : 53 Rookie year : 1972 Clients : 225 Minimum : $100,000 Average : $350,000 Outlook : Anxious Resume ( : Native of Odessa , Texas ; graduate of the University of Texas ; career broker Clientele : Business owners and executives who appreciate Sloan 's focus on companies based in Texas or the Southwest Comment : " I read lots of Wall Street research on firms in my area , " says Sloan . " But I wo n't buy until I 've completed my own grass-roots assessment . " That can include interviews with a company 's customers , competitors and mid-level management as well as top brass . Last year Sloan recommended three seemingly undervalued Dallas companies , led by $8.5 billion computer-chip maker Texas Instruments . The stock shot up a Texasesque 173% , amply offsetting two losing small-cap picks-$140 million driller Triton Energy ( down 2% ) and $126 million computer repairer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sloan 's three choices this year also have headquarters in his backyard . Photograph Second-year All Star Frank Sloan of Rauscher Pierce ( see right ) showcased three picks in Dallas that gained 49%. // Picks for ' 98 : Again buy Triton Energy ( OIL ; NYSE , $39 ; no dividend ) before a major oil company swallows the exploration firm to gain control of its stakes in promising wells in Colombia and the Gulf of Thailand . Unexpected production headaches plagued Triton in ' 97 , says Sloan . Next year he sees cash flow more than doubling and the stock approaching $60 , a 54% rise from here . Buy $370 million art auctioneer Sotheby 's ( BID ; NYSE , $19 ; 2.1% ) , based in New York City and controlled by Detroit real estate magnate Alfred Taubman , who owns 63% of voting shares .

And buy Dallas ' $13 billion Kimberly-Clark ( KMB ; NYSE , $51 ; 1.9% ) , maker of Huggies diapers , Kleenex tissues and other paper products . Glitches in integrating Scott Paper , acquired for $9 billion in late 1995 , slowed profit growth in ' 97 , says Sloan . Next year , however , he sees earnings jumping 19% and the stock cracking $70 , a 37% gain .

" All three delivered . Bankers Trust , with $130 billion in assets , rose 47% , while $29 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion Motorola had rebounded 42% to $64 , two bucks above her target price , and was sold . But her streak was broken by Motorola 's replacement , $400 million boating emporium West Marine . Its stock dropped 3% after the company reported earnings that were well below analysts ' estimates . Picks for ' 98 : Buy brash $7 billion telecom consolidator WorldCom ( WCOM ; Nasdaq , $30 ; no dividend ) in Jackson , Miss . for Bassett 's 12-month target price of $50 , a 67% profit . WorldCom 's proposed $37 billion stock swap to buy $19 billion long-distance rival MCI appears to have vanquished MCI suitor GTE , a $22 billion local phone carrier . The record-setting MCI bidding war , says Bassett , " is revealing the enormous hidden value of leading phone and data networks , particularly WorldCom 's . " Buy $4.8 billion Staples ( sPLs ; Nasdaq , $28 ; no dividend ) , a Westborough , Mass. chain of 650 office-supply superstores , for forecast earnings growth of 33% this year and 32% next . Bassett 's target is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Nos ; NYSE , $32 ; 2.1% ) , the nation 's 11th largest commercial bank , with $85 billion in assets and one of the nation 's largest mortgage lenders .

" They 're more comfortable earning consistent 12% to 15% annual returns than trying to beat a runaway bull market . " Besides , Frankel predicts that 1998 will mark the start of a bear market sparked by a slowdown in corporate profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6.2% , to the neighborhood of 7.5% to 8% . The bogeyman ? Frankel sees one in Asia 's mounting currency and credit crunches , which figure to force many banks and companies there to liquidate their stashes of U.S. Treasury bonds , depressing prices . Picks for ' 98 : Sell short Standard &; Poor 's Depositary Receipts , also known as SPDRs and nicknamed " spiders " ( SPY ; ASE , $92 ; 1.5% ) , which mirror moves in the S &P; 500 index . Next year Frankel sees S &P; 500 companies ' earnings rising about 6% , roughly 50% below brokerage DLJ 's estimate of 13% , and spiders falling 20% to $74 . Sell short $10 billion PC powerhouse Dell Computers ( DELL ; Nasdaq , $76 ; no dividend ) in Round Rock , Texas . Frankel 's only knock on the stock is its gold-plated price , lately 22 times estimates of ' 98 earnings . His 12-month target is $58 , a 24% drop . And buy $68 million Interneuron Pharmaceuticals ( IPIC ; Nasdaq , $12 ; no dividend ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled its Redux weight-loss drug off the market , citing safety concerns . Fears about potential liability lawsuits have dragged the stock down 64% from its ' 97 peak of almost $33 .

But Heilbronn is n't recommending either pet stock because , he says , " We 've got three other ideas , including a Japanese turnaround , that promise more upside in ' 98 . " Picks for ' 98 : Buy $4 billion Corning ( GLW ; NYSE , $43 ; 1.7% ) for the same reason cited earlier by All Star Charles Dare . Heilbronn adds that many investors fail to recognize how Corning has refocused itself as a technology company by selling its consumer-products unit ( Corning , Pyrex and Revere cookware ) and spinning off health-care businesses ( mainly testing labs ) . Heilbronn 's 12-month target , like Dare 's , is $65 , a 51% profit . Buy Japan 's $39 billion NEC Corp . ( NIPNY ; Nasdaq , $53 ; 1.3% ) , which has commanding 50% shares of that stalled economy 's computer and telecom-equipment markets .

Brown 's Baltimore headquarters gives me a competitive edge , " says Jaeger . Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous growth stocks brought public by the well-connected investment bank . So scores of wannabe Bill Gateses flock to Brown 's headquarters each month to make presentations that , quips Jaeger , " I faithfully attend to gain insights and determine , once the slide show begins , whether the top brass , you know , glows in the dark . " Picks for ' 98 : Buy $5 billion First Data ( FDC ; NYSE , $29 ; 0.3% ) , down 37% from its ' 97 peak of $46 after posting disappointing third-quarter profits .

His 12-month target is $65 , a 25% profit . Also buy $594 million ( assets ) IPC Holdings ( IPCRF ; Nasdaq , $32 ; 7% ) , an unrecognized gem among specialty insurers operating from its tax haven in Bermuda . IPC 's forte is excess property/ catastrophe coverage , providing an average of $15 million in protection that kicks in only after the first $2 billion in damages . " IPC is so profitable , " notes Jaeger , " that it 's supplementing this year 's $1.27 per-share dividend with a special $1 payout in December . " What could the stock fetch in a year ? " I 'm aiming for $39 , or 22% more , not counting the fat 7% dividend yield , " says Jaeger .

In 1992 Lieblong told me he and his clients were loading up on the $12 to $13 shares of crippled megabank Citicorp . He still owns those shares , which now trade at $123 . And Lieblong was the main source for my recommendation of Los Angeles ' Coast Savings at $16 in my May 1995 Buy Sell Hold column .

This low-profile Minnetonka , Minn. concern , initially a manager of gambling parlors on Indian reservations , owns three thriving Mississippi riverboat casinos led by GND 's 18-month-old casino/convention center at Tunica , 30 miles south of Memphis .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triton Energy ( OIL ; NYSE , $39 ; no dividend ) for the same reasons mentioned earlier by All Star Frank Sloan . Delays in ramping up oil production in Colombia have turned off impatient investors , says McLean . He sees Triton 's daily output , now 185,000 barrels , more than doubling to 500,000 barrels by midyear , turning heads on Wall Street and pushing up the stock 54% to $60 .
