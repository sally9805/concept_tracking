It is the autumn of 1998 . Hungary 's democratic government , outraged at the treatment of 1.8 million ethnic Hungarians in neighboring Romania , threatens to take back the region of Transylvania by force . Bulgaria backs Romania . Farther north , Ukraine 's government is shaken by an ultimatum from Moscow : Hand over all nuclear weapons or face a pre-emptive strike . Hungary and Ukraine turn immediately to their NATO allies for support . <P> NATO allies ? Well , not yet , but the door to the Atlantic alliance is opening , and the former Warsaw Pact nations , eager to enlist , could join before the turn of the century . Sounds like a good idea , bringing all of the Continent under one protective umbrella . But if the U.S. and its NATO allies would not fight for blood-soaked Bosnia and Herzegovina , will they do so for Hungary ? How about Poland in a clash with Russia ? Do the Atlantic democracies have the will and the resources to spread their security guarantees over Central and Eastern Europe , taking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have poisoned the region for centuries ? And if they do , are they also prepared for the hostile reaction the move will trigger in a Russia that looks westward with as much suspicion as envy ? Is there any virtue in a new NATO that shifts the Iron Curtain back to Russia 's very borders ? <P> These are not academic questions . Bill Clinton has called a NATO summit to convene in Brussels next Jan. 10 , to plan the organization 's march eastward . The meeting , Secretary of State Warren Christopher told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week , will " formally open the door to an evolutionary process of NATO expansion . " He had just returned from an eight- day trip to the old Warsaw Pact countries to " renew " NATO and polish a plan to enlist those former Soviet satellites that are making visible progress toward democracy . " The alliance must embrace innovation or risk irrelevance , " he reported to Congress . He even discussed the proposed expansion with Boris Yeltsin and found the Russian President " very positive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been happy with such a prospect up to now . Anything positive Yeltsin might have said to Christopher was more likely in response to a go-slow signal coming from NATO defense ministers when they met last month in Travemunde , Germany . Under the ambiguous slogan " Partnership for Peace , " the military chiefs made it clear that East European states would not be joining the alliance any time soon . They would be offered military cooperation agreements , but not full membership in NATO  --  which today includes 16 states  --  until some vague point in the future . It is only membership that brings the gilt-edged security guarantee : an attack on one is to be considered an attack on all . <P> Not long ago , when the Berlin Wall , the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union were all collapsing , many experts thought NATO had served its purpose and its demise would soon follow . Now the East Europeans are clamoring for protection from  --  depending on their location  --  Russia , Germany , Ukraine or one another . The preferred solution of each is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West 's desire to find a post-cold war role for the alliance and a new world order that works .
