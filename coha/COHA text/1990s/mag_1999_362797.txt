When Charlene Smith found the intruder in her house in Johannesburg , South Africa , she started screaming . But he had a knife , and very soon her hands were tied behind her back with rounds of thick masking tape . Then he raped her . But her ordeal was not over after he left . In a country with one of the highest rates of HIV infection in the world , bureaucratic and hospital red tape kept her from getting preventive drugs for 5 1/2 hours . If she had not complained loudly and bitterly , she might never have got the medication . The experience left her stunned and confused : " My left hand is caked in blood . I am wearing a gown and have masking tape in my hair , around my wrists , neck , ankles and knees ... I realize I 'm standing with my arms at my sides facing the wall , saying quietly over and over , ' I 'm alive . I 'm alive . ' " In the account of her ordeal published in April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for AIDS medication , an additional 7,200 women and children were raped in South Africa . <P> Smith , a free-lance journalist and author , is the most eloquent voice in a country in the throes of an epidemic . South Africa recorded 1,263 rapes in 1979 . Today the official annual figure is nearly 50,000 , but rape-crisis researchers say only 1 in 35 is reported . That means there are more than 1.6 million rapes a year  --  the highest incidence in the world , according to Interpol . ( In 1998 the official South African rate was 104.1 rapes per 100,000 people ; in the U.S. the rate was 34.4 per 100,000 . ) Worse , the cultural and legal attitudes toward rape are practically medieval . In Johannesburg , where the HIV-infection rate is reckoned to be 40% among men in the " rapist " age bracket ( 20 to 29 ) , many believe raping a virgin will cure HIV . Earlier this month a prominent judge sentenced a 54-year-old man who had raped his 14-year-old daughter to just seven years in prison . Because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained , little harm was done to the wider community . Furthermore , he said , by the time her father is released in seven years , the girl will have moved out . <P> The decision incensed anti-rape activists and further energized a movement already fueled by outrage . " Nowhere since the final days of apartheid has there been greater activism in a national social issue , " says Smith , 42 , who was an antiapartheid journalist of some repute . " Rape victims are speaking out because we are people , not statistics . We have nothing to be ashamed of . South Africa is a so-called moral society that does nothing , that should be filled with shame . " Indeed , in a country in which race remains hugely sensitive , the debate centers , surprisingly , not on race but on gender equality . An antirape TV ad by actress Charlize Theron , for example , was temporarily pulled because it offended men ( see box ) .                 @ @ @ @
