<p> Two men hold keys to the future of the economy of South Korea  --  one a union boss who a year ago backed a nationwide strike over job protection laws , the other a maverick governor who has espoused the virtues of free markets and foreign investment . <p> Both campaigned for President-elect Kim Dae Jung , and , faced with the near bankruptcy of the South Korean economy , both are pledging allegiance to Kim and to an International Monetary Fund program designed to get their country off the ropes . <p> But Gov . You Jong Kuen , a former Rutgers University economics professor who has emerged as one of Kim 's top economic advisers , and Park In Sang , leader of the 1.2 million-member Federation of Korean Trade Unions , make an odd couple among the supporters of the president-elect . <p> For now , the two men do not seem far apart . Both express concern about finding ways to limit layoffs but agree they can not be avoided . Both talk about reorganizing companies and ending the corrupt relationship between many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea must adapt to a tightly intertwined world . <p> " People blame the IMF and talk about the East Asian model , " said You . " But it 's precisely the East Asian model of using connections and high debt that 's created this situation . " <p> " Globalization is unavoidable , " said Park . " We have to accept it naturally . " <p> But while the economic emergency has united South Koreans behind an economic rescue program for now , the hardships in store for the country could well split that consensus in the months ahead . And within Kim 's coalition , these two men could later find themselves standing on opposite sides of the fault line . <p> You , 53 , is one of the key players at the moment . He spent 24 years in the United States , first as a student , then as a Rutgers professor and finally as a member of the economic policy council of the state of New Jersey for governors Brendan Byrne and Thomas Kean . " I began thinking about doing the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active in the South Korean democratic movement and befriended Kim Dae Jung when Kim was in exile in the United States in the 1980s . <p> In 1994 , You returned to Korea and defeated the chairman of Kim 's party for the nomination for the governorship of North Cholla Province . Kim initially discouraged him but in the end remained neutral in the race . In the general election , You defeated a candidate who was a foe of foreign investment . <p> " Many have thought that foreign direct investment meant a loss of control and economic sovereignty , " said You , who noted that the sharp increase in direct foreign investment recently to an annual level of $ 3 billion was still tiny for an economy the size of South Korea 's . He added that many politicians liked the old South Korean system , which allowed the government to decide where investment could go ; that gave it the power to dispense favors , and thus opened the doors to corruption . <p> As a governor , You has attracted more than a dozen modest-size foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . He has tried to promote several others , including the possible sale of a resort to entertainer Michael Jackson , who visited South Korea to have a look . You later persuaded Jackson to join international financier George Soros and former secretary of commerce Mickey Kantor in a teleconference hosted by Kim during the presidential campaign to discuss how to rescue the South Korean economy . Recently , You has been ardently courting Dow Chemical , which is trying to decide where to locate a $ 2.8 billion plant . <p> " Korea has been very unwise in the past by not being very friendly to foreign direct investment , " said You , whose message to foreign investors has become party dogma now that it is clear the country desperately needs investments to provide new capital for heavily indebted South Korean firms . <p> Today , the South Korean government and Kim 's party approved a package of measures recommended by the IMF that are sure to please You . South Korea will remove existing limits on foreign capital flows and foreign investments in South Korean banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revise the country 's labor laws to make layoffs easier . <p> Union leader Park , unlike You , has undergone a recent conversion to the IMF program and a more open economy . Last January , he was demanding 11 percent wage increases for workers . Just two weeks ago , he was demanding job security ; a ban on hostile takeovers ; job guarantees for employees of merged companies ; union consultation before layoffs ; and " renegotiation with IMF . . . in order to minimize unnecessary social tension " and prevent steps that " threaten the employment and decent lives of workers . " <p> But much has changed in two weeks . The country is staring bankruptcy in the face , and companies are beginning to shut down because they can not get parts or day-to-day financing . <p> " I basically support the IMF conditions , " said Park , as he smoked a cigarette this week in his office . " Workers and trade unions are strongly supporting economic reforms . " <p> For Park and the union movement , South Korea 's economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea 's military rule 10 years ago , the labor movement has been a powerful force in the country , and many analysts say its demands have discouraged foreign investors . From 1987 through 1995 , South Korean wages rose by an average of 15 percent a year , far outstripping inflation and gains in productivity . Strikes were common , but Park says that wages had to catch up . <p> At the same time , however , union representation among South Korean workers has dwindled from 19 percent to 14 percent . Earlier this year , when union leaders tried to call a nationwide general strike to protest a change in labor laws , the response was weak . <p> The election of Kim Dae Jung , the first opposition candidate to win the presidency in South Korea , represented an important political victory for a longtime friend of the union movement . But even at that moment of triumph , the financial crisis was undermining labor 's gains . <p> Analysts predict that 1 million of South Korea 's 13 million employees will be thrown out of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete job security and a wage increase of 11 percent for South Korean workers , now he is pleading that wages be frozen as a less painful alternative to mass layoffs . In fact , both pay cuts and layoffs are more likely ; companies are proposing deep wage cuts as they try to rescue themselves from cash crunches and suffocating debt loads . <p> " Venture capital companies should be increased and opened and create new jobs , " said Park . " We will accept a reduction in working hours and partly accept a reduction of wages to minimize the layoffs . " <p> Park said that the Federation of Korean Trade Unions favors a " step by step " reduction in the length of the workweek , from 46 to 42 hours , as a way of maintaining jobs . He also expects unemployment to rise , though he believes it can be limited to an additional 1 percent of the work force , a prediction that most economic analysts believe is too optimistic . <p> Across town in a hotel room , You worried that unions will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , said You , " has to be prepared to face " strikes . " If you want to maintain the leadership of a union , you have to maintain militancy , " he said . <p> One condition of the IMF package is to give South Korean firms , now bound by a restrictive labor law , greater flexibility to lay off workers . President-elect Kim and outgoing President Kim Young Sam have indicated that revisions would be made next month , one year after the trade unions tried to mobilize against more modest changes in the law . <p> It will be up to Kim Dae Jung to work out conflicts within this alliance , and he appears ready to defy the expectations of people who in the past portrayed him as a leftist or a captive of organized labor . " Kim has become a trusted follower of the completely free market system , " said Kim Won Gil , another economic adviser to the president-elect . You said Kim has a better chance than anyone of persuading the unions to go along with the reform package @
