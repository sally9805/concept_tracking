A Universal Studios Theme Park In Japan Sits on Top of a Toxic Waste Site // There were the usual men in suits , and there were also actors dressed as Woody Woodpecker , Marilyn Monroe , Herman Munster and Groucho Marx . The place was Osaka , Japan , two years ago , and the occasion was the signing of an agreement between Universal Studios Inc. , a huge entertainment conglomerate ( formerly MCA ) , and the Osaka city government to build a whiz-bang Universal Studios theme park on an old 140-acre industrial site in the city . The park , to be completed by 2001 , is a no-brainer : The Japanese clearly love theme parks . Tokyo Disneyland is a huge hit , attracting 17 million visitors in 1996 alone . And Disney is planning a $2.6 billion extension of its park , to be called DisneySea , on a Tokyo Bay landfill . The competing Universal Studios park will feature attractions based on such Universal movies as E. T and Jurassic Park , both number one box office hits in Japan . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a creative consultant . In Japan , the line between public and private enterprise is not finely drawn . Osaka 's city government , through its joint venture , is the single largest investor in the project , with an approximately 25 percent share of the $1.6 billion project . The other major Japanese investor is Sumitomo Corporation , whose Sumitomo Metal Industries owned a 17acre corner of the industrial site . But Sumitomo Metals is n't The Nature Conservancy , and it was n't a benign steward of the land when it was in possession . Instead , it buried 700,000 tons of contaminated mud , laced with PCBs , heavy metals and other carcinogens on the site over a 25-year-period ending in 1989 . Nao Watano , the former director of a waste disposal company subcontracted by Sumitomo , told The Japan Times , " We dumped the solid metal waste out in the open , piled it up and then just covered it with dirt as ordered by Sumitomo . We did not encase it or anything to protect it from the elements . " In 1986 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been used for dumping toxic waste and ordered a perfunctory cleanup , but according to the weekly magazine Kansai Jitsuwa , the city was not aware of the full extent of the problem and no major remediation occurred . The latest round of environmental testing , last summer , was conducted by ... Sumitomo itself , working with its partner in the project , Osaka 's city government . It revealed overwhelming environmental damage . Chlorine contamination was 12 times higher than the Japanese standard , lead 1.7 times , arsenic 3.5 times , mercury 1.2 times and selenium 15 times higher . High concentrations of chromium , a metal believed to cause lung cancer , were also found . In a letter last September to the California-based Universal Studios Recreation Group , Yoneko Matsura of Osaka 's Mihariban Citizens ' Watchdog Group accused Sumitomo of deceiving the city and the public about the contamination . " We have lost faith in the Universal Studios project and no longer trust either the city or Universal Studios Japan to build an environmentally safe theme park , " Matsura wrote . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a 2001 opening date , according to Jim Yeager , director of public relations for the Universal Studios Recreation Group . After first claiming that Mihariban is " a tiny group affiliated with the Japanese Communist Party , " Yeager outlined the current cleanup plans , which he said will take about 18 months . " We knew going in that almost any&gt;here we decided to build would have environmental challenges , " he says . " The city has undertaken exhaustive analysis of the site with a blue-ribbon committee of leading environmental academics at the top universities in the area , and that committee has made recommendations for a thorough cleanup of the site . We will rigorously implement whatever is necessary to prepare for a world-class theme park . " Osaka is a heavily industrialized city , and like most of Japan , operated until recently with very limited environmental regulations . Much of Sumitomo 's dumping was probably legal when it occurred ( though covering it up would presumably not be ) . Given Japanese overcrowding and pervasive industrial pollution , it 's unlikely that an alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumitomo 's mess , Yeager says , " appears to be doable . " Photograph The Universal stars turned out in Osaka for the announcement of a $il.6 billion movie theme park // In a statement , Universal Studios claims that the proposed cleanup , which will involve " removal and engineered entombment of both contaminated and even semi-contaminated soil " is " unprecedented for Japan . " The soil will be removed , but it wo n't be taken off the site : The current plan is to bury it under the parking lot , in a plastic-lined concrete box . " What is being done is consistent with the way this would be handled for any of our Universal parks anywhere in the world , including the U.S. , " says the statement . Stephen Lester begs to differ . As science director for the Virginia-based Center for Health , Environment and Justice , he says that the proposed cleanup , which raises the possibility of heavy metals leaching into the soil and groundwater under the parking lot , would not likely pass muster in the U.S. , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on how the entombment is done , but you would n't find that sort of cleanup here , " he says . " There 's too much risk of future exposure , particularly in a public place like a theme park . " Consultant Steven Spielberg has not yet been to Osaka to see the site , according to Marvin Levy , a spokesman for his film companies Amblin and DreamWorks SKG . But Spielberg has environmental problems even without the Osaka theme park , since DreamWorks is fighting a bitter battle over plans to build Playa Vista , a corporate headquarters complex that would obliterate part of the Ballona Wetlands outside Los Angeles . " Nobody has said " no " to Steven Spielberg in a long time , " says Marcia Hanscom , executive director of DreamWorks opponent Wetlands Action Network . " It 's a typical Hollywood thing in which you think that the virtual reality they create is just as good or better than the nature they destroy . " Levy counters that " no one person has done as much for environmental causes as Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anyone dreamed of before . " Osaka officials are reportedly still worried that the project will collapse . " Universal Studios is very concerned about their image , especially as this is their first overseas venture , " said one official to The Japan Times . <p>
