ContentsIn the future , everyone will be someone else . # In the future , everyone will be someone else . At her school , the future had been discussed as if it were a definite sort of business , with tangible boundaries like an island nation . It was a place you could rocket to or grope towards in a state of anticipation . But if thinking about your actual future seemed like an exercise in futility , you could , in a wish-upon-astar kind of way , imagine an idealistic prospect in which the logic of gravity was suspended and anything was possible . Hands shot up against a map of Europe and waved with the anxiety of uncontainable ideas spilling over into a damp afternoon . Audrey had nothing to say . Bored with the easy-out of imagining miraculous surgeries , faster cars , Big Brother governments , she watched the clock , sometimes listening to the discussion , sometimes not . When the bell rang , she slammed out with everyone else , part of a wave headed towards buses and subways . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , newspapers weighted down with leaden Yankees and Mets symbols , past a Mexican restaurant whose sign was a giant sequined sombrero , it all seemed permanent yet futureless . The sombrero might blow away and land on the head of the Statue of Liberty , the newspaper stand might be taken over by someone who knew of Yankees only as a kind of soldier . She stopped to look at magazines and videos in a shop near her apartment building . The shop was empty ; the Russian clerk looked bored and drummed his fingers as if playing a piano , then , when he grew aware of Audrey 's watching , he stopped only to nervously twirl the dial of a radio propped between a display of razor blades and boxes of water filters . His family ran the shop , and they spoke Russian to one another , arguing and shouting behind the counter . Today only the middle-aged son was in the shop , agitated and cracking his gum . He finally settled on a salsa station , and Audrey moved on . In another part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting cards , rows of aspirin bottles that were of no interest , so on she strolled to flip through magazines . These , at least , were entertaining . In pictures of women wearing expensive clothing in remote settings , the models looked terminally adult and inaccessible , able to have conversations with men who appeared in the margins or background of the photographs . They stretched their provocative legs over car seats , lay on beaches holding glasses of white wine the color of sand , pretended to run down rain-drenched streets in billowing black coats . Audrey turned the pages slowly . The clerk came around from behind the counter and told her to buy one or stop damaging his merchandise . In response she circled the aisles as if she had some purpose for being there , as if she were looking for something in particular , although all she was really doing was wasting time . He kept staring at her . Audrey wanted to say to him : You 're afraid I 'm going to steal cough syrup used to produce a nauseating high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Mars bar , anything . She edged close to the back room . There in the back , one found videos mixed in with the magazines . She 'd poked around in such remote shelves before . What she found was a source of curiosity and undefined mystery , if not danger . Audrey stopped in front of a row of video boxes featuring nearly naked men on their covers and picked one up . A photograph of a man holding the end of a towel between his legs looked the image of good health . Just as she was about to put it back , the clerk pushed his way past crates of unopened stock that lined the narrow aisles and approached her with the face of a demon , insulted and provoked by a mosquito he was determined to annihilate . Orange foil wrapping from discounted Halloween candy clung to his cuff . He grabbed the box from her as if she were two years old . <p> " No minors alone here , " he said . " Curiosity kills the mouse . " <p> Audrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen to the floor and wished she could pretend to be an alien , unable to speak English . In a foreign vernacular whose vulgarities would make her sound sophisticated or at least really smart , she would tell him to leave her alone , but instead of uttering fake silent Italian , she turned her back on the magazine racks of half-naked men and women and muttered a few nonsense syllables that she imagined sounded like expletives in some kind of language . <p> " What ? " the clerk asked , angry at her , at all children . " What did you say to me ? " <p> She looked at him in mute horror , slouched up to the cashier at the front , paid for a juvenile magazine she did n't want , and , feeling acutely self-conscious , left the store . <p> She walked past a building that was partly bricked up . Squatters occupied a few of the floors . A girl in a devil costume looked out of a second-story window . A younger child  --  still , Audrey had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore red tights , a black cape , and had rubber horns attached to her head . She waved a pitchfork at Audrey , prongs covered in tin foil , then she disappeared into the building . <p> It had n't been a friendly wave , and although Audrey did n't feel threatened by some junior loony tune acting tough , the little devil materialized in such a way so as to appear part and parcel of her crappy afternoon . Scripted to be stifling , a finger wagging oppressively as if someone were telling her that just when she thought she was judging her surroundings with a cool above-it-all eye , she could n't even look at a magazine or a row of videos without being thrown out , accused of being a girl who transgressed , who looked where she was bound to suffer , to be bitten badly , to have her pretensions unmasked . Audrey rounded the corner of her street , inhaled the sugary smell of the twenty-four-hour Mexican bakery whose doughnuts and twists of fried dough offered some kind of comfort . She tossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a chartreuse halter winked on its cover . No similar image of coyness and perkiness could be found on her street . The images from the videos danced in a crazy quilt or  --  what ? terror ? shock. * What do women and men or men and men do ? Buy me , they seemed to taunt . Try me ! What 's the big deal ? Are you a little devil , too ? Kind of a half-assed one . You 're so at sea ! <p> When she arrived at her building , the old woman who always sat by the stoop on a folding chair or a milk crate was waiting for her . Audrey 's mother called the woman " the concierge " because she sat there day after day , watching whatever was going on in the street , secretly monitoring the kinds of people who visited Mr. Davis on the third floor or complaining about the way certain tenants slammed the front door when they came home early in the morning . Her stockings were rolled down , and she drank beer out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman made Audrey uneasy , and she tried to avoid her . She had once heard her complain about the late hour her mother left for work , and this from a woman who sat on her duff all day annoyed Audrey no end . Parked on the front steps , there was no way to avoid her , and her mother always told her to he nice to the old woman no matter what . She does n't know what she 's saying . No , you 're wrong , she knows exactly what she 's saying . The woman was reading a newsprint magazine , the headlines read , " Royal Monster , Close Relative of Queen Victoria Discovered at Last . " On the cover was a picture of a wrinkled and deformed creature , a kind of E.T . in a suit , apparently a long-lost member of the Royal family . <p> " What are you reading about ? " <p> " Prince X. " <p> " Does n't he have a name ? " <p> " No , dummy , he was kept hidden away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't he ? " <p> " If he was found today , they could have fixed him with plastic surgery . " <p> Audrey looked at the picture of the monster with interest ; it gave her an opportunity to appear curious , and so keep the nosy concierge at a friendly distance . <p> " How did they know he was a man ? " <p> " How do you think ? Get lost ! " <p> The grotesque prince reminded her of part of the class discussion . He could have had his brain put in another 's body . The volunteer might then have been in line to the throne . Her neighbor found this an entertaining suggestion . <p> " Would they accept a woman 's brain to go into a man ? You could keep changing bodies , you could live forever . " She took a drink from the beery paper cup as if it contained coffee . <p> Audrey jingled her keys and went upstairs , hoping the concierge had n't pissed in the hall because she could n't make it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ever saw the old woman do this , it was assumed she was the only tenant capable of such audacity and weakness . As Audrey reached the first landing , unzipping her jacket , she hummed a song which had stuck in her head since lunch recess . She walked slowly . Her shoes felt as if they had lead in them . There was a dented triangular mirror placed over a corner near the ceiling so one could see whether anyone lurked down the hall . She thought she saw half a trouser leg and a foot disappear around a corner . <p> Her mother was already home . <p> " Brain transplants , " Audrey said to her mother as she took off her shoes , " will be as easy as tonsillectomies , and all ethical questions will be suspended . The procedure will be done as a fairly routine outpatient operation . You think you recognize someone on the street , but you ca n't be sure . He 's not the man you thought he was . " <p> By a week after Halloween , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white furry Christmas bells . Ronnie hated them . She wanted to swing from bell to bell like Tarzan . She hoped they would float away on a strong wind and land somewhere out in the middle of the Atlantic to be washed ashore on a Senegalese beach . The wire and tinsel would be taken apart and woven into baskets , balanced on heads or incorporated into ceremonial objects that would glint more usefully in villages than they did in her city , where as fake bells they only served to remind people of shopping , or if you did n't have to buy anything , the decorations signified the rapid passing of time , one holiday slamming into the next . She stopped to buy a newspaper at a store which also sold greeting cards , toys , and party decorations . A woman with an ambulance-driver insignia on her sleeve stood ahead of her in line and bought cigarettes and a toy Road Runner . The plastic bird had legs which swiveled just as those of the cartoon character did , and blue-gray plastic dust was somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the bird was intended for the ambulance dashboard and who the cigarettes were for . When would the driver herself have time to smoke ? She had once seen an old movie in which Robert Benchley played a doctor who sat at his office desk , smoked cigarette after cigarette , and offered all kinds of health advice . The audience had laughed hysterically , not so much at the advice intended to be absurd , but at the image of a doctor chain-smoking . The idea of an ambulance careening around the city with a driver puffing away had the same comic cast to it . <p> Ronnie peeled some of the other characters off their Velcro backings : Batman , Daffy Duck , a pirate whose name she did n't know , then put them back . Audrey was too old for these small figures . There was nothing in the store Audrey would want , but Ronnie looked among the pens and calendars , read a few greeting cards and joke books , as if her daughter were a tyrant who demanded gifts . She knew this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still wearing beepets and stethoscope , made her feel guilty , although she did n't know why . She finally left the store with her newspaper and a pocket-size Mickey Mouse . <p> The job was described to Ronnie when she answered an ad in the paper : she would have to call the people quoted in articles and verify what they had said by repeating attributed lines over the telephone . It required someone meticulous , someone who could throw him- or herself into the problem of tracking down speakers and verifying statements which were often controversial . It was n't a magazine she read on a regular basis unless she was in a waiting room , but no one in the personnel office asked her what she read . The job required a clear speaking voice and persistence . Ronnie doubted she had either of these skills , but she was hired and sent on to another set of offices . The woman who was in charge of Ronnie 's future department introduced herself as Mrs. Binder and looked over her forms sent from personnel . <p> " Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud . " You do n't speak with an accent . " <p> " We left when I was three . " <p> They shared a small office . The room had silver windows , facing the corridor on one side and a view of the street , trucks pulling up to loading bays , on the other . Mrs. Binder  --  Felice  --  showed Ronnie how to scan copy for quotes , how to make overseas telephone calls using various charge codes . Felice looked out at the men pushing racks of dresses down the street . " Rough characters , " she said to Ronnie . " Watch your bag when you go to lunch . " Ronnie noted her archaic turn of phrase as a sign Felice was a stickler , something of a fuddy-duddy , warnings that she might be difficult to work for . A rough character , not , Audrey would have said . <p> She had written Berlin . She would n't stay at the job long . If asked , she would have said that when she was still a baby , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somehow a few years later , when her grandmother died , she was sent to a family in New York . The director of personnel had only looked at her application in a cursory way before sending her upstairs . For years she had filled in forms with place of birth , Brooklyn , then in the personnel office , she slowly drew a B , then turned the r into an e , and the rest followed , r-l-i-n , like a nonsense word which could scarcely evoke grainy goose-stepping newsreels or images of a split city . She tried it out for a while , Berlin . She dropped the e from her last name , saying her old name had been threatening , as if all it needed was the n-s-t-e-i-n . <p> There was a picture of Ronnie 's mother holding her as an infant : . The picture had been taken in Prospect Park , but from a distance . The baby could have been any baby . Birth records had been lost when they moved to California . The certificate had been in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped like a submarine which was filled with foreign stamps , an ashtray from a motel in Los Angeles . <p> " The movers trekked up and down stairs for hours carrying boxes , so a few things were lost or accidentally left behind , " Ronnie said . <p> Audrey turned the photograph over . Nothing had been written on the back . She thought the job checking quotes sounded like a rehearsal for a courtroom drama . <p> " Is that what you really said ? Are you sure ? Do you stand by the accuracy of your statements ? " Audrey said into an imaginary telephone . Then she marched around the apartment singing Mrs. Binder 's name to " Alouette . " Mrs. Binder . Mrs. Mrs. Binder . Mrs. Binder , je te plumerai ! <p> " It might be Mrs. Fast Binder , " Ronnie said , " because she does n't waste any time . You never know . " <p> " It 's Felice " said Audrey . " I looked at one of your forms . Who did you actually call today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had claimed to be Anastasia . She had been interviewed in Berlin many years ago . Actually , I had to speak to her grandson , who lives in Boston . Then I spoke to a man in Virginia who maintained he was the Lindbergh baby " <p> Audrey followed Ronnie into the kitchen and put her feet on the table . Ronnie gave her a small knife with melted chocolate sticking to it . Audrey licked the knife then held it as if it were a cigar , tapping imaginary ash to the floor . She had never heard of the Lindbergh baby and had only a vague idea of who Anastasia might be . <p> " He was the first man to fly across the Atlantic , but his baby was kidnapped and murdered . According to a man in Virginia , the child was n't murdered . He claims to be the real Lindbergh , Jr . He offered to send his dental x-rays as proof . " <p> " Did he send them ? " <p> " Not to me . " <p> " All these stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure . " <p> The television program droning in the background seemed to echo this theme . It was about a man who claimed to be the richest man in the world . He asserted that his money had been left to him by the last ruler of Ghana , and the billions were locked in something called the Ghana-Oman trust , sealed , inaccessible in a Swiss bank . He persuaded investors to give him money in order to conduct the legal process necessary to unlock the trust . <p> " Unlock the trust , " Ronnie repeated . It sounded mythological , not the language of legal suits . " There will probably be something written about this faker before the end of the week . " The imposter promised them a return of ten times their initial investment . People turned up at his offices in droves . They could n't write him checks fast enough . He was known as " The Fat Man , " and he was filmed wearing African ceremonial robes in a townhouse in London . A businessman from Pennsylvania gave him seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the man from Pennsylvania never saw a dime , but he told the camera he was still hoping . He said he would hesitate to use the word swindle . <p> Audrey turned herself upside down on her chair so her legs were against the back and her head hung over the seat . She laughed at the floor . Ronnie found the program disturbing and turned off the television . Her daughter imitated the Fat Man . In a BBC accent , she asked her mother for twenty dollars , saying she was meeting friends and would certainly come back later with ten times that amount . Ronnie gave her the money , and Audrey disappeared . <p> Ronnie looked out a window and watched the old woman still sitting on the step babbling to Audrey , caught in her torrent of speech . I do n't know nothing . f anyone asks you , you do n't know nothing . Ronnie had seen condoms stuck under the woman 's folding chair , sticky bits and pieces someone had used in the middle of the night . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing , the concierge knew a lot about what went on in the street hour after hour , day after day , yet ignored what lay underfoot . What else could she do ? Did Audrey hear the sounds from the street that kept Ronnie awake at night ? Sometimes Ronnie looked in on her , opening the door only a crack , but she appeared to sleep through all of it . <p> A story about con artists , from the petty small-time cheats who circulate in train stations claiming to have lost their fare , to bigtime crackpots , greeted Ronnie Friday morning . Crackpot was Felice 's word . The writer of the story did n't make any judgments . These were n't really celebrity cons , and perhaps not cons at all . All denied invidious intent , they were only concerned with simple problems of identity . Ronnie felt overwhelmed by a deluge of facts , quotes , telephone numbers , and identities , broken-off chips of sentences , isolated tags of statements , often arriving at her desk without much of a context . Listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the effect that nothing , all the references and allusions , was destined to stay in her conscience for long , but it was dizzying . She felt as if she had been assigned to work on some kind of conveyor belt on which fragments of stories and situations from popular culture to political intrigue zipped past her as she tried to assign meaning to each piece before they sped past her grasp . <p> As Felice moved papers from one side of her desk to other , Ronnie was reminded of an exhibit she had seen years ago in which a professor at an upstate New York college , an archaeologist , invented an ancient civilization and created all kinds of artifacts he claimed were made by these people . It was n't a hoax , the objects and the invented people were openly just that , a fabrication on his part . If you looked closely at a series of votives , you would find they were made from parts of old blenders . Innards of toasters and irons had been fashioned into ritual ornaments . Pencil sharpeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the objects was n't easy to spot . The people whose fragments of stories simultaneously disguised and unmasked themselves were like those objects she had spent a long time staring at until the game was figured out . <p> " They might be telling the truth , " Ronnie said as she folded her newspaper . <p> Felice nodded , running her hand through newly garnet-colored hair . Ronnie began with the case of a woman who claimed to be a fraternal twin of Patty Hearst , her identity obfuscated by a deliberate mix up at the hospital . She now lived in San Diego and , as a Hearst twin , felt she was entitled to part of their fortune . Same birthday , same hospital , a baby had been stillborn , a switch had been made with one of the twins . When a picture of Cathy Bell was placed next to a picture of Patty Hearst , they did look remarkably similar . Cathy Bell claimed her adoptive mother had been a nurse , and when her own baby died of sudden crib death , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch . Both women were deceased , so Cathy 's story ran into difficulty when it came to verification on her behalf . The Hearst family said Cathy was a lunatic . Her story was preposterous . Mrs. Hearst never had twins , and if she had , where was the bogus birth certificate of the snitched twin ? Cathy had no answers but volunteered for a DNA test . <p> " They think I 'm another kind of SLA , another Colonel Cinque or Squeaky Fromm trying to extort money , " Cathy said , " and they 're right to be suspicious , but really I 'm not connected to any organization . I 'm glad they 're being careful with my money , at least . " <p> Ronnie only needed to verify the quote but told her she did look remarkably like Patty Hearst . <p> " Of course I do , " Cathy Bell said . " I 'm her sister . " <p> Cathy asked her how the air looked in New York ; smog hung densely over Los Angeles . She had always wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east than Tucson . She was bored at her job working in a small real estate office , and she was glad it was Friday . Ronnie felt complicitous with Cathy Bell , regardless of whether her claim was true or an invention . The sense of complicity was entirely false , and she knew it , but when she hung up , Ronnie felt alone in the room . She stared out the window in an unfocused way at the tiny heads and shoulders below . Felice was reading and looked up to ask Ronnie if she 'd gotten her picture taken yet for her company ID . <p> Calls to secretaries in the State Department to verify quotes , and queries overseas , made Ronnie feel anonymous and important at the same time . She learned the various codes by heart , and rang foreign cities and statesmen 's offices as if she were dialing the weather number . Translated quotes presented special problems . <p> " Sentences marked in green or red ink demand immediate attention , " Felice explained . These were gateways to confusion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracked down . <p> Ronnie skipped a story about a mathematical genius from MIT ; instead she went on to a story about illegal aliens by a writer who worked in the building . She would be easy to call , four numbers , an extension which probably rang downstairs . As she waited she drew a little man standing in phone booth . Finally the writer picked up the line . Ronnie had been drawing slanting rain on the edge of a message pad and jumped when she heard a voice at the other end of the telephone . <p> " I 'd like to repeat this quote , " Ronnie said , but the woman on the other end of the line became angry , offended by an imagined suggestion of inaccuracy or fraud . <p> " Who do you think you are ? " the writer asked . <p> " What do you mean , who am I ? I 'm a fact checker . " Aware of Felice staring at her , Ronnie tried to sound more contentious but soon backed down . <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation with you . I 'm not questioning your story . " <p> Felice walked over to her desk and took the telephone from her hand . <p> " We 're not saying you invented these people for the sake of a story . " There was a pause while the other woman answered , probably defensively , and Felice looked upwards . " No , we do n't think you made a mistake translating their words , we 're only checking in the event that a slip-up might have occurred in the transcription . " <p> Putting her hand over the receiver , Felice said , " She must be new . We do this all the time , and writers know it 's standard procedure . " <p> Ronnie reached for the telephone , but Felice waved her away , checked the quote , then hung up . <p> " That 's just the way things are done , " she explained . <p> " It could have been made up and true at the same time , " Ronnie suggested with complete innocence . " There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean it . The story , like many other stories , could easily have been made up and true at the same time . " She tossed out half a cup of cold coffee , watching the sodden paper in the basket . <p> The story in question , written in short telegraphic sentences , was about illegal immigrants working invisibly throughout the city , and spoke of hidden injuries that remained or were incurred as a result of the aliens ' seeming transparency in the city . They lived in fear and believed they had no legal redress from exploitative employers : sweatshop owners , pimps , thugs who kept them in near imprisonment or forced them to commit crimes , living under threats not just to themselves but to families back home . Ronnie looked out the window . Heads and shoulders congregated around one of the loading bays far below across the street , as if there might have been an accident . She imagined the stowaways and illegals the writer had interviewed , people terrified of doctors , afraid to give anyone their names . Inconspicuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vital , the article had said , yet unknown and tax-free . <p> " I ca n't verify their words . I do n't even have their real names , " the woman had said , as if Ronnie were some kind of naive dolt . " You read what I wrote . You must realize I ca n't put these people in greater danger than they 're already in . " She was angry , and Ronnie felt she had a right to be . It was the kind of anger that slid off Felice 's back , but Ronnie took it home with her and lived with sharp particles of humiliation for days . <p> She looked forward to stories about dead people ; there were fewer telephone calls to make when the main protagonists could n't be reached . Felice warned her about what she called " smoking guns " and " stalking horses " in a piece of writing . It was four-thirty , She could make one more call , and so following Felice 's advice , she scanned a story which appeared more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nineteenthcentury paintings . Ronnie called the auction house to verify a quote . It was simple . <p> " Could these be the correct prices ? " <p> " We 're seeing a lot of foreign interest , yes , that 's what I said . " Felice , who had been listening again as she cleaned the top of her desk , pointed out the obvious irony in that the original artists may have died in the poorhouse , reaping no benefit from the inflated sums their paintings now commanded . It was Friday afternoon , and she threw pens and notepads into a drawer with gusto , a sign she was leaving early . <p> " All paths lead to Rome . See you Monday , " she said , waving at Ronnie as she left , the office 's glass doors swinging behind her . Ronnie waited twenty minutes after Felice could be seen getting into the elevator . She might become snarled in conversation with someone met on the way out or she might dawdle at the lobby kiosk , so Ronnie allowed time to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the day . She did n't want to talk to Felice for the few blocks they might walk in common together . She looked at the blue veins on the backs of her hands , smoothed the sleeves of an overly large black jacket , and watched . Unlike the cons , Ronnie usually felt at home in her body , although she recognized this feeling was in itself a kind of con she often put over on herself . <p> When Audrey moaned about having to write a paper about what she thought the future might look like , Ronnie suggested they go to Queens to see what was left of the 1964 World 's Fair grounds . Because she had absolutely no ideas , Audrey thought this was a pretty good one . <p> They got out of the subway at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , walked past the Perisphere and abandoned pavilions . <p> " Here was where we ate Belgium waffles , before you were born , " Ronnie said . " Here was where the General Electric World of the Future was built . " Ronnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . In the distance near the site of the former Vatican pavilion , a group of women and a few men stood aiming their cameras at the sky . <p> " I 'm going to ask them what they were taking pictures of " <p> " Do n't , Mom , " said Audrey , backing off as Ronnie approached a woman in white gloves and a bell-shaped coat . Her mother smiled and did n't seem in the least embarrassed . <p> The woman explained that the Virgin Mary appeared in the cloud formations on the site where the pope had visited the World 's Fair in 1964 . When the pictures were printed , her outline could be seen in the clouds , and she spoke to them through one of their number , a woman who called herself the Holy Voicebox . Audrey was far away , sitting on a park bench , pretending to dump a stone from her shoe . Although Ronnie looked into the sky and saw nothing but clouds , she appeared interested in the woman 's description , nodding if no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We should have brought a camera , " she suggested . <p> " They would n't let us just take pictures of them while they have their cameras aimed at the clouds . They would n't like it , " Audrey said . " They 'd feel like animals in a zoo . " <p> " No , not of them . We could take pictures of the sky , too . See what turns up . " <p> Audrey thought her mother naive . " You ca n't just take pictures of the sky . You have to be part of their group . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Mom , please . " <p> " You mean you have to be in touch with the Holy Voicebox first ? I do n't know why you feel you have to be so careful . " <p> Audrey walked towards another pavilion so as to distance herself from her mother . Although still within eyesight , she wanted to give the impression they were n't necessarily together . She sat on a low swing she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few yards away across cracked concrete , she made out a familiar shape , but she was n't sure how she knew the man . As he straightened up briefly to stretch his back , she recognized the clerk who scared her , the one who told her off . He was eating from a plastic box , huddled over a bench , fork plunging into food , stabbing vegetables , shoving them into his mouth . He looked up again and squinted in her direction . Wiping his hands on his jacket , he angrily shoved the plastic container in a trash can , then walked over . Audrey froze . He was slight but had a presence of continual irritation and affront . She wanted to run away but did n't want to appear to have been so affected by the man that he could scare her off just by looking at her . <p> So we are old friends , I think , " he said . <p> " What ? " <p> " I live near here . Within sight of the Soviet pavilion where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea what he was talking about . <p> " I give you twenty dollars : ' <p> " What for ? " <p> " What for ? You 're a smart girl . You know what is what for . " <p> He reached for Audrey 's arm , stroking it then pulling her by the sleeve . The wool of her baggy jacket made a kind of triangle shape as he yanked . It was an awkward move . He could have grabbed her whole arm but did n't . Audrey slowly pulled her arm away from him as if she were made of gum . She felt she had no will , and everyone she knew was impossibly far away . Responding to her gesture , he pushed her off the swing , causing her to fall to the concrete , but in the shove the swing swept high into the air from his blow and , jangling in its return , clipped him vengefully on the ear . It could n't have caused him much pain , but caught by surprise , he turned red . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " No , you 're the dip who does n't know anything . Who do you think you 're trying to be ? " <p> " The King of Queens , " he yelled at her as he moved off . His pants were short and tight , and despite the cold , he wore no jacket , only a thin sweater and no socks . <p> Audrey lay on the ground , knees in the air , stunned , afraid to move . She did n't know what to do and watched the man retreat farther into the park . This is what she observed : his legs were very white and slightly dirty . Achilles tendons stood out aggressively . A rolled-up magazine was stuck in his hack pocket . At one point he turned back towards her . She got herself up without bothering to dust off her bruises and ran , colliding with the group aimed at the sky . <p> They had taken a break to load more film but were still gazing overhead . Wind blew someone 's veiled hat off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audrey . She grimaced in return , as if to acknowledge she knew she was an interloper . Wind blew leaves around benches , and the abandoned pavilions looked like architectural relics of a lost civilization , ancient , and modernist at the same time . Here was a church of commerce , here was a sort of archive of possibility ; a trash can would be associated with the food ephemera of the tribe who had disappeared . There would be piles of things , utilitarian and vestigial , identified on a whim by a homesick anthropologist . It occurred to her that she might return alone just to see if the cloud formations would mystically align themselves on the film of a nonbeliever . They walked towards the former General Electric pavilion . The group posed , faces upturned , aiming towards the sky . Commissioned by the Holy Voicebox , they seemed to have confidence and a sense of purpose Ronnie envied . They looked like a photograph of a movie audience wearing 3-D glasses , staring mesmerized at the screen . <p> A gust of wind seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were a chorus unable to cohere . <p> " Why do n't you take some notes ? " Ronnie suggested . " Describe what you see . " <p> But idea of the future rooted in these leftovers of a crumbling utopian projection eluded her . " I do n't know how to begin .

She took her mother 's arm , even though she felt too old for such a gesture , clinging and hesitant . <p> " Tell me again about when you arrived in New York . Make up that story again . " <p> " Why ? Are you telling someone you were born somewhere else ? Are you planning a brain transplant ? " <p> Audrey did n't know exactly what to say .
