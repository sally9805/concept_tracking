Banks need banks , just as companies and ordinary people do . But what institution would do serious business with the Bank of Credit &; Commerce International , the rogue financier of crooks , drug lords and con men ? As investigators probe the debris of the vast scandal , the name that most persistently comes up is Bank of America , one of the top five in the U.S. The bank , which co-founded B.C.C.I. in 1972 , takes pains to emphasize that it sold off its stake in the Middle Eastern institution in 1980 . But ties between the two were far more extensive and long lasting than Bank of America has publicly described . Now the San Francisco-based bank concedes that during the 1980s , it handled some $1.3 billion a day of B.C.C.I. money . It held B.C.C.I. deposits at Bank of America branches around the world and maintained two accounts at B.C.C.I. 's Miami office even after B.C.C.I. pleaded guilty to money laundering in 1990 . <P> The two institutions had a symbiotic relationship , according to sources inside B.C.C.I. The corrupt organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global Ponzi scheme to collect deposits , funneling most of its cash in the U.S. into Bank of America accounts . At the same time , the flow of deposits helped prop up the struggling California bank during its hard times in the mid-1980s . " The B.C.C.I. headquarters money always flowed through Bank of America , " says a former B.C.C.I. executive . <P> The two organizations had a strong human link as well , grounded in the friendship between B.C.C.I. founder Agha Hasan Abedi and Bank of America 's A.W . ( Tom ) Clausen , who was chairman during 1970-81 and 1986-90 . When regulators seized B.C.C.I. offices around the world last July , three of the seven directors on its board were former high-ranking Bank of America executives . On that same day , the California bank disclosed that it still had $177.4 million of B.C.C.I. 's money in its accounts . <P> Bank of America says it made plans to sever relations with B.C.C.I. in 1988 . " We decided to withdraw from this business with B.C.C.I. over a three-year period , " says Bank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dollar volume of our B.C.C.I. item-clearing business was reduced by almost two-thirds . " Bank of America , insists Mitchell , had no knowledge of any illegal activity by B.C.C.I. <P> Yet committees in the House and Senate want to know why Bank of America kept doing business with B.C.C.I. in the face of considerable evidence of wrongdoing . " They continued a relationship with B.C.C.I. even after they became aware that B.C.C.I. was indicted in 1988 for money laundering , " said California Republican Frank Riggs at a House Banking Committee hearing . <P> In the hope of gaining entree to Middle Eastern business , Bank of America backed the founding of B.C.C.I. by providing Abedi with $612,000 in seed money and the prestige of the then largest bank in the world . In exchange , the San Francisco bank got 25% of B.C.C.I. 's stock , seats on the bank 's board of directors , and access to Abedi 's extraordinary connections in the gulf states . By early 1974 , Bank of America had boosted its ownership stake to 45%.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
