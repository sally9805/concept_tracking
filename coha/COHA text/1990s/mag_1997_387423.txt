After subjecting a host of containers to onion soup concoctions and Toyota tires , we concluded : There is a difference in the way you carry your water . // For something that looks so clear , water sure is a mystery . It has no calories or nutritional value whatsoever , but you would n't last long on the trail-or anywhere else-without it . Even if all you do is sit still , you should drink eight 12-ounce glasses of water a day . While hiking , experts say you should quaff 5 to 12 ounces every 15 to 20 minutes . That 's a whole lot of water , so you 'll want to keep a steady supply on hand at all times . Which is why one of the most important items to take on the trailnext to the water itself-is a decent container to carry it in . These days , water containers are n't just limited to old leather bota bags and Boy Scout canteens . Now they 're joined by leakproof pull-spout sport bottles and bladder bags that let you carry more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options grow and prices and features vary , it 's hard to know what 's the best basin for your humble H20 . From botas to bladders , from canteens to carafes , I decided to put all the breeds of water containers to the ultimate wet test . A TEST OF STRENGTH Your main concern is durability and watertightness . After all , a leaky container can mean wet clothes , a wet sleeping bag , and nada for you to drink . And if the container splits , cracks , or bursts after you drop , step on , or freeze it , it 's not much good in a far-flung place where clean water is scant . That 's why I subjected all of the chosen containers to a variety of durability tests . First , I filled them three-fourths full of water and let them sit out for three nights in OF weather . When they thawed , I dropped them onto a hard , flat rock from a height of 20 feet . Then I stepped on them , poked at them , and generally whacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bota bags were subjected to an even tougher test . One manufacturer boldly claimed its soft plastic bladder could withstand being squashed by an elephant . I had to know if this claim would , uh , hold water , and since the circus was n't in town , I did the next best thing-lined the bags up in my driveway and backed over them with my Toyota . In fairness , I consider this to be an unduly harsh test and did not expect these products to withstand a trial so far beyond their normal range of use . Amazingly , some did . ( You 'll see which ones in a moment . ) Photograph Wide-mouth bottles , like this Nalgene Lexan , are the way to go for hydrating food and storing leftovers . Photograph Clockwise from lower left : Nalgene Lexan Wide Mouth Bottle , Product Architects Polar Bottle , Nalgene All . Terrain Bottle , and Reliance Camper 's Bottle . Photograph Larger capacity bladder bags , like this MSR Dromedary , can be filled and hung from a tree for easy access in camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding types who expects water to taste and smell like water , you 'll want to consider how readily your container absorbs and hangs onto odors . Many plastic bottles and bags impart a mighty funky flavor and aroma to water , especially if you fill them with sports drinks , lemonade , or iced tea . Even worse : What if you need an airtight place to store that lettover chili until lunchtime tomorrow ? I must not be the nly one who 's finicky about this because manufacturers take pains to point out how their bottles , canteens , or bags do n't give off or absorb funny tastes or odors . To find out , I whipped up the smelliest fluid I could-instant onion soup laced with garlic , oregano , cayenne pepper , and barbecue sauce-and filled every container in this review . I let them sit at room temperature for a few days , rinsed them out , then cleaned them ( see " A Matter Of Taste , " page 59 ) . Finally , I filled them all with cool , clean water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the taste and torture tests . BOTA BAGS Before there were hydration systemsseems to work its way to an uncomfortable place , rubbing or thumping against me or my pack . Finally , because of their small mouths , canteens are hard to clean , making them cozy nests for stale smells and tastes . // Bottle Beta // BOTTLES Bottles come in a wide variety of capacities , geometries , and materials . The size and shape you choose is a personal preference . Wide-mouth bottles make the best sense for winter campers who use them to scoop up snow , and also for those who use them to rehydrate home-dried dinners . Narrow-necked bottles are easier to drink from , whereas pull-spout sport bottles offer the most dribble-free hydration of all , as long as your aim is good . Material is a more objective criteria , however . Some frugal folks swear by the lightweight plastic bottles that store-bought spring water comes in , and those inexpensive bottles work fine for a limited time in warm weather . But they eventually bust or crack , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert when the nearest water source is half a day away . Plastic bike bottles are another tempting alternative because they only cost a couple of bucks . Problem is , they usually leak like mad . Bottom line : When buying bottles , you 're smart to look for watertight , screw-on closures and hard , durable plastics . I subjected a bevy of bottles to the tests , and a handful of reliable winners emerged . Reliance Camper 's Bottle : This nice , basic bottle has ribbed sides , which not only make it easier to handle , but also give it a sturdier feel . The big knobby lid is easy to open , even with gloved or sweaty hands . Nalgene All-Terrain Bottle : This plastic container takes the best features from the bike bottle-the slim shape that slides into pack pockets and the squirt top that directs a river of drink right down the chute-but solves the leakage problem using a watertight screw-on cap with an O-ring around the squirt top . There 's also a plastic mud guard that protects the spout from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caveat , though : While the spout may stay nice and clean , it does have a tendency to freeze up in cold weather . ( The All-Terrain Bottle received an Editors Choice Award in the April 1996 issue . ) Nalgene Lexan Wide Mouth : There are loads of wide-mouth style bottles out there , but Nalgene s Lexan version was the best I could find . Of course it has the standard advantages of the wide-mouth style : The gaping maw makes it easy to store leftover pasta or soup , and the tight , screw-on top ensures a secure seal so you 'll never lose a drop of precious fluid . But what sets it above all the rest is the material . Lexan is a hard plastic with a smoky gray color . It 's nearly impossible to break , and it wo n't skunk up either . After the soup test , a mere rinsing was all this bottle needed to be ready for clean water . To top it all off , the Lexan Wide Mouth comes with units of measurement imprinted on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking . Product Architects Polar Bot tle : If warm water is your pet peeve , an insulated bottle like this one might be the answer . The Polar Bottle sports a shiny , heat-reflective foil layer that 's encased between two plastic walls . I found it kept my water cool for three or four hours longer than the average bottle . The screw-on top prevents leakage , but the pop-up spout is not protected like the All-Terrains , so it tends to get gritty and gunked up . And at 10 bucks , it 's a tad pricey , even for the cold drink it offers . BLADDER BAGS The latest and most expensive of the water widgets , bladder bags are quickly becoming a popular way to haul water on the trail , and with good reason . These supple reservoirs can hold up to four times the water of the average bottle in a lighter , more space-efficient package , which is why many pack manufacturers are designing them into their packs ( Lowe Alpine , Gregory , Dana Design , and Mountainsmith , to name a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube and some kind of valve at the end , so you can attach the bladder to the back of your pack , clip the tube to your collar , and get a drink any time you want . Just open your mouth , bite the valve , and suck . Such convenience takes some getting used to for us dinosaurs who like the old-fashioned way of drinking , but it does ensure that you 'll stay well-hydrated on the trail . Bladders are versatile in their own way . Although you ca n't rehydrate your dried veggies in them like you can with wide mouth bottles , the drink tube can attach to either the spout of a water filter or a backcountry shower spigot . Like the old-fashioned botas , bladders are easy to carry ; they 're soft , ergonomic , and they do n't rub or chafe , especially if you lash them to the back or side of your pack . When you 're not using them , they squish up into nothing . The biggest downside is that bladders tend to retain smells and tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most manufacturers recommend carrying only water in their bladders , which is good advice . None of the following bladders I tried survived the Stink Test . Cascade Designs Platypus : Of all the new hydration systems , Platypus is becoming one of the most popular , and at first glance it 's easy to see why : price ( $3 to $5 per bladder ) and carrying versatility . Platypus offers all sorts of holsters for its bladders , so you can attach them to the backside of your pack or your hipbelt . And when it 's not in use , roll it up and stuff it into your pack . The other nice thing about the Platypus is the pleated bottom that lets it stand up on its own like a bottle . The Platypus fared fine during the Freezer Test , but it did n't stand up to most of the other durability challenges . It broke during the Drop Test , even though it was in its own protective nylon carrier . I stepped on another and it burst . Cascade Designs says they 've beefed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we tested the new version just prior to publication , and it popped like the others in the Drop Test . Then again , if you want bladder bag technology at a price that wo n't suck you dry , the Platypus is a good bet . Just do n't sit on it by accident . ( Note : Cascade Designs stands behind the Platypus with a lifetime guarantee . If you break yours , they 'll replace it . ) Fastrak Systems Camelbak : The Camelbak 's polyurethane reservoir looked pretty flimsy and felt soft and pliable . I figured this bag would n't survive even a cold night . But the Camelbak surpassed every durability test I could muster . By the way , this was the company that claimed its bladder could withstand an elephant . I believe it . I took the 90-ounce reservoir out of its protective pouch , filled it , and dropped it . It just bounced . I swung it against a tree . No effect . I revved up the Toyota and backed over it , then drove over it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did n't pop a seam . It is pricey , though . A complete Camelbak hydration system runs anywhere from $30 to $100 , for example . But I consider it money well spent . This is what I 'll carry my water in from now on . Gregory Mountain Products Mirage Hydro-Cell : Gregory is one of the companies that 's taking the next logical step with hydration systems by integrating them into its backpacks , for which it 's mighty well known . But for those of us who are n't buying new packs , the company also makes individual bladders that can be easily stuffed in a top or side pouch . The Mirage water bladder is big105 fluid ounces-and has a nice mix of strong , lightweight ingredients : a double wall of Mylar and a polyethylene inner liner . The bladder took to being frozen with no problem . And while the Mirage feels flimsy and crinkly-it reminds me a little of a silver birthday balloon-it 's awfully tough . I dropped it twice-with the protective nylon sleeve on and all by its lonesome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leak or dribble . A basic Mirage bladder system-including protective sleeve and tubing-retails for a very reasonable $24 . MSR Dromedary : This gutsy 70ounce bag is made of a tough , coated Cordura that could n't be busted , even when I drove over it . ( The cap did blow off , but when I screwed it back on , the bag still held water ) . The wide cap is compatible with the company 's water filters , and the integrated nylon straps made it easy to lash to a pack . While the cap has a flip-top spout for drinking , it 's not terribly convenient . I 'd love to see MSR outfit this bag to accommodate a drink tube ; then it really would be a match for any hydration system on the market . The larger 10liter version has a tube and spout that make it an excellent in-camp water basin and portable shower in one .

Sometimes it 's the ghosts of drinks or meals past . But more often than not it 's just plain old mildew . Before you pitch that nasty old bottle , try saving it . Here 's how : 1 . Fill bottle with a solution of baking soda and water , and let it soak overnight . Then air-dry for a few hours . 2 . Still stink ? Try a vinegar concoction ( a capful per 2 cups of water ) . Again , let it soak , then dry . This is often a cure-or-kill remedy , since you may end up with containers that make your water taste like salad dressing . 3 . As a last resort , fill ' er up with a diluted bleach solution ( a capful per 2 cups ) , and let it sit for 24 hours . If the smell still sticks , you 've lost the battle . Next time , try a container made of Lexan . It shrugs off weird smells and tastes like a duck sheds water .
