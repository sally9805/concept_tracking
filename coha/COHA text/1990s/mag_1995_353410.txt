The black humor at week 's end around the White House was that terrorists , intruders and pranksters were going to have to get tickets and line up just like the 1 1/4 million tourists who come every year to view and pay homage to the world 's most famous building . <P> In one week 's flurry , the White House became more protected and yet more of a magnet for intrusion . Only three days after Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House was abruptly closed to vehicular traffic as a caution against a truck-bomb attack , the first of two interlopers challenged the security sytem . A troubled graduate student in psychology carrying an old , unloaded pistol climbed the 8-ft. - high iron fence on the east side of the White House on Tuesday night and rushed 60 yds. across the grounds . In the struggle to subdue him , a guard fired a shot that wounded the intruder and a Secret Service agent , each in the arm . Leland Modjeski , 37 , of Falls Church , Virginia , was treated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning concerning his yet unknown motive . <P> On Friday morning unarmed Andrew Jopling , 24 , in front of dozens of astonished tourists who had quietly lined up for their White House tour , hoisted himself over the fence and was immediately and rather quietly handcuffed by officers who hustled him into a guard booth for questioning , believing for the moment that he was just a prankster . Funny ? Perhaps in days gone by , when Eleanor Roosevelt could complain sweetly about couples parking on the untended White House drive for a little smooching . But no more . <P> " It 's the theater , " lamented William Webster , former head of the fbi and a member of the White House security review committee that recommended closing Pennsylvania Avenue as well as a dozen other measures to tighten protection . Angry people seeking notoriety of all degrees find the stage they want at the White House . For years peaceful protesters have sometimes camped across from the White House , but the rising stridency of the disaffected and the real terrorism in the U.S. have changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , William Coleman Jr. , a former Secretary of Transportation , resisted the idea of closing the two-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue when the study was begun after the apparently deliberate crash of a light plane at the mansion last September . " The only way terrorists succeed is to get the government to do something that makes the government look unstable , " declared Webster . " The more you change things , the more they can be encouraged . " During the discussions , when it was pointed out that Chelsea Clinton 's bedroom was on the vulnerable Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House , the first response was to suggest that she be moved to the south side , where the huge lawn is a buffer . But secret reports of threats to the President and his family and the chilling calculations of the damage from a truck bomb were overwhelming . " It had to be done , " said Coleman . " It would have been irresponsible not to have taken the action . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
