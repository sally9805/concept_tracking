What nation locks up the highest percentage of its population ? The Soviet Union ? South Africa ? Guess again : that dubious distinction belongs to the U.S. A report issued last week by the Sentencing Project , a Washington-based public-interest group that advocates reform of sentencing practices , puts the , rate of incarceration at 426 per 100,000 people in the U.S. , 333 in South Africa and 268 in the Soviet Union . It finds that America imprisons black males at a rate four times that of South Africa . <P> The report notes that the American prison population has doubled in the past decade  --  even though the overall crime rate has declined 3.5% . It cites mandatory sentencing laws in 46 states and tougher federal drug laws as the main reasons . Despite $16 billion a year spent on prisoners , claims Marc Mauer , the project 's assistant director , " the same policies that have helped make us a world leader in incarceration have failed to make us a safer nation .
