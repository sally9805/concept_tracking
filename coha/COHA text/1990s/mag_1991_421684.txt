Section : SPENDING <p> It looked like a flashback to the ' 50s as the pack of 24 classic beauties shot down the straightaway for the first of 10 noisy laps . At the wheel of his restored ' 57 Porsche , Don Sandy began dueling it out with the Alfas and Triumphs crowding the pavement , pushing to catch No. 626 , a slick silver Porsche Carrera that was already threatening to live up its nickname : the Silver Bullet . <p> Sandy tried to go for an opening . Whoa ! A ' 59 Porsche cut in front of him . No problem ; he Could handle going sideways . Nobody would run him off the track . These drivers were his comrades ; their rule was " race carefully . " Besides , their cars were too pretty to crash . <p> To the 30,000 spectators at the Laguna Seca Raceway , it looked and sounded like real racing . To a gung-ho competitor like Don Sandy , it even felt like real racing . But he and his fellow road jockeys were all amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workaday Rolodex world  --  chasing each other around the 2.2-mile track for fun and no profit . <p> There are no trophies or cash prizes for crossing the finish line first in this contest . At California 's Monterey Historic Automobile Races , driving to win is considered bad form , even dangerous . It 's the cars , not the drivers , that are the stars of this auto nostalgiafest , and most of them are too valuable and their owners too sensible to consider mere victory worth a $50,000 repair bill , let alone a hospital visit . " I 'm not here to win , " declares Sandy , a 57-year-old award-winning architect . " I 'm here to relax . " <p> The relaxation costs him money , of course : $6,000 a year to race the Porsche seven times a season . But the expenses are minor compared with the gain from his investment . Sandy 's 13 vintage sports cars , which took him 30 years and $206,000 to accumulate and restore , are now worth $700,000  --  an increase of 240% . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun and creates profits too  --  on paper , anyhow . <p> Even with the vintage market softening dramatically  --  as it did in 1990 , when it fell as much as 50%  --  collector cars have appreciated more than 350% from 1981 to today with some , like a 1957 Aston Martin DB5 roadster , rising as much as 1,400% . And the interest in racing these drivable savings accounts has mushroomed right along with the prices . <p> Twenty years ago , U.S. vintage racing comprised a smattering of car buffs who drove their old sports cars to the track , unbolted the mufflers , wheeled around for a few laps , then retired to the pits , drank beer and swapped lies for an evening . Today the sport encompasses 44 clubs and organizations and some 79 racing events a year staged across the country from Pocono , Pa. to Palm Springs , Calif . <p> " This is a Sport where the average Joe can go wheel to wheel with the rich guys and then go into the pits and change the spark plugs with them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collector , driver and partner in the Los Angeles-based Cole-Yacoobian Racing Team . <p> While it does n't hurt to be a millionaire , all it takes is a little driving skill and a $10,000 refurbished Austin Healey Sprite to earn your place in this kinetic museum . And if you do n't want to race but simply want to have fun tooling around in an old sports car , you can get into the game for a lot less , as the table on page 146 shows . <p> The place it 's tough to measure up to the competition is at the very top level of the sport  --  events like the Monterey Historics . The barrier to joining the big boys  --  the people who race real collector cars  --  is the price of their toys . Thanks to inflation , investment fashion and the auctioneers ' hype , collector sports and race cars can now be pricier than beach lots in Malibu , and the scene inside the paddock at Laguna Seca reveals the high stakes . Eighteen-wheeler transports disgorge crews sporting monogrammed polo shirts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ground up " restorations . Meanwhile , on the track , three presumably sane owner-aficionados tear around the course , racing a trio of 1962 Ferrari GTOs worth a combined $30 million . <p> As a consequence , there is tension in vintage racing circles between the enthusiasts and the speculators ; between those who prefer their fun cheap and simple and those who want to spend big money to compete . Don Sandy is a man in the middle of this hobbyists ' tempest . As a collector he 's made a killing . As a racer he 's exercised fiscal self-restraint . Now the questions are : If competing requires spending , how much is too much ? And if winning is irrelevant , how deep into his pockets should he dig ? <p> Don Sandy has always loved cars , European sports cars especially . From the time he was an architectural student at the University of Illinois , his designer 's eye and natural exuberance dictated a racy choice of wheels . He figured , if you 're going to spend the rest of your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His first sports car was a white , wind-in-the-face , 1955 $1,300 Triumph TR2  --  British-made : noisy , leaky and a kick to drive . It was his most prized possession . Pointing the convertible west to seek his fortune in 1958 , Sandy arrived at the Golden Gate with an empty gas tank , $13 in his pocket and an overdue car payment . <p> Today , as the founding partner of Sandy &; Babcock , a respected $11-million-a-year San Francisco-based architectural firm , as a family man with an attractive and intelligent wife , three homes and two beautiful daughters , what he regrets most in life is ... selling that Triumph ! <p> The shift in loyalties occurred in 1959 when he swapped his cherished but topless TR2 for a two-year-old 1957 Porsche 356A Super coupe . It was a case of cheerio Coventry , hello Zuffenhausen . <p> The Porsche was easy to like . Conceived before World War II and first produced in 1948 , the 356 model was essentially a highly evolved Volkswagen Beetle  --  with streamlining . It was robust , sturdy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 79,000 of them from 1948 to 1965 , and even though it was shaped like a Camay soap bar , Sandy thought , " In its own way it 's beautiful . " <p> The romance has endured for 456,000 miles , eight clutches and seven paint jobs . Sandy took the car on his honeymoon with his wife Carol , then used it to commute to the office for the next 10 years . Eventually , as his family grew , the honeymoon car begat a collection of five more secondhand 356s : four coupes ( including one for a bargain $3,500 ) and a $15,000 Cabriolet . <p> Before long , the Sandys were an all-vintage family . Carol drove one of the restored 356s . So did each of the daughters and occasionally his friends . Giving in to the auto-collecting " disease , " as he calls it , Sandy tracked down two more European classics : a $3,500 1956 Austin Healey LM and a 1.972 Ferrari Dino Spyder he picked up for $15,800 . <p> He had cars stored everywhere , including a carpeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't care what kind of car he brought home as long as it was red . " <p> Her husband 's hobby seemed at first like an indulgence . But once his junk turned into jewels , she became a believer . Carol 's only concern these days is that he stay healthy when driving in races , a pastime he was spurred into , ironically enough , by her . <p> As long as Sandy was building his business and raising a family , racing his collection did n't seem prudent or even feasible . Occasionally he 'd take the Ferrari out on 1-5 at dawn and unleash it for a little 160-mph exercise , but that was about it  --  until his 47th birthday . That 's when Carol gave him a gift certificate to the Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving ( then in Sonoma , Calif. ) so he could learn the true art of going fast . <p> She gave him the $250 one-day course , but he liked it so much he ponied up another $1,145 and stayed for four . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my 356 o the track . " <p> The first thing he had to do before competing at Sears Point , the local course , was invest $2,000 to make the car safe for racing . That bought him a new set of brake linings , a roll bar , a harness-type seat belt , and a set of Dunlop racing tires , all of which would cost $4,000 today . For crash protection , he bought an $80 Bell helmet ( currently $200 ) , a $110 Nomex racing suit ( now $300 ) and $35 fireproof Simpson racing gloves ( $70 these days ) . <p> After that , all he had to do was pay the $100 track entrance fee , fill his tank with 112 octane , $1.50-a-gallon racing fuel ( now $2.50 ) , and step on the gas . <p> Because it was vintage racing , there were some constraints on how a competitor could spend money , since the whole idea was to preserve the historical integrity of the cars . " We stress authenticity , " says Steve Earle , the founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're not allowed to rig a 1946 Allard to run like a 1966 Lotus . " <p> Preserving the original factory appearance was important too . There were no body alterations permitted-no flared fenders , spoilers or customized fins . But that did n't mean there were n't some discretionary items in Sandy 's budget . For $3,500 , he rebuilt the motor to the original specs using higher-grade components rods with hardened steel and tougher-grade pistons . But the car 's engine displacement still had to be what it was at the time of manufacture : 1,600cc . <p> Then there were cosmetic and convenience expenditures : a $3,192 interior restoration , a $2,000 paint job , a $1,000 trailer to transport the Porsche to the track and a $9,000 short-bed pickup to tow it . <p> The biggest potential racing-related headache was the matter of insurance , since the rates for protecting collector cars vary according to how and where they 're used . Premiums for simply storing a classic  --  covering it with a tarp and parking it in the barn  --  run about one-half of 1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage , transit and paddock coverage runs about twice that . <p> Putting a 30-year-old car into a four-wheel drift on a crowded racecourse , however , was something else again . Even though vintage racing is basically 70% competition and 30% show , it 's still potentially dangerous ; there has been one death in the U.S. in 400 races over the past five years . <p> The standard on-track policy that is issued through Lloyd 's of London costs a hefty 10% of the value of the car per event . For a $500,000 Ford-powered 1963 C Cobra , that 's $50,000 for a single race . Sandy 's Porsche was worth only $25,000 , but that still meant he 'd be paying about $2,500 in insurance for each race . <p> The solution for him was to " go bare " on the track-race without insurance-and get whatever coverage he could for other times . Fortunately he managed to find an overall policy from J.C . Taylor Insurance that , at an annual cost of $1,100 , covered all his cars during storage and up to 2,000 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars except the Ferrari , that is . Annual fire and theft coverage was all he was willing to buy for that voluptuous beast  --  and that alone cost $1,400 . For races , he would personally have to pay for damages to his car and for his medical expenses , but his entrance fee covered him for liability on a policy issued to the track . <p> During his quest for the perfect 356 Porsche and in his preparation for racing , Sandy tried to keep from going overboard . The son of two Scottish immigrants who knew the meaning of thrift , he says , " I 'm a Midwesterner . I do n't like to throw money away . " <p> What he did like was bargain hunting . Yet the more his architecture business thrived during the ' 80s , the more he was tempted to get into " serious " vintage competition  --  that is , running in yesterday 's open-wheeled race cars : Scarabs and Lolas and other nonproduction machines . The problem ? They cost too much . <p> Twenty years ago a slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $10,000 . Sure , it was gorgeous , but the conventional wisdom at that time was , " It 's just a race car "  --  noisy , temperamental and hard to fix . Now the same Ferrari is the automotive equivalent of a portrait by van Gogh . In 1989 a similar GTO was sold to an anonymous Japanese buyer for $13.7 million . <p> For collectors like Sandy , the spectacular run-up was a two-edged sword . On the one hand it turned his cherished wheels into a valuable " portfolio . " On the other hand , it soon became obvious that the speculators were crowding out the " car nuts " and the connoisseurs . Complains Sandy : " You had guys buying $3 million cars who did n't know where to put the oil in . " <p> Even the cognoscenti who could afford these limited-edition screamers would often " sell " them to their bankers , pocket the cash and then lease them back to drive . They could even risk racing the cars because an accident would n't jeopardize their value . Explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vintage racing coverage : " Most of the cars with any significant race history have all been crashed at one time or another . " Assuming the serial number can be salvaged , says Parish , " there is n't a vintage car competing anywhere that ca n't be totally rebuilt for less than $300,000 . " <p> Thus the high rollers could afford to put their Ferraris on the track . Even without insurance , they knew the worst that could happen to one of their $10 million jewels was they 'd have to pay 3% of the appraised value to restore it . <p> Sandy did n't want to play that game . He wanted more fun for less money . So in 1986 , instead of buying a ridiculously expensive Grand Prix Formula I racer , he settled on a more benign , ridiculously cheap Lotus 18 Formula Junior , which at $5,000 seemed like a steal . <p> The only problem was that he bought the car based on a Polaroid snapshot , and when he took delivery , the body was mashed and parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been impossible were it not for the existence of a certain breed of can-do mechanics willing to engage in the engineering archaeology and custom fabricating that restoring these rarities requires . The talented ones at places like Phil Reilly &; Co. in Corte Madera , Calif. have plenty of work . The shop has no sign on the door and does no advertising . They do business only with people they like , and they 've got a year 's backlog . <p> The wizard that Sandy found to work on his Lotus was a $50-an-hour independent named Steve Patience-the kind of guy who , if you gave him a set of plans , could build you an automobile . It eventually took $35,000 to get the body and engine in shape , but even that was n't enough to replace everything . On one outing at Sears Point , Sandy was going into Turn 6 doing 90 when the lock ring separated from the rear half shaft . Translation : the wheel fell off . The car rolled over . Fortunately , Sandy only dislocated his shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running , Sandy is still ahead on his Lotus restoration . He 's got $40,000 invested in the scaled-down racer , and he 's been offered $70,000 for it . What 's more , the car 's value is enhanced by running in today 's races , especially the Super Bowl of vintage racing , the Monterey Historics . <p> It was the week before the Historics , and Don Sandy was not having a wonderful day . Steve Patience had called to say that when he 'd opened the transmission on the Lotus , the synchromesh was in pieces and there simply was n't enough time remaining to get it ready for the big race . Then Sandy 's Porsche mechanic reported that he 'd finished installing the new gas tank , but he had n't been able to find a specialized fitting to couple it to the fuel line . No coupling , no gas . No gas , no race . <p> Meanwhile , Sandy had arranged to sit in on a get-acquainted meeting at his San Francisco office with a group of prospective VIP design clients from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before , and when the visitors spied the Porsche grease under the chairman 's fingernails , they looked at him like they figured he was making extra money after hours working at a gas station . The architect had to show them a blowup photo of his car to make sure they understood that his hobby was car racing , not pumping gas . <p> Somehow , by the time the three-day Monterey event rolled around , the crucial $6 coupling for the fuel tank had materialized , and he and Carol were able to tow No. 356 to the track . As usual , by the afternoon of their race , they had other things to worry about . Since Sandy had blown his No. 1 engine during his last outing , he was using his backup power plant  --  the original " honeymoon " motor  --  and it did n't seem to have the same oomph . <p> What 's more , one of the other favorites in his heat , Peter Pearce in his Silver Bullet , was running a lot faster than Sandy 's 356 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heftier motor with 140 horsepower to Sandy 's 90 . As if that were n't a sufficient distraction , while Don and Carol waited in the pits for his race to be called , a competitor driving a Lotus 18 , similar to Sandy 's other race car , had his suspension break in Turn 4 and hit the wall doing 70 mph . The driver had to be cut out of his cockpit and ferried to the hospital in an ambulance . The Sandys had no way of knowing the guy had only broken a leg . <p> A few moments later , all this did n't seem to matter . Sandy was squealing through the turns , tearing down the straightaway at 100 mph , dicing through traffic , free of any thoughts about payrolls or Japanese clients . This was what the money and the hassles were all about camaraderie , beautiful machinery , and 20 minutes ' worth of adrenaline and sweat . <p> Guzzling from a water jug after the race , Sandy , who placed seventh out of 24 cars , traded quips with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it felt like traveling sideways when he was supposed to go straight . Everybody acknowledged that the Silver Bullet had blown them all off the track , but so what ? The " winner " had a $100,000 engine , and Sandy had a $25,000 car . <p> Carol kidded him about the honeymoon motor maybe not being what it once was . " Thanks a lot , " joked Don . But he did n't care .
