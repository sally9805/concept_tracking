An elderly man develops macular degeneration , a disease that destroys vision . To bolster his failing eyesight , he receives a transplant of healthy retinal tissue  --  cloned from his own cells and cultivated in a lab dish . <P> A baby girl is born free of the gene that causes Tay-Sachs disease , even though both her parents are carriers . The reason ? In the embryonic cell from which she was cloned , the flawed gene was replaced with normal DNA . <P> These futuristic scenarios are not now part of the debate over human cloning , but they should be . Spurred by the fear that maverick physicist Richard Seed , or someone like him , will open a cloning clinic , lawmakers are rushing to enact broad restrictions against human cloning . To date , 19 European nations have signed an anticloning treaty . The Clinton Administration backs a proposal that would impose a five-year moratorium . House majority leader Dick Armey has thrown his weight behind a bill that would ban human cloning permanently , and at least 18 states are contemplating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right thing to do , at the right time , for the sake of human dignity , " said Armey last week . " How can you put a statute of limitations on right and wrong ? " <P> But hasty legislation could easily be too restrictive . Last year , for instance , Florida considered a law that would have barred the cloning of human DNA , a routine procedure in biomedical research . California passed badly worded legislation that temporarily bans not just human cloning but also a procedure that shows promise as a new treatment for infertility . <P> Most lawmakers are focused on a nightmarish vision in which billionaires and celebrities flood the world with genetic copies of themselves . But scientists say it 's unlikely that anyone is going to be churning out limited editions of Michael Jordan or Madeleine Albright . " Oh , it can be done , " says Dr. Mark Sauer , chief of reproductive endocrinology at Columbia University 's College of Physicians and Surgeons . " It 's just that the best people , who could do it , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human cells , however , is another matter . Biologists are already talking about harnessing for medical purposes the technique that produced the sheep called Dolly . They might , for example , obtain healthy cells from a patient with leukemia or a burn victim and then transfer the nucleus of each cell into an unfertilized egg from which the nucleus has been removed . Coddled in culture dishes , these embryonic clones  --  each genetically identical to the patient from which the nuclei came  --  would begin to divide . <P> The cells would not have to grow into a fetus , however . The addition of powerful growth factors could ensure that the clones develop only into specialized cells and tissue . For the leukemia patient , for example , the cloned cells could provide an infusion of fresh bone marrow , and for the burn victim , grafts of brand-new skin . Unlike cells from an unrelated donor , these cloned cells would incur no danger of rejection ; patients would be spared the need to take powerful drugs to suppress the immune system . " Given its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertility expert at London 's Hammersmith Hospital , " I would argue that it would be unethical not to continue this line of research . "
