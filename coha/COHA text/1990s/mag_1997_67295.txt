In showing their devotion to those athletes , locals heed a simple rule of decor : If it ai n't painted sky blue , it ai n't painted . // That rule governs the campus too . From the rafters of the Dean E. Smith Center to the track at Fetzer Field to the windows in Woollen Gymnasium , the ubiquitousness of the color is symbolic of just how wide and deep runs the passion for sports . " Athletics is Carolina , Carolina is athletics , " says junior Marion Jones , who is not only an All-America in women 's basketball but also finished fourth in the long jump at the 1995 NCAA track and field championships . " Everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch . " Typical of North Carolina 's students is freshman Robby Spencer , a self-described " sports freak " from Hendersonville , N.C. , who since last fall has attended basketball , football , soccer and volleyball games and has played intramural basketball , soccer , volleyball and Wiffle ball . " That 's all I 've had time for , " he says glumly . // Every school in the country would love to count Michael Jordan . Sam Perkins and James Worth among its alumni . At North Carolina those guys played on the same team . Eight national players of the year have played men 's basketball for the Tar Heels , who have reached 14 Final Fours and won four national titles . Dean Smith is Division I basketball 's winningest coach ( 879 victories and counting ) . Yet men 's hoops might be only the second-most successful athletic program at North Carolina . There have been 15 NCAA championships won in the history of women 's soccer , and the Tar Heels own 13 of them . As for other sports , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field hockey team , three . The women 's basketball team won the 1994 championship game on one of the most memorable plays of the decade , a last-second three-pointer by Charlotte Smith  --  wearing , naturally , number 23  --  that gave the Tar Heels a 59-57 victory over Louisiana Tech . // In recent times the level of intramural and club sports activity in Chapel Hill has threatened to outstrip the facilities . But six years ago students overwhelmingly passed a referendum to raise student fees to build a new , two-level rec center . Last year marked the opening of the new Outdoor Education Center , which otters ropes courses , mountain-bike trails , an 18-hole Frisbee golf course and the longest zipline ( a cable that students ride down , boot-camp style , while hanging from a pulley ) in the U.S. // When students are n't watching one sporting event or playing in another , they can step onto Franklin Street and partake in that most traditional of collegiate activities : the beer lift . Choice seating for basketball telecasts is located at Four Corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense Smith employed before the advent of the shot clock . For games not on local TV , there 's the North Carolina Sports Bar on West Franklin , which has 10 satellite receivers and an area for shooting free throws . // " Athletics on campus was one reason I came here , " says sophomore Regina Healy , the president of the field hockey club . " I wanted to get involved as much as possible , to try to make a big university seem a little bit smaller . " The heavy participation in sports does make 24,439-student North Carolina seem much more intimate and friendly , though as jock schools go , it looms large .
