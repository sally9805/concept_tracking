WHEN HER GOOD FRIEND 'S HUSBAND MADE A PASS AT HER , MARILEE WAS SHOCKED-AND FLATTERED . BUT SHE WAS TOTALLY LOYAL TO HER OWN HUSBAND ... WAS N'T SHE ? // Marilee hurried in from the backyard to grab the ringing phone , the screen door clapping shut behind her . She was worried about squirrels raiding the open bag of birdseed she left on the slate steps , but she forgot that on hearing Hannah 's voice . " Hannah ? How are you ? " Grateful surprise made her sink into a kitchen chair . " Is everything okay ? " " Everything 's fine , except I feel terrible that it 's taken mewhat is it , three months ? - to call you back . I do n't know how it happened . I mean , I do , sort of . We were heading off to the Grand Canyon after we saw you last , and then the kids had to be settled into camp , and then , I swear , the next week was the Fourth of July . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helping her . " But I 've missed you , " Hannah said . " John and I both have . How 's Dennis ? " " Good . Working hard . You know , still determined to set a record for making partner faster than anyone in the history of law . " The joke was mild , but it was enough to elicit Hannah 's click , staccato laugh , the one Marilee always counted on to cheer her up . Hannah and Marilee and their husbands had been a regular foursome over the years , socializing together almost every weekend . It had been strange not to have heard from Hannah recently , and Marilee had tried not to he hurt hy it , but she was . " Listen , we have to catch up , " Hannah was saving . " Can you guys come to brunch ? How 's next Sunday ? " " I think that 's fine , " Marilee said . Of course , she 'd have to double-check with Dennis , and what could she bring , and could Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit ? THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON , AS SHE REFILLED THE BIRD feeders , ran loads of laundry , and finished some paperwork for the office , Marilee thought about Hannah and John . It had been wonderful and rare to have met a couple with whom she and Dennis clicked so easily . It helped , for logistics , that Hannah and John 's kids were old enough to make their own plans , and she and Dennis did n't have children yet . The four of them could always agree on a movie , and their ideas about what constituted a good meal and how much to pay for it were happily similar . She recalled their outings at crafts fairs and film festivals , on hikes and bike rides . Always , they were talking among the four of them ; not like other couples , where the wives stuck together and so did the husbands , speaking their separate languages . It reminded her of the uncomplicated camaraderie of friendships she 'd known as a child , when her gang was boys and girls together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that develop later . When Hannah had disappeared these last months , not responding to several messages Marilee had left on her answering machine , Marilee had n't pushed , and she wondered now if that had been a mistake . She remembered thinking , the last few times she had seen them , that , somehow , Hannah and John had gotten out of step with each other , had seemed tense , as if they 'd just had a fight . At the time , Marilee had ignored the signs , but after Hannah had stopped calling , all the little footprints in the sand loomed in her mind . The thought that Hannah and John might be having problems had scared her . She had n't wanted to know about it , whatever it was . They were her friends as a couple , and she did n't want to hear about John 's sins from Hannah , or Hannah 's sins from John . And she worried that whatever virus of discontent they had caught , she and Dennis could catch it too . THE BACK DOOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from his Saturday afternoon basketball game . Marilee went into the kitchen and watched as he stripped off his sweaty socks in the mudroom . " Good game ? " she asked . He looked up , his face still steamed red . " No broken bones . " She waited a beat , enjoying the sight of him in his cutoffs . Then she said : " Guess who called ? " " Hannah , I 'd say , from the way you 're smiling . " She should n't be surprised . She 'd spent more than a few nights speculating with Dennis about why Hannah had dropped out of sight . " So , why 'd she say she did n't call ? " " Just got busy . " // He smiled . " I told you , honey . But you would n't believe it from me . " She grinned back . " I do n't believe it from her , either . " THE BRUNCH WAS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY . Hannah served a delicious broccoli soup and mushroom quiche . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked terrific , Marilee and Dennis agreed . They had , all four of them , laughed and chattered excitedly through the meal , catching up on news . All their old chemistry was still there , to Marilee 's relief . When Hannah got up to clear the table , John started to help her , but Marilee insisted on doing it . The truth was , she wanted a moment alone with Hannah . She followed her into the kitchen , carrying a stack of dishes . " This is so wonderful . It 's so good to see you both , " she said , as Hannah loaded the dishwasher . " Can you forgive me for being so neglectful recently ? " Hannah asked . This time , her tone on the subject was less breezy , more mournful , Marilee registered . " Of course . Do n't mention it again . Unless there was something I , or we , did or said that upset you ... ? " " Oh , no . Nothing like that . " Not like that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might tell her what had gone on these three months , but not yet , not today . John came into the kitchen , carrying the last of their utensils . He 'd lost weight , she noticed , gotten a little grayer-or had she just forgotten ? - but it suited him . She imagined that more than one of his university students must swoon over him , with his green eyes and strong jaw , and his air of almost priestly focus when he listened to you talk . He came up behind Hannah at the sink , deposited some glasses , and kissed the top of her head . " Can I steal Marilee away from you for a minute and show her the new bird feeders ? " he asked . " She and I were always the most serious birders of the group , after all . " " Of course . But do n't dawdle . I 'm putting on the coffee , " Hannah said , as John led Marilee out the back door . " I added a cardinal feeder . And a squirrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making his way across the yard and pointing to a barrel wrapped around the base of a pole , at the top of which hung a feeder . " The squirrels charge up from the bottom , then get stopped inside the barrel . They come back out looking awfully confused . I feel a little sorry for them , but the cardinals are grateful . " " You still have that same pair coming around ? " Marilee asked . " Absolutely . Whenever I spot him , she 's no more than twenty feet away , and vice versa . " It was a sweet day . The perfume of newly mown grass hung in the air . The clinging vine on a trellis was bursting with scarlet roses . The deck looked like it had been freshly varnished . Marilee knew John 's teaching schedule allowed him to he busy around the house in the summer ; with Dennis 's job , they could always afford to hire laborers for their projects , but never had the satisfaction of doing the work themselves . " The yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So do you . " She blushed . " Oh , thanks . Well ... " she trailed off , embarrassed , surprised . " Hannah missed you , " he said . " But I did too . In an entirely different way . " It was as if she felt the earth stop rotating , felt the clouds stand still in the sky . His words were all wrong . " That 's why , " he went on , looking down , gently kicking at the grass , " these last few months , I 've been kind of on edge . Hannah did n't know what was wrong . I do n't think she meant to shut you out , but some instinct made her circle the wagons , and , of course , I could n't blame her . " " John- " " Please , let me finish . It 's been so hard to find the nerve to begin . " She glanced nervously across the yard at the kitchen window . She could n't see Hannah because of the glare of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning , fussing , making the coffee . Perhaps Dennis had come in to help her and was standing at the sink now , watching them out here . She should bolt , she should just walk away . " I did n't mean to feel this way , " John was saying . " I thought I was happy in my marriage . But when we 'd have plans to see you both , I 'd be excited , like a teenager on a date . When there were more and more weekends when we did n't see you , the feeling faded a bit , and things went back to normal between Hannah and me , more or less . " He was whispering now . " I found I started to forget the details-the way your eyes are gray or blue , depending on the light , how you have that dimple on just one side when you smile . It helped to forget , actuallymy life went back to being easy . I thought it would be safe to see you again . " Marilee felt frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , I do n't want to hear any more . Yet she remained silent . " But I was wrong , " he said , looking at her intently . " It was n't safe . " She was pulled into his gaze . Her mouth went cottony with fear . " This is n't the right place to go on , " he said . " I was hoping we could meet for lunch , just the two of us . You do n't have to answer me now . Call me at my office . Anytime . But soon . " " The yard looks great , John , " she said again . Then she swung away and headed back to the house . IT ' WAS ODD AND SICKENING TO HAVE A secret from Dennis . They did not , in their seven years of marriage , have secrets from each other . But she could n't , would n't , tell him this , Marilee swore , as she tossed groceries into her shopping cart . Could n't because it would destroy the friendship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and who was John to go smashing it all up ? She wheeled down the soup aisle , then realized there was already soup in her basket . She was n't concentrating . More important , she would n't tell because Dennis would be hurt , angry . He was a proud man , for one thing , and she could n't say for sure that he would n't track down John and deck him . But there was more .... Would Dennis wonder , in some jealous recess of his heart , if she had somehow encouraged John in his feelings ? And that was the thought that troubled her the most , that startled her even , the way you might recoil at unexpectedly finding something sharp tucked in your pants pocket What if she had encouraged John without realizing it ? She certainly had n't meant to . But then , she 'd had those admiring thoughts about John in the kitchen that day at brunch , had n't she ? Appraising his looks and imagining the swooning students ? Could she be lying to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She pitched two bags of frozen vegetables into her cart . Maybe it just was n't healthy , spending all that time with another couple . Maybe she and Dennis should have been focusing on themselves more . Maybe she 'd been so busy telling herself that the four of them were like a carefree litter of puppies , male and female , mindlessly tumbling over one another , that she somehow had n't realized she was sending John signals . But this was crazy thinking . John was an attractive man , but she had n't been entertaining a single thought of the kind he spilled out to her in the backyard . He was her friend 's husband ! And besides , she loved her own husband . She and Dennis had gotten each other through her father 's death and his sister 's terrible car accident . She saw him through law school , and he saw her through a miscarriage a year ago . These were things that went deep , that were the stuff of love . They were , she thought sometimes , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages , too , and morethey were nearly ten years older and had two great kids together . How could John be thinking of risking it all over some silly crush on her ? And why could n't she get the thought of his confession out of her head ? " ANYTHING LEFT FOR DINNER ? " DENNIS asked , coming through the door an hour later than he had promised . He was yanking at his tie as he entered the kitchen . " Hon ? Did you hear me ? Anything left ? " She was just hanging up the phone after speaking with her mother , who was taking driving lessons for the first time at 64 ; before Marilee 's father died , he had driven her everywhere . " You have two lamb chops and a baked potato sitting in the microwave , " she told Dennis crisply . " It was nice and hot an hour ago , when I sat here and ate by myself . " " Marilee , please . I 'm exhausted . Do n't you think I 'd rather have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal ? " " Sometimes I do n't know anymore . You do n't seem able to tear yourself away from the office . " She felt the sting of tears and was surprised-she had n't realized she was that upset . " Wallace walked into my office just as I was packing up . Ile wanted to go over the case . " He was at the microwave , pushing buttons . " Would it be unheard of to tell him you had plans and would talk to him in the morning ? " " You know it does n't work that way . Now , what 's the matter , really ? " He came and sat down across from her at the table , folding his hands and smiling his I-don't-want-to-fight smile . What 's the matter , really ? Nothing she could admit to-just a dozen little things , like that he watched too much TV , talked to her too little , played too much basketball with the guys on weekends , never gave a thought to presents ( just told her to pick out something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pleasure in bed for granted . Most of these issues were not new ; she 'd even known about some of them before they were married . But what started out as funny and endearing little idiosyncrasies somehow , over the years , had turned into irritations . And they made her wonder : Is this what a happy marriage feels like ? Is this happy enough ? Are other people happier ? " Nothing else is the matter , " she said . " I just missed you at dinner . I 'd like to have you home more . " " I know . Me too . I 'm here now , though , " he said , kissing her quickly before heading back to the microwave . A RECEPTIONIST PUT MARILEE ON HOLD after she 'd asked for John . Her throat felt tight , her cheeks flushed . But all she was doing was calling to clear the air , set John straight , so the four of them could go on being friends . Neither Hannah nor Dennis needed to know , and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the panel of imaginary judges in her head . " Marilee ? " John came on the line , his tone silky . She realized she had n't ever talked to him on the phone before . All her planning had been done with Hannah . " I 'm so glad you called , " John said . " So . . . relieved . " " It 's not what you 're hoping , John , " she said briskly . " I just thought it was important for us to talk . I 'd like to be able to continue the friendship the four of us have , and we ca n't , with ... with what you said hanging between us . " As she was saying it , she wondered for the first time what he could have had in mind as a plan . Did he imagine they 'd have an affair even as the four of them got together for chummy dinners ? " No , you 're right . Of course we have to talk . But just now I 'm heading into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Besides , the phone is wrong for this . Meet me for lunch tomorrow . Please . At noon . There 's a place near school . " Inside she was saying : No , there 's not enough to say over lunch ; it wo n't take me more than a minute to tell you to stop , that I love Dennis and am loyal to him . But even as she was thinking this , John 's voice was pouring into her ear , giving her the address of the restaurant , and she heard herself agreeing to meet him . HER MOTHER HAD HAD A FENDER BENDER during her fourth driving lesson , and Marilee was questioning her about the details . " Well , I do n't know exactly how it happened , " her mother was saying . " I was going the speed limit . I had my blinker on , and this other car just came zooming out of nowhere . My instructor did n't see him either-you know they have the second brake on the passenger side , and even he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're all right ? " Marilee asked . " Yes , just embarrassed , mostly . I thought I was doing so well . " " I 'm sure you are . That kind of thing can happen even to an experienced driver . " Marilee was trying hard to concentrate-this was serious , after all-but she had n't been able to think about anything all day except that she had agreed to lunch with John . A dozen times she thought to call him back and cancel . She found she couldn't-but she also knew she should n't go ahead with the lunch . Part of her fear was that she did n't know if she could completely trust herself . " Mom , " she blurted , " did you ever want to be with any other man besides Dad ? " She held her breath . She could hardly believe she 'd asked it . She had been only thinking it , and now it was out of her mouth , just a hair away from a full confession-but of what , exactly ? " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abrupt change of subject , she did n't let on . " But if you 're asking me , did I ever think another man was more attractive , charming , or interesting than your dad-sure . And I fully expect your father felt the same about me sometimes . Even so , it 's a long way from there to wanting to be with someone else . Your father was always the best man for me-and I never thought that meant he had to he perfect . " " Oh , " Marilee said , lost in her thoughts . How far , exactly , was it from thinking to wanting " Why , honey ? " " No reason . You know how you wonder sometimes ? " Marilee tried frantically to think how to change the subject . " Hmmm , " her mother said . " I think your generation thinks too much . Because , you know , you ca n't analyze yourself into happiness , but you sure can talk yourself out of it if you keep turning things over and over in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hurt today , Mom , " Marilee said . " Promise me you 'll be more careful . " " I will , honey . And you promise me too . " MARILEE ARRIVED AT THE RESTAURANT early . She parked across the street and watched people come and go . It was an attractive place , with low-hanging green awnings , a brick front , and window boxes swelling with begonias . It was the perfect place for a seduction - and that 's exactly what John was planning ; there could be little doubt about that . Last night in bed , with Dennis asleep beside her , Marilee had let her mind run wild , finally let herself imagine the forbidden . She envisioned herself in John 's arms , saw him kissing her eyelids , temples , lips . She saw him unbuttoning the top button of her blouse .... She had been stirred , and she thought about waking Dennis , telling him : I need you to stop being so distracted and make me the center of your world the way you used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't woken him , and she had n't banished her fantasy or canceled the lunch , and that was why she was here , now , in her parked car , watching for John . Then she saw him , turning the corner , walkinfg swiftly , without hesitation , his hands in the pockets of his tweed blazer . She watched as he opened the restaurant door and disappeared inside . She could go in , she could follow . She could stick to her original plan and tell him to get a grip on himself for all their sakes-for Hannah 's , in particular . Then they could have back their former , fairweather friendship . But that was no longer possible , she saw now . It was like a drop of dye in a clear pool ; even diluted , it had changed everything . She did not want John . She hardly knew him , she felt now . She did want what she had felt last night , but she wanted it with Dennis . And she and Dennis had felt it , over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty of disappointing her occasionally , but he was also the man who knew exactly when she needed a back rub , brought her breakfast in bed when they were on vacation , had just offered to take her mother out for extra driving lessons , broke down and cried the day he told his parents about her miscarriage . He was her husband , after all , and she loved him . But more than that , she told herself , he 's the best man for me . And she looked straight ahead as she turned the key in the ignition and headed home . Author Affiliation Diane Salvatore is Good Housekeeping 's Executive Editor . // <p>
