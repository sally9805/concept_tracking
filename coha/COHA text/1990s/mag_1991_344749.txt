In their own way , male and female teens are alike . They dress uniformly in jeans and T shirts , speak the same hip argot and sport identical hairstyles . Both sexes can drive parents crazy . But while teen girls have stacks of glossy magazines devoted to their interests , boys have made do with car mags , sports publications and backpacking monthlies . Now the unconscionable neglect of the social male teen has ended . Dale Lang , owner of Sassy , the irreverent and successful magazine for female teenagers , has driven across the gender gap with Dirt , a magazine for " L.A. hip-hoppers , guys from the New York club scene or boys in Alabama who are into heavy metal , " in the words of one editor . <P> Getting Dirt into the right hands  --  the target age is 14 to 20  --  was a matter of finding out where the boys are . The first issue has been given savvy packaging as a separate 23-page supplement to the September copy of Sassy ( total paid circ. 631,000 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its editorial page urges them to " please give the enclosed Dirt to a guy . " In fact , more than 100,000 male teens were already reading Sassy , whose lunchroom lingo  --  " icky " is an acceptable adjective  --  and chatty tone have made it a solid hit . <P> " What makes Sassy special , " a teen reader told Lang and the magazine 's staff , " is that when I read it , it 's like talking to my best friend on the telephone . " Dirt will speak to teen boys the same way , says Lang , but in a male voice . That will mean a cool collection of fiction , short takes about school , sports , art and  --  yes  --  articles about girls . Sample headline : HEY , BABY , WHAT 'S YOUR SIGN ? AN IDIOT 'S GUIDE TO FIRST DATES . Another refreshing notion : Sassy treats male teens as people  --  not jerks or hunks  --  and that respect for the opposite sex will cross over to Dirt . <P> To dish up Dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up an all- male staff on the West Coast . The editor in chief is Mark Lewman , 24 , a.k.a . Lew . He and Dirt 's art director , Andy Jenkins , 27 , and photo editor , Spike Jonze , 21 , got to know one another while working at Freestylin ' , a Los + Angeles-based bicycling magazine . Their own publication , Homeboy , which Lewman calls " a skateboard magazine with everything from dance techniques to recipes , " folded after six issues , but the threesome had honed their skills . As for other qualifications , Dirt 's introductory editorial points out that all three are former teenagers . <P> Dirt will have a limited newsstand test in late October , and the premier issue will be available next spring . The current Dirt is crammed with dark graphics and dense type . Articles range from a 23-year-old convict 's account of life in an urban gang to Lewman 's good-grooming checklist . Shampoos , he notes , are recommended " before school pictures and whenever your hair looks stupid . " <P> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been bumpy . At its 1988 start-up , the magazine 's frank material  --  the pros and cons of virginity , for example  --  drew the fire of the Moral Majority , and advertisers turned shy . They returned after the magazine softened its controversial profile .
