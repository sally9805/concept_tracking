When I was teaching my son about the rules of baseball , I learned some larger lessons about life BY BOB KATZ // MY SON , LOUIS , IS A TIMID KID , reluctant to join in group activities and shy around the clusters of rambunctious boys who set the tone at the local playground . During his first years of school , he rarely engaged in recess activities , preferring to quietly observe the noisy frolic of others . When I asked if he would n't be happier participating , he soberly replied , " It 's okay . I have lots of things to think about . " Needless to say , I worry about him . So early last spring , when he was 8 , I seized on the notion that a team sport like baseball might be beneficial . It instills pride in performance , and functions as a veritable primer in the cornerstone virtues of our Republic . Most important , though , it breeds camaraderie . In our town , second graders play in a Farm League , defined by slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no official score keeping . It 's appropriately low-key . I broached the matter delicately , not wanting to be pushy . Louis 's decision to sign up was entirely his own , and a happy surprise . Before the first game , I coaxed him into a few sessions of backyard practice . My goal was simply to provide a handful of basic skills so he would n't feel inept and instantly quit . Honestly , I did n't care if he excelled or even if he was average . We bought a stiff leather mitt , a Tom Glavine model with the Grip-Tite Pocket , and oiled it up . He learned to catch my gentle lobs , displaying a surprising facility for snagging the ball backhanded . His throwing , once he got the knack of bending his elbow and snapping his wrist , developed nicely . Hitting came with difficulty , but he did master where on the bat to hold his hands , and how to assume a stance . Heck , he would n't be the first all-glove , no-stick prospect . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first inning of the first game , Louis sits out . Which does n't seem to bother him . On the sideline , in his smart maroon jersey and matching cap emblazoned with a big white G , for Gators , he cheers enthusiastically for his hapless teammates . In the second inning , he is inserted as a batter . He looks tiny and lost up there at the plate , and I wish we 'd spent more time on hitting fundamentals . The Farm League permits five swinging strikes before you 're declared out . With each of Louis 's whiffs , my torso heaves reflexively . After the last strike , I slump dejectedly , bracing myself against the chain link backstop . But Louis is n't at all discouraged . When it 's his turn to take the field , he scampers merrily out to his assigned position , third base . He acts pleased in precisely the way I had hoped . He 's part of the team , unself-conscious . The first kid up hits a soft line drive between third and short . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or since , Louis lunges sideways , glove desperately outstretched , tumbling downward into the dirt . Miraculously , he comes up with the ball ! // Everyone on our side erupts in cheers . Nonchalantly , Louis dusts himself off and tosses the ball to the pitcher , as if he has been making that play his entire career . A mom sidles up to me and says admiringly , " And he 's not even gloating over it . " Indeed , while I 'm practically glowing with pride , he shows not even a flicker of celebration . The game winds down . Nobody actually keeps score so everybody , Gators and Eagles alike , is reasonably happy . Except Louis . On the ride home , he 's uncharacteristically cranky and sullen . I try to assure him he played great , but he 's too despondent to listen . Finally , it spills out in a cascade of grief . The amazing catch he made was , in his mind , a trapped ball . It nicked the ground before entering his glove . He thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleads , eyes softening with tears , " how 'd you feel if they said you won a contest and gave you a million dollars , but in your heart you knew you were n't really the winner ? " I 'm stunned . I want to console him , but how ? Tell him that life is strewn with ill-deserved bad calls and he should be grateful for any that go his way ? Point out that bona fide big-league players actually practice ways to deceive the umpires , and here he has managed it on his very first play ? Who wants to break the news to an 8-year-old that the world routinely operates on such a woefully uneven moral system ? Of course , I 'm proud of my son 's innate sense of integrity . But I 'm also filled with apprehension . What will become of a boy who feels something like this so deeply ? Neither sports nor life taught me that honesty is its own reward . In fact , they often teach the opposite : the considerable advantages to be gained by slyly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treacherously complex . Just like my son . His sensitivity has jolted me back to an innocent time when I was young and sensitive , and the world looked to be a newly mowed ball field governed by neat white lines and an impartial umpire . A dark truth , I fear , underlies Louis 's anguish , but I 'm not up to the task of explaining it . Instead I say , " It 's only a game . " And I 'm happy Louis lets me leave it at that .
