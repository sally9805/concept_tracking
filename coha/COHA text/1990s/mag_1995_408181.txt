All things are artificial , for nature is the art of God .  --  Sir Thomas Browne Three days before Christmas last year , on an afternoon train from New Haven to New York , I found myself sitting opposite a woebegone young man in his late twenties who seemed so alarmed by the direction of his own thoughts that I was reluctant to unsettle him further with a careless remark about Newt Gingrich or the weather . I took him to be a student in one of the Yale graduate schools , but by his appearance I could n't guess at the topic of either his dissertation or his unhappiness . He was wearing blue jeans , a worn but once well-tailored overcoat , and the remnant of a gray cashmere sweater . His round and naturally pleasant face was gaunt and drawn , and although the melancholy expression in his eyes suggested the possibility of an unpublished poet , he could just as easily have been studying law or architecture . We were among the few passengers in an unheated car , and during the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window at the rain , his hands thrust dejectedly into the pockets of his coat . When at last he chose to speak , he did n't turn his head . The obliqueness of the statement surprised me less than its hollow tone . " You know , of course , " he said , " what they can do to mice . " I did n't know  --  either which they or what mice  --  but I understood that my companion had been asking himself a series of questions for which he had found no good answers and that his observation followed from a dismal line of reasoning that he no longer could suppress . " It 's Christmas , " I said . " The end of the year . The fin de sicle . Everybody 's depressed . " He ignored the remark as an irrelevance , and as he shifted the angle of his gaze , I could see that he was calculating the precise degree of my probable ignorance . " Have you ever heard the term " germ-line cell therapy ' ' ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human embryos are lying around in cold storage ? " I said that I had heard rumors about the human embryos but had assumed that most of them were harmless . he young man regarded me with a superior smile , as if from a cold and condescending height . Identifying himself as a doctoral candidate at the Yale Divinity School , he asked me whether I had noticed either of the two reports published on the front page of the New York Times within the space of the last six reeks , one of them about experiments with the sperm cells of mice at the University of Pennsylvania , the other about a mouse inflated with a gene causing it to become grotesquely obese . I remembered the photograph of the fat mouse , which had a bow around its neck and looked to be about the size of a pet rabbit . " If they can eliminate the gene for obesity , " he said , " it 's only a matter of time before they can eliminate the gene for sloth . " Before the train reached Bridgeport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sciences was by no means good . He had been diligently collecting journal articles about transgenic fish and children born to their grandmothers , also newspaper dispatches about the molecular rearrangement of cows and dinosaurs soon to be hatched from old rocks . The new biological world order , he said , was much nearer in time than anybody supposed . Becoming suddenly animated and beginning to wave his hands , he lurched into a projection of the life forms likely to inhabit the next millennium . " Synthetic salmon as big as killer whales , my friend . Huge and omnivorous creatures devouring all the minor fish in the Gulf of Alaska . Mutant tomatoes as round as basketballs . Insects in the shape of parakeets . Chickens crossed with rats or Quentin Tarantino . " Apparently what troubled him was the prospect of a world from which all traces of human imperfection had been removed , like mud on a boot or stains on a rug . Who then would have need of his services ? Of what use was the Old or New Testament among people bred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company ? " Perhaps you can explain to me , " he said , " the point of preaching sermons to people who look like " Yoda and know nothing of sin and remorse . " " Journalists like to write about miracles , " I said . " They exaggerate things . " The young man dismissed the objection with an abrupt and impatient gesture , and between Bridgeport and Darien he summed up the result of his research in so rapid a rush of words that I had trouble keeping track of the distinctions between " xeno-grafts " and " the genome project , " between the " polymerase chain reaction " and Cenozoic insects preserved in beads of amber . Other passengers came and went , but the divinity student took no notice of them , and he never once was at a loss for another terrible sign or portent looming just below the biomedical horizon . In the station at Stamford he mentioned the two hundred genetically engineered organisms released into the environment over the last ten years ( all of them suspect and some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pretensions of literary theorists . " At Yale , " he said , " people think deconstruction is something that happens in the English department . " And then , with scornful laughter , " Guys in beards writing commentaries about Proust . They think of themselves as revolutionaries . " But it is the cellular biologists , he said , who revise the texts of human meaning , adding or deleting gene sequences like semicolons . By the time the train entered Westchester County , the divinity student had worked himself into so agitated a state of mind , part despairing prophecy and part antic improvisation , that he had attracted the respectful attention of three teenage girls wearing red woolen caps that made them look like Christmas elves . The apocalyptic tenor of his remarks followed from his assumption that within a matter of not too many years the wonders of corporate science would bring forth a market in genetic home improvements ( intelligence , skin color , athletic ability , etc. ) as profitable as the market in cosmetics . " If I can give my dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " why ca n't I do the same for my daughter ! " As long ago as February 1993 , he said , the United States government approved the patenting of new life forms , and by so doing granted genetic engineers the right to own specific traits and characteristics . The Patent Office 's ruling pertained to animals , but in view of the 1980 Supreme Court decision that the patent laws refer to " anything under the sun made by man , " the divinity student foresaw the arrival of the biomedically engineered Eden in three stages , all of them brief . First , the deployment of the genetic codes to fend off hereditary diseases . Identify the gene for obesity or breast cancer , remove it from the embryo , and thus preserve the child from at least one of the scourges of the flesh . Next and not long afterward , the molecular biologies made to serve the pleasures of the rich . Philip II of Spain collected dwarfs , and what was to prevent the latter-day lords of creation  --  Michael Jackson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting centaurs or two-headed golfers or miniature reproductions of Henry Kissinger ? The divinity student could imagine private zoos in Colorado ; limited editions issued by the Franklin Mint ; bizarre auctions under the chandeliers at Sotheby 's . Last , once the techniques had become both reliable and cheap , the better drug- and department stores selling celebrity-sponsored sperm cells as if they were shades of lipstick . The masculine and feminine ideals of beauty no longer would need to be left to chance , and instead of taking up the questions of faith and conscience , people would graze like sheep among the displays of attractively designed tubes , priced at $49.95 and filled with genetic reprints of Elizabeth Taylor 's eyes or Frank Sinatra 's voice . " Who will want to listen to the word of God , " he said , " when they can change themselves into whales or movie stars ? " The three girls looked at him in amazement , obviously thrilled with the news of their deliverance . At the station in New Rochelle he train stopped for nearly ten minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exigesis apparently had exhausted him without relieving him of his depression . He stared bleakly at the passengers crowding through the doors , most of them noisily excited with the hope of a festive evening in the city , and I wondered what I could say to him that might bring him some small measure of holiday cheer . He was undoubtedly overstating the speed of scientific advancements ( as well as confusing the practice of genetics with the theory of eugenics ) , but if I was sure that the new biomedical dispensation would arrive at a much later date than he supposed , I was also sure that on his principal existential point his fears were well founded . The pitiless logic of the capital markets eventually would overrule the moral objections from the sentimentalists in the choir loft . The Pope and Pat Buchanan might rail against the blasphemy of commercial mutation , but the bioengineering industries already have invested as much as $30 billion toward the manufacture of improved human beings , and too much money stands to be made from the sale of a heart-shaped mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divinity student with psalms , at least I could console him with assurances about the vanity and greed of his fellow man . I remembered that the Yale Divinity School had been founded in a very strict and Puritan tradition , and the faculty possibly had neglected to introduce the young man to the writings of the more sardonic authors . I suspected that he had read too much of Thomas Aquinas and not enough of Voltaire ; too much Martin Buber and John Bunyan , not enough Mark Twain and Ambrose Bierce . " Have faith in Mammon , " I said , " and trust to the quibbling of lawyers . Rely on the cowardice of politicians . " The train slowed down for its passage through the urban ruin of the South Bronx , and I explained that whereas the devil offered Faust knowledge and power in return for his soul , the modern corporations would offer traits and characteristics for a percentage of the gross and that , with any luck , the lawsuits would last a thousand years . The trace of an approving smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . but then he thought of the numberless charlatans unable to resist the temptation of promising biological utopia , probably not much different in its landscape of good behaviors than the one envisioned by the Republican signers of the Contract with America  --  Sunday school rows of obedient citizens , all of them blameless and most of them blond , none of them committing crimes , nobody telling lies . " I can hear the speeches , " he said . " No more racial hatred . No more citizens physically or intellectually challenged . An end to war and aggression , and literacy furnished at birth . Welcome to the New Jerusalem . " I assured him that even the Christian Coalition would come to its senses and everyone would remember that the end of war is also the end of finance capitalism , that by relieving the human race of its stupidity and grief , the apostles of everlasting happiness also would be evicting themselves from the office in Washington and the pulpit in Palm Springs . The young man frowned , still worried about the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although nobody could afford to put the proposition quite so plainly , a consensus of the country 's best and most respectable opinion would discover that an excess of virtue debases the currency of free will and subverts the meaning of the Constitution . The train was on the railroad bridge crossing the East River into Queens , and out the windows to the west we could see the triumphant Manhattan skyline glittering in the dusk . " Of what else is the city made , " I said , " except the sins of mankind ? " Without avarice , I said , what would become of Wall Street ? Deprive a broker of his inalienable right to insider trading , and the market would empty of both buyers and sellers . Without lust , what would happen to the news and entertainment media ? The few remaining journalists would be reduced to making lists of yesterday 's temperature readings . Without wrath , who would go to see Steven Seagal movies or the Super Bowl ? Without pride , what hairdresser would survive an afternoon 's appointments ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envy from the national genome , and the entire apparatus of the American economy-the glory of its markets and the grandeur of its laws , the whole magnificent edifice of steel and glass and neon light  --  would crumble as surely into dust as the colossal wreck of Troy . " It would never do , you see , " I said . " Human perfection is the ruin of the state . " In Pennsylvania Station a Salvation Army band was playing " Joy to the World . " The young man walked with me toward Seventh Avenue , both of us pushing against the current of the holiday crowd festooned with shopping bags from Tiffany 's and Bloomingdale 's and The Gap . But in all that vast throng of wayward souls , hurrying home to Christmas and the suburbs , bearing overpriced gifts and long lists of New Year 's promises they already knew they could n't keep , I noticed very few who did n't look to be angry or tired or late . Reminded of the vanity of human wishes and the heavy burden of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I clapped the student on the back and told him to take heart , rejoice in the spirit of the season , and know that he saw before him a lifetime guarantee of steady work . " Fear not , " I said . " Even if by some mischance Bristol-Myers Squibb isolates the gene for peace on earth and goodwill toward men , the poor could n't afford it and the rich would want something more amusing . " The young man almost smiled  --  not as yet a broad smile , not a smile that anybody would associate with Santa Claus or think to put on a Hallmark Card , but nonetheless a brighter expression than the one with which he had boarded the train in New Haven . In the distance I could hear the Salvation Army trumpet taking up the tune of " Good King Wenceslaus , " and as the divinity student walked off into the traffic and the rain changing to snow , I thought I noticed a stronger set to his shoulders , as if somehow it had occurred to him that toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of God . <p>
