When Jeffrey Andrew Russell needed to escape his mother , he hid in the old black Buick on the edge of the far pasture , where the woods began . The Buick had small dark windows and doors as heavy as coffin lids . Long ago , the family had ridden around in it , but before Jeffrey was seven someone had left it to sag into the soft Connecticut green . The Buick 's name was Vi , because its upholstery was gray-violet . His family named all their cars , the way some people name their boats , or their children . Except when he needed somewhere to hide , he avoided the Buick , in part because dreaded spiders had come to live in the glove compartment , but also because he had always thought of Vi as a sort of person and now she was dead , which made him feel sad and desirous of showing respect . <p> On the summer day the Green Man appeared to him for the first time , it was very hot in the car . In deference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , making himself small , breathing shallowly and softly , listening for the sound of his father 's car horn in the driveway , which would signal that it was safe to go back into the house . In a corner of the windshield , a spindly-legged yellow jacket mumbled to itself . Outside , the cicadas practiced their scales . The path through the pasture , which was overgrown with black raspberry and thistle , remained empty , but this was not to be trusted . He fought to stay awake and alert . <p> The heat was palpable . He began to nod and drowse , jerking upright at imagined sounds of movement , then drowsing and nodding again . Having drowsed once too often , he woke in a panic from a deep sizzling sleep to find Vi darkened with the slant of late day . Cautiously he opened the door , go out , and stood up directly under the gaze of a tall , broad-shouldered figure standing not ten feet away in the forest fringe . <p> His first panicked thought was , Mom ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother : it was a very dirty , very hairy bearded man . His hair was black , and it grew all over him : long and matted on his head , a tangle of beard hanging below the big nipples of his broad furry chest , his penis and testicles dangling pale between the dark-pelted columns of his legs . Late light spilling through the birches cast a green glow over his shoulders and belly . His eyes were holes of shadow . Jeffrey stared , not daring to twitch , but in the end he had to , and the instant he did , the green man was gone , without a rustle of brush . <p> Jeffrey blinked , moved forward into the forest fringe , and listened , the way he listened at the door of his bedroom for his mother 's footstep on the landing . " Hello ? " he said , in what his mother would have called a stage whisper . " I know you 're there . " He listened some more . The woods were like lungs breathing in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was afraid of the snakes which sunned themselves on the summer trails , and he had heard somewhere that there were old bear traps under the loam that could take your off a the ankle before you knew what was happening . He was still standing there , undecided , when he heard a car toot twice across the meadow . <p> He returned to the house with careful haste by the front door facing the street , which only he and the Jehovah 's Witnesses ever used . The mountain laure growing to one side was out of flower by now , its tiny white sticky maroon-banded grails of blossom withered and fallen to the sterile acid loam . From the foyer , he ascended the staircase which led to the landing separating his bedroom from his parents ' . He could hear the clatter of dishes from the kitchen which meant that his mother was preparing dinner . The clatter did not sound particularly quick or harsh ; he relaxed a bit . This meant she was not too angry at him for running away from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in Vietnam , as usual ; Jeffrey 's father , catching a few minutes of the early news before dinner . <p> Jeffrey went into his bedroom with the Star Trek models suspended by wires from the ceiling and lay on the blue corduroy cover of his bed . He thought of the green man and felt excited in a way he could not name . The man had felt wild to him , somehow , much wilder than the raccoons who thudded every night from the pine tree onto the roof . Jeffrey had seen a wild deer once . It had jumped into his father 's headlights when they were coming home from the movies in New Milford . His father had cursed and slammed on the brakes . The deer had just stood there , and then it had vanished , with no more sound than a goldfish makes in the goldfish bowl . But the green man had seemed wilder even than this . <p> When his father called him to come down for dinner , he descended to the kitchen by the second staircase on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting the finishing touches to a platter of cold roast beef and sliced tomatoes , her broad back turned to him . His father was not there . He felt a moment of panic . She had thick hair the color of field-mouse fur . She always claimed she had eyes in the back of her head , and once again she demonstrated the reasonableness of this : the moment he entered the room she said in a quick rich quiet voice , " Honey , Mama was just funning ; she would never hurt you , you know that . " She did not pause in her work and she did not turn to look at him . He took his seat at the kitchen table , thinking of the green man 's invisible eyes . <p> At dinner under the kitchen fan , Jeffrey 's father announced his intention to go on a lecture tour . " Scott thinks it 's the ideal way to promote the new book , " he said . Scott was their agent in New York . Jeffrey 's father wore a gray beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so fat he had no waist , only a belt across the middle of his bulge , like Humpty-Dumpty . He mopped his brow with his napkin every few minutes . <p> " That 's a marvelous idea , " said Jeffrey 's mother . Her yellow shift clung to her in the heat , showing the outline of her big breasts and her slender waist . She put a slice of cold roast beef on Jeffrey 's plate , next to his salad . " There you are , love , " she said , smiling at him , as though nothing whatever had happened . <p> " Thank you , " Jeffrey said . <p> " Thank you whom ? " growled his mother , doing her Captain Hook face . <p> " Thank you , Mom . " <p> " That 's better . Give Mama a kiss , " she said . She pursed her lips . He screwed up his face and sacrificed it to her . She took his chin in her hand and mashed her mouth against his . She smelled like tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a satisfied smack of her lips . " Umm , gum , " she said . Dropping his gaze to his plate , he noted with alarm the Italian salad dressing running into his meat . " When would you be leaving ? " his mother said to his father . <p> " Around January first , " said Jeffrey 's father , forking roast beef . <p> " Can I come with you ? " Jeffrey asked . <p> " May I come with you , " said his mother . <p> " May I come with you ? " Jeffrey asked . <p> His father scowled . " No , son . You 've got school . This meat is a little well done , Rae . " <p> " I 'm so sorry , " Jeffrey 's mother replied smoothly . She had been about to transfer a slice of beef from the platter to her plate . Inspecting it , she lifted it into the air and held it out to her husband instead . " Here , Simon . This is as rare as can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are you going to have ? " <p> " Why , there 's enough here to feed the Russian army , " said Jeffrey 's mother . She took another piece of meat from the serving platter . <p> " For God 's sake , Rae , that 's an end piece . There 's no red in it at all . " <p> " It 's perfectly delicious , " said Jeffrey 's mother with finality . She cut a piece of dry brown meat , chewed it , then took a sip from her third glass of white Gallo . Jeffrey watched his father watch her wrap her big fingers around the glass , raise it , tilt it , suck up the pale liquid into her full , sensual mouth . <p> Jeffrey 's mother had been a radio actress in Hollywood in the Thirties , known for her dramatic voice . She had met Jeffrey 's father on the set of a show where he was one of the head writers . Hanging in the upstairs dressing room was a picture of her as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photograph , her hair was shoulder-length and gently waved . Her chin rested on white-gloved hands . Around her neck twined a choker of big round ceramic beads . She gazed straight out at the photographer , fearless and subtly challenging . Jeffrey thought it was the most beautiful picture he had ever seen . <p> They ate in silence for a while . Then his mother stood up and poured herself another glass of wine from the counter . Jeffrey drank some milk . His father said to him , " Do n't fill your belly up with milk . You have n't touched your salad . " Jeffrey searched his salad for something without much dressing on it . He settled on three cherry tomatoes . He ate them slowly , one at a time , clamping down on them hard with his teeth so they exploded into wet sweetness , like little bombs . Sitting again , his mother took a few more bites of meat , then put her fork and knife in " finished " position . She lit a Camel cigarette , blowing smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to eat ? " Jeffrey 's father asked her . <p> She looked over her men . Her eyes twinkled . " I am so full I could not pull a-no-ther blade of grass , baa , baa , " she replied . <p> Every day after that Jeffrey looked for the green man . Sometimes he thought he saw him out of the corners of his eyes , but when he turned , there was never anything there . When his father took him shopping in New Milford , the next big town over , Jeffrey scanned the clusters of hippies on the Green . His father said , " If they 'd bathe occasionally people would take them more seriously . " None of them looked like the green man . As trees flashed by on their homeward drive , groves of slim trunks misted green , Jeffrey searched their dappled depths for signs of dark thigh and hairy shoulder , but they were just trees . <p> One evening , remembering the stories his mother had told him about leaving food for the Little People , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the fridge and left them on the hood of the Buick . The next morning , the chicken leg was gone and the cup was overturned in the grass . Encouraged , he tried the experiment again , but abandoned it after he stole out one night with a flashlight and surprised a raccoon mother and her babies consuming the offerings . He stayed on the alert , and more than once spent the day in the far pasture , hoping that the green man would appear , but he did not . <p> One night Jeffrey 's parents had a big fight . It was a Friday . They went out to dinner and came home after Jeffrey was in bed . Jeffrey was glad when they went out to dinner , though he could not have explained why ; it made him feel safe , the way it made him feel safe on the rare occasions when he walked into the kitchen and found them standing by the sink kissing . Lying in bed , he thought about the green man while the old house creaked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1792 . There was a huge stone fireplace downstairs with a Dutch oven built into it , and there was an attic full of cobwebs and old steamer trunks . The driveway gravel had garnets in it ; you could pick them up like rubies and hold them to the light . The first spring after his parents had moved to the house , only white flowers had come up in the front gardens . His mother had pulled them all out because , she said , they reminded her of funerals . She had replaced them with color : slashing red tulips , like her lipstick ; foaming beds of yellow , purple , blue , wine , rose , and brown irises ; geysers of pink phlox which she complained always ran to magenta after a few years . <p> When he was very little she had given him a little bed of his own to plant , out near the well-house off the driveway . He had liked pansies , with their foolish gold and black faces ; bachelor 's buttons , particularly the dark reddish-purple kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late afternoon and always amazed him because they had flowers of different colors on the same bush . His mother said to him , " You have a green thumb . " She always took care of the flowers but gave him the credit . When he got older , he helped her weed among the corn and tomatoes . She told him wonderful stories , about Wol the owl and Eeyore the donkey and a green garter snake that had visited her one summer in the garden they had had before they had moved to this place , when he was still in the baby carriage . " He came right up and sat in my lap , " she told him . " He would go away when the sun went down and be back the next day . " After a while he got tired of gardening and she eventually stopped asking him to help her . <p> He fell asleep and was awakened by the car crunching on the driveway . Doors opened and slammed shut . He heard raised voices , his mother 's loud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long while passed before the voices stopped , then another long while during which he heard his father 's heavy ascension of the stairs , his bathroom garglings and flushings , and finally silence . He lay in the dark , alert . His chest and stomach felt heavy . <p> He thought , quite suddenly , of a day when he was four and his parents had taken him down to the lake with some of their grown-up city friends . There were water-lilies in the lake , which was very shallow , and perch , and a dam at one end which the water slid over in slow glassy sheets every spring thaw . That day the dam had been dry . The visitors had stood on the concrete in their New York clothes , chatting and puffing on cigarettes , admiring the scenery . Forgotten , Jeffrey had squatted at the edge of the dam and looked out over the water . He had been able to see his reflection in the surface of the lake , darkened and ripply ; then , as his eyes had adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had found he could look through his reflection and see the bottom of the lakebed . <p> Up on the dam the air was full of chattering voices and an odd tension . Down in the water it was still and calm , lake-weed hanging immobile , each pebble distinct . A yearning had swept over him , a yearning to be part of that tranquility , to sink down deep into it ; he had found himself falling forward toward his reflection . His father had caught him and pulled him back with an oath of concern . They had made much of his near-mishap , which had pleased him . But now , lying in the dark , he remembered the stillness at the bottom of the lake and longed for it again . <p> He had just begun to doze off for a second time when he heard his bedroom door opening . Yellow hallway light jabbed his eyes . He smelled his mother 's cigarette and her Blue Grass cologne . He closed his eyes and lay still , his heart pounding . The cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed . " Baby , " she said . She touched his hair . He thought of the lake and sank down , down . <p> The next morning , his parents would only talk to one another in monosyllables , and his father took the car into New Milford to have breakfast there . Jeffrey sat at the big kitchen table with his mother . Her cigarette burned in an ashtray . She looked tired , and drank several cups of fragrant black coffee while he ate the buttered waffles she had made him . " Are they good , baby ? " she asked him . He nodded . After a silence , she took a drag on her Camel and added , " Your father 's being a bastard . " When he glanced up at her face , she blew smoke , blinked rapidly and smiled . " Well , enough of that nonsense . " She patted his small hand with her big ugly one . " You 're my precious baby . Finish your breakfast ; Mama 's got chores to do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , and started sweeping the floor . By the time he had eaten the last of his waffle and deposited his dishes in the sink , she was on her hands and knees scrubbing the linoleum with a brush . He went upstairs to his room , got out the Science Officer tunic his mother had made for him and the Spock ears his father had bought for him , put them on , grabbed a phaser , and went downstairs again . His mother was still scrubbing the kitchen floor . Her cigarette was in her mouth . He left the house by the mountain laurel door and made for the vegetable garden . <p> The garden was south of the far pasture where he had hidden in the Buick and seen the green man for the first time . His mother had had one of the young neighbor farmers till up the ground for her , and she had planted tomatoes , potatoes , carrots , squash , beans , sweet peppers , cucumbers for pickles , dill for pickles ( she made them herself in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishwasher ) , glads , which he thought really looked glad with their bright colors , and sweet corn . He crawled through the sweet corn , trying to circle around the party of Klingons who had devastated the Federation outpost . The soft manured earth gave under his knees and hands , rich as chocolate cake . Though the day was already sweltering the ground was still wet under the corn . <p> The Klingons were proving difficult to evade . They had spread out in a wide scan of the area , searching for him . Jeffrey changed direction and headed at top speed toward the old asparagus patch , which marked the eastern edge of the tilled ground . Beyond it lay meadow , then a near arm of the same woods which bordered the far pasture a quarter mile away . Jeffrey reasoned that if he could make it to the meadow , he would be out of the Klingons ' phaser range , and the Enterprise could beam him up before the Klingons knew what was happening . In the heat , his Spock ears felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved before him . He broke from the garden and made a dash for the cover of a clump of black raspberry . <p> The green man was standing in the meadow halfway between the forest edge and Jeffrey 's raspberry clump . He looked exactly as Jeffrey remembered him : naked as night , hairy , powerful . He raised his left arm , muscle-bunched , in greeting palm held flat and upright . For a moment Jeffrey thought he was going to open the two middle fingers , the way Mr. Spook did . Then the green man dropped his arm and began moving slowly toward the woods . At the fringe , he stopped and looked over his hairy shoulder at Jeffrey , waiting smiling a white smile like the Pepsodent man , though Jeffrey knew the green man probably did not brush regularly after every meal . The smile hit Jeffrey like a baseball in the face , but in a good way . It was a smile for him alone , like Mr. Halloran 's smile at school when he got an " E " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something , the green man had turned again and melted into the trees . <p> This time Jeffrey ran right up to the woods and a few steps in . " Come back , " he said . He took a few more steps . Sweet green sunlight dappled his Science Officer tunic . It was cool in the shade . He looked carefully around and could see no tracks the green man might have left . " Hello ? " he said again , raising his voice . Some birds thrashed and dropped and rose , chittering . In the distance , tree-trunks leaned , half-fallen , in heavy slants . There was moss on them . He took another few steps forward . No trap snapped around his ankle , but the green man did not reappear . <p> At breakfast a week later , when his parents were eating at the same table again but still not talking much , Jeffrey said to his father 's newspaper , " I saw a man in the woods . " <p> " Christ almighty ! " his father exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yolk down his rotund plaid front . " I ca n't wear a clean shirt for five minutes ! " <p> " Oh , Simon ; it 's nothing . " Jeffrey 's mother put down her coffee cup , stood up , went to the counter , picked up a washcloth , rinsed it under the tap , walked back to the table , and began wiping off her husband . Impatiently he took the cloth from her and wiped himself . She said , " Jeffrey Andrew Russell , did you go into those woods by yourself ? " <p> " No , Mama . I just went to the edge . " <p> " Jeffrey ? " She turned her all-knowing undeceivable gaze upon him . " Are you sure you 're not fibbing to Mama ? " <p> " That 's all I did , Mama . I just saw him on the edge . " He shut his mouth . He had almost added , Of the far pasture . <p> His father put the washcloth aside . " Did he have a gun ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times that hunters were always creeping on to the property and shooting animals illegally , another reason why he was forbidden to go into the woods alone , because hunters could think you were a deer and shoot you before they knew you were a boy . <p> " What did he look like ? " <p> " Simon , " said Jeffrey 's mother , " you do n't have to grill him that way . " <p> " Will you please let me talk to the boy ? " <p> " The boy ? " Her tone was amused . Jeffrey shrank . " I believe your son has a name . " She lit a cigarette and blew smoke elaborately . Jeffrey 's father turned red . <p> " I am simply endeavoring to determine the facts of the matter , Rae , " he snapped . <p> Jeffrey 's mother shook her head and smiled to herself . To Jeffrey she said , " What did the man look like , darling ? " <p> " Like one of those hippies on the Green in New Milford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any clothes on . " His parents stiffened in unison and exchanged meaningful looks . <p> His father said to his mother over his head , " Those damn kids . I 'd better call Harley Marsden . " Harley Marsden was the town constable . <p> " Oh , Simon , they do n't mean any harm . " <p> Jeffrey 's father pushed his chair back violently . Jeffrey shut his eyes . He heard the swinging door from the kitchen to the foyer open and shut ; heavy steps ; the telephone being dialed . His mother said to him , " I never want you going near those woods again . Not without Mama . Do you understand , Jeffrey ? " <p> " Yes . " He heard his father 's grim voice talking into the receiver , but he could not hear the words clearly . <p> " Yes , whom ? " <p> " Yes , Mother . " He opened his eyes again and gave her a reassuring look . He was shocked to see tears on her cheeks . She looked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette . Guilt doused him like cold rain water off a fir branch . " I 'm sorry , Mama . I wo n't do it again . " <p> " Of course you wo n't , darling , " she said . She gave him a brave smile and patted his arm . " Mama loves you , that 's all . She loves you more than tongue can tell . She would n't want anything to happen to her precious Jeffie . " <p> " He did n't do anything , " Jeffrey whispered . She shushed him and stroked his arm , then his hair . His father shoved through the swinging door . <p> " Harley said he 'd bring Rob over to look around , " said Mr. Russell . " Those damn kids ! I spend a fortune on ' No Trespassing ' signs and I might as well be putting out a welcome mat . " To Jeffrey he said , " When did this happen ? " <p> " Last Saturday , " Jeffrey said . His mother stood silently and turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear any shots from the woods that afternoon ? " <p> " No . " Clink went the dishes . <p> " Did he do anything or say anything to you ? " <p> " No . " Suddenly , he was afraid , not for himself , but for the green man . <p> " Do you think you could show Mr. Marsden where you saw the man ? " <p> " Yes , " he said . Later that day Harley and Rob , his beefy blond deputy , arrived . Jeffrey led them and his father to the far pasture where Vi was . Forbidden to accompany them , he watched the three tramp off into the woods , like two bowling pins taking a bowling ball on a hike . They came back in three hours , Jeffrey 's father puffing and the two policemen shaking their heads . They had found the dead remains of a campfire and something else , something odd in a tree which they would not talk about in front of Jeffrey . <p> His mother put him to bed early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookies , which she had spent all day making , sheet after sheet of them , perfect and gleaming and fragrant . He lay upstairs in his bedroom , trying to translate the adult drones from the kitchen into language . He thought , He 'll never come back now . I 'll never see him again . He felt a great desolation . <p> Nothing happened for many days . School came , a new grade with all his old friends . He almost forgot the green man in his joy over the crackly and perfumed new books and the wonderful stacks of empty lined writing paper . He got E 's in Spelling and Arithmetic and Reading , and he had a part in the Thanksgiving pageant , a pilgrim with a big round white cardboard collar . Hard frost killed all the flowers in the garden . Men came with a truck to fill the oil-burning furnace in the cellar . One night he woke up while it was still dark and saw snow drifting down like feathers through the porch light . <p> He got out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . He had on his slip-slops , but his feet were still cold . At first he could only think of Christmas : snow meant Christmas was coming . He loved Christmas . He watched as the snow buried the back yard , the swing set , his mother 's dead roses , the dark eaves of the Little House where his father 's forbidden study was . He thought of the cow and the horse asleep in the barn . The cow slept lying down , but the horse slept standing up . His mother had told him that . He thought of snow falling over the silent woods . He wondered if the green man was still out there , somewhere . He must have gone back to his commune , he thought . But what if he did n't ! What if he did n't have a commune to go back to ! <p> He felt a pang like the pang he felt when his mother looked sad and lonely . He got back into bed and pulled the quilt up to his neck . He fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot dry green cornstalks while his mother shouted to him from the kitchen door to come back , come back , come back . The next morning was Saturday . He rose early to smothered blank brightness . He got dressed and went downstairs to the kitchen . His mother was at the counter with her red and green Christmas apron on , Fanny , Farmer Cookbook open , peering down her bifocals with flour and sugar in sacks around her . He said to her , " May I go out and play ? " <p> " Do n't I get a kiss first ? " He went over to her and let her mash him again . Her lips tasted like vanilla extract . She smiled at him , her world , her joy , her own . " You put on your boots and your hood , " she commanded him . " And your snow-pants . " <p> " Yes , Mama , " he said . <p> " And your gloves . " <p> " I will . " He smiled back at her and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall he sat on the bottom of the stairs near the telephone stand and pulled on his red snow-pants , then his red rubber boots . They were hard to get on , but he did it . From the long coat-rack he took down his stuffed coat with the hood . He put it on and buttoned it up . He waddled back into the kitchen . His mother turned hurriedly from the spice cupboard to the sink and opened the tap . He watched her wash out a glass and put it on the drainboard . She turned smiling to him . " You look as snug as a bug in a rug , " she said . " Are you going to make snow angels ? " <p> " Yes , " he said . After a moment he said , " Bye , " and went outside into the snow . <p> It was a completely different world at once . The morning sun was bright and the morning sky was cloudless blue . The back yard stretched away , a flat unbroken expanse of dazzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow-covered lawn , leaving tracks with his red boots . He climbed the slick ladder of the jungle gym , paused at the top to wave at his mother , who was watching him through the kitchen door , then shot down the slide on his rump . He landed in a heap of snow and laughed . The metal of the slide gleamed clean behind him . He stood up , batted at his snow-pants with his gloves ; snow powdered the air and went up his nose . He slid down the slide three more times , then wandered on through the yard , taking his time lest she be watching still , past his father 's Little House , until he came to the lilac hedge with its hard brown sleeping buds . He walked through the opening in the hedge and out of sight of the kitchen door . <p> He began to run . It was awkward , in his leggings and boots ; he slid a little and fell down once . There was no snow under the pine trees at the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch his breath . His father was already hard at work , typing . Smoke trickled from the Little House chimney . Jeffrey looked up at the brown-lit windows . Inside , he knew , there were walls and walls of books , and silence like the calm at the bottom of the lake . He hurried on . <p> He passed the cow barn and the horse stall and the ghostly rhubarb patch . He passed the corral , which in spring and summer was calf-deep manure . Even now , in places , the snow had melted into hoof-prints . On the far side of the corral , a low fieldstone wall marked the edge of the far pasture , but he did not head that way . He walked to the edge of what had been the vegetable garden . Snow had softened its hard lumps and ridges . Here and there grasses raised white plumes into the cold air , their undersides pale brown . There were no more cornstalks ; his mother had them tilled under every fall . He stepped forward into the frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were bees in his hair . This is where the tomatoes were , he thought . This is where the potatoes were .

He picked one of the asparagus berries and put it in his mouth . It tasted bitter , so he spit it out . <p> He crossed the asparagus trench and entered the meadow . The white trees of the woods lay waiting for him on the other side . The Klingons did not fire upon him . He passed the snowy hump of a black raspberry bush , and another . When he was close enough to see the green man 's eyes , he stopped . <p> They were dark and fierce and full of love . They made him want to chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . The man was holding out his furred hand . Jeffrey thought of his mother 's smell of tobacco and wine in the dark , of her mouth mashing his , of her precise knife-cuts at the kitchen counter . He thought of his fat father asking , " What are you going to have , Rae ? " at the kitchen table , as though it was food she needed . He thought of Vi rotting in silence while wasps knocked themselves stupid against the windshield . He looked into the green man 's eyes and said , " Could you please show me where the raccoons go when they go away and you do n't see them ? " The man nodded , very seriously . Jeffrey reached up and took his hand , and together the two of them turned and walked into the forest . <p> <p> By Rand B. Lee <p> Rand B.
