For mountain climbers the news over Memorial Day weekend was grim but not really surprising . At Yosemite Valley in California , the body of Derek Hersey , a renowned Alpinist whose unforgiving specialty was rock-wall climbing done solo and without the protection of belays , was found below Sentinel Peak . And on Alaska 's Denali ( Mount McKinley ) , descending unroped in darkness down an icy chute called Orient Express , Charles Cearley , 40 , a mountaineer from Seattle , fell 3,000 ft. and died . <P> The one-paragraph stories that appeared in most of the nation 's press did n't tell much . As usual , Hersey , 36 , an Englishman who lived in Boulder , Colorado , had been climbing alone . No one knows what went wrong , at what height , on a route that should have been relatively easy for him . It was a private death , leaving too few scraps to make a puzzle . Cearley 's fall seems easier to understand . He and two companions had made the arduous climb to the 20,320-ft. summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest and rope up , Cearley , who was not using his ice ax , lost his balance and slid away . <P> Other climbers read such details and shrug . Mistake or mischance , there is nothing useful to say . This is not because the deaths are meaningless but because their meaning seems alarmingly personal . They raise the sort of dust that stirs in every mountaineer 's sheaf of recollections : soft snow breaks out from under your boots on a steep slope . You slide , gaining speed . Then some mountain god flips a coin , and it comes up heads . You stop sliding , safe as a baby , a few yards above a long drop . Nothing to say . <P> Another event of two weekends ago , however , the opening of Sylvester Stallone 's ridiculous rock-jock thriller Cliffhanger , left lots to say . For one thing , the movie is set in Colorado but was filmed in Italy . The towering white needles of the Dolomites do n't look anything like the massive peaks of the Rockies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What really irks is that all the heroics , the nifty pendulum swings and the human-fly action below the 40-ft. overhangs , are sure to bring more flatlanders into the mountains . <P> The sorry truth is that too many climbers are there already , at least on the big-name peaks . At the time Cearley fell to his death on Denali , 489 other climbers were somewhere on the famous mountain , America 's highest . During the week just before , 147 had reached the summit . " Believe it or not , sometimes it can get kind of crowded up there , " says Denali park ranger Kathy Sullivan . <P> Crowds are worse on Colorado 's 14,255-ft . Longs Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park . Last year some 29,000 hikers reached the top , a rise of 53% since 1990 . This is a nose-to-tail wilderness experience . Permits are assigned by lottery to climb Mount Whitney , above California 's Owens Valley , at 14,494 ft. , the highest summit in the Lower 48 states . The limit is 50 people a day in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of April all the slots were assigned .
