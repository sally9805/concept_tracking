<p> The beauty or the tragedy of Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris , depending on the point of view , is that he does n't play the game . <p> He 's a politician of wit and pith , yet sometimes it 's almost as if he is n't there . He keeps his distance from the media like prey from predator , fearing he 'll be baited or his meaning will be mangled . <p> Voters re-elected him in 1994 with a 64 percent majority , yet his way of exercising authority is odd for one with such a mandate . Though he nominally governs the City Council , he leaves much of the power-brokering to colleagues who are more social , more ambitious or more aggressive . If the debate gets out of hand in a sweaty meeting room at midnight , he 'll defuse tension and restore sense with a brainy speech . And that , he says , is a noble and unsung job . <p> " ( Former Mayor ) Lionel Wilson going into a City Council meeting would make sure he had votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business person who has been involved in local politics for 30 years . " Elihu does n't do that . He does n't talk to the council members . . . . He has as much influence as everyone else , and this is of his own choosing . " <p> Under the City Charter , Oakland 's mayor is n't the city 's chief executive  --  that 's the city manager 's job . The mayor promotes economic development , submits an annual budget and provides community leadership . <p> In short , the mayor is chief of rhetoric and of persuasion . In Harris ' case , the rhetoric  --  illustrated by his budgets , his youth , crime and economic policies , and his appointments to the port and planning commissions  --  often has been as impressive as his ability to move the city has been disappointing . Margaret Cunningham , a field representative for Service Employees International Union Local 790 , admires Harris ' intellect and his ability to connect with others . <p> " I 've seen evidence of real affection for him and his affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But ) I really think in many ways he 's not suited to be a politician . . . . The consensus around town has been that he 's been really low-profile , especially his second term . " <p> Harris holds himself to high standards of performance . Constituents expect that as mayor , he ought to enforce these standards throughout City Hall . Yet Harris says that 's one of the saddest misconceptions Oakland citizens have about their government . <p> One observation he never tires of making is that under Oakland 's weak-mayor format , he has but a shred of constitutional power . Unelected administrators run the show , it 's their right to do so without political interference , and their shortcomings are not his direct responsibility . <p> Even if those shortcomings produce a piece of work such as the Raiders deal , with its public risk for stadium cost overruns and faulty economic assumptions . He saw it less as a matter of politics than of business between the then- independent Coliseum board and a stadium tenant . <p> Since Harris took office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue or vice . But there 's another way to look at it . Harris , though he 's a liberal Democrat , has conservative personal values and he 's militantly protective of them . <p> He does n't play the meat market of district-elected council members trying to get this or that deal for their end of town . That 's not his job  --  same as bossing managers who are their own bosses is n't wise mayoral conduct . <p> Another market he abhors is the stock market . He played it . Once . <p> He bought Apple Computer on a broker 's recommendation . He promptly lost half the value of the investment , as Apple reported heavy losses . He fired the broker and has n't talked to him since . <p> Harris likes a sure thing and a partner like his old Sacramento crony , Willie Brown . The pair bought an Oakland radio station , KDIA , in 1992 . They sold it two years later . <p> After taxes , Harris nearly tripled his $ 170,000 investment . <p> Former Assemblyman Harris did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Having practiced his trade within Assembly committees of lawyerly peers who had long enjoyed power in the state capital , Harris came to town and carried on as if his mental powers would win the day . <p> When he was rewarded with jabs instead , he felt misunderstood . He felt wounded . <p> " He 's spoiled in that regard , " says an ally . " He wants opposition to be based on reasoned principle . " <p> Harris says : " I 've attempted not to be superficial . " <p> Harris has left his mark on Oakland . One of his first projects was to devise City Council committees to generate expertise  --  and power  --  for the electoral side of government . Thus , the power balance tilted from the unelected administration , and council members are on the verge of hiring a manager who 'll run the city on their terms . <p> The public demanded a safer city and more police accountability , and Harris responded with a 15- point crime plan that steered city officials toward his vision of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the city has become cleaner , safer and more prosperous . It 's the economy , true , but credit as well Harris ' role in recruiting retailers such as Sears , employers such as Federal Express , investors such as Walter Shorenstein and regional attractions such as Cirque du Soleil . He 's helped retain industries such as Broadway 's Auto Row . His appointments to the Planning Commission have sent a message to shlock developers . <p> One of Harris ' proudest creations is Bay Trade , an alliance of local governments to promote Pacific Rim trade . He travels often to meet Oakland port shippers and potential developers in Asia . <p> " Mayor Harris likes to do things low-key , but very effective , " says Oakland port commissioner John Loh . " He is building ' guanxi '  --  the relationship  --  that is necessary . So that when we make promises , they know the mayor is behind us . " <p> The mayor has set for himself the ambitious goal of getting the federal government to dredge the port yet again within three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to compete for trans-Pacific shippers with their super-size vessels that would scrape bottom in shallow channels . <p> Harris , who turns 50 in August , recently knocked down a rumor that he was quitting midterm to take a job in the Clinton administration . The rumor had potency because of Harris ' incredible shrinking profile . <p> Harris ' frustration with the goings-on at City Hall , says a friend , began at the end of his first term and accelerated last year when he lost a campaign to change Oakland 's form of government . But if he seems tired of the job , he 's more patient and more buoyant in his demeanor . With his Far East project , he 's waxing statesmanlike . He 's modeling , perhaps , for a run to be the successor to Representative Ron Dellums , D-Oakland , though Dellums is n't expected to give up his job any day soon . Or he might like to go into business . <p> Meanwhile , while others may gamble , there 's the predictable income from those muni bonds . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes and shops to Old Oakland , Sears to the vacant Emporium-Capwell , the University of California president 's office to a vacant lot on Broadway , developer Walter Shorenstein to City Center . But deals do n't make a vision . And though downtown looking better , it 's still on government life-support . B- <p> . <p> PORT &; INTERNATIONAL TRADE <p> Formed Bay Trade to promote Pacific Rim business , helped bring about deal to dredge port , traveled to Far East to secure port business . His best work . A <p> . <p> COMMUNITY POLICING <p> Helped develop new community standards for police performance and accountability . But would higher-profile leadership have quickened the process ? B <p> . <p> GOV . &; FISCAL MANAGEMENT <p> Challenged city manager 's lock on information , appointed community leaders to city boards , voted against questionable downtown ice rink project but reserved in his opposition , vowed to hold line on city 's bond debt  --  but deals to keep three pro sports teams piled up public borrowing . B- <p> . <p> YOUTH <p> Created Camp Read-A-Lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public housing , proposed youth curfew but failed to mobilize community support . B <p> . <p> POLITICAL SKILL <p> Strange case of an astute government hand who concedes authority to others . Realpolitik , or just being wimpy ? Abundant gray matter and moral vision , little muscle . C <p> . <p> LEADERSHIP <p> Dynamic and generous one-on-one and in a small group , but lacks perseverance in communicating his vision and getting what he wants in guerrilla battles , such as last year 's strong-mayor initiative . Fatalism is his flaw . C-@48916 <p> For decades , San Jose was a city on the hustle  --  expanding as rapidly as it could , always eager to prove itself . <p> Under the stewardship of Mayor Susan Hammer the past 6 1/2 years , San Jose has developed a new , quiet effectiveness . <p> It has become the City That Works . <p> Handed some opportunities  --  and some genuine challenges  --  Hammer has known what to do . With quiet confidence and a vision that springs from pragmatism , she has set clear , detailed priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her critics say she has been little more than a caretaker , feeding off the momentum created by her predecessor , Tom McEnery , who is widely credited with transforming San Jose into a modern big city and with reviving the downtown neighborhood . <p> Hammer , they say , has lacked any larger vision . <p> But that overlooks the fiscal difficulties she has faced for most of the time she has been in office  --  revenue shortfalls that required more than $ 123 million in cuts from the city budget . <p> " The main thing she has done is get the city through six years of fiscal difficulties without huge pain , " said Terry Christensen , chairman of San Jose State University 's Political Science Department and a longtime observer of city politics . " That 's a major thing . <p> " She 's a very practical , down- to-earth , let's-get-it-done politician . But the rhetoric might have gotten a little more high-flying if there had been more money , " Christensen said . <p> Pick a problem facing San Jose  --  urban sprawl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth , crime , youth , the arts  --  and Hammer has addressed it . <p> Despite the budget cutbacks , she has set money aside every year  --  more than $ 25 million total  --  for special projects for young people and for stemming gang activity in San Jose . <p> The money , which has included an innovative program of direct grants to neighborhood organizations , has gone for everything from library homework centers , to laptop computers for cops , to tattoo removal for youths who want to leave gang life . <p> There are more police on the street than when she took over , and crime is down  --  although juvenile crime has dropped only in the past year . <p> San Jose has cemented its claim as the heart of Silicon Valley , attracting into the city major facilities or headquarters by Adobe Systems , Cisco Systems , Cadence Design Systems , Netcom and major American operations by Fujitsu and Sony . <p> The number of jobs in the city has risen more than 14 percent from 1991 through April of this year  --  before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its major new campus downtown . <p> Hammer was directly involved in wooing Adobe to town and initiating a series of reforms within city government that cut red tape and made the city more business-friendly . <p> The downtown turnaround begun by McEnery has blossomed under Hammer . <p> The Tech Museum of Innovation was opened during her tenure , the San Jose Museum of Art emerged as the western partner of the esteemed Whitney Museum of New York City , and Hammer is directly responsible for the building of the San Jose Repertory Theater in downtown . <p> Hammer presided over the 1993 opening of the city 's sports arena . Begun under McEnery , the arena has become a focal point for the city under Hammer , attracting sports and entertainment events of national prominence . <p> Not coincidentally , downtown nightlife has been booming . <p> She also took a major step in the city 's evolution away from the land-grabbing growth that characterized San Jose in the 1950s and 1960s . <p> She drew a " greenline " around the city that designates the periphery as off-limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hiring of Police Chief Lou Cobarruviaz and City Manager Regina Williams  --  the first Latino to head the city 's police force and the first African American to hold the city 's chief administrative post . <p> She also established a diversity program aimed at bringing more minorities into City Hall . <p> " She has done a lot to bring the city together , " said Mike Fox Sr. , one of the city 's leading business figures . <p> " Compared to most other big cities , San Jose 's ethnic diversity is being adjusted to very calmly and peacefully , " said Christensen . <p> Within the city 's inner circle , Hammer also has proven to be an adept and shrewd leader of the City Council , whose 11 members include the mayor . <p> Hammer 's ability to dominate the budget and the council 's committee system  --  where issues can be killed before they become problems  --  has meant that she has rarely lost a key vote . <p> " From a purely political point of view , her ability to put together six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest , qualities , " said political consultant Ed McGovern , one-time chief of staff to former San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos . <p> In fact , there are only a few instances where Hammer has failed to accurately assess the political atmosphere . <p> The most notable example is the 1992 defeat by voters of a Hammer-backed proposal to build a stadium in San Jose for the San Francisco Giants . The defeat appears to have had no residual effect on 59- year-old Hammer 's popularity or political maneuverability . <p> The only other major political sand trap has been the push by Hammer for approval of the 40-table Bay 101 card casino . <p> The club , opened in 1994 , generates $ 8.5 million in tax revenues annually . However , Hammer 's critics  --  led by Council members David Pandori and Pat Dando  --  have been steady opponents of Bay 101 , which they say is a spawning ground for crime . <p> But after nearly seven years  --  term limits will force Hammer out of office at the end of 1998  --  her shortcomings have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's opponents seem able to say of her is that she stayed the course . <p> SUSAN HAMMER <p> . <p> CRIME <p> There are more police on the streets than when Hammer took office . She was the first to openly confront the city 's growing problem with youth gangs , set a teenage curfew and has spent more discretionary money on youth and anti-gang activities than any other area of the budget . A <p> . <p> BUDGET MANAGEMENT <p> Steered the city through five years of tough budget cuts totaling more than $ 123 million . But at the same time , city services were considered to have held steady , and she found wiggle room in the budget to devote discretionary funds to making the city 's youth a priority . A <p> . <p> ECONOMIC GROWTH <p> The number of jobs in the city has jumped more than 14 percent since Hammer took office in 1991 . The economy is robust , key high-tech companies have been lured to the city and San Jose is starting to live up to its claim as the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A <p> . <p> DOWNTOWN <p> Opened the San Jose Sports Arena and the Tech Museum of Innovation and spearheaded the building of the San Jose Repertory Theater , a cornerstone of her efforts in the arts . Much was set in motion by her predecessor , but Hammer stayed the course and added her own touches . B <p> . <p> SPRAWL <p> Took the next step in the city 's steady shift away from the urban sprawl of the 1950s and ' 60s , drawing a " greenline " around the city and declaring that development in open spaces outside that line would be prohibited . Has struck what observers call a reasonable balance between development and the need for housing . B <p> . <p> POLITICAL SKILL <p> Shrewd and effective behind the scenes . Has lost very few issues before the City Council , knows how to use the power of the budget and City Council committee appointments to maintain a solid majority that often surpasses the two-thirds threshold . A <p> . <p> LEADERSHIP <p> Has done more for race relations than any mayor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's youth . Initiated a program of cutting red tape and making City Hall more citizen-friendly . Has lacked for inspiring rhetorical flourishes , but San Jose is n't that kind of city . B+
