March is a great time to watch Jupiter . As the month opens , the giant planet is conveniently placed in the evening sky and as close to Earth as it gets this year . Through a telescope , it presents the largest and most rewarding disk that we can see on any planet . What can you expect to see ? If you have a 2.4-to 3-inch telescope , you 'll easily see Jupiter 's slightly flattened disk streaked by an equatorial band or two . Do n't bother with high magnification  --  50x to 100x is all you need . However , the greater resolving and light-gathering power of a 6-or 8-inch telescope will allow you to use 150x to 200x and pick out some of the smaller and ever changing cloud features . No matter what the telescope , when you examine Jupiter , the first features to strike the eye are the planet 's dark belts ( banded regions of low pressure ) and bright zones ( regions of high pressure ) . These stretch parallel to the equator . The dark belts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jupiter 's disk is divided into numerous bands and zones , not all of which are visible at any one time . Currently , the visible belts include the North Equatorial Belt ( NEB ) , the South Equatorial Belt ( SEB ) , the North Temperate Belt ( NTB ) and , close to the south pole , the South South Temperate Belt ( SSTB ) . You can sometimes glimpse the famous Great Red Spot embedded in the southern edge of the South Equatorial Belt . But depending on which side of the planet is facing Earth at the time you are looking , you may or may not see the Spot . Even when it is visible , the Spot can be difficult to pick out because it is now rather pale . Overall , Jupiter 's cloud bands are relatively quiet now compared to 1989 and 1991 when they under went striking changes . Indeed , in July 1989 , the decade of prominence . Also , as if to make up for the loss of the SEB , the Red Spot darkened during the SEB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during most or 1990 . The SEB redeveloped in late 1990 and early 1991 and returned the face of Jupiter to its current " normal " appearance . TIPS FOR SEEING DETAIL Although Jupiter 's generous size and relatively well-defined belts and zones make it a rewarding target for any telescope , the type of telescope traditionally preferred by planetary observers is any well-collimated telescope with little or no central obstruction . And although 4-and 6-inch apertures can be used effectively by capable observers , a good choice for seeing lots of detail on Jupiter is probably an 8-inch aperture telescope . Because they have no obstructions in their light paths , refractors are highly regarded . A second choice would be a reflector whose secondary mirror can be made as small as possible . This keeps diffraction low and avoids undermining the already subtle contrast of Jupiter 's features . For the money , what 's ideal is an 8-inch f/7 reflector with a well-figured mirror and a small diagonal whose major axis is less than 15 percent of the primary mirror 's diameter . A selection of filters will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lighten discretely colored clouds and improve the contract between the belts and the zones . Filters I recommend for Jupiter 's clouds are the Wratten #82A ( very light blue ) , #38A ( light blue ) , #25 ( red ) , #12 ( yellow ) , and #58 ( green ) . The #82A , #12 , and #58 filters will increase the contrast between the bright and dark features , while the #38A and #25 will help you distinguish between reddish and bluish clouds that are almost always present . For observing Jupiter , or any planet for that matter , I prefer to use high-quality orthoscopic or Plossl eyepieces . Because Jupiter presents so large a disk , high powers are not necessary . Experienced observers agree that a power range of 150x to 250x is sufficient . RED SPOTS AND WHITE SPOTS The best known of Jupiter 's long-lived cloud features is the Great Red Spot . Probably hundreds of years old , it may have first been seen by Giovanni Cassini in 1665 . Thanks to spacecraft such as Pioneer and Voyager , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-pressure bulge in the atmosphere . The Spot is a spinning mass of red clouds that takes six Earth days for one counter-clockwise turn . This month , the Red Spot 's center should lie near the Jovian longitude of 35 degrees in what is called the System II cloud bands . ( See " The Naming of Parts " above ) But the Red Spot can move east or west in longitude and may not be at 35deg . The motion of the Red Spot relative to the rest of the clouds is generally westward ( in the direction of increasing longitude ) but its motion can be erratic and unpredictable . To determine when the Red Spot is likely to be visible , turn to page 64 in the Sky Almanac section for a table of Red Spot transit times . After the Great Red Spot , the second longest-lived features now active on Jupiter are the three white oval spots known cryptically as BC , DE , and FA . They are now situated near a latitude of 30 ' south , roughly the location of the now-laded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stand out easily and are a challenge to see . These White Spots first appeared in 1939 as extended brightenings in the South Temperate Zone . By 1947 , however , they had the appearance of long shallow bays on the south edge of the South Temperate Belt . In the following 45 years , the bays have shrunk to ovals that today look like round white spots . In recent years the spots have been difficult to see because the faded South Temperate Belt is n't dark enough to set them off . But White Spots BC and DE became briefly visible in March 1991 when a short-lived South Tropical Zone disturbance developed near them . White Spot FA was also visible through most of 1991 because it appeared attached to the eastern end of a dark segment of the otherwise missing South Temperate Belt . White Spots BC and DE , about 8 degrees long , have remained at this length for the last five years . Spot FA has shrunk to about 5 degrees in length and it may shrink out of existence before this decade is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting features to look for near Jupiter 's Equatorial Zone ( EZ ) are the blue spots and associated festoons ( diagonal streaks ) . These lie along the southern edge of the North Equatorial Belt ( NEB ) at a latitude of 7deg North . In fact , under close inspection all the dark protuberances extending equator-ward from the southern edge of the NEB are bluish . Because they are , a #25 red filter will darken these features and make them stand out . The diagonal blue streaks are unique to the northern equatorial area of Jupiter and are all very similar . For example , all exhibit rotation periods are very close to System I 's rate . This means they remain nearly stationary at the longitudes they occupy ( they do n't move east or west relative to surrounding clouds ) . The blue features are also all long-lived . Usually 12 of the bluish festoons , more-or-less equally spaced around the planet , are visible at any one time . Infrared photography shows them to be thermal sources much warmer than their surroundings . This suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's atmosphere through which snowflakes and droplets of water vent upwards . COLORS , BY JOVE ! Once you 've bagged some of the long-lived cloud features try looking for color . Orange , brown , blue , and yellow hues , almost always present in Jupiter 's clouds , appear distinct only with the aid or 10-inch and 12-inch telescopes . In smaller scopes , the colors are subtler and visible only on nights when the image is steady . The dark belts are normally colored brown , orange-brown , blue , or lavender . The zones can vary from white to blue . A year ago the South Equatorial Belt looked orange-brown while the North Equatorial Belt changed from dark brown to a lavender-brown . The center of the Red Spot ellipse was pink . A temporary belt that developed at the latitude of the South Tropical Zone ( but that has now disappeared ) had a striking bluish color . Look for these colors with as large an aperture as you can . The blues and the lavenders will be the toughest to perceive . WATCHING THE JOVIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months and you 'll see changes . For example , a disturbance consisting of dark festoons , dull veils , and bright oval spots may develop in the South Tropical Zone . If it does , it will be noticeable because the dark material will contrast with the white of the Tropical Zone . Also , if the disturbance occurs , it will most likely appear at longitudes just ahead of or just behind the Great Red Spot . Elsewhere on Jupiter , short-lived white streaks , bright rifts , or white spots may appear in the North Equatorial Belt particularly at its interior . Along its northern edge watch for the growth of intense orangy brown dark spots . Be sure to watch the active South Equatorial Belt and the Equatorial Zone . The EZ 's southern half was dark and orange-colored in 1991 but could change coloration any time . Also look elsewhere for dark spots and brilliant white ovals that can develop without warning .

THE NAMING OF PARTS Jupiter watchers soon learn to navigate through the technical terms for the planet 's myriad features In the standardized scheme , Jupiter 's dark belts and bright zones alternate from the equator to the poles in this order : Equatorial zone , equatorial belt , tropical zone , temperate belt , temperate zone , and polar region . Belts and zones are further specified by the hemisphere in which they appear . Because Jupiter rotates faster at its equator than at latitudes closer to the poles , astronomers group these features into two separate rotation systems , called System I and System II . System I includes all of the Equatorial zone and the adjacent south edge of the North Equatorial Belt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of this region is 9h50m30s All other latitudes north and south of System I belong to System II and rotate at 9h55m40.6s .
