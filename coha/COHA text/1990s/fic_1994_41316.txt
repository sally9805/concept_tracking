There is fire in my heart . I do what I can . <p> I sleep deep sleep . I sit in my bedroom window , bare feet on the roof , and scratch dry sticks across the slate . In the two months I 've been living here , though , I 've spent most of my time playing board games with Mr. Arnette , my mother 's new husband . He seems to have an unending supply of them in his basement from when his kids lived at home . My mother is n't around very often She works at the makeup counter at Neiman Marcus , although she really has n't needed to since she and Mr. Arnette were married . Mr. Arnette retired a few years ago , at forty , when he sold the windshield safety-glass company he had started right out of high school for what my mother described as " a fancy sum , for something that still shatters . " It was right after that that she met and married him . But she works anyway , only now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; more importantly , Monday night , the night my mother pretends to be in class at community college . This semester it 's poetry , but she 's run the gamut . Two summers ago she thought she had me convinced she 'd taken up diving . <p> When she comes in the door a little after nine she sets her clearly untouched poetry book on the end table next to where I am on the couch . <p> " How was it ? " Mr. Arnette asks , smacking his gum and not looking up from the board . <p> " Oh my , " my mother said . " You would n't believe the things those people wrote then . " <p> " Who 'd you do tonight ? " I ask her . It is a game that I have worked up . <p> Sometimes I suspect that Mr. Arnette is playing it as well , but other times I think he 's just being duped by her . You can never tell with Mr. Arnette . Sometimes I imagine he has a secret life , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guy who might have boxes of knickknacks buried all over the world for no reason . <p> " What 's that ? " my mother asks , separating the lashes over one eye , which have been caked with sweat-soaked mascara . <p> " Who 'd you do tonight ? " I put a cigarette in my mouth , wait for one of them to light it . <p> " Oh , Browning , " my mother says . <p> " Which one ? " Mr. Arnette asks . He looks up at me , not her , then takes the lighter from his shirt pocket and snaps on the flame in front of my face , so close I could reach out and swallow it . <p> " Which one ? " she asks . <p> " Which Browning , " Mr. Arnette says . The lighter disappears back into his shirt . <p> My mother misses a beat , then says , " All of them . " <p> She hovers over the Parcheesi board , feigning interest in the game , and her mink stole knocks one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disgusted sigh , although it was him , I know , who bought her the thing . She likes to wear it to work , along with a lot of expensive jewelry . She does not work for her customers , she recently explained to me , she works with them . <p> She pats my head . " About your bedtime , " she says , as if I am twelve and have to get up early to catch the school bus , not eighteen and drugged beyond understanding anything much more difficult than Parcheesi and knowing that my mother , at forty , is sneaking around in motel rooms . <p> My parents were divorced when I was five . I have not seen my father since then , but even so I 've been able to keep track of his moods . If my mother is irritable on Monday nights I know that my father is considering calling everything off . If she is sad I know that he has asked for her back . If she is her usual perky self , like tonight , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met every Monday in the same motel since I was in the sixth grade and playing with lighters under my covers after bedtime . I used to find motel receipts , not even torn or wadded up , but just lying in the kitchen wastebasket next to orange peels and soggy cigarettes , with " Mr. and Mrs. " and then my father 's name following . Still , my mother , through eight years and two more husbands , has never spoken of it to me , and acts as if I could not possibly have figured it out . Thus over the years I have been forced to make up my own story of them : passionate but incompatible , my father a dashing and successful salesman , only through town once a week , only able ( willing ? ) to give my mother three hours . Other times I think it is she who insists on being home each Monday by nine , she that likes doling herself out on her terms , only in small doses . I imagine that they do not talk , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to say anything , and back on by the time they catch their breath . It is easier for me to think of it this way , because I ca n't imagine what they might possibly say to each other . <p> At Neiman Marcus , where my mother works , they found me in a dressing room last winter with a can of lighter fluid and my pockets stuffed with old underwear and dishtowels . This incident was especially distressing because everyone finally thought that after nearly eight years I had been cured , that the fire was gone , that I was no longer a threat to society . The police led me out of the store handcuffed , first through women 's lingerie and then smack past the makeup counter , where my mother was halfway pretending not to know me , or to know me just well enough to be interested in what was taking place . They put me away for almost a year for that one , my third time in the hospital since the first fire . The length of my stay was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of my doctors . The " we 'll teach her " philosophy of psychology . Two months ago they let me out again , into a different world where my mother is married yet again , and I spend my days spitting on dice with her husband and asking politely for matches to light my cigarettes . Either the doctors think I am cured or they have given in , the way I have , the way I did when I was only eleven , when I realized the fire was like blood , water , shelter . Essential . <p> The thing about fire is this : it is yours for one glorious moment . You bear it , you raise it . The first time , in the record store downtown , I stood over the bathroom trash can , thinking I would not let it grow , that I would love it only to a point , and then kill it . That is the trick with fire . For that thirty seconds , you have a choice : spit on it , step on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait one moment too long , get caught up in its beauty , and it has grown beyond your control . And it is that moment that I live for . The relinquishing . The power passes from you to it . The world opens up , and you with it . I cried in the record store when the flame rose above my head : not from fear , but from ecstasy . <p> I sleep sixteen hours a day , more if it 's rainy . Another rationale : enough Xanax and I will be too tired to start fires . I am in bed by ten and do n't get up till nearly noon . Usually I take a nap before dinner . The rest of the time is game time . It 's a murky haze , more often than not . Me forgetting which color I am , what the rules are . Sometimes Mr. Arnette corrects me ; other times he lets it go and it is three turns later by the time I realize I have moved my piece the wrong way on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Seven or eight games a day . We do n't talk much . Mostly we just talk about the game , about the pieces as if they are real people , with spouses and children waiting in some tiny house for them to return from their endless road trips . " In a slump . You 're due , " Mr. Arnette will say to his men . Sometimes he whispers to the dice . I suspect this is all to entertain me , because he is always checking my reaction . Usually I smile . <p> Twice a week Mr. Arnette drives me across town to see my psychiatrist . He reads magazines in the waiting room while I explain to the doctor that I am fine except for the fact that I take so much Xanax I feel my brain has been rewired for a task other than real life . The doctor always nods at this , raising his eyebrows as if I have given him some new information that he will get right on , and then tells me the medication will eventually remedy any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to this , and have learned not to greet with great surprise the fact that no one is going to help me in any way whatsoever . <p> It 's Friday , and on the way home from the doctor 's we drive by a Lions Club carnival that has set up in a park near Mr. Arnette 's house It is twilight , and my mother will be waiting for us at home , but for some reason Mr. Arnette follows the waving arms of a fat clown and pulls into the carnival parking lot . <p> " What do you say ? " he says . He takes a piece of gum from his pocket and puts it in his mouth . <p> I look out the window at the carnival . I do n't get out much . Grocery stores are monumental at this point , and the sight of all these people milling around , the rides , the games , frightens me . A Ferris wheel directly in front of me is spinning around and around , and it makes me dizzy just watching it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . <p> Mr. Arnette chews louder , manipulates the gum into actually sounding frustrated . <p> " I think it 'd be good for you , " he says . He has never said such a thing before , but instead of causing me to feel loved and comforted it makes me nauseous . I 've been told everything from shock treatments to making lanyards would be " good for me , " and in practically this same tone . <p> I feel like crying , and know if I do that he will panic and take me home . But I do n't have the time . He is out of the car before I can well up any tears , and I continue to sit , my seat belt still on , staring out the window into the gray sky . Mr. Arnette stands in front of the fender , gesturing for me to join him . <p> The last time I was at a carnival was the Freshman Fair at my high school , five thousand years ago . I went on a Saturday night with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He held my hand as we walked through the crowds of people and he was sweaty  --  greasy , almost . He stuck his tongue in my ear in the Haunted House ride and I barely noticed because they had a burning effigy of our rival school 's mascot on the wall . The fire licked along the walls and I realized with absolute glee that they had set up one hell of a fire hazard . <p> Mr. Arnette gets back into the car with a sigh , but does not drive away . <p> " You need to get out more , " he says , and I wonder what has changed , wonder if he had a fight with my mother , or sex with my mother , or some other unlikely thing . <p> " Used to take the kids here , " he says , spinning the keys around his finger . I do n't even know his kids ' names . They call occasionally , but he speaks so rarely when he 's on the phone with them that I ca n't pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about work and weather and the price of ground round while he sits on the kitchen stool , picking his fingernails and nodding into the phone . <p> " I 'm not exactly a kid , " I say . <p> " You do n't like carnivals ? " <p> " I just do n't feel like it . " <p> " If she does n't feel like it then she does n't feel like it , " he says , as if there is someone else in the car , another part of him , maybe , who he is arguing with . <p> We continue our drive home in silence . When we stop at a red light he says , " Why do you take all that shit if it makes you feel so bad ? " I laugh at him . It is a question so logical that it pegs him for a fool , and I ca n't believe I 'm really sitting here with him . <p> " It 's not quite that simple , " I say . <p> He shrugs , gives it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fighter , not a radical . Once I came upon him in my bedroom , looking through a photo album of people he had never met . I stood in the doorway and watched him for nearly ten minutes , as he smiled slightly , turning the pages , and I imagined him making up lives for the people in my life . He is that way . Content not to get the whole picture . <p> I 'm standing in the bathroom , trying to stir up enough nerve to just dump them , the whole bottle . My mother taps lightly on the door . I spend more than two minutes in the bathroom and she gets edgy . <p> " Honey ? " <p> " Just a second , " I say . I 'm holding them in my hand , all of them . There must be a million of them , at least , enough to confuse me until I hit menopause . <p> " Are you sick ? " <p> I close my hand around the pills and open the door just far enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mother , " I say . " I 'm fine . I 'm just putting on a little makeup . " <p> This gets her , physically sends her back a step . She wants to believe it so much that I can see her talking herself into it . <p> " But it 's almost time for bed , " she says . <p> " Just to see how it looks , " I say , giving her a big smile through the crack and inching the door closed again . I hear Mr. Arnette 's heavy footsteps come tromping up the stairs . <p> " What 's the fuss ? " he asks . <p> " She 's putting on makeup , " my mother says in a stage whisper . " Maybe she 's trying to look cute for you . " <p> That takes care of my clenched hand . It opens of its own accord at my mother 's words , and the pills sink to the bottom of the toilet , falling to pieces as they go . <p> " I think she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , " I hear my mother say . It is a new tone for her , and this time it 's really a whisper , really some sentiment she does n't want me to hear . I put my ear against the door . " I 'd do anything to make her happy , " she says . It makes my chest hurt , she believes it so much . <p> Sunday has come and my eyes ca n't stay open wide enough . I feel as if I have gotten glasses and a hearing aid over the weekend ; colors are brighter and words sharper . No echoes . Words stop when mouths stop . My mother looks at me suspiciously when she comes into the kitchen early in the morning and finds me cooking bacon . <p> " What 's gotten into you ? " she asks , pleasantly enough , but with a flicker of panic in her face . Me around the oven means bad news for her . <p> But the heat rising from the burners is only making me warm , and the smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of much else . <p> " Just feeling awake , " I say . <p> She smiles , nods , then studies me . <p> " I 'm fine , " I tell her . <p> Mr. Arnette drags into the kitchen , his hair mussed and his robe worn . I have never seen him in the morning , <p> " Well look who 's up , " he says . He winks at me . <p> " Why do n't I finish up and you two go in and start a game , " my mother says brightly . Mr. Arnette sits down at the table and opens the newspaper . <p> " I do n't feel like it , " I say . " Why do n't we do something today ? " <p> " We have to go to a party later , " my mother says , glancing at Mr. Arnette for support . " I do n't think you 'd have very much fun there . " <p> I set a plate of eggs and bacon in front of Mr. Arnette . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You hate eggs , " I say . <p> " We do n't have to go to the party , " Mr. Arnette says . <p> My mother frowns , looks from him to me . <p> " Well I do , " she says . " And I think it would be right for you to come with me . She can take care of herself . " <p> I see my mother now , like she has been stripped down out of her clothes and her skin and even her bones . Her soul is steamed over and dripping fat droplets . <p> " You all go on , " I say . " I do n't mind . " <p> I spend the day with my father . I sit out on the porch with the old photo album . The pictures make sense now , fit into an order I have never seen before . My father as a young man raises a tennis racket over his head . He is swinging at something : a butterfly or a bug , though , not a ball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother pulls his arm , trying to get him to look at the camera . They are so clear now , my father and his bird nose . In one picture he holds me on his lap . I am crying , screaming , and my father is looking at me perplexed . He is barely twenty , I know , and can not believe that I am his . <p> My mother and Mr. Arnette do not come home until late . I 've lost track of time , still sitting with the photo album when the headlights swim into the driveway . They get out of the car and my mother takes Mr. Arnette 's hand , swings it wildly around . <p> " Oh , darling ! " my mother exclaims . I am not sure if it is to me or Mr. Arnette . <p> They are both drunk . My mother stumbles going through the door and Mr. Arnette catches her , leads her inside . Then he comes back out , grunts , and sits down on the porch step . <p> " What have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Looking through this , " I say , holding up the album . <p> He is quiet for a moment . Then he says : " You ever see your father ? " He says it almost as an afterthought , but to something that was n't said . He says it like we 've been on the porch together all night , discussing my father for hours like he was really one of the family . <p> " Just in here , " I say . <p> " Think he 's still a good-looking guy ? " <p> " Dashing , I imagine , " I say . <p> He snorts out a laugh . <p> " Why 'd you marry her ? " I hear myself ask . <p> He leans back , rests his head on the wood inches from my feet . <p> " Company , " he says . He yawns . And I can see him now , too . Safety glass that still shatters . He begins to snore . <p> " Mr. Arnette ? " I say . I reach down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does n't move . <p> I go into the house and up the stairs . Their bedroom door is closed , and I imagine my mother is in about the same shape as he is , but that they will sleep it off in different places , with dreams of different people 's arms . <p> When I open my door , my mother is standing in my room , the empty bottle of Xanax in one hand , the other hand palm up , as if she were questioning someone even before I arrived . <p> " Wait a minute , " I say . " Just wait . " <p> " I knew it , " she says . " I knew there was something wrong . " <p> " Nothing 's wrong , " I say . " What are you doing in my room ? You scared me , standing there like that . " <p> Her mouth opens . " I scared you ? " <p> " I do n't think I need those anymore , " I say . <p> " Forgive me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . <p> I want a cigarette bad . I had to go all night without them , and I go to the dresser for my pack . <p> " A light , " I say . " Do you have a light ? " <p> " Not on your life , " she says . <p> " I 'm fine , " I say . I accidentally break the cigarette between my fingers and reach for another one . <p> She sits down on the bed . " You hurt people , " she says quietly . " Not just me . You think you take those pills because I do n't want you to hurt me ? " <p> " I never hurt anybody , " I say . <p> " You are so lucky , " she says . " You could have killed both of us five times over . In the dressing room , did you ever think about the woman in the next one ? " <p> " I was n't trying to hurt anybody , " I say . " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . She sets the empty bottle on the bed and stands up . " I 'm sorry , " she says . " I can only live with this for so long . " <p> She leaves . I hear her bedroom door close . The house is silent . Below me , Mr. Arnette sleeps on the porch . <p> I sit down on the bed . I am crazy , all right . I have always been crazy . I see my mother standing on the front porch as I get out of my first police car , only fourteen , braces squeezing my teeth . She stares at me in disbelief when the police tell her that I have caused over a thousand dollars in damage at the record store , a thousand dollars with only one match . It is then that she begins to look at me like a stranger . <p> It 's Monday again , and she is in her bedroom preparing . Mr. Arnette sits in the rocking chair watching a basketball game . I am on the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to go back into the hospital , " he says . He does n't look at me . He moves his glasses from hand to hand . <p> " I know , " I say . " It 's O.K. It 's not so bad there . " <p> " Anybody play Parcheesi ? " <p> A man on the court has lost his contact lens . Players are on their knees , hunting . <p> " Cards mostly , " I say . " Lots of jigsaw puzzles . " <p> He nods . " You take those drugs today ? " <p> " No , " I say . " Soon enough . It 's funny , being able to see so well . But not great so much . " <p> My mother comes into the room and picks up her purse . " Have a good game , " she says . She kisses Mr. Arnette on the top of the head , presses her lips into his hair for a long time , until he moves away . <p> " What was that for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell . <p> " It does n't have to be for anything , does it ? " she says . She smiles at me , lingers for a moment as if she has something to add but can not remember what it could have been , and then she leaves . <p> Mr. Arnette swings the rocking chair around and faces me . " You do n't have to go , " he says . " Imagine me here , all by myself . " <p> " You 'll do O.K. , " I say . " Come visit . " <p> He nods , picks up the poetry book from the coffee table where my mother has left it , absently flips through it . <p> " She did n't even think to take it along , " he says . <p> " She does n't try so hard anymore , " I say . " To fool anybody . " <p> He stops on a page , squints at it , puts on his glasses . " Here 's one you 'd like , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fire , others say in ice . " He stops , looks up at me and raises his eyebrows . <p> " I 'd like to see them , " I say . I hear my mother 's car start up in the driveway . " lust one time , see them together . Be a fly on the wall . " <p> " We can be flies together , " he says . <p> It is not a long drive , only a few miles , much too close as far as I 'm concerned , for something that seems like it must be another world . Mr. Arnette stays a few cars behind her , then drives past the motel after she pulls into the lot . He drives around the block twice , the three times . <p> " What are you waiting for ? " I ask him . <p> " A reason not to do this , " he says . He presses down the accelerator and we speed past the motel again . We drive around the city , looking at closed-down stores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we really have nowhere to go . He finally makes his way back to the motel , and this time he pulls into the lot . We park at the far end and walk along the row of empty spaces , toward my mother 's car . The motel is nearly empty , but the room next to her car is occupied . The shade on the window is up a couple of inches . Mr. Arnette squats down , then reaches for me . <p> I close one eye and look inside . The bathroom light is on , the door open , and I can see my mother gingerly applying her eye shadow in front of the mirror . There is a man in the bed , sitting up , yawning . He stretches his skinny arms . He is nearly bald , but has a small mustache under his pointed nose . It is a stranger , no one I have ever seen before . <p> " He looks a lot different than the pictures , " Mr. Arnette whispers . <p> " It 's not him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say this I know that it is . <p> Mr. Arnette looks at me . " Sweetheart ... " he says . <p> My mother shuts off the bathroom light and I can see her silhouette move to the edge of the bed . She sits down and touches the man on the chest , running her finger from his throat to his waist . He takes her hand and puts the finger in his mouth . It is like watching shadows . She says something I can not make out . Is it about me ! Of course , I realize , it is not . <p> I shiver in the cold . Mr. Arnette takes off his sweater and sets it around my shoulders . <p> The man begins to put his clothes on , slowly . Next to me , I hear Mr. Arnette 's breath catch . <p> " What is it ? " I whisper . I wonder if he can be jealous , if he cares that much . <p> He only shakes his head . " Chilling , " he whispers . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people . " <p> They are sitting on the edge of the bed together . My mother fumbles for her purse , takes out a pack of cigarettes , gives one to my father and takes one for herself . She lights them both . <p> " Where will we go ? " Mr. Arnette whispers . <p> " What ? " I say . <p> They are holding hands on the bed . The shadow of smoke drifts above them , the tiny circles of fire all that light the room . <p> " Where will we go ? " he says again . I lean in against him . He is warm . <p> Inside the room is quiet . Together the man and the woman raise the cigarettes to their mouths . For a moment , the faces of my parents glow in the darkness . Then Mr. Arnette takes me by the arm and actually lifts me off the ground . <p> " Wait , " I say . " Wait . " But I do n't fight him . I want him to take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are three blocks from the motel before he remembers to turn on his headlights . <p> " Slow down , " I say . " You 're gon na kill us both . " I take out a cigarette and push the car lighter in . <p> " Jesus Christ , " he says . " What would she do then ? " For a moment he is insane , so much more than I ever could have hoped to be . <p> There are lights up ahead . Music . It is the carnival , its last night , in full swing . The car wildly spits up gravel as Mr. Arnette rumbles across the lot . He jumps out of the car , dashes forward a few feet , then turns and slams his fist into the hood . Then he is perfectly still . He looks straight at me , and I am afraid to move . The cigarette lighter clicks out . A father rushes his children into the back of the station wagon next to us , where they look at us through the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter out , touch my fingers close enough to the middle to feel the raw heat . Then I light my cigarette and blow smoke into the windshield . Mr. Arnette watches me . I know now that he will never go back to my mother , will probably never lay eyes on her again . Something about seeing them , even though he knew . Something about seeing them . <p> He turns and starts walking towards the ticket booth . I get out of the car and follow him , stand behind him smoking while he buys two tickets . <p> " Ferris wheel , " he says , turning to me . He smiles slightly . " None of those puke rides . Slow . Slow rides tonight . " <p> We get into a car that I 'm sure is broken . It swings differently than the others , crooked somehow . I start to say something , but a girl with yellow teeth and matching hair closes the bar over us and we are suddenly moving in a great lurch forward . <p> " Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking down onto the park . <p> " These things are dangerous , " I say . <p> " Bullshit , " he says . " We 're safer up here than anywhere else in the world . " <p> We screech to a halt near the top , for the loading of passengers into the cars below us . We swing crookedly over the game booths , and I can see us , crashing down into the middle of the ring toss . So many ways to buy it , so few to stay alive . <p> " I 've always liked the looks of Canada , " Mr. Arnette says . He is smiling pleasantly , innocent as the dawn . <p> We start moving again . The motion is hypnotizing , and I no longer feel sick , but only strange , detached . <p> " Nice night for driving , " I hear myself say . <p> He does n't answer . He is looking at my hands , which are open , palms up on my lap , as if I am waiting for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and takes out his pack of gum . He sets it in my hand , and my fingers close around it . <p> We swing around again . Below me , I see a circle of teenagers standing around a small bonfire , warming their hands . Sparks pop around them and die in the grass as the flame reaches higher . The Ferris wheel whips us towards it , and then away again , up into the night . <p>
