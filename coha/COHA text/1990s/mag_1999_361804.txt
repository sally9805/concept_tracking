Hashim Thaci is on unfamiliar ground . The Albanian guerrilla leader , once the bane of Serbian forces in Kosovo 's hinterlands , has arrived triumphant in Pristina and is undergoing his first rite of passage as an aspiring politician : dinner with TIME . Looking out across a table laden with the best postwar cuisine available  --  three platters of chicken franks , canned tuna and tomatoes  --  the 30-year-old rebel answers questions with a voice at once shy and calculating . Trying his best to toe the Western line , he assures us repeatedly , " We will live up to the obligations given to us . " But as dinner stretches to midnight , Thaci begins to flag . Perhaps it is the endless days of negotiations with the U.S. or the months of war or just the barrage of journalists ' questions about how exactly he hopes to fix this shattered land . Even the lady of the rented house , Mevlyde Kadriu , has questions : " Well , when are we going back to our jobs ? " she asks boldly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblique evasions and turns back to his demitasse of Nescafe . <P> As revolutionaries go , Thaci has a dream resume . Young , attractive and toting a sexy nickname , " the Snake , " he is the face of the Kosovo Liberation Army . The glamour is burnished by accomplishment : Kosovar Albanians see him as the man who got them NATO military support and the right to an autonomous existence . And he has become the go-to man in postwar Kosovo . When the generals of the KFOR ( Kosovo Force ) peacekeeping troops and K.L.A. commanders could not arrive at an agreement to demilitarize the rebel army , they called Thaci to find a solution . <P> But when it comes to politics , the Snake is still a rank amateur . Kosovo is in ruins , his rebel army is edgy about its demilitarization , and political rivals on all sides are waiting for him to slip up . He 'll also face political challenges at home  --  most notably from the elected President of Kosovo , Ibrahim Rugova , and from newspaper publisher Veton Surroi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least temporarily , as its man . On a visit to Pristina last week , State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin took Thaci for a highly public cup of coffee at a well-known downtown cafe . And in a busy week last week , the U.S. and NATO began putting Thaci through what some were calling " democracy school , " educating him about everything from elections ( he was out kissing babies one morning ) to dealing with journalists ( his dinner with TIME ) . <P> Thaci started his political life in the student union of Pristina University in the late ' 80s , associating with a radical Marxist-Leninist group that previously had ties to Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha . After graduating with a degree in history in 1991 , Thaci grew impatient with political conspiracy as a way to kick Slobodan Milosevic out of Kosovo . In June 1993 he and his compatriots turned to military action . Along with his two most trusted associates , Kadri Veseli and Fatmir Limaj , he launched one of the first armed attacks against Serbian forces . By the time Kosovo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprisals and was at the top of the disparate guerrilla force .
