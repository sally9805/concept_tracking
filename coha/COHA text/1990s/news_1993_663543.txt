<p> Whether it 's the ivy on the walls at Wrigley Field , the Green Monster at Fenway Park or the water fountains in Kansas City , every major league ballpark has a unique touch . <p> Some things are easy to spot , such as the hotel rooms overlooking the outfield at Toronto 's SkyDome , the mechanical tarp in St. Louis and Bernie Brewer in Milwaukee . Others are out of sight , like the mood room in Philadelphia and the kennel at Comiskey Park . <p> And yes , there are even distinguishing touches in Philadelphia , Pittsburgh and Cincinnati , the three most similar stadiums in the majors . <p> A look at each ballpark in the big leagues , and what makes it different : <p> AMERICAN LEAGUE <p> Oriole Park at Camden Yards <p> Baltimore Orioles <p> Opened : 1992 . Capacity : 48,000 <p> The grass always looks greener at this showplace , and the Orioles make sure it stays that way with their own sod farm . Beyond the center-field fence and tucked between the scoreboard and the bullpens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass . If a divot develops , head groundskeeper Paul Zwaska simply transplants a piece onto the field , rather than sending out for fresh sod , like most clubs . <p> When he managed the team at Memorial Stadium , Earl Weaver used his favorite plant food to grow tomatoes down the left-field line . The bluegrass at Camden Yards is a special blend , too , of three varieties - Touchdown , Eclipse and Midnight . <p> Fenway Park <p> Boston Red Sox <p> Opened : 1912 . Capacity : 33,925 <p> The famous left-field wall is great to look at , but it 's no fun to work inside the hand-operated scoreboard . The conditions are cramped , it 's hot and there are rats . <p> A rat , in fact , may have been responsible for the great shot from inside the Green Monster of Carlton Fisk hitting the home run that won Game 6 of the 1975 World Series . As the story goes , the cameraman was supposed to follow the flight of the ball . But when he saw a rat at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than tilting down near the rodent . <p> Anaheim Stadium <p> California Angels <p> Opened : 1966 . Capacity : 64,593 <p> It 's one of the stranger sights in the majors , seeing several Angels relievers seemingly sitting in the first row of the stands . Actually , they 're on a platform above the bullpen . <p> The Angels shifted bullpen positions from right field to left this season , but the California pitchers complained that they could not see well through a small opening in the fence . The club gave them their own area , and did n't worry about blocking anyone 's view - that used to be the family section , but the Angels found out that few fans wanted to sit there . <p> Comiskey Park <p> Chicago White Sox <p> Opened : 1991 . Capacity : 44,321 <p> Want to go to the game , but do n't want to leave your pooch at home ? No problem for White Sox fans . <p> Comiskey Park has a " pet check " in center field , where there are six kennels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost is $ 3 and food , water and a relieving area are provided . If requested , a doggie bag of food is given for the ride home . <p> The hound hotel is a big hit , although not always big enough . <p> " One woman from Milwaukee called to see if she could check her mascot cow , " says Julie Taylor , keeper of the kennels , " but we told her it would n't fit . " <p> Cleveland Stadium <p> Cleveland Indians <p> Opened : 1932 . Capacity : 74,483 <p> You may not have heard of John Adams , but you 've probably heard him . He 's the guy in right field banging that big bass drum . On Aug. 24 , he 'll celebrate his 20th anniversary at the park , and he 's sure seen his share of losing . Since he started , only once have the Indians finished within 10 games of first place . <p> Adams played the drums in the band at St. Ignatius and Parma High School , and wanted to help the Tribe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one fan complained , he was out . Adams , 41 , passed that test , and now plans to follow the club when it moves to a new park next season . <p> " I 'm going to miss the Stadium , " he says . " All the real baseball fans in Cleveland will miss it . " <p> Tiger Stadium <p> Detroit Tigers <p> Opened : 1912 . Capacity : 52,416 <p> In old minor league parks , there were trees , railroad tracks and hills in the outfield . In these modern majors , there 's only one major object in play - the flagpole in center field at Tiger Stadium . <p> The blue pole is planted in the grass two feet inside the fence , about 415 feet from the plate . It 's 125 feet high and has been there since the ballpark was called Briggs Stadium . A few years ago , a yellow line was painted nine feet up , and any ball that hits above the marker is a home run . <p> " Nobody ever figures that the flagpole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly a Hall of Fame outfielder for the Tigers and now one of the team 's announcers . " The funniest thing I saw , someone hit a ball , it went around the flagpole , and Jimmy Piersall squeezed around the pole and fence and chased it . <p> " The only time I saw it as a factor was when Chet Lemon hit one off the pole , about 20 feet up , but not a home run . It 's not usually a factor , " he says . " I really have n't seen anyone ever run into it . " <p> Kauffman Stadium <p> Kansas City Royals <p> Opened : 1973 . Capacity : 40,625 <p> Despite its AstroTurf , traditionalists praise this pretty park , which was called Royals Stadium before its recent renaming . And its most attractive feature is the water spectacular in the outfield , which was the idea of owner Ewing Kauffman 's wife , Muriel . The 322-foot wide display is the largest privately funded fountain in the world . <p> In 1980 , however , when Jim Frey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody " almost hit one to the water trough . " The next day , he got a hand-written note from Muriel which said , " We paid $ 1 million for that thing . Please refer to it as a water display . " <p> County Stadium <p> Milwaukee Brewers <p> Opened : 1953 . Capacity : 53,192 <p> For the first time in many years , Bernie Brewer is back this season . One of baseball 's most recognized mascots , he sits on his chalet in center field , waiting for a hometown home run so he can celebrate by sliding into a big mug of beer . <p> In the days of Harvey 's Wallbangers in the early 1980s , it was hard to tell who liked Bernie Brewer the most . Sure , the fans enjoyed him , but so did the players - especially because he sat at the front of the bleachers and used white gloves to flash the catcher 's signs to the Milwaukee batters . Eventually , he was caught and moved to the back of the stands . <p> Hubert H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capacity : 55,883 <p> When the fans get in a frenzy , this becomes the loudest park in the majors . The din was so defeaning during the 1987 World Series that St. Louis pitcher Joe Magrane wore ear plugs when he started Game 1 . They did n't help as the decibel level reached 110 , a point or two higher than the sound of a jet plane during takeoff at close range . <p> Matt Hoy , vice president of operations for the Twins , says one reason the sound reverberates so much is that the Teflon-coated Fiberglas ceiling has an inner and outer layer . The noise , loud enough to disorient opposing teams , might be why the Twins are 11-1 in postseason games inside their DecibelDome . <p> Yankee Stadium <p> New York Yankees <p> Opened : 1923 . Capacity : 57,545 <p> The Yankees always have paid tribute to their heroes , honoring the likes of Lou Gehrig , Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio with monuments . For many years , the monuments were mounted in deep center field and were in play , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years ago , when Yankee Stadium was remodeled , the plaques were placed in a park behind the fences so that all fans could visit them . <p> There is , though , one shrine the crowds can not see . At the back of the Yankees clubhouse , near the trainer 's room , the locker stall that Thurman Munson used remains untouched . His uniform with No. 15 hangs neatly , and a few of his mementos are inside . It 's been that way since the team captain was killed in a plane crash on Aug. 2 , 1979 , and you still see Yankees new and old observing it silently . <p> Oakland Coliseum <p> Oakland Athletics <p> Opened : 1968 . Capacity : 47,313 <p> Wade Boggs and other hitters believe it 's not fair how much foul territory there is at this place . The Coliseum has more foul ground than any park in the majors and it often comes into play . <p> Willie McGee , playing his first game for Oakland , scored from first base on a wild pickoff throw to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . Slower players routinely take two bases , instead of one , when balls get past the first baseman . In all , it 's about 90 feet to the stands , more than double the space at some stadiums . <p> While bad throws can be costly , most pitchers love Oakland . That 's because so many foul balls are caught , including rare popups by Boggs , that ERAs usually get reduced . <p> Kingdome <p> Seattle Mariners <p> Opened : 1977 . Capacity : 58,823 <p> There 's not a lot of personality to this park , but there are plenty of speakers suspended from the roof . Six of them hang above the outfield in fair territory and six more are in foul ground . All of them , and their attached wires , are in play . <p> Each year , a few balls that seem headed for home runs hit the speakers and bounce back . In May , Ken Griffey Jr . became the only player in Kingdome history to hit a home-run ball that hit a speaker and wound up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " Mariners longtime catcher Dave Valle says . " I think they 're terrible . They cost me a home run a couple of years ago . " <p> Arlington Stadium <p> Texas Rangers <p> Opened : 1965 . Capacity : 43,521 <p> Even major leaguers become kids when they get around Nolan Ryan , whose presence dominates this place . And with Ryan in his final season , a lot of players want a souvenir from Big Tex . <p> But , Ryan and the Rangers realize that he can not be spending all of his time signing autographs . In the visitors ' clubhouse , therefore , a sign has been posted asking opposing players to ask Ryan for autographs only on the middle day of a series . Also , it is recommended that they seek just a couple of signatures , not a whole stack . Needless to say , this is the only sign of its kind in the majors , and maybe in all of sports . The line forms at the right . <p> SkyDome <p> Toronto Blue Jays <p> Opened : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 hotel rooms in the outfield , some of them costing more than $ 800 per night , is certainly unique . So was the view into one of them above the center-field scoreboard during a game between Seattle and Toronto on May 15 , 1990 . <p> A man and woman , bored with the events on the field , began a game of their own in the bedroom . The couple apparently believed the glass was tinted and that no one could not see in . Wrong . And with the black drapes left open , many of the 41,108 fans saw the whole thing . Since then , guests must sign a waiver promising no replays . The hotel , meanwhile , has gotten hundreds of requests to rent that same room . It all was enough to make some wonder whether the name of the stadium should be changed to Exhibition Stadium , too . <p> NATIONAL LEAGUE <p> Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium <p> Atlanta Braves <p> Opened : 1966 . Capacity : 52,709 <p> Once John Smoltz discovered one drain in the Braves ' clubhouse , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smoltz , an avid golfer who shoots in the 70s , set up a putting green . <p> Paper cups have been placed inside the drains , and there are four holes laid out over a 60-foot course on the blue carpet . Before games , most everyone on the team takes part . Starting pitchers Tom Glavine , Steve Avery , Greg Maddux , Pete Smith and Smoltz make up the most fearsome fivesome . <p> " We do n't know who founded it , " Glavine says . " We think it was John , but even if it was n't , he 'll take credit for it . " <p> Wrigley Field <p> Chicago Cubs <p> Opened : 1914 . Capacity : 38,756 <p> Bill Veeck was one of baseball 's biggest innovators , putting an exploding scoreboard in old Comiskey Park and letting midget Eddie Gaedel bat for the St. Louis Browns . Not everyone knows , however , about his most visible effect . <p> Veeck was the one who put ivy on the brick walls of Wrigley Field . In 1938 , he strung bittersweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the base . <p> The ivy leaves begin to turn green in late May and start to die in September , just like the Cubs sometimes . Outfielders used to scramble through the vines , searching for lost balls . But they realized that if they found them , the balls were in play and might become triples . Instead , it was better to throw up their hands and take the ground-rule double . <p> Riverfront Stadium <p> Cincinnati Reds <p> Opened : 1970 . Capacity : 52,952 <p> Pete Rose left his mark all over the park , not that any first-time visitor would know it . <p> Inside the stadium , Rose became baseball 's hits leader , ran over Ray Fosse in the 1970 All-Star game and sparked the Big Red Machine to two World Series championships . For all that , though , there are no retired numbers , no monuments and no statues honoring the banned hero . There was a circle painted in the outfield where his record 4,192nd hit landed in 1985 , but it was washed away for the next Bengals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose was ever here was put up by Rose himself . When he was chasing Ty Cobb 's hit record , Rose hung a picture of Cobb in the manager 's office . There have been several changes in the office since Rose was forced out , but , curiously , the picture of the man he pursued remains . <p> Mile High Stadium <p> Colorado Rockies <p> Opened : 1948 . Capacity : 76,100 <p> Before the season began , Rockies manager Don Baylor wanted to remind opposing teams how hard it was to breathe in Denver , so he insisted a sign be put on the right-field wall , directly facing the visitor 's dugout : " Mile High Stadium , Elevation 5,200 Ft . " <p> Baylor , though , has gotten to see how easy it is for teams to hit home runs off his pitching staff in the thin air . It is estimated that balls travel 10 percent farther in the higher altitude , and Pittsburgh manager Jim Leyland proved it last month . As a minor league catcher , Leyland hit only four home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no trouble hitting one over the fence in batting practice . <p> Joe Robbie Stadium <p> Florida Marlins <p> Opened : 1987 . Capacity : 48,000 <p> It sounds like something dreamed up by a pitcher having a bad day : a mound that disappears . The mound in Miami can electronically be lowered 3 feet below the field , allowing workers to convert the surface from baseball to football , and vice-versa . <p> The disappearing mound was installed prior to this season and has yet to be used , although it would have come in handy during a few of the expansion Marlins ' games . " You just throw a switch , " stadium manager Glenn Mon said . " I will not tell you where the switch is . " <p> Astrodome <p> Houston Astros <p> Opened : 1965 . Capacity : 53,821 <p> Whether the Astros are winning or losing , their fans never have any trouble getting comfortable because the Astrodome is the only park in the majors that has theater-style seats . <p> No chairs molded out of plastic or seats made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each seat has four inches of padding , comes with full armrests and is contoured to fit a fan 's back . Among the former usherettes who used to show fans to those seats was Denise Jackson , who met Ozzie Smith at the park in 1978 when he played for San Diego and married him two years later . <p> Dodger Stadium <p> Los Angeles Dodgers <p> Opened : 1962 . Capacity : 56,000 <p> There are two things you always see when you watch a game from Los Angeles : a spectacular view at dusk beyond the fences , past the palm trees and toward the mountains , and Mike Brito with his radar gun behind home plate . <p> Brito , a former Triple-A catcher , found Fernando Valenzuela in Mexico and signed him . Since then , Brito has been a regular at Dodger Stadium , usually wearing a neat black suit and wide-brimmed white hat . He stands in a section of the dugout boxes , seats that cost $ 13 and are sold out . High rollers want them , although they have a drawback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dugout , making it hard to see well past the pitcher . <p> Olympic Stadium <p> Montreal Expos <p> Opened : 1977 . Capacity : 46,500 <p> Hailed as a wonder of architecture when it was built for the 1976 Summer Olympics , the Big O has become known locally as the Big Owe because it has cost Montreal taxpayers about $ 1 billion . <p> The image of the ballpark was never real attractive , mainly because of an ugly construction crane that sat behind the center-field fence for 11 years . In 1991 , a windstorm ripped a hole in the Kevlar roof and two months later the stadium was closed after a 55-ton chunk of concrete fell . The stadium had the world 's first retractable roof ; it has not been opened for a game since the start of the 1992 season , although it has recently been tested late at night . <p> Shea Stadium <p> New York Mets <p> Opened : 1964 . Capacity : 55,601 <p> Plain and simple , a lot of players hate this place because of the noisy planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing approach to nearby LaGuardia Airport and at peak periods , jets swoop over every minute or so . <p> Keith Hernandez was among the many Mets who stepped out of the batter 's box when planes flew by . But Rusty Staub used to encourage his teammates to swing away because outfielders could not hear the sound of the bat hitting the ball . Everyone gets a break once the U.S. Open starts in late August at the adjacent National Tennis Center . At the urging of Mayor David Dinkins , a big tennis fan , planes are diverted to different runways . <p> Veterans Stadium <p> Philadelphia Phillies <p> Opened : 1971 . Capacity : 62,382 <p> When Steve Carlton was winning Cy Young Awards , it was important to him to be in the right frame of mind , and the Phillies were willing to do anything to accommodate their ace . So they built the Mood Room . <p> More than 10 years later , it still exists inside the clubhouse . The room is the size of a large closet and contains a leather recliner that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2 - by- 3- foot screen showing an ocean scene with waves crashing against rocks and sea gulls flying overhead . The ceiling and walls are carpeted , there are recessed lights that can be dimmed and there is a stereo system for soothing music . <p> Three Rivers Stadium <p> Pittsburgh Pirates <p> Opened : 1970 . Capacity : 47,972 <p> When the Pirates moved into their new park , they realized it was worth preserving part of the past . A section of the brick wall from Forbes Field , which had opened in 1909 , was shown in the Allegheny Club , a private restaurant located along the right-field line . The piece remains on display . <p> Meanwhile , a large statue honoring Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente is set to be unveiled at Three Rivers during next year 's All-Star game . Pirates player Orlando Merced , who grew up down the street from Clemente 's house in Puerto Rico , recently mailed a letter to other major leaguers seeking contributions . <p> Busch Stadium <p> St. Louis Cardinals <p> Opened : 1966 . Capacity : 56,627 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1967 : Why not install the only mechanical tarpaulin in the majors , too ? <p> And it was good , except for that October day during the 1985 playoffs when the 1,200-pound automatic tarp , moving slower than a half-mile per hour , caught Vince Coleman , the fastest player in the game . The accident left Coleman with a chipped bone in his left knee and ended his postseason , but there have been no problems since then , partly because a warning bell was added . <p> At the push of a button , the tarp lifts out of a 3-foot by 180-foot space halfway between the Cardinals dugout and the first-base line . The grounds crew just watches as the tarp takes four minutes to roll over the infield . <p> San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium <p> San Diego Padres <p> Opened : 1969 . Capacity : 59,700 <p> If the team stinks , it may not be because of the players . Scores of skunks live under the stands . In addition , owls inhabit the light towers , and coyotes , foxes and raccoons tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk into the park late at night . <p> " It 's the river that sustains the wildlife . It 's an ecological balance , " stadium manager Bill Wilson says . " About once a year I give a zoological report to the stadium committee and they get a kick out of it . Nobody 's got anything like we do . " <p> The grounds crew has been taught how to herd skunks , which are then released in the woods . One year , 44 skunks were caught . The total for this year so far is 30 . <p> Candlestick Park <p> San Francisco Giants <p> Opened : 1960 . Capacity : 62,000 <p> From the start , the Giants blew it . Owner Horace Stoneham was purposely shown the site by city officials early in the day , before the winds began whipping off San Francisco Bay , and team has been stuck with the coldest , clammiest and most unpopular park in baseball ever since . <p> A year after the stadium opened , Stu Miller was blown off the mound during the All-Star game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always been a problem , and occasionally fog rolls in and causes delays . <p> Once , manager Roger Craig grew tired of the grousing and threatened to fine any of his players who complained about Candlestick . That did n't stop former Cubs pitcher Ed Lynch , who simply said : " They ought to drop a bomb on this place . "
