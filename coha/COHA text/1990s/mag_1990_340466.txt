Kremlin atheists quietly supervise the selection of Moscow 's Russian Orthodox Patriarchs . Turkey 's government leaders , though Muslims , are said to weigh in when Ecumenical Patriarchs are chosen . But imagine Italy 's Prime Minister appointing a Pope , or President Bush picking the Presiding Bishop of his Episcopal Church . Just such a church-state mesh will occur in Britain in the coming months as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher prepares to choose the next Archbishop of Canterbury , head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of some 70 million Anglicans and Episcopalians worldwide . <P> The process began last week when Robert Runcie announced that he will step down next January , eight months shy of mandatory retirement at age 70 . Like all English bishops , his successor will be named by the Prime Minister and formally appointed by the Queen . Thatcher , raised as a Methodist , is probably not sorry to see Runcie go : she has been vexed by his pleas for the suffering poor under her economic policies and doubtless agrees with Peterborough 's Bishop William Westwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile " under its next leader . <P> Following a procedure revised in 1977 , candidates for the post will be selected by a panel of bishops , priests and lay people chosen by the church , with a Thatcher appointee in charge . The panel will propose two names to the Prime Minister in order of preference . She gains further leverage through her power to reject both names and demand new ones , although such a move would be extraordinary . <P> Runcie , named in 1980 , is universally admired as a man . But as a church leader he is faulted by both liberals and traditionalists for chronic indecision . Runcie 's defenders say his cautious style helped work a miracle or two in preventing world Anglicanism from flying apart over women priests and bishops . Yet the compromises he engineered merely paper over the fact that the Anglican Communion is barely a Communion any longer . Some of its 27 autonomous national branches  --  including the U.S. Episcopal Church  --  ordain women priests , who are not recognized by Runcie 's mother church and other branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by women bishops will further muddy the waters . <P> Meanwhile , the Church of England is fast fading as any kind of force in the nation 's life . The church 's regular worshipers constitute a paltry 2.4% of the population . Only 29% of England 's babies are baptized as Anglicans . The decline had set in long before Runcie 's reign , but he proved powerless to stop it . With England becoming a mission field , the future may lie with the Evangelical wing , which runs some thriving parishes and is gaining the majority among priests .
