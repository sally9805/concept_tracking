One reason that so-called gotcha journalism  --  campaign coverage dominated by attempts to reveal youthful misbehavior  --  seems to have arrived so abruptly is that Fifties Guys were skipped when the presidency passed from World War II Guys to Boomers . Two or three presidential elections with Fifties Guys as candidates would have provided a soothing way of putting off such harsh subjects as coke snorting and draft dodging until we 'd had time to gain the perspective that comes with a little distance  --  soothing because Fifties Guys tend not to have engaged in any youthful misbehavior interesting enough for anyone to bother revealing . <P> Fifties Guys are people who graduated from college in the years from the early Fifties to around 1965 , when what is now spoken of as the Sixties started to get in gear . As a Fifties Guy myself , I can testify that going to college in that era had all the excitement of standing at the luggage carousel waiting for your bags to come off the plane . <P> In our defense , opportunities for disgraceful behavior were limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting wars to slither out of . The term recreational drugs  --  a term that was invented to make what privileged people do sound less depraved than it would if it were done by poor people  --  had not been coined . The sort of state lawbreaking that Fifties Guys were associated with was underage drinking . The sort of federal lawbreaking that Fifties Guys were associated with was underage drinking with a fake draft card . Reading about the recent accusations against George W. Bush , I could imagine one of my classmates ' saying wistfully , " I might have tried cocaine if I 'd ever heard of it . " <P> Fifties Guys got shut out of the White House because a couple of World War II Guys , Ronald Reagan and George Bush , won the presidency when they were old enough to be thinking about retirement , and then a Boomer , Bill Clinton , won when he was still in his 40s . If the World War II Guys had n't been so reluctant to leave the stage and Bill Clinton had permitted the Fifties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still might not have reached the point of talking about who " experimented " with drugs ( another usage invented for the privileged ) . <P> When Clinton ran again as an incumbent , he might have been expected to face a Fifties Guy  --  some 58-year-old Governor or 61-year-old Senator or Jack Kemp ( Occidental College , class of ' 57 ) who got the vice-presidential nomination . Instead , the Republican ticket was led by Bob Dole , another World War II Guy , who was running for President in his 73rd year . Now the leading candidates for 2000 , Bush the Younger and Al Gore , are both Boomers . After 1996 , we Fifties Guys had to face the cold , hard fact that our one shot at the White House might have been lost when Michael Dukakis peered out of that tank . <P> But is it really all over for us unless John McCain 's long-shot-maverick strategy has unexpected appeal to those who decide the Republican nomination ? Maybe not . The Ames straw poll was led by Bush and Steve Forbes , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth Dole  --  Duke , class of ' 58 , and not even a fake draft card among her youthful follies . When it comes to presidential politics , Elizabeth Dole may be the last of the Fifties Guys .
