<p> AMNESTY ON IN-LAW UNITS IS A BAD IDEA <p> Editor  --  The proposals by Supervisors Mabel Teng and Tom Ammiano which would give amnesty to property owners of illegal in-law units is totally improper . This is the fourth attempt in eight years that city officials have tried this end-around tactic to change zoning laws and significantly change the character of our city 's neighborhoods . <p> Not only would this single- family to multiple-family zoning change go against the mandates of voter-approved Proposition M , which guarantees to maintain the unique characteristics of the different areas of the city , but this so-called " amnesty " would create unbelievable legal problems in neighborhoods like ours where there are contracts between property owners and their homeowner associations restricting second living units . <p> Respectfully , we ask these supervisors to withdraw this amnesty proposal . The single-family character and uncongested atmosphere of neighborhoods like ours are the reasons people move here . <p> DAVID BISHO <p> President <p> Westwood Highlands <p> Homeowners Association <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ' WHAT A DEAL ! ' <p> Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-family home . Supervisors Ammiano and Teng want to offer me amnesty for this unit ( Chronicle , September 16 ) . I could then pay the city a $ 5,000 inspection fee for the privilege of having the city tell me to whom , for how long and for how much I can rent out this part of my home . What a deal ! How could I turn it down ? <p> RICK EMMONS <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> BOYCOTT NORTH CAROLINA <p> Editor  --  Three cheers for your editorial , " A Helms ' Hammerlock " ( Chronicle , September 16 ) . Helms is an embarrassment to the U.S. Senate , the country and to the state of North Carolina . <p> I 've concluded , though , that the man just does n't know any better and that the fault lies with how he got to the Senate in the first place , i.e. , the voters of North Carolina . <p> What to do ? The Helms-Burton Act inspires an idea : an embargo probably is n't feasible , but why not a campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled ? It might work . <p> BERNARD J. HARGADON Jr . <p> Orinda <p> . <p> WELD 'S CHARADE <p> Editor  --  With a pout , a sneer and a parting shot at Senator Helms , former Massachusetts Governor Weld withdrew his nomination for the ambassadorship to Mexico , a day after asserting his commitment to pursue the nomination . Accusing Senator Helms , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , of " ideological extortion , " Mr. Weld fades from Washington self-righteously wrapped in the mantle of victimhood . <p> Weld 's pursuit of this nomination was a charade intended to establish his liberal/moderate political credentials on the national stage , and in doing so , clearly juxtapose his politics with those of conservatives who , he asserts , have hijacked the GOP . Going toe-to-toe with Jesse Helms and the right wing of the GOP was merely tactical . <p> That the process has been so crude and naive is surprising , because Mr. Weld did not have a reputation as a stupid politician . That President Clinton and the Democrats perceived this confrontation as a no-lose proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Democrats benefit . That The Chronicle weighs in with a condemnation of Senator Helms is also not surprising . Such a knee-jerk reaction is to be expected . It was clearly intended by Mr. Weld and his advisers . <p> DAVID DONNELLY <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> GOP NEEDS WELD <p> Editor  --  What a pity that a fine , outstanding man who governed Massachusetts most efficiently , is lost to us as ambassador to Mexico where he could have been effective . <p> Let 's not lose this qualified individual who could provide much needed , valuable leadership to the moderate side of the Republican Party . <p> Shame on you , Jesse Helms . <p> CHOTSIE BLANK <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> AIDS STIGMA <p> Editor  --  Thank you for reporting that the New England Journal of Medicine is now calling for mandatory reporting of HIV . Does the NEJM really believe that attitudes toward AIDS are shifting or that the social stigma of AIDS is fading ? <p> Just last week , I read in another newspaper that a 9-year-old girl has been banished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is HIV-positive  --  not because she has done anything bad or hurt anybody . And do n't forget Ryan White . If this is the way heterosexual HIV-positives are still being treated , what can lesbian and gay HIV-positives expect from mandatory reporting ? <p> The journal 's deputy editor stated that federal regulations could be written to assure that people with HIV will have their privacy safeguarded and be safe from discrimination  --  just tell that to all the public officials and special interest groups who oppose anti-discrimination laws because they think that equal rights are special rights . <p> We are also supposed to believe that all the names that go into this wonderful collection will be confidential . Just ask all the people whose Social Security earnings data ended up on the Internet for the perusal of anybody armed with a minimum of personal information . <p> REBECCA WOO <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> COACH RUSH DEFENDED <p> Editor  --  I resent the manner in which The Chronicle has characterized City College football Coach George Rush 's heroic history of 20 years , inculcating strong principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenship . <p> For someone who has followed City College football assiduously for decades , and who personally raised $ 35,000 to take the 1984 team to England for an unprecedented American football game with an English team , I know the vicissitudes Coach Rush has endured in preparing his teams and the members thereof for football and life in general . <p> City College players are almost entirely from low- and middle-income families . They are taught to graduate with an Associate of Arts degree , obey the law and play good , clean football . They do . To contort Coach Rush 's performance and the attractiveness of City College football for high school players in other states into a " scandal " insults the bona fides and sincerity of George Rush , Dan Hayes and all the other football coaches and players at City College . <p> Senator QUENTIN KOPP <p> ( I-San Francisco/San Mateo ) <p> . <p> ' FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE ' <p> Editor  --  I am writing this letter to say that I enjoy the comic strip " For Better or For Worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny comic strips that I know of . Furthermore , it is unique in following actual changes and life events of the characters . <p> Naively , it never occurred to me that there might be any controversy regarding the storyline about Lawrence , a young man who is gay and comes out to the other characters . I do not consider such a storyline to be pro-gay . Rather , it shows awareness that many people are homosexual , and is pro-tolerance . I hope that no amount of pressure from homophobic groups will affect the content of the strip , or its continued appearance in The Chronicle . <p> ERIC M. MONSLER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> A PROPER SCULPTURE <p> Editor  --  Getting back to the more mundane things in our world , if an art object of any kind is to enhance The Embarcadero , it should be something that gives credit to the people most responsible for making it a world famous city and port . <p> This honor belongs to the shipping industry , and foremost in that endeavor would be the longshoremen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longshoremen , something on the order of the Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima comes to mind
