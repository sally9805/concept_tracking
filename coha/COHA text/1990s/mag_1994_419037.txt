IT WAS THE FIRST choir rehearsal of the fall . Since most of us had n't sung for months , the director began with warm-up exercises ( " I Love to Sing " ) and reminded us about posture and open vowels . He pleaded for regular attendance . He sightread a few pieces and then prepared something familiar for the first week . By this time many of us were yawning and checking our watches . The director asked us to try " one more piece . " We sang again . This time we were sitting up straight and smiling . The altos next to me sighed , " Beautiful ! " " Wonderful ! " The music was John Rutter 's " The Lord Bless You and Keep You , " and the choir 's reaction has been shared by singers and listeners across the U.S. For the past ten years , the music of this contemporary English composer has intrigued and inspired thousands of listeners . Rutter 's popularity soared in 1984 when he founded Collegium Records , the company that records and distributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " announced the Hartford Courant , and writer Steve Metcalf quoted an organist who said , " Rutter is Springsteen ! " Although Rutter composes both sacred and secular music , he has been especially claimed and revered by church choirs who are thrilled to have anthems , carols and longer works composed " just for them . " Sales reflect Rutter 's popularity . Stanley Schmidt of Collegium Records reports a 9 percent sales increase from 1991 to 1992 , and with the addition of a new Christmas recording , an increase of 35.2 percent  --  125,000 CDs sold  --  from 1992 to 1993 . The man who prompts the " oohs " and " ahs " began his musical career as a choirboy at Highgate School in London . The high point of the choir year there was the Festival of Lessons and Carols at Christmas  --  and one can still detect the influence of this experience in his compositions . In an interview he spoke of his " immense fondness for a choral tradition that goes back centuries . Many of our collegiate institutions and cathedrals have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow up in this culture we absorb that tradition into the heart of our being . " When Rutter first began composing at Clare College in Cambridge he wrote Christmas carols . He showed them to Sir David Willcocks , who was impressed with his work and helped him publish " The Shepherd 's Pipe Carol . " That started a composing-arranging relationship that continues today ( their carols and arrangements are widely used in Christmas concerts ) . Rutter became director of music at Clare College in 1975 , but left to concentrate on composing . He missed working with a choir , however , and in 1981 he established the renowned 28-member Cambridge Singers . The group has recorded over 20 albums and sings in cities around the world . Some of the recordings include Rutter 's compositions ; others feature works by composers such as Byrd , Faure , Poulenc , Bach and Brahms . Rutter comments that " composing is my deepest passion , my compulsion , but at the same time if I spend a whole month without hearing or making some form of live music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cambridge Singers he can have control over early performances of his own works . " A composer is possessive of his newly composed pieces and wants to hear them performed right , " he admitted . Although Rutter was a boy treble , the Singers include no boys . Rutter achieves the pure tone of the English choir tradition with female voices . " They can bring the emotional experience and sensibility of an adult to bear on the music they 're singing , " he told Gramophone magazine . Rutter the guest conductor is almost as popular as Rutter the composer . He fills his schedule with appearances at Carnegie Hall , where he conducts works by Puccini , Elgar , Vaughan Williams and others . One 1995 program , " A Salute to America , " will include selections from Gershwin 's Porgy and Bess as well as American spirituals and folk songs . Other Carnegie Hall programs feature Rutter conducting his own compositions . On May 14 he will conduct his Magnificat , and on May 29 his Requiem , Psalmfest and The Sprig of Thyme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 in a debut at the Kennedy Center in Washington . RUTTER IS ALSO popular as a workshop director , and spends time with high school and college choirs as well as with church choir directors . Workshops often conclude with a performance of a Rutter piece-followed by a standing ovation for Rutter . Collegium 's Schmidt believes that Rutter is at least partially responsible for a choral renaissance . Public television stations have initiated choral programs , and in response to demand for the music a new publishing company offers ten of Rutter 's choral selections ; they are selling in 30 countries . Some who can not afford the music learn it anyway . A chorus from Brazil learned the entire 17-minute Gloria without music , then performed it under Rutter 's direction at Carnegie Hall . The sales figures and concert schedules suggest that Rutter is indeed something of a star . Musicians appear to have enormous respect for the Cambridge Singers and for Rutter 's skill in shaping this group . Barbara Bruns , organ recitalist and assistant director of the Boston Cecelia Society , says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , she first checks to see if the Carnbridge Singers have recorded it . " They 're superb . " Although many are thrilled with the Singers , some are less enthusiastic about Rutter 's music . In fact , his compositions generate rejection as well as raves . Some respond with distaste : " Treacly sweet . " " He works with a set of gimmicks , resulting in predictable tedium . " " He knows the market and is composing for it . " Perhaps the strongest critique has been voiced by David Mason Greene in a review of Te Deum and Other Church Music in the American Record Guide : " What I hear ... is Religious Pop  --  sweet , vapid formula-tunes , some set to gummily sentimental verses ... polite syncopations ... and vowels are frequently aspirated over two or three unnecessary notes . " Though I recognize the basis of this critique , as a choir member I am thrilled to have a composer write " for us " and bring to the church the excitement of his distinctive talent . Rutter 's music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fend off contemporary pop music and the boom boxes that keep appearing in our sanctuaries . He also offers music that 's accessible to all worshipers  --  including those who are not musically trained and whose musical tastes will not be magically elevated by a forced diet of " high-church " music . Rutter occupies a much-appreciated middle ground . I also have to support the revived interest in choral singing that Rutter seems to have fostered . In an interview in the Christian Science Monitor , Rutter mourned people 's tendency " to become passive consumers of music instead of makers of music . I think this has produced a kind of spiritual wound in people . " If his music generates song and singing , music lovers must celebrate . Music directors who have high aspirations for their choirs may find that Rutter 's music attracts new singers . In exchange for the pleasure of singing Rutter , perhaps these singers can be challenged to try Stravinsky and other more complex music . ( See the accompanying article by Paul Westermeyer . ) But few of us are asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Michael Spangler , a pastor and musician in Lake Havasu City , Arizona , says it 's " wonderful to have Rutter as one of the choices , part of the lineup along with the classics ... and the Gaither-style " praise choruses . " He 's something to look forward to ... He 's like a good court composer . " Jeff Hunt , music director at Baker Memorial Chapel ( United Methodist ) in St. Charles , Illinois , has worked both with Rutter 's music and with Rutter himself . When local music supporters initiated the St. Charles Art and Music Festival in 1991 , Hunt sought a guest conductor who would conduct the Mostly Madrigal Singers , the professional chamber choir that Hunt directs . He thought of Rutter right away . " He wanted to do the Mozart Requiem that first year , " Hunt recalls . " It was great . At the first rehearsal , his attitude was " Let 's get into the music , " and he hit it off well with my singers . He is energetic , exciting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in music that helps the musician , gives him or her a new attitude toward it . He meets the needs of the singer , of the listener , and produces the music well , with sensitivity . " More than 1,000 attended the festival . In 1993 Rutter returned to share the stage with Pinchas Zucherman ; the 1995 concert will feature Frederica van Stade  --  and Rutter . This time he may conduct one of his own compositions . " I perform with few amateur groups now , " Rutter said , " but Jeff Hunt 's group is an exception  --  these musicians have the joy of amateurs and the standards and attitudes of professionals . " Hunt finds Rutter 's music inspiring . " In 100 years , " Hunt predicts , " Rutter will still be considered an important church composer . " But which pieces will endure ? Spangler says that he appreciates Te Deum , especially " the way Rutter can spin out single melodies and intertwining melodies virtually forever . " But he added , " Eventually I get a little tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I choose Bach or Pachelbel , something with a foundation , a more symmetrical structure . " Some of Rutter 's longer pieces were commissioned for a cathedral or " grand " setting , and I have had to settle for a living-room performance by way of the CD . Perhaps that setting is too confining for Rutter 's Gloria or The Falcon . Spiraling trumpets and percussive heraldry build an urgent anticipation into the beginning of these works which makes these opening sections hard acts to follow . And yet they are followed  --  by more brass punctuation and more voices building to more climaxes . Rutter 's impressionistic dissonance is sometimes appealing , sometimes excessive . Finally , it 's too ethereal  --  melting away until nothing 's left and one does n't remember much of it . Perhaps it 's the accompaniment that 's overwhelming : some of the pieces were written for organ or piano , then later arranged with orchestral accompaniment which sounds too lush , too distracting . My favorites are Rutter 's shorter pieces . In some of the hymns and carols , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ungrounded melodies . I pay more attention if I know that the soaring , interwoven voices are not going to drift upward indefinitely . Last Christmas I sang in a concert based on Rutter and Willcocks 's 100 Carols for Choirs . The collection includes carols by Britten and Tchaikovsky , new arrangements of familiar carols , and Rutter 's own compositions . The audience that came may not have been the same one that would have come to hear a three-hour St. Matthew 's Passion or Rachmaninoff 's Vespers , but it did fill the sanctuary . We filed in from two sides singing " Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence . " Once in place we begin a favorite , Rutter 's " What Sweeter Music , " which uses a text from Robert Herrick . Rutter 's setting presents the poem without overwhelming it . We sing of a Nativity miracle . Like an unexpected springtime , this birth " warms " a deep icy northern " December into May . " At intermission , a singer suggested that " we should sing this one twice " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 75 , were moved to tears . Perhaps the popularity of Rutter 's Christmas music reflects not only his penchant for English cathedral performances but also the fact that his style is well suited to Christmas sentiments . At Christmas we delight in music that winds and climbs and that transports us . Rutter plays well when our emotions are already heightened , perhaps less well when we are mired in late January . Eve Richardson says in The American Organist that Rutter 's compositions have " warmth , humanity and , to some extent , vulnerability , which account in part for their popularity . If the occasional critic complains that Rutter 's music is " too popular , " it may well be because it is almost unfailingly affirmative . " Rutter has a gift for joining text and music . He admits that this is his goal . " I do not want to work against a text  --  if it contains germs of faith and vision , it is my job to enter into that text , to serve and illuminate that text and bring out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymn lyrics with new vigor , including " Be Thou My Vision " and " God Be in My Head , " and he has introduced relatively unfamiliar texts to audiences by welding them to melodies , including excerpts from the Book of Common Prayer ( 1928 ) , Latin texts from the Ordinary of the Mass and a 16th-century hymn ( " Open Thou Mine Eyes " ) . At another choir rehearsal , the director has stumped us by asking us to choose a favorite anthem for Laity Sunday . I hear myself suggesting Rutter 's setting of " For the Beauty of the Earth . " It 's true that at one point the accompaniment drifts into a comfortable " cha-cha-cha . " And there is an octave jump echoing one line that seems silly . But the overall result is a fresh , childlike , festive hymn of praise . I 've sung the original tune to this hymn for over 40 years , until singing it has become a reflex action and the hymn of praise a deadly drone . Yet I respect the simple but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the love that over and around us lies ... " Rutter takes these words and revives them with a melody that 's immediately appealing . The new melody startles me , and makes me aware of my commitment to the words . The result is an expression of thanks available to both the lethargic long-term choir member and the young or unchurched listener . A new composer attracting new listeners  --  this is no small event , especially when the listeners are people who never heard of Herrick , or who are unchurched , or who tired long ago of church music , or who have sung the 1838 melody to " For the Beauty of the Earth " once too often . If these people are hearing and singing Rutter 's music , they may also encounter the faith to which the music points . For this , churches must be grateful . IN PREPARING for a concert with a college-community choir , another conductor and I chose two works : John Rutter 's Requiem and Igor Stravinsky 's Symphony of Psalms . When we began rehearsals , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sounds were immediately accessible and attractive . The choir as a whole responded to the piece with approval , and the singers thanked me for selecting it . Stravinsky 's piece , however , was regarded as a very strange and formidable composition . It seemed foreign , and hard to understand . Some people wondered if my colleague and I had made a mistake in choosing it . But as rehearsals progressed , the responses changed . The Rutter piece began to lose some of its appeal , while the Stravinsky became more and more interesting . One of the choir members who had at first wondered if I had lost my mind in choosing Stravinsky later wrote to thank me for introducing her to that piece . This experience suggests not only the difficulty of judging the merits of musical compositions , but that one can distinguish choral music that is immediately appealing from that which is of enduring quality  --  and the two categories may not always coincide . One might make another contrast : there is a difference between music which is transparent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The music of J. S. Bach , for example , or folk music or chant does not seek to authenticate a text but assumes the text to be true and allows the text to stand for what it is . By contrast , the music used in advertisements seeks to make a text appealing . It assumes that the texts are more or less false and tries to make the deception attractive . Music , in this case , is a selling device . Could we say that Rutter 's music fits more in the category of advertising ? Is his music the sort that sells something by immediate appeal and that interferes with or obscures the text rather than allowing the text to stand on its own merits ? This is not a trivial question . It has to do not only with truth but with how truth is to be expressed . For Christians it gets at the heart of what proclamation is about , whether the end justifies the means , and whether manipulating people with music ( or anything else ) is acceptable . Can one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's choice of music  --  for a concert or for worship  --  simply a matter of personal preference which admits no discussion ? One can make some judgments . For example , it is clear that some music does not wear well . Communities simply drop some music when it loses its appeal . Much of the music that was sung in churches during the 1960s and 1970s is of that sort . Most " popular " music fits the same category , and so does much " classical " music . The church musician 's vocation is in part precisely to make musical choices that win serve communities well , that will treat them graciously and respectfully and provide music that is worth their time and effort . With reference to Rutter , therefore , here are some judgments : 1 ) Rutter chooses good texts . The words of the Psalms , the Requiem , the Gloria , the Sarum Primer and Robert Herrick have a good track record among Christians . If texts are any indication , Rutter 's music is not in the business of selling falsehoods. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of organ and church music at St. Olaf College , has commented about how adept Rutter is at imitating others and how well he understands the process of composing . He can spin out and develop a musical idea with great ease and facility . 3 ) There is an absence of musical muscle in Rutter in the sense that his music does not have a weighty musical argument . Rutter surely can develop musical ideas with persuasive and careful craft , but he tends to set his texts in sweet musical envelopes . He does not use dissonance in an icy or angular 20th-century way . His dissonance is gentle and never really disturbs the calm of the pretty picture . The dissonance at the beginning of his Requiem , instead of feeling like dissonance , has the effect of quiet and dark murkiness that leads to the clarity yet subtle instability of light . Rutter 's facility and sweetness can give the impression not only of superficiality but of insularity . It can appear to avoid the hard word of the gospel and the dissonance of our society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saccharine bubble around us which insulates us from the gospel itself and from the world the gospel addresses and into which we are called . But that is not only Rutter 's problem . It is one of the central problems that church music faces in our age . Church music that is all sweet and therefore finally dishonest is the rage because it manages to wall out the problems we face . On the other hand , the gospel does offer comfort and sweetness , and it must be said that Rutter presents the attractiveness of the gospel in a far better and more craftsmanlike way than much of the music around us . In the end I would say that Rutter represents the popular side of romanticism , which tends toward the sweet and superficial  --  rather like Norman Rockwell in pictorial art . Rutter and Rockwell leave out the brokenness of life . Hence , they need to be used in conjunction with the steely reality of Picasso and Stravinsky . <p>                @ @ @ @ @
