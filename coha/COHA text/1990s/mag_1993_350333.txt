As an astronaut for the past 26 years , Dr. Story Musgrave has learned to handle pressure and danger . He knows what it 's like to sit atop a 4.5 million- lb. space shuttle as its three main engines roar to life . He remembers well that when the eight steel bolts that attach the rocket boosters to the launching pad are blown away , there 's no turning back . He has felt the crushing sensation as 6 million lbs . of thrust hurl him into orbit . And he knows how sublime and scary it is to float freely in space , tethered to the ship by only a slender lifeline . But none of Musgrave 's four missions have fully prepared him for the challenge he faces next week , when he and six other astronauts are scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral on the shuttle Endeavour . " This thing is frightening to me , " he admits . <P> " This thing " is the most difficult and daring space assignment since the Apollo moon landings . Though NASA is trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the goal is anything but routine : the crew is supposed to fix the faulty Hubble Space Telescope , a $1.6 billion disappointment that has kept astronomers in anguish since it was launched three years ago . The repair work will require that alternating pairs of astronauts go on five space walks of six hours each , which would break the NASA record of four such excursions on a mission . Since the task will be something like weaving baskets while wearing boxing gloves in a weightless environment , success is far from assured . <P> But the mission is more than a risky effort to bring an ailing telescope back to health . It 's a chance  --  maybe the last good chance  --  to revitalize NASA 's faltering image , which has suffered one blow after another since the Challenger explosion in 1986 . Just in the past year , the beleaguered space agency has lost contact with the $1 billion Mars Observer , has had a shuttle launch aborted three seconds before lift-off and has run into serious trouble developing the GOES-Next weather satellite , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $1.7 billion , double the original estimate . <P> Even the Hubble repair mission has already had glitches . Last week ground technicians discovered a faulty sensor in a control device on Endeavour 's right wing . After mulling over the problem for a day , NASA officials decided not to delay the mission , because three other backup sensors could do the job of the malfunctioning one . Of course , given the shuttle 's recent record , a Dec. 1 launch is not exactly a safe bet . <P> The White House and Congress are fed up with giving NASA a blank check for cost overruns and failed missions . Two years ago , the agency asked for a five- year budget of $106 billion , but the Bush Administration chopped it to $96 billion , and Clinton 's budget cutters have set a target of $71 billion for the same period . The President has decreed that Space Station Freedom will be built only if NASA teams up with its old space-race rivals , the Russians , to develop a joint project that minimizes costs .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
