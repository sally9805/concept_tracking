<p> FOR MUSIC FANS , POP-TREND watchers and record-industry observers , the next year is going to be an exciting time . In an opportunity that comes along only twice in a decade , musicians and record labels have a chance to turn one of the most fertile and creative pockets of the underground into that nebulous pop phenomenon known as the next big thing  --  a tag that has been attached to styles as varied as alternative-rock and disco . On the other hand , they could just as easily create **33;468;TOOLONG , or the next joke . <p> Either way , the music will affect in some degree not just what you hear on the radio and see in record stores , and not just the way some of your favorite artists ( and some you 've never heard of before ) make their music ; it will also reach into the worlds of advertising , fashion , art , film , dance , theater , computer programming , night life and design . After all , everyone wants to be ahead of the next curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where there are hundreds of forking paths . <p> The music in question goes by many names and encompasses many genres : techno , electronica , drum-and-bass , jungle , breakbeat , ambient , trip-hop , rave , trance , hardcore . Call it whatever you like , but it is a progressive form of dance-based music made mostly with electronic instruments . It is also an obvious candidate for next big thing because , in a downbeat music industry grasping at straws , electronica is just about the most exhilarating current in music right now . It sounds new . It sounds good . It offers as many different styles as pop itself ( from easy listening to world music to extreme noise ) . And a few of its innovative acts are beginning to bubble up into the mainstream . <p> But the music has been around since the mid-to-late 80 's . So why is the American music industry suddenly interested in it now ? <p> Actually , in 1991 , when rave parties came to America from England , the major record labels made a halfhearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , they signed the leading dance bands ( Altern 8 , Utah Saints , Messiah , Fierce Ruling Diva , Lords of Acid , Quadrophonia , L.A. Style , T99 ) and cranked out formulaic compilations of popular singles with titles like " Rave Til Dawn " and " This Is Techno , " claiming that they would be " Saturday Night Fever " soundtracks for the 90 's . Nothing of any importance resulted , in large part because the music industry did n't believe that anyone would listen to the music beyond the dance floor . Labels were simply collecting bands like junk bonds and hoping they would mature on their own , instead of working with them to nurture and develop an audience . <p> But now the time seems right for electronica  --  not because the music has grown and matured to produce scores of innovative artists who make music as suitable for the home as for the clubs ( which it has ) , but because fans and executives alike are bored with most everything else . The great alternative-rock gold rush is over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former alternative-rock obsessives are collecting obscure , small-label English dance acts with the same self-pride and elitism they once attached to low-fidelity , independent-label rock bands . And more and more , hip-hop and house clubgoers are taking a chance on electronica for a night out . <p> Despite the overwhelming evidence of electronica 's potential , it has taken the initiative of MTV to alert the slow-reacting record industry that there may be a new genre on the horizon . Perhaps less out of a belief in the music than out of an eagerness to be the first to lay claim to the next big thing , MTV has been giving electronica bands like the Prodigy , Underworld and the Chemical Brothers heavy play since the fall . And modern rock stations are gingerly experimenting with electronic music . Soon , some ambitious radio consultant is going come up with a new format with a clinical title like electronic beat music ( E.B.M. ) , which will spin off into adult E.B.M. , contemporary hit radio E.B.M. and modern E.B.M. <p> It would all be exciting if the music industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old formulas to new music . Instead of learning a lesson from the ennui in the marketplace , caused in large part by the glut of sound-alike alternative-rock and bedroom rhythm-and-blues bands , the music industry is gearing up to do the same thing to electronica : throw a bunch of bands at the wall and see which one sticks . All it takes is one new Nirvana or one new Pearl Jam for a company to be considered successful , despite the scores of Sweetwaters and other Seattle bands that did n't make it . <p> Electronic dance music , although a pop phenomenon in countries like England and Germany , also presents the American record industry with new problems . It is not based in rock , rhythm-and-blues or hip-hop , styles that the music business is used to dealing with and marketing . Its antecedents are a combination of progressive German rock from the 70 's , particularly Kraftwerk , and dance-club culture , particularly the disk jockeys and limited-edition singles of house music . In addition , most electronica is instrumental , which has never really been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surf music had its moment . Most of electronica 's creators prefer to remain hidden behind aliases and are unable to recreate their studio music live . Record labels continue to believe that pop audiences need singers , lyrics , personalities , narratives and stories , though exceptions like Enigma and Deep Forest have slipped through the cracks as hip variants of New Age . <p> The president of a major record company recently told its artists and repertory staff ( which signs bands to recording contracts ) to look for electronic dance acts that have an image and vocals and are willing to tour and make videos . In other words , they want an electronic act that works and thinks like a rock band . And , since the business is mostly run by middle-aged men who do n't go to clubs , record labels are most likely going to market these acts like rock bands to a rock audience , despite electronica 's connection to mainstream dance-pop and despite the potential to build on the underground club-going audience the music has been developing on its own for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes on bands like the Prodigy , the Chemical Brothers and Underworld  --  all of which have already toured America 's rock clubs and delivered performances that ranged from good to great and all of which have at least a few songs with vocals . The Prodigy was even dropped by its American label , Elektra , in 1994 and ignored by every other major American label under the assumption that electronica had no future , despite the fact that the Prodigy had a No. 1 album in England . But once the band became an MTV favorite , it was suddenly the object of a major-label bidding war ( that included Elektra ) , finally signing with Madonna 's Maverick Records for several million dollars . ( By comparison , most techno bands were signed for between $10,000 and $80,000 until this deal . ) <p> AND THE PRODIGY IS N'T THE only one . Island is working with the drum-and-bass act Springheel Jack ; Geffen just signed the electronica group Young American Primitive and the bluesy techno act Alabama 3 ; the poppy trip-hop act Moloko and is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transglobal Underground . In addition , major record companies have already started buying into independent dance labels . Dance-music aficionados may notice that most of the acts that record companies are banking on are English . One thing to look for in the next year is American electronica acts popping out of the woodwork in search of record deals . <p> A likely scenario is that when new bands are signed to major labels , they will be asked to include pop singles  --  songs with a catchy vocal chorus  --  on their next album . The elements that made the music different from the pop that everyone was bored with in the first place will be undermined , and what will end up on the music charts will simply sound like new wave ( another former next big thing ) with newer technology . A similar de-evolution happened to alternative rock , most of which has backslid into a 70 's hard-rock revival . Though pop phenomena sometimes happen on their own because of the music and not the manipulation of the record industry , it 's too late for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have to make it happen . <p> Of course , record executive are n't the only ones who like to hop on a bandwagon . Rock stars must often operate like artists and repertory executives to avoid becoming nostalgia acts , latching onto whatever seems cutting-edge and incorporating it into their own music . Like vampires sucking fresh ideas to insure their immortality , U2 , David Bowie and even Nine Inch Nails have new singles that all owe a large debt to techno or drum-and-bass . Such forays by superstars into electronica may help condition audiences to accept these styles as pop . But these musicians may also be stealing the spotlight from the real innovators . <p> The problem is that our culture has fetishized the new to such an extent that it embraces innovations as trends , consuming and then discarding them before they have had time to reach maturity ( look at the virtual reality buzz of 1990 , for example ) . Unfortunately , cycles of human creativity have n't caught up with our appetite for the new , and trash and treasures are embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure . The coming year will determine whether it will stay that way , lose its luster or , more likely , get melted down into something different . <p> Innovative electronica bands that are beginning to enter the mainstream include , above , the Prodigy ( from left , Liam Howlett Keith Flint , Leeroy Thornhill and Maxim Reality ) , the Chemical Brothers , right ( Tom Rowlands , left , and Ed Simons ) , and Springheel Jack ( Ashley Wales , left , and John Coxon ) .
