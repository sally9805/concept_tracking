At this prison the doors are inches thick , steel ; once factory smooth , they now carry multiple dents . Imprints of human faces , knees , elbows , teeth , residue of blood are harvested large on their gray surface . Prison hieroglyphics : pain , fear , death , all permanently recorded here , at least until a new slab of metal arrives . The doors have a square opening at eye level . The guards stare through it , use the small space to throw bright lights at the human cattle on their watch . Without warning , batons smack against the metal with the pop of gun reports . The oldies bear it well , looking down at the floor , studying nothing  --  meaning their lives  --  in a subtle act of defiance , not that anyone notices or cares . The rookies still tense when the pop or light comes ; some dribble pee down their cotton pants , watch it flow over their black low-quarter shoes . They soon get over it , smack the damn door back , fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they want to survive . At night , the prison cells hold the darkness of a cave but for odd shapes here and there . On this night a thunderstorm grips the area . When a lightning bolt dips from the sky , it splashes illumination into the cells through the small Plexiglas windows . The honeycomb pattern of the chicken wire stretched tight across the glass is reproduced on the opposite wall with each burst . During the passage of such light , the man 's face emerges from the dark , as though having suddenly parted the surface of water . Unlike those in the other cells , he sits alone , thinks alone , sees no one in here . The other prisoners fear him ; the guards too , even armed as they are , for he is a man of intimidating proportions . When he passes by the other cons , hardened , violent men in their own right , they quickly look away . His name is Rufus Harms and his reputation at Fort Jackson Military Prison is that of a destroyer : He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never takes the first step , but he will the last . Twenty-five years of incarceration have taken a considerable toll on the man . Like the age rings of a tree , the ruts of scars on Harms 's skin , the poorly healed fractures of bone on his skeleton are a chronicle of his time here . However , far worse damage lies within the soft tissue of his brain , within the centers of his humanity : memory , thought , love , hate , fear , all tainted , all turned against him . But mostly memory , a humbling tumor of iron against the tip of his spine . There is substantial strength left in the massive frame , though ; it is evident in the long , knotty arms , the density of Harms 's shoulders . Even the wide girth of his middle carries the promise of exceptional power . But Harms is still a listing oak , topped out on growth , some limbs dead or dying , beyond the cure of pruning , the roots ripped out on one side . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others , faithful to his God , irreversibly cast in the image of a heartless killer . Because of this the guards and the other prisoners leave him be . And he is content with that . Until this day . What his brother has brought him . A package of gold , a surge of hope . A way out of this place . Another burst of light shows his eyes brimming with deep red , as though bloodied , until one sees the tears that stain his dark , heavy face . As the light recedes , he smooths out the piece of paper , taking care not to make any sound , an invitation to the guards to come sniffing . Lights have been extinguished for several hours now , and he is unable to reverse that . As it has been for a quarter century , his darkness will end only with the dawn . The absence of light matters little , though . Harms has already read the letter , absorbed every word . Each syllable cuts him like the quick bite of a shiv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top of the paper . He knows the symbol well . The Army has been his employer , his warden for almost thirty years . The Army was requesting information from Rufus Harms , a failed and forgotten private from the era of Vietnam . Detailed information . Information Harms had no way of giving . His finger navigating true even without light , Harms touched the place in the letter that had first aroused fragments of memory drifting within him all these years . These particles had generated the incapacitation of endless nightmare , but the nucleus had seemed forever beyond him . Upon first reading the letter , Harms had dipped his head low to the paper , as though trying to reveal to himself the hidden meanings in the typewritten squiggles , to solve the greatest mystery of his mortal life . Tonight , those twisted fragments had suddenly coalesced into firm recollection , into the truth . Finally . Until he read the letter from the Army , Harms had only two distinct memories of that night twenty-five years ago : the little girl ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much like tonight . The girl 's features were delicate ; the nose only a bud of cartilage ; the face as yet unlined by sun , age or worry ; her staring eyes blue and innocent , the ambitions of a long life ahead still forming within their simple depths . Her skin was the white of sugar , and unblemished except for the red marks crushed upon a neck as fragile as a flower stem . The marks had been caused by the hands of Private Rufus Harms , the same hands that now clutched the letter as his mind careened dangerously close to that image once more . Whenever he thought of the dead girl he wept , had to , could n't help it , but he did so silently , with good reason . The guards and cons were buzzards , sharks , they sniffed blood , weakness , an opening , from a million miles away ; they saw it in the twitch of your eyes , the widened pores of your skin , even in the stink of your sweat . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tough , nimble equaled life . Or not . He was kneeling beside her when the MPs found them . Her thin dress clung to her diminutive frame , which had receded into the saturated earth , as though she had been dropped from a great height to form the shallowest of graves . Harms had looked up at the MPs once , but his mind had registered nothing more than a confusion of darkened silhouettes . He had never felt such fury in his life , even as the nausea seized him , his eyes losing their focus , his pulse rate , respiration , blood pressure all bottoming out . He had gripped his head as if to prevent his bursting brain from cleaving through the bone of his skull , through tissue and hair , and exploding into the soaked air . When he had looked down once more at the dead girl , and then at the pair of twitching hands that had ended her life , the anger had drained from him , as though someone had jerked free a plug embedded within . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only remain kneeling , wet and shivering , his knees sunk deeply into the mud . A black high chieftain in green fatigues presiding over a small pale-skinned sacrifice , was how one stunned witness would later describe it . The next day he would come to learn the little girl 's name : Ruth Ann Mosley , ten years old , from Columbia , South Carolina . She and her family had been visiting her brother , who was stationed at the base . On that night Harms had only known Ruth Ann Mosley as a corpse , small  --  tiny , in fact  --  compared to the stunning breadth of his six-foot-five-inch , three-hundred-pound body . The blurred image of the rifle butt that one of the MPs smashed against his skull represented the last mental sliver Harms carried from that night . The blow had dropped him to the ground right next to her . The girl 's lifeless face pointed upward , collecting droplets of rain in every still crevice . His face sunken into the mud , Rufus Harms saw nothing more . Remembered nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and stared out the half-open window . He was suddenly that still rare beast : an innocent man in prison . He had convinced himself over the years that such evil had been lurking , cancerlike , within him . He had even thought of suicide , to make penance for stealing the life of another , more pitiably a child 's . But he was deeply religious , and not a fleeting jailhouse convert to the Lord . He thus could not commit the sin of prematurely forcing his last breath . He also knew the girl 's killing had condemned him to an afterlife a thousand times worse than the one he was now enduring . He was unwilling to rush to its embrace . Better this place , this man-made prison , for now . Now he understood that his decision to live had been right . God had known , had kept him alive for this moment . With stunning clarity he recalled the men who had come for him that night at the stockade . His mind once more clearly held every contorted face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his comrades in arms . He recalled the way they circled him , wolves to prey , emboldened only by their numbers ; the telling hatred of their words . What they had done that night had caused Ruth Ann Mosley to die . And in a very real sense , Harms had died as well . To these men Harms was an able-bodied soldier who had never fought in defense of his country . Whatever he got , he deserved , they no doubt believed . Now he was a middle-aged man slowly dying in a cage as punishment for a crime of long-ago origin . He had no power to see that any semblance of justice was done on his behalf . And yet with all that , Rufus Harms stared into the familiar darkness of his crypt , a single passion empowering him : After twenty-five years of terrible , wrenching guilt that had relentlessly taunted him until he was just barely in possession of a ruined life , he knew that it was now their turn to suffer . He gripped the worn Bible his mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had chosen never to abandon him .
