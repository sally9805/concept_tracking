She wondered how many times a week he had to do this . Plenty , no doubt . At least every day . Maybe twice ... three times . Maybe , on a big day , five times . It was the ultimate bad news , and he delivered it dryly , like Sergeant Joe Friday . He was a young man , but his was a tough business and he had gone freeze-dried already . Hey , the bad news was n't really a surprise ! She ... knew . Of course , you always hope for the best . She heard but she did n't hear . <p> " What ? " she offered timidly . She had hoped ... for better . Geez ! Give me a break ! What was he saying ? Breast and uterus ? Double trouble ! She knew it would be the uterus . There had been the discharge . The bloating , the cramps . The fatigue . But it was common and easily curable provided you got it at stage one . Eighty percent cure . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be really tricky  --  that was fifty-fifty . Strip out the lymph nodes down your arm and guaranteed chemo . God ! Chemo . The worst thing in the world . Good-bye hair  --  there 'd be scarves , wigs , a prosthetic breast , crying your heart out in " support " groups . Et cetera . <p> " Mrs. Wilson ? " The voice seemed to come out of a can . Now the truth was revealed and all was out in the open . Yet how  --  tell me this  --  how would it ever be possible to have a life again ? The voice from the can had chilled her . To the core . <p> " Mrs. Wilson , your last CA 125 hit the ceiling , " he said . " I suspect that this could be an irregular kind of can ... cer . " <p> Some off-the-wall kind of can ... cer ? A kind of wildfire cancer ! Not the easygoing , 80 percent cure , tortoise , **30;27;TOOLONG cancer ! <p> January . She looked past the thin oncologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snowflakes tumbled from the sky , kissing the pavement  --  each unique , wonderful , worth an hour of study , a microcosm of the Whole : awe-inspiring , absolutely fascinating , a gift of divinity gratis . Yet how abhorrent they seemed . They were white , but the whole world had lost its color for her now that she 'd heard those words . The shine was gone from the world . Had she been Queen of the Universe for a million years and witnessed glory after glory , what would it have mattered now that she had come to this ? <p> She ... came to ... went out , came back again ... went out . There was this ... wonderful show . Cartoons . It was the best show . This was n't so bad . True , she had cancer but ... these wonderful cartoons . Dilaudid . On Dilaudid , well , you live , you die  --  that 's how it is ... life in the Big City . It happens to everyone . It 's part of the plan . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad part was her throat .

Who invented that drug ? Write him a letter . Knight him . Award the Nobel Prize to Dilaudid Man . Where was that knob ? A handy thing to know . Whew ! Whammo ! Swirling , throbbing ecstasy ! And who was that nurse ? Florence Nightingale , Mother Teresa would be proud ... oh , boy ! It was n't just relief from the surgery ; she suddenly realized how much psychic pain she had been carrying and now it was gone with one swoop of a magic wand . The cartoons . Bliss ... <p> His voice was n't in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , maybe a little high for a man . Not that he was effeminate . The whole problem with him was that he did n't seem real . He was n't a flesh-and-blood kinda guy . Where was the empathy ? Why did he get into this field if he could n't empathize ? In this field , empathy should be your stock-in-trade . <p> " The breast is fine , just a benign lump . We brought a specialist in to get it , and I just reviewed the pathology report . It 's nothing to worry about . The other part is not ... so good . I 'm afraid your abdomen ... it 's spread throughout your abdomen ... it looks like little Grape-Nuts , actually . It 's exceedingly rare and it 's ... it 's a rapid form of ... can ... cer . We could n't really take any of it out . I spent most of my time in there untangling adhesions . We 're going to have to give you cisplatin ... if it were n't for the adhesions , we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get so sick that way  --  but those adhesions are a problem and may cause problems further along . " Her room was freezing , but the thin oncologist was beginning to perspire . " It 's a shame , " he said , looking down at her chart . " You 're in such perfect health ... otherwise . " <p> She knew this was going to happen yet she heard herself say , " Doctor , do you mean ... I 've got to take  --  " <p> " Chemo ? Yeah . But do n't worry about that yet . Let 's just let you heal up for a while . " He slammed her chart shut and ... whiz , bang , he was outta there . <p> Good-bye , see ya . <p> The guessing game was over and now it was time for the ordeal . She did n't want to hear any more details  --  he 'd said something about a 20 percent five-year survival rate . Might as well bag it . She was n't a fighter , and she 'd seen what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it . Finis ! <p> She had to laugh . Got giddy . It was like in that song  --  Freedom 's just another word for nothing left to lose ... When you 're totally screwed , nothing can get worse , so what 's to worry ? Of course she could get lucky ... it would be a thousand-to-one , but maybe ... <p> The ovaries and uterus were gone . The root of it all was out . Thank God for that . Those befouled organs were gone . Where ? Disposed of . Burned . In a dumpster ? Who cares ? The source was destroyed . Maybe it would n't be so bad . How could it be that bad ? After all , the talk about pain from major abdominal surgery was overdone . She was walking with her little cart and tubes by the third day  --  a daily constitutional through the ward . <p> Okay , the Dilaudid was permanently off the menu , but morphine sulfate was n't half bad . No more cartoons but rather a mellow glow . Left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three , four ! Even a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step . On the morphine she was walking a quarter of an inch off the ground and everything was ... softer , mercifully so . Maybe she could hack it for a thousand miles . <p> But those people in the hospital rooms , gray and dying , that was her . Could such a thing be possible ? To die ? Really ? Yes , at some point she guessed you did die . But her ? Now ? So soon ? With so little time to get used to the idea ? <p> No , this was all a bad dream ! She 'd wake up . She 'd wake up back in her little girl room on the farm near Battle Lake , Minnesota . There was a Depression , things were a little rough , but big deal . What could beat a sun-kissed morning on Battle Lake and a robin 's song ? There was an abundance of jays , larks , bluebirds , cardinals , hummingbirds , red-winged blackbirds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came to her yard to eat from the cherry , apple , plum , and pear trees . What they really went for were the mulberries . <p> Ah , youth ! Good looks , a clean complexion , muscle tone , a full head of lustrous hair  --  her best feature , although her legs were pretty good , too . Strength . Vitality . A happy kid with a bright future . Cheerleader her senior year . Pharmacy scholarship at the college in Fergus Falls . Geez , if her dad had n't died , she could have been a pharmacist . Her grades were good , but hard-luck stories were the order of the day . It was a Great Depression . She would have to take her chances . Gosh ! It had been a great , wide , wonderful world in those days , and no matter what , an adventure lay ahead , something marvelous  --  a handsome prince and a life happily ever after . Luck was with her . Where had all the time gone ? How had all the dreams ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shadow . The morphine sulfate was like a warm and friendly hearth in Gloom City , her one and only consolation . <p> He was supposed to be a good doctor , one of the best in the field , but he had absolutely no bedside manner . She really began to hate him when he took away the morphine and put her on Tylenol 3 . Then it began to sink in that things might presently go downhill in a hurry . <p> They worked out a routine . If her brother was busy , her daughter drove her up to the clinic and then back down to the office , and the thin oncologist is ... called away , or he 's ... running behind , or he 's ... something . Could n't they run a business , get their shit together ? Why could n't they anticipate ? It was one thing to wait in line at a bank when you 're well , but when you 've got cancer and you 're this cancer patient and you wait an hour , two hours , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back for something that 's worse than anything , the very worst thing in the world ! Hard to get up for that . You really had to brace yourself . Cisplatin , God ! Metal mouth , restlessness , pacing . Flop on the couch , but that 's not good ; get up and pace , but you ca n't handle that , so you flop on the couch again . Get up and pace . Is this really happening to me ? I ca n't believe this is really happening to me ! How can such a thing be possible ? <p> Then there were the episodes of simultaneous diarrhea and vomiting that sprayed the bathroom from floor to ceiling ! Dry heaves and then dry heaves with bile and then dry heaves with blood . You could drink a quart of tequila and then a quart of rum and have some sloe gin too and eat pink birthday cakes and five pounds of licorice , Epsom salts , a pint of kerosene , some Southern Comfort  --  and you 're on a Sunday picnic compared to cisplatin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe get well you first had to poison yourself within a whisker of death , and in fact if you did n't die , you wished that you had . <p> There were visitors in droves . Flowers . Various intrusions at all hours . Go away . Leave me alone ... please , God , leave me ... alone . <p> Oh , hi , thanks for coming . Oh , what a lovely  --  such beautiful flowers ... <p> There were moments when she felt that if she had one more episode of diarrhea , she 'd jump out of the window . Five stories . Would that be high enough ? Or would you lie there for a time and die slowly ? Maybe if you took a header right onto the concrete . Maybe then you would n't feel a thing . Cisplatin : she had to pace . But she had to lie down , but she was squirrelly as hell and she could n't lie down . TV was no good  --  she had double vision , and it was all just a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What absolute crap . Even her old favorites . You only live once , and to think of all the time she pissed away watching soap operas . <p> If only she could sleep . God , could n't they give her Dilaudid ? No ! Wait ! Hold that ! Somehow Dilaudid would make it even worse . Ether then . Put her out . Wake me up in five days . Just let me sleep . She had to get up to pace . She had to lie down . She had to vomit . Oh , hi , thanks for coming . Oh , what a lovely  --  such beautiful flowers . <p> The second treatment made the first treatment seem like a month in the country . The third treatment  --  oh , damn ! The whole scenario had been underplayed . Those movie stars who got it and wrote books about it were stoics , valiant warriors compared to her . She had no idea anything could be so horrible . Starving in Bangladesh ? No problem , I 'll trade . Here 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull a rickshaw , anything ! Anything but this . HIV-positive ? Why just sign right here on the dotted line and you 've got a deal ! I 'll trade with anybody ! Anybody . <p> The thin oncologist with the Bugs Bunny voice said the CA 125 number was still up in the stratosphere . He said it was up to her if she wanted to go on with this . What was holding her up ? She did n't know , and her own voice came from a can now . She heard herself say , " Doctor , what would you do ... if you were me ? " <p> He thought it over for a long time . He pulled off his wire rims and pinched his nose , world-weary . " I 'd take the next treatment . " <p> It was the worst by far  --  square root to infinity . Five days : no sleep , pacing , lying down , pacing . Puke and diarrhea . The phone . She wanted to tear it off the wall . Who invented it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , hi , well ... just fine . Just dandy . Coming by on Sunday ? With the kids ? Well ... no , I feel great . No . No . No . I 'd love to see you ... <p> And then one day the thin-timbre voice delivered good news . " Your CA 125 is almost within normal limits . It 's working ! " <p> Hallelujah ! Oh , my God , let it be so ! A miracle . Hurrah ! <p> " It is a miracle , " he said . He was almost human , Dr. Kildare , Dr. Ben Casey , Marcus Welby , M.D.  --  take your pick . " Your CA is down to rock bottom . I think we should do one , possibly two more treatments and then go back inside for a look . If we do too few , we may not kill it all but if we do too much  --  you see , it 's toxic to your healthy cells as well . You can get cardiomyopathy in one session of cisplatin and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can handle . " <p> " Gotcha , Mrs. Wilson . One more and in for a look . " <p> " I hate to tell you this , " he said . Was he making the cartoons go away ? " I 'll be up front about it , Mrs. Wilson , we 've still got a problem . The little Grape-Nuts  --  fewer than in the beginning , but the remaining cells will be resistant to cisplatin , so our options are running thin . We could try a month of an experimental form of hard chemotherapy right here in the hospital  --  very , very risky stuff . Or we could resume the cisplatin , not so much aiming for a cure but rather as a holding action . Or we could not do anything at all ... " <p> Her voice was flat . She said , " What if I do n't do anything ? " <p> " Dead in three months , maybe six . " <p> She said , " Dead how ? " <p> " Lungs , liver , or bowel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a lot of pain . I 'll see to that . " <p> Bingo ! He flipped the chart shut and ... whiz , bang , he was outta there ! <p> She realized that when she got right down to it , she wanted to live , more than anything , on almost any terms , so she took more cisplatin . But the oncologist was right , it could n't touch those resistant rogue cells ; they were like roaches that could live through atomic warfare , grow and thrive . Well then , screw it ! At least there would n't be pain . What more can you do ? She should n't have let him open her up again . That had been the worst sort of folly . She 'd let him steamroll her with Doctor Knows Best . Air had hit it . No wonder it was a wildfire . A conflagration . <p> Her friends came by . It was an effort to make small talk . How could they know ? How could they know what it was like ? They loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had to get juiced before they could stand to come by ! They came with casseroles and cleaned for her , but she had to sweat out her nights alone . Dark nights of the soul on Tylenol 3 and Xanax . A lot of good that was . But then when she was in her loose , giddy freedom 's just another word for nothing left to lose mood , about ten days after a treatment , she realized her friends were n't so dumb . They knew that they could n't really know . Bugs Bunny told her there was no point in going on with the cisplatin . He told her she was a very brave lady . He said he was sorry . <p> A month after she was off that poison , cisplatin , there was a little side benefit . She could see the colors of the earth again and taste food and smell flowers  --  it was a bittersweet pleasure , to be sure . But her friends took her to Hawaii , where they had this great friend ( " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made a play for her and brought her flowers every day , expensive roses , et cetera . She had never considered another man since John had died from can ... cer ten years before . How wonderful to forget it all for a moment here and there . A moment ? Qualify that  --  make that ten , fifteen seconds . How can you forget it ? Ever since she got the news she could ... not ... forget ... it . <p> Now there were stabbing pains , twinges , flutterings  --  maybe it was normal everyday stuff amplified by the imagination or maybe it was real . How fast would it move , this wildfire brand ? Better not to ask . <p> Suddenly she was horrible again . Those nights alone  --  killers . Finally one night she broke down and called her daughter . Hated to do it , throw in the towel , but this was the fifteenth round and she did n't have a prayer . <p> " Oh , hi . I 'm just fine "  --  blah blah blah  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay , just a while . I 'd like to see Janey and  --  " <p> " We 'll drive up in the morning . " <p> At least she was with blood . And her darling granddaughter . What a delight . Playing with the little girl , she could forget . It was even better than Hawaii . After a year of sheer hell , in which all of the good stuff added up to less than an hour and four minutes total , there was a way to forget . She helped with the dishes . A little light cleaning . Watched the game shows , worked the Times crossword , but the pains grew worse . Goddamn it , it felt like nasty little yellow-tooth rodents or a horde of translucent termites  --  thousands of them , chewing her guts out ! Tylenol 3 could n't touch it . The new doctor she had been passed to gave her Dilaudid . She was enormously relieved . But what she got was a vial of little pink tablets and after the first dose she realized it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by on it but they 'd promised  --  no pain ! She was losing steam . Grinding down . <p> They spent a couple of days on the Oregon coast . The son-in-law  --  somehow it was easy to be with him . He did n't pretend that things were other than they were . He could be a pain in the bun , like everyone , bitching over trivialities , smoking Kool cigarettes , strong ones  --  jolters ! A pack a day easy , although he was considerate enough to go outside and do it . She wanted to tell him , " Fool ! Your health is your greatest fortune ! " But she was the one who 'd let six months pass after that first discharge . <p> The Oregon coast was lovely , although the surf was too cold for actual swimming . She sat in the hotel whirlpool and watched her granddaughter swim a whole length of the pool all on her own , a kind of dog-paddle thing but not bad for a kid going on seven . They saw a show of shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good front and not to be morbid , losing weight big time . After a shower , standing at the mirror , scars zigzagging all over the joint like the Bride of Frankenstein , it was just awful . She was bald , scrawny , ashen , yet with a bloated belly . She could n't look . Sometimes she would sink to the floor and just lie there , too sick to even cry , too weak to even get dressed , yet somehow she did get dressed , slapped on that hot , goddamn wig , and showed up for dinner . It was easier to do that if you pretended that it was n't real , if you pretended it was all on TV . <p> She felt like a naughty little girl sitting before the table looking at meals her daughter was killing herself to make  --  old favorites that now tasted like a combination of forty-weight Texaco oil and sawdust . It was a relief to get back to the couch and work crossword puzzles . It was hell imposing on her daughter but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had to take her . Oh , to come to this ! <p> The son-in-law worked swing shift and he cheered her in the morning when he got up and made coffee . He was full of life . He was real . He was authentic . He even interjected little pockets of hope . Not that he pushed macrobiotics or any of that foolishness , but it was a fact  --  if you were happy , if you had something to live for , if you loved life , you lived . It had been a mistake for her to hole up there in the mountains after John died . The Will to Live was more important than doctors and medicines . You had to reinvigorate the Will to Live . The granddaughter was good for that . She just could n't go the medication-tape route , imagining microscopic , ravenous , good-guy little sharks eating the bad cancer cells , et cetera . At least the son-in-law did n't suggest that or come on strong with a theology trip . She noticed he read the King James Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a milk-shake diet she choked down . Vanilla , chocolate fudge , strawberry  --  your choice . Would Madame like a bottle of wine with dinner ? Ha , ha , ha . <p> Dilaudid . It was n't working , there was serious pain , especially in her chest , dagger thrusts  --  Et tu , Brute ? She watched the clock like a hawk and had her pills out and ready every four hours  --  and that last hour was getting to be murder , a morbid sweat began popping out of her in the last fifteen minutes . One morning she caved in and timidly asked the son-in-law , " Can I take three ? " <p> He said , " Hell , take four . It 's a safe drug . If you have bad pain , take four . " Her eyes were popping out of her head . " Here , drink it with coffee and it will kick in faster . " <p> He was right . He knew more than the doctor . You just ca n't do everything by the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was too compliant , one of those " cancer " personalities . She believed in the rules . She was one of those kind who wanted to leave the world a better place than she found it . She had been a good person , had always done the right thing  --  this just was n't right . It was n't fair . She was so ... angry ! <p> The next day , over the phone , her son-in-law bullied a prescription of methadone from the cancer doctor . She heard one side of a lengthy heated exchange while the son-in-law made a persuasive case for methadone . He came on like Clarence Darrow or F. Lee Bailey . It was a commanding performance . She 'd never heard of anyone giving a doctor hell before . God bless him for not backing down ! On methadone tablets a warm orange glow sprung forth and bloomed like a glorious , time-lapse rose in her abdomen and then rolled through her body in orgasmic waves . The sense of relief shattered all fear and doubt though the pain was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  so what ? And the methadone tablets lasted a very long time  --  no more of that every four hours bullshit . <p> Purple blotches all over her skin , swollen ankles . Pain in her hips and joints . An ambulance trip to the emergency room . " Oh , " they said , " it 's nothing ... vascular purpura . Take aspirin . Who 's next ? " <p> Who 's next ? Why had n't she taken John 's old .38 revolver the very day she heard that voice in the can ? Stuck it in the back of her mouth and pulled the trigger ? She had no fear of hellfire . She was a decent , moral person but she did not believe . Neither was she the Hamlet type  --  what lies on the other side ? It was probably the same thing that occurred before you were born  --  zilch . And zilch was n't that bad . What was wrong with zilch ? <p> One morning she waited overlong for the son-in-law to get up , almost smashed a candy dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep forever ? Actually , he got up at his usual time . <p> " I ca n't . Get . My breath , " she told him . <p> " You probably have water in your lungs , " the son-in-law said . He knew she did n't want to go to the clinic . " We 've got some diuretic . They were Boxer 's when she had congestive heart failure  --  dog medicine , but it 's the same thing they give humans . Boxer weighed fifty-five pounds . Let me see ... take four , no , take three . To be cautious . Do you feel like you have a cough ? " <p> " Yes . " Kaff , kaff , kaff . <p> " This might draw the water out of your lungs . It 's pretty safe . Try to eat a banana or a potato skin to keep your potassium up . If it does n't work , we can go over to the clinic . " <p> How would he know something like that ? But he was right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy but she could breathe . The panic to end all panics was over . If she could only go ... number two . Well , the methadone slows you down . " Try some Metamucil , " the son-in-law said . <p> It worked . Kind of , but it sure was n't anything to write home about . <p> " I ca n't breathe . The diuretics are n't working . " <p> The son-in-law said they could tap her lung . It would mean another drive to the clinic , but the procedure was almost painless and provided instantaneous relief . It worked but it was three days of exhaustion after that one . The waiting room . Why so long ? Why could n't they anticipate ? You did n't have to be a genius to know which way the wildfire was spreading . Would the methadone keep that internal orange glow going or would they run out of ammo ? Was methadone the ultimate or were there bigger guns ? Street heroin ? She 'd have to put on her wig and go out and score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Gramma was n't so much fun anymore ; she just lay there and she gave off this smell . There was no more dressing up ; it was just the bathrobe . In fact , she felt the best in her old red-and-black tartan pattern , flannel , ratty-ass bathrobe , not the good one . The crosswords  --  forget it , too depressing . You could live the life of Cleopatra but if it came down to this , what was the point ? <p> The son-in-law understood . Of all the people to come through . It 's bad and it gets worse and so on until the worst of all . " I do n't know how you can handle this , " he 'd say . " What does it feel like ? Does it feel like a hangover ? Worse than a hangover ? Not like a hangover . Then what ? Like drinking ten pots of boiled coffee ? Like that ? Really ? Jittery ! Oh , God , that must be awful . How can you stand it ? Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other aspect ? Your fingers are numb ? Blurred vision ? It takes eight years to watch the second hand sweep from twelve to one ? Well , if it 's like that , how did you handle five days ? I could n't  --  I 'd take a bottle of pills , shoot myself . Something . What about the second week ? Drained ? Washed out ? Oh , brother ! I had a three-day hangover once  --  I 'd rather die than do that again . I could n't ride out that hangover again for money . I know I could n't handle chemo ... " <p> One afternoon after he left for work , she found a passage circled in his well-worn copy of Schopenhauer : " In early youth , as we contemplate our coming life , we are like children in a theater before the curtain is raised , sitting there in high spirits and eagerly waiting for the play to begin . It is a blessing that we do not know what is really going to happen . " Yeah ! She gave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idea . This Schopenhauer was a genius ! Why had n't anyone told her ? She was a reader , she had waded through some philosophy in her time  --  you just could n't make any sense out of it . The problem was the terminology ! She was a crossword ace , but words like eschatology  --  hey ! Yet Schopenhauer got right into the heart of all the important things . The things that really mattered . With Schopenhauer she could take long excursions from the grim specter of impending death . In Schopenhauer , particularly in his aphorisms and reflections , she found an absolute satisfaction , for Schopenhauer spoke the truth and the rest of the world was disseminating lies ! <p> Her son-in-law helped her with unfinished business : will , mortgage , insurance , how shall we do this , that , and the other ? Cremation , burial plot , et cetera . He told her the stuff that her daughter could n't tell her . He waited for the right moment and then got it all in  --  for instance , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was hard for her to say so . She knew she cringed at this revelation , for it was ditto with her , and she knew that he could see it . Why could n't she say to her own daughter three simple words , " I love you " ? She just could n't . Somehow it was n't possible . The son-in-law did n't judge her . He had to be under pressure , too . Was she bringing everyone in the house down ? Is that why he was reading Schopenhauer ? No , Schopenhauer was his favorite . " Someone had to come out and tell it like it is , " he would say of the dour old man with muttonchops whose picture he had pasted on the refrigerator . From what she picked up from the son-in-law , Schopenhauer wrote his major work by his twenty-sixth birthday  --  a philosophy that was ignored almost entirely in his lifetime and even now , in this day and age , it was thought to be more of a work of art than philosophy in the truest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed irrefutable ! According to the son-in-law , Schopenhauer spent the majority of his life in shabby rooms in the old genteel section of Frankfurt , Germany , that he shared with successions of poodles to keep him company while he read , reflected , and wrote about life at his leisure . He had some kind of small inheritance , just enough to get by , take in the concerts , do a little traveling now and then . He was well versed in several languages . He read virtually everything written from the Greeks on upward , including the Eastern writers , a classical scholar , and had the mind to chew things over and make something of the puzzle of life . The son-in-law , eager to discourse , said Freud called Schopenhauer one of the six greatest men who ever lived . Nietzsche , Thomas Mann , and Richard Wagner all paid tribute to this genius who had been written off with one word  --  pessimist . The son-in-law lamented that his works were going out of print , becoming increasingly harder to find . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a little bust of his hero . He had written to officials in Germany making inquiries . They had given him the brush-off . He 'd have to fly over himself . And she , too , began to worry that the works of this writer would no longer be available ... she , who would be worms ' meat any day . <p> Why ? Because the truth was worthwhile . It was more important than anything , really . She 'd had ten years of peaceful retirement , time to think , wonder , contemplate , and had come up with nothing . But new vistas of thought had been opened by the curiously ignored genius with the white muttonchops , whose books were harder and harder to get and whom the world would consider a mere footnote from the nineteenth century  --  a crank , a guy with an ax to grind , a hypochondriac , a misogynist , an alarmist who slept with pistols under his pillow , a man with many faults . Well , check anyone out and what do you find ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make any sense out of this crazy-ass shit called life ? If only she could simply push a button and never have been born . <p> The son-in-law took antidepressants and claimed to be a melancholiac , yet he always seemed upbeat , comical , ready with a laugh . He had a sense of the absurd that she had found annoying back in the old ways when she liked to pretend that life was a stroll down Primrose Lane . If she was n't walking down the " sunny side of the street " at least she was " singin ' in the rain . " Those were the days . <p> What a fool ! <p> She encouraged the son-in-law to clown and philosophize , and he flourished when she voiced a small dose of appreciation or barked out a laugh . There was more and more pain and discomfort , but she was laughing more too . Schopenhauer : " No rose without a thorn . But many a thorn without a rose . " The son-in-law finessed all of the ugly details that were impossible for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With her lungs temporarily clear and mineral oil enemas to regulate her , she asked her daughter one last favor . Could they take her home just once more ? <p> They made an occasion of it and drove her up into the mountains for her granddaughter 's seventh birthday party . Almost everyone in the picturesque resort town was there , and if they were appalled by her deterioration they did not show it . She could n't go out on the sun porch , had to semi-recline on the couch , but everyone came in to say hello and all of the bad stuff fell away for ... an entire afternoon ! She was deeply touched by the warm affection of her friends . There were ... so many of them . My God ! They loved her , truly they did . She could see it . You could n't bullshit her anymore ; she could see deep into the human heart ; she knew what people were . What wonderful friends . What a perfect afternoon . It was the last ... good thing . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die in earnest . It was in the lungs and the bowel , much as the doctor said it would be . Hell , it was probably in the liver even . She was getting yellow , not just the skin but even the whites of her eyes . There was a week in the hospital , where they tormented her with tests . That wiped out the last of her physical and emotional stamina . <p> She fouled her bed after a barium lower G.I. practically turned to cement and they had to give her a powerful enema . Diarrhea in the bed . The worst humiliation . " Happens all the time , do n't worry , " the orderly said . <p> She was suffocating . She could n't get the least bit of air . All the main players were in the room . She knew this was it ! Just like that . Bingo ! There were whispered conferences outside her room . Suddenly the nurses , those heretofore angels of mercy , began acting mechanically . They could look you over and peg you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them give her that anytime now look . A minister dropped in . There ! That was the tip-off  --  the fat lady was singing . <p> When the son-in-law showed up instead of going to work she looked to him with panic . She 'd been fighting it back but now ... he was there , he would know what to do without being asked , and in a moment he was back with a nurse . They cranked up the morphine sulfate , flipped it on full-bore . Still her back hurt like hell . All that morphine and a backache ... just give it a minute ... ahhh ! Cartoons . <p> Someone went out to get hamburgers at Mcdonald 's . Her daughter sat next to her holding her hand . She felt sorry for them . They were the ones who were going to have to stay behind and play out their appointed roles . Like Schopenhauer said , the best they would be able to do for themselves was to secure a little room as far away from the fire as possible , for Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or was it ? <p> She began to nod . She was holding onto a carton of milk . It would spill . Like diarrhea-in-the-bed all over again . Another mess . The daughter tried to take the carton of milk away . She ... held on defiantly . Forget the Schopenhauer  --  what a lot of crap that was ! She did not want to cross over . She wanted to live ! She wanted to live ! <p> The daughter wrenched the milk away . The nurse came back and cranked up the morphine again . They were going for " comfort . " Finally the backache ... the cartoons ... all of that was gone . <p> ( She was back on the farm in Battle Lake , Minnesota . She was nine years old and she could hear her little red rooster , Mr. Barnes , crowing at first light . Then came her brother 's heavy work boots clomping downstairs and the vacuum swoosh as he opened up the storm door , and then his boots crunch-crunching through the frozen snow . Yes , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making for the outhouse and presently Barnes would go after him , make a dive-bomb attack . You could n't discourage Mr. Barnes . She heard her brother curse him and the thwap of the tin feed pan hitting the bird . Mr. Barnes 's frontal assaults were predictable . From the sound of it , Fred walloped him good . As far as Mr. Barnes was concerned , it was his barnyard . In a moment she heard the outhouse door slam shut and another tin thwap . That Barnes  --  he was something . She should have taken a lesson . Puffed out her chest and walked through life  --  " I want the biggest and the best and the most of whatever you 've got ! " There were people who pulled it off . You really could do it if you had the attitude . <p> Her little red rooster was a mean little scoundrel , but he had a soft spot for her in his heart of steel and he looked out for her , cooed for her and her alone . Later , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet her thereafter at the drugstore soda fountain uptown . One confrontation with Barnes , even for experienced farm boys , was one too many . He was some kind of rooster all right , an eccentric . Yeah , she was back on the farm . She ... could feel her sister shifting awake in the lower bunk . It was time to get up and milk the cows . Her sister always awoke in good humor . Not her . She was cozy under a feather comforter and milking the cows was the last thing she wanted to do . Downstairs she could hear her mother speaking cheerfully to her brother as he came back inside , cursing the damn rooster , threatening to kill it . Her mother laughed it off ; she did n't have a mean bone in her body . <p> She ... could smell bacon in the pan , the coffee pot was percolating , and her grandmother was up heating milk for her Ovaltine . She hated Ovaltine , particularly when her grandmother overheated the milk  --  burned it  --  but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her bones , and forced it down so she could save up enough labels to get a free decoder ring to get special messages from Captain Cody , that intrepid hero of the airwaves . She really wanted to have that ring , but there was a Great Depression and money was very dear , so she never got the decoder or the secret messages or the degree in pharmacology . Had she been more like that little banty rooster , had she been a real go-getter ... Well  --  it was all but over now . ) <p> The main players were assembled in the room . She ... was nodding in and out but she could hear . There she was , in this apparent stupor , but she was more aware than anyone could know . She heard someone say somebody at McDonald 's put " everything " on her hamburger instead of " cheese and ketchup only . " They were making an issue out of it . One day , when they were in her shoes , they would learn to ignore this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was how things were , that 's all . Life . That was it . That was what it was . And here she lay ... dying . <p> Suddenly she realized that the hard part was all over now . All she had to do was ... let go . It really was n't so bad . It was n't ... anything special . It just was . She was trying to bring back Barnes one last time  --  that little memory of him had been fun , why not go out with a little fun ? She tried to remember his coloring  --  orange would be too bright , rust too drab , scarlet too vivid . His head was a combination of green , yellow , and gold , all blended , and his breast and wings a kind of carmine red ? No , not carmine . He was just a little red rooster , overly pugnacious , an ingrate . He could have been a beautiful bird if he had n't gotten into so many fights . He got his comb ripped off by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big bull raccoon that Barnes had fought tooth and nail until Fred ran into the henhouse with his .410 and killed the thieving intruder . Those eggs were precious . They were income , Mr. Barnes was hero that day . She remembered how he used to strut around the barnyard . He always had his eye on all of the hens ; they were his main priority , some thirty to forty of them , depending . They were his harem and he was the sheik . Boy , was he ever . She remembered jotting down marks on a pad of paper one day when she was home sick with chicken pox . Each mark represented an act of rooster fornication . In less than a day , Mr. Barnes had committed a sexual act forty-seven times that she could see  --  and she did n't have the whole lay of the land from her window by any means . Why , he often went out roving and carousing with hens on other farms . There were bitter complaints from the neighbors . Barnes really could stir things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and round him up . Mr. Barnes was a legend in the county . Mr. Barnes thought the whole world belonged to him and beyond that  --  the suns , the stars , and the Milky Way  --  all of it ! Did it feel good or was it torment ? It must have been a glorious feeling , she decided . Maybe that was what Arthur Schopenhauer was driving at in his theory about the Will to Live . Mr. Barnes was the very personification of it . <p> Of course it was hard work being a rooster , but Barnes seemed the happiest creature she had ever known . Probably because when you 're doing what you really want to do , it is n't work . No matter how dull things got on the farm , she could watch Barnes by the hour . Barnes could even redeem a hot , dog-day afternoon in August . He was n't afraid of anything or anybody . Did he ever entertain a doubt ? Some kind of rooster worry ? Never ! She tried to conjure up one last picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't have weighed three pounds . Maybe Mr. Barnes would be waiting for her on the other side and would greet her there and be her friend again . <p> She nodded in and out . In and out . The morphine was getting to be too much . Oh , please God . She hoped she would n't puke ... So much left unsaid , undone . Well , that was all part of it . If only she could see Barnes strut his stuff one last time . " Come on , Barnes . Strut your stuff for me . " Her brother , Fred , sitting there so sad with his hamburger . After a couple of beers , he could do a pretty good imitation of Mr. Barnes . Could he ... would he ... for old time 's sake ? Her voice was too weak , she could n't speak . Nowhere near . Not even close . Was she dead already ? Fading to black ? It was hard to tell . " Do n't feel bad , my darling brother . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... one last thing  --  " Sarah , I do love you , darling ! Love you ! Did n't you know that ? Did n't it show ? If not , I 'm so , so very sorry ... " But the words would n't come  --  could n't come . She ... was so sick . You can only get so sick and then there was all that dope . Love ! She should have shown it to her daughter instead of ... assuming . She should have been more demonstrative , more forthcoming ... That 's what it was all about . Love your brother as yourself and love the Lord God almighty with all your heart and mind and soul . You were sent here to love your brother . Do your best . Be kind to animals , obey the Ten Commandments , stuff like that . Was that it ? Huh ? Or was that all a lot of horseshit ? <p> She ... nodded in and out . Back and forth . In and out . She went back and forth . In and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was n't any tunnel or white light or any of that . She just ... died . <p> Thom Jones 's stories have appeared in The New Yorker , Esquire , and Story .
