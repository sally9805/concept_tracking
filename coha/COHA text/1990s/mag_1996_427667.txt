Section : Business &; technology Cover story In a global economy , it 's hard to know who made your gift  --  and under what conditions <p> It 's a perfect Kodak moment . On Christmas morning under the tree , Amanda is thrilled with her trendy new pair of Guess jeans and her Songbird Barbie doll . Joey thinks his new Nike cross-trainers are way cool , and he 's in love with his Disney 101 Dalmatians jogging gear . Baby Sis is already kicking her new hand-sewn soccer ball in an imaginary game with her new 51-inch giant Bernie St. Bernard , which Mom bought from the world 's most exclusive toy store , F.A.O . Schwarz , in New York City . <p> But if the kids knew how some of these gifts were made , it might cast a decided pall on their holiday cheer . Former workers and union organizers allege that some Guess clothing is made by suppliers who use underpaid Latino immigrants in Los Angeles , sometimes in their own homes . Mattel makes tens of millions of Barbies a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrated thousands of miles from home are alleged to earn less than the minimum wage of $1.99 a day . Nike is criticized for manufacturing many of its shoes in tough labor conditions in Indonesia , and some of Disney 's hottest seasonal products are being made by suppliers in Sri Lanka and Haiti  --  countries with unsavory reputations for labor and human rights . The soccer balls are sewn together by child laborers in Pakistan , and F.A.O . Schwarz 's $150 Bernie St. Bernard was made in Indonesia ; the company wo n't reveal who made the doggie , or under what conditions , for proprietary reasons . <p> Eye of the beholder . In an era when the economy is necessarily a global one , it is impossible for consumers to avoid products made under less than ideal labor conditions . Moreover , what may appear to be horrific working environments to most citizens in the world 's richest nation are not just acceptable but actually attractive to others who live overseas or even in " Third World pockets " of the United States . Anyone even casually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) housekeepers or nannies is well aware of the vast potential for hypocrisy when those same Americans then decide to sit in judgment of corporations . <p> Still , a growing number of manufacturers and retailers are coming under fire for how the goods they make and sell are produced . It started in earnest with the discovery of indentured Asian workers in a California garment factory in 1995 . Then came reports about conditions in factories in Indonesia that make Nike products and plants in Central America and New York that produced clothing under the brand name of TV personality Kathie Lee Gifford for sale at Wal-Mart . A No Sweat campaign by Labor Secretary Robert Reich against U.S. sweatshops has turned up the heat . And a presidential task force debating the issue of sweatshops in the apparel industry is expected to issue its report early next year . <p> In short , labor , civic , religious , investor and consumer groups are pushing to improve the conditions of workers at the lowest end of a global supply chain . Some of these groups are advancing their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for decades have seized on arguments to oppose imports . But the cumulative effect of their campaigns is growing . Aided by Internet connections , for example , student groups are joining in , publishing lists of companies that allegedly make or sell goods produced in abysmal working conditions . " It 's driving us nuts , " says Tracy Mullin , president of the National Retail Federation , which represents the bulk of the nation 's $1.3 trillion ( not counting cars and groceries ) retail industry . A U.S. News poll shows that 6 in 10 Americans are concerned about working conditions under which products are made in the United States and more than 9 in 10 are concerned about the working conditions under which products are made in Asia and Latin America . But few consumers possess enough information to make informed buying decisions ( box , Page 60 ) . <p> What makes the issue so staggeringly complex is that the current system of global sourcing is n't all bad . The search for inexpensive labor benefits U.S. consumers , who enjoy far lower prices than their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in real terms in recent years , thanks in large part to global sourcing . That eases inflationary pressures for the whole economy . In many cases , global procurement networks provide badly needed income , and often the only chance of work at all , for workers overseas , whether Pakistani families in that nation 's soccer-ball capital of Sialkot or Salvadoran immigrants in tough L.A. neighborhoods . <p> Moreover , today 's Third World nation can be tomorrow 's developmental success story . Take South Korea . A decade or so ago , Nike had most of its sneakers manufactured there ; now , South Korea has evolved into an industrial powerhouse with a higher living standard , and Nike makes most of its shoes in Indonesia and China . <p> Even the most zealous advocacy groups urge major U.S. manufacturers abroad not to shut down their factories , just to improve them . Some major U.S. manufacturers and retailers are already responding . Levi Strauss &; Co. , the nation 's largest apparel manufacturer , which works with contractors in 50 countries , is an acknowledged leader in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuses to do business in countries with subpar human-rights records , such as Burma . Similarly , Reebok has just announced that it will reorganize the way it buys 350,000 soccer balls a year in Pakistan . Rather than cut the panels of soccer balls in a factory and send them out to villages to be sewn together , often by children , the company now insists that all the work be done at the factory , where better control is possible . Each ball sold here will then carry the label : " Guarantee : Manufactured Without Child Labor . " <p> Hired monitors . Elsewhere , a four-year-old San Francisco-based group , Business for Social Responsibility , is teaching 800 member companies how to better manage their international purchasing . Concerns have even given birth to a new industry : There are now businesses , such as California Safety Compliance , that charge companies for monitoring work conditions in their plants around the world . <p> Some retailers also are responding . Sears , which carries 200,000 products from manufacturers operating in virtually every country , is tightening up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gap , after enduring months of withering criticism , also has become a model for manufacturing and sourcing products abroad , experts say . <p> But abuses persist , even in the United States . From New York to Los Angeles , apparel is still being made in ways that resemble **25;1312;TOOLONG exploitation of at least 1 million immigrant workers , many of whom speak little or no English and do n't understand their rights . Manufacturers can play contractor against contractor , constantly driving down prices for their goods . <p> A bitter labor dispute involving apparel maker Guess is emblematic of problems affecting many companies . Guess designs high-end jeans and cuts the denim at its headquarters in an industrial district of eastern Los Angeles . Like other clothing makers , Guess turns to subcontractors to actually sew and condition the jeans . Unlike many other makers , Guess has kept its subcontracting system in America rather than eliminate all U.S. jobs by moving it overseas . The company then markets the jeans and other accessories as " An American Tradition " and sells them at premium prices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subcontracting network , made up of people like Cristobal Perez and Emilia Hernandez . The 30-ish Mexican couple with two small children worked for Kelly Sportswear , a Guess contractor , for five years until the Vietnamese owner , known only as Roberto , closed the factory in the L.A. suburb of El Monte . Roberto allegedly forced workers to pay money back to him at the end of the week if they had n't fulfilled certain quotas , former workers say . His books showed that he was paying his employees the minimum wage ( about $200 a week ) , but they say in fact they often made as little as $120 . <p> To avoid falling short , Perez and Hernandez took work home . " If we wanted enough money for the week , we had to do it at home , " says Perez . " We had no alternative . " Roberto also made workers start work in the mornings without punching in and clock out in the evenings while continuing to work  --  forced overtime with no pay , according to the workers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banning work in private homes a second time , Guess pulled its work out of his shop , after which he closed the doors and fired dozens of workers . <p> " Only do so much . " Guess executives say they were unaware of the abuses at Kelly Sportswear or other contractors and maintain that their system of compliance inspection is exemplary . " All our inspections showed that Kelly Sportswear was in complete compliance , " says J. Irma Melwani , head of contractor compliance . She says all 60 shops currently meet legal and safety standards , but the company declined to provide a list of them . Guess also says that the Union of Needletrades , Industrial and Textile Employees , an AFL-CIO affiliate that is attempting to organize both Guess inside shops and contractors , is running a smear campaign . Late last month , however , the U.S. Department of Labor signaled its concern with Guess by temporarily suspending it from its list of companies with high labor standards . <p> Melwani argues that Guess and other companies can not completely control what happens in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing that workers are paid the minimum wage but then demand kickbacks at the end of a week , Guess would n't know this when it audited payroll records . The company also says it routinely speaks to workers in its contracting shops without the presence of management , but some workers interviewed by U.S. News said the inspectors were far from neutral . " We can only do so much , " says Melwani . The company says unionization of its operations would raise costs so much that it would be forced to move overseas . <p> Conditions in some ways are worse in New York 's Garment District , which like Los Angeles 's produces clothing for hundreds of brand-name manufacturers and retailers . Rather than working in one- or two-story structures dispersed over a wide area , as in Los Angeles , workers take dilapidated elevators to the tops of tenement buildings of 12 or more stories . Then they walk down , flight by flight , looking for work . Names of companies are scrawled on walls like so much graffiti , allowing owners to shift names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " No Work . No Trabajo . " But tens of thousands of immigrants do find work in shops whose proprietors routinely close up and disappear without paying workers weeks ' worth of wages . " I have had foreign leaders say to me : Do n't talk about conditions in our country because you have slave labor in your own country , " says Maria Echaveste , the Department of Labor 's wage and hour administrator . <p> One icon of American culture whose manufacturing practices seem out of sync with its brand name is Disney , which is making a holiday merchandising blitz for its characters and movies . Disney maintains almost 4,000 contracts with other companies that assume the right to manufacture Disney paraphernalia , some of which are then sold in Disney stores . These licensees go to some of the world 's lowest-cost-labor countries , including Sri Lanka and Indonesia , to produce stuffed animals and clothes . Disney itself rarely takes a direct hand in manufacturing . <p> Fun clothes . Disney 's main nemesis is Charles Kernaghan , executive director of the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gifford 's case to light . In his 16th-floor New York office , Kernaghan points to a pile of clothes . Most of it is children 's wear made in Haiti , all prominently displaying the latest Disney themes : Pocahontas , the Hunchback of Notre Dame and 101 Dalmatians . He picks up one item  --  a handsome children's-size sweat shirt and sweat pants outfit manufactured at a factory in Port-au-Prince . According to Kernaghan , workers in Haiti received 6 cents for producing this item , which retails for $19.99 in the United States . The wages are attractive in a country with overwhelming unemployment but would surprise many American purchasers of the goods . <p> At one Disney-related apparel factory in Port-au-Prince , he wrote in May : " Rats are everywhere . The drinking water is right next to the toilet , which is filthy . Women are getting infections from the water , so the company dumps in more chlorine .... The supervisors are always screaming at workers to work faster . " According to Kernaghan , the pay at that time was about 28 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pocahontas T-shirts or hem 101 Dalmatians sweat pants . <p> In a written statement to U.S. News , Disney said it stipulates in writing that any subcontractor manufacturing in Haiti or elsewhere must adhere to all applicable laws regarding employment and working conditions . In addition , Disney says it acted quickly upon hearing Kernaghan 's reports , setting up a monitoring system and sending representatives to inspect the factories in question . Kernaghan acknowledges that conditions have improved  --  workers are now being paid at least the minimum wage of 32 cents an hour , or about $2.50 a day , and factories have been cleaned up somewhat . But , he says , much more needs to be done . Last week , Kernaghan kicked off a " Disney Week " of demonstrations , including one outside the Disney store on Fifth Avenue in New York , to lobby for better working conditions for Haitian and other workers making Disney products . <p> Unfortunately , it 's not so simple . " If the Haitian government were to raise the minimum wage much higher , then they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are operating there , " says Cynthia Knobel , a spokesperson for VF Corp. , parent of H.H. Cutler , one of two key contractors for Disney in Haiti . " The margin we make on those products is so slim , I 'm not sure we could afford to continue to manufacture there . " <p> In contrast to Disney , Mattel does most of its own manufacturing . It makes a staggering 100 million Barbie dolls a year in four factories , two in China and one each in Malaysia and Indonesia . The Barbie craze produced $1.4 billion in annual revenues for the El Segundo , Calif. , company out of its total annual revenues of $3.6 billion in 1995 . <p> Mattel 's Barbie factory in Changan township of China 's Guangdong Province near Hong Kong is better managed than dozens of Hong Kong- or Taiwan-owned factories in the same area that engage in ruthless exploitation of workers . The Mattel Toys plant , or Mei Tai in Chinese , is a neat , no-frills facility sitting behind a low wall . The company declined to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women running sewing machines with spools of neon pink thread are visible from the street through a couple of tinted-glass windows that have been left open . During shift changes , young female workers wearing Mattel IDs and speaking the national Mandarin language ( which suggests they are migrants from other provinces ) saunter in from two dormitories located within walking distance . <p> Wage dispute . Critics , however , say one problem is that the young women sometimes work with dangerous chemicals . But Chan Ka Wai , associate director of the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee , which monitors foreign-invested factories in south China , says the biggest problem is wages . Mattel says it pays above the minimum required by local law . But Chan alleges that Mattel requires workers to toil much longer during peak production periods , driving hourly pay below official minimums . As a result , Mattel 's critics allege , some workers make only $1.81 a day versus the minimum of $1.99 . <p> In California , Mattel Senior Vice President Glenn Bozarth declines specifically to address how much money workers actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high standards " in terms of safety and ventilation in its Chinese plants . " It 's not a situation in which we are abusing people or there are health issues involved , " says Bozarth . If , as worker representatives contend , female employees in China are exploited when traveling from distant parts of the country to the plant , Bozarth says the company can not be blamed . The travel , he says , is arranged and carried out by local government officials . <p> Does a global economy mean consumers face no choice but to buy products made under conditions Americans do n't want to think about ? A number of U.S. companies say that intense global competition is no excuse for keeping working standards at the lowest possible level . Levi Strauss , for example , imposes its own " terms of engagement " on manufacturers who make its jeans products in 50 countries . The company 's employees were the driving force in launching a major shake-up of Levi 's sourcing standards starting in 1991 . Aside from introducing guidelines and actively monitoring how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries where it would operate so that it could better understand local conditions . It shut down three factories in Burma and decided against operating in Haiti or El Salvador because of concerns over labor standards . It also decided to conduct only minimal business in China through a Hong Kong affiliate . <p> When the company first announced its new standards , it discovered that 30 percent of its contractors did n't measure up . But rather than severing the relationships , Levi 's transferred technical know-how or channeled contributions from the company 's charitable foundation to such programs as child care , thereby bringing its non-American contractors up to standards that exceeded local laws and regulations . By so doing , it was able to continue doing business with the majority of its suppliers . But it dropped one sixth of them because they declined to change their ways . <p> Alice Tepper Marlin , executive director of the Council on Economic Priorities , a New York nonprofit group that ranks companies for their social policies , gives Levi 's high marks for training people in many countries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and for monitoring their efforts . That 's in sharp contrast to companies that may introduce codes of conduct but never enforce them or translate them into languages spoken by non-American workers . Levi 's reputation as a socially conscious firm has received a boost , and Levi 's executives say the company 's sales have been enhanced as a result of its efforts . <p> In fact , Levi 's success has helped spawn a minimovement . One senior Levi 's executive , Robert Dunn , left the company to found Business for Social Responsibility in 1992 . More than 800 companies , ranging from retailers like Home Depot and Dayton Hudson to manufacturers like Hasbro and Timberland , are now members . The nonprofit group conducts training sessions to advise companies on setting up their contracting and subcontracting systems . <p> Practical benefits . Reflecting Levi 's experience , the emphasis is on working with a manageable number of partners , imposing a code of conduct and enforcing it . The key question , says Aron Cramer , director of the nonprofit group 's business and human-rights program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structured in a way to get best price and best delivery and at the same time display the best attitudes regarding labor fairness ? " When companies treat suppliers and local workers properly , he argues , one practical business benefit is lower employee turnover and higher product quality . <p> Consumer concerns about child laborers in Pakistan stitching together soccer balls also seem to be forcing a gradual but important restructuring of that industry . Three Pakistani-owned companies in Sialkot dominate the soccer-ball industry in Pakistan , which makes 36 million soccer balls each year  --  60 percent of the world 's total . These balls are sold to Adidas , Reebok , Nike , Puma and other Western athletic companies . Reebok is leading the way by demanding that its balls be stitched under more supervised conditions . So far , that affects just a tiny percentage of the total production . But other Western companies and the international soccer federation ( FIFA ) are pushing such makers as Saga Sports to shift much more production from remote villages into stitching centers to manufacture " allegation free " balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pay for the massive monitoring that would be required to completely clean up the consumer products arena . Retailers , who say they eke out a narrow 2 percent profit margin on average , argue that they can not afford to pay for monitoring or assume legal responsibility for the products they sell , as one bill pending before Congress would require . The Retail Federation 's Mullin says it is up to the Department of Labor to do a better job enforcing immigration and labor standards in the United States . But the department has only 1,300 inspectors . Even though that number is gradually being increased to 1,500 , it is still far too few to keep tabs on every manufacturing shop in the land . For their part , 89.3 percent of consumers say they are willing to pay a few more cents for peace of mind in buying product , but only 70.2 percent are willing to pay a few more dollars , the U.S. News poll found . <p> While the government , retailers and manufacturers quibble , consumers still hold enormous leverage . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sweeping solutions will emerge , because the industry is so huge and fractured . But what does seem possible are small steps and innovations , over a period of time , that will add up to an improvement of global sourcing standards . Some practical shopping tips can help ( box ) . <p> In many ways , what Americans buy is their most direct and intimate connection with a global economy . In a post-cold-war era in which governments seem to be losing their power to shape the lives of people , U.S. consumer spending can be an important tool in extending American values . The silver lining is that if Americans respond to even some of these concerns , they could enjoy their shopping and improve the conditions that millions of people around the world encounter in their daily lives . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Not child 's play .

Ito <p> THE TOY STORY <p> Toy Story action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How the product gets from Disney to a retailer 's shelves is a long , complicated process : Design/License . Disney licenses the Buzz Lightyear figure to Thinkway Toys , a manufacturer in Markham , Ontario . They design the product together . Finding producers . Thinkway searches the world to find low-cost subcontractors to produce the toy . It settles on a factory in southern China where workers are paid about $2 a day to assemble parts from around the world . Inspection . After the product is made , it is shipped to factories in Hong Kong or other parts of China where it is inspected by the buying agents  --  typically , the buyers for major retail chains like Wal-Mart , Kmart or Toys " R " Us . Shipping . Thinkway 's Hong Kong arm , Super Technology Ltd. , arranges for the product to be delivered to the " consolidators , " the agents of the major retailers , who ship the product to the U.S. by boat . Entering the U.S. The toy enters a major U.S. port like Long Beach , Calif. , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retailer 's distribution center . Into the stores . The toy arrives at your local store . The $8 retail price reflects the cost of shipping , marketing , materials and Disney 's licensing agreement . Wages paid to the workers in China make up only a tiny percent of the price . <p> USN &WR;  --  Basic data : Thinkway Toys , AFL-CIO 's Food and Allied Services Trades , Port Import Export Reporting Service , the Walt Disney Co . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> SOME STEPS CONSUMERS CAN TAKE <p> HOW TO SHOP <p> There 's no way to pick up a product and instantly know exactly how it was made . But there are very practical things you can do over a period of time to give yourself greater confidence about what you buy : Recommendation 1 . Look to see where things are made . Almost every product carries a tag , even if it is located in an out-of-the-way place . Ask store managers what they know about a product 's origins . Request copies of sourcing policies from retailers as well as catalog and television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll know that a retailer may not know , or care , where products come from . " It 's important to ask , " says Alice Tepper Marlin , executive director of the Council on Economic Priorities . Recommendation 2 . Exercise discretion regarding certain countries . Opponents of the regime in Burma , for instance , have urged a consumer boycott . Many other countries with controversial political regimes that export extensively to the U.S. are slightly better , including Haiti , El Salvador , Honduras , Vietnam , Sri Lanka , and Indonesia . China is in a class by itself because of the huge volume of products it is making . Boycotting is n't helpful because it simply throws people out of work . " If Americans decided they were n't going to buy soccer balls made in Pakistan , a million people would be out of jobs tomorrow , " says a Reebok executive . It is more effective to ask questions about countries of origin , transmitting concern . Recommendation 3 . Do n't assume that a made-in-the-U.S.A. label means a product is necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans , often are not . <p> Recommendation 4 . Look for a union label , but do n't draw too many conclusions from it . These labels often do n't appear on enough items to give consumers a meaningful choice . Usually a union-made item costs more . Recommendation 5 . Check the U.S. Department of Labor 's Web site http : **47;1339;TOOLONG . If a manufacturer or retailer is listed , chances are good it uses enlightened sourcing practices . Recommendation 6 . Ask manufacturers directly , either by letter , telephone hot line or Internet , about their codes of conduct for their own plants as well as those of subcontractors . The best companies will respond to you personally . If they do n't , that may tell you something . Recommendation 7 . Over a period of time , reward manufacturers and retailers you trust . Vote with your dollars . If you like the quality and price you get , and at the same time feel the company is trying to respond to your concerns , that 's a doubly good shopping experience . Recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of products beyond safety , quality and price to include workplace conditions . One such body is the Council on Economic Priorities , which ranks nearly 200 consumer-product companies on the basis of indicators including workplace issues .
