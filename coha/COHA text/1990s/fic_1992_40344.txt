This woman has come from afar . She can be seen walking in the meadow near her cabin , followed by two goats , three tiny kids , and a big , bearlike white dog . Wildflowers grow in the meadow , and birds make beautiful sounds , bits of song , which she strings together on the silver lines of her flute . It seems to be the most peaceful life imaginable , this life in the meadow , and that is why she sought it and worked so hard to bring it into being . <p> But even she , with her vision of harmony , does not know how beautiful she is , this tiny , dark woman , strolling in the meadow grass , making music as her small menagerie straggles and scampers around her and behind . As she lies down in the soft-and-pricking grasses and looks up at the small clouds in a suddenly blue sky , one of the kids puts its nose against her cheek , its long-lashed brown eyes gaze into the long-lashed brown eyes of a woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not easily maintained , for it means rushing home from work each night , traveling an hour from the city where she translates letters from Spanish to English , and then her employers ' replies , from English back to Spanish . And then , after the long drive through gradually thinning traffic , the animals greet her needily , and must be fed and petted , and her dog , her big , beloved friend , must have a walk , while the goats come along for company . And the lamps must be lit with care , because there is no electricity yet on this road , and wood must be split and restacked inside the cabin . But all this effort to maintain her refuge helps keep her mind clear and free , helps her to forget where she came from  --  afar  --  which was what is called a police state , though the only police were not protectors , maintainers of order , but victimizers , virtuosos of chaos . <p> When Cecilia lies in the meadow looking up at small clouds in azure , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an iron door clanging shut  --  or worse , open  --  or the lovely afternoon sun , when it is turned on again , becomes a glaring interrogation lamp . And she is forced to remember that somewhere in the world , at this very moment , a woman , maybe a hundred women and men , maybe more ( no longer , for now , in her own country , but elsewhere , many elsewheres )  --  are caught in that tearing , searing reality . It lacerates her spirit , tears her open again , to know that she can not change such an impossible truth . <p> And she wills to them , to those who are still caught , or newly caught in the same old web , a soft , tender nose-nudge from one of these kids . She sends them good goat 's milk , or her own soft , pure goat cheese in small rounds , like those clouds above  --  floats them there by azure delivery . Here , she says , partake of this and be nourished , be strong for reclaiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up just the same . Almost suffocating , she sits up suddenly in the meadow and looks about her , counting all her gentle creatures , calling the big , fluffy dog , who comes bounding toward her with a smile on his friendly bear face . She looks at the row of trees at the edge of the meadow , hoping to see the blue heron . But the heron is not there today . So she lilts her flute from the grass and rises to her feet to walk some more . As she walks , her fingers and her breath find a market song from her childhood , a song about fruits and gourds and many-colored birds . <p> One day , in mid-autumn when the trees around the meadow are burgundy and orange and gold , Cecilia receives a letter from a woman she met on the day they were all released from the prison . For months they had suffered in neighboring rooms , but never seen each other . When the doors were opened , they all became sisters in a moment , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . This woman , Rosa , who was tall and must have been blond once , when her hair knew the sun , was heavily pregnant on that day of release . <p> When Cecilia , sitting on a wooden bench beside her , asked how long she had been in prison , Rosa said , " Almost a year , I think . " Looked down at her belly then , and after a moment whispered , " Yes . " <p> Now Rosa is writing to ask that her friend of a day , of the day of liberation , her friend of a few brief letters , sponsor her entry to the new country . " It is the only chance I have , " she writes . And though Cecilia knows the torturers are gone , or merely , mildly , walking the streets of their country now like innocent citizens , she can imagine the family 's pain over the coming of that child , now three years old . The husband , who had been out of the country when Rosa was arrested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's beginnings and left very soon . Rosa 's parents did better , and the little one 's grandmother will even weep with anguish when they drive Rosa and little Jesus to the airport . She will be losing her only happiness , her only joy , after all the pain . But Rosa must begin in a new place , begin from afar . <p> It is late winter when Cecilia drives along the snow-flanked highway to the airport to meet her friend . She knows it is insane to do this , she may not even have the strength to manage it . Her cabin is small . There is a man at work that she was just beginning to trust a bit , and now there will be no time for him , no easy place to get to know him in her life . And worst  --  the past will be with her every day now , it will be much more difficult to keep it afar . <p> And yet she could not refuse . To give goat 's milk in a small cup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . That is God 's reply to her shipments of goat 's cheese sent effortlessly away on small clouds . Now you may truly nourish ! But not until spring , for the goats are dry now , waiting for their new babies to come and their milk to flow again . <p> " Hola ! Rosa ! There you are ! " she laughs , as the tall , weary-looking blond woman with a child on her hip walks from the customs gate . <p> " Cecilia ! Oh , I was afraid you would n't be here ! " Rosa lets her fingers slip from the handle of the heavy bag as Cecilia lifts it away from her . The freed hand goes first around her child to steady him on her hip , then back to greet Cecilia , warmly gliding past her shoulder as they hug one another . <p> " Of course I am here , " says Cecilia . She pauses , a bit shyly , then looks from Rosa 's hazel-colored eyes to the dark brown ones of her child , who studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . A chill comes over her , at the back of her neck especially , as she looks at him . <p> " Jesus , this is Tia Cecilia , " his mother says . She kisses his cheek and sets him down on the dirty marble floor . Cecilia squats down to be at his level . <p> " Buenos dias , Jesus , " she tells him . " Do you want to see the goats at my house ? " <p> He nods slowly . <p> Rosa laughs . " Mamita too ! I want to see them as much as Jesus does ! " <p> Cecilia smiles and says something kind . She leads them quickly to her car , limping with the weight of the heavy bag that is too big for her . But she is doing it all automatically , with a heart that is frozen in shock at one fact  --  her instant recognition of the child 's face . <p> She is taking into her refuge a miniature , a tiny replica of the one who tormented her most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to remember that she decided not to give them her beloved tiny sleeping loft . It is such a perfect place for a child , she almost felt required to offer it . Thank heaven , she made up the downstairs bed for them instead , in the open living space that is most of her little cabin . She will need to retreat to the loft , she will need to hide from her memories of that face . How can Rosa bear it ? Why did n't she run away when her husband did , leave the baby with his grandmother , give him to an orphanage , do something to escape being haunted this way ? It could have happened to me , he could have been born to me ! <p> They are in the house now , away from the winter cold . She has done everything automatically , she has not really heard Rosa 's answers to all her questions , she has not heard her own answers to Rosa 's questions , her exclamations of amazement over winter and snow . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she stirs up the coals in her wood stove and adds a new log , and offers Rosa and Jesus something warm to drink . <p> " Que lindo ! " says Rosa as they wander about the snug , one-room space of her cabin with its sleeping loft above . " How beautiful you make it here ! " <p> " It 's just a small log cabin , " says Cecilia . " But I love it . " She shows Rosa the small kitchen alcove and the bathroom  --  the only room with a door that the cabin has . <p> Rosa touches a richly colored handwoven rug from the mountain country near their home  --  red and burgundy , goldenrod , deep blue and brown . It hangs on the wall near the back door . She looks at Cecilia with tears in her eyes . " Home , " she says , and smiles a wonderfully sad , loving , and ironic smile . Only the most courageous spirits can make such gentle , complicated smiles ! <p> " Si , " says Cecilia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to find some sweet memories of home to look at here . " She leads them across the room to the mattress on the floor , with its bright woolen blanket from home . " Here is your bed , " she says . " And this cupboard is empty for you to put your things . " She swings the doors open to show them the welcoming space . A little blue truck sits on the top shelf : " Who is this for ? " she says to Jesus . He eyes her seriously . " Who do you think it is for ? " she says again , and she is able to smile . <p> " Para mi ? " <p> " Si ! For you , " she says . " Take it . " And his little hand reaches shyly up to the shelf , just within his reach it is , and his fingers close over the blue truck . For a moment he is just a child . That face that he has , in his innocence , genetically borrowed disappears for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening she looks down at them from the railing of her loft . Rosa has fallen asleep with her arm around Jesus , who sleeps curled toward her , with the little blue truck held tightly in one fist . Cecilia told them she would leave one lamp burning low for them . <p> Really she is the one who is afraid of darkness this night . She is afraid of waking up in darkness . But even with the light on , the dreams come to her . That face comes back , a face so handsome in its way that one could learn to hate beauty forever . Face so ugly that one could never see beauty again . She sits up abruptly , shaking . The dim light is a torture too . Darkness would be better . <p> Shaking , she descends the ladder from her loft , goes to the kitchen alcove for a glass of water . <p> " NO ! NO ! " Rosa shouts . So she has dreams too ! The child begins to whimper . <p> " It 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room to her . <p> She kneels down to the mattress on the floor and puts her hand on Rosa 's shoulder . " You are in my house , Rosa , you 're safe . " <p> Rosa looks up at her with lovely eyes . " Ahh , Cecilia ! Oh , I 'm so sorry I woke you ! " <p> " No , it 's I who woke you . I had a dream too . " <p> " But we 're safe ? " Rosa says . " We 're safe in your house ? " <p> " Yes , " says Cecilia . " Safe in my house . I 'm going to turn off the lamp now . We wo n't dream anymore . Or if we do  --  we 'll dream with the angels . " <p> She leans forward to kiss Rosa 's forehead , to adjust the blankets round Jesus ' shoulders . " Que suenes con los angelitos . " <p> " Con los angelitos , " says Rosa , smiling up at her ... with haunted eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine that makes the loss of privacy , the harshness of memory , easier for Cecilia to bear . There is the pleasure of sharing her food , her shelter . There is the comradeship of Rosa 's presence , and the child 's delight in the animals . And very quickly Rosa begins to keep house for her while she is at work . <p> When she comes home , dinner has already been cooked , the kerosene lamps have been lit . One night the animals have been watered and fed also , but Cecilia quickly explains that this is her special pleasure  --  not so much a chore as the joy of her day . And Rosa gladly leaves that to her , just taking care of the house , the wood stove , and the cooking . Even that Cecilia misses somehow , but she relinquishes it for her friend 's sake . Rosa needs to feel she is doing something to pay her own way . Before the time in prison she had been a teacher of young children . <p> " When you have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching job here , " Cecilia says , as they take coffee outdoors together , one mild afternoon in early spring . " They need teachers who know Spanish . " <p> " Not yet , " says Rosa . " I 'd be so afraid . " She laughs nervously , giving Cecilia a brief imploring glance . And Cecilia realizes that as far as Rosa is concerned , this arrangement could be very comfortable for a long , long time . <p> They sit , without chairs , on the deck of her cabin , their coffee mugs beside their knees , as they watch the rushing spring waters of the nearby stream . Jesus is lying astride Leo , her big white dog , burying his face in the soft fur . <p> " No , not yet , of course , " says Cecilia . Unspoken between them both  --  the fears each has of the other . For Rosa  --  the fear of being sent into the cold world ; for Cecilia  --  the fear of never being alone again . <p> Only a few nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke heavy inside the cabin , and black soot up the side of one wall . The tapestry from home is singed partway up , and the bottom edges burnt . Her mind knows immediately what happened  --  but her emotions are frantic with shock , with possibilities of chaos . <p> " Cecilia  --  I 'm so sorry ! " Rosa says . Her beautiful long face is taut with worry and fear . " Jesus was playing with the cat on top of the table somehow  --  and the lamp fell over ! I was cooking dinner , I did n't watch him close enough . " She pauses , looks desperately for some sign from Cecilia . " I 'm so ashamed ! " she says . <p> Fire is licking at Cecilia 's eyes , it is singeing her feet , her heart . Nothing is safe . There is no refuge . " I 'm  --  glad you were n't hurt , " she manages to say . " It 's  --  a shock , is all . Let me sit down a minute . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She follows Cecilia to the couch . <p> Cecilia leans forward , places her head in her hands a few moments . Then looks up again . " For you too  --  it must have been worse , with the flames here , the danger ! " <p> " Maybe not , " says Rosa . " I had to move so fast  --  I had to put it out ! If Jesus was hurt  --  or if we destroyed your house  --  I would have killed myself . " <p> " You do n't mean that . " Cecilia is annoyed by such a declaration . How would that help ? <p> " I do . Even now  --  I am sick with shame that we did this to your home ! " <p> " I have to do something about getting electricity , " Cecilia says . " In a few months  --  the lines may come through . " <p> " Until then  --  we will be very careful , " says Rosa . <p> " But how can a child be trusted to be careful ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on purpose ? " Cecilia feels horrible as she says it  --  but she is afraid it might be true . Fate is very strange . How can they be sure he is not somehow an enemy ? She looks at the child for the first time since she came in . He is sitting on the bed , his own safe territory , his eyelids lowered and his straight little mouth firm with fear and solemnity . She can not bear to have him here , the danger , the dreams . There are so many things she ca n't speak of . <p> It is almost a normal evening . They eat dinner quietly . Talk gently of spring , of lamps , of electricity . Jesus is first instructed and then reassured by his mother , though Cecilia can barely speak to him , and is relieved when Rosa puts him to sleep . <p> When the dishes are washed and things put away , they sit down together on the sofa , a pot of peppermint tea on the old trunk Cecilia uses for a coffee table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands Rosa hers . They have become close , like sisters  --  but always with these unspoken things between them . <p> " There is something I need to ask you , " says Rosa . " Even before today  --  I have feared sometimes that you do n't really like Jesus . You are kind to him , of course , but  --  " <p> " He brings back memories for me , " says Cecilia . <p> " Oh . " Rosa sips her tea , though it is too hot and she puts it down , hastily . <p> " He is a wonderful child , " Cecilia says . " Forgive me if I do n't seem to understand that . I do . But tonight has shaken me up  --  terribly . " <p> " I know , " Rosa says . " It has shaken me also . " <p> " And I wonder sometimes ... " Cecilia plunges ahead . " I wonder sometimes  --  how were you able to keep him , after all that happened ? " <p> " How was I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns to face her friend more directly from her end of the sofa , gives Cecilia an almost-challenging look from her hazel eyes . Her delicate mouth with the deep lines beside it is half open , ready to respond . <p> " Both . First  --  just to keep him . Even before that  --  to give birth at all  --  how hard it must have been ! " <p> " Yes . It seemed like their ultimate triumph over me , making me carry their seed in my body . " She looks out the darkened window opposite them . <p> " Yes , " Cecilia breathes out . " That 's how I thought it would feel . It could have been me too , you know . I could have left prison in the same condition you did . " <p> " Then you know completely , " says Rosa softly . Her gaze swings to Cecilia 's eyes , offers a look of sympathy . <p> " That part of it  --  I know completely . But the rest of what you went through  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The way I got through , " says Rosa , " was that I promised myself I would kill the child when it was outside of me . " <p> " Ah ! " There is a long silence between them . Then Cecilia confesses . " It 's what I think I would have done . What I would really have done . " <p> " But then you ca n't , " says Rosa . " Then your breast is full of milk and the child is itself . It came from heaven , not from prison . That 's what you say , that 's what you hope , when you hold it for the first time . " <p> " And now  --  " Cecilia hesitates  --  " Do you love him now as if he were born out of love ? " <p> " I love him even more fiercely , perhaps . I ca n't say why . Maybe it 's an angry love , maybe it 's a tender love , I do n't know . But he is himself , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks again directly into Cecilia 's eyes . " He is just a little boy , Cecilia . " <p> " And the resemblance never  --  haunts you ? " <p> " Resemblance ? " Rosa looks at her in surprise . " What do you mean ? " <p> " I ... I do n't know . I ... get confused sometimes . " Cecilia looks at Rosa , begging for silence or understanding , or innocence , perhaps . She is not sure which of these Rosa gives her  --  but something is given . <p> " I do ... " says Rosa slowly , " I do ... almost always ... love him as if he came from me alone . " <p> " Yes , I 'm glad , I 'm so glad it 's that way , " says Cecilia . But she has to repeat that phrase , " ... almost always . " <p> " And also  --  to protect us from any memories that might come  --  " <p> " You named him Jesus . " <p> " Si . " Now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a moment when they might embrace , comfort one another . But they can not . Cecilia reaches forward , lifts the lid from the teapot . A frail wisp of steam comes forth . <p> Rosa twists her hands in her lap . Nods , as Cecilia lifts the teapot and gestures with it toward Rosa 's empty mug . <p> How can it matter how he was fathered ? But it does . It still does . <p> Maybe Rosa , with her mother 's bond , is able to forget  --  but not really , no not really . Jesus may be named to remind them constantly of the power of forgiveness , and maybe it is a real power  --  but Cecilia refuses that betrayal , refuses to forgive . And now every evening when she comes home she imagines the scorched smell is still in the cabin . She brings home flowers , she burns incense to mask it . She waits for the lilacs to bloom . On the news , she hears that her countrymen have voted to let the torturers continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will suddenly take power again , begin the horror all over again . Commentators say that perhaps it was a wise decision , perhaps this is true democracy , a haunted people 's compromise . Cecilia only knows that the torturers mildly , smugly , menacingly walk among her people , as their genes walk along pathways inside this little boy 's body . And she longs for her solitude . <p> In May , the lilacs do bloom , and five kids are born  --  Sarita has twins , and Blanca triplets . Cecilia takes the day off from work when Rosa calls her : " I think Sarita 's in labor ! " By the time she gets home , both kids are born , and Sarita has cleaned everything up , looks quite pleased with herself and these two lovely black creatures with the same dun-colored spots as their mother . Blanca watches enviously . When will her time come ? <p> That very midnight , before she goes to sleep , Cecilia goes out to the shed to find Blanca with one kid born , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet little head and one hoof reaching out . <p> " Dios ! " Rosa cries out , and Cecilia looks up to see that her friend , wrapped in a cotton bathrobe , has followed her . " Should I drive to the neighbors , call the animal doctor ? " <p> " No . This does n't look so bad , " Cecilia says . She kneels on the straw beside the laboring animal and puts her slender arms inside to push back a bit and fish in the wetness and warmth for the tiny hoof that 's lost its way . Then how easily the little creature completes its dive into life on this planet , lands gently in the straw . Then , as she watches for the placenta to come , Cecilia gives a laugh of surprise . " Blanca ! You competitive thing ! " Another kid is pushing fast against the second one , and soon the three wet , amazing little creatures are all struggling to stand up . <p> " How can she feed all three ? " Rosa asks . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . <p> " She rotates them pretty well , " Cecilia says , as she watches Blanca cleaning up the afterbirth , caring for everything with a fine skill . Cecilia strokes the newest kid and helps it to stand up . " And we 'll help out with the bottle . " <p> " Oh , I 'd love that ! " says Rosa . <p> " Then you can take the three A.M. feeding , " Cecilia teases . Rosa 's laughter is part of the warm , safe feeling as she works with the new kids , helping Blanca 's work of cleaning them  --  she wipes with a cloth as Blanca licks the wobbly creatures with her tongue . Then dipping the umbilical cords in iodine so that they can dry cleanly and fall off in their own time . <p> Finally she is ready to leave the pen , comes out to stand beside Rosa and admire the little ones . <p> Rosa 's eyes are shining like a child 's . There is a wonderful energy weaving among them , women and goats alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.M. feeding , " Rosa says eagerly . " I 'm used to it ! " <p> " Me too , " says Cecilia . " It will be nice to have some help this year . And at last  --  " she looks gravely at Rosa with a sudden , surprising , and generous flow from within her spirit  --  " at last , I can give Jesus some goat 's milk to help him grow stronger ! " <p> Rosa takes her hand away from the kid she has been touching . Its mother has nudged forward and is licking it tenderly . She looks from the goat to Cecilia . <p> " I was thinking you needed us to go soon , " she says . " I was thinking  --  you still have n't got used to Jesus somehow . " <p> This strikes Cecilia sharply , between two ribs on the left side , like a sharp instrument , or the ping of a strange tuning fork . " I was n't used to having the memories come back , " she says . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things are changing , Rosa . Look at these babies ! I 'm feeling stronger now . " <p> " And you do n't need us to go soon ? " <p> " I do , Rosa  --  you and Jesus have been good for me . I 've learned from you more than I can say . But  --  I do need to go on , I do need my solitude again . " She looks at the tears rising once again in Rosa 's eyes , feels them once again in her own . " But not , " she says , pauses almost breathlessly  --  " not until Jesus has drunk enough of this good goat 's milk ! Not until the goats are dry  --  in November . Maybe you can be ready by then ? " <p> " I can try , " says Rosa . <p> " We will drink goat 's milk too , " Cecilia says firmly  --  " to make us strong . And glad . And ready ! " <p> Rosa laughs . She gets up from the straw-colored floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shed together , into the starlight . <p> The next day they introduce the tiny kids to Jesus . He looks at the winsome , dainty creatures in amazement . He watches them drinking from the two pleased mother goats . He follows their every move with adoring eyes . <p> " Come , Jesus , " Cecilia says to him toward evening . " The mother goats have enough milk for you too . Shall I show you ? " <p> He follows her into the goat shed , where Sarita and Blanca have come in from the yard by their own door . The kids are nestled in the sweet-smelling straw of the sleeping pen . Her girls bleat passionately as they follow their old pattern , remembered from a year ago , and enter the milking area . <p> " Si , si , " she comforts them . " I 'm here , I 'm here . Jesus is here too , " she says importantly , and looks down at the tiny boy whose hand she is holding . <p> " Si , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those other eyes have disappeared . She does n't have to let the thought in . ( But it waits at the edge , it is already in , no she banishes it . ) These eyes of innocence are Jesus ' alone . <p> " Mira , Jesus ! Look , " she says . " Blanca and Sarita are going to give us milk . Blanca always comes first . " She sits down at the milking bench , and puts her arm around Jesus , guiding him down to the bench beside her . He gasps as Blanca , with her teasing face and her three black spots , jumps quickly up to her higher level of the bench , and pokes her head into the stanchion to munch at the feed Cecilia has placed there . <p> " There , lovely Blanca , you 're first again , you fine girl , " says Cecilia . She strokes Blanca 's side and , as if she were a goat herself , nudges Blanca affectionately with her forehead . She positions the pail and puts her hands around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mira ! Jesus , here comes the milk ! " she says . A strong , sweet-smelling stream of it zings into the pail . <p> " La le-che , " he agrees , saying it slowly and affectionately in his sweet child 's voice . <p> The intimacy in the small shed overwhelms her . Her dear girls , the playful , loving , motherly goats patiently , and yet exuberantly , letting down such abundance of milk . The tiny child needing it , that his bones and spirit may grow . <p> Charlotte Zoe Walker teaches at the State University of New York ( Oneonta ) .
