<p> SAN ANTONIO - Maybe they meant well , those doctors , nurses and strange people who claimed to be his relatives . But Eric Hill , his body riddled with cancer , his mind fogged by schizophrenia , was confused , fearful and restless . People bothered him - always had - and this nursing home seemed a prison . <p> Eric yearned to go home , back to his wooden crate in a field in northwest San Antonio . He wanted to resume his self-appointed " job , " obsessively cleaning the minutest speck of rubbish from the fields and roadsides of San Antonio 's medical center area . <p> That had been his life since he had slipped away from his sister 's home in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , back in 1982 . And that was the way he wanted it . <p> Like millions of other homeless people - roughly a fourth of them seriously mentally ill - Eric was a goad to the conscience and an affront to the senses . He was dirty , and he stank . <p> Unlike many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eric was rated an asset to his community . And when he died earlier this month , he did not do so unmourned . <p> Last Tuesday , as cicadas buzzed rhythmically in the live oaks , more than 100 people who live or work near Eric 's crude home gathered to remember the life of a homeless man who really had n't been homeless , a friendless man who had friends . <p> They sang songs and scattered his ashes . <p> Among those present were employees from a nearby Southwest Airlines office , police officers , former San Antonio Mayor Bill Thornton , who lives in the area , and a Hill family friend , Kenneth Lewis , a beret-wearing hermit monk from the mountains of New Hampshire . <p> " We have been touched by God through Eric , " said the Rev. John Payne , one of two San Antonio clergymen on hand to eulogize the curly haired recluse . <p> " If people were to see a picture of Eric or were told about him for the first time , " said Thornton , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeless man with nothing to do . That was not the case . Eric was deeply rooted in that area by his choice , by his investment in building what was his home and by his work . <p> " On a daily basis , he worked sunup to sundown to clean that area . I do n't mean refuse that was easily visible . He 'd pick up gum wrappers and cigarette butts . Those of us who lived or worked there , we saw Eric as part of the community and a very positive part . " <p> Thornton said he is exploring possible ways Eric can be memorialized . <p> " It may be a matter of putting a marker up on a 300-year-old tree or creating a small park area that 's for meditation , not play , " he said . " It could be a matter of putting up a plaque in this rapidly changing area saying that Eric lived here , who he was and what he did . " <p> Eric 's sister , Debbie Hill , now the owner of an antique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her brother 's early life that hinted at the strange turns it would take . No one would have guessed that Eric , a fastidious groomer , one day would be scraping his beard with a disposable razor scavenged from the garbage or washing himself down with a garden hose . <p> Theirs was an average childhood in a middle-class Illinois family . If Eric seemed something of a loner , his drop-dead good looks more than compensated . <p> " The girls would be calling him , " his sister said . <p> After high school , Eric enrolled in college , intent on becoming an optometrist . <p> All seemed well until 1974 , when Eric 's mother unexpectedly died , shortly after the family moved to Florida . <p> " There are some theories that kind of trauma can trigger schizophrenia , " Debbie Hill said . " Over the next four years , there would be oddities in his behavior . Nothing major . Two weeks before our father died in September 1978 , Eric was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic . " <p> Eric was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't like the way they made him feel . There were lethargy and horrible side effects , " his sister said . " Or he 'd feel better and he 'd stop taking them . " <p> Living with his sister , Eric was driven by his illness . He heard voices . He fretted that people meant to harm him . He 'd unexpectedly leave home for weeks or months at a time . In 1982 , he left Florida and never returned . <p> About that time , San Antonians who had occasion to be on the city 's northwest side began to notice a strange , shambling man collecting garbage along the roadways . <p> " I met him as I was going to the hospital where I was a chaplain , " said Payne . " Around Wurzbach and Interstate 10 , I saw this frail , thin man walking , bending down , picking up trash and carrying a trash bag . I stopped and tried to talk with him , but he became agitated and pretended to throw a rock . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him I was a chaplain and asked if there was anything he needed , " Payne said . " He looked at me with piercing blue eyes and did n't respond . Then he said that he had everything he needed . " <p> Others had similar experiences . <p> " Eric was not a person who wanted to make friends , " Thornton said . <p> Once , on a searingly hot day , Thornton saw Eric picking up garbage along a highway median . " I thought it was just too hot , " he said . <p> Returning some time later , Thornton found Eric still at work . <p> " I drove by and bought a liter of soft drink and drove back on the grassy median to give it to him , " he said . " But the moment I headed toward Eric , he bolted . He crossed I-10 without looking at all . He was simply getting away from me . It was a very frightening experience . " <p> Eric became somewhat more at ease with his neighbors as years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue with unseen people . Once , he was seen quarreling with a cactus - an episode that ended when Eric angrily swatted the plant with his bare hands . <p> Still , he was gentle and some of the neighborhood children began calling him " Jesus Christ . " <p> He was proud - never accepting handouts . " Eric was never seen sitting idly somewhere , or , worse , drinking a quart of beer , " Thornton said . <p> One frigid winter 's day , Payne - his car laden with shoes , jackets and other cold-weather gear - offered Eric his choice of clothing . <p> " I do n't need anything , " Eric responded . Then he paused . " I guess I could take these , " he said , reaching for three garbage bags . Eric frequently wore the garbage bags in cold weather , insulating them with discarded newspaper . <p> " He felt collecting garbage was his work , " Debbie Hill said . " He felt he had to work in order to be entitled to eat out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left meals near the Dumpsters , but the food , like other items , had to be disguised as garbage or Eric would reject it . <p> " He led a simple life , " said Lewis , the Catholic monk . " Here was a man who was surviving - prospering , even - on the refuse of a throwaway society . " <p> Last September , Eric was found lying beside a medical center roadway . He was taken to a hospital , where he was diagnosed with advanced myeloma , a cancer of the bone marrow . Several disease-related fractures of his spine also were detected . <p> In December , guardianship proceedings were begun for Eric in a San Antonio court . It was at this point that Debbie Hill was located . <p> " Eric had told them that he had a sister in Florida and an aunt and uncle somewhere in Wisconsin , " the sister said . " But they had n't been able to locate us . There was a lawyer connected to the case who was troubled , and he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more try . He sat and prayed that this would be it , then he called up the Internet . He found my cousin in Florida . " <p> Hours later , Debbie Hill said , she received a telephone call at her New Hampshire home . <p> " They told me they had found Eric , " she said . " Then they told me he was dying . It was a very bittersweet call . " <p> In February , she arrived in San Antonio . <p> " I saw Eric on the side of the street , " she said . " My heart almost leapt out of my body . I immediately stopped the car and watched this dirty , disheveled homeless person shuffling along , because of his broken back , picking up garbage . <p> " I was sure tears were pouring down my face . I was joyful to see him again . I approached him , real gentle , and said , ' Hi , Eric . ' He said , ' Hi ' and then walked the other way . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 've never seen this person before , " Eric responded . " I do n't know who she is . She 's not my sister , she 's a look-alike . " <p> She and her family rented an apartment near Eric 's crate . They gave Eric the address and told him to visit anytime . He never did . <p> For the next six months Debbie Hill , often accompanied by her husband , Doug Clickenger , and their two young children , spent hours with Eric in and out of the hospital . <p> Once , she gave Eric a small angel lapel pin that an airplane seatmate had given her . <p> " He let me pin that angel pin on that dirty sweatshirt , " she said . <p> " Every day , he and I and the kids would sit behind the Dumpster or along the street for two or three hours , " she said . " Even though he did n't know who I was , he allowed a connection he had n't allowed other people . " <p> Toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administered with his pain medication , Eric began to recognize his family . <p> But the progress was agonizingly slow . Eric agreed to let his sister 's children call him " uncle , " but then he confided to nursing home staff that he was only pretending to be their uncle . At one point , he acknowledged Debbie Hill was his sister . <p> " He hated being in the nursing home , " Debbie Hill recalled . " Every time he would see me , he would beg and beg me to get him out . He wanted so badly to go back to his field . Finally , one week before he died , he said , ' You 're my family . You can get me out of here . ' <p> " He was sick . I could n't understand why he was even up and living and moving . Finally , I promised him I would take him home . <p> " Now I have fulfilled that promise . "
