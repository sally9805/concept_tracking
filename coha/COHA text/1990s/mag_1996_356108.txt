Every uprising knows its demons on a first-name basis . The French railed at Louis and Marie Antoinette ; the Russians at Nicholas and Alexandra ; the Filipinos at Ferdinand and Imelda ; the Romanians at Nicolae and Elena . Now , in Serbia , the targets are Slobo and Mira , the nicknames of President Slobodan Milosevic and his wife Mirjana Markovic . So renowned is the President 's wife  --  never call her the First Lady to her face  --  that she is being pilloried in her own right by the protesters in Belgrade . <P> Dr. Mirjana Markovic ( Ph.D . in sociology ) is easy to mock in effigy . Dowdy but vain , she dyes her hair jet black and often tucks a single plastic flower in it . No one is allowed to imitate the style in her presence . Indeed , no one is allowed to see her brush her hair , not even the President . He once walked in while she was grooming , and she began to weep . She also wept as a teenager whenever she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsessed with Antigone , the daughter of Oedipus , who mourned for a slain brother . She rarely smiles . <P> Markovic , however , is very powerful . She is the leader of the Yugoslav United Left , an alliance of some 20 communist groups aligned with her husband 's socialist party . Her column in Duga , a Belgrade bimonthly magazine , is closely watched for the latest clues to her husband 's policies . Her cryptic comments , intermingled with poetic observations on weather , have led Serbs to call her column " the Horoscope . " In addition , Markovic believes herself to be clairvoyant and claims to have foreseen the disintegration of Yugoslavia while seated on a beach near Dubrovnik with her husband . <P> Slobo and Mira have two children : Marija , 31 , and Marko , 23 . Markovic once doted on Marija , whom she named for a Yugoslav war heroine , Marija Bursac . But , she told her official biographer , " I realized at one point that my Marija will never be Marija Bursac . " Marija went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs a radio station owned by her mother 's communist organization and dates a taxi driver turned gangster . <P> Markovic 's favorite is now Marko , a race-car driver whom she calls " my wild young mustang . " He owns a nightclub called Madona and by his own description loves loud music , women , cars and guns . His racing and gun-toting swagger seem in odd juxtaposition  --  or maybe not  --  to having missed out on military service when recruiters declared him mentally unstable . He is proud of his talent for crashing cars , however  --  30 , at last count . " Daddy used to get angry until my 15th , " Marko told the newsweekly Vreme . " And then he sort of gave up . " <P> The antics of the presidential family are all too visible for Belgrade 's protesters . What angers them most , however , is Milosevic 's invisible transactions . Mladjan Dinkic , an assistant professor of economics at Belgrade University , believes that Milosevic , a former banker , has spirited huge amounts of money out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyprus , where Milosevic 's friend Borka Vucic runs an offshore private bank . The money , argues Dinkic , was extracted from ordinary Serbs during rampant hyperinflation and siphoned to foreign bank accounts from a network of black-market currency vendors and quasi-government banks . Even if that is not true , it seems the Milosevic family values are costly indeed . <P>  --  By Howard Chua-Eoan . Reported by Dejan Anastasijebic/Belgrade
