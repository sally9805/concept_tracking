Preface // Stretching from St. Paul to New Orleans , Mark Twain 's Mississippi winds for twelve hundred miles through fog , rapids , slow eddies , sandbars , bends , and hidden bluffs . Drawing upon his own experiences on the Mississippi , Twain created an image of the river as both physically central to the United States and symbolically central to the progress of the country . The image of the river is also central to the story of our book , which is concerned with the flow of talent  --  particularly of talented black men and women  --  through the country 's system of higher education and on into the marketplace and the larger society . // The image most commonly invoked in discussions of this process is the " pipeline . " We often hear of the importance of keeping young people moving through the " pipeline " from elementary school to high school to college , on through graduate and professional schools , and into jobs , family responsibilities , and civic life . But this image is misleading , with its connotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage . It is more helpful to think of the nurturing of talent as a process akin to moving down a winding river , with rock-strewn rapids and slow channels , muddy at times and clear at others . Particularly when race is involved , there is nothing simple , smooth , or highly predictable about the education of young people . // While riverboat pilots on the Mississippi navigated " point to point "  --  only as far as they could see into the next bend  --  they had to know every depth , every deceptive shoal , and every hidden snag of the river . Moreover , since the boats ran throughout the night , in high water and low , and both up the river and down it , these pilots had to know the river 's features in every imaginable condition , and from either direction . Even though they could only steer through what they saw in front of them , they had to understand how the bend that they were navigating at any moment fit into the shape of a twelve-hundred-mile river . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are similarly complex . Most recently , debate about the use of race as a criterion has centered on the question of who " merits " or " deserves " a place in the freshman class . At this one bend in the river , prior grades and numerical test scores offer a tempting means of defining qualifications , since they are easily compiled and compared . But what do they really tell us , and what are we trying to predict ? Much more , surely , than first-year grades or even graduation from one college or another . It is the contributions that individuals make throughout their lives and the broader impact of higher education on the society that are finally most relevant . // In this book , we seek to be helpful to both the " pilots " of this educational process  --  the parents of prospective students , the high school counselors , college admissions officers , faculty members , and administrators , trustees , and regents responsible for setting policies  --  and those future students who will some day have to navigate the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , legislators , and the public as a whole , since everyone has an interest in the development of talent and access to opportunity in our society . We need to know as much as we can about what has happened around bends and curves  --  in college , in graduate school , and then twenty years downstream  --  from the frozen moment in time when seventeen-year-olds from various races and backgrounds sat down with Number 2 pencils to take the SAT . This book is an attempt to chart what race-sensitive admissions policies have meant over a long stretch of the river  --  both to the individuals who were admitted and to the society that has invested in their education and that counts so heavily on their future leadership . // These questions are enormously important because this country is not yet where any of us would want it to be in terms of race relations . On this central point , liberals and conservatives often agree . Echoing W.E.B . Du Bois , John Hope Franklin has argued eloquently that " the problem of the twenty-first century will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard of measurement or evaluation the problem has not been solved in the twentieth century , and thus becomes a part of the legacy and burden of the next century . " The problem of " the color line " is so central to American life for reasons that are rooted in the disjunction between the values embedded in the Constitution and the realities of three centuries of collective experience . These reasons reflect a sense on the part of many that , despite all the progress made in the past fifty years , we have not yet succeeded in transcending a racial divide that too often discourages the development of ordinary relationships among individuals based on trust and mutual respect . They include as well persistent gross inequities in wealth , privilege , and position that are hard to explain away simply on the basis of differences in individual effort and initiative , significant as such differences are . Finally , there is a collective concern that we are failing to develop to its fullest the human potential of the country and a growing realization that our society , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a democracy if we fail to close the gaps in opportunity that continue to be associated with race . // The subject of race in America is as sensitive and contentious as it is important . Highly charged words , such as " fairness , " " merit , " " achievement , " " preference , " and even " race " itself , often take on very different connotations depending on the speaker and the context . ( Note , for example , the radical differences in polling results when the wording of questions about race is changed in relatively minor ways . ) Language itself has been a casualty of heated debate ; for this reason one aim of this study is to " unpack " the meaning of terms such as " merit , " clarify their various possible meanings , and set forth the consequences of embracing one conception of what they signify rather than another . // Our country respects individual achievement , but it also recognizes that what people have achieved often depends on the families they have grown up in , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have attended , as well as on their own ability and hard work . People rightly seek a society in which racial prejudice no longer limits opportunities . But any close observer of American society can not help but see the many ways in which , covertly and overtly , consciously and unconsciously , actively and as a consequence of inertia , racial differences that have been long in the making continue to thwart aspirations for an open and just society . Words reflect this reality . When an interviewer interested in nomenclature asked the distinguished social psychologist , Kenneth Clark , " What is the best thing for blacks to call themselves , " Clark replied : " White . " THE NATURE OF THIS STUDY // Many Americans are uncomfortable about the use of race as a factor in admitting students to selective colleges and professional schools . Critics have attacked the policy on several grounds . They maintain that it is wrong for universities to exclude white applicants with high grades and impressive test scores while accepting minority applicants with lower grades and scores . They point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disadvantaged but come from wealthier , more privileged homes and better schools than some applicants who are rejected . They claim that all such policies accentuate racial differences , intensify prejudice , and interfere with progress toward a color-blind society . They assert that admitting minority applicants with lower grades and scores may stigmatize and demoralize the very students that the policy attempts to help , by forcing them to compete with classmates of greater academic ability . // Defenders of race-sensitive admissions respond with arguments of their own . They insist that such policies are justified to atone for a legacy of oppression and to make up for continuing discrimination in the society . They point out that admissions officers have long deviated from standardized test scores and prior grades to favor athletes , legacies , and other applicants with special characteristics that are deemed desirable . They argue that admitting a diverse class gives students of all races a better preparation for living and working in an increasingly diverse society . // Until now , the debate has proceeded without much empirical evidence as to the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chapters that follow seek to remedy this deficiency by drawing on an extensive study of students from a number of academically selective colleges and universities  --  places where the debate over race-sensitive institutions has been played out in " real time . " We are concerned primarily with the performance , in college and after college , of black and white students admitted to these schools . // In setting forth the " facts , " as best we can discern them , we recognize that all data of this kind are subject to many interpretations . Moreover , even considering such questions can antagonize people on both sides of the argument who believe that the " right principles " are so compelling that no amount of evidence can change their minds . Plainly , data take us only so far in considering this subject . Individuals who agree on " the facts " may still end up disagreeing about what should be done because of overriding differences in values . As a result , we have no expectation that the analyses presented in this study will resolve complex issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our research can inform the debate by framing questions carefully and presenting what we have learned about outcomes . // Of course , it is widely understood that in framing questions and testing hypotheses , investigators are always influenced by their own values and preconceptions . We know that we have been . It would be disingenuous not to acknowledge that both of us came to this study of race-sensitive admissions with a history of having worked hard , over more than three decades , to enroll and educate more diverse student bodies at two of the country 's best-known universities . This does not mean that we have favored quotas ( we have not ) or that we are unaware of how easy it can be for good intentions to lead people astray . Nor have we ever believed that all colleges or universities  --  including those with which we have been most closely involved  --  have always made the right choices or implemented every policy perfectly . Still , the fact remains that we are both strongly identified with what we regard as responsible efforts to improve educational opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in contemplating this study , we recognized that race-sensitive admissions policies rested on a set of assumptions that had not heretofore been tested empirically . Much basic information was lacking about such topics as the academic performance of minority students with higher and lower test scores in the most selective colleges and universities , the nature and extent of interaction among different races on campus , and the subsequent careers of minority students accepted through race-sensitive policies . When we began the study , we were far from certain what the data would reveal . Quite possibly , some important assumptions underlying the efforts to enroll more minority students would turn out to be unfounded . Nevertheless , we felt that after thirty years , it was surely time to discover the facts , insofar as it was possible to do so . It was important , we thought , to try to understand and come to terms with any disappointing results as well as to learn from positive outcomes . Now that we have completed our study , we can only say that we have learned a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its twists and turns and muddy patches , as well as its occasional brilliant vistas , seems exactly right for describing an educational process that has turned out to be even more subtle and complicated than we had imagined it to be when we began our research . SCOPE OF THE STUDY // This study is limited in several important respects . First , we are concerned solely with higher education . In our view , one problem with much of the debate over affirmative action is that it lumps together a large number of highly disparate areas and programs , ranging from the awarding of contracts to minority-owned businesses to policies governing hiring and promotion to the admissions policies of colleges and universities . The arguments that pertain to one area may or may not apply in other areas . It is noteworthy , for example , that the plaintiffs in the Piscataway case , which centered on the layoff of a white secondary school teacher , took pains in their final brief to ask the Supreme Court not to confuse the job-specific issues that confronted the plaintiff with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations that face educational institutions in deciding whom to admit . // Within the realm of higher education , we are concerned only with academically selective colleges and universities . The main reason is that the debate surrounding race-sensitive admissions is relevant primarily within these institutions . In colleges and professional schools that admit nearly every qualified applicant , there is little to debate ( although there may be arguments over how " qualified " should be defined , and whether the same definition is applied to white and black candidates ) . It is when there are strict limits on the number of places in an entering class and far more qualified applicants than places , that the choices become difficult and the issue of whether to give weight to race comes to the forefront . Many very well-regarded public universities have broadly inclusive admissions policies at the undergraduate level , and the overall number of selective undergraduate schools is much smaller than many people assume ( see Chapter 2 ) . At the graduate and professional level , many schools also take almost every qualified applicant ; however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accredited schools of law and medicine , select their students from an appreciably larger number of qualified candidates . // The scope of our study is limited in a third way : although we include information about Hispanic students , our work focuses principally on whites and African Americans ( whom we usually refer to as " black " ) . We hope that other inquiries will be able to do full justice to the educational experiences of Hispanics along with those of Native Americans and Asian Americans . One reason for focusing on black and white students in this study is that so much of the debate over race-sensitive admissions policies has centered on black-white comparisons . There are also practical considerations . While Hispanics share many of the problems faced by blacks , there are so many differences in cultures , backgrounds , and circumstances within the broad Hispanic category that any rigorous study would need to make more distinctions than are possible within the confines of our database . Native Americans have also endured many handicaps and injustices and have benefited from race-sensitive admissions policies . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly small and does not permit proper statistical analysis in a study of this kind . Thus , however much we would have liked to include comparisons with a variety of groups of Hispanic and Native American matriculants , this was not a practical possibility . // Asian Americans differ from other minorities in important respects . Unlike the case of blacks and Hispanics , the percentage of Asian Americans in selective colleges and universities is far higher than their percentage in the population at large and continues to increase at the institutions included in this study . While there are important and sensitive issues associated with the enrollment of Asian American students ( who , like Hispanics , are themselves highly diverse ) , these are different issues from those that confront admissions offices in considering black candidates . // Finally , our study addresses issues of educational policy . Our objective is not to analyze the development of constitutional law , the proper interpretation of civil rights legislation , or the present holdings of the courts in these areas . We are concerned with the admissions policies that colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . THE COLLEGE AND BEYOND DATABASE // Much of the new content in this study derives from exploitation of a rich database called College and Beyond ( C&amp;B ) . This database was built by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation over nearly four years ( from the end of 1994 through 1997 ) as a part of the Foundation 's broader interest in supporting research in higher education . A full explanation of its construction and its components , including links to data compiled by other researchers , is contained in Appendix A. In brief , the part of the database used in this study contains the records of more than eighty thousand undergraduate students who matriculated at twenty-eight academically selective colleges and universities in the fall of 1951 , the fall of 1976 , and the fall of 1989 . Created on the explicit understanding that the Foundation would not release or publish data that identified either individual students or individual schools , it is a " restricted access database . " // The " in-college " component of the database was compiled from individual student records in collaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student ( except those few cases where records had been lost or were incomplete ) , the database contains information available at the time the student was admitted , including race , gender , test scores , rank in high school class , and , for many students , information about family background . It also includes records of academic performance in college , compiled mainly from transcripts , which have been linked to the admissions data . Each student record was coded to indicate graduation status ( when and if the student graduated ) , major field of study , grade point average , and whether the student participated in athletics or other time-intensive extracurricular activities . // For many of these same matriculants , we also have extensive survey data describing their subsequent histories ( advanced degrees earned , sector of employment , occupation , earned income and family income , involvement in civic activities , marital status and number of children ) . The respondents were also asked to provide information about where else they applied to college , where they were admitted , whether they did or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assess their experiences in college , and how satisfied they have been with their lives after college . Finally , for the ' 89 matriculants only , the survey sought information on the extent to which they interacted ( during college and since college ) with individuals of different races , political outlooks , socioeconomic backgrounds , and geographic origins . The individuals contacted through the survey were extraordinarily cooperative : the overall sample response rates were 80 percent for the ' 76 matriculants and 84 percent for the ' 89 matriculants ( Appendix A ) . // The twenty-eight colleges and universities whose matriculants are included in the C&amp;B database are : Liberal Arts Colleges // Barnard College // Bryn Mawr College // Denison University // Hamilton College // Kenyon College // Oberlin College // Smith College // Swarthmore College // Wellesley College // Wesleyan University // Williams College // Research Universities // Columbia University // Duke University // Emory University // Miami University ( Ohio ) // Northwestern University // Pennsylvania State University // Princeton University // Rice University // Stanford University // Tufts University // Tulane University // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina at Chapel Hill // University of Pennsylvania // Vanderbilt University // Washington University // Yale University //
