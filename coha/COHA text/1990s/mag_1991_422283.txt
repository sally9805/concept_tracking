Section : U.S. News Finally , somebody has asked inner-city residents themselves for answers <p> Every Sunday-school child knows that Jesus said the poor are always with us . But not even the Christian Messiah detailed why the poor endure , much less why so many chronically poor urbanites would one day be black or Puerto Rican . In recent decades , Americans have debated the whys of ghetto poverty across dinner tables and bar stools , at academic panels and presidential press conferences , all the while lacking one central piece of evidence  --  the real-world testimony of inner-city residents . That guessing game stemmed largely from an unfortunate research hiatus : After Daniel Patrick Moynihan 's 1965 report on the black family drew the ire of civil-rights leaders for " blaming the victim , " policy makers and academicians virtually stopped conducting large-scale , ethnographic surveys of inner-city neighborhoods . <p> The ignorance gap narrowed appreciably last week when University of Chicago sociologist William Julius Wilson and a team of colleagues presented the results of a study of 2,490 residents of Chicago 's inner-city neighborhoods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ricans , 400 Mexicans and 187 local employers of inner-city labor . Just as important  --  and unusual  --  were the months of follow-up interviews conducted by Wilson 's ethnographers with a smaller group of black , Mexican and Puerto Rican residents . Their tales reveal numerous inadequacies in the theories about ghetto poverty and a trove of insights into the daily lives of inner-city minorities . <p> In particular , they help illuminate perhaps the most central dispute over the ghetto poor : Has the post-1960s growth of a small but expensive underclass resulted from structural problems such as discrimination , disappearing jobs and the flight of the black middle class or from cultural changes and ethnic influences ? The Wilson team 's examination of the causes of chronic joblessness , marital breakdown and welfare dependency shows that liberal and conservative explanations are both partly true , yet by themselves , inadequate . For instance , the research showed that jobless black parents are more vulnerable than other inner-city ethnics to plant shutdowns and automation , but such " structural " reasons accounted for only about a fifth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential flaw of the current theories , whether they focus on behavioral or structural causes of chronic poverty , is that they generally fail to recognize the heterogeneity of the slums and how individuals change over time . Several of Wilson 's researchers found that the job status of ghetto residents often shifted from year to year  --  as did their reasons for taking or abandoning jobs . " We need a broader vision , " says Wilson , " of the processes that affect a poor person 's chances . ' Ethnographer Robert L. Laseter adds : " Black males in the inner city do n't just fit either-or propositions . ' Among the other insights : <p> TABLE <p> The Chicago survey shows that inner-city blacks , Mexicans and Puerto Ricans believe in the American dream . Respondents wanted decent , steady jobs and houses of their own , and they generally disdained welfare . But repeated follow-up interviews showed that inner-city blacks who hold jobs often doubt that unemployed ghetto residents are truly committed to finding work or supporting their children . In fact , their criticisms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or black conservatives made the same assertions , they would most likely be branded as racists or Uncle Toms . <p> Repeatedly , black respondents told ethnographers that their unemployed friends were " lazy " and questioned the diligence of those who quit jobs or had been fired . " Michael , " for example , said that most of his friends do n't want jobs " where they have to go leave their homeys or leave their friends . ' He mentioned how several jobless friends failed to even apply for temporary slots at a downtown food festival after he arranged to have them hired . " Clive " summed up a typical criticism when he claimed that many " black males do n't want to work , and when I say do n't want to work , I say do n't want to work hard . They want a real easy job , making big bucks . ' <p> Black women and men in the inner city were only slightly less scornful of their peers when it came to children and marriage . Richard Taub , one of Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men as exploitative and untrustworthy . ... Conversely , the men worry that if they have money , women will bleed them dry . ' Generally , ghetto males felt little or no obligation to marry the mothers of their children , preferring instead to chase other women and hang out with their buddies . Several men candidly talked about " Mother 's Day , " when men temporarily cozy up to ex-girlfriends after the monthly welfare check arrives . The cars line up outside the projects , said one , " about 9 in the morning . By 4 that evening , they gone . ' <p> Joleen Kirschenman , research director for Wilson 's study , minimizes these criticisms , saying that working-class blacks censured jobless blacks largely because they feared their behavior " would reflect badly on them . " Wilson and Kirschenman also point out that one reason marriage has declined so precipitously in the ghetto is that shifts in urban , low-wage labor markets have made it difficult for black men to find work  --  and jobless men , naturally , do not make alluring marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner-city blacks are prepared to " blame the victim " rather than " the system . " In fact , many of those in the field studies talk far more readily about the importance of individual character , morals and culture than most of the scholars who write about the urban underclass . If anything , the ethos of individualism may be even more marked in the inner city than outside it . Ethnographer Marilyn Krogh , who did fieldwork in a Puerto Rican area of Chicago , was struck " by how relentlessly teachers and administrators warned kids about the importance of achievement , education and staying away from drugs . In a middle-class community , you wo n't likely hear a Sunday sermon on how it 's up to you to be a success  --  but you hear that message ad nauseam in the inner city . ' <p> TABLE <p> Many news accounts depict ghettos as dangerous , almost exotic neighborhoods rife with Uzi-toting gang enforcers , crack-crazed moms who abandon their children and teens who ruthlessly gun down their peers on crowded playgrounds . Desperate characters do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's safety . Yet day to day , says Krogh , " the people I spoke to were bored . There was an odd combination of hustling to pay the bills , locate sales , call around for a ride or borrow some medicine  --  and an awful lot of tedium . ' Inside ghetto apartments , televisions often drone much of the day , with soap operas serving as a prime diversion . And on the street , the braggadocio of young men seems inversely proportional to the availability of recreational outlets like playgrounds and parks . Once thriving business strips are now desolate , too . <p> TABLE <p> The least-educated ethnic group in Chicago 's inner city and the one least likely to speak English  --  Mexican immigrants  --  is also the one most likely to hold jobs . The differences between Mexican and black fathers are especially dramatic . Whereas only half of inner-city black fathers who dropped out of high school worked at the time of the Chicago survey , more than 90 percent of their Mexican counterparts did so . That gap reflects several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful blacks move out of inner cities  --  and Mexicans are more likely than blacks to be married or have other adults around to help with child care and household duties . <p> Even so , the attitudes of low-income Mexican fathers plainly account for part of their stronger work ethic . Nearly 75 percent of inner-city black fathers thought people had a right to receive public aid without working ; just 33 percent of the Mexican dads agreed . Professor Taub reported that the Mexicans " were demons for work , with many of the men holding two jobs . ' One Mexican father even said " how lucky he was because he had full-time work during the Christmas holidays . ' <p> TABLE <p> As the example of the Mexicans suggests , the inner-city job market is far from a pure meritocracy . Black leaders have long contended that Mexicans and other ethnic immigrants rise in part because they do not face severe color discrimination , yet the explosive growth of the black middle class since the mid-1960s has made it harder to document modern-day racism by employers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination by employers against low-income blacks persists , but in a different , subtler form . <p> In effect , employers of low-wage workers now rely on class and race " markers " in a job applicant 's speech , home address , manner and dress  --  " dangly earrings " were disapprovingly cited by one employer  --  in their hiring decisions . Many employers presume that inner-city blacks are likely to be unproductive ; 40 percent said that black workers had a bad attitude toward work , were apathetic or arrogant . These employers , moreover , generally did not believe they were racist ; instead , they repeatedly cited their support for " good " black employees and contended their negative expectations of lower-class black workers were based on personal experience . Not surprisingly , black workers found hiring decisions capricious , and said they reflected personal connections , patience and luck more than demonstrable skills . <p> Surprisingly , low-income blacks seeking work in the inner city may actually hurt their chances of finding jobs by enrolling in government training initiatives . Just 11 of 152 firms surveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . Instead , as sociologist Deirdre Alexia Royster shows , employers mistakenly presumed that blacks who resorted to training programs were not able " to ' cut it ' on their own and represented the ' welfare poor . ' ' <p> Overall , the impact of culture and ethnicity in Chicago 's low-income areas suggests a few cautionary notes about raising excessive expectations of government policy . Ethnographer Laseter asked a number of black inner-city men " what would happen if the government came in and gave everybody in the community a job ? ' He said " the almost universal answer " he received " was that a subset of guys  --  not the majority of black men  --  would n't take a job no matter what you did for them . ' <p> Reversing cynical attitudes toward marriage may prove just as daunting . " Anybody would be foolish to claim that if you create jobs in the ghetto , people will marry and everything will be fine , ' says Sophie Pedder , a former research assistant of Wilson 's . " It 's perfectly obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they will continue to say ' I can have more fun unattached . ' Without a stronger moral environment , it 's hard to see why the young men will act differently . ' <p> In one sense , re-creating a more moral environment in the inner city may not be as implausible as it sounds . It is true , as Wilson notes , that many upwardly mobile blacks have moved out of the ghetto , reducing the number of healthy role models left behind . But few social scientists believe that cultural mores are immutable , passed from generation to generation . In fact , the problems of chronic black joblessness and unwed motherhood are of comparatively recent vintage : Before 1950 , marriage rates among young couples were actually higher for blacks than for whites , and labor force participation rates for young black males generally exceeded those of young whites until about 1970 . Yet politicians have largely ignored the fact that cultural trends outside the ghetto , such as a rise in sexual promiscuity , the decline of organized religion , an increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a doubly deleterious impact on the poor . When parents are readier to " do the right thing , " both inside and outside the ghetto , their children will surely benefit as well . <p> Photo : Teenage mom .
