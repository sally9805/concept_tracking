<p> If you want the lowest price on a car but do n't want to haggle with a salesman , this should come as good news : you do n't have to . Haggling with a pro , no matter how good you are , is not the best way to get a deal . Nor do you have to put your fate in the hands of an auto broker who claims special buying privileges or a great new buying system . <p> Most car buying tips are complicated explanations of how cars are priced and how car dealers make money . Such information may or may not be accurate , but either way , it gives you little more leverage over a dealer than you had to start with . After all , only the dealer knows how far he 's willing to go to sell a car and only the forces of market competition can , or should , force him to that limit . <p> So how do you put competition to work for yourself on the showroom floor ? You take bids . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a non-profit organization in Washington , D.C. , has shown that competitive bidding results in the lowest price , nine times out of ten . For the past 15 years , the Center has published ratings and price information on auto repair shops , hospitals , plumbers , banks , and other services in the Washington , D.C. and San Francisco areas and has been instructing area consumers on how to get competitive prices on goods and services . With this expertise , it recently developed its method for soliciting bids from car dealers . <p> Taking Bids <p> Although the center offers a car buying service , called CarBargains , there 's nothing in its buying system that you ca n't do yourself . <p> First , you must be willing to spend the time to get at least five bids . The bids should be solicited blindly-meaning no dealer knows another dealer 's offer-by telephone , so you save time and do n't get the run-around at the lot . Each dealer should be asked to submit the bid to you in writing , so there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you go to buy the car . <p> The Center offers the following advice for consumers who wish to put the bid method to work : <p> Find out the factory invoice cost of the car you want to buy - the base cost and the cost for options you might consider . There are various sources for this information available in bookstores or through the mail . ( CSS can assist you with acquiring this information even if you do not use their service , see box page 22 . ) <p> Robert Krughoff , president of CSS , says car dealers have several ways of making money on car sales . Some money-making aspects of a sale , such as factory " holdbacks " and factory-to-dealer incentives , are not reflected in the factory invoice but can give a dealer substantial room for deal making . <p> A high factory incentive makes it possible for a dealer to profit selling a car even below invoice . High incentives are sometimes offered on lines of cars that the company has had trouble selling . The dealer incentive is lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular car might not look that great when compared to the factory invoice . <p> Call various dealers and invite them to quote the markup or markdown they will accept relative to the factory invoice cost for the make , model , and style car you want on the dealer 's lot . Talk with the sales manager at each dealership . Explain that you are getting bids from at least four other dealers and that each will have just one chance to bid . Be sure to get a clear understanding of whether the dealer is including the destination charge , dealer advertising association fee , and any other charges in the invoice cost . <p> CarBargains asks for one round of blind bids and suggests that consumers who do it themselves use the same method . Making it clear that only one round of bids will be taken makes the dealers take the process seriously and give their most competitive bid immediately , rather than playing games and waiting to get serious in another round of bidding . <p> " They know they will have one chance to bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be competing against other bids and if they want the business they are going to have to bid as low as they can afford to . " <p> A customer using the bidding service or doing it by himself can take a written bid to the dealer who quoted it and buy the car . But if the customer wants to try for an even better deal , he can take the bid around to other dealers , show it to them , and ask if they will beat it . Find out whether there are any required addons - like preparation fees or such dealer-installed options as rustproofing and paint sealant , which are usually overpriced . This way , you wo n't be surprised with unwanted options and costs at the lot . Keep trade-in , financing , extended service contract , and other related items out of the new car sales price comparison . You should find out the best deal you can get on each of these separately by shopping around-at banks for financing , for example-before discussing them with the dealer where you will buy your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new car , use the other prices on the financing , trade-in , and other related items to negotiate with your dealer further , or simply do business with the other vendors on these related items . <p> What About Brokers ? <p> If you hate wheeling and dealing but like good deals , you can always turn to an auto broker . But whether you will actually get a good deal is questionable . Many brokering services are offered by credit unions , banks , discount clubs , and auto clubs such as the American Automobile Association . Some services are designed only to steer customers to a particular lender or dealer . <p> Most auto brokers throughout the country do not operate by taking bids from an array of dealers . Many actually work for a group of dealers sometimes even a single dealer-or try to find troubled dealerships that are willing to settle for less profit to move cars . <p> But unless the broker gives you a handful of bids , you wo n't know whether he got you the best deal . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal you got with a broker is to take bids from dealers and compare them to the price offered by the broker , at which point you would be better off doing the shopping yourself . <p> " Many services sell factory-invoice cost printouts that are supposed to help you negotiate for a car , " Krughoff says . " But because of ' holdbacks , ' factory-to-dealer incentives , and other allowances , these printouts do n't tell you what the cost to the dealer really is . More important , even with one of these printouts , you are on your own to figure out what is a reasonable markup and to get a dealer to agree to that markup . <p> " There are also services that promise to find you a good deal from one of a list of precommitted dealers , " says Krughoff . " Some of these services get commissions or other financial benefits from their selected dealers . Even if such financial arrangements do n't exist , there 's a good chance that the dealers affiliated with these services wo n't be those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Non-affiliated dealers may be getting larger cash incentive payments from the manufacturer , may have excess stock of the kind of car you want , or may simply be willing to accept a lower profit . " <p> In contrast to these , the CarBargains method , because it has no ties with any dealer , finds the best prices dealers have at any moment . <p> CarBargains boasts that bidding 's superiority was proved recently when Price Club membership warehouse stores were steering San Francisco area Toyota Camry customers to a local dealer that had committed to prices $399 above invoice for Price Club members . At the same time , CarBargains was getting bids for Camry customers in that area for $600 below invoice , $999 less than the Price Club members were paying . <p> There are some other advantages with soliciting bids . By bidding , or using a bidding service , you end up dealing directly with the dealer who is selling the car . Using a car broker , your car may come from a dealer thousands of miles away and be delivered for pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances this has caused trouble for customers when they want a local dealer to honor the service contract . <p> " Some customers who bring their supposedly new vehicle in for dealer service learn to their unpleasant surprise that the dealer , having taken delivery of a brokered unit , legally was the original owner , " says an article in Ward 's Auto Dealer magazine . <p> Because of this , and the fact brokered vehicles are often shipped around the country before reaching a consumer , auto manufacturers worry that tracking the owner of a brokered vehicle might be difficult in the event of a safety recall . <p> And some car dealers , chagrined about lost profits due to the competitive nature of auto brokering , have been lobbying for restrictions on these services . Using arguments about problems with titles and service , as mentioned above , they 've managed to get laws passed to make car brokering illegal in several states , including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Arkansas , Texas , and Kansas . And attempts to outlaw car brokering in other states are ongoing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in each instance the service has been exonerated by a judge 's opinion . <p> ILLUSTRATION : Wallet <p> By Wayne Laugesen <p> <p> Mr. Laugesen is managing editor of CR . <p> LET AN EXPERT BID FOR YOU ? <p> Although someone who wants to spend the time can take bids himself , there may be some advantages to paying the $96 to CarBargains , or a similar service . According to CarBargains , the advantages of using their service over doing it yourself include : Dealers know the service will actually get at least five quotes . In addition , they know that a consumer who has paid for the CarBargains service is almost certain to buy from one of the quoting dealers , so refusing to quote means losing any chance at the customer . Dealers know the service will get good bids from other dealers . The service reminds dealers of any ongoing factory-to-dealer incentive programs , manufacturer holdbacks , and other factors that give the dealer room to cut its price . Also , dealers know that the CarBargains service employs people familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get the best price locally , it will get prices from out-of-area dealers who will deliver locally . Because the service is constantly taking bids , it knows which dealers tend to give low quotes . In many cases , CarBargains knows which personnel in each dealership have the authority to commit the dealership to low quotes and will be able to handle the final sale smoothly . The service is a witness to each quote , and the dealers know they will follow up . In contrast , a dealer may be more likely to back out of a quote it gave to a customer by phone . <p> The service works like this : The customer tells CarBargains the make , model and style of car he plans to buy . Within two weeks , the service gets at least five dealers in the customer 's area to bid against one another to sell that make , model , and style . ( Although five bids are guaranteed , the service frequently gets as many as 15 bids for a customer . ) Each dealer commits to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost " for which it will sell the type of car the customer wants . CarBargains sends the customer a factory invoice cost printout  --  which shows how much all dealers pay for the base car and each available option  --  and dealer quote sheets , which show at how much above or below factory invoice cost each dealer has agreed to sell . The quote sheets also identify the sales managers responsible for honoring the commitments . The customer visits one or more dealerships and : Selects the specific car he wants . Uses the factory invoice cost printout to add up the factory invoice cost for the base car plus all the options on the car selected . Sees the sales manager listed on the dealer quote sheet and buys the car at the factory invoice cost plus , or minus , the amount above or below invoice cost that the dealer has agreed to sell for . <p> If a car with the options a customer wants is not available on a dealer 's lot , the customer can have the dealer order the car from the factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markdown , figure . <p> CarBargains operates nationally with the toll free number ( 800 ) 475-7283 . <p>
