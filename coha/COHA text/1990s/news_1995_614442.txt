<p> This is about the dream vacation our cat tried to chew up . The hissy little kitty we call Hillary did n't go with my wife and me to California - we 're not that stupid . But she was there in spirit as surely as if she 'd been biting the flight attendant 's ankles . If only it had been their ankles ... <p> But more on that later . <p> Pam and I went west for a driving adventure . Georgia has such boringly good roads - smooth surfaces , gentle grades , curves as easy as a rainbow - that sometimes you just want to haul off and hurtle over a cliff like Thelma and Louise . This can be arranged in California . Compared with Georgia , the terrain is spectacularly impolite . That 's what we wanted - a rude drive , where the road wriggles like a sidewinder , where one shoulder is rock and the other is sky , where they have highway signs you never see back home : Rock Slide . Wave Alert . Flying Reindeer ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In short , we wanted a road like the Pacific Coast Highway . It hugs the rim of the continent for 1,500 miles from San Diego to Seattle , past foamy beaches , over rocky inlets , atop dizzying cliffs , through hushed redwood forests , across the Golden Gate and the Columbia River and on to Puget Sound . It 's a scream machine of a road , the bluest of blue highways . <p> So we left Atlanta with our maps , guidebooks and hiking boots , flueled by visions of breathtaking scenery and soul-salving strolls through ancient woods . We flew into Los Angeles , fetched a rental car and took Sunset Boulevard straight to the sunset at Malibu . <p> Calif. 1 , as the highway is designated for much of its length , is n't at its best here . On one side , the walled-off beach homes of the stars block the surf from view . On the other , rock-slide hills rise like slag heaps . We could n't wait to get out of L.A. ' orbit . <p> It was a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Luis Obispo , the largest town on the sparsely populated central California coast . We stayed the night and lit out the next morning for San Simeon , where William Randolph Hearst built one of the world 's great mansions atop a seaside mountain . <p> We were touring the press lord 's gaudy pleasure dome - Willie World , Pam and I called it - when I first felt the aching . My left ankle was swelling . I took a seat in the visitors ' center and noticed an angry red splotch the size of a raspberry on my left calf . I knew instantly . <p> Hillary ! <p> Hillary is the younger of our two cats . A high-strung 2-year-old of the tortoise-shell variety , she takes it personally when we lay out the suitcases and signal our intention to leave her unamused for even a day . As we packed for California , she sidled up to me , meowed in protest and sunk her hypodermic fangs into my leg . I yelped , swatted her with a T- shirt and forgot about it - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we continued north , my bare foot propped on the dash like Huck Finn in a rental car . I stopped whining about the pain when we passed a sign warning of rock slides for the next 60 miles . The road rose and the shore dropped away , and soon we were negotiating one sharp turn after another as we headed out to sea on the edge of a cliff and looped back landward to cross a bridge high above a boulder-strewn cove . Every inch of highway flashed silver with battered guardrail . <p> Onward bound <p> We were entering Big Sur , the rugged country that may be America 's most dramatic coastline . L.A. and San Francisco so dominate our image of California that we sometimes forget how isolated much of the state is . Big Sur is isolated . It took 18 years for convict labor gangs to build this highway . You wonder how they did it so quickly when you see the scalloped topography they had to traverse . They finished the job in 1937 , only it 's never really finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring brings road crews to repair and rebuild . The asphalt looks sutured . <p> Big Sur , we noticed , has its own fan club . Every turnout seems to have a camper with an aging hippie sitting in a lawn chair gazing serenely out to sea . We had read about one of them , Cosmo , an elderly man who roams the coast in an old Winnebago . I think we passed him in a beach chair , playing conga drums as the sun split for the other side of the globe . <p> It was getting dark when we pulled into Monterey . Instead of heading down to Cannery Row and the Steinbeck Wax Museum , we searched out an after-hours clinic to examine my ankle . The doctor 's diagnosis ? Cat- scratch fever . And I thought it was just a Ted Nugent song . <p> " It 's a serious infection if you do n't treat it , " the doctor warned . " Stay off your feet . " <p> " But we 're on vacation , " I objected . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do it from your car , " he ordered , puncturing my arm with a tetanus shot . <p> There was one more bit of unpleasantness that evening . When we went to fill my prescription , the druggist mentioned as a casual afterthought that the antibiotic was so strong , it 'd probably kill all my stomach bacteria and give me a gut-wrenching case of diarrhea . <p> Great , I thought , envisioning myself deep in a redwood forest , cramped and club-footed , with nothing but needles and cones at my disposal . Pam asked whether there was anything I could do . <p> " Eat lots of yogurt with active cultures , " the druggist said . We dined that evening at a Safeway supermarket . <p> Come morning , my worst fears unrealized , we set out to explore Carmel and Pebble Beach , the wind-swept tip of the Monterey Peninsula . When John Steinbeck visited his old stomping grounds in the early ' 60s , he found the area as beautiful as ever but changed . It was becoming an enclave for the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country-club community that would probably arrest its founding fathers , should they return , as suspicious vagrants . <p> Today the founders would have to pay to look around . It costs $ 6.50 to take t he famous 17-mile drive along Pebble Beach and the magnificent golf courses everyone has admired on TV thanks to Bing Crosby . I hopped about the beaches like a one-legged crane , snapping pictures of gulls and sea lions and spooky gnarled cypresses . One tree actually had a sign next to it prohibiting commercial reproduction of the image because it 's a real estate company 's logo . I wondered if we 'd have to surrender our camera at the exit gate . <p> On to San Francisco <p> We left Monterey that afternoon and traced the serpentine shoreline 150 miles north to San Francisco , where we spent a couple of nights . You do n't often hear about the seaward side of the city because San Francisco faces the bay and turns its back on the Pacific . It was quieter out where the pastel town houses end their hilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Funston , where hang gliders hovered above the ocean , and watched Japanese tourists climb into artillery bunkers built for the World War II invasion that never came . <p> From there , the highway funneled onto the Golden Gate Bridge , that vast orange linchpin that holds California together . We parked on the north side and walked back across , noticing the phones labeled as crisis counseling lines . Over the years , hundreds of people have leaped through fog and despair to their deaths here . Limping along , I thought about a cat I 'd like to add to their number . <p> California is a different country above the Golden Gate . Once we cleared the hot-tub suburbs of Marin County , development thinned out and the air smelled as sweet as a cedar chest . We knew we had entered a different country of the mind , too , when we came to the place where the Bolinas cutoff was supposed to be . The residents of this small coastal town do n't want tourist traffic and keep tearing down directional signs to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marker with a chiseled question mark called the Shrine of the Unknown Tourist . We would n't know ; we never found the place . <p> We pressed on that afternoon until we came to Mendocino , a lumber town turned artists colony , where we dined at a sidewalk cafe highly recommended by the town 's large stray cat population . ( Cats . . . grrr . ) After our customary dessert of yogurt with active cultures , we walked to the Mendocino Headlands , a park atop a precipice at the end of Main Street , where we watched the sun sink into a calm sea . <p> Follow the water <p> We later learned how deceptive the ocean can be . It was here a few months later that a brother and sister scattering their mother 's ashes were swept away by a sudden wave . He escaped . She did n't . Her body was found blue and bloody among the jagged rocks below . <p> We continued along the water 's edge the next morning . Then the highway veered inland , missing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too rough for even this road to venture . Calif. 1 disappeared into U.S. 101 and zigzagged through the wild back country of Humboldt County , known for its logging and marijuana growing . At the Eel River Cafe in Garberville , where we stopped for sourdough French toast , the farmers threw us shifty glances that made us glad we were just passing through . " I do n't think we 've seen a cop since San Francisco , " Pam whispered . <p> Soon we were in the redwood country , experiencing the eerie awe of being in the presence of something much older and greater than we are . Steinbeck felt it as well : " To me there 's a remote and cloistered feeling here . One holds back speech for fear of disturbing something - what ? From my earliest childhood I 've felt that something was going on in the groves , something of which I was not a part . " <p> Of course , the redwood country has its ticky-tack side as well . Outside the parklands we saw drive-through trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from burl , a sort of gnarly tree wart . The weirdest sight had to be Trees of Mystery , a roadside attraction marked by huge statues of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox . They materialized in the late afternoon fog like Bigfoot and his dog . We almost ran off the highway . <p> Fog became our constant companion as we crossed the Oregon border and pulled into the town of Brookings for the night . The southern Oregon coast is said to be beautiful , but we could n't tell ; the next morning 's fog did n't lift until we stopped many miles north to admire the endless white dunes near Coos Bay . <p> Our favorite place in Oregon , without a doubt , was Sea Lion Caves . We had seen the attraction advertised on countless bumper stickers and figured it was the Pacific Northwest 's equivalent of Rock City . We were right . The place sits on a cliff so far above the surf , we figured you could see as many states as you can from Lookout Mountain . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the core of the cliff . We emerged in the salty mist of a cave , the concussion of crashing waves and the confusion of barking sea lions filling our ears . Pam hurried toward the fence that separated us from the animals - she was Joan Embry in an earlier life - and suddenly recoiled . My God , the smell ! It was like a wrestler 's armpit with a little wino 's surprise thrown in . We bravely held our noses and continued the wildlife study . <p> We pressed northward past the chain of state parks that protects the Oregon shore from development . For the most part , it 's a less theatrical coast than California 's - beautiful , but less extreme . We made it all the way to Seaside , the state 's biggest beach resort , before pulling over for the night . <p> It was a short drive the next day to Astoria . The first American outpost on the West Coast , the city was founded in 1811 as a fort to guard John Jacob Astor 's fur trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark expedition reached the Pacific near here . <p> On a hill overlooking the town and the miles-wide mouth of the Columbia River stands the Astoria Column , an observation tower covered like a totem pole with symbolic murals . Pam and I climbed to the top and beheld the mighty mingling of waters . Then I realized something : For the first time in a thousand miles , my left foot was n't aching . The antibiotics were working . <p> Maybe I would n't skin that cat after all . Maybe . Chart : If you drive the coast Getting there : The major points of entry to the Pacific Coast Highway are Los Angeles and San Francisco . To make the full drive , as we did , you 'll have to fly to Los Angeles and back from Seattle . It cost us $ 298 round trip last fall on Continental . That airline now quotes $ 442 , Delta $ 471 . Shop around ; you may catch a special . Driving the route : It 'll cost at least $ 300 to rent a compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy the drive between Los Angeles and Seattle . Some companies have drop-off charges and lower rates , some have higher rates and no drop-off charge . Avis , Hertz , National and Alamo all come out between $ 300 and $ 400 . Be sure to check road conditions before going . As last winter 's storms showed , rain and mudslides can close long stretches of the highway .
