Beginning pastelists paint more boldly when they appreciate the medium 's opacity and forgiving nature . <p> I teach classes and workshops on pastels and have found that most beginners are too timid . Understandably , they are afraid of making mistakes and therefore proceed gently and cautiously . Sooner or later , however , it 's time to explore the full potential of pastel and act boldly . But doing so requires confidence , which likewise requires experience . So , I encourage my students to make mistakes and learn from them . They soon discover that pastel is a forgiving medium . <p> Pastel , in fact , is well-suited to beginners because it can be manipulated and corrected countless times . One of the most wonderful characteristics of pastel is its opacity , which allows an artist to cover previous layers of pigment with clear and vibrant color . False strokes or mistakes can be adjusted with relative ease , which is what I show in the step-by-step demonstration on these pages . <p> Pastel is pure pigment mixed with a dry binder ( gum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When applied to a surface with a receptive texture , such as rough paper , sanded paper , or abrasive board , the colored pigment becomes embedded in the tiny crevices , the " tooth " of the paper . The only limitation to developing an image comes from creating so thick a buildup of pastel that the paper 's tooth can not hold any more pigment . Therefore , it 's important not to overwork a painting . <p> To prevent going too far , however , most beginners do n't go far enough . My advice is to learn this boundary by deliberately overworking one or two paintings . Doing so will help you realize that you can apply much more pastel than you think is possible . Also , you will learn to recognize the warning signs of saturation . <p> There are even ways to regain some workability with an image once you 've gone too far . Try removing some pastel with a stiff bristle brush or a toothbrush . Sometimes a kneaded eraser can lift a bit of pigment without disturbing much of the design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for scraping away unwanted areas , provided you do n't scrape too hard . One of the most useful pastel accessories I 've discovered is a can of compressed air , which is available at most camera stores . It sends a precise blast of air through a thin nozzle to any area of your painting that needs correction . The force of air easily removes unwanted strokes of pastel , restoring the original tooth of the paper . Be careful not to inhale the dust , however . <p> The demonstration shown here is a typical exercise from my workshops , and it proves my point that pastel is a forgiving medium . I begin by painting a simple blue square with a green background . I then paint a pale violet triangle and brickcolored background on top of the previous layer . I do n't cover the square completely so that the students can see what lies beneath . Next , I paint a new background and pyramid over the triangle , keeping the coverage loose in order to reveal the underlying shapes . <p> In the next step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the previous layers . There is absolutely no relationship planned between it and the geometric shapes . As a result , students see how they can boldly apply several layers of pastel on top of one another as they define a composition . As the landscape gradually takes form , I loosely block in the shapes and change them when necessary . Notice how I laid in the sky and developed the trees to a progressively sharper definition . <p> I use many brands of pastels of differing strength , and I select them according to my needs at the time . Generally , I apply harder pastels such as Nupastel or Sakura first because they deposit a thinner layer of pigment on the paper . As I progress , I use increasingly softer sticks , such as Rembrandt or Grumbacher , then Daler-Rowney , Winsor &; Newton , or Sennelier . Some brands , such as Schmincke , are so soft that I use them only for rich , velvety final touches . <p> As I work , I usually weave my colors in several layers , none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can work back and forth all over the composition and allow the image to develop . This process and its effect remind me of a tweed sports coat I own that appears to be a neutral gray from a distance but actually contains a great number of blue , green , yellow , and red fibers . Likewise , if you closely examine any printed illustration you will see that it is composed of many yellow , magenta , cyan , and black dots . The proportion of these dots in any area produces the particular color in the shape . An orange shape may have some blue or black dots , for example , but it will have mostly yellow and magenta ones . By weaving various strokes of pastel throughout a painting you can convey colored shapes and create color harmony within the composition at the same time . Varying the proportion of the colors will also provide dominant or subordinate areas of emphasis . <p> Beginners should remember some basic principles of pastel painting . First , a wide assortment of pastels is essential , including different values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark shades . Any basic set should be augmented with some individual sticks of your favorite colors in other brands . Second , apply soft over hard pastels . Third , work in light colors over dark ones . This rule is n't always applicable , but it is especially effective for depicting the sensation of light falling upon objects . Light colors cover dark ones well , but sometimes a dark color placed on top looks muddy . Fourth , avoid the temptation to blend colors with your fingers . From time to time it may be all right , but generally it is better to strive for clear , unblended color . The intensity of pastel pigment is part of its character , and too much rubbing and blending diminishes the color 's purity . <p> The vibrant colors of pastel and their direct application makes the medium an especially pleasurable one to use . Once beginners understand that pastels can be layered and manipulated so that mistakes are hidden , the medium seems all the more friendly . The confidence that comes from that notion is all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FORMS <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 1 . To prove that pastel pigments are opaque and can easily cover mistakes , I began my painting with a simple blue square with a green background . Over the course of the demonstration , I altered and covered it until it had no relationship with the final artwork . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 2 . I painted a pale violet triangle and brick-colored background on top of the previous layer . I did n't cover the square completely to allow the students to see the underlying layers . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 3 . I painted a new background and pyramid over the shapes of the second step . Once again , I kept the coverage loose in order to reveal the underlying shapes . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 4 . Here , I began to lay in a landscape . There is no relationship between it and the geometric shapes . I applied several layers of pastel as I began to define my composition . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shapes were blocked in loosely and changed when necessary . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 6 . A layer of sky in this step defined the contour of the treetops . I placed a few dark shapes throughout the scene for contrast . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 7 . I applied another layer of sky and some midvalue color over some of the darks . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 8 . I laid in a third layer of sky with some high-value strokes in the foreground . I then further developed the trees . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 9 . As the painting approached completion , I adjusted the values and more sharply defined the forms . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Notice how thick and painterly my pastel strokes were . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 10 . As a final step , I determined the tree trunk at the left rear was too bright and warm , which made it more dominant than I thought it should be . I therefore changed its color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the foreground . The completed painting : Tree Forms , 1999 , pastel on sanded paper , 9 x 12 .
