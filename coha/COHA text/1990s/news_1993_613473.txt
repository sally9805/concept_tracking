<p> Imagine a blood-sucking invader with superhuman strength and near- invincible armor and you 've just described the flea . <p> In August , the month when flea populations peak , the Southeast hops with these little hard-to-kill vampires . <p> Because of mild winters and this season 's high temperatures , " fleas have been pretty bad this summer , " says Anne Rambo , co-owner of Cheshire Pet Supply . " The dry weather should have reduced the number , but it does n't seem to have had much effect . Now , with the rain coming , they should be just blooming . " <p> Kathy Richardson , a Decatur pet-sitter , says her clients ' animals - and her own dogs and cats - are suffering . " The fleas are worse on the cats this year than I 've ever seen them . " Her dog , Killer , an Irish setter mix , has spent the summer " trying to rip the siding off the back of the house " by vigorously scratching her hindquarters against the wood . <p> Americans will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off these ectoparasites . Richard Kramer , an entomologist with the National Pest Control Association in Dunn Loring , Va. , says fleas are probably the No. 4 insect pest , behind ants , termites and cockroaches . <p> But back in the 14th century , the flea was definitely public enemy No. 1 . <p> Beginning in 1346 , Oriental rat fleas , hitchhiking on swarms of rodents in Europe 's overcrowded cities , spread bubonic plague throughout the Old World , killing between a third and half of the population . <p> While the Black Death began to recede within two years , it would return in force in the 1600s and the late 1800s , and in some areas , including parts of Africa and the American Southwest , it has remained stubbornly entrenched . There are about 10 to 15 cases of plague reported in this country each year , but only a few deaths . It 's no wonder that the diminutive biter responsible for Europe 's greatest catastrophe has fascinated scientists and the general public . When the 17th-century Dutch naturalist Anton van Leeuwenhoek created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the lens was a flea . His colleagues apparently enjoyed getting a good look at the creatures , and Leeuwenhoek 's invention became known as a " flea glass . " <p> Leeuwenhoek also discovered that the dreaded flea carried its own parasitic mites , which inspired his contemporary , Jonathan Swift , to write a famous rhyming comment . A bastardized version : <p> Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite ' em , <p> And little fleas have lesser fleas , and so ad infinitum . <p> It 's a good bet that essayists such as Swift and poets such as George Herbert and John Donne ( " The Flea " ) were interested in fleas for very personal reasons : They had ' em . Before the 20th century introduced regular bathing to much of the world , fleas were a fact of life for a large percentage of the two-legged species . <p> Embarrassingly enough , humans are unique among primates in this respect . Among the 2,250 different species of fleas , all adapted to live on various hosts ( cats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorillas or chimps ) there 's a special species for us , Pulex irritans , classified by Linnaeus in the 18th century . <p> Some 100 years before Linnaeus , English noblewomen wore the first flea collars - actually perforated cylinders suspended on necklaces - although there is no evidence that these traps were effective . <p> " Humans very probably picked fleas up when they started living in caves on straw , " says Iowa State University entomology professor and flea expert Robert Lewis . Lacking modern pulicides , or flea poisons , " They learned to live with them , " says Dr. Lewis , " just as many people live with them today . " <p> Dr. Lewis also lives with fleas , although not in a personal relationship . There are 50,000 dead ones which he 's collected from around the world in files at his Ames , Iowa , office . At this same locale are 5,000 research papers by various pulicologists , copies of Dr. Lewis 's newsletter Flea News ( circulation : 175 ) and a few curiosities such as the tiny " pulgas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artisans . <p> Examining these tiny creations under magnification , you can see that one flea is dressed in an apron and carries a parasol ; another wears a hat and a white suit and totes several loaves of bread . How do you dress a flea ? " Very carefully , " says Dr. Lewis . " The damn things are only two or three millimeters long . " <p> Along with the scholarly material , Dr. Lewis 's personal archives include articles from the National Enquirer on flea circuses , which , believe it or not , do exist . <p> Although Mark Twain insisted waggishly that " Fleas can be taught to do nearly everything that a congressman can , " circus fleas actually are little more than disposable insect engines . These " trained " fleas are glued into harnesses attached to tiny carriages and locomotives , weighing up to 1.5 ounces each . In their struggles to escape , the insects can haul thousands of times their own weight . <p> Such gargantuan abilities also contribute to the flea 's enduring charm . Consider the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the species we generally encounter , which attacks dogs and cats equally ) can jump 30,000 times in a row , for 72 continuous hours , without resting . <p> Leaping 12 inches vertically or horizontally , the flea generates 140 G 's , or almost 50 times the acceleration of the space shuttle after liftoff . <p> Fleas somersault as they leap through the air , but land on their feet 78 percent of the time . <p> Fleas can live months without food and can survive being frozen for a year . <p> Such abilities are less than charming to vacationers who return home to find their carpets black with the critters . This common experience is a lesson in the flea 's survival skills , but it also illustrates another peculiar developmental trait . <p> The insect usually undergoes an 18-day metamorphosis from egg to adult ( only adults suck blood ) , including a wormlike larval stage and the cocoonlike pupal stage . Pupae require vibrations to trigger their release from the cocoon , and when you return from the beach and slam the front door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minted adults , hungry for blood . The pre-existing adults who have survived your absence join in for the feast . The main course : your ankles . <p> One Atlanta woman always sends the dogs in the house first , effectively vacuuming the place clean . Fleas rarely bite humans when a dog is available . <p> Most of the harm done to flea-bitten dogs and cats is self- inflicted , in the form of secondary infections from the constant biting and scratching . " Dogs will literally take the meat off their bones , " says Maxcy Nolan , professor of veterinary entomology at the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service . ( Some fleas also carry Dipylidium caninum or tapeworm . A dog that catches and swallows an infected flea can also contract these nasty intestinal parasites . ) <p> Fleas pump anti-coagulants into their victims to keep the blood flowing while they bite . It is this salivary secretion that causes the sting and itch , although some dogs exhibit no allergic reaction to the flea saliva . " Some seem to like a nice little family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and they might be really hurt if they moved off . " <p> Odds are the fleas wo n't . <p> But remember : If they do , they might move in with you . <p> " You do n't have to have pets to get fleas , " says Otis Carlisle , branch manager of Terminix International in Atlanta . Flea eggs can fall off a neighbor 's animal in your yard , then adults can make the short trip inside the house riding on your trouser cuff . <p> At which point , dog or no dog , those fleas are hungry . " Immediately when they hatch , they want a blood feast , " says Mr. Carlisle , " and they attack the nearest thing , which , unfortunately , may be you . " <p> Fleas have been around for 60 million years . <p> The rat flea can carry the bacillus for the bubonic plague , which killed an estimated 25 million people , or one-third to one-half of the population of Europe during the 14th century . <p> Under ideal conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in six months . <p> The cat flea , which is about 2 millimeters long , can jump 12 inches , horizontally or vertically . A human with proportionate jumping ability could almost clear the top of the Empire State Building .
