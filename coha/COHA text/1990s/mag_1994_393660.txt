Harold O'Connor is a man of many contrasts . A master of art jewelry , he is widely respected in Europe for his technical virtuosity , but known in this country primarily to fellow jewelers , museum curators and a handful of knowledgeable collectors . He has chosen to live and work in isolation in Salida , Colorado  --  a sleepy agricultural town located on the shores of the Arkansas River , high in the Rocky Mountains . Yet , he perfected his craft in Europe , studying in Finland , Germany , Denmark and Austria . Often mislabeled a recluse , he is an ebullient person , who eagerly shares his ideas and techniques with budding artists in workshops he conducts all over the world . And while he may lament the impact of the industrial revolution  --  " Mass production destroyed the artist 's relationship to his craft ! "  --  he has nevertheless demonstrated his mastery of technology in the numerous books he has authored for the trade , and in his work , which is represented in the permanent collections of the Renwick Gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Czech Republic and Goldsmiths Hall in London , among others . O'Connor stumbled on jewelry quite by accident in his senior year at the University of New Mexico , when he took a course in metalwork and became entranced with the challenge of translating ideas into solid form . Under the tutelage of Ralph Lewis , he made 50 pieces of jewelry that year . " Metal is my medium , " he says . " I could just as easily have been a painter or a sculptor . " Indeed , among the influences he cites are the sculptors David Smith , Isamu Noguchi , Anthony Caro and Eduardo Chillida . Having identified his passion for metalwork , O'Connor traveled to Copenhagen in 1965 to study at the National Arts and Crafts School . In 1966 he spent a semester at Helsinki 's National Arts and Crafts School , followed by a year at the Fachhochschule fur Gestaltung in Pforzheim , Germany . Lacking fluency in Danish and Finnish  --  he does speak some German  --  O'Connor learned by seeing and doing . " Europeans still use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on basic training . You have to master each technique before you move on to the next . Ultimately , discipline is freedom to do whatever you want to do . " O'Connor also discovered that jewelers in Europe like to make complex pieces and are more oriented to ideas than are their American counterparts . " Accessible jewelry sells in America , but Europeans are intrigued by puzzles and abstract concepts . " This cerebral approach appealed to O'Connor , whose undergraduate major in anthropology had honed his analytical skills and imbued him with the point of view that " anything can be jewelry . " Returning to the United States , O'Connor bypassed his native New York ( he was born in Utica ) to settle in the mountain town of Crested Butte , Colorado , where he opened a studio/gallery in 1968 . ( He lived there off and on until 1978 . ) " In a town of only 200 , everyone has a job description , and I quickly became known as the town goldsmith . I was accepted because I worked hard . " Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had flourished during the silver and gold boom of the 1880s and managed to survive its demise in the 1890s because of coal mining . When O'Connor arrived , however , the only relics of that romantic past were huge , rusting machines , which became the inspiration for a series based on mining . " The challenge was to translate these monumental machines into delicate pieces of wearable jewelry . " ( For O'Connor , all art jewelry ultimately must be wearable . ) He began by addressing problems of suspension  --  holding forms in space  --  creating rings with stones held in place by twisted wire cables instead of bezels . His pins and pendants in 18k gold range from abstract shapes based on actual machines to descriptive pieces replete with intricate gears , pulleys and cables , bearing such titles as Coal Breaker , Mine Header Release Cable and Inspection Plate . The mining series comprises 40 pieces , or miniature sculpture hand fabricated from 18k gold , sterling silver and copper . O'Connor prefers gold because it " does more than any other metal . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry that O'Connor has refined over 25 years . He works thematically , following an idea through any number of permutations and combinations , organizing it into coherent narratives . And he develops techniques to actualize these ideas . In the mining series , for example , he alloyed the gold to produce different colors , used drawplates to hand pull wire into varying thickness for the different cables and pulleys , and embellished surface textures with granulation . Ideas seem to come to O'Connor at a geometric rate . In 1982 , for example , when his father was dying , he was struck by the ephemeral nature of life . This realization led to a series on the theme of time with such titles as Time is Running Out , Marking Time , Grandfather 's Time , Schizophrenic Time , Ragtime and Serving Time . ( The last was a place setting on a ring . ) From his exploration of time , he moved to the objects of time , producing a series of sundials . Recently he returned to the theme with a piece called Neighborhood Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wanted to figure out how to translate soft body tissue into solid form . " And currently he is working on a series of miniature " magical " musical instruments . But perhaps the most important influence on O'Connor is anthropology . In his studio , a converted garage behind his house , he has stacks of books on the prehistoric Indians of the Southwest . Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde , the two great Anasazi ruins of New Mexico and Colorado , particularly intrigue him because they represent the achievement of sophisticated cultures that disappeared mysteriously . O'Connor is already exploring the relationship of man to the unknown in a new series , on amulets and talismans . Always peripatetic , O'Connor left Crested Butte in 1971 to pursue his M.F.A. degree at the Instituto Allende in San Miguel de Allende , Mexico . From 1971 to 1973 , he was an instructor of jewelry and metalwork at the Alberta College of Art in Canada , where he also designed a new shop and a four-year metals program . Upon his return to Crested Butte , he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imprint Dunconor Books ( Dun means fort in Gaelic , thus the Fort of Connor ) . * " The books helped support my art , " says O'Connor , who has found a receptive and loyal audience . The Jeweler 's Bench Reference has sold more than 33,000 copies . O'Connor has also conducted workshops for apprentice jewelers at educational institutions throughout the United States and Canada . Under the Dunconor name , he regularly hosts workshops at his studio to " explore new approaches in the design and construction of metal forms . " O'Connor moved to Denver in 1978 , leaving in 1986 for Taos , New Mexico . In 1993 , he relocated to Salida . " I miss the Taos art community , " he says , " but it was too draining . My best work has been done this past year in isolation . " While ideas may flow easily to O'Connor , it takes time for them to mature into objects because each series represents new technical challenges . O'Connor keeps meticulous notes and sketches his designs in advance of fabrication . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces , though as he has gotten older , he has required fewer tools . " A good artist must be able to improvise with whatever is available , " he says , a concept that has stood him in good stead in his workshops ( particularly those in Eastern Europe , where resources are limited ) . Indeed , O'Connor 's workshops are organized around mandatory exercises , much like figure skating championships . " I like to have students work on a theme , and often I have them make the same thing , such as a container . It takes a different mind-set to apply techniques to ideas . " Fearful of repeating himself or falling into a creative rut , O'Connor constantly challenges himself to come up with unique designs . In a recent series , for example , he uses spicula  --  tapered tubes of metal  --  to suggest the organic sticks and stones found in Japanese gardens . The abstract shapes also take on masculine and feminine associations , and in some instances , one is reminded of artifacts found at prehistoric Indian ruins in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 1994 exhibition in Portugal , the spiculum is the design principle through which he explores relationships between space and matter . The technique of using hollow shapes to suggest objects of greater weight interests O'Connor , who tries to keep the dimensions of his pieces no larger than two inches . With such a small canvas to work on , every detail is critical , and none more so than when stones are added . A favorite stone of his is spectrolite , a feldspar discovered in Finland in 1938 that appears opaque and dark upon first observation . When the light strikes it at 30 degrees , it takes on brilliant hues of green and blue . While O'Connor does not do lapidary , he selects his materials carefully , even traveling to mines in Finland for the spectrolite he uses in his work . For O'Connor , jewelry presents a contrast between texture and smooth surfaces . He has experimented with various forms of casting , including cuttlefish bone , which leaves a porous imprint on the metal . He also favors reticulation , a method of texturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and then heating the piece until the granules become part of the surface , and mokume , a Japanese technique of laminating metals to create a surface for repousse design . He is an expert at layering metal until it looks like crinkled paper . Most recently , O'Connor has inlaid pieces of granulated metal in rock as one more exercise in the study of surface differences . Whatever technique he chooses , he approaches each piece of jewelry as a work of art . These objects do n't just happen but are the result of study , research , meditation , painstaking draftsmanship and highly skilled craftsmanship . His workbench , a model of order , reflects Harold O'Connor 's organized and pragmatic approach , while the jewelry exemplifies his unique sense of design and intellectual freedom . * These include New Directions in Goldsmithing ( 1975 ) , Procedures and Formulas for Metal Craftsmen ( 1976 ) , The Jeweler 's Bench Reference ( 1977 ) , Creative Jewelry Techniques ( 1978 ) and The Flexible Shaft Machine ( 1983 ) .
