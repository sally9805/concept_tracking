<p> An important rescue mission is taking place here on the Cape Cod coast , where the Atlantic surf is eroding away the sandy cliffs that undergird many Cape communities . <p> Officials have decided the only way to save a 66-foot-high , 420-ton lighthouse from crashing into the surf is to pick it up and move it . <p> Heralded as the Cape 's most cherished landmark , the Highland Light in Truro - also known as the Cape Cod Light - is in the final stretch of a $ 1.5 million relocation project that began last Wednesday . <p> The white brick lighthouse , originally built of wood in 1797 and rebuilt in 1831 and 1857 , is being pushed 450 feet on a makeshift railroad laid down by International Chimney Corp . of Buffalo , N.Y. , and Maryland-based Expert House Movers Inc . They are the same contractors who in 1993 successfully moved the 2,000-ton Southeast Lighthouse on Block Island , R.I. , and restored the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse in North Carolina . <p> " If man can build it , man can move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chimney . " It 's strictly a function of time and money . " <p> The project has become a major tourist attraction this summer . Hundreds of onlookers have gathered daily at the edge of a fence some 300 feet away , where a National Park Service ranger stands guard . <p> " Lighthouses are one of those interesting buildings that everyone takes a liking to , " says Larry Davis , project manager with the US Army Corps of Engineers . " They are really part of our heritage . " <p> Some enthusiasts spent a good part of their vacations waiting for the first budge . <p> " I want to see it move a little bit , " says Ginny Stockford , a visitor from the Cape Cod town of South Yarmouth . " It 's nostalgic . Imagine being out at sea , looking for that light . " <p> The ultimate goal is to have the lighthouse open to the public by next April . The Coast Guard , National Park Service , and the local historical society are all expected to play a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Basically , the lighthouse is being jacked up from its weak , three-foot-deep foundation and pushed down a set of seven steel beams to a new location 570 feet from the eroding , 160-foot-high bluff . During the journey , the lighthouse will drop 10 feet in elevation . <p> In May , before any movement took place , the chimneys , lens , and window openings on the tower and adjacent building were braced . Some wiring and plumbing in both buildings was removed . Floors were also removed in both buildings . Cracks in masonry were repaired . <p> Although the lighthouse may sway at times during the move , Mr. Copeland says the bracing will keep it from tipping over . The Southeast Lighthouse , which weighs 2,000 tons , had only a few cracks as a result of its move . <p> Work crews dug out Cape Cod Light 's foundation and used diamond-tipped drills to bore through the brick foundation walls and insert a network of 30 cross-beams . Four levels of crisscrossing beams form the base to support the building before the move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its old foundation . Six-by-six-foot wooden timbers were used for " cribbing " to provide space for the installation of the steel track , which consists of two sets of 40-foot long I-beams . <p> The hydraulic system that will push the Highland Light to its new location consists of fourteen 50-ton jacks , resting on fourteen 75-ton dollies . The move was expected to take about a week . <p> Twelve additional jacks will lower the structure at intervals over the length of the move , while four 40-ton rams provide the real horsepower behind the move , pushing the lighthouse five feet at a time . The track will be rearranged 11 times before the move is complete , Copeland said . <p> " The last-minute adjustments are taking the most time , " Copeland said on the first day the lighthouse was moved . On the other hand , he said , lighthouses are not particularly difficult to move . " It 's no more tricky than moving any other piece of masonry , " he says . <p> Although there are other ways to move a lighthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the Army Corps of Engineers , which awarded the contract . Another contractor proposed pouring a concrete ramp and rolling the lighthouse on massive dollies . <p> Who pays for it ? <p> Financing the project took state and federal support , but the effort would not have begun if it were not for the Truro Historical Society , which spearheaded the project starting in 1987 . The society collected 100,000 signatures and raised $ 150,000 . <p> " We knew that the light would eventually go over the cliff , " says Bob Firminger , treasurer of the society and vice chairman of the Committee to Save the Cape Cod Light . " We believe that it should be preserved for future generations . " <p> If all goes as planned , the lighthouse , which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places , will be set in its new foundation this week or early next . An adjacent wood-framed light keeper 's house will be moved separately on dollies . Additional work , to enlarge a parking lot and build a movable observation deck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in danger <p> About 15 miles to the south , the Nauset Light in Eastham is in even more dire straits than the Highland Light , resting a mere 35 feet from the bluffs . Maria Burks , superintendent of the Cape Cod National Seashore , which owns the Nauset land , says that project , estimated to cost approximately $ 600,000 , is currently out for bid , and work is expected to begin sometime in October . <p> The Nauset Light will be pushed back about 250 feet from the bluffs . While it is no longer an official guide to navigation , it is still used by local mariners . <p> Unlike the Highland Light project , in which a federal agency - the Army Corps - is overseeing the operation , a private group , the Nauset Light Preservation Society , is the driving force behind the relocation , Ms. Burks says . <p> Group members have solicited about $ 100,000 in private donations . Another $ 500,000 in federal funding has been approved , Burks says .

" All of a sudden , we realize we care about them , " she says . " Both of the lighthouses have become beloved symbols of a special place . " <p> A local preservation society , the Coast Guard , and the US Army Corps of Engineers team up to move historic Cape Cod Light off an eroding cliff . A nearby lighthouse is still in danger . 1 ) LOOMING MONUMENT : Nauset Light , 15 miles south of Highland Light on the Cape Cod National Seashore , stands only 35 feet from the eroding cliffs and is slated to be moved back 250 feet in the fall . 2 ) New tourist attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day moving was to begin .
