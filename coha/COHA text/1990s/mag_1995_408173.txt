" CHUCK IBIS " IS IBIS FOUNDER SCOT Nicol 's Batman , a superhero alter-ego doing battle in the corporate cycling world . I 've received letters and voice mail from the nonexistent Chuck . I 've phoned the company and asked for Scot , only to be told he was out but Chuck could take my call . Sometimes I ask to speak to Chuck and " accidentally " get transferred to Scot 's line . You never really know who you have on the other end . Ibis is one of the rare companies that remembers fun and quality are n't parts of an either/or equation . It 's earned a reputation for producing exquisite handbuilt frames with artful paint jobs and crazy details . For instance , our metallic blue Easy Street tandem features the hand-shaped rear-brake-cable hanger known as the " Hand Job . " Look under the stoker 's top tube and you 'll see a similarly machined foot-shaped pump peg , the " Toe Jam . " This industrial whimsy makes ownership a little sweeter , but it can add expense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny , sculpted arm and hand for free . The $2,699 Easy Street is Nicol 's attempt to steer around this pitfall and introduce wares to more consumers while maintaining a custom feel . So how did a company whose next-cheapest tandem is $3,499 bring in a twicer that costs less than any other duo we tested ? By cutting options , for one . The Easy Street is available in metallic blue or metallic blue , and comes in only medium ( 55-cm top tube captain/50 cm stoker ) and large ( 58/52 ) sizes . And there 's no spec option beyond the stock package . " Instead of cutting corners in building the frame , we attacked the price from an administrative side , " Nicol explains . " We eliminated a lot of overhead and bookkeeping time that 's required when you do bikes with a lot of variables . And we built the bikes and ordered parts 100 at a time . It 's the most streamlined we 've ever been . " That 's nice , but it would n't matter if the bike rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( I have trouble calling $2,699 a budget buy , but everything is relative . According to our Super Specs database of ' 95 bikes , only 11 out of the 33 available road tandems cost less . ) My wife and I put a couple hundred miles on the Easy in a week , doing everything from a 25-mile spontaneous TT into a headwind to a 15-mile slow-speed tootle along a flat Florida bike path . I knew the narrow , 700C wheels would make this bike a fast roller . But as a captain experienced only in 26-inch wheel tandeming , I wondered how the bigger wheels would track at slow speeds and during difficult , tight turns . We carved like an electric knife . Nicol says this is because he experimented with frame geometry until he found a head angle ( 73 degrees , with a matching seat-tube angle ) and fork rake combination that produced identical trail ( 2.89 inches ) to that of his 26-inch wheel tandems . While the wheels are n't 26-inch bombers , they 're plenty strong : 40-hole , Mavic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the same wheels Ibis specs on the more expensive Touche ) . In back , the Hugi engages with 18 teeth instead of the 2 or 3 pawls common in other freehubs . We found the ride comfy and smooth . Beth has backseated 26-inch-wheel tandems from Ibis ( the now-defunct Uncle Fester ) , Cannondale and Specialized , plus a Softride-beam-equipped Burley and even a Ryan recumbent . Excepting the beamer , she says she 's never ridden such a compliant twicer . She emerged from a ride nearly 4 hours long with tush intact . And that 's with a seat she hated  --  the oversize and over-squishy Specialized Woman 's model . The wide wings and bouncy surface that might earn raves from new tandemists or casual riders are minuses for performance pedaling . ( The captain 's perch is the Specialized ProLong . ) John Pavlat , a former Santana employee who helped create the Easy Street , defends the stoker seat selection by noting that at this price the tandem is more likely to be sitting under novice or intermediate riders than hardcores . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear of the beholder . " Another spec that seems novice-oriented is the SR clips-and-straps pedals . Now that Sean Kelly has retired , find me a road rider who still uses foot cages . C'm on , Chuck . But these are minor complaints . The frame itself is pure Ibis : a smooth riding , built-to-last rip with flawless , a strong welds and workmanship . Just as the more untrained eyes among us go ga-ga over obvious details such as the Hand Job , cycling purists will praise the tube joints . They 're darn purty  --  if you know what to look for . In fact , not all the neat tricks are as apparent as the Toe Jam . For instance , Ibis reduced frame weight to a reasonable 10.6 pounds by using lighter-gauge 1-1/4-inch True Temper seat tubes . To handle the stress of the seat post and clamp , the tubes are fitted with thicker-wall " seat collars " about 2 inches from the top . I think of the bike as racy , but it 's equipped with braze-ons for fenders and racks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third brake . ( The Hugi hub is threaded to accept disc or drum . ) This is a breakthrough bike for Nicol 's company . I 've recommended Ibi ( is n't that the plural ! ) to several cyclists , but until now I 've never been able to describe one as a bargain . If you 'd like to decide for yourself , you can do the same thing I did  --  take one for a test ride . Ibis has a nationwide demo program that sends 2 tandems and 5-7 singles to shops , making them available on a loaner basis . Bug your local shop for a free ride . Tell ' em Chuck Ibis sent you . <p>
