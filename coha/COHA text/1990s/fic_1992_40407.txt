LIVING IN A GLASS PRISM : THE FEMALE FIGURE IN LUDWIG MIES VAN DER ROHE 'S . DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE I leaned against the glass door at its neurologic point so that it broke suddenly with an unknown noise of thunder , harsh screams of glass . Breaking of vertebrae , horrible shattering of an almost human body , explosion of meaning ... points of truth which are staked in all corners , even the most remote of my memory and of my eyes ... all is taken in by a light which surprises furtivities ... the curtains burn , burnt eyelashes fall from my eyelids into the hollow of my neck , blood flows in Pompeii , flows into dried up bones and dead veins. - Helene Cixous . <p> In the May 1953 issue of House Beautiful , magazine 's editor , Elizabeth Gordon , launched a journalistic campaign against International Style architects . She charged them with importing a European cultural dictatorship to the United States . Representing the International Style as " The Threat to the Next America , " Gordon contends that the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unlivibility , stripped-down emptiness , lack of storage space , and therefore lack of possessions . " She describes German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and his minimalist cohorts as a " self-chosen elite who are trying to tell us what we should like a how we should live . " Calling up the specter of fascist rule from its cold war grave , she warns that " if we can be sold on accepting dictators in matters of taste ... our minds are certainly well prepared to accept dictators in other departments of life . " In a provincial anti-modernist rhetoric typical of the McCarthy era , Gordon 's zealous defense of American ingenuity bears a relation to more recent critiques of modernism that claim its functionalist rationale is a veil for purely aesthetic concerns . According to this architectural criticism , minimalism fosters an illusion of efficiency and structural honesty at the price of real functionalism or true design integrity . <p> Gordon extended her editorial campaign into the next issue of House Beautiful with Joseph Barry 's article , " Report on the American Battle Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Edith Farnsworth , then engaged in a lawsuit against Mies van der Rohe for substantial cost overruns in the construction of her weekend house outside Chicago ( Fig.1 ) . Asked to describe her experiences of living in the house , Farnsworth responds : Mies wanted the partition closet five feet high for reasons of " art and proportion . " Well , I 'm six feet tall . Since my house is all " open space , " I needed something to shield me when I had guests . I wanted to be able to change my clothes without my head looking like it was wandering over the top of the partition without a body . <p> Barry published such comments to undermine what he saw as the architectural community 's misguided endorsement of the house . According to Barry , critics had erroneously acclaimed Mies 's design for its " implacable calm , " " precise simplicity , " and " meticulous detail , " while ignoring the mundane realities of its need for continuous maintenance , the difficulty of heating or cooling its large expanses of glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate the material needs of human life . And yet , so established was the structure 's place in the pantheon of modern architecture , Farnsworth 's dissatisfaction and Gordon 's editorial campaign ultimately tarnished Mies van der Rohe 's reputation much less than their own . <p> Rumors that Farnsworth was infatuated with Mies and had an affair with him further discredited her criticism . Her comment that Mies gave " no thought of me at any time " while he was designing her house , led many to dismiss her comments as the complaints of a spurned lover . While Mies may not have considered Farnsworth in his design , House Beautiful gave her little more consideration in its campaign against Mies . The magazine ran a cartoon titled " The Emperor 's New Palace " that depicts the sovereign of Mies 's glass house not as a middle-aged woman like Farnsworth , but as a nude male . Taken out of the picture by both her architect and his opponents , Farnsworth seems doomed to be supplanted by men . Not surprisingly , in 1962 she sold her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mies . <p> If only by accident and omission , the House Beautiful articles and its " Emperor 's Palace " cartoon call attention to woman 's position within the modernist house . Barry 's article focuses on a single professional woman and architectural patron in a debate initiated by a female editor and published by a magazine marketing modish domesticity to women . But when Barry criticized Mies for failing to recognize the needs of his client by asking , " How about the individual human being in question my emphasis , " he overlooked the crucial point of Edith Farnsworth 's gender . In this paper I propose to rephrase Barry 's question and ask , " How about the individual woman in question ? " <p> A close look at issues of gender in his architecture exposes the ambivalence in Mies 's treatment of sexuality and space . Although working against norms of bourgeois femininity , Mies reconstructed women as objects of fetishized contemplation . The females who live in Mies 's glass houses serve as handmaids to patriarchal ideals of transcendence that are compatible with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective glass , the female figure , both the statue and the woman , is the instrument through which Mies 's architectural space must be viewed . Reflected through the vessel of woman , the house of glass sparkles with order and meaning . But what happens to the lady of the house when she is constructed to serve Mies 's purposes ? What happens to her perception , her subjectivity , if her body is used to define the form and space she occupies ? I am thus positing two different modes of spatial occupation vis-a-vis Mies 's domestic architecture : a tactile understanding of form arrived at through the body , and a cognitive appropriation of space through optical perception . These two modes correspond to the different positions of feminine and masculine subjects within Mies 's domestic interior . <p> Contemporary feminist theorists have noted that the gendering of these two positions of perception has resulted , historically , in the subordination of bodily perception to abstract cognitive apprehension . Their work takes up categories found as well in Walter Benjamin 's earlier adaptation of Alois Riegl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses this distinction to describe perception as it works either bodily and tactilely - the haptic - or through a more cognitively filtered process of sight - the optic . I intend to elaborate Riegl 's haptic/optic distinction in relation to gender by proposing that haptic cognition - a form of bodily apprehension - is useful for tactics of feminist architectural criticism . The notion of haptic cognition - that is mentally appropriating space and objects through the body - sustains a feminist approach the generates the woman 's voice from her physical immanence . In a revisionary look at the traditional mind/body hierarchical split , Helene Cixous 's notion of writing through the body , Luce Irigaray 's specular womb , and Jane Gallop 's bodily enigma , all address western philosophy 's elevation of the mind at the expense of the body . Historically this has brought with it the privileging of the transcendent and abstract - gendered masculine - over the material and concrete - given the lowly status of the feminine . <p> Riegl , Benjamin , French feminism - I draw on this constellation of theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , architecture and gender in Mies 's work . Feminist discourse suggests a distinction between the optical occupation of a Mies residence as a guest for whom the architectural space remains external , and a more internalized sensual inhabitation of architecture through empathetic penetration of form . This distinction reverses previous constructions of the sensual body as somehow subordinate to the intellectual gaze . Bodily , material , tactile comprehension is revalued as at least as valid as the kind of perception that aims at a transcendence of the sensual through an intellectualized , abstracted , and controlling gaze . <p> Mies 's design career displays an evolution from early explorations of the tactility of materials to later interests in framing forms that encourage a hands-off , visual apprehension . An examination of the sculpture of women carefully located by Mies in his buildings , reveals this evolution as working toward a repression of sensual in favor of conceptual space . I intend to critique his use of female figures by focusing on how the statues and , by extension , the living woman 's body within the architecture , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his houses and strips them of inessential objects in a gesture that reveals a distinctly masculine form of spiritual transcendence . By removing corporeal , feminine matter from the house 's interior , Mies disciplines his architecture with a minimalist tidiness . Starting by tossing out her fetishistic possessions , Mies 's clean-sweep ends with the wholesale elimination of woman 's body . In what follows , I will first demonstrate that Mies strategically positioned female statues within his buildings as surrogate interlocutors held captive behind glass walls . Their relationship with glass surfaces and their physical impenetrability fits Mies 's residential architecture to the description of Michel Carrouges 's " Bachelor Machine , " a mechanism designed for philosophical celibacy that renounces woman and the flesh , or at least women in the flesh . In such a scheme the figurines act as ersatz companions and offer the single , contemplative male conspicuous sites for his haptic engagement with architectural space . Absorbing libidinal desire in their silent surfaces , the statues sublimate and channel the sensual impulse to touch into the cerebral act of contemplating art . Secondly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehension offers a tactic for a feminist possession of architecture . To make this case I will draw on an analogy between Luce Irigaray 's figure for female subjectivity - a woman 's labia as continually touching each other - and the sculpture 's position within the residence . Within this analogy , the sculptures in Mies 's buildings may be allegorized as transfiguring specula that refract feminine material into masculine form . What this feminist reading of Mies shows is his exploitation of the female figure as the instrumental object of architectural desire . <p> Occupants of the Bachelor Machine <p> As figures of women frozen in a glass cube , stranded in a pool of water , isolated on a pedestal , or petrified in a garden , Mies 's female statues occupy a dubiously privileged position in the Glass Room at the Stuttgart Werkbund Exhibition of 1927 ( Fig. 2 ) , the German Pavilion in Barcelona of 1929 ( Fig. 3 ) , the Model House at the Berlin Building Exhibition of 1931 ( Fig. 4 ) , and the Tugendhat house of 1930 , respectively ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three exhibition buildings as a dynamic element that directs the spectator 's movement through space ; the full figure of Morning beckons at the end of an axis in the Barcelona Pavilion , the Girl 's Torso Turning glances out of her cell in the Glass Room , and an anonymous statue walks in the garden outside the study of the Berlin House . Another torso sits counterpoised on a pedestal in the Tugendhat House ; her shoulders point toward the exterior window as she glances toward the sitting area . <p> Carefully positioning these statues of women as integral to the architecture , Mies , a kind of modernist Pygmalion , brings them to life . No longer mere mantle busts or domesticated herms , his figures take on roles - as sacerdotal temple attendants or loyal servants who receive guests . In these carefully orchestrated tableaux vivants , the statues articulate a spatial tension in Mies 's open yet inflexible plans . This precise tension between the statues , the furniture that he and Lilly Reich designed , and the architecture , in fact , confirms Edith Farnsworth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his space is very fixed . " Captured , mounted , and displayed as compliant objects of passive contemplation , the statues represent the ideal woman as a conversation piece who can not speak , a patient female who never interrupts . <p> And yet , within the reduced architecture of window , wall , and column , these naked figures give voice to what Manfredo Tafuri , Francesco Dal Co , Michael Hays , and Kenneth Frampton have referred to as Mies 's silent architecture . Ostensibly , the architecture speaks through the statues of silenced women which function as the plastic media through which the surrounding space communicates . They are the necessary holes in the architectural representation 's scopophilic objective . The statues ' bodies function as dark perforations in Mies 's architecture ; they operate as the essential lack necessary for perceiving the space contiguous to their silhouettes . In other words , the statues create the void necessary for perceiving the spatial solid . Desirable for their phallic stiffness , they compensate for the woman 's body that has been castrated under the scrutiny of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary deficit to amend previous evaluations of Mies 's architecture as silent negation . They suggest instead that his residences ' articulation of space is fully audible , but only through the amplification of the mute female figures that , in effect , serve their master 's voice . <p> Mies 's affinity for the sculptor Wilhelm Lehmbruck underscores this interpretation of his residences as communicating space through statues of women . Although another sculptor , Georg Kolbe , completed the two full-figure statues for the Barcelona Pavilion , Mies 's first choice was for a Lehmbruck . Mies visited Lehmbruck frequently between 1915 and 1916 , when the two artists shared a theoretical dialogue . Lehmbruck 's approach to sculpture corresponds to Mies 's famous maxims that god dwells in the details and that architecture expresses the will of the epoch translated into space . According to Lehmbruck : <p> All art is measure ... therefore , a god sculpture must be handled like a good composition , like an architectural edifice , where measure speaks against measure ; therefore , details can not be ignored , for the detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art exists without an outline or without a silhouette , and a silhouette is nothing more than flatness my emphasis . <p> Both Lehmbruck 's and Kolbe 's figures gesture toward melancholic reflection , an idealized human body , pensive silence , and the struggle to express a national German modernism rooted in classical restraint . Lehmbruck 's work , recognized for its attenuated forms and expressive voids , complements the spatial materiality between emphatic silhouettes and contributes to the statuesque quality of Mies 's architecture . <p> The Lehmbruck and Kolbe statues that dwell within Mies 's residences illustrate the tenuous equilibrium maintained by a modern classicism that attempts to translate the spirit of the times into eternal architectural form . Mies 's preference for figural sculpture introduces an anachronistic element of representational art into his abstract , modernist designs . Mies 's preference for the human body interferes with his modernist architectural montage of framed nature by littering it with classical human forms . It is tempting to assert that he planted the sculpture subversively , as humanist elements in non-rooms , non-buildings , and non-landscapes . Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to disrupt but to harmonize with the architectural setting . Mies 's practice of carefully positioning sculpture as a narrative element in the architecture and landscape supports this interpretation of his residences as allegorical pavilions within picturesque gardens that contain " spectral classical artifacts . " <p> I have constructed these two arguments , perhaps , from a false opposition that disguises the fact that the statues complete the architecture by providing one pole of formal tension of contraries : concordia discors . Taken in complementary relationship like this , the apparent discord between the statues and the architectural design ultimately establishes an aesthetic concordance . That the statues are figures of women demonstrates that these seemingly discordant interpretations of the sculpture , as either Dadaist contamination or humanist unification , actually reinforce each other . As condensed and saturated sites of carnal desire , the female statues take on classical architectural form that allows them to function as allegorical temple attendants who embody a salacious critique of what would otherwise be a chaste architecture . They trigger associations with ancient sexual ritual and myths of female eroticism that violate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excavated from Pompeii , the statues appear as if about to awaken to a modern , new world , while simultaneously gesturing to the atavism of a more ancient ideal . <p> The statues function as compelling corpulent objects within the lean framework of what Mies referred to as an architecture of skin and bones . He located the sculpted women in specific relation to reflective and transparent surfaces where they submit to a voyeurism that compels looking but forbids touching . In line with the dominant symbolic system , Mies gendered tactility as feminine . Although " the windowpane is what allows us to see , " as Michel de Certeau observes , it is also what keeps us from touching . The window seems to tell the hapless spectator , " You shall not touch ; the more you see the less you hold . " Mies 's placement of female statues behind a windowpane , in an isolated pool of water , or simply up on a pedestal , lowers an impalpable screen in front of the sculpture that denies even as it entices the touch . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retain complete control over " his " interiors , Mies builds into his very designs obstacles to the personalized display of the occupant 's belongings . Thus another debate over Mies 's residential designs , perhaps more revealing than Elizabeth Gordon 's in House Beautiful , illustrates that Mies 's designs controlled the occupant by controlling the things in her house and by placing her in a position similar to the statues ' . In response to critic Justus Bierr , who asked , " Is it possible to live in the Tugendhat House ? " both Frau and Herr Tugendhat answered a decisive " Yes . " And yet , read in their entirety , the Tugendhats ' affirmations suspiciously echo Mies 's own aesthetic rhetoric . In fact the house is livable only if the occupants transform their material lives in accordance with rarified architectural precepts . In her attempt to defend Mies , Grete Tugendhat inadvertently emphasizes the difficulties of living in the house when she claims that his spaces instill a liberating austerity : This austerity for bids merely passing time by relaxing ' and letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to something else that today 's people , exhausted and drained by their professional work , require and sense as liberation . For just as one sees each flower in this room in quite an uncommon way , and every piece of art seems more expressive ( for example a piece of sculpture standing in front of an onyx wall ) , so too a person appears to himself and others , to be more clearly set off from his surroundings my emphasis . <p> Confessing that she finds forced conduct liberating , Frau Tugendhat describes herself as distinct from the surroundings like a piece of sculpture . Similarly , Fritz Tugendhat compares himself to the torso : It is true that one can not hang any pictures in the main space , in the same way that one can not introduce a piece of furniture that would destroy the stylistic unity of the original furnishings - but is our " personal life repressed " for that reason ? The incomparable patterning of the marble and the natural graining of the wood do not take the place of art , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is here art . Moreover , " art " is permitted to take on a special importance in the form of a noble sculpture by Lehmbruck , just as our personal lives do - more freely than ever emphasis . <p> His admission that one can not rearrange furniture in the rooms or even hang pictures on the walls undermines his characterization of the house as liberating space . Rather , the Tugendhats are conditionally liberated within fixed arrangements that transfix them in space as sculptural objects . Both of their descriptions of the house focus on the Lehmbruck torso as the catalyst necessary to see themselves as spatial silhouettes and , consequently , to perceive their lives as transformed into art . Censoring possessions , announcing where to sit , and suggesting where to look , the speaking architecture transforms the occupants from subjects into objects . While a dialogic relationship between building and occupant - Mies 's " silent " architecture - is impossible , a monologue is performed by a silencing , rather than silent , architecture . <p> Mies 's formative experience designing residences for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gallery , while his later projects from a series of temporary pavilions inverted the house as a site for exhibiting objects into the exhibition as a site for objectifying the house and its occupants . The Stuttgart and Berlin Exhibitions and the Barcelona Pavilion , replete with female statues , articulate this relationship between house and museum . In Mies 's attempt to transform life into art , he establishes the curatorial role of an architecture that displays and frames its occupants as objects within the residential exhibition . But Mies 's highly-polished , modern world also indentures the occupants as silenced servants curating the architectural exhibition . Conserving the residential museum required a rigorous routine of waxing and dusting ( whether performed by a maid or , in Dr. Farnsworth 's case , by the owner herself ) to eliminate any " dirty linen " that might be exposed by the glass walls . <p> The notion of museological interiors , as Emily Apter discusses in her work on feminizing the fetish , emerged from a nineteenth-century mania for collecting and the curio-cabinets used to display its fruits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms superfluously filled with fetishistic minutiae had to be stripped . The modernist ideology of functional architecture sanctioned the removal of what had been feminine ornament and displaced the earlier horror vacui with a masculine cult of clean , empty space . Herr Tugendhat 's " horror of doilies and knick-knacks , " marks the nineteenth-century collector 's transformation into the twentieth-century curator . Likewise , Mies 's substitution of abstract objects for personal possessions corresponds with the modernist compulsion to cleanse fetish objects from the new hygienic interior . In his domestic architecture , however , such erasure had more to do with scale than with content ; in actuality , he radically increased the size of the glass case and filled it with a life-size collection of spectacular bodies . Despite his effort to purify the field of vision by removing annoying distractions and his attempt to replace jumbled multiplicity with focused singularity , Mies nonetheless succumbed to a new kind of collecting mania for surrogate companions . <p> Somewhere between Freud 's fetishistic shine on the nose and Mies 's nickel-plated columns , the architect 's obsessive reliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object fetishism . Cloaked as necessary " functional details " Mies slipped in his own fetish objects and , at the same time , removed any opportunity for women to display their own possessions within his interiors . While the man 's fetish results from an optical misperception that inscribes a lack upon the woman 's body , the female fetish involves a tactile experience of her body flowing into external objects , an experience that confirms not lack but abundance . Pursuing a strategy that , perhaps regrettably , confirms a notion of the female as essentially sentimental or maternal , critical attempts to dephallusize the fetish often cite women 's collections of family portraits and other such domestic mementos . Mies removes the nooks , cubbyholes , shelves , and walls where women display their precious fetishes and sentences his female occupants to an emptied life of scarcity . <p> In comparison with the nineteenth-century display cabinets or the highly feminized Jugenstil interiors , Mies reinvests his spaces with conquering masculinity . He overdetermines the objects ' capacity for libidinal associations by reducing their number as sites for erotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " less is more " as just another form of object cathexis . With glass walls and open plans , Mies evacuates the secret chambers of furtive pleasure most generally associated with sexual intimacy and delivers the pristine body from the bedroom closet to display its naked truth as an emancipated and exhibitionist spirit freed from stains of corporeal sin . Within this liberation , however , Mies subjects the woman 's body - like Fransworth 's dismembered head " wandering over the top of the partition without a body " - to a process of castration and veneration that fragments her as a living detail . <p> Representative of the dualities within Mies 's residential architecture , it is possible to understand his progressive displacement of the spaces associated with femininity as liberating women from what the philosopher Georg Simmel referred to as the " moral and psychological prison or psychopathic ward " of the domestic interior . In this respect , Mies specifically attempts to create " a measure of freedom " for all of the occupants within his architecture regardless of their gender . Mies thoroughly enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilly Reich and we also know that women helped him to obtain many of his most important commissions . And yet , the statues mark his residences as imprisoning the female figure within glass walls . They reveal his construction of a feminine mode of occupancy that may have liberated the woman from the domestic interior but that nonetheless frames her as an essential and erotic lack within the surrounding space . In fact , Mies " liberates " the woman from her own house . His diverse interactions with remarkably willful women and his reaction against bourgeois conventions , led him in his residential architecture , as we will see later , to construct the modern woman as having the self-reliant and abstract femininity of a trans-sexual being . <p> Mies 's experiments in new form of living reflect his own need for privacy within the isolated contemplation and " forced " liberation of the glass prism . Even before his marriage to Ada Bruhn had deteriorated , Mies began to adopt a bachelor life . He enjoyed weekends away from his wife at their country house in Werder where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other women . Aside from briefly sharing an apartment with Lilly Reich , after separating from his wife around 1921 , he never again lived under the same roof with a female companion and remained until death a confirmed bachelor . Perhaps the spatial openness Mies explored after he emigrated to the United States had less to do with what he had discovered in the new society than with what he had left behind in bourgeois Germany . He had abandoned the concept of matrimony ; he had left his wife , three daughters , and his companion , Lilly Reich . Personally unable to embrace the outmoded institution of marriage , he labored to transform traditional bourgeois marital restraints into liberating architectural forms . This is how he responded to designing for an institution in which he had little success , an institution based upon the drive to own property and dominate others that , according to many including Freidrich Nietzsche , had lost its meaning and was being abolished . <p> In his attempt to engage in " the larger struggle for new forms of living , " Mies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupant . While designing a house and furnishing a bachelor 's apartment for the 1931 Berlin Building Exhibition , Mies lived in his own bachelor atelier . He converted the master bedroom of his Berlin apartment into a studio and placed his bed in the bathroom . The distinctly monastic Courtyard Houses , the Hubbe House ( designed for a single woman ) , and the culminating project of this research , the country retreat for the solitary Dr. Farnsworth , are examples of contemplative retreats that also function as pleasure pavilions . These are the sanctuaries where one withdraws to explore both ascetic and epicurean sensuality.The house for a bachelor or single occupant became a central typology for Mies that marks a preoccupation with domesticity liberated from cohabitation . This interest approached what Michel Carrouges refers to as the " Bachelor Machine " in Les machines celibataires of 1954 . A Malthusian form of eroticism , Carrouges 's " Bachelor Machine " is an apparatus constructed expressly to deny women and renounce procreation . The machine translates love and marriage into death and solitude as part of a process that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up traditional family structures in order to liberate the individual from familial restrictions . This process corresponds with Mies 's similar attempt to transform the traditional domestic residence into spatial forms liberated from bourgeois constraints . <p> While the dualism of masculine and feminine sexuality at the root of Mies 's domestic architecture conforms to Carrouges 's requirements for his mechanism of celibacy , Jean-Francois Lyotard 's interpretation of the " Bachelor Machine " most closely approximates Mies 's bachelor architecture . According to Lyotard , the first bachelor machine was Pandora , a statue animated to act as a servant in Hephaestus 's house . Pandora serves as a paradigm for the eternal separation between men and the gods who remain bachelors in relation to each other . The dividing wall functions as another type of separating mechanism : " The Partition of a mirror is a machine fed by the objects that are presented to it , and which it reflects . The looker ' is the user of this machine . " Lyotard 's two models of the animated statue and the glass partition strikingly recall Mies 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bachelor Machine . " His architecture of bachelorism attempts to construct a new social vision for both men and women within a philosophy of theoretical celibacy that was hostile to the female gender but contemplated her effigy with the greatest affection . <p> The sculpture and its specific relation to Mies 's reflective partition walls gives woman a role that fluctuates between mannequin and maenad , statue and goddess , even ornament and architecture . These Pandoras within Mies 's glass boxes occupy a prism of indecision , suspended somewhere between equally inhuman possibilities . Life in Miesian solitude , however , would not have been entirely without company ; the female statues walking in gardens or dancing in pools were as much companion pieces as they were objects of contemplation . Peripheral though central , compelling but not threatening , seductive while chaste , these women frozen in eternal youth were ideal companions for a distinctly bachelor form of sensual indulgence . Mies 's acerbic comment that " the lady expected the architect to go along with the house , " resonates with further acrimony when one learns that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue . This omission of the statue , if not the architect , is particularly marked considering sculpture 's significance in his exhibition pavilions and country houses . Haptic Cognition of the Architectural Body But the social space of the interior contains a number of receding levels of privacy . Its front drawing-room becomes the public within the private , while the emotional terrains of motherhood and family relations are torn between facade and repression . Hidden away , invisible and unspeakable , at the point where the private becomes the secret , is the sphere of sexuality . <p> The Farnsworth House 's lack of a statue marks the culmination of Mies 's progression from haptic material to optic forms . As feminist theorists have recognized , haptic or tactile apprehension historically has been gendered feminine , with the optic and intellectual as its masculine counterpart . These categories of cognition were placed in an evolutionary , if not explicitly gendered , schema by Riegl who allied the tactile with the primitive and the optic and with the modern . What I want to follow through here are the relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories of apprehension ; the haptic/primitive is identified with the feminine and so the optic/modern with the masculine . The cluster of terms extends to attract ideas of opacity and materiality to the haptic/feminine pair , and elements of transparency and transcendence to the optic/masculine coupling . Mies 's career recapitulates Reigl 's evolutionary paradigm with an analogous progression from the tactile to the optic , the truly modernist . And , if Mies 's architecture is " physical but bodiless , " according to Robin Evans , and " anti-sensory , " as Jose Quetglas asserts , then the body missing from his residences is female and the antisensory engagement is Mies 's theoretical celibacy . <p> Bringing a feminist revaluation of the body to bear on Riegl 's theory of perception generates a critique of Mies 's residential architecture based on a distinction between haptic/feminine and optic/masculine spaces . The sensual , tactile statues and partition walls provide feminine features in what would otherwise be a masculine construction of space . The notable lack of both statue and woman in the Farnsworth House taken even further the reduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feminine from the domestic scene . My insistence on gendering Riegl 's theory and Mies 's architecture risks essentializing the woman as a primitive mother unable to comprehend abstract , theoretical concepts . Equating the woman with the domestic interior in no way implies that this is a necessary or fundamental relationship , but merely that it has been her culturally determined place . What I would suggest is that although analyses of buildings through notions of haptic and optic cognition have previously functioned as implicit condemnations of the feminine and tactile , this same analytic logic might be reversed to support a feminist critique of masculine scopophilia of the architectural body . <p> Irigaray offers the most challenging and provocative application of corporeal apprehension in a feminist critique of patriarchal ocularcentrism . Arguing that women is continually stimulated by the tactility of two lips rubbing against each other , Irigaray revalues touch : " A woman touches herself constantly without anyone being able to forbid her to do so , for her sex is composed of two lips which embrace continually . Thus , within herself she is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . " While one may question the idea that there is an essential relationship between haptic cognition and the female gender , both Irigaray and Cixous alike employ tactile perception to offer a bodily critique that we can fruitfully apply to Mies 's residential architecture . Mies 's glass architecture denies a return to the tactile memories of birth and the mother . Instead Mies 's telos projects toward the death of corporeality that attempts to liberate the spirit from the body . Like a child who rebels against the mother by " stripping away the membranes , the inheritances he finds too material , too physical , " Mies stripped away the architectural edifice in a gesture Irigaray might describe as " subject to fading and death . " <p> As early as 1921 Mies had conceived of the Friedrichstrasse Office Building entirely covered by a glass skin , but it was not until the Farnsworth House of 1945-50 that he envisioned a similar use of glass in a residence . It took some twenty-five years of exploration for Mies to arrive at the crystalline expression of residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much earlier . Given that the two sites of office and residence mark the separate masculine and feminine spheres of daily life , it also took Mies some twenty-five year to displace the woman from her private place in the domestic interior and to display her as an object captured in glass . <p> Roughly contemporary to the Friedrichstrasse Office Building , the Brick and Concrete Country Houses of the early twenties mark the beginning of Mies 's development from tactile to optical forms , from the opaque wall to the luminous glass facade . Admittedly , this convenient and somewhat artificial approach to Mies 's development as an architect imposes a teleology upon his residential designs not so clearly identifiable in his other work . But this very telos works particularly well with Reigl 's progressive scheme of perception as moving from the haptic to the optic . If Reigl 's system is problematic because it privileges visual over tactile perception within an evolution leading from primitive to modern architecture , it also exposes Mies 's own desire to escape from the building 's feminine and material body and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Before I discuss the haptic aspects of Mies 's architecture in relation to issues of gender , I must first briefly summarize his formal evolution in terms of Reigl 's system of analysis . In Late Roman Art Industry ( 1901 ) Riegl outlined three modes of spatial comprehension evolving from the early , haptic phase of Egyptian architecture , through the middle phase of hapticoptic Greek architecture , to the faint beginnings of an optical architecture during the Late Roman period . The middle or haptic-optical phase of Mies 's career , between 1927 and 1937 , includes the Barcelona Pavilion and the Tugendhat House , which contain the most celebrated female statues . These two projects encapsulate Mies 's pursuit of non-mimetic form that takes him away from his earlier exploration of immanent materiality . This shift in concerns from the " **26;32;TOOLONG " to the " idealist and aesthetic " ultimately led him to the optical phase represented by the Farnsworth House . <p> The Farnsworth House 's inner sanctum , classical symmetry , white columnar facade , and elevating podium more faithfully represent a Greek temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The house 's attenuated structure and dematerialized enclosure , however , call on a cognitive process radically distinct from that elicited by a Greek temple . The temple 's podium specifically alludes to a grounded foundation ; its columns resist dynamic forces through their own dead weight . The house , on the other hand , floats off the ground and its elastic steel columns appear to be suspended against gravity . From the walled exterior of the Concrete Country House , through his liberation of the wall in the pavilions and Courtyard Houses , and on to the final removal of the exterior wall in the " 50 x 50 House " and the Farnsworth House , Mies slowly undressed his residences . <p> One might ask , however , if Mies , in keeping with the tenets of his own theory , really stripped the building to its skin and bones or if he actually shrouded it in a seductive and shimmering veil of glass ? The qualities of glass partake in both transparency and reflective opacity , enclosure and exposure , the bare and the covered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shields the occupant 's body like a transparent layer of fabric wile , looking at it from the outside in , it protects the building 's internal body like an epidermis . Mies 's notion of naked buildings that encase the female nude constitutes a kind of architectural " strip-tease . " His designs set in motion a visual dynamic that bares the feminine architectural material : the glass is the last veil in a dance that reveals only the most skeletal body . <p> Although Mies rarely explored non-linear forms , he did bracket domestic activities with semi-circular walls in several of his residences including the Tugendhat House . The curvilinear partitions , generally considered an " irrational " shape , refer both to the curves of a woman 's body and to her service role in the domestic sphere . Although the relationship between feminine matter and the " irrationally " curved partition is not as apparent in his strictly orthogonal plans , Mies 's restricted use of the opaque wall to hide and define the sites of cooking , serving , and cleaning , associated these typically feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates the woman 's role in the house with the domestic wall : It is the mother who guarantees the privacy of the home by maintaining its respectability , as essential a defense against outside incursion or curiosity as the encompassing walls of the home itself my emphasis . <p> Mulvey 's comparison of the mother to an encompassing wall and Lyotard 's interpretation of the reflective partition define a fundamental distinction between the opaque and transparent walls in Mies 's residences . While the opaque wall mimics the woman 's body and her role as a protective enclave , the transparent wall consumes her in its reflection and distances her body as an erotic but untouchable object . <p> During the thirties when he became interested in painting and began to propose extensive interior murals to cover the partitions in his houses , Mies further dematerialized the wall . The " House with Three Courts " ( 1934 ) , the Resor House ( 1938 ) , and later the " 50 X 50 House " ( 1951 ) , document his shift from abstract patterns of natural materials to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual surface undermines the sensual experience of mass and encourages an optic engagement with " art " as well as a haptic apprehension of " wall . " The murals cover the wall from edge to edge without any suggestion of an enclosing frame ; the partition vanishes under a thin coat of paint . This absence of a border around the murals that adhere to Mies 's partition walls represents a further attempt to liberate space from haptic feminine enclosures . Is the mural an image or a wall , a functional or decorative element in the design ? A similar conflation of function can be seen in the glass pane . To Mies , no window is transparent . The pane reflects flat images making them look laminated onto the exterior wall . Yet no window is perfectly opaque ; transparency and reflectivity coexist . So the pane allows a transparent view into the deep and penetrable exterior space of nature . Just as he strips haptic elements from his domestic interior , at this stage in his domestic design , palpable materials vanish into thin glass and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural body . His doctrine of " almost nothing " is realized in this effort to extract infinite space and spiritual form from the immanence of base material . <p> Mies 's " bodiless " architecture precludes the possibility of its occupants identifying with the building through physical sensation . In contrast , haptic apprehension would elicit a libidinal habitation of form , a visceral and erotic occupation of architecture that engages space physio-psychologically . To account for such an experience of space , architectural critic Adrian Stokes developed a criticism that incorporates elements of Melanie Klein 's psychoanalytic theory . Stokes compares architecture with the self-sacrificing " good mother " : We partake of an inexhaustible feeding mother ( a fine building announces ) , though we have bitten , torn , dirtied and pinched her ... the bites , the tears , the pinches are miraculously identified with the recipient passages of the body , with sense organs , with features ; as well as with the good mother which we would eat more mercifully for preservation and safety within , and for our own . <p> This allegory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mies 's domestic interior . The building is the offspring of the " good mother " who offers her breast to the infant without regard for her own pain . The tactility of stone allows the building-identified viewer to psychologically bite and tear at the edifice in a satisfying return to the protection of maternal enclosure . In stone and other palpable architectural materials , the thick but invisible gaps between walls that constitute a building 's poche , are like the space hidden within a woman 's body . Interior spaces such as this , imperceptible from the outside , correspond to the hidden sepulcher of Egyptian pyramids that Riegl describes as haptic . Tomb/womb : the secretive space of a woman 's poche is a similarly cryptic space comprehended more through touch than sight . Conversely , optic apprehension supplants physical contact with the phallic gaze and so acquires visual mastery . <p> The fear of poche that characterizes Mies 's architecture and his reduction of haptic elements exaggerates the sensuality of any solid voids that remain . Paradoxically it also limits the occupant 's sense of maternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior : the body is cut out of three-dimensional space and , in effect , laminated onto the glass screen as an element in the flat view of nature . Disembodying architecture by subjugating tactile sensations into retinal impressions , Mies engages the material body of the building as a handmaid to serve his pursuit of pure representation . <p> The pleasure of discussing a Mies residence in relation to gender is bound in transgressions of what may appear a rigid and inflexible rational system . Subtle disruptions render Mies 's spatial construction of gender far more complex than any simple confinement of the woman inside the house or kitchen and release of the man to the workplace or library . Rather than merely supplanting the feminine objects of haptic apprehension with transparent surfaces of optical visibility , Mies contaminates these gender distinctions with designs where feminine and masculine confront one another in the same space . For example , his domestic interiors bear the marks of order and efficiency characteristic of modern office space . He liberates the feminine body from its domestic prison only to reintroduce it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Glass Bodies : The Farnsworth House Revisited <p> The lack of a statue in the Farnsworth House marks the end of Mies 's journey from embodied to specular architecture . Here I want to allegorize this residence as a glass speculum . In the service of scopophilic drives , the architectural speculum transports the woman 's material and tactile body into a glass prism that penetrates her very essence . The specular device destabilizes Mies 's tenuous equilibrium between spiritual transcendence and corporeal immanence and moves the occupant into a space of pure glass . To live in a glass house is to be captured in the light of a cryptic prism . To embody a glass wall is to enter the threatening world of splintered refractions and brittle realities . <p> If , however , Mies 's progression from tactile to optical perception banishes the female figure from the building which culminates in Farnsworth 's flight from her own house , then we are faced with a dilemma . If Mies evacuated feminine forms from this residence , then why does it resemble constructed images of women ? Elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House reflects the masculine image of an Hellenized female who is slender , graceful , and chaste while remaining aloof , strong , and silent . Thus Mies clarifies vision within a rational male design by first eliminating Farnsworth 's body from his orthogonal plans and then inscribing her idealized figure in the glass to animate the architecture . As a feminine figure , the house may seem a kind of living representation of Farnsworth . But Farnsworth objectified into an ideal form , a merging of the object displayed with its display case , becomes only the fetishized reflection of masculine desire . Farnsworth complained with good reason that Mies failed to consider her in his design . He redefines her sexual difference within the house as a function of his own masculinity , reconstructs her as a spectacular reflection of himself . The house reflects Mies 's image of the doctor as a modern woman : self-reliant and abstract , endowed with the sachlichkeit femininity of a trans-sexual being . <p> The house 's specularity , however , did not allow the doctor to view herself . Irigaray 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It constructs man 's transcendence through Plato 's cave , dilates the woman 's body for clinical investigation , and allows women to claim their own form of specularization . There is a risk , though , that the concave speculum might be reinscribed as yet another penetrating device of masculine scopic investigation . It is this very risk that allows Irigaray 's curved glass to serve as a metaphor for the Farnsworth House , a potentially transfiguring appliance which the female occupant can not use . Viewed in terms of Mies 's pursuit of truth in architecture , the Farnsworth House appears as the curved speculum of the cave lifted up from the depths , placed into sunlight , and flattened . Irigaray exposes the ironic " truth " of Plato 's cave as a masculine form of representation based on the simulacrum of a womb containing shadow figures of men cast upon a curved wall . In the Farnsworth House , as in Plato 's grotto lifted into the sun , there are no more " instruments used to effect the magicians ' enchantments , no more fetish-statues with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . " <p> Most revealing , however , the allegory resolves the question of the missing sculpture : the house functions as a speculum that has advanced beyond fetish-statues . Forcing them out of the darkness of illusion and into the painful light of knowledge , Plato liberates his prisoners from the fallibility of sensory cognition to the higher realm of more purely intellectual apprehension . Recapitulating in their pedagogical progress Riegl 's evolutionary scheme , the cavemen advance from the seen to the ideas of the seen . In the Platonic system man is no longer deceived by shadows and is now able to distinguish between appearance and reality . Following the logic of this allegory , Mies removed the fetish statue as a final step toward a truth pursued through the looking-glass of sheer rationality . <p> And yet , as Irigaray warns , this ascent into the light of truth is deluded because " the show still goes on inside " even if the statue has been removed . The light of reason is no more truthful or deceitful than the shadows of the cave . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructing his allegory of truth based upon liberating men from a tunnel and cave that metonymically represent a birth canal and womb . Like Plato , Mies 's architecture of illumination and transparency was founded upon constructions of the feminine cavity as dark and deceitful , as a cave from which the occupant must escape in order to be liberated by the truth of light . <p> Another component within the cave , the paraphragm or boundary that separates the fire from the prisoners , also resolves our earlier question regarding the difference between skin and fabric in Mies 's undressed architecture . In the cave , the paraphragm is a low wall parallel to the front wall on which the shadows are cast . It is across this paraphragm that the puppet figures are marched , the fire behind throwing their images across the wall ahead . In the Farnsworth House the paraphragm is an invisible curtain that envelops the building . It facilitates sight but forbids touch . It is a veil that transforms nature and sculpture into a simulation projected upon a glass screen . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logos of visual cognition as another realm of fantasy and simulation . Clothed in this veneer of representation , the glass is a woman 's liquid skin , shining and perspiring as a living substance , a body with physical sensation imprisoned behind the invisible paraphragm.The glass surfaces that fill Mies 's architecture reunify the fragmented female figure as a narcissistic image of man . Mies intensifies the effect of the gaze over touch by placing these women behind glass walls and enlists haptic understanding in the pursuit of the voyeuristic pleasures of forbidden looking . Turning toward murals and a dissolution of walls , Mies replaces controlled eroticism with iconophobia . He transforms the house into a temple without a cult object - a lack the woman makes good with her own body , transfigured as masculine ideal . Mies positions the female statues in his architecture as objects ; their silhouettes create the void necessary to perceive the spatial solid . As Ludwig Hilberseimer , Mies 's colleague and friend , explains , " Optically we can not perceive unlimited space - only objects make us aware of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feminine lack that continues to haunt her residence . Rather than interpret Cixous 's harsh screams of a shattered glass body as the necessary destruction of the coded " real " and attempt to similarly demolish the Farnsworth House , we must remember that the glass speculum also pierces the woman 's body . To shatter it is to provoke the living cries of our own flesh . The Farnsworth House is a specular instrument for dilating and reflecting the woman 's body ; the possibilities for its reappropriation as a feminist instrument for self-specularization remain , at this time , dormant in the liquid walls and in the tactical space of architectural practice . <p> NOTES <p> 1 .

Schor argues that sexual stereotypes of western philosophy have gendered form as masculine and matter as feminine .

The equation pervades Greek theories of reproduction , notably Aristotle 's . According to his founding myth of sexual difference , woman 's sexual desire only serves to confirm her lack : matter longs for form as its fulfillment , as the female longs for the male .

Freud did not address the possibility of a feminine fetish when he described the origin of fetish as deriving from the little boy 's upward gaze to his mother 's absent ( castrated ) penis .

For a summary of female fetishism see Naomi Schor , " Female Fetishism : The Case of George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contemporary Perspectives , ed . Susan Rubin Suleiman ( Cambridge : Harvard UP , 1985 ) 363-72 . Schor writes : " the question of female fetishism - why it does not exist , what its clinical specificity would be if it did - is one that elicited only sporadic interest in the literature of psychoanalysis ... The major theoretical stumbling-block for these analysts is the Freudian equation : fetish=maternal penis . Dudley attempts to circum vent this obstacle by dephallusizing the fetish altogether arguing that the fetish may ... be a substitute for other infantile objects besides the penis ' " ( 365 ) . Also see Emily Apter 's discussion of Mary Kelly 's interpretation of the female fetish . Kelly interprets the woman 's fetish as motivated by a post-partum desire that seeks to replace missing love objects such as the fetus and grown child .
