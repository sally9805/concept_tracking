Crimson Shadow : Section One " What you doin ' there , boy ? " It was six a.m . Socrates Fortlow had come out to the alley , to see what was wrong with Billy . He had n't heard him crow that morning and was worried about his old friend . The sun was just coming up . The alley was almost pretty with the trash and broken asphalt covered in half-light . Discarded wine bottles shone like murky emeralds in the sludge . In the dawn shadows Socrates did n't even notice the boy until he moved . He was standing in front of a small cardboard box , across the alley  --  next to Billy 's wire fence . " What bidness is it to you , old man ? " the boy answered . He could n't have been more than twelve but he had that hard convict stare . Socrates knew convicts , knew them inside and out . " I asked you a question , boy . Ai n't yo ' momma told you t'be civil ? " " Shit ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wore baggy jeans with a blooming blue T-shirt over his bony arms and chest . His hair was cut close to the scalp . The boy bent down to pick up the box . " What they call you ? " Socrates asked the skinny butt stuck up in the air . " What 's it to you ? " Socrates pushed open the wooden fence and leapt . If the boy had n't had his back turned he would have been able to dodge the stiff lunge . As it was he heard something and moved quickly to the side . Quickly . But not quickly enough . Socrates grabbed the skinny arms with his big hands  --  the rock breakers , as Joe Benz used to call them . " Ow ! Shit ! " Socrates shook the boy until the serrated steak knife , which had appeared from nowhere , fell from his hand . The old brown rooster was dead in the box . His head slashed so badly that half of the beak was gone . " Let me loose , man . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length . " Do n't make me hurt you , boy , " he warned . He let go of one arm and said , " Pick up that box . Pick it up ! " When the boy obeyed , Socrates pulled him by the arm  --  dragged him through the gate , past the tomato plants and string bean vines , into the two rooms where he 'd stayed since they 'd let him out of prison . The kitchen was only big enough for a man and a half . The floor was pitted linoleum ; maroon where it had kept its color , gray where it had worn through . There was a card table for dining and a fold-up plastic chair for a seat . There was a sink with a hot plate on the drainboard and shelves that were once cabinets  --  before the doors were torn off . The light fixture above the sink had a sixty-watt bulb burning in it . The room smelled of coffee . A newspaper was spread across the table . Socrates shoved the boy into the chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of webbing next to the weak lightbulb . A red spider picked its way slowly through the strands . " What 's your name , boy ? " Socrates asked again . " Darryl . " There was a photograph of a painting tacked underneath the light . It was the image of a black woman in the doorway of a house . She wore a red dress and a red hat to protect her eyes from the sun . She had her arms crossed under her breasts and looked angry . Darryl stared at the painting while the spider danced above . " Why you kill my friend , asshole ? " " What ? " Darryl asked . There was fear in his voice . " You heard me . " " I-I-I di n't kill nobody . " Darryl gulped and opened his eyes wider than seemed possible . " Who told you that ? " When Socrates did n't say anything , Darryl jumped up to run , but the man socked him in the chest , knocking the wind out of him , pushing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooped the rooster up out of the box .

" " You crazy , old man . That 's a bird . Bird cai n't be nobody 's friend . " Darryl 's words were still wild . Socrates knew the guilty look on his face . He wondered at the boy and at the rooster that had gotten him out of his bed every day for the past eight years . A rage went through him and he crushed the rooster 's neck in his fist . " You crazy , " Darryl said . A large truck made its way down the alley just then . The heavy vibrations went through the small kitchen , making plates and tinware rattle loudly . Socrates shoved the corpse into the boy 's lap . " Get ovah there to the sink an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't have to do it ... " " You better believe I ai n't gon na ...

What you kill it for if you ai n't gon na pluck it ? " " I'as gon na sell it . " " Sell it ? " " Yeah , " Darryl said . " Sell it to some old lady wan na make some chicken . "
