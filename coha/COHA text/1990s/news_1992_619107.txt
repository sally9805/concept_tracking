<p> Don Nelson sat quietly on a sideline last week , watching his team go through a shoot-around practice in San Antonio , when suddenly , out of nowhere , he just about came unglued . <p> " Hey ! " he yelled , fingering some players on the near end of the floor . " You guys got to start making shots . I 'm tired of picking up balls over here . <p> " You goddam rookies , " he yelled , " you put the ball in the basket . Go down to the other end and shoot , you rookies , if you ca n't make shots . " <p> The biggest rookie , Victor Alexander , looked puzzled . <p> Standing just inside the 3-point arc with ball in hand , the 6-foot-10 Alexander looked at Nelson , shrugged and deadpanned : <p> " I 'm making mine . " <p> He was , too . Rising on his toes and aiming , Alexander made shot after long- range shot . His shots were quick-trigger jobs , and soft  --  like a shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed , as if he were giving up the argument that he himself started . <p> " Just look at that , will you ? " he said . " He makes it look so easy . <p> " He 's blessed . It 's so easy for him . He 's a natural . He does n't shoot like a big man and he does n't play like a rookie . A normal guy needs experience , but he has the knack . " <p> And that , in a nutshell , is the problem that Nelson has with Victor Alexander , who with the rest of the Warriors takes on Charlotte this afternoon at the Coliseum Arena . <p> Basketball  --  perhaps even life itself  --  is too easy for him . A rookie on a team whose coach treats most first-year players with disdain , he has broken through to find a position alongside another rookie , Billy Owens , in the team 's finishing lineup . <p> He hit a game-icing , 20-foot shot from the high right wing at Denver on December 26 to help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week in Houston , Alexander did it again , helping the team beat the Houston Rockets , 98-91 , with a late steal against Otis Thorpe and another long-range bomb , this one from the left baseline . <p> In the team 's last nine games , during which they 've gone 7-2 with three victories on the road , Alexander has averaged 22.2 minutes a game , 8.2 points on 53.2 percent shooting and 5.8 rebounds . <p> A LEGITIMATE HERO <p> He has become , in the short span of three months , a legitimate hero along the Warriors ' front line  --  surely the team 's most surprising player in their most surprising season in years . <p> Alexander came on the scene as a relatively late first-round draft pick by the Warriors and has blossomed from a " project " into a legitimate promising player , leap- frogging beyond the usual raft of problems rookies have in this league . <p> And when Nelson sees that shot , or sees how Alexander always seems to be in the correct rebounding position , and how his off-court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kid , his heart does a skip-jump . <p> " He 's got greatness in him , " said Nelson , who in 30 years of playing and coaching in the NBA has seen greatness all over the place . <p> " I see greatness in him . I think he can be one of the best power forwards in the game or a very good center . <p> " The thing is , I want him to see it . I want him to look in the direction that I 'm looking . " <p> Alexander , as of now , ca n't see it . <p> " It 's always been hard for me to judge my own talent , " he said . " I know I can play , but when I came to Iowa State , I never had any idea that I 'd be a three-time All-Big Eight performer , but I was . It 's the same with the NBA . I do n't know how good I 'll be . I feel I 'll be able to contribute on this level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I definitely think he ( Nelson ) sees some potential to my game . Even with him saying that , though , it 's still hard for me to judge my own talent . Hopefully I will be a great player . I 'll be pushing myself to be as good as I can be , like I did when I got to college . I want to do the same thing on the pro level . " <p> Nelson , for one , is going to push all he can . That 's why when Alexander showed up at the draft weighing 309 pounds , Nelson jammed into his contract a weight clause , then convinced him to go to a diet center in Los Angeles over the summer . And that 's why when Alexander 's weight shot up to 285 after reaching 275 in training camp , Nelson yanked him from the starting lineup and slapped a 265-pound target weight as a precondition for getting his starting job back . <p> And that 's why , for no apparent reason to others besides Nelson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is subject to the kind of verbal hounding that Nelson is prone to hand out to players whom he considers underachievers . <p> " With Victor , " said Nelson , " he 's just a natural . The game is very easy for him , and therein lies some of the problem . I want him to think in terms of greatness , and he 's content . That 's a problem . <p> " The issue with his weight is involved in this kind of thing . " <p> NEVER MET ANYONE LIKE NELSON <p> Alexander himself senses what 's going on here , but still , it 's hard for him . Clearly , he has never run up against anyone quite like Nelson  --  not when he was playing at Denby High in his hometown , Detroit , nor at Iowa State under coach Johnny Orr . <p> Rather , basketball was woven into his life naturally , by his father , Richard , who played basketball as a kid , and by an older brother , also named Richard , who played at Morehead State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , Alexander began to realize in high school that he might be riding on a very good wave indeed . <p> " I grew up in a tough neighborhood , but I had good parents and never really wanted for nothing , " Alexander said . " The main thing is that I just always wanted to get my mother to a nicer place , a nicer home . That 's the thing that always pushed me . " <p> In high school , Alexander was not heavily recruited by college coaches , despite averaging 22.2 points and 15.4 rebounds as a senior at Denby . Alexander attributes the lack of interest to the fact that Denby just was n't very good for any of the years he played there . <p> Thus when Orr offered him a scholarship , Alexander jumped at the chance . <p> Four years and several collegiate accolades later , Alexander was ready for the pros  --  even if the pros were n't ready for him . <p> Indeed , the game came so easy to him that practically nobody even noticed him . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams in the NBA certainly saw his talent , but in the draft , they passed on him for other reasons , " Nelson said . " He was considered to be a fat , lazy player in college and I think it cost him position in the draft . " <p> Nelson , drafting at No. 17 in last year 's draft and already having drafted Old Dominion 's Chris Gatling at No. 16 , pounced on Alexander . <p> " I was hoping we could get through that ' fat and lazy ' thing with him , " Nelson said , " that we could get him to be where we wanted him to be  --  at 265 . " <p> The draft pick was , and continues to be , a gamble . Nelson sees greatness in Alexander  --  but he also sees a parade of current and former players who somehow never measured up to expectations . <p> THE DUCKWORTH EXAMPLE <p> There is , for example , Portland 's Kevin Duckworth , who perhaps is closest to Alexander 's makeup in terms of outside shot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nelson said , " and now he 's what , 20 pounds overweight ? And he 's having his worst year . So do you think he 'd lose weight ? That 's what I worry about . That 's what I do n't want to have happen . <p> " I 've seen players with great abilities fail , and never make it , and I 've seen a lot of them never achieve what they should have achieved , and I do n't want him to be one of those guys , " Nelson said . <p> " The biggest crime for any athlete is not to get the most out of his ability . The sky 's the limit with that guy . I 'm asking more out of him than maybe I do with somebody who does n't have the skill he has . The whole thing is trying to get the most he can out of his body . " <p> Time , of course , will tell whether Alexander will join the ghosts in the dining room , or become the NBA 's Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far , he 's doing all right  --  better , actually , than practically anybody thought he 'd do . <p> Everybody , that is , except Nelson .
