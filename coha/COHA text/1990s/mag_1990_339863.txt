In the brutal war between the government of President Virgilio Barco Vargas and the Medellin cocaine cartel , the drug lords have scored the latest hit . Last week the cartel 's paramilitary group , the " Extraditables , " claimed responsibility for the Dec. 20 abduction of investment broker Alvaro Diego Montoya , 36 , the son of Barco 's closest political adviser , general secretary of the presidency German Montoya . <P> The Extraditables also said they had seized at least two dozen other prominent citizens . According to reports in two Bogota newspapers , the abductions were ordered by drug boss Pablo Escobar Gaviria , who is still on the run following a close escape from the law on Nov. 23 . <P> For four months the Barco government has waged a campaign to shut down drug operations . Last week the government raised the reward for information leading to Escobar 's capture to more than $500,000 . Police read the kidnapings as a warning to Barco to halt the expropriations of kingpins ' property and the extraditions of drug lords to the U.S.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
