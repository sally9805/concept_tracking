<p> Like Olympic judges evaluating a figure skater 's every lutz and triple toe loop , the nation 's major bond-rating agencies have examined every political and economic facet of California and concluded that the Golden State no longer deserves the gold . <p> Last week , Fitch and Moody 's Investor Service followed the lead of Standard &; Poor 's and stripped California of its gilt-edged credit rating . Both brought the state down a half-notch : Moody 's from Aaa to Aa1 and Fitch from AAA to AA+ . In mid-December , S &P; cut its rating a full mark , from AAA to AA . <p> The lower rating is expected to cost state taxpayers $ 4 million to $ 8 million a year over the next three years , because bond issuers have to pay investors more to get them to buy less credit-worthy bonds . Yet to the typical Californian , the bond rating process is as inscrutable as Olympic judging . <p> Instead of posting 6.0s and 3.2s , bond raters assign letter grades ranging from triple-A ( highest quality ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said S &P; Vice President Christopher Irwin , " is how likely the issuer is to pay off in full and on time . " <p> The nation 's two major bond rating agencies  --  Moody 's and S &P;  --  both grade corporate , as well as " municipal " bonds , which are issued or sold by state and local governments and government agencies . Both firms have just one U.S. office outside their New York headquarters  --  in San Francisco . The third agency , Fitch , is becoming more aggressive but is still a small player . <p> The rating agencies are paid for their opinions by the bond issuers , but take pains to remain impartial to lobbying by customers who would like a higher rating . <p> Irwin said he often encounters " gentle , sometimes not-so-gentle arm-twisting " by corporate and government debt issuers . <p> Renee Boicourt , a vice president with Moody 's in New York , said " there was a lot of pressure " from State Treasurer Kathleen Brown and other officials to prevent California 's recent downgrade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly could , " she said . <p> The ratings process usually starts when an issuer asks for a rating on an upcoming bond issue . S &P; rates municipal bonds only on request , but rates all corporate bond issues over $ 50 million if they are sold to the public . Moody 's usually rates on request , but will on occasion rate corporate and municipal bonds without a request , if there is sufficient market interest . <p> After an initial meeting with the issuer , one or more bond analysts assemble a wide range of information about the entity . <p> For municipal bonds , S &P; looks at information from the issuer , census data , information vendors like Data Resources Inc. and its own files . <p> Moody 's Boicourt said she analyzes " financial reports , the prospectus ( or offering document ) and studies that may have been done by watchdog agencies . We 'll also talk to legislative analysts , bank economists and academics . " <p> Among the factors municipal analysts look at : <p> * Debt capacity , including how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much debt has been approved by voters but not yet issued , and how affordable the debt is . <p> * Demographic data , such as household income , population growth and diversity of employers . <p> * Financial history : How conservative are the budgets and how closely does the issuer stick to the budget ? <p> For corporate bonds , the raters rely heavily on information filed by the issuer with the Securities and Exchange Commission , as well information provided by the company . Key criteria corporate bond analysts consider : <p> * Industry data . Is the industry stable or cyclical ? Is the company a leader or follower in its sector ? <p> * Financial data . Analysts look at various measures of profitability and cash flow . They also consider how many times the company 's earnings will cover its interest expense , and its debt relative to equity . <p> * Management . " This is the big qualitative factor , " said Edward Emmer , an S &P; managing director . " We look at how well management has done compared to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Emmer noted that bond analysts work much like stock analysts , " except that stock analysts are a lot more concerned about short-term results . We take a longer-term approach . Also , stock analysts look at upside potential , we look at downside risk . They look at what can go right , we look at what can go wrong . " <p> After reviewing the data , the analysts suggest a letter-grade to the agency 's " ratings committee " comprising three to four senior executives . <p> The ratings committee reaches a consensus , and the lead analyst relays the rating to the issuer . " Most issuers know about what they 'll get , " Irwin said . " But they 're not always happy with it . We allow them to appeal it , but only about 1 percent of appeals results in a change of rating . " <p> Within one day of notifying the issuer , S &P; releases the rating to the general public . Once a rating is made , it must be disclosed whether the issuer likes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house for sale becomes public information even if the owner would rather suppress it . <p> PAYING FOR GRADES <p> At Moody 's , the cost of a rating ranges from $ 1,000 to $ 125,000 , depending on the size of the issue and the amount of work involved , Boicourt said . <p> S &P; might charge $ 7,000 for a $ 10 million general-obligation issue or $ 20,000 for a $ 100 million issue . <p> Issuers figure a good bond rating will more than make up for the cost of a rating . <p> Currently , the interest-rate difference between AAA and AA bonds is about 15 to 20 basis points . ( One hundred basis points equals one percentage point . ) <p> For example , on a $ 50 million bond issue , dropping 20 basis points would cost the issuer an extra $ 100,000 per year in interest . <p> Dropping from AA to A would cost an issuer another 25 to 35 basis points . <p> Falling from A to BBB adds another 40 basis points to the interest rate an issuer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Moody 's ) is not considered investment grade , and is off-limits to most institutional investors such as pension funds and mutual funds . Falling below investment grade costs an issuer 75 basis points or more . <p> If an issuer sells new bonds infrequently , the rating agencies will still review the issuer 's existing debt about once a year . This review may result in an upgrade , downgrade or no change in the issuer 's existing debt . <p> IMPACT OF CHANGE <p> If an agency changes an issuer 's rating , it will affect the issuer 's future bond sales , but it wo n't have any impact on the interest rate paid on existing bonds . Nor will it have any impact on existing bondholders , as long as they own their bonds until they mature . <p> However , a ratings change can affect the current price and yield of existing bonds that are trading on the open market , and this can help or hurt bondholders who must sell their bonds before they mature . <p> How good are the ratings ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the agencies have a continuing flow of statistics and information that the average person ca n't get , " said Zane Mann , editor of the California Municipal Bond Advisor . <p> Professional investors , however , say that ratings changes are often after-the-fact . For example , the recent downgrading of California debt had almost no immediate impact on the price of the state 's existing bonds . That 's because professional bond investors anticipated the downgrading " one and a half , maybe two years ago , " said David McEwen , a portfolio manager with Benham Group . " That 's when the state 's budget deficit problem really started . " <p> Over that period , California 's outstanding bonds started trading like AAs , even though they were still rated AAA . <p> McEwen uses ratings as a starting point . " But not all AA bonds are alike , " he said . " We do our own analysis and try to buy AA bonds that are trading like AA bonds , but really have the credit quality of an AAA bond . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies have become tougher on issuers since the 1970s and early 1980s , " when they had a tendency to take a rosy view of everything . " <p> The turning point , he said , came in 1983 , when the Washington Public Power Supply System ( nicknamed Whoops ) defaulted on $ 2.25 billion worth of nuclear-plant bonds . At the time , the bonds still had investment-grade ratings . <p> Irwin admits that the so-called Whoops debacle " was an embarrassment to all the ratings agencies . " But he said most historians believe that the default was " politically motivated " and could not be adequately foreseen . <p> The rating agencies point out that they 've also been right on many issues . When now-bankrupt R.H. Macy &; Co. did a leveraged buyout in 1986 , S &P; slashed its bond rating from AA to CCC+ . " We did n't like the LBO from the beginning , " Emmer said . <p> Bond traders say that S &P's; and Moody 's ratings on any one issue are usually within a half-grade of each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Joseph DuCote , managing director with Gruntal &; Co. , said that S &P; seems to be a little more " circumspect " than Moody 's . <p> Currently , S &P; has rated only five states triple-A , compared with nine for Moody 's . And in 1991 , Moody 's upgraded more municipal bonds than it downgraded , while S &P; downgraded seven times more municipal issues than it upgraded . <p> DuCote said that S &P,; which is owned by McGraw-Hill , is also a bit more forward-looking than Moody 's , a subsidiary of Dun &; Bradstreet . " Moody 's is looking out the rearview mirror 80 percent of the time , and out the windshield 20 percent of the time , " while S &P; " is looking 60 percent back , 40 percent forward . " <p> S &P's; Irwin admitted that rating agencies deliberate for a long time before changing a rating . " The nature of government is to be in crisis , " he said . " If we changed a rating every time there was a budget shortfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of no use to anybody . " <p> CHART : <p> JUDGING THE BOND RATINGS Standard &; Poor 's and Moody 's use confusingly similar ratings to grade corporate and municipal bonds . Following are their major bond classification codes and what they mean . . STANDARD &; POOR 'S ( a ) MOODY 'S ( b ) WHAT THE RATINGS MEAN AAA Aaa Highest rating , ability to repay interest and principal extremely strong . AA Aa Very strong capacity to repay interest and principal . A A Strong ability to pay , but somewhat susceptible to adverse economic conditions . BBB Baa Adequate capacity to repay debt , but more subject to bad economic conditions . Lowest investment-grade rating . BB Ba Any bond rated this low or below is noninvestmentgrade or " junk ' and can not be purchased by many institutional investors . Considered speculative . CCC Caa Some protections for investors , but major risks and uncertainties . CC Ca Highly speculative . C C No interest is being paid on these bonds . D  --  Bond is in default . NR  --  Not rated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a + or - to show relative standing within the major rating categories . ( b ) Moody 's ratings may use 1 to modify some ratings : for example , Aa1 is slightly better than Aa , A1 is better than A and so on . . Source : Chronicle Research EC :
