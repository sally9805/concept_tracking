<p> ' CAN you demonstrate , Maitre , that Monsieur Barrabas actually made use of information provided by his wife , to the prejudice of her employer ? " <p> A dozen or so people sit in scattered rows facing the bench . Behind it , four judges , medallions hung around their necks on broad tricolor ribbons , listen to the testimony . The case has been brought by a telecommunications specialist fired for allegedly passing trade secrets to her husband , who works for her company 's competition . A dockworker in bluejeans and sneakers presides . <p> This is the Conseil des Prud'hommes , a tribunal for the settlement of workplace disputes that is unique to France . Any conflict pitting an individual employee against his or her employer is brought first before the Prud'hommes . Four conseillers ( councilors ) - two workers , two employers - judge each case . They are elected and have no advanced legal training , but their decisions are binding . Steady rise in cases <p> Serge Faye , who directs legal services for one of France 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1979 , says the most striking development in the Prud'hommes ' activity has been its extension across all fields of employment . " Whereas in the past , certain branches of industry might have been particularly concerned , now it 's everyone : industry , commerce , the service sector , white-collar workers , too , " Mr. Faye says . <p> In 1991 , more than 200,000 cases were brought before the Prud'hommes and some 148,000 were concluded . These numbers have risen steadily over the last 15 years . <p> Every major town has a Prud'homal council - 279 spread across France . The Paris chamber is in a northeastern neighborhood amid bakeries and cafes . The building is squat and square , made entirely of tinted glass . Its five color-coded floors correspond to the council 's five sections ( administration , commerce , industry , agriculture , and diverse ) . The hearing rooms are spare and clean , decorated only by a bust of Liberty , who looks down from an alcove in the wall behind the bench . <p> The only archaic thing about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old French , prud'homme meant a " prudent man , " a man respected for his character and good judgment . <p> The notion that ordinary men ( and today women ) of repute should judge their peers goes back to the 12th and 13th centuries , when nascent towns were fighting for their autonomy from the landed nobility . One of the clauses often demanded in early town charters was that the burghers be free from the lord 's justice , which was slow , costly , and ill-suited to the new flood of commercial disputes that concerned the burgeoning towns . <p> It was Napoleon who founded , in the Lyon silk works , the institution as it has survived to the present day . At the turn of the 20th century - against a backdrop of economic crisis , violent strikes , and a growing revolutionary trade-union movement - the tribunal achieved its crucial modern elements : universal competence in the domains of industry , commerce , and transport ; women 's eligibility to vote and serve ; and equal division of judges between management and labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employer and past Prud'homal councilor in Fontainebleau , it is this equality that is most impressive about the Prud'hommes . " Parity among the judges , " he says , " imposes an equal dialogue . And that leads to a justice that is less false . " <p> Also critical , in Mr. Sommers 's view , is that the councilors are not legal specialists . " We 're workers and employers first . Only secondly are we jurisprudents . We 're men of good sense and experience . And it really works . " <p> Prud'homal justice is relatively swift : An average case spends between eight and 10 months in the system , slightly less than an ordinary civil suit . A hearing rarely takes more than half an hour , and except in extraordinary circumstances , councilors deliberate and announce their decision immediately . <p> The procedure is free : There are no court charges , except legal fees for those who choose to engage a lawyer . Councilors , who are released from their regular jobs for the time they sit - from four to 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government at a rate equal to their regular salaries . Informal proceedings <p> The proceedings are relatively informal . Parties , especially employees , often speak in their own behalf . The result is a plain - and often animated - dialogue . <p> Every case must pass through a conciliation phase , at which both parties are required to appear in person . One out of every 10 conflicts is settled at that stage . " Conciliation is terribly important , " Sommers says . " It reduces the cost of the proceedings , and it allows civil relations between the parties to be restored . " <p> Given the importance of the Prud'hommes in French life , observers point with concern to the decreasing voter participation in the elections for councilors , held once every five years . In balloting last December , the rate was down to 43 percent among employees . Less than one third of employers typically vote . <p> Part of the reason for the increasing abstention may be that Prud'homal elections serve multiple purposes . Because worker candidates are presented not individually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become a measure of trade-unionism in general , and of the relative strength of the five labor federations . In France , as in the United States , trade unionism is declining . <p> In spite of their bitter rivalry , however , French unions are unanimous in their support of the Prud'hommes . Each has legal-services divisions to handle cases , and several have published guides to the Prud'hommes ' jurisdiction and procedures . They joined in calling on workers to vote in the elections . The unions ' support is shared , moreover , by the main employers ' association , the CNPF ( Conseil National du Patronat Francais ) . <p> " Naturally , " says Alain Gauze , a Marseille delegate to the CGT ( Confration Grale du Travail ) , France 's largest labor federation , " the employers would rather go to court and pay a fine than be faced with a strike ... A legal procedure is easier for them to deal with . " Empowerment for workers <p> Indeed there is some dispute in France as to whether the Prud'homal system undermines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than demand collective rights . <p> Employee councilors and plaintiffs agree , however , that the experience of bringing suit against an employer in a truly equal setting is a profoundly empowering one . <p> Dockworker Andre Rouard , for example , has spent the past year and a half in the vanguard of a nationwide labor conflict that included almost weekly strike actions and occasionally violent confrontations with the national police . But he is equally devoted to his duties as presiding councilor of the Marseilles Conseil des Prud'hommes . " What comes up before the Prud'hommes , " he says , " are issues of legal rights . They need to be defended , too . " <p> Mr. Rouard uses his role in court as a way of imposing his equal status on a society that he says is unwilling to accept it . " I wear my bluejeans on purpose , " he says . " They told me to put on a suit , and the next time I came in with my shirt undone to here . So they gave up . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and precision and renders judgments that are linked tightly to the language of France 's labor laws . <p> Not everyone is happy with the justice of the Prud'hommes . Professional judges call it " amateurish . " Councilors call for more administrative personnel and improved automation . And many unionists wish it were possible to order the rehiring of a worker judged to have been fired unfairly , besides levying a fine . <p> " But that 's a labor-law reform , " says Councilor Faye , " not a reform of the Prud'hommes . It 's a critical question , though . The ability to impose and enforce sanctions other than fines is one of the key issues in French labor law , and French law in general . "
