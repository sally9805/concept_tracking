I read in The New York Times where Luis Alvarez , professor of physics at Berkeley , did this experiment wherein he thought Kennedy 's head was much like a melon . Now this Luis Alvarez did win the Nobel Prize and he did invent detonators for the atomic bomb and he did watch same bomb , nickname : Little Boy , dust off Hiroshima , so you 'd think he 'd 've called it quits . You 'd think he 'd 've had enough science on his hands for one lifetime , but I guess not . He had to go and think of Kennedy 's head being much like a melon . <p> It seems Professor Alvarez thought the high-velocity bullet impacting on a soft target would not give up much energy , but would pierce the target and propel material forward along its path . He and some students set up an experiment in which rifle bullets were fired at melons wrapped in filament tape to see what the laws of physics require . <p> The result was that the melons recoiled in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energized a fast jet of fluid and solid matter in the bullet 's direction producing the backward recoil , the rocket-jet recoil of Newton 's law of action and reaction . This forward jet effect is clearly visible in frame 314 of the Zapruder film and in the Alvarez melon photographs . <p> There 'd been much ado about Kennedy 's head going in a direction one would not expect and this gave credence to conspiracy theories that involve a second gunman . <p> I thought , Shit , I can do that . I got rifles . I got bullets . I can get melons , all kinds of rifles , bullets , and melons . Now , I 'm not fond of melon . Cantaloupes tend to repeat on me much like cucumbers . I 'm not fond of watermelons either . My last memory of watermelons goes back to 1979 . I was working in the nation of Texas , building a power line . In that part of Texas there were miles and miles of watermelons we 'd drive through . The crew would jump off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then as we 'd pass by another crew they 'd all wing the rinds at each other , breaking mirrors , windshields , and opening up heads . Let me tell you , a watermelon rind at forty miles an hour can do some damage . They 'd yell insults , too , insults at each other 's mothers who were n't even around . Then things would really get hot . These were the great watermelon wars of south Texas . You might 've read about them . I was there . I ate some of that pink flesh . It was our idea of fun at the time . I ate so much watermelon , I do n't care if I ever see one again . <p> While we 're on the subject , I do n't like physics , either . When I was a kid , my grandmother 's cure for all maladies was a physic . She 'd say , That boy needs a physic . She 'd smile when she said it and head for the kitchen like that 's where everyone keeps their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , energy , motion , and force . I did one time , though , have a substitute science teacher who spoke lovingly of the fourth and fifth dimensions . That was beautiful to hear , but then she never came back . <p> It 's funny how memory can follow you like that , it changing your mind before you 've made it up . I think it 's the way memory lingers quietly in there next door to a lot of low-rent facts long after cause , long after experience or inception . <p> My memory made the idea of shooting watermelons and calling it physics quite appealing . You might say I 'd be killing two birds with one stone . <p> I called my friend Wood . He 's a good shot , able to raise much hell with quail , pheasants , and sporting clay . His name is Wood Gill . I like having Wood Gill for a friend . When I introduce him , I say , This Wood Gill . I say it in a way so as most people mishear it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on the wrong foot . <p> I told him Luis Alvarez wrapped a melon in filament tape and fired rifle bullets at it . <p> He asked if Luis Alvarez did n't have anything better to do , apparently mistaking him for another Luis Alvarez we both knew and mistrusted . <p> I said , " He did already invent the atomic bomb , drop it on Hiroshima , and win the Nobel Prize . " <p> Wood said , " Well , why did n't he name it the Alvafez Bomb if he invented it ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I said , " but this thing with the melon . It proves why Kennedy 's head went in the direction of the rifle as opposed to the direction of the path of the bullet . " <p> Me and Wood had talked about seeing the Oliver Stone movie , JFK , that was getting so much play on the television , but it costs over six bucks a head and that buys a lot of bullets and melons . <p> He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about it ? " <p> " Do n't play with me , " ! said . " Come along . " <p> I go easy with Wood . He 's just coming back into the world . In 1980 he went inside his house because he 'd shot another man and he did n't come out until 1989 . He 'd seen the video In Country and thought going to the Vietnam memorial was the thing to do , a way to come back , but he did n't feel anything the way they did in the movie . He did n't feel anything . He felt nothing . <p> He told me afterwards there was this woman sitting on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial . He could see up her dress . He 'd come to the Capitol to see the sights , but he did n't reckon on seeing that . He told me she did n't look to be a loose woman , but she did have on these red shoes and a short red skirt , so he thought she could be either way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay there forever . He hoped he was n't menacing . He prayed she would n't catch him looking at her , because between her tan thighs it was so dark and he wanted time for his eyes to adjust . <p> The man Wood killed was a black man named Lloyd Kuntz . It had nothing to do with him being black and all . It was that he was a salesman and somehow he 'd crossed Wood 's threshold without calling out . Wood shot him . Some say Wood shot him on the front step . Some even say he shot him in the yard and then dragged him inside . That 's just being smart . If you have shot someone you should drag him inside your house and say that 's where he was shot . It makes things a lot more simple . That 's about all for history and advice . <p> I met up with Wood at The Three Pines in Mount Holly . It 's where I met him for the first time , late at night , long after last call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who carried a spring-loaded nightstick that 'd leap to extension at the push of a button . In his hands , it surely was a stick of night . I 'd seen him drop a few drunks , a few of the obstreperous . Wood wanted a beer and the young guy said no . I 'd taken an immediate liking to Wood when he walked in the door , so I clued him in and gave him my emergency six-pack I keep in the trunk next to the spare and the flares . <p> Wood pulled in beside me , our vehicles aiming in opposite directions so we could talk out our windows . <p> He said , " So no school today ? " <p> " No . Not today . " <p> " That 's right , " he said . " You teach at the college . How many hours is it you teach ? " <p> He likes to hear how many hours I teach . I tell him eight or nine a week . I tell him I meet with students , too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill of his cap and tromped on the gas . His engine had been racing and now it stopped . <p> " You do n't write dick , " he said . " You call me up on the phone , talk a little and then you make up shit . You 're not a writer . You 're a tape recorder . " <p> Little did Wood know that he 'd just stumbled across the latest in literary critical theory . At least I think it 's the latest . Things in that field are happening as fast as the printers can go . I myself have trouble keeping a straight face about a machine called a laptop . One time , though , I did go to the Modern Language Association Conference . It was in Washington , D.C. The Maharishi Yogi was holding a press conference in the basement . I hung out for a while hoping to see what he looked like , but his gunmen chased me away . <p> " Come on , " I said . " Let us go out to the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns . " <p> " Sounds like a party , " Wood said . <p> Wood does n't work much , either . He got hit in the head . He 's certified crazy . So he , too , was free for the day . <p> He followed me to Dillsburg , ghosting along behind . I watched him in the rearview mirror . He 'd pull at his cap and sip from a Styrofoam cup . He drove with one hand . I was glad he was coming , otherwise I wouldn't 've had the courage to go . <p> It was a weekday morning in January and nobody was at the range to ask us questions . We took out the melons , cantaloupes , and wrapped them in duct tape . I should say here we used duct tape because I did n't know what filament tape was and as I write this I still do n't know , and do n't care . <p> They were small melons . That 's to say they were n't very big melons . They were the size of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd brought a watermelon , too , but I had that hid . I was saving it for a kind of surprise . <p> I 'm reminded by myself here that there was another time I had with a watermelon . I was a senior in high school . We took out a plug and spiked it with vodka . We took it into English class for an end-of-the-year occasion . The teacher 's name was Mr. Butler . He 's still in the world someplace but where , I 'm not sure . Could still be teaching high school English . He loved literature . He had a small head , too . ! remember I studied hard for his final exam and I got an A on it . He was very appreciative , like I 'd done it for him and I guess I did . It was rough sledding , though , too rough to turn into a habit . It 's how I got through school . I scuffed along , trying to turn it into something of my own . Even now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should tell them to fail more often . It will be good practice for life , for the work . It 's something they should get used to . Even though I should , I do n't , because failure is easier to learn when you 're alone , when no one is around to bring it to your attention . <p> We set the melons out fifty yards . We stacked shot bags on the bench to make a gun rest . <p> " Do you want to be the scientist , " Wood said , " or do you want me to ? " <p> " Oh , you go ahead . you 're a better shot than I am . " <p> It 's right here where I should stop and get something off my chest . One time me and Wood were hunting cockbird and one came running out of the sorghum into a grass alley I was walking . I was n't thinking and I shot that bird on the ground . Wood was real quiet and in his quietude let me know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasty bird but I made myself eat it . No , that 's not true . It was a tasty bird , but I did n't let myself enjoy it . Actually , that 's half true . <p> Wood shot the first melon and I wanted to ask him if he felt more like Lee Oswald or Luis Alvarez . But he would n't understand , because he always feels like himself . <p> What 'd you see , " I said . Wood can see a bullet hit , much in the same way Ted Williams could see the bat hit the ball . Myself , I used to carpenter and when you were firing on all cylinders , say it in August , say late in the day 's heat , you could see the shank of the spike shiver its way into the lumber . This would 've been artistic and all Zen-like if it had n't been New Hampshire . <p> " Nothing , " Wood asid . " I did n't see nothing . " <p> I know what you 're thinking , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because people who use double negatives simply mean it twice . Wood means he did n't see nothing . <p> " Shoot another , " I said . " Try the aught-six . " <p> I watched those melons go down one after another . I kept asking him what he 'd seen and he kept telling me nothing , nothing at all . I 'd push him , but it was like pulling teeth , like getting blood out of a stone . <p> It just comes down to the fact that the truth is the truth . There 's a lot of difference between a melon and Kennedy 's head . For instance , nobody remembers where they were the day Luis Alvarez shot the melons . Plus Kennedy had that beautiful wife . The melon does n't leave behind a beautiful , grieving widow who goes on to become a book editor and comes to know my name because of a book review I write one time . Of course , I 've always known of her and always felt much sympathy and compassion for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did see John Connally . He came into the bar I was in and I 'll be damned if he did n't order milk . John Connally does n't know me from a bag of assholes . <p> " What I get a kick out of , " Wood said , " is how the guy who invented dynamite gave a prize to the guy who invented the bomb . " <p> " It 's not like that , " I said . " Nobel is dead so he could n't give the prize himself and Luis Alvarez did n't invent the bomb . He invented a detonator . What he got the prize for , I do n't know . " <p> " Oh well , by Jesus . Their hands are clean then , are n't they ? " <p> " There 's a lot of responsibility to go around . There 's a lot of evil in the world . " <p> " You lied to me , " he said . <p> " Yes , I did . Think of it like the government . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What good ? " <p> " I have n't figured that out yet , but when I do , you can be assured I 'll tell you . " <p> " No matter . We 'd best sashay on out of here before some of those save-the-melons folks show up . I 'd hate for there to be a confrontation . " <p> I collected my guns and loaded them into the trunk alongside the watermelon . I 'd spent an hour out there and now I was leaving the shot melons to rot . I 'd spent an hour out there with Wood , a guy I had made up . I 'd made him up for purposes of shooting melons and did n't like the idea of bringing him back to where I lived . <p> Later , as I drove the rolling hills , piloted my car parallel to the creek , I considered how Luis Alvarez thought Kennedy 's head was much similar to a melon . Now I 'd agree we 've had presidents where one could assume as much , but it was never my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was like a melon , and while we 're at it , back in ' 45 , if Luis Alvarez was so goddamn smart , could n't he hear the earth sigh when they dropped that atomic bomb ? Did n't he get to see the birds ignite in the air , the people 's internal organs boil away , the schoolgirls struck blind , riddled with glass , and burned to char ? Could n't he feel some of the fifty thousand degrees , see at least one of the seventy-eight thousand souls ? <p> War drove those scientists , but all along it was truth they were looking for . Can we ever be so fond of truth again ? Would we take our killed into our house for any reason ? <p> Wood punched me in the arm , called me Hoss , said he did n't look forward to my moody company . <p> " This is something we should n't ought 've done , " he said . " It 's disrespectful . " <p> " I know , " I said and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know where he is , but I 'm not telling nothing . <p> <p> By Robert Olmstead <p> Robert Olmstead was born and raised in New Hampshire .
