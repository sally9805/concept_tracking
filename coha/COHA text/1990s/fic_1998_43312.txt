New discoveries confer new abilities-but the best ways t use them ? are not always what you 'd think . Photograph <p> Jack hated offices , especially the offices of scientists working in government laboratories . Such sterile , antiseptic places . He had difficulty believing that intellectual stimulation could come out of such bland surroundings . He hated jackets and ties as well , but had felt obliged to wear a suit to this late Monday afternoon appointment . Every few seconds , he would notice his hands fidgeting at his visitor 's badge , and he would pull at his tight collar in an effort to make himself less nervous and more comfortable . It did n't work . Most of all , he hated waiting . A secretary had let him into the project director 's office , but fifteen minutes had passed since then , the afternoon was slowly approaching evening , and still the project director had not arrived . Finally , the door opened , and Dr. Anita Zahn walked in . Jack felt glad now for the formal way he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black hair , and she wore a red suitjacket . " Sorry to keep you waiting , Mr. Levinson . We had a problem with the Gate . " Jack stood as Dr. Zahn walked around him , then resumed his seat when she sat down behind her desk . " It 's OK , " he replied . " I hope the Gate 's fine . " " She regarded him with pursed lips for a moment , then said , " The Gate is operating normally . Now what can I do for you ? " Her businesslike manner put Jack on his guard . " Dr. Zahn , do you know who I am ? " She nodded . " You do n't get to be the head of the Gate project without being briefed on its history , Mr. Levinson . You were the local math teacher from Waxahachie High School present at the formation of the first Einstein-Rosen bridge , a few years ago . " " Two years ago , " Jack corrected her . " And there 's more to the story than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . Tragic . Tragic . Was that the sum total of Daniel 's life and death ? One word ? Tragic ? Jack thought back to that October afternoon , when Daniel and he did what they did every Sunday : bicycle around the ring of the old , abandoned Superconducting Supercollider . Well , it certainly was n't abandoned anymore . The explosion in the ring that had killed his friend led the scientists to discover another universe , one in which the SSC was operating and leaking antimatter into this universe . Suddenly , the two different SSC experiments had become hotbeds of activity , in both particle physics and the attempt to build stable Gates to other universes . Particle physics had made great strides , but to date , no other universes had been found . And it had all started because of the death of Jack 's best friend , Daniel Strock . " Doctor , " Jack said slowly , " it 's because of my friend that I wanted to see you . " She nodded . " Please continue . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great contrast to the politeness Jack had experienced from the other scientists two years ago . Well , if she could be direct , so could he . " I need to use the Gate . " " You need to use the Gate , " she replied evenly . " Yes . " " Because of your friend . " " Yes . " She sighed . " Mr. Levinson- " " Jack , please . " " Jack . " She smiled momentarily , then frowned . " I 'm afraid that 's impossible . " He shook his head . " Hear me out . " " But- " " Just listen , please . " He looked her right in the eyes . After a second , she closed her eyes and nodded . Jack took a deep breath , then spoke . " Dr. Zahn , how old do you think I am ? " Zahn seemed surprised by this question , but answered , " I do n't know . Thirty ? " " Close . I 'm twenty-seven . And in all that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . And that was Daniel . " Jack stood up and paced . " We had a unique friendship . We grew up together in New York , but never liked the feel of a big city . We went off to two different small town colleges and drifted apart , but kept in constant touch by phone and e-mail . We both loved and studied math , and when we had a chance to end up teaching together here in Waxahachie , we took it . " Jack stopped pacing . " We really enjoyed a lot of the same outdoor activities , like hiking , or-or bicycling . And two years ago , when I saw Daniel die in that explosion-for a while there , I did n't want to go on . " He sat down again and leaned forward . " But one thing kept me going . The scientists working on the project apparently had doubles in the other universe . I remember , when they invited me to be present at the time of first contact , that the SSC director here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe , just maybe , my friend Daniel was still alive . In the other universe . " He rubbed his eyes and sighed . " I want your permission to go into the other universe , to look for him . I want to see my friend again . I need to see him . " His appeal finished , Jack leaned back , and looked directly at Zahn . She sighed and put on a noncommittal expression . " Look , just because you were there from the beginning does n't mean you have any proprietary rights over the Gate . It 's not like we 're running a travel agency here , or even an importexport business . " She put her hands together and asked , " How much physics do you know ? " Jack shrugged . " A little . I took it in college . But I 'm mostly a math person . " " Well , let me explain it to you in a way you can understand . " Her tone did n't sound like she meant to be patronizing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . Wryly , he thought that she could use a lesson or two on how to teach . She continued . " First of all , we 're still not even sure how the bridge between the universes formed . Yes , we know that the extremely high energies of the beam broke through the barriers between the universes , but we 've barely even begun to understand the physics behind it . There are so many questions we still need to answer , and the most important one is why we ended up linked with this particular universe . " " Universe Beta , " Jack said . Zahn nodded . " I see you 've been keeping up with the news . We 've never had to name our universe before , so Alpha and Beta became the official designations . Over there , they call them One and Two . " She smiled . " We 're Two , of course . " " Of course , " Jack murmured . " Like I said , we 've barely begun to understand the physics behind the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this phenomenon is also based upon the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics , developed by Hugh Everett at Princeton in the 1950s . Every time a decision is made , the Universe splits into many different universes , and in each one the decision is different . For example , today I ate cereal for breakfast , but in some other universe perhaps I ate eggs . " Jack nodded . " I do watch Star Trek , " he said . Zahn winced ; apparently , that was the wrong thing to say . " Anyway , " she continued , " if Everett 's theory is correct , then already we have the question of why we 're in touch only with this particular universe , and no other . After all , if there are presumably billions of SSCs running beams in all these multiple universes , then why have n't they all leaked into ours ? " Jack tried to salvage his part of the conversation . " Perhaps Universe Beta resonates with ours on some fundamental level . " Zahn 's eyes widened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . But we do n't know what the connection is , and there 's another problem to keep in mind . " She looked Jack straight in the eyes . " Everett 's theory does not allow for actual travel or contact between the universes . " Jack was puzzled . " But we are in contact . If anyone knows that , I do . " Zahn nodded . " That 's exactly the problem . We do n't completely understand why this is happening . But what we do know is that when we send matter through the Gate , it affects the resonances between the universes , effectively pushing them apart . The rate of the separation seems to be proportional to the mass sent through . In other words- " Jack interrupted . " In other words , if you send too much stuff through the Gate , you 'll push the other universe away . " Zahn nodded . " About the only thing that we can trade safely back and forth is information . We do use the Gate on occasion to send small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send a person across . That simply is n't possible . " Jack faced the floor , studying his shoes . " Then you 're saying that you wo n't help me . " She shook her head sadly . " Not wo n't . Ca n't . " After a moment , her somber face brightened . " There is one thing I could do for you . " Jack looked up hopefully . " What ? " " Well , I could ask the other scientists in Beta to search for your friend . We could bring him to the Gate , and you can meet him then . " Jack shook his head and said , " No , thank you . " He did n't bother telling her that her predecessor , Dr. Pratt , had tried to locate Daniel Strock last year , to no avail . Or at least , he had claimed to an effort . Dr. Zahn was obviously not as well briefed as she thought . " In that case . . . " Zahn spread her arms out in a gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to forget about it . Thank you for your time . " He stood up to leave . " Wait , " Zahn said , standing up as well . Hesitantly , she put a hand on his shoulder . " Jack , a piece of advice if I may . " He nodded . " I 'm really sorry about your friend , but-but you really ought to put it behind you . Even if you did find him on the other side of the Gate , it probably would n't be the same . " Jack felt a tear in his eye . " I had to try , " he said . Jack biked home to his apartment , upset and depressed . He briefly considered heading over to Getzendaner Park , to take advantage of the beautiful bike trail , as it was still a lovely afternoon . But after a long day of teaching and the late appointment , he wanted the solitude of home , and given that the Cow Creek Country Classic Bike Rally was coming up next month , there would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lived in a relatively new apartment building , on the same block with some of the gorgeous old houses for which Waxahachie was known . From what Jack had gathered , long-time residents had made a big stink when the huge building was constructed . But it was one of the few places where a young high school teacher could afford to live . At the front door , he removed his helmet , took out his keys , let himself in , and walked his bike into the building . He lived on the first floor , making it easy for him to bring his bike in and out of the place . After getting his mail without looking at it , Jack opened his apartment door and put his helmet and bicycle away in the front closet . He walked into his bedroom , removed his jacket and tie , and changed into sweats and a T-shirt . Then he sat down on the edge of his bed and rubbed his eyes . A few minutes later he stood up and wandered around his apartment , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then back to the living room again . Small place , without many furnishings , but that had never mattered before . Daniel and he had usually gone out places together . They had even double dated once , although that did n't work out . Both Daniel and Jack had felt married to their work , which was usually more than satisfying . But now Jack was n't so sure . He felt discontented with his life . His place , which had always felt cozy before , had most recently taken on an air of loneliness . It pervaded him , making him feel hollow inside . His grumbling stomach reminded Jack that it was close to dinnertime . He briefly considered cooking an elaborate meal-just the kind he had liked to prepare for him and Daniel . But he could n't get up the enthusiasm to do it . Instead , he opened a can of tuna , made a sandwich , and plopped down on the sofa in front of the TV to watch the news . He could n't bring himself to pay attention , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the letters . Junk mail , mostly . People hardly wrote personal letters anymore . But one letter bore the name and return address of Rachel Larsen , an old girlfriend from high school . He opened it and read it with scant attention ; it was mostly about Rachel 's new kid and new job , in that order . But then she got into some more personal stuff which caused him to sit up . . . . you 've been brooding for tuo years now , Jack . I know you do n't have any other close friends in Waxahachie . Perhaps it 's time you came back to Vew York , to your fa ? nill and other friends . You need people around you , people who know and care about.you , and you 're not getting that in le.ras . Jack , let me finish this letter with one question : would Daniel have wanted you to mope around like this ? " Jack read over the last few paragraphs again and again , trying to assimilate Rachel 's words . Leave Waxahachie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a small town , but it had a certain charm to it . If he needed a big city , well , Dallas was but a short drive away . He did n't need to go back to New York ; he just needed his friend Daniel again , impetuous , fun Daniel , who always knew just what to do with life .... Jack drifted off to sleep on the sofa , Rachel 's letter clutched in his hand . The next day , Tuesday , was another school day , and Jack zombied through the day , barely nodding his greetings to colleagues and students in the halls . He always planned out his lessons well in advance , which made it easier to teach on days that he just did n't want to think . In the morning , he taught Precalculus and Algebra II ; his day ended with another section of Algebra II , and Geometry . It was in the middle of that last class that the thoughts came unbidden to his mind . He had just turned his back on the apathetic students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed him as well . What am I doing here ? Do the students really care ? Will I be stuck here teaching Pythagorean Theorem over and over for the rest of my life ? He hesitated , his chalk poised above the blackboard . What could he do ? He had twenty minutes left to class and no choice but to continue teaching , but his heart was n't in it anymore . He gritted his teeth and reminded himself of the few students who did care , the ones who made him enter this profession in the first place . That got him through the class . By the time the bell rang , Pythagorean Theorem had been proven once again . He sat down at his desk and stared out into space as his students shuffled out of the classroom . Except for one . Donald Primrose , one of the better students , gathered up his things and hesitated at the door . Once the rest of the class had exited , Donald turned back to Jack . " Mr. Levinson ? " " Yes , Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it for a while there . " Jack smiled . " I 'm fine , Donald . Thanks for asking . Do n't forget the late homework you owe me . " " Um , OK . " Donald left , and Jack went back to staring into space . He really ought to get up , he thought . Get up , go home , grade papers . . . It all seemed so banal , so unimportant . Jack looked up at his door . If Daniel were still alive , he would come careening in here any second , laughing , joking , suggesting a drive to Dallas or a walk in the park-or something else . Maybe even bungee jumping ; Daniel was always more of a daredevil then Jack . Jack stared at his door for five minutes . It did n't open . With a sigh , Jack got up and collected his things . His friend Rachel was right . He could n't live like this anymore . Not without Daniel . As Jackswunghis pack around on his back . something fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled at the realization that they had never bothered to take it back . The SSC might be a government laboratory , but it was a relaxed one , and security ended to be somewhat lax there . The badge was only good for yesterday , anyway , and Jack picked it up , intent on throwing it out . He brought it to the trash can and hesitated . He studied the badge . The date was handwritten and not very clear . He could use the badge to get back into the facility today , if he wanted . And that meant .. Whistling , Jack stuck the badge in his pocket , and headed home . He had to get a picture of Daniel and make a few phone calls . Building G , a small white cube , sat alone in the middle of the dry grassy plain above a section of the actual collider , which was buried underground . As Jack biked towards the building , he remembered that its location was the same as where the breakthrough had first happened , when the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume , allowing the people of the two different universes to communicate directly . The night was cool , a full moon hung high in the sky , and Jack paused for a moment to inhale the clean air . He dismounted and covered the rest of the distance to the building on foot , wheeling his bicycle along with him . The glass door in front was locked , but Jack rang the bell , and in a minute a man came to the door and opened it from inside . " Jack Levinson ? " " Yes , that 's me . " He opened the door wide and grinned broadly . " Pete Gallagher , " he said , and shook Jack 's hand vigorously . " Come in , come in ! It 's eight o'clock , you 're right on time ! " He practically pulled Jack inside , the bicycle dragging along . Gallagher was large , taller and broader than Jack , but his size was mostly due to weight , not muscle . He wore a button-down shirt with the collar open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's get right to it-the Gate 's this way . " He wheezed as they walked down a white-walled hallway , but kept up a fast pace . " Sorry to have bothered you , " Jack said . " No problemo ! You 're a bit of a celebrity around here , you know that , do n't you ? " Jack stopped in his tracks . " A celebrity ? " Gallagher continued walking , forcing Jack to do the same . " Yeah , well , I mean , as you were the first one to see the universes converge . I 've always wanted to meet you . That 's why I was so glad when you called this afternoon . So they 've never let you see the Gate before ? " " No , " Jack said , and then did something he hated . He lied . " I 'm really grateful to Dr. Zahn for letting me see it tonight . " " Yeah , she 's aces . Not like Dr. Pratt . He kept a tight fist on everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He agreed that Pratt had been hard to deal with , but he had offered what help he felt he could . Of course , Zahn had done the same , and if she had n't been the current director , it probably would have been much harder for him to convince Gallagher that he had permission to see the Gate . They stopped at a door . Gallagher took out his passkey , and started to slide it through the electronic lock when he slapped himself on the forehead . " Oh , I forgot ! I have to see your badge . " He shrugged . " Regulations , you know . " Jack nodded and showed the badge to Gallagher . He quietly breathed a sigh of relief when Gallagher gave it a cursory glance , not even taking it for a closer look . " OK . " He grinned . " I should probably warn you that the Gate is an impressive sight , but you 've already seen the effect before , have n't you ? Here we go ! " He slid his passkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud click . They entered the room . Gallagher headed over to a control panel on the nearby wall while Jack took in the sight at the center of the room . The Gate looked nothing like a gate . Jack had been expecting a normal rectangular-shaped doorway , the size of a person , through which the other universe would exist just like another room . Or perhaps it would appear to wobble and ripple , like the other universe did the first time they were truly brought together . The Gate was something entirely different . It looked as if a sphere of electrically charged air or water hovered in front of them . It sparkled , it crackled with noise . The other side of the room was only visible around it ; inside , it appeared to be nothing but a mass of turbulence , a trapped ball of lightning , thunder , and wind . " Wow , " Jack whispered . He could barely hear himself over the noise . Gallagher grinned at him . " Sorry we ca n't turn it off , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we close the connection , we may lose contact permanently . And I 'm not just talking about Dr. Zahn . This comes from on high . " " How does it work ? " " What do you mean ? " " Well , is it safe to go into that ? " Gallagher laughed . " Scared of all the special effects ? Relax ; the Gate turbulence ca n't harm anything . At least not as long as we 're controlling it from right here . We pass stuff through all the time . " " Really ? " That did n't seem consistent with what Dr. Zahn had told him . Could she have been lying ? " Like what ? " " Oh , notebooks , equipment , thing like that . Anything that will help us un derstand the Gate . That 's how we wort with the other scientists , in Beta . " " Do-do people ever go through ? " Gallagher fiddled with a few control before replying . " Very rarely , although all of us techs have been through at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilling rollercoaster ride . " He looked around conspiratorially . " Would you like to through ? " Could it be this easy ? " Really ? Do yo mean it ? " Gallagher grinned and shook hi head . " Nah ! I really ca n't let you . Yo understand . Jack felt deflated . " Sure . Sure , understand . Gallagher nodded and turned back to the control panel . In a moment , Jack knew , Gallagher would suggest that Jack leave . After all , his lie only covered the chance to see the Gate , and now that he had , there would be no other excuse for him to stay . It was now or never . Offering up a quick prayer that he would n't hurt any , one on the other side , Jack lifted his bicycle and , with all his might , heaved it into the Gate . It hit the boundary of the sphere , crackled , fizzled , warbled , and vanished . Gallagher reacted to the quick change in the noise from the Gate . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jack had no time . He shouted , " My bicycle got sucked in ! I 'll go get it ! " and jumped . If the Gate seemed scary before , what happened next was positively terrifying . Jack remembered the only time he had actually seen a small portion of the two universes come together . The people of the other universe had seemed transparent and insubstantial . Their bodies had appeared to stretch and compress , as if space were a wave moving through them . Now , that seemed to be happening to Jack himself . It confused him , because he knew that what he had seen before was merely visual , an effect of the two universes merging temporarily . But that was no longer the case . He felt his own body stretch and distort , making him long and thin , then short and fat . It was like being a rubber doll , tossed around by the eddies of the Gate . He felt like he would vomit , but he had lost the sense of his own body . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white sparks , surrounded by overwhelming noise and bright light . He tried to concentrate , to focus on anything , but there was nothing around him . nothing at all . Time seemed to stop , and it seemed to go on forever . Space expanded , space contracted . The Universe ended , the Universe was born . Presently , Jack became aware of his own breathing . Slowly , feeling returned to his body , first to his legs and feet , then to his arms and hands , and finally to his head . His eyes snapped open into a bright light , which made him blink a few times to clear the sudden tears . After a moment , he realized he was lying on his back upon a cold concrete floor . The bright light was the Gate , floating above him and to the side , looking exactly the way he remembered it . He stood up quickly and looked around . The room looked exactly the same , but with two minor differences . Off to one side , his bicycle lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere to be seen . Jack walked over to his bicycle as quickly as he could , but carefully . He felt slightly dizzy , presumably an aftereffect of jumping through the Gate . He righted the bicycle , walked it over to the door of the room , then stopped short and laughed . He was heading towards the wall . The door was on the other side , in this version of the room . He shook his head , turned around , and exited the room . Fortunately , there was no one else around in the hallways . It had been a gamble , but it had paid off . When Jack had called the main number for Building G back home in Universe Alpha , he was counting on the fact that the building would normally be unstaffed at night . Pete Gallagher had been the only one around shortly after 5 PM , and he agreed to let Jack come visit after Jack 's lie about having Zahn 's permission , a lie which could n't be checked until tomorrow . Well , the Building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made Jack 's life that much easier . He imagined what it would have been like for him had he emerged into the middle of a normal workday , with technicians everywhere , doing experiments , and he shook off the shudder of how quickly they would have sent him back . Come to think of it , after that weird passage , he was n't sure he ever wanted to go back . It was similar to his fear of flying . He would n't mind being home again ; he just did n't want to have to pass through the Gate to get there . Jack quickened his pace to the building 's exit . Although he did n't think that Gallagher would follow after him immediately , the possibility was still there . He emerged into a clear , cool night , similar to the one he had left behind on the other side . The moon was even full , although it hung slightly higher in the sky , which made sense given how long Jack had been unconscious . Jack inspected his bicycle for damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so Jack mounted it and headed towards town . Specifically , he headed towards a motel he knew was located a short ride away from the school . Obviously , Jack could n't head " home , " as his apartment was probably occupied by someone else in this universe . But he had already acknowledged and prepared for this problem . He would stay at a motel tonight , head over to the school tomorrow , and begin asking around for Daniel . Less than an hour later , he arrived at the location of the motel , and had a small surprise . The motel looked the same . but it sat on the other side of the street from the one he expected . Jack shrugged . A minor inconvenience , nothing more . He crossed the street , locked his bicycle to an outside post , and entered the motel . The lobby was a tiny room with two tables and a desk , at which sat the clerk , a young man with nicely combed black hair and a nametag on his red jacket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tinkle of a bell . " Good evening , may I help you ? " " Yes , I 'd like to rent a room for-for the next two nights . " That should be long enough . " Certainly , sir . " The clerk consulted the computer in front of him and hit a few keys . " And how will you be paying for this ? " " Visa . " He handed over his credit card , and the clerk ran it through the computer . After a moment , the computer beeped and he gave Jack a funny look . " Sorry , it does n't seem to be valid , " he said , and he handed the card over . Puzzled , Jack took it and said , " Oh , well , then I 'll just pay cash . " He reached into his wallet to take out some bills , and paused with his hand around a twenty . It suddenly hit him that his credit card did n't work in this universe ; what guarantee did he have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : absolutely none . The credit card was one thing , but if the clerk decided that his money was no good , Jack could easily find himself locked up in a jail for the night , trying to explain why he had tried to pass off such obviously fake money as the real stuff . He stuffed his wallet back into his pocket , mumbled , " Never mind , " and rushed back into the cool night . Where could he go now ? As he unlocked his bicycle , he first considered heading to his apartment building . Maybe his keys would work , and the current resident might be out of town , and he could No . That was both stupid and dangerous . At the very least , he might get arrested for breaking and entering . At the very worst , another version of himself might live there , and he 'd have a hard time explaining his presence . Perhaps he could check a phone book for Daniel 's name . After all , if he could find Daniel tonight , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work either . Jack knew that Daniel did n't live in Waxahachie Beta , at least under the name of Daniel Strock , because that was something Dr. Pratt had checked for him . The motel looked like the best bet , and maybe , just maybe , his money would be good here after all . Perhaps the first thing he needed to do was to check his money against local currency A sudden dizziness overwhelmed Jack for an instant , and he braced himself against his bicycle . It passed quickly , and Jack blamed the excitement of the night . But still it frightened him , and disrupted his previous train of thought . He now realized that he did n't want to do much of anything until he found Daniel . Was all this really worth it ? Maybe he should just go back to the Gate and his own universe , apologize to Pete Gallagher , and go home . But then again-Jack took the picture of Daniel out of his wallet , studied it for a minute , and for the umpteenth time read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , and always will be , my friend-Daniel . " He went to Getzendaner Park , and slept under the stars . The next morning , after freshening up and cleaning himself off as best as he could in one of the park 's restrooms , Jack headed over to Waxahachie High School . It was the same , but different . Jack could n't quite put his finger on it . The building looked like the one he knew , and the location was correct , but there was something subtle , something just off , about the place . He thought about it as he locked his bicycle to a post and watched the flow of students into the school . He yawned and stretched once his bi cycle was secure , and joined the throngs of people going into the school . Selfconsciously , he rubbed the stubble on his chin and hoped no one would take too much notice of his slightly disheveled appearance . Fortunately , the buzz of student conversation dominated the interest of the masses around him , and no one paid him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards once Jack was inside , and that was the Mathematics Department . He went to where he expected the office to be , and was relieved to discover that it was in exactly the same location as it was in his own universe . The interior , however , was much different . There were fewer desks against the walls of the small room , and a surfeit of posters on various mathematical subjects . He noticed that his favorite poster , on fractals , was missing . He walked over to the location of his desk , at the back of the room , and hesitated . What if he ran into his other self here ? He chided himself for not thinking ahead . He bent over the desk to see if anything on it or about it looked familiar when he heard a voice from the doorway behind him . " Who are you ? " Jack turned around , and was stunned . A woman carrying a briefcase stood in the office doorway , a woman who was the exact image of his old girlfriend Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazel eyes , and she stood a little shorter than Jack did . It took Jack a moment to find his voice . " Um-I 'm Jack Levinson . I teach Math here . " She raised an eyebrow . " You do ? I do n't recall seeing you at any department meetings . " Well , that answered Jack 's question about whether he might run into himself here . Quickly , he said , " Um , I mean , I used to teach Math here . Once , a-a long time ago . " She closed the distance between them and studied his face . " Could n't have been that long ago , " she said , and smiled . " Um-no , it was n't . I mean , it was a few years . " She extended her hand . " I 'm Paula Eisen . I teach Math here now . " Jack shook her hand carefully , constantly reminding himself that this was not Rachel . " It 's a pleasure to meet you . " " Same here . Now could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack took a deep breath . " I 'm looking for my friend Daniel Strock . He-he used to teach Math here with me . " He reached into his pocket and passed the photograph over . She studied it for a few seconds , then handed it back with a shake of her head . " Sorry . I do n't recognize him . But this is only my first year here . " " Um-right . " Jack had been about to say that that should n't have mattered , but that would have contradicted the cover story he had just established . " Would you excuse me , please ? You 're standing in front of my desk . " " Oh . Sorry . " Jack moved to the side , and a sudden wave of dizziness hit him . The room spun and colored lights danced around Jack 's field of vision . He fell to the floor . " Hey ! You OK ? " Jack recovered almost immediately , but stood up slowly , using her desk chair as a brace . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . " She put her briefcase down on her desk . " It looked like you lost it for a moment there . " " Yeah , well , maybe I did . My apologies . I guess I should go . " Jack turned away from Paula , headed for the door , when she said , " I 'm curious about something . " He turned around . " Um . Yes ? " " Do n't you keep track of your friends ? " " It 's kind of a long story . " He shrugged . " Uh-huh . Whatever you say . " She paused , then said , " Listen , are you sure you 're going to be all right ? " Jack nodded . " Yeah , I think so . I just need to figure out what to do next . " " What to do next ? " " I mean , to find my friend . " " Oh . " She sat down and smiled . " Maybe I can help . " Suddenly Jack felt hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure . But if he did teach here , I suppose I could ask around , see if anyone remembers him . That is what you 're doing , is n't it ? " " Sort of . But I can do this myself , thanks . " " Do you have permission to be in the building ? " Jack remained silent . Paula sighed . aI thought not . Listen , why do n't you go home , rest a bit , and I 'll see what I can find out about your friend . Daniel Strock , is that what you said his name is ? " " Yes , that 's right . " " Good . And in turn , you can take me out to dinner tonight . " It took Jack a moment to understand what she had just said . " Dinner ? " " Well , how else were you going to find out what I learned ? You can pay me back for my help by telling me all about what the school was like when you taught here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled . " Want to pick me up at five ? " " Um , all I have is my bike . " She rolled her eyes . " Fine , I 'll drive . Meet me in front of the school . And do n't worry about your bike ; we 'll be able to lug it along . " Not being able to think of anywhere else to go , Jack spent the day at Sims Library , browsing through childhood books and trying to recover his composure . Paula Eisen seemed to be this universe 's analog to his old girlfriend Rachel , which disoriented him a great deal . He had a lot of trouble imagining Rachel as a math teacher , as she had been more interested in other things and eventually went into the business world . In a way , though , . that would help remind him that Paula was not Rachel , that this woman had an entirely different lifestyle , and perhaps even a radically different life history . At the very least , he had to remember that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At a few minutes before five o'clock , Jack waited in front of the school , his bicycle standing next to him . The street in front of the school was mostly deserted , which made sense , given that the school day had ended almost two hours ago . Paula was right on time . She drove up fast in a red pickup truck , came to a screeching halt , and jumped out . No , thought Jack , she was definitely not like the Rachel he knew . Paula seemed much more impulsive , much more of a risk-taker . Why else would she have arranged to go out to dinner with a total stranger ? " Hello , " Jack said . " Greetings . Let 's get your bike into the back . " The two of them lifted it into the truck , then got in themselves . " Where are we going ? " Jack asked as they pulled out . " I figured we 'd head to Dallas . There 's an Italian restaurant I like , if you have no objection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good . Do you mind if I put on the news ? There are n't enough hours in the day to keep up . " " Sure , go ahead . " Paula turned the radio to a news station , and Jack listened intently to get an idea of how different this universe was from his own . To begin with , he did n't remember this particular station broadcasting news back home , but he did n't say anything . Oddly enough , the news did n't sound too out of place . The name of the president was the same , and the international stories seemed logical , as far as Jack could tell . But then they got to local news , and Jack leaned forward . " Ellis County police are still looking for a man who trespassed onto the Superconducting Supercollider facility late last night and wandered off . Although they report no vandalism or any damage to the collider , police say that the trespasser should be considered dangerous and that if anyone Jack turned the dial , cutting off the announcer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of a country and western song . " Hey ! What 'd you do that for ? " " Sorry . I just got into the mood for some music . " " Well , switch it back , please . " Jack took his time doing so , and by the time he got back to the news station , the announcer was on a different story . Jack spent the rest of the ride silently contemplating his fugitive status . They arrived at the restaurant ten minutes later . It was one of those that hovered between casual and formal . Red tablecloths , large mirrors and the windows facing the road contrasted with classy finished wood furniture and somber prints hanging on the walls . Paula and Jack were shown to a small corner table upon which sat a lit candle in a glass , superfluous given the bright lighting . They ordered dinner . Paula requested a simple plate of spaghetti . Jack felt starved and asked for a lasagna , all the time worrying about how they would pay for the food at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone , Paula began the conversation . Jack desperately wanted to hear if she had found out anything about Daniel , but instead she started by quizzing him on the history of the school . She asked questions about people , courses , and the school grounds . Jack did his best to keep up with logical answers , but hesitated over a lot of what he said . Finally , she laughed and said , " You do n't really know much about the school , do you ? " " What do you mean ? " " I mean , Mr. I-taught-here-before , that your knowledge of Waxahachie High is lame at best . You 've been answering questions about teachers who never existed , for one thing , and giving me nice complete stories about them . You have n't recognized the names of people you should have known had you actually taught there . " Paula leaned forward . " And , finally , the name of your friend Daniel Strock drew a complete blank as far as the Ellis County school system was concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schools in Waxahachie . " She leaned back again . " Just who are you , really ? What 's your story ? " Jack took a deep breath . " You would n't believe me if I told you . " " Try me . " Jack looked around . " Well , for starters , I 'm not really from here . Sort of . I mean , I am and I 'm not . " " Ah . A paradox Jack changed tactics . " What do you know about the SSC ? " " The collider ? Not much . It brought a lot of money into Waxahachie when they decided to build it , but I was n't around then . " " Do you know anything about what happened with the collider two years ago ? " " You mean when they almost closed it ? Yeah , the experiment was n't working for a while , and then they got it to work again . Why ? Do you work there ? " Jack shook his head . Do the names Universe One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now Paula shook her head . " No , should they ? " It became clear to Jack that the federal government of Universe Beta must have kept quiet the events of two years past . Well , he thought bitterly , they could get away with it more easily . It was n't as if anyone had died in this universe . At that moment , the waitress came to their table with their dinner . She set the plates down in front of them , and they began eating . Jack dived in , and with the first swallow his hunger intensified . He had n't realized that he was so ravenous , but that made sense , given that he had n't eaten since yesterday . " Slow down , pardner ! It 's not going to run away from you . " Jack swallowed another mouthful , and gave Paula a sheepish grin . " Sorry . You were right ; this is a great place . " " Thanks . It 's not too expensive , either , another reason why I like to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . " Um . That 's something else . I may need your help paying for dinner . But I promise to pay you back . " Somehow , he added silently . She rolled her eyes . " Do n't tell me ; let me guess . You do n't have any money on you . " " No , I do , it 's just that-well , let me show you . " He took out a dollar bill and passed it over to Paula , who glanced at it and gave it back . " Looks fine to me . " " It does ? I mean , could I see one of your dollars ? " Back at the motel , after that initial wave of dizziness , Jack had frightened himself so much about the possibility that his money would n't be good here , that he had forgotten to check it out . She shook her head , but took her wallet out of her purse . " You 're really weird , you know that ? " She handed over a bill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discernable differences . It was possible that Jack 's money would show up as counterfeit under greater scrutiny , but for routine spending , it would suffice . Too bad he had n't known about that last night . He could have slept in comfort , taken a shower , and eaten lunch . " Looks like my money 's good here after all , " he murmured , and handed Paula 's dollar back . " So you can pay for dinner ? " " Uh , yeah , sure , I guess . I just did n't expect to be able to . " " Which brings me back to my question . What 's your story ? " Jack stared over Paula 's shoulder . " I 'm not from this Earth . " She laughed . " Do n't tell me you 're from outer space ! " " No-no . It 's not like that . I'm-I 'm a visitor from Universe Alpha . I mean , Universe Two . " " Ah . And that 's supposed to make it all clear to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept going . " Look , the reason the SSC stopped working was because the beams leaked into another universe , mine . Maybe that did n't make the news around here , but it definitely made the news in my Waxahachie . There was an explosion . It killed my friend Daniel , and . . " And now you 've come here to see if you can find another version of him . " " Right . " She smiled . " Thanks for trying . Want to play again ? " " You asked . I 'm serious . " " Are you ? That 's one of the silliest stories I ever heard . " " It 's true . And I really could use your help . " He thought a moment , then let out a sudden burst of laughter . " I just realized-this is The Search for Strock ! " " " Huh ? " " We 're even eating in an Italian restaurant , me and the native . Oh , no , wait , that was the next movie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a pun . You know , on The Search for Spock ? " " Spock ? You mean Dr. Benjamin Spock , the pediatrician ? " " No , I mean Spock , Kirk 's first officer . " " Huh ? " " On TV . Have n't you ever seen Star Trek ? " Paula shrugged . " Never heard of it . " Another divergence between universes . Jack really had to stop making these assumptions . But wait a minute " Paula , I just mentioned a TV show to you that apparently does n't exist here . Now do you believe me ? " She ate a little more food before answering . " You could be making that stuff up , just to make your story more believable . I 'm sorry , but you 're going to have to come up with something better than that . " Suddenly , Jack felt the same wave of dizziness he had felt that morning . He doubled over , his arms gripping his body tight . Jack ? Jack ! What 's happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in quiet darkness for an indeterminate time . Suddenly , he was back in the restaurant , sitting across from Paula . He felt weak . " Jack ! Are you OK ? You-you flickered out for a moment there . " He nodded and looked around . A few of the other diners were staring in his direction . " We 'd better get out of here , " he whispered . " You got that right . " Paula left money for their dinners and helped Jack to his feet . As they headed towards the exit , she said , " Oh , Jack . " " Hm ? " " I think I believe you now . " Paula lived in a small apartment in an old Victorian house that had been split up into individual units . It was a third floor walkup , but Jack felt well enough by the time they got there to climb the stairs without help . Paula opened the door and turned on the lights , revealing a living room a little more cluttered than Jack 's own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him towards a blue sofa . " I have to go to the bathroom . Be back in a minute . " Jack chose to wander around the room instead . Whenever he visited a friend , he always felt drawn to see what books were on the shelves , and the same urge existed even here . Paula kept her bookcase next to her television set , and Jack noticed that videotapes and CDs crammed for space among the books . Her tastes were eclectic . She had a lot of mathematics books , of course , but there were also quite a few popularizations of science , and a whole shelf devoted to comparative religion . No books on economics , though , which seemed odd , given Rachel 's interests back home . Paula 's fiction tastes also diverged from Rachel 's . Rachel liked romances ; Paula 's novels ranged from mysteries to fantasy , and Jack noticed a preponderance of titles by authors with the names of Ardai and Pierce . Idly , Jack wondered how many of these titles were unique to this universe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began paging through it . It did n't look like anything he remembered from back home , and he suppressed an impulse to steal the book . Paula emerged from the bathroom while Jack still had the book in his hand . She had changed into shorts and a Tshirt . " Can I get you anything ? " " No thanks , " he said , returning the book to the shelf . " Interesting collection you have here . " " Thanks . " She walked over to the TV and turned it on , but kept the sound low . " News , " she said , as she sat down on one end of the sofa . She grabbed a pillow and pulled her legs up . " I hope you do n't mind . " " Not at all . " Jack said . He settled himself comfortably onto the other side of the sofa . They remained silent for a few seconds . The flickering of the television screen and its low droning dominated the room . Finally , Paula spoke . " So . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good . Now , Jack . You must have extreme loyalty towards your friend to come to another universe to find him ! " He chuckled . " I guess so . " " Want to tell me the full story ? I think I 'm ready for it now . " Jack nodded , and in a few minutes , it seemed , he had told her his whole life story . When he finished , she wrung her hands for a few seconds and stared at the television . Then she turned back to look at him . " Do n't you realize how illogical this is ? " Jack squirmed . " Well , sort of . " She rolled her eyes . " Sort of , " the man says . Jack , I 'm sure you 've thought of this already , but I think you need to hear this again . Brace yourself . " If Daniel Strock does exist in this universe , he 's not your Daniel Shock . " Jack looked away from her . " I knew that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? Introduce yourself as the long-lost best friend he never had ? " " Well , I- " " And have you considered the possibility that he does n't exist here at all ? " " What are you talking about ? " " You yourself said that there were different scientists working at the two different laboratories . How do you know that a version of your friend exists here ? " Jack shouted . " He must exist here ! You exist here ! " " So ? " " Listen , Rachel- " " Rachel ? " He felt his face flush . " I mean , Paula . " She raised an eyebrow . " Who the hell is Rachel ? " " Rachel is-was-I mean-Rachel 's an old girlfriend of mine . Married now . " Jack swallowed . Paula sat silent for a moment . Then she jumped up and threw the pillow at him , hard . " Was this a ploy- " she yelled . " No ! " Jack replied . " I swear ! I did n't even know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I would 've brought a picture of you , not Daniel ! " That seemed to calm her down . She sat down again , but faced away from Jack and towards the television . Suddenly she seemed surprised . She leaned forward , grabbed the remote control , and turned up the volume . Jack looked towards the television . There was a picture of him to the upper right of the news anchor . The anchor was saying , " - still looking for Jack Levinson , who trespassed onto the SSC facility today . Levinson should be considered dangerous , and if you see him , do not approach him yourself . Instead , police are requesting that anyone with information call them at the number on your screen . " The anchor went on to another story , and Paula muted the sound . " You 're hot , are n't you ? " she asked softly . Jack nodded . " It 's what I told you . Dr. Zahn said that they could n't send too much mass through the Gate , or else- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world turned dark and quiet . When the world came back , Jack saw Paula running around the room frantically . " Are you all right ? " she asked him after she spotted him . She sat down next to him and put her hands on his shoulders . Jack nodded ; this time , he felt weak and his throat felt dry . " I could use some water , " he croaked . Paula nodded and brought him a glass from the kitchen , which he drained eagerly . " What happened ? " he asked . " You were gone for a full minute . For a moment there , I thought- " She stopped . " Yes ? " " Nothing . I 'm glad you 're OK . " " Thanks . " Paula sat down again . " All right , Jack . Look at this optimistically . Let 's suppose Daniel did exist here and was willing to be your friend . How were you going to stay in touch ? What were you planning to do ? Live here indefinitely ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . I guess I had n't given it much thought . " She laughed ; her eyes sparkled . " Ai n't that the truth . " After a moment , her face took on a more somber expression . " You know what you have to do , Jack . " She tilted her head towards the television , reminding Jack of the news report . " Tomorrow , you have to call the lab and tell them where you are . Otherwise . . . " He nodded . " Otherwise , I might disappear completely . " " Yeah . And-and I would n't want that to happen . " They were silent for a moment , then Jack said , " Let 's talk about something else . " " OK . " They talked about books , about childhood , about current events . They delighted in both the similarities and the differences between their two universes . The night grew longer , and they found themselves moving closer together on the sofa . Finally , Jack 's arm went over Paula 's shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first warmly , like close friends , then passionately , like lovers . Jack felt the warm sensuousness of her body next to his , and knew he wanted her and that his desire was reciprocated . But . . . but he also knew it would n't be right , as he was sure she realized as well . They broke off the kiss and gazed at each other for a few seconds , although it seemed like much longer . Then he spoke . " I 'll sleep out here . " She hesitated , then nodded . " I 'll get you a blanket . " She opened a closet , pulled one out , and handed it over to Jack . " Thanks , " he said , taking the blanket . " Good night . " " Night . " Paula closed the door to her bedroom , and Jack lay down on the sofa . It took him a long time to get to sleep . The next morning , Jack woke to the sound of Paula on the telephone . " Hello ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to come to work today . Could you ask Maxine to make sure my classes are covered ? I 've left emergency lesson plans in the top drawer of my desk . Thanks . " Jack groaned , and Paula turned to him . " Good morning . " " Ugh . " He sat up , rubbed his eyes . " What time is it ? " " Seven . I had to call in sick . " " Seven , " Jack echoed . " You know , the one thing I could never get used to in our profession is the early hours . " " Oh , you ought to be used to it by now . " She headed towards the kitchen . " Want breakfast ? " " Sure . Just let me get ready . " " Fine . I 've left a fresh razor on the bathroom sink for you . You probably want to shave . " Jack got up and headed to the bathroom to take a shower . Half an hour later , dressed in the same clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her kitchen table . She was eating cereal and scrambled eggs , and reading a newspaper . " Good morning . " " Good morning . " She took a sip of coffee . " Feeling more human ? " " Yeah , I think so . " " Good . Help yourself to some food . There are eggs on the stove . " Jack filled a plate with eggs and a bowl with cereal , but demurred at the coffee , as he never drank the stuff . He poured himself some orange juice instead , sat down , and asked , " Can I have the comics ? " " Hm . " Paula turned a page . " You 'd probably rather take a look at this . " She handed him the main section of the paper , folded over to an article titled , POLICE SEARCH FOR SSC TRESPASSER . " The same picture of Jack from last night 's news broadcast accompanied the article . Jack handed it back . " I doubt there 's anything new from last night . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Anderson , I think her name was . It sounds like she 's the one you 're going to have to call . " " Anderson . . . yeah , I remember her . She was present when the universes merged . " He started to scan the article . " What 's it say she does ? " " It calls her a project leader , but does n't say which project . " Jack swallowed some eggs . " Given the lid your side is keeping on the existence of my universe , she 's probably the one in charge of the Gate on this end . " Paula nodded and sipped some more coffee . " So what 's the plan ? " " The plan is- " Again , Jack felt dizzy and his world disappeared . When it reappeared , Paula 's place at the table had been cleaned up . She sat there , her face obscured by her newspaper . " How long ? " Jack asked , feeling weak and parched . He reached for a glass of orange juice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her watch . " Forty minutes . " " You seem awfully casual about this . " She shrugged . " What could I have done ? I figured if you did n't reappear all day , I 'd call the lab . About the only other thing I did was make sure not to sit in your chair They both smiled at that , and then Paula added , " But I was worried , in case you were wondering . " Jack finished eating while the two of them engaged in idle chatter . After he was done , Paula cleared his plates , sat down again , and said , " So . " " So . " " Do you want to call them now ? " Jack nodded . " But not from here . If they 've been keeping the Gate a secret , I do n't want them to be able to trace you to me . You might get in trouble . " Paula laughed . " Oh , so the big man is going to protect me from danger ! Save me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being serious . " " So was I. Jack , I want to help you with this . But I ca n't if you do n't let them know about me . Otherwise , there 's no way they 'd let me in to communicate with you . And if I 'm going to search for Daniel for you He interrupted her . " But I thought- " Then he stopped . " You thought what ? " Jack felt uncomfortable , and he shifted in his seat . " Well , from what you said last night , I thought you did n't think I should bother looking for Daniel anymore . I did n't realize you were volunteering to help me find him .. " So what did you think I wanted you to call the lab for ? " " Um , well , after you pointed out that I may not be able to stay here indefinitely , I was going to see if they had a way ofof stabilizing me , so I would n't keep disappearing , and so I could keep looking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really do n't think that 's the way to go about it . But if that 's how you want to play the game , we 'll play it your way . " Paula drove them to a pay phone a few blocks away , and waited in the airconditioned cab of her truck while Jack stood in the heat and light of the late morning . He dialed the lab and asked to be connected with Dr. Anderson . " Who is this , please ? " the voice on the other end asked . Jack paused , then gave his name . There was an immediate click , and Dr. Anderson came on the line . Jack recognized her voice from two years ago . " Mr. Levinson ! Thank God ! Where are you ? " Jack did n't want to be rude , but the phone call had to be on his terms . " Never mind that , " he said . " We need to talk . " " Mr. Levinson , you need to get back over here right away . We- " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was a pause . " You do n't understand . You passed through the Gate at a crucial time of operation . Ever since you jumped over , the Gate has been going haywire . We 've been trying to restabilize it , but it does n't want to cooperate . If you do n't come back , we may lose it entirely . " " Dr. Anderson , quite honestly , I do n't care about the problems you 're having with your experiment . I 've been having problems of my own . " " I can imagine . Listen to me . You do n't belong in this universe . If the two universes get separated , your home universe is going to try to drag you back into it . But without a working Gate , we do n't know where you 'll be dragged to . Probably some nonexistent in-between . " Jack swallowed hard . " I think I 've already experienced it . And that 's my problem . I need to stay here in your universe for a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's not possible . " " Oh , come on ! You must have some way to allow me to stay here for an extended period of time . Maybe we can cut a deal . " " A deal ? Mr. Levinson , you ca n't cut a deal with the laws of physics . It 's not safe for you to stay here , and we do n't know how to make it safe . " " Look , I know people have gone through before- " " What ? Who told you that ? " Dr. Anderson sounded stunned . " Um , one of the technicians on the other side . He said that he 'd been through many times . " Dr. Anderson laughed , a frank laugh that bore no traces of deception . " He was kidding you . The Gate is dangerous , Mr. Levinson . We would n't let people go through casually . In fact , you 're the first . The only things we pass through the Gate on a regular basis are radio waves . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to set off another explosion . " There was a pause . *I never got a chance to tell you how sorry I was , about your friend . " Suddenly Jack realized that Anderson felt real guilt over Daniel 's death . Not just guilt , but responsibility as well . It had been her collider , after all , which had leaked its antimatter beams into his universe . " Thank you , " he said . Jack , listen , " she said , using his first name for the first time . " We 're just beginning to understand the Gate . If you come back and go home , we may be able to figure out how to allow safe passage for an extended period of time . But if you insist on staying here , you risk hurting not just the experiment , but yourself and the two universes as well . Please come back . I promise that no harm will come to you , and youll be able to pass freely back into Universe Two . " " I 'll call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone . They drove back to Paula 's apartment in silence , as Jack wanted time to assin ilate the conversation . Once they were seated upon the sofa , Jack summarized the phone call for Paula . " You 're going to have to go back , " Paula said when he was finished . bI guess so . " " You guess so ? Jack , if you do n't go back , you 'll eventually disappear for good . " " Yeah , I know . But it still feels wrong . " " It 's not that bad , Jack . " " Yes , it is . I-I really needed to find Daniel . " " Why ? " Paula said sharply . " Huh ? " " Why ? " I asked . Why was it so important for you to find Daniel ? " " Because he 's my friend . I thought I explained that . " " Jack , there 's got to be more to it than that . People lose their friends all the time . But life goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , it does n't seem to have gone on for you either . " Jack winced , and Paula said , " Sorry . But it is true . Is n't it ? " Slowly , Jack began to nod . " It 's true . " He looked around the room for a moment , and let his gaze settle on the bookcase . " I-I feel old . I keep thinking I should still be a high school senior , or that I 've just graduated from college , when it 's really been over five years . I have this mental image of myself that I know intellectually is untrue , but I ca n't shake it . Every time I realize where I really am , how old I really am , I get scared . " " You 're too young for that . We both are . " " I ca n't help the way I feel . " Paula shook her head . " You know what your problem is ? You never faced death before . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . " Even as he said it , Jack realized how silly it sounded . " Do you really think that 's the same ? " She put her hand on Jack 's shoulder . " My father died when I was a senior in college . About seven years ago . " Jack turned back to look at her . " Oh . I 'm sorry . " " Thanks . And I have to admit , if I knew that he still might exist , somewhere , I might have gone looking for him , just like you did . But I did n't have that option . No one really does . So I got on with my life . " She paused momentarily , then continued . Jack , like the rest of us , you did n't want to deal with it , you did n't want to accept it . That 's OK . But unlike the rest of the world , you had a rather bizarre way of not dealing with it . You were able to hold onto a strange hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went looking for your friend in , God help us , another universe . " " But I did n't find him . " " But we still may . Look , I 'll take you to the lab . We 'll let them know I 'm searching for Daniel on your behalf . " " You 'll keep looking for him ? " She nodded . " I will . We 'll get those stuffy scientists to help out , or else I 'll threaten to tell someone . I 'm sure they 'll let us stay in touch , so I can keep you informed . " She smiled , and they stood up . They stared at each other for a moment , then embraced and kissed . After they had disengaged , Paula said , " Jack , from what you told me , Daniel was an impulsive , fun-loving person , right ? " " Yeah , he was . " " Well , he would have loved what you did these past few days . " Jack flashed a grin . " He would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And not just because , in your own way , you were trying to rescue him . But because of the way you did it . " il guess Daniel 's not that far away from me after all . " " No , he 's not . " " But , if you do ever find him " I 'll let you know . " As they headed out her apartment door , Jack said , " Do n't let me forget my bike , " and he smiled . She smiled back . " Do n't worry , I wo n't . " Jack returned to his home Universe that afternoon . Jack checked the address on the envelope against the number on the frame of the house as he wiped the sweat off his forehead . Summer in New York City was always the worst . He still found it difficult to believe that he was here , on 75th Road in Forest Hills , Queens , but that 's what the street signs said . The house seemed to be the correct one . He climbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door opened , and there was Rachel , holding a baby in the crook of her left arm . She looked puzzled for a moment , then her face lit up . " Oh my God ! Jack ! Is it really you ? " Jack nodded . " Yes , it 's me . " " It 's great to see you ! Come in , come in ! " Jack entered the house and looked around . The door opened onto a living room , in which sat a large piano , a sofa , and a desk . On either side of the desk were bookshelves , set into the walls , and Jack spotted their old high school yearbook sitting on one of the shelves . " Why did n't you call me to tell me you 'd be coming to visit ? What 's up with your life ? What 's going on ? " Jack looked around , and he felt the picture of Daniel in his pocket .
