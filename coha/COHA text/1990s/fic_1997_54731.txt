Since Mary Soon Lee 's first F &SF; story appeared in our May , 1995 issue , she has published several other stories in magazines Interzone to On Spec . She has also sold us several more stories , of which " Universal Grammar " is the first . <p> She writes , " I often find it hard to identify where the ideas for my stories come from , but in this case I can pinpoint at least one source . After years of meaning to read Noam Chomsky 's book , Language and Problems of Knowledge , I finally did so , and found it fascinating . The first draft of ' Universal Grammar ' was completed one day after I finished Chomsky 's book . " <p> The influences are clear , but the story takes us into a world all its own . <p> As soon as I saw the pictures of the latest aliens sliming inside their tank , I knew two things . One : I did n't want to go anywhere near those creatures . Two : the department would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pub 's news-cube and swallowed the rest of my vodka in a burning gulp . The aliens reminded me of the octopus I 'd run into one day at the seaside . At six years old , I 'd taken a good look at the octopus with its corpse-white suckers opening and closing like a hundred blind mouths , and then I had run screaming up to the hotel . <p> Well , that was a long time ago . I 'm thirty-three now and I have an image to maintain : Janna Suzorsky , woman of the world , undaunted by anything or anyone that comes my way , aliens included . But the hair was standing up on the back of my arms , and I had to struggle to maintain a calm expression . <p> The first alien visitors arrived in 2039 . I was finishing my doctorate , certain that the aliens would have more sense than my own people , desperate to meet them . But the aliens did n't come to the USA , let alone Harvard . Instead they announced in flawless Parisian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tower . A day later , they were gone and we had n't learned one word of their language . <p> Since then , Earth has had interstellar visitors an average of once every two years , the octopus creatures were our eighth alien species . The others arrived speaking perfect Spanish , or Swahili , or Texas drawl . The closest anyone got to learning their own languages was when I deduced some simple word elements from the gestural vocabulary of the Eridanians . As soon as the Eridanians realized I 'd understood some of their remarks , they stopped gesturing and talked to one another in Mandarin Chinese . When it came right down to it , none of the aliens had given us any more than a field day for the media and a huge boost to military budgets . Not one new antibiotic , or metal alloy , or even a glimpse of the interior of their spaceships . <p> In the background I heard the newscaster getting more and more excited . So far the octopus aliens had n't said a word in any human language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't understand us . Maybe they 'd be willing to teach us their language as we taught them ours . Maybe . <p> My curiosity was beginning to conquer my dislike for all things slimy and tentacled . Catching Billy the bartender 's eye , I held up two fingers for another double shot of vodka . If the truth be known , I 've never much liked the flavor of alcohol , but my DNA chart shows no predisposition to alcoholism and liquor has its uses . By the time I was halfway through my second vodka , I was calm enough to swivel back toward the news-cube . <p> The seven aliens had docked at the Principia geosynchronous orbital station at 06:15 that morning . They 'd sent an unintelligible message on the UN military channel three weeks earlier , and the Security Council had been tracking their ship ever since . Not that the Council had deigned to tell the rest of us until the last possible moment . So there the aliens were , tentacles gesticulating wildly behind the smoky blue walls of their tank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what everyone hoped , myself included . I sat there at the bar , outwardly composed , but my heartbeat sang loud in my ears . I made myself watch the motions of the aliens , every ripple of their tentacles , the pattern in which their suckers opened and closed . Once the newscast switched away from the creatures to show Holman , my boss . Holman smiled his boyish grin , complete with a goddamn perfect dimple , as he murmured techno-speak for the cameras : language semantics , binding theory , the difficulties of inferring non-phonetic trace elements . <p> From the way the veins stood out on the backs of his hands , I could tell that Holman was stalling . He had no more idea what the aliens were saying than the cameramen did . But caught between the media-glare , the pressure from the military types , and his own ego , he had n't yet admitted to himself that he was stumped . <p> I estimated it would take him two more hours to realize that . And another hour to persuade himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , it must be humiliating to ask assistance from a junior member of the department . Especially when she 's publicly refused three dates and instead spends her time in some run-down pub in the East End of London . <p> I ran my finger along the counter , leaving a smeary track through the ringed imprints of glasses . This must once have been an exclusive establishment . The walls were wainscoted in English oak , the windows fitted with antique stained glass . But now the carpet was threadbare , the smell of cigarettes soaked decades-deep into the yellowed walls . There were only four customers , myself and three seedy characters playing poker at a corner table . <p> Billy the bartender muted the newscast and leaned on the counter opposite me . " Was n't that your boss on the news ? " <p> I nodded , scowling a little . Billy never quizzes me about my job and The Aliens , which is one of the reasons I keep coming to his pub . Unfortunately he does n't show the same restraint on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been given another honorary degree , " said Billy . <p> I nodded again . Billy stared at me expectantly , but I was n't going to help him with this particular conversation . Holman had milked every last drop of academic credit from our joint study of the Eridanian gestural vocabulary . To be fair , he 'd wanted to list me as senior author , but I declined . The bulk of the analysis was his . After the Eridanians switched to speaking Chinese my enthusiasm dwindled ; I continued to analyse the earlier tapes , trying to interpret more of their gestures , but it reminded me of studying Latin , or Sumerian , or any other dead language that no one but academics will ever speak . <p> I gazed at the muted news-cube . Two of the octopus creatures brushed tentacles with each other , a slow , languid touch . I waited for the camera to pull back and show the others : how did they react ? Was touching commonplace or significant ? But the camera cut to the vacuous smirk of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long was Holman going to take before he called me ? The man had a knack for being perfectly infuriating without doing anything I could actually object to . The day before , at the end of a department meeting , he had asked us all to join him for some relaxation . His dimpled smile had been Innocence itself . But I knew that he knew the others were busy , and I was n't about to agree to an evening alone for two . <p> I had declined his offer with chilly politeness , and only then had Holman played his trump card . " A pity , " he said , his rich deep voice drawing out each syllable , " I had tickets for the opening performance of Pride and Prejudice . " <p> I 'd been trying to get tickets for the premiere for weeks . If it had been anyone else I 'd have asked to accept the invitation after all . But I could see from Holman 's smirk that he was waiting for me to do exactly that . <p> As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd planned this too : picked a weekend when I 'd made it clear I was otherwise engaged , and then arranged for the most intriguing alien contact to date . All right , so that was going too far , but why had n't the man phoned me by now ? <p> I badly needed a distraction . I stood up and crossed over to the poker game . <p> Big Al grinned at me . " You look like you got some cash burning holes in your pockets . " <p> " Maybe . " I took a seat on Lara 's right , laid a fold of bills down on the worn green felt . <p> Lara riffle-shuffled the cards , and pushed them to me to cut , the light reflecting from her long red fingernails . Beside Lara , I feel like a flat-chested teenager . At nights , when the pub fills up , she plays the role of a licensed hooker who 's relaxing on her night off . I do n't know what her real job is , but I 'd guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I pushed the deck back to Lara . " What 's the game. ? " <p> Flicking her blonde ponytail over her shoulder , Lara dealt the cards out , keeping them low to the table . " Five card stud , nothing wild . " <p> We played stud poker and draw poker , brag and blackjack . The pile of money in front of me swelled and dwindled and grew again . After four hours , I was ahead by a few dollars and Big Al was up considerably more . Lara looked resigned and Marcos looked gloomy . <p> And Holman had n't called . <p> When I could n't keep my mind on the game , I stood up and gave my place to a man I did n't recognize . I did n't want to go back to my apartment , and I was in no mood for hitting the town . So I went upstairs to the login booths . My usual booth was free . I slipped in my credit chip and shut the door behind me . <p> Billy has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are soundproof and the datalinks are secure . I linked in to the department 's system and called up the files on the octopus aliens . They leapt into view on the cube : seven sets of tentacles waving in front of me with crystal clarity . I shifted further back in my chair . <p> My security clearance gave me access to most of the files . Twenty-three minutes after the alien ship had docked at Principia , their airlock cycled open and the aliens came out in their tank . The airlock had cycled open once every 2.8 hours since then . Each time it stayed open exactly 29.3 seconds , but nothing had come out except that first tank . The tank itself was a sealed prism about four meters long by two meters tall , ignoring the nominal floor and ceiling marked out in Principia 's microgravity environment , the tank glided along the walls before settling in a doorway . <p> The military were sticking to their usual hands-off policy ; no invasive scans of the aliens , nor of their ship , nor of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the alien species had yet attacked us , but it left us with very few hard facts . <p> The physicists could n't determine whether the ship possessed a faster than light drive , nor what weaponry it had , if any . The biologists had detailed the apparent similarities and differences between the aliens and Earth marine creatures , but most of their report was speculation . The aliens floated behind those smoky blue walls , apparently silent , though the biologists would n't rule out the possibility of a vocal component stopped by the tank 's wall . <p> Twice in the last five hours the tank had spontaneously glided along the walls of Principia to a new resting place . The engineers had n't figured out how the aliens controlled those movements ; there were no obvious links from the tank 's interior to any steering system . Maybe the tank responded to the creatures ' movements . <p> I flicked past the reports and replayed the videos of the aliens themselves . It did n't take long before I had a full scale headache . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be communicating by the position of their tentacles , or the changing rhythms in which their maggot-gray suckers opened and closed , or by the undulating shape of one particular sucker , or by scent-coded messages sprayed into the water . <p> I programmed the computer to try to find correlations between the creatures ' behavior and the stimuli being provided by Holman and the others . Holman showed the aliens elementary mathematical sequences , diagrams of the periodic table , star charts , geometrical shapes , pictures of Earth fauna and flora . <p> Occasionally the aliens appeared to be watching him , but I could n't pick out any clear response . Surely they must have at least understood numerical sequences such as prime numbers : why did n't they reply ? Because we insulted them by choosing something so basic ? Because Holman himself had somehow offended them ? Or maybe they had signaled an answer , and we were too obtuse to decipher it . <p> A priori , we have no reason to assume that an alien language will be intelligible to us . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other linguists began to deduce the human language faculty . Contrary to earlier assumptions , human infants do n't learn language from first principles . Instead part of their brain is already geared up to decrypt human-style language . On a deep structural level , Chinese and Bengali and Latin all follow the same underlying rules for handling nouns and verbs , for using trace elements and binding anaphora . This complex system is available to us subconsciously from our innate language faculty . Infants must learn the particular vocabulary and local rules from their environment , but the deeper rules of how to process language are already in place . <p> An alien language , however , would be expected to have a different structure , one which our brains are n't adapted to process . So , unlike a human language , we would never be able to master the alien tongue to the point where our understanding of it happened immediately and subconsciously . Nonetheless , with the aid of computers and logical inference - and some cooperative aliens  --  we might be able to deduce the rules of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same mechanical way that we can decode a mathematically encrypted message . <p> The previous sets of aliens , the ones who spoke our languages perfectly , had presumably first studied our TV and radio broadcasts . Having deduced the rules of our languages , they could have coded them onto some kind of translator implant to use when speaking to us . <p> That was the theory anyhow . Yet as I sat in the booth , trying to spot meaningful patterns and symmetries in the aliens ' behavior , I did n't make any progress at all . I was n't even sure which movements were genuine language signals and which were random noise . <p> When it got to nine in the evening , I went down to the bar and grabbed a chicken sandwich and three aspirin . Billy nodded at the news-cube as the camera zoomed in on Holman 's face . Holman 's grin looked a little more strained , and there were faint shadows under his eyes , but the bastard still had n't phoned me . <p> " According to Reuters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold a regular job , let alone to really work at it . " <p> Sometimes Billy sounds like a pensioner harping on the good old days , though he ca n't be more than forty-five . " Holman enjoys his work , " I mumbled , my mouth half-full of sandwich . " And he especially enjoys all the attention that comes from it . " <p> " Maybe , maybe not , but once he figures out what those octopus things are saying , he 'll have more attention than he knows what to do with . " <p> " If he figures out what they 're saying . " <p> Billy smiled . " I bet he 's halfway there already . " <p> I would have made a skeptical remark , but Billy had moved on to another customer . I chewed the rest of my sandwich automatically , my appetite gone . Waiting for Holman to finally ask me for help was bad enough . Thinking that he might solve this without me brought back my headache . <p> I stalked upstairs to the booth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full minutes before he deigned to wander over to a privacy hood and speak to me . When his face finally appeared in the cube , I realized I had n't planned what to say . Deciding on the casual approach , I said , " How 's it going ? " <p> " Janna , I 'm busy . Is there something you need ? " " Not at all . I thought you might want some assistance ; I could catch the next clipper up to Principia  --  " <p> Holman shook his head . " This area of the station 's been secured . I 've been asked to keep my staff down to a minimum . Besides , you made it obvious enough that you were busy this weekend . So , if there 's nothing wrong at your end ? " His deep voice rose slightly in question . Holman has the most expressive voice I know . If it were n't for the way we end up yelling at each other , I could listen to him for hours . <p> " No , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He closed the connection . <p> I glared at the CALL TERMINATED sign flashing in the center of the cube . There were probably two dozen scientists , a squad of UN soldiers , three camera crews , and twenty politicians all up there with the aliens . Yet Holman had all but ordered me to stay away . <p> Well , fine then . I called up the files on the aliens again . Painstakingly , I repeated my analysis , this time searching with the computer for paired movements that might combine to form a single word element . <p> Somehow I was approaching this incorrectly . That had been the problem with the Eridanians . We 'd been so busy speculating about the high-pitched clicks they periodically made that we ignored their gestures . Now the biologists conjectured that the clicks had been a mere animal process , say like our stomachs rumbling when we 're hungry . <p> I glanced at the clock : 11:15 P.M .. Two more hours had disappeared . My animal body was getting tired . A purple cue-button popped up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycled open again , right on time , but nothing came out . I rubbed at my temples : okay , the airlock opened every 2.8 hours . Why ? If not to let something out , then maybe they were waiting for us to put something there . Such as what ? Human visitors in exchange for the aliens touring Principia ? Only the aliens did n't seem that interested in Principia . The tank moved , but the aliens barely paid attention to their surroundings . <p> That was it . I leaned forward , my fingers trembling , and quickly ran a search through the few stimuli the aliens seemed to pay attention to : bright colors , rapid movements of large objects . <p> I called up Holman . <p> He answered almost at once , his face snapping into view in the middle of the cube . Stubble dotted the clean lines of his chin . " Janna . " Tiredness seeped into his voice , deepening it further . " I 'm sorry ; I intended to call you back . Have you had time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're trying to talk to the wrong aliens . The octopuses are just animals  --  maybe presented to us as some kind of test , or ritual exchange , or  --  " <p> " Perhaps you 'd better begin at the beginning . " <p> I took a deep breath . " Okay . It only occurred to me a few minutes ago , but I 'm pretty certain that the octopuses are n't intelligent . Try running a series of stimulus response tests on them , and I 'll give you three to one odds they 'll only react to simple visual cues . They have n't responded to complex signals such as prime numbers , because they do n't understand them any more than a chimpanzee does . " <p> " One second . " Frowning , Holman turned away from the phone pickup . I heard the faint echo of his voice speaking to someone out of my sight . He disappeared for a minute , and then his face swung back in place . He gave me his best dimpled grin . " It appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjectures you wish to share ? " <p> " Not really , only that if there are any sentient aliens still inside the ship , they might be sitting there waiting for us to give them something in exchange for the octopuses . " <p> " Which is why their airlock cycles open periodically ? Possibly . " Holman turned away again and swung back a moment later . " Can you be at the Cape in three hours ? There 's a military shuttle taking off for Principia . " <p> " I 'll be there . " <p> Holman met me when I stepped out of the shuttle and onto Principia geosynchronous orbital station . I 'd been to the Lunar colonies several times and once to a low Earth orbit station , but I 'd never before boosted on a military shuttle . My legs were jelly . If I had n't already lost my dinner on the short flight , I 'd have lost it over Holman . <p> " Rough trip ? " said Holman , grinning . <p> I wanted to kick him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time my foot was aimed to kick , Holman was partway down the corridor . <p> " Hurry up . You were right about the octopuses being non-sentient . " <p> Cautiously , I pushed my magnetic boots away from the broad metal ribbon of the beginners ' pathway , and propelled myself along after Holman . <p> He waited impatiently for me to catch up . " We 're not sure yet whether the octopuses were meant as a gift , or a test , or a trade . We put a tank of fish into the airlock last time it cycled open , together with a sheet of mathematical sequences and a map of the solar system . " <p> " Any response ? " <p> " Not yet . But if they keep to their previous schedule , the airlock will open again in nine minutes . " <p> Holman hurried us past the military checkpoints , slowing only as we approached the secondary docking area . The curved windows showed a mass of jewel-bright stars , their blue and red and yellow shades a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung the cylindrical structure of the alien ship , bathed in the station 's floodlights . Odd protrusions prickled from every surface of the main cylinder  --  thin metallic rods , cobwebs of rust-colored strands , rounded bumps . From one end a short tube flexed across to the station 's docking port . It was the ugliest , strangest , most fascinating object I 'd ever seen . <p> Holman caught me by the arm and stopped me by a line on the floor . A group of other people clustered behind the line . Off to one side stood five soldiers , their spines ramrod straight . At least their guns were holstered . <p> With a faint sigh , the airlock door opened . Two tall figures stepped forward , their bodies hidden in pale orange spacesuits . But I could make out their heads through the smoky blue of their face plates . Three insectile compound eyes stared back at us from each face , the eyes spaced evenly around a mobile white orifice  --  mouth , or nose , or something else . <p> A lump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the alien held out a sheet covered in jagged symbols . A tinny sound resonated in the air , like rain dancing on a metal roof . <p> Holman 's hand pushed me forward , and then I was standing a meter in front of the alien , tilting my head to stare at its face . <p> " Hello . " I took the sheet of symbols from the alien , the texture rougher than paper between my fingers . The alien 's eyes glinted at me . For a moment my throat was too full to speak . " Thank you , thank you very much . We 're very happy to welcome you to Earth . " <p> The alien said something in that patter of tinny sounds . It subsided downwards , the suit belling outward , and crouched on the magnetic strip in the floor . The other alien crouched down beside it . <p> Alien number two laid down a metal tray , and pushed a round blue disk into the center of the tray . " Tt-si , " it said . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I squatted down on the floor and pointed first at one disk then the other , my fingers shaking . " One . Two . " <p> " You realize , " said Holman dryly as he settled down beside me , " that they might be saying ' round , ' ' blue , ' ' metal , ' or just ' hello . ' If those are even words at all . " <p> " Pessimist , " I muttered . <p> Alien number one 's spacesuit bulged , and it deposited a third blue disk . " Tt-miyt . ... Tt-si , tt-siyt , tt-miyt . " <p> " Three , " said Holman . " One , two , three . " <p> The muscles round my mouth felt strange . It was only when I glanced over to Holman and saw his broad grin that I realized I was beaming like a baby . <p> That first day we covered some rudimentary vocabulary , numbers , mathematical terms , the names of chemical elements . And each other 's names . The aliens were , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's a lot of extra detail carried at frequencies just above the human auditory range . Tmisi was the more talkative of the pair and fidgeted more . <p> On the second day , we progressed to simple sentences  --  " A Tsiliit has three eyes ; a human has two eyes "  --  enough to realize that the underlying structure of the language the aliens were teaching us was very similar to our own . <p> On day three , several terrestrial academics announced that they had suspected such language similarities for years . Just as there is a single theory that captures the essential properties of arithmetic , the academics claimed that the human language faculty captures the most economical way to structure complex thoughts , from the hierarchical use of nested clauses to the splitting of words into noun-verb categories . <p> The next day , having cleared it with the military , Holman brought out tapes of our earlier alien visitors . Sirit took one look as we played the first tape , then folded its head down against its body , eyes hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset you ? " Holman switched off the tape , but Sirit stayed tucked over against itself and did n't answer . <p> Tmisi shrilled the Tsiliit for " I do n't understand " followed by a rapid patter of words I did n't recognize . <p> I stared at Sirit and all I could think was that we 'd hurt it somehow . And suddenly the Tsiliit I 'd learned seemed useless , touching on nothing that I needed . I knew how to say " The Earth is the third planet orbiting our sun , " but I could n't say " I 'm sorry . " <p> I stretched out my hand and brushed the side of its spacesuit , the way I 'd seen Sirit and Tmisi brash each other . " I 'm sorry , " I said in English , and then asked in Tsiliit , " Did seeing the tapes of the aliens cause body-injury to Sirit ? " <p> " No . " Sirit raised its head fractionally . " The tapes made me lisiiyr "  --  a word I did n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not give anything . " <p> Sirit straightened up . In its tinny accent , it said , " It causes me much ttsiys to talk to you . " <p> " And we are very happy to talk to you . " My voice was husky . For some reason I did n't shrug Holman away when he put his hand on my shoulder and squeezed it gently . <p> Late on day six , I discovered that Tmisi and Sirit were both addicted to games . We showed them chess , and backgammon , and Parcheesi . In return , they taught me a game with an unpronounceable name , played with a bundle of short rods that change color when you touch them to each other . The rules of the game vary each time , the two opponents taking it in turns to invent fresh constraints . <p> The first time I beat Tmisi , it rocked back and forth , repeating , " You won , " in English and Tsiliit . It nudged each short rod in turn until they changed to a glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A gift to you . " <p> " Thank you . " I gripped the rods tightly as if it would help me hold onto that moment . <p> One morning in the second week , Tmisi produced eight tiny machines for our scientists to study . One of our scientists offered a book of airplane schematics , and tried to question Tmisi about the alien machines . Tmisi wriggled , and said that it did n't understand what caused the machines to function . Wriggling a little more , it added , " But I can show you how to use the animals we gave you . " <p> Holman looked up from his discussion with Sirit and stared at Tmisi . " The octopuses have a particular function ? " <p> " Yes , yes , " said Tmisi . It followed us to the room where the biologists were studying the octopuses . Much to the biologists ' excitement , three of the octopuses had laid foamy yellow clumps of eggs . Trying to look at anything except the octopuses , I gazed at one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tmisi 's spacesuit bulged and it took out a metallic rod . It pressed the tip against the wall of the tank . The rod glowed for a second , and then protruded into the tank 's interior . Tmisi delicately positioned the rod over an egg clump . A transparent sheet extended from the end of the rod , fastened over the eggs , and then Tmisi pulled the assembly out . Tmisi held out the bundle of eggs to Holman . <p> Holman accepted it gingerly . " How do I use these ? " <p> " Eat them . " <p> Holman nearly dropped the eggs . To his credit , he quickly wiped the look of disgust from his face . " Thank you . " <p> Tmisi added , " They will not cause you injury . Our computer analyzed the human tissue samples that you gave us . " <p> Holman lifted up an egg between his fingers and placed it in his mouth with grim determination . " Pretty good . " He turned to me with an evil smile . " Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have considered the diplomatic consequences of insulting a technologically superior species . Maybe I should have eaten the eggs out of common politeness . But it was the thought of Holman 's mocking me if I refused that finally decided me . I grabbed an egg , popped it into my mouth and swallowed immediately . <p> " Delicious , " I lied , and headed to the restroom to be discreetly sick . The egg did n't taste bad , just mildly salty , but the knowledge that it came from one of those octopus creatures was too much for my stomach . <p> On the twenty-third evening of their visit , the aliens left . They kept trying to explain why they had to leave , but that was one of the conversations we never managed to interpret . Holman thinks it may have been something to do with mating rituals ; I think Holman was just extrapolating from his own frustrations . <p> I stood near the docking port , my face pressed against the glass as the aliens prepared to leave . The tube to the airlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something coiled in my stomach , a hard lump . <p> " They 'll be back , " said Holman , " in six hundred and eleven Earth days . " <p> " I know . " I was hardly likely to have forgotten . Tmisi had told us so repeatedly . I tried to focus on that . Maybe they 'd even come to Earth to visit Billy 's pub , and I could teach them poker . There was no reason to feel sad , no reason at all . Three weeks ago , we lived in a universe where the only aliens we knew came and left without volunteering a single fact about themselves . Now I could speak an alien language , and I owned a strange game made of rods of changing colors . A gift from a friend . <p> The Tsiliit ship pulled away from the station . In one sharp motion it accelerated hugely , a dark blob racing across the field of stars . And then there was nothing .
