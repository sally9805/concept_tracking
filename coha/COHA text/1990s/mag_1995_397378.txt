TAXPAYERS HAVE GOOD REASON TO TOAST THE NEW YEAR . IN 1995 THEY will get more relief from state taxes than at any time in at least a decade . According to MONEY 's annual 50-state tax heaven/tax hell survey ( see page 92 ) , only Illinois and the District of Columbia seem highly likely to hike taxes , while more than half the states figure to seriously consider tax cuts . For example , newly elected or sitting governors strongly favor : * Phasing out state income taxes altogether in Arizona and Connecticut * Slashing state income tax rates by as much as 25% in Iowa , New York and Virginia * Shifting two-thirds of local education costs in Wisconsin from property taxes to the state . Such tantalizing tax treats are the payoff from the November elections , in which Republicans committed to trimming taxes won big across the country . The G.O.P. seized 11 governorships , putting the party in control of 30 statehouses , including those in eight of the nine most populous states . Republicans also gained a net of 481 state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of 7,424 . The backlash at the ballot box was fueled in part by more than a decade of steadily rising state and local taxes . Today 's median two-income married couple pay 12.4% of their income to state and local governments , up from 11.2% in 1980 , according to the Tax Foundation , an independent research organization in Washington , D.C. Keep a few of those celebratory bottles on ice , though . While foreseeing better times for taxpayers this year , tax experts say the years that follow may be far less buoyant . One reason is the economy . Over the past year , the states collected nearly 1% more in sales , income and corporate tax revenues than they had anticipated , thanks to strong growth driven in part by abnormally high consumer spending . That boost enabled 21 states to trim taxes some $2.7 billion , says Steven D. Gold , director of the Center for the Study of the States in Albany , N.Y . However , with inflation-adjusted incomes stagnant , the savings rate at a five-year low of 4% and consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income , most experts expect consumer spending to slow . Says Hal Hovey , editor of State Budget Tax News : " The excellent revenue performance of 1994 was stimulated by unusual high purchases of sales-taxed goods like cars , furniture and electronics . That will be extremely difficult to sustain past 1995 . " Another danger is that voters , no matter how much they want lower taxes , will insist that their public services not be reduced . In fact , the typical state has already approved plans to spend 7.5% more for prisons and 7.2% more for Medicaid in 1995 than last year , according to the National Conference of State Legislators . Since red-ink budgets are prohibited in all states but Vermont , higher spending could cause some major headaches . Warns Andrew Klutkowski , the legal editor at Research Institute of America , a tax analysis firm in New York City : " If states reduce taxes and hand the responsibility for services to local governments , cities and towns will have to respond by increasing property taxes . " Consider the example of New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1993 largely because she promised to slash state income tax rates by 30% in three years . She has already reduced them by 15% , but her administration balanced its 1994 budget partly by freezing state aid to schools and municipalities . As a consequence , according to the Associated Press , property tax levies across New Jersey rose 5% in 1994 , a full percentage point more than in any year since 1990 . " The sad reality is that cities and towns are at the end of the food chain , " says James McGreevey , a Democratic state senator who also serves as mayor of Woodbridge , N.J. In addition , states short of revenues are expected to quietly expand taxes on services . Over the past three years , many states have begun taxing everything from fur storage and lawn-care costs in Arkansas to janitorial services and exterminator bills in Ohio . " Manufactured items are a smaller and smaller proportion of the tax base , " says Sally Adams , an analyst at CCH Inc. , a provider of tax-law information based in Riverwoods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of items and activities captured by taxes . " Do n't let this cautionary outlook puncture your holiday spirit too quickly , though . Taxes are going down for now , and that 's good news . Read on for specific tips on how to keep your taxes low and your spirits high in 1995 and beyond : * Get to know your state 's tax code . The IRS estimates that near 8 million Americans overpaid their state and local tax bills in 1994 because they did n't realize they were eligible for special breaks . To learn about such goodies , curl up with the instruction booklet for your state tax return . The Hot Zone it 's not , but you 'll be the richer for spending time with it . If you 're retired and collecting Social Security benefits , for example , they wo n't be taxed  --  no matter how high your income  --  in Alabama , Arizona , Arkansas , California , Delaware , Georgia , Hawaii , Idaho , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , North Carolina , Ohio , Oklahoma , Oregon , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , Virginia and the District of Columbia . And at least part of a retiree 's pension is exempt from taxes in Alabama , Arkansas , Colorado , Delaware , Georgia , Hawaii , Illinois , Louisiana , Maryland , Michigan , Mississippi , Montana , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , North Carolina , Oregon , Pennsylvania , South Carolina and Utah . Couples can soften the marriage penalty by filing separate state tax returns  --  even if they file jointly at the federal level  --  in Alabama , Arizona , Arkansas , Delaware , Hawaii , Iowa , Kentucky , Mississippi , Montana , Pennsylvania , Tennessee , Virginia , West Virginia and the District of Columbia . In addition , if your children earn money , you might save by filing separately for them too . The federal government will tax investment income above $1,200 earned by any child under 14 at his or her parents ' rate . But all states with income taxes , except California and Hawaii , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much they earn  --  provided that separate federal and state returns are filed for them . * Be aware that some states , home is where your job is . If you own dwellings in two states and work part of the time in the state with the higher taxes , watch out . In recent years , California , New York and other high-tax states have begun taxing the entire income of such residents  --  even interest , dividends and capital gains earned in other states . What to do ? First , find out what constitutes taxable residency in each state where you work or own property . Says Stuart Kessler , a senior tax partner at the accounting firm Goldstein Golub Kessler &; Co. in New York City : " There is no hotter issue in the field of state and local taxation right now than establishing domicile . " Most states wo n't consider you a resident unless you spend more than half the year at a home within their borders . But New York and other particularly voracious states may try to tax your entire income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders  --  as long as there 's evidence that you were living in your primary home . What kind of proof can you offer to document that your home in the low-tax state is your main residence ? " Keep records that show where you spend most of your time , such as phone and electricity bills , " Kessler says . " Also , keep documents that show where you go to church , send your kids to school , register your car and vote . " * Shop around for sales tax breaks . Local surtaxes can cause sales taxes to vary widely from one community to another in some states . Californians , for example , pay 8.5% in sales taxes on purchases in San Francisco but only 7.25% in nearby San Rafael . Also , take advantage of sales tax reductions that your state may enact to promote business in depressed areas . For example , New Jersey slashes its 6% sales tax in half for shoppers in Newark . Another break : Car dealers in all states but California , Maryland and Michigan can subtract the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your new vehicle . * Cut down on consumption of unhealthy items . Over the years , states have regularly ratcheted up excise taxes on products regarded as unhealthy . For instance , in 1994 eight states raised cigarette taxes as much as 50c a pack , while six states hiked taxes on alcohol . Since these excise taxes  --  also known as " sin " taxes  --  are likely to go up again in 1995 , conserving your use of such products can lead to substantial savings . Last year , for example , a pack-a-day smoker in Michigan , home to the nation 's highest cigarette tax ( 75c a pack ) , could have saved $273.75 in taxes alone by kicking the habit . * Invest in tax-free securities . All states but Alaska , Florida , Nevada , South Dakota , Texas , Washington and Wyoming tax unearned income from investments . But interest on Treasuries and other securities issued by federal agencies is exempt from state and local taxes . Chip Norton , managing editor of the Bond Fund Advisor in Ashland , Mass. , recommends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Treasury ( call your local Federal Reserve bank or branch for an application ) . You might also consider municipal bonds , which pay interest that is generally exempt from federal taxes . ( For more information on munis , see the federal tax story on page 80 and the Orange County bankruptcy story on page 78. ) * Look for breaks on property taxes . If you own a home , all states except Connecticut , Indiana , Massachusetts , New Jersey , Pennsylvania and West Virginia will give you either a tax credit or a deduction on your state taxes for some or all of your property taxes . And you can exempt part of the value of your hose from taxation in Alabama , California , Florida , Georgia , Hawaii , Idaho , Illinois , Indiana , Louisiana , Massachusetts , New Mexico , Oklahoma , Texas and the District of Columbia . Also , a growing number of municipalities cut the property taxes of people age 65 and over , veterans , persons with physical disabilities and heads of low-income households . * Fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your local assessor 's appraisal of your house . For example , did he erroneously count your attic storage area as a bedroom ? Next , compare his estimate with recent sales prices of nearby homes that are similar to yours ; you can usually obtain the information from real estate agents or the assessor 's office . If you decide your property was overvalued , ask your local appeals board to correct the assessment . According to David Keating , vice president of the National Taxpayers Union in Washington , D.C. , only one in 150 homeowners appeal their assessments , but experts say about 50% of those who do win reductions . If you decide you need professional help , you can hire a consultant , who typically will charge half of your first year 's tax savings . One final tip : It may seem obvious , but this year more than ever , pay attention to the news . Part of the Republican message is that all taxes are on the table . So be on the lookout for any new breaks that might come your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local legislators . <p>
