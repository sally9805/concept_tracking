<p> Until late summer , the organizers of a Holocaust memorial here , the brainchild of Simon Wiesenthal , the Nazi hunter , were worried because everything was going so smoothly with the project that it seemed it might not elicit any comment . Now the project , which was to have been dedicated in November , is facing a shower of 11th-hour attacks and construction delays that will last until at least the spring . <p> In Austria , where the far-right Freedom Party gained widely in the Oct. 13 elections and where anti-Semitism is widespread , the surprise is that the most vocal opposition to the memorial has come from Jews who have myriad gripes . One prominent Jew here likened the feuding to an Isaac Bashevis Singer story . In the city 's small and heterogeneous Jewish population of roughly 12,000 , Mr. Wiesenthal , who lives here , is in particular a lightning rod . <p> The trouble has partly to do with whom the memorial is to serve : whether it is for Jews as a site of mourning , for non-Jewish Austrians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the question of who is to decide what form it should take . <p> " It is misunderstood as being a monument for Jews , " says Paul Grosz , president of the Jewish Community of Vienna , " but it is really about Jews , what happened to Jews . We Austrian Jews do n't need a monument to remind us what happened . We have daily reminders here . It 's the Austrians who need the monument , so it should n't have come from Wiesenthal . " <p> The memorial by Rachel Whiteread , the English artist , is a large , solid concrete abstraction that everyone is likening to an inside-out library , its exterior incised to resemble books on shelves , spines facing inward . About 12 feet high , 24 feet wide and 33 feet long , it will have the names of Austrian sites where Jews were killed during the war inscribed around its base . <p> Like other public sculptures , including Richard Serra 's ill-fated " Tilted Arc " in lower Manhattan , which was removed after being criticized as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own " House " in London , which was called an eyesore by neighbors and was debated in Parliament a few years ago , the memorial has raised hackles with some of the people who will be living and working near it . They have called it an ugly concrete bunker , gigantic and inscrutable . <p> But as Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof , a prominent liberal columnist for the weekly Profil who has written about the issue , pointed out in an interview , a Holocaust memorial in Vienna is not the same as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington , which commemorates a hero , or even the Vietnam Memorial , which is morally neutral . The monument here is about Austrian guilt , and perhaps should not be esthetically pleasing to Austrians . <p> " The memorial can not be beautiful , " Mr. Wiesenthal agreed . " It is about the Holocaust , so it should be like a shot in the heart . It is both a remembrance and an accusation . What does it represent ? Go to a Jew 's home , and you will find books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have related what the Nazis did through a sculpture of a figure , because the enormity of the idea of eradicating all Jews is not reducible to a single figure . " <p> Two years ago , Mr. Wiesenthal complained on local radio that no monument in Vienna refers to what Nazis did to Jews . In 1988 " The Monument Against War and Fascism , " designed by Alfred Hrdlicka , a Viennese artist , was dedicated in the city 's Albertinaplatz , but it does not mention Nazism . Part of the monument is a sculpture of an old Jew scrubbing the sidewalk , an allusion to the Jews whom Nazis forced to clean Vienna 's streets with rags and toothbrushes . Many Jews found the sculpture degrading , however , especially when passers-by began using it as a bench . <p> " Naturally , the work is anti-Jewish , " said Mr. Wiesenthal , who skirts the Albertinaplatz just to avoid it . The Mayor , Michael Haupl , heard Mr. Wiesenthal 's call for a new memorial and agreed that the city should sponsor one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the historic heart of Vienna . It is a picturesque and modest square where a medieval synagogue was burned in 1421 , along with the Jews inside it . A 500-year-old plaque in Latin hangs in the square commemorating the killing of " Hebrew dogs . " <p> Viennese officials invited nine artists and architects , Jews and non-Jews , to submit proposals , including the Russian artist Ilya Kabakov and the American architect Peter Eisenman . A jury , headed by Hans Hollein , the architect , and including Mr. Wiesenthal , picked Ms. Whiteread 's proposal in January . Save for a city councilman in the Freedom Party , Viennese officials all agreed to pay the roughly $500,000 that the project would cost . An exhibition of all the proposals was organized in the spring at the Vienna Kunsthalle by Gerald Matt , the Kunsthalle 's director . It met with polite notices even in the conservative press . <p> But trouble was brewing . First , opposition came during the summer from residents and shop owners on the Judenplatz , partly incited by the Freedom Party . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the square and that , considering anti-Semitism , it posed a security threat . They were joined by some Jewish proponents of excavations at the Judenplatz in conjunction with the memorial . The excavations had uncovered remains of the synagogue . <p> " The excavations are of the utmost importance for the Jewish community , its self-esteem and identity , " says Avshalom Hodik , a historian and executive director of the Vienna Jewish Community . " It shows the greatness of the medieval Jewish community here , that Jewish history is an integral part of the history of this country , with its own significance , and that Jews were not just victims of the Holocaust . " <p> Ms. Whiteread 's project , unlike some other proposals , did not incorporate the archeology , because she did not want implicitly to equate the enormity of the Holocaust with a medieval pogrom . But her sculpture did not preclude a separate underground display of the synagogue , either , and defenders of the memorial have expressed frustration that their opponents have managed to suggest otherwise . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more we found , the more that Jews became interested in the excavations , " recalls Ortolf Harl , the archeologist in charge . " Then opponents of the monument realized that they could use the archeology against the monument . " <p> The debate suddenly began to turn on how Jews wanted themselves to be represented : as victims of the Holocaust or as longstanding contributors to Viennese society . And responsibility for the memorial was becoming unclear : was it Mr. Wiesenthal 's project and a Jewish initiative ? Or was it , as Mr. Wiesenthal contended , a civic project of the Mayor 's , and something Austrians were doing for themselves ? <p> The first complaints seemed to stir people who had been reluctant to speak against the memorial before . Some Jews now said they felt patronized by the city , which had n't adequately consulted them . Others said the memorial 's metaphor of the people of the book reinforced a stereotype that Jews are valued only for their contributions to culture . Are n't the deaths of Jewish workers or doctors or bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others used the memorial as a cudgel against Mr. Wiesenthal . He is not popular among those Jews who think he did not adequately condemn Kurt Waldheim when Mr. Waldheim ran for president 10 years ago . Leon Zelman , head of the Jewish Welcome Service in Vienna , is one of them . " Why is Wiesenthal privileged to speak in my name ? " he asked about the monument . " I went to the Mayor and he told me that the Jews want it . I said : ' Who are the Jews ? Wiesenthal ? ' I 'm not against a monument . But make the excavation the monument so children can understand the background of the Holocaust and put the Whiteread someplace else . " <p> Ursula Pasterk , Mayor Haupl 's culture chief who helped to organize the memorial competition , said that it was still only a vocal minority of Jews who opposed the monument , and that to equate the burning of the synagogue with the Holocaust by making the excavation into the memorial would be " to minimize the crime of Nazism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Harl , the archeologist , expand his work , which has delayed Ms. Whiteread 's project . Having originally been hired to excavate 100 square meters of the square , he is now excavating 500 square meters , and the new proposal before the city council is to create a public exhibition area below ground with an entrance through a building on the Judenplatz that would become a museum . <p> The city still must approve the costs of the underground gallery and museum , and opponents of Ms. Whiteread 's project said they wre hoping that city officials , when they debate the new costs , would reconsider the memorial . <p> Mr. Zelman said he would push for discussion then but added : " Everything ultimately depends on what Grosz says . He is the only one who can speak for the Jewish community . " For his part , Mr. Grosz , the Jewish Community leader , said he was reluctant to support the Whiteread project on behalf of the city 's Jews . Asked whether he thought it would still be built , he answered : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think so is nearer the truth . " <p> Someone close to the project , who asked not to be identified , for fear of further inflaming the situation , said : " Can you do a Holocaust memorial in a city like Vienna if you are not sure that the Jews like it ? And how do you know that they do n't ? By referendum ? <p> " I think you do it because you do n't do it only for the Jews in Vienna today but for future generations of Jews and non-Jews . And you do it because Austria has an obligation to do it . "
