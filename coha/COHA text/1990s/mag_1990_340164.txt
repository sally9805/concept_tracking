The Indian Airlines Airbus A320 had been in service for only seven weeks when it began the approach for its scheduled landing in Bangalore after a 90-minute flight from Bombay . Moments before it was to touch down , in perfect flying weather , something went wrong . Falling short of the runway by 4,000 ft. , the plane crash-landed on a golf course . The toll : 90 dead and 55 injured . A sole passenger escaped unhurt . <P> The crash raised questions about the technology on the A320 , the world 's only civil airliner equipped with a fully computerized flight-control system . The critical problem may be the lack of matching electronic support systems on the ground in India , as well as in scores of other Third World countries . The government ordered an inquiry to establish the cause of the crash . But whatever its findings , there is little prospect of immediate improvement , even after last week 's disaster .
