<p> I WAS on a temp job in New York City when I saw the name " McCandless " on a door . That 's it , I thought . I 've found my name ! <p> I needed one because my actor 's union would n't let me use my own . They said somebody already had it , and they were firm about it : one person per name . It made sense ; you could n't have two Clint Eastwoods in the film business . But I thought it boded ill for my acting career . <p> So I looked for another one . It 's hard enough to pick children 's names , but to rename yourself is much harder , particularly when you do n't want to . A lot is riding on it . Do I pick something that rings with the truth of my being , or something that describes how I 'd like to be but do n't feel I actually am , yet ? If I had n't liked my name , I 'd have been glad to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to change both names , so I started hunting around for another last name . The pity was , I liked Foster , too . It means " to nurse or nurture . " It 's a name I do n't live up to enough , but I like having it , if only as a goal . Of course I did have to put up with fools cackling about me being a foster child . <p> And , being an actress , I had to be careful about the kind of name I chose . Something like Jessica Forsythe , say , would have gotten me relegated to soap-opera roles . Glamorous has a way of sounding pompous ; distinctive can turn into eccentric , subtle into forgettable . And it ca n't be too close to anyone else 's ( Meryl Stripe ? ) . <p> Then I found the door with McCandless on it and thought my troubles were over . It had a " Mc " ( I was enamoured with the Irish at the time ) , a " C " for alliteration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had decided was my motive for being an actress - to " enlighten . " I did n't just want to get out there and knock people 's socks off , I wanted to brighten their lives , shed light on their problems , be the light at the end of the tunnel . <p> So I got resumes printed with my new name , and new postcard-sized pictures , the ones actors send out saying , " I 'm playing Celia in ' The Importance of Being Earnest . ' Do come . " Or , " Did you get my resume ? " I learned to stand up when Catherine McCandless was called out at auditions . The only problem there was keeping from bursting into brogue . <p> I enjoyed McCandless at first , but after a few months it started to feel artificial . Face it , I 'm blonde , not red-haired ; English , not Irish . <p> When I 'd introduce myself at parties and acting classes as Catherine McCandless , a little voice would snip , " No , you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> SO , when my stepmother called up and asked if it was too late to change my name , I said no . <p> " What about your famous relative ? " she said . <p> " What famous relative ? " I perked up . This was the first I 'd ever heard of a famous relative . <p> " Gustave Dore . " <p> Silence . <p> " Who 's Gustave Dore ? " <p> Silence . <p> " The French book illustrator ? " said Anne , my stepmother . " Dante 's ' Inferno ' ? " <p> I went to the library and looked him up . Gustave was famous , in a small sort of way . He did n't apppear to have the most successful personal life , but he 'd done interesting work . This was a real family name . Carrie Dore Foster , my paternal grandmother , was related to him , so there was a bit more of a connection than a name off a door . And Dore was French for golden , which was close to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , I decided to change my name again . But my father , who worked for a newspaper , said no printer would print a name with an accent , so if I did n't want to end up being called Catherine Dore , I 'd better think of something . I came up with Doray . I felt bad about Americanizing it , but I had enough problems in this business without being called a door . <p> I got my name changed at all three unions : theater , television , and film . I got new resumes , new pictures , got used to introducing myself and answering to Catherine Doray , and got my friends to change their address books again . <p> So now I was French ! Sort of . Dore conjured up images of being romantic , stylish , quick , mercurial . I liked that better , but still felt a little earthbound and English . The little voice , at least , was n't calling me a " liar " in increasingly louder tones , but it was murmuring , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was not enough to catapult my career into the big time . I eventually left acting . I know , people always say you make money in your second 10 years and those who hang in there longer usually make it big . But after awhile " making it " seemed ever more elusive ; every time I moved up one rung of the ladder , the definition of making it moved up too . And I did n't see how always being number 495 on a sign-up sheet to audition for a tap-dancing librarian in summer stock was really doing much to " enlighten " anybody . After 10 years , sometimes these noble notions die out . <p> SO I left the sparkling and unreliable world of theater for the world of print . Journalism is refreshingly independent . You do n't need an agent to get you work ; just a pen , a notebook , curiosity , and a liking for words . And in terms of carrying out that desire to enlighten , journalism is a very appropriate vehicle . I never looked back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to me . Gladly gave up the rejections that were n't based on talent or even looks , but on type . I do admit to missing the walk onstage into bright lights and knowing , before I even got there , that I would say a certain line and people would laugh . I do miss that . <p> Perhaps the biggest relief in changing professions was getting my name back . No more spelling it out . No more little voice whispering , " Liar . " And that 's good . The funny thing is , I met another Catherine Foster , who oddly enough is also a journalist . She moved to my street and we started getting each other 's calls . Despite the ensuing confusion , I never felt tempted to change my phone listing . I had a life that had grown into and filled out my name . That 's not to say it ca n't stand a little tinkering . My friends have all come up with new variations : Cathe ( like cave ) , Cathwick , Cathers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I find that endearing . But I have learned , to paraphrase Henry David Thoreau , to " Beware of enterprises requiring new names . "
