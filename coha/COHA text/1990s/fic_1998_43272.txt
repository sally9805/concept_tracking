Beneath the crucifix , the priest stands . His hands rest atop the pulpit and he stands as if the heat and . humidity of the dark morning neither bother him under his thick robes nor even exist . He does not appear as short as he really is , his five feet of height made tall by the long yellow stripes that run down his gown . He seems to tower above altar boy , congregation , and altar-solely there and solely alive . He barely moves . All that can be seen moving of him are his lips , ushering forth the listless drone of his prayers to the massed church . His voice , deep and monotonous , emanates from the loudspeaker like some ethereal hum that seems to come not from him but the walls . When he pauses , only the whir of the oscillating wall fans can be heard . Above him , the immense crucifix is suspended from the ceiling and hangs over him like a cloud . It is both gruesome and beautiful . Soft green lights from the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the darkness of the church . <p> The east and west porches lead to huge doors that open to the still early morning . Outside the silence remains of night . Before long , the noise of morning traffic-of bicycles and cars and the pounding of houses under construction-and the patter clamor of street vendors and pedestrians and spry children will drown the city . But now , only the incessant droning of the priest 's voice can be heard-it is the vacuum of everything for an hour . And they , the men and women segregated to their sides by a center aisle , listen and bow their heads as if it is and must be their food for Sunday morning . <p> Communion begins . Those who choose to go file down the aisle toward the altar : arms crossed , faces grim , their gait quick but unhurried . They wear the effortless look of sluggish anger in their faces , and yet there is a sincere blessedness in how they move and seem to merge toward the altar . Some walk with rosaries hanging from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others merely walk . There is no music , just the sound of whirring wall fans and shuffling sandals . The women go in one line and are dressed in thin and colorful ao dai 's , which split at the waist sides and follow down to their knees . As they walk down the aisle one after the other , their loose white pants flow with the slight air of their moving legs . The men wear dark slacks and plain colorless dress shirts with the top buttons unbuttoned . Their eyes are dry and stagnant . As they all approach the altar , they diverge to the sides and form a row on each side of the altar in front of the front pews . The priest then makes his way down the row , nourishing them each , one by one , with the Eucharist , his eyes not on them but on the wafer-the round white piece of glory between his fingers-that he places on their tongues . Once or twice , a communicant in waiting will nudge another who either forgets or is too slow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find different seats . <p> As communion ends , morning seeps through the side doors . From behind the congregation , the front doors of the church find light as well . The drone of the priest 's voice again permeates the air . He looks now as he did when he began Mass : bare of fatigue and emotion . Although he is not old , he attains the stateliness of age , exuding dignity and respect like a veiled sun . There is a quiet perplexity in his manner that is reverently distant and yet warrants neither hate nor fear . In some ways , he is lovely , possessing the kind of beauty that holiness subdues . And still he becomes somehow impenetrable and gray , at times a hazy image of a man : his stoic face the culminating dream of God , his eyes salty and glorious . Upon his finishing prayer , an " Aaaaah-men " breathes forth from the cavernous church . He bows to the tabernacle and the choir follows with their singing . Flanked by two altar boys , he then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to toll-one two , one two . At this , the people of the congregation leave as quietly as they had come . Their steps are fleeting as the light filters in and they filter out . Outside , in the new morning , their voices erupt and merge into the sounds and noises of the awakened city . <p> The priest is ready for his morning walk . It is a walk he takes every Sunday after the morning Mass . The sun is warm today but does not bother him . He begins at the back of the church and makes his way on the red-bricked walk that winds around the church grounds . As he walks , he puffs delicately on a long filtered cigarette . Rose tendrils and dandelions fall over the pathway like tresses , and every ten paces he passes potted frangipani trees whose lavish white flowers periodically distract him . His path is cooled by the shade of trees planted ages ago . The trees stand just outside the iron fence that follows the path around the church . Like a green wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence . The leaves of the tallest trees cast marvelous shadows onto the church wall , like a black mural that slowly grows and then shrinks as the day passes . If he tries hard enough , he will sometimes see images in them . Today , they are flying dragons , moving like snakes in the sky . The priest watches them move forever across the church wall , and as the smoke from his cigarette rises in the still air , he imagines their nostrils breathing flames . They fly toward the sun , he thinks , and smiles momentarily . The sun does not bother him today . He is too comfortable in the shade-too busy walking and admiring the flowers and the shadows-to be bothered by the heat . His cassock drapes his small form , and as he walks , its lower half undulates like tinged water . His cigarette burns slowly between the fingers of the clenched fist he cradles in his other hand . <p> At the front of the church , he stops at the graves of the two priests who came before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtyard . One is above ground and resembles a stone casket . It is framed by a wrought iron fence . The other lies level to the ground with a gray marble surface that reflects the tree branches from above . A colorful wreath of flowers is placed at its head . A grim black and white photograph of the late priest is encased in the marble just below the wreath , easily warding off curious children who play in the courtyard of the church . Today , however , the priest notices dried mud-prints that run across the engravings . He kneels down to brush it off with his hand , muttering to himself , " These children have no fear or respect for anything- " But then he sees that the footprints are quite large and thinks , Their parents are no better . He stands up to assess his efforts and grimaces when he sees that the prints are not totally gone . He looks around for the yard lady who tends to the church grounds . She is nowhere in sight . He smokes his cigarette with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he faces the streets . For the first time this morning , he notices the world that spreads itself not twenty feet from the open gates of the church . The city suddenly comes alive before his eyes and in his ears : enormous and incoherent . He watches the cars and bicycles and motorbikes pass in droves on the street and hears their blaring horns and shifting gears . They move while the houses and buildings stand still like a wall around the church ; they move and reverberate within a vivid haze of faces and bodies and voices and sighs : the din of people chattering and enterprising-the colors of fresh paint and fading hues-the figures of shop-owners in front of their housesthe markets of fish fruit vegetables drinks medicine clothes and breadthe multitude of wanderers , of roving children with dark , luminous eyes , even of those who sit quietly as though they are dead-the fleeting drift of beating sandals and scattered bare feet : everything converges in his mind and becomes a blazing visage and sound to him , like an unfiltered reflection of something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches it as a fisherman watches the sea-knowing and envisioning seemingly everything ( every face , building , brick , and crevice ) and yet it all defies him still . The city with its people is at once magnificent and chaotic , moving and flashing before him as if out of some dream . He feels a need to understand it , a desire to embrace it in a way . As he gazes on he is thinking : What chaos and yet If eel as if I share in it . . . as if this is my work and my life , as if God is breathing life into me to bear whatever shame or consequence this is .... But then it always eludes him , and he is left to wonder if shame is to him a useless emotion . He takes another deep draw from his cigarette . <p> A beggar woman approaches him from the street . She moves slowly onto the courtyard , speaking at a distance where he is unable to hear her . As she nears him , she reaches out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for her to be half the height she once was , and her clothes cover her bowed body like a frayed bandage . Her head is a web of white , bristled hair that resembles some leafbird 's crude nest . She continues muttering and speaking as if it is something she does as easily and as often as breathing . With teeth dyed black and a pair of black assaulting eyes , she resembles a tired ghost . " Father , Father , Father , " he finally hears her moan , " I beg of you , do kind for me-see to it your poor child does not die ; anything will do Father , only enough to see me through this day . " <p> He does not budge . The cigarette remains in his fist , burning slowly . His implacable glare upon her is hard , and looking down , in his hollow voice , he says to her , " Woman , have you no respect ? Why do you beg for money outside the house of God ? " He hesitates severely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my church ? " <p> At this , she recoils as if afraid of him . But after a moment , she stiffens and gives him a brutal look . Then she turns and drags herself away . She is already looking for someone else to pity her . He watches her quietly , almost humorously , and she knows it for she glances back at him repeatedly , each time her eyes giving him that glare of wounded spite . Eventually she exits the gates and fades into the blur of the streets , and he loses her . <p> He returns his attention again to searching the grounds for the yard lady . She finally appears around the corner , a round and short woman with a brisk walk . She is nearly two decades older than he is , but her head is far from white . Her hair she wears held back in a ball and it shines in the sun . She wears a gardening glove on her right hand and in the other carries a pair of shears A small trash bag hangs at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she is pruning a potted bush . She looks up and sees him . She bows to him . " Good-morning , Father . " Her voice is pleasant and sincere but sounds strange against the ironed dimness of her face . " Do n't stay too long in the sun , Father , the heat will ruin you today . " She promptly returns her attention to the bush . <p> " Yes , yes , " he answers lightly , looking up and then around the grounds . " But how do you stand it all day ? " He looks back at her and watches her stolidly . <p> " Oh , the hope of rain and occasional shade-and of course my flowers will die without me . " She snips away at the bush with controlled ease , her gloved hand running over it as if she is feeling for signs of imperfection . " They , too , can be ruined in the sun . " <p> " Ah , they are beautiful today . " <p> " Thank you , Father . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a sculpture and then moves on to a frangipani tree that is a step away . Taking each leaf and examining it , she seems to caress the tree with her fingers . She rearranges some branches that loop and droop and pulls out some slightly withered leaves , putting those in the trash bag . She does not look at the priest but does not turn her back to him either . <p> He says : " I have been considering closing and locking the gates . Perhaps we can leave them open on Sundays , but I think it is best that we keep them closed when there is no Mass . " <p> She stops . She turns to him with an unchanged expression . Her gloved hand now holds the shears by the blades . " How about the children , Father ? " <p> " The children ? " He senses the changed tone of her voice . <p> " The children . Where will they play ? " <p> " There must be other places that they can go ! " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone has changed , but there is no will or persuasion in it . She speaks as though she is consoling . " This is where their fathers and mothers want them to play-this is where their mothers and fathers played as children . The bad kids can go wherever they want , but the good kids-the little ones-what is a church without them yelling and laughing outside ? " <p> He is no longer looking at her . He is silent . It is not an angry silence . His cigarette has gone out and only the filter remains between his fingers . His eyes are fixed on the front grounds . The courtyard takes up half the area and is naked to the sun . Red brick stretches it twenty-five meters before him to where green grass begins . In the distance , about fifty meters away , two iron gates stand open . Two white walkways follow from the gates and then merge into a wider center walkway that leads up to the courtyard and then to the front porch of the church . Two lines of towering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grassy grounds into a deep green shadow . The same iron fence encloses the grounds . Every fifteen paces alongside the fence stands a stone bench surrounded by potted flowers . <p> The yard lady resumes her work . Again she does not look at him . It is as if they have not even spoken . Her hands work swiftly but softly , her face bearing the look of affable indifference . Perhaps she wonders why he is silent . Perhaps she even believes he is admiring her work . But then her manner will not show this . It is untroubled . She continues quietly with her pruning as he stands there , trapped in a dormant gaze . The two stand barely a yard apart but seem severed from each other by a wall of silence . The only sound is the rhythmic snipping of her shears kit ! kit ! as now a slight breeze slips between and around them . It is not a cold silence but is something more of a distance . It is as if they both stand in recognition of themselves but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , as if going further would be needless and a waste of time . Therefore , they merely stand , each within some depth of mind that is impenetrable and inconsequential to the other so that the sight of them both becomes ordinary and almost peaceful . <p> Suddenly he says , " Ong Quan-what does he do ? " His voice is calm but sharp , within it a muted urgency as though he has been spending the last five minutes trying to formulate a question for his thoughts . <p> The yard lady does not respond immediately . Her hands are still moving ; her eyes roam across the scene around them , trying to match the familiarity of that name with a face or a body in the distance . She sees people she knows passing in the streets . Some may see her too but they do not wave . To the left of the church , facing it at an angle , is a small cafe . A hand-painted sign hangs outside and reads : Quan Cafe Mai Tram . It is a shabby place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a faded canopy gives shade to those customers sitting outside , one of whom is Quan . He is sitting on an old red plastic stool that barely accommodates his bottom . His knees are much higher than the stool or the wooden table that holds his ashtray and his drink . He taps ashes into the ashtray , seeming to stare at nothing . His sandals are off his feet and lie to the side , turned over . <p> " Him , " she finally says , not yet looking at the priest or slowing down her work on the frangipani tree . " He is a barber , Father . " " Then why is he not cutting people 's hair ? " She does not say anything , apparently taking his words as a remark and not a question . <p> He continues : " It has been almost four years since I 've seen him at Mass-any Mass . And this morning was no exception . Why does he sit there so lazily ? " <p> She glances at the priest . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , blandly . <p> " A man who cuts other people 's hair should have enough time to go to church every morning , not to mention Sunday morning . But I 'm sure God is not on his mind right now . " His voice is now gently rising , his eyes fixed and brilliant . He says : " What kind of man just sits and does nothing ? Do I not speak loud enough or is idleness now a virtue ? I doubt if he even knows me now since God and I mean nothing to him , " and he repeats the words in his head , I mean nothing to him , God means nothing to him , I mean nothing to him . <p> They stand silent . <p> The yard lady 's hands have ceased moving . She too is now staring at Quan . Her face has not yet lost any of its warmth or placidity , but there is about it suddenly a slight firmness that is both cautious and patient . " It was the grandfather , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze that is sweeping loose strands of hair across her forehead . " Everything changed when he died , but for some reason , Ong Quan felt nothing but regret . It was all regret- " She hesitates momentarily . She speaks as though to herself : " Regret for what he had done , what he had not done-all the time wasted and everything that did n't turn out right . And he had wanted so much , you see-no one could have known how much he really cared . I do n't think he even knew how much he cared . It took him years just to believe that the grandfather truly hated him , and by then , I do n't think he returned the hate as much as he was saddened by it . No-Quan felt no great hatred for the old man . Not even hate at all but just an angry grief . No one could have possibly known . On that last day , you would have been blind to not see the bitterness and hatred on Quan 's face . But I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her voice rises now and is more animated . " At first , it was the sisters-the three beautiful ones . They knew deep inside right when they first set eyes on him that he was the wrong man for their sister . It might have been because they were expecting somebody else-somebody totally different-and were just too disappointed to accept him . And if it was n't that , it was the way he never seemed to try to want to impress them and maybe change their mind about him . But whatever it was , they knew he was all wrong , not right at all . And they loved their sister too much , Father , to let her marry someone that wrong . But you know , they were not cruel ; at least they did n't mean to be . They never said anything at first because they thought she would grow out of him . They just watched and stayed quiet , waiting and probably even praying for her to let go of him . Of course , that never happened , and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they started it all-He 's an uneducated Southerner , sister . He never says anything , sister . How will he support you ? He 's too skinny . You 're too good for him . He 's ugly . But their sister loved him anyway . She thought he was kind and devout and felt that that was enough for her and she did n't want or need anything else . Still , she was n't entirely angry at her sisters for what they said . She knew them and what they wanted and that , all in all , they were just doing what they felt was best for her , and you know , Father , they really were . It was just such a mess of a thing . <p> " Then it was the grandmother . She was different . She loved every one of her four daughters , and with Ba Hoang she was almost supportive in the beginning . She thought that maybe her oldest daughter was wise enough to choose her own husband even if he was dumb , southern , quiet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five and needed to start a family soon-it was not sin what they were doing . He could not really be that bad . But then she began hearing what her other daughters were saying , and I think she changed her mind , not because of what they said but because of the fact that they were saying it . She did n't want any of that-the fussing and the bad talking and certainly not the resentment . The last thing she wanted to see was a family that hated itself . For anyone , it would have been horrible ; for her , it would have been unbearable . And so she stopped defending him and just stayed quiet when her daughters mentioned anything about him . <p> " And so after her , it was the grandfather . But then I think he actually disliked Quan from the very beginning too , but just never showed it . He never really said anything at all about it . He just kept to his corner of the house-he always sat at the end of the blue couch by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . You 'd think he was a stranger to the issue . He did go to the wedding-everyone did-and did everything that the bride 's father was supposed to do . But then he never smiled once that day . He had on that look of total disinterest , like the one he wore when Ong Quan asked him for permission to marry Ba Hoang . He said , Yes , if she wants you , ' sounding as if he had rehearsed saying it for months and was now only reciting . There was a slight mourning in his voice , but you would n't have known by seeing his face . He said nothing else until finally Quan got up and left because he knew too that there was really nothing left to say . And the grandmother knew it also , for she only sat there and let her husband say it for her , hearing the words and looking as if she had already accepted the fact that nothing would ever be the same . <p> " But for Quan , it was much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was slow and maybe even a little stupid , Father , but he really did love that woman-I 'm sure of that . He was so much in love with her that he ignored what they said about him . He would overhear their conversations , sometimes read the whispers and translate the looks , and he probably even agreed with them most of the time-he knew what he was . But the fact that she never stopped loving him made him love her even more and ignore completely after a while anything that they said or could say about him . It did n't seem to bother him . He just stayed quiet and talked only when he was spoken to and the rest of the time faded into the background . It could have been bearable , I guess . Except that the grandfather still saw Quan as the stranger in the house . Treated him like one . Like some daily ghost that he had to ignore . The old man had absolutely nothing to do with him-never even said a word to him outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' But then Quan had somehow already accepted all of this . <p> " When the first child-and you may not remember this , Fatherbut when the first child was born the grandfather did not go to the baptism . He said , ' I do n't need to go ; I 'm too sick and would just burden the whole ceremony with my coughing . ' And that was all he said about the matter and they never tried to reason with him because they knew why . At least Ba Hoang did . Ong Quan , I think , tried not to believe it . He was even careful enough to name the boy after the grandfather 's father , hoping that maybe that would make the grandfather happy . But it did n't seem to work because when the second child was born , both the grandfather and the grandmother skipped the baptism . There was no reason this time . They just did n't go . And of course this destroyed Ba Hoang because she had known all the time the reasons , but just could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was slow , too ) . And the fact that it happened a second time made her realize that he would eventually some day know everything . When the third child was bornthe second daughter-there was almost no one there at the baptism . Quan 's parents had already died and the rest of his family lived far out in the country . It was only him and Hoang and their daughter and first daughter and their only son . No one else showed up . Ba Hoang cried all through the ceremony ; the baby 's head was wet not because of baptism water but because she was crying over it-that soft , uncontrollable , almost angry crying . But Ong Quan , he did n't cry . His face was the same blank face he always had : his eyes staring into space as if he were looking at himself and was both sad and a little confused . He had to have known then that there was nothing he could do to make them love his children ; it was not his fault exactly and yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think he really understood why . Maybe in the back of his mind he knew why but just could n't see the help of the ' knowing ' and so accepted everything to make up for being helpless . " <p> The yard lady pauses for a moment . She seems to linger on purpose , almost waiting for the words to come again from her lips . She is still staring at Quan as is the silent priest . The two seem oblivious of each other . <p> She continues : " They lived only a block away from the house . Ba Hoang was a teacher and taught in the day . The children stayed at home where a neighbor looked after them while Quan and Hoang were at work . Actually , Ong Quan asked the neighbor to stay with them until the evening even though he usually stopped cutting hair at around three or four o'clock in the afternoon . After he closed his shop , he would go over to the grandparents ' house and sit . And sit , Father , was all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They just went about their business . The sisters cleaned and dusted the house , sometimes even wiping the floor by his feet without saying a single word to him . Once in a while , someone would ask him a question or say a word or two to him , and he would always answer them politely but never did say anything more than he had to . The grandmother was usually upstairs , out of sight , so he never heard a word from her . The grandfather , though , stayed downstairs and sat quietly in his corner of the house , reading or smoking but never talking to anybody during the time Quan was there ( he did n't even cough ) . But Quan still came-every day , right about three or four o'clock : coming in quietly , leaving his sandals at the door , and then sat himself in the chair by the front door where he smoked his cigarettes and ashed them in a plastic ashtray he took with him from the shop . No one ever seemed to notice him coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes even fooling around and laughing hysterically with each other , and the next second , they spotted him from the corner of their eyes sitting in the chair by the front door , smoking quietly : his face blank , his eyes blinking every few seconds and staring either outside at the street or inside at nothing . An hour or so later , they would glance back at him and he would be gone . They never could get used to it . But then they never told him to go away either and never did anything except not say a word to him-they did n't want to be mean or cold but just could n't see the use of coming to a place where you did n't talk and no one talked to you . They figured that maybe he did it because he wanted pity ; so they never showed him any . But I do n't think he was looking for pity . No ; there was no pain in his eyes or his face-nothing you could see that was sadness or a need for attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he walked in and sat down carefully as if to disturb no one ; the way he smoked his cigarettes slowly and methodically , lowering his head every once in a while to wipe his hands on his legs or shift his legs or light up another cigarette or just stare at the floor . Perhaps he came to wait . What he waited for , you could n't tell . And maybe , probably , he did n't know what he was waiting for-or even what he wanted . But still he came and sat there , maybe waiting for himself to figure out the reason or reasons . <p> " One day , one of the sisters came over to see Ba Hoang and gently , almost whispering , asked her , Why does he come every day ? We both know Father does not want him there . ' And Hoang looked at her younger sister with that look of confused anger and said quietly , Do you want him there ? ' And when her sister did n't answer , Hoang said one more thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister said nothing . She only hugged her older sister and kissed her softly on the cheek and then left . It was not until an hour later that Hoang finally cried because she could no longer hold it in her and just had to let it all come out like it had so many times before . <p> " Then one day the oldest boy was hit by a car just outside the grandfather 's house . Quan was just coming up the road from his shop when he saw it happen . When he rushed over to him , the boy was lying motionless on the ground , covered in blood that was running from his ears . It soaked his shirt and made the dirt road under him a dark , dark brown . All Quan did was hold the boy in his arms and look at him . He was n't even crying . He just looked at the boy with a quiet sadness and massaged the bloody ear with his hand . A huge crowd gathered around them but did nothing but stare and see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was acting all crazy and scared like he had just damned himself , calling out to Quan to get the boy in the car so he could take him to the hospital . But Quan just ignored him and stayed where he was . Then the grandfather came running out and saw what had happened and saw the crazy driver yelling and screaming and Quan just sitting there with the boy in his arms . He went up to Quan and said sharply , Put the boy in the car . ' And Quan said nothing ; did n't even move an inch . And then the grandfather , you could see the anger coming up in his face , and he reached down and tried to pull the boy out of Quan 's arms . But then Quan suddenly pulled the boy back and shoved the old man away with his bloodied hand . The old man stepped back , shocked and furious , looking as if he had just been touched by the devil with Quan 's red handprint across the belly of his shirt . Quan glared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from him before , like he was breathing the words out in someone else 's voice , You ca n't do anything now . It 's too late for you now . ' It was vicious-both what he said and how he said it . Everyone there felt it . The grandfather felt it the most-he looked like someone had just slapped him . He tried to say something but it never came out . By then , everyone was silent and all you could hear was the muffled sound of the grandmother crying behind the grandfather . He was still standing , but he looked tired and worn , like he would have fallen over willingly had someone just pushed him . <p> " Finally , the sisters ran to get Ba Hoang , and when she got there , it was only she who was able to pry the boy out of Quan 's arms . They took the boy to the hospital , but a neighbor man had to drive because the driver had already fled without anyone noticing . They left everyone standing there telling themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't . He only hears badly out of that ear now . The grandfather , though , died a week later . Everyone said it had to be because of what had happened . The sisters and the grandmother knew it was because in the week before he died , all they saw was that look he had when Quan said those words to him . The strange thing , Father , was that on the day of his funeral , Quan showed up after his wife and his children did and sat at the back of the church . And for the first time that the family could remember , they saw him cry : not loudly but very softly-all to himself and all through the ceremony . And I think all of them began to realize that maybe he was not what they thought he was . Or maybe he was what they thought he was but that now it appeared that they had to love him in spite of that . And after a while they forgave him for what he did . But it seemed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sisters and especially the grandmother started loving the children : playing with them , feeding them , hugging and kissing them . But all of this did not change the way Quan acted . He still came to the house every day ; except now , instead of sitting in the chair by the door , he sat on the end of the blue couch where the grandfather used to sit . He did n't ask anyone if he could , and I guess no one would have said no to him if he did . He just walked in one day and sat in that one spot , no longer using an ashtray he brought from the shop but instead ashing into the one the grandfather had used . And the sisters talked to him , sometimes sitting down to do it . The grandmother tried that too , but usually her eyes would well up with tears after looking at him sitting there and so she would have to get up and leave . His children usually went there after school and their mother also after work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking . The sisters-all four of them now-laughed and talked and teased each other like sisters again . There were no more whispers and no more quiet looks . Not that Quan was looking , because he still acted the same as he always did . They seemed finally to be a whole family even though he never did change the way he looked . " <p> The yard lady ceases . She is perfectly still . All this time , she and the priest have not once looked at each other ; their eyes have stayed upon Quan , and Quan has not yet moved except to light another cigarette . The priest turns to her now with a look of abject amazement , almost seeming to say to her with his eyes : Woman , how do you know all of this ? But he does n't say anything . He only looks at her with that desperate need to ask something . She should be tired from all she has said but it looks as if she has not said even a word and that it was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening . One hand moves up to brush the strands of hair from her forehead . The other stays at her side , holding onto the shears as if they are an extended appendage of her arm . The shears begin to move again , and she returns to the frangipani tree as though she stopped only a few seconds ago . <p> The priest suddenly pulls away from her and walks toward the front gate . He walks awkwardly , or at least it feels that way . It is a slow and a hasty walk , as if he is walking with all the people in the streets suddenly staring at him through the church fence , and the calm rigidity that once balanced itself so comfortably on his face is now breaking down into a naked look of caution and unreliable dissimulation . He is looking ahead of him but sees nothing but the thoughts running inside his head . He feels tempted to look back at the yard lady , but then knows for certain that she is still the same way he has left her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad steps , the back of his neck now feeling the warmth of the sun . <p> In the street , the throng of people passes before his eyes in an unsifting flush of sun and dust . They seem incapable of being culled from each other-meshed together like a stream of motion and sound and smell moving in and around him . He wonders if they notice him at all-if they would even recognize him without his cassock and his beads and cross . They pass and come at him , tilting heads and turning elbows and lifting bags and adjusting their paths to avoid blocking his . But none seems to see him . In the near distance is the cafe where Quan sits , unchanged . He is a vague figure , and the priest is looking neither at him nor at the cafe ; he is looking only in front of him , somehow unable to imagine what is at his back . As he walks , obscure memories rush through his mind . Memories that for some reason feel new and fresh and yet as old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers giving the eulogy at the grandfather 's funeral years ago . It surprises him how vivid it is in his head . He recalls even the people who were there-what they wore and what they said , even how they cried . And yet he had forgotten it so completely that it would have been senseless to him yesterday . He begins to remember all the people who have died in the parish and all the funerals that he has overseen-all the graves and gravestones and their shapes-sizes-colors made fine in memory now by their very having been forgotten-for now , it seems , he has seen them all . They are clear as thoughts before sleep . And yet still , there is that fear co-mingling with the memories as if he must focus on something to make these memories enough . Because they are not . They are uncomfortable and strange . Clear in his head and yet like a rock wedged in his brain , like an image of himself squeezed at this instant between all these people and their averted eyes and their children crying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices .... <p> He reaches the shade of the cafe 's canopy and stops . It is cool there and he feels his hair as if it has just been burnt by the sun . The smell of cigarettes and burnt coffee rises at him , thick and strong . Quan is sitting only ten feet from where he stands , but the priest does not look at him immediately . He scans the place slowly and casually before letting his eyes finally fall upon the gaunt and dark brown face . Quan 's eyes are sallow and their sockets large and caved in . He sits with a slack back and wears a dusty white T-shirt that distinctly shows his collarbone . He has an air about him that is wretched and pathetic . There is a sullen , almost childlike innocence in his demeanor , as if he is asking for nothing more than a stay from complication . The priest can not look at him without feeling both anger and sympathy . <p> Quan does not look directly at the priest even though his twitching eyes appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks over to him , he looks up , hall smiling , half with a look of slight bewilderment . The priest says nothing yet ; there is an awkward tenderness in his expression . They both seem to bear an invisible weight with their eyes . <p> Finally , Quan puts out his cigarette . " Father , " he says with a tone of slight surprise . " Good afternoon , Father . " He pauses and then says , stuttering , " Sit down , Father , please , " pulling up another plastic stool nearby . <p> " No-no thank-you , child , I 'll stand , " the priest slightly raises his fingers to gesture for him not to bother . There is a momentary silence again , but then he speaks kindly , " Tell me , Quan , I am only curious . How is your son 's ear ? " <p> Quan 's face is vacant at first . He looks tightly at the priest as if he is unsure of what the question means . But then his eyebrows rise as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Father , he is finevery fine . It 's not as perfect as it should be , but it 's very good now . " <p> A sudden expression of disappointment crosses the priest 's face but is immediately replaced by a placid smile . " Good , I am pleased to hear that , " he replies quietly-tentatively-not altogether certain if what he says is sufficient . Then he adds , " Nothing that you or I can do will ever foresee what God might do . " Quan nods agreeably , his eyes still bearing that invisible weight . <p> The priest 's demeanor changes as he brings his hands together and clasps his fingers . His first words come out with a slow uncertaintyand he hears them uttered in hollow succession-and then the rest follow hastily , " Tell me , child , so that I might know-why do you never go to Mass ? " <p> And now Quan 's demeanor changes . His eyes have overcome the weight and now glisten with a bright awareness . His shape seems no longer weary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table now cease moving . He is still looking up at the priest with confusion , but it is no longer a nervous confusion . He gazes at the priest as though the priest were some odd transformation of the real thingsomething grim and contrived and not entirely there . And there is not so much shock in his face as there is curiosity . " But Father , " he says firmly , innocently , almost kindly , " I do . " <p> The priest says nothing . He only stares at Quan with a look of disrupted strength , somewhere between foolishness and idle discomfiture . He feels as if he should respond but the words already feel tired and meaningless to him , as though to say them would be to prolong the embarrassment of the moment . If it were any other situation he would have admitted his lapse of memory and moved on to other things . But now , it seems his strength to do so has failed him . An altogether useless effort , he thinks , because at the pit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , of learning that the world had been reborn and he was there but somehow missed it entirely . From the other corner of the cafe he hears the suddenly loud conversation between two men . They talk and he listens to them to avoid Quan 's eyes . . <p> . . you disagree , but I tell you , there is more to it than thatMore ? What more can there be ? <p> Let me finish because , you see , the boy just returned yesterday . Yesterday ? <p> Yes . Walked in and straight to his mother the first thing he says is , he tells her she does n't have to worry another day in her lifeWhy did n't she slap him ? <p> Yes , but she did n't . You see , that old woman cursed the boy for months after he left but she never loved him any less . His coming back was enough . And when he came with a new face and his expensive clothes , and all the new dresses and jewelry for her , she of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost wept when she saw them and her son back from all that time , rich now and almost handsome with his clothes and everything <p> But the boy <p> Wait-it does n't matter how he got them . Not to him and not to her . <p> Why ? The boy probably stole them - and left his mother to do it . <p> Yes , he could have stolen them ; he could have done many things to get them . But that is n't important . <p> Not important ? <p> No . Because it was all she had always wanted-everything she had ever talked about one day having . No one forced him to do it ; no one reminded him . The boy remembered and he came back . And that 's all that matters . ... <p> The priest hears them no more . Seeing that Quan has long cast his eyes away from him and down to the ground , the priest turns around and looks back at the yard lady . She is still in the courtyard and is now bent over cleaning the marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and he can see her arms move back and forth in wide strokes across the marble grave . He watches her with uncertain anger . From where he stands , she is so far away , and the noise between them is grinding , grinding . <p>
