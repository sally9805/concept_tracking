<p> IF YOU TURNED ON CBS THIS MORNING ' IN late May , you might have seen Henry Kissinger standing in front of a map of the U.S. and feared that the world was coming to an end . In a way , it was , which is the main reason 1991 was such a fascinating year to be alive and in front of a television . It was a year that saw the first appearance by a former secretary of state as a morning-show weatherman , a TV-friendly war narrated by Scud Studs , a live coup attempt in Russia , Los Angeles policemen starring in America 's Most Racist Home Videos and a congressional hearing in which U.S. senators piously discussed the oeuvre of Long Dong Silver . But as tumultuous as life on the small screen seemed to be , there was even more drama behind the scenes , as the Big Three networks - CBS , ABC and NBC - faced the Soviet-scale dissolution of their empires . <p> It was the year NBC 's Brandon Tartikoff defected to the movies and Johnny Carson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good career moves . In June an FCC report concluded that broadcast television . . . has suffered an irreversible long-term decline in audience and revenue share . ' The next month ABC chief Robert Iger predicted the demise of one of the Big Three and suggested that networks would soon be unable to afford programming for all their time periods . When asked what it was like to be a major player in a declining industry , Iger said : The good news is , I 've been invited to the dance . The bad news is , all the women have gone home . ' <p> If those women are anything like the women on network prime time , they 're having babies or dying . The landscape was littered with more random death and pregnancy than is found in even the most turgid of hospital soap operas . Murphy Brown is pregnant ; Amen 's Thelma gave birth during the May sweeps ; and rebellious sister Teddy was fertilized on Sisters . The obnoxious children who fill Full House were getting too old to satisfy viewers ' voracious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lori Loughlin spurted out twins during the November sweeps . Even Dinosaurs hatched got into the act , hatching a big-eyed ratings-raising reptile named Baby Sinclair . <p> Real pregnancies were the big story on TV news . 60 Minutes honcho Don Hewitt fired reporter Meredith Vieira rather than give her maternity leave . Good Morning America 's Joan Lunden popped out another one , and Deborah Norville 's rephrase : pregnancy raised Today 's ratings , but only after she was replaced by Katie Couric . NBC made the replacement permanent after People photographed Norville breast-feeding her baby and quoted her as saying , If he screams that he wants to eat , Mommy 's restaurant is open . ' Couric , who gave birth in July , has wisely kept her restaurant closed to the public . <p> Annie Potts was also really pregnant , so the producers of Designing Women had her character get artificially inseminated , get pregnant , miscarry and vow to try again - in one episode . When Katey Sagal , of Married . . . With Children , started to show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a real miscarriage . ( The writers made the whole pregnancy plot Al Bundy 's nightmare . ) This should not be confused with the fake miscarriage Susan Dey had on L.A. Law because impregnator Jimmy Smits had left the series . At the end of last season , even Cheers 's Sam Malone had decided to conceive . But the concept was dropped this season . There are so many babies , ' said Cheers producer Cheri Eichen . There is n't room in the nursery for others . ' <p> But you can bet L.A. Law 's Rosalind Shays would rather have been made pregnant than fatally splattered on the bottom of an elevator shaft . Other sacrifices to the ratings gods : Gary on thirtysomething is dead , squashed by a truck , as is his series , squashed by ABC . The producers of Doogie Howser , M.D. decided that kids needed to learn to face death , so they killed off Doogie 's girlfriend 's mother . The producers of The Young Riders , no doubt sharing similar noble sentiments , plan to kill off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90210 deep-sixed a cast member during the November sweeps . J.R . on Dallas seemed to have shot himself , and Major Nelson on I Dream of Jeannie died off camera sometime before this year 's I Still Dream of Jeannie , but Larry Hagman , who plays them both , feels just fine . Not Redd Foxx , though . Foxx really died after a heart attack on the set of The Royal Family . In a unique memorial tribute , the producers of the show quickly announced that the death of Foxx 's character would be featured in a November ( sweeps month ) episode that would also introduce his replacement , Jackee from 227 . <p> Michael Landon 's death inspired television to new depths of necrophilia , with the last pilot he worked on , Us , and the two-hour Michael Landon : Memories With Laughter and Love getting good ratings . But most incredible of all is an infomercial ' ( TV 's euphemism for a commercial that lasts as long as a show ) that Landon starred in for study-improvement tapes , which will run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sincere dead man works wonders : 10,000 to 15,000 copies of the tape sets now sell every week ; only 5000 to 10,000 sold when less sincere , more alive John Ritter was doing the ads . Michael Landon has never been busier , a tribute not so much to the immortality of his work as to the grave-robbing desperation of his medium . <p> About the only place death was n't present on TV was on the most successful show of 1991 , the Persian Gulf War . The war that the Pentagon let us see on TV , and that their media lap dogs eagerly presented to us , was an affair in which video-game-style bombs slipped neatly into dens of pure evil , destroying them and ensuring that America could continue to forgo car pools . With the exception of one twenty-second tracking shot of an incinerated column of retreating Iraqi soldiers , the war was a G-rated story narrated by people standing in front of planes and American flags . Second-stringers like Wolf Blitzer and Arthur Kent became overnight celebrities ; CNN scooped the Big Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting and dying ( according to newspapers ) began , Sally Jessy Raphael hosted a show on beauty make-overs for the spouses of Persian Gulf warriors . The Iraqis seemed to understand who was running the show : When the ground war started , they immediately began surrendering to reporters . <p> As suspenseful as watching the war was , it was no match for the **36;801;TOOLONG suspense of its aftermath , as the networks , having found in General Norman Schwarzkopf an engaging toastmaster , dragged out the patriotic celebration ' to greater and greater lengths . The sight of Schwarzkopf singing onstage with Mickey Mouse was something no combination of hallucinogens could have produced . TV was busy showing joyous flag-waving and sniffling while an unbowed Saddam massacred Kurds , but we did n't care anymore - we had changed the channel . The victory hoopla reached into the summer , taking twice as long as the war it celebrated the ending of . By June 29th , Stormin ' Norman was named TV Person of the Year by TV Guide . His interview with Barbara Walters and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show - a record that remained unbroken until video footage of an exorcism was broadcast three weeks later . <p> Nonetheless , the networks were quick to use the war as a scapegoat when ratings for the last season turned out to be the worst in recent history . If war coverage had n't preempted so many shows , the networks whined , they would have made a lot more money . It seems that a war , no matter how one-sided or patriotic , just does n't excite sponsors the way Who 's the Boss ? does . <p> Later this fear of losing sponsor dollars in the face of real events took on a bizarre new dimension . On October 11th , Dan Rather apologetically told viewers that coverage of the historic Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings was going off the air so that CBS could televise a baseball playoff game ( after all , someone has to sell beer and trucks ) and then said , Of course , the hearings can be seen on other stations . ' This came on the heels of PBS and NBC 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks would be sharing coverage of next year 's presidential conventions . History has become a hot potato that no network can afford to hold for very long . <p> The fragmentation of the networks ' empires really became evident when their affiliates - the equivalent of those pesky Soviet republics - started falling out of line and making unheard-of demands . The weakened networks allowed the affiliates to add five minutes ( to be filled , for the most part , with commercials ) to their eleven-o'clock-news slot , meaning that The Tonight Show now starts at 11:35 . And NBC allowed KCRA , its affiliate in Sacramento , California , to start prime time an hour early , at 7:00 . KCRA and many other western stations assert that they are losing viewers to sleep . <p> Have viewers gone to bed or just gone away ? The networks seem to be trying to sniff them out in cable . An ad campaign that CBS ran through the World Series previewed upcoming shows with a voice booming , It 's not on HBO , ' and It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago would have seemed ludicrous . ABC and Fox have decided that if you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em , initiating several cost-cutting coproductions with MTV , Nickelodeon and HBO . <p> But cable also had a bad year . Ridiculously under-regulated monopolies , local cable companies have hiked rates by sixty-one percent since ' 86 with little improvement in service ; the FCC announced it may increase competition by allowing the phone companies - those paragons of free-market capitalism - to carry video signals . The major cable networks , like their larger broadcast counterparts , have experienced a distressing downturn in viewership - they consider other cable stations to be the enemy . Cable is going to begin eating itself , ' said Scott Sassa , president of Turner Entertainment . <p> Through fiber-optic and compression technologies , new channels are sprouting like crab grass . Viewers will soon be able to choose between the Crime Channel ( a long-form America 's Most Wanted ) ; Court TV , the all-trial network ; and best yet , InfoNet , a spinoff of the Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Landon 's agent ) . Pay-per-view channels , a favorite of cable companies for obvious reasons , have also multiplied , siphoning movies and attractions from other channels and charging viewers up to $35.95 a show for premium fare , like Mike Tyson fights ( the ones with men ) , James Brown 's return-from-prison concert and new : the special Rock Video Girls . <p> The Formerly Big Three are thus left staring agog as they devolve from being the only game in town to being just three of a hundred channels , while trapped in a vicious cycle of mediocrity : Revenues are low , which means that expensive quality ' programs like I 'll Fly Away and Equal Justice have less time to find audiences , which means that they get canceled , which means that executives decide that quality ' programs are n't worth producing , which means that viewers desert the networks , which means that ratings drop , which means that revenues go lower . An accelerated quick-fix atmosphere has taken over - and you can bet it 'll take a lot more babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Quality has become too expensive , and real life too unprofitable , for most TV channels . What , then , is television 's future ? This question was answered last spring , during the NBC broadcast of the PGA Honda Classic . Steve Pate hooked his second shot on the seventy-second hole , and the ball was lost in tall grass to one side of the fairway . According to PGA rules , Pate had five minutes to play the ball before being assessed a costly penalty . Disaster was averted when an NBC replay revealed the ball 's location with only fifteen seconds to spare , helping Pate win a three-stroke victory in the tournament . <p> While TV 's future as an industry is uncertain , its future as a caddy is secure . <p> Finally , here are a few citations : <p> <p> THE YEAR 'S BEST SHOWS : House of Cards ( PBS ) : Political satire is alive and well - and living in England . <p> The Simpsons ( Fox ) : The hype and the ratings have subsided , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices like Dustin Hoffman and Michael Jackson new : ( or very good imitations ) . <p> Desert Storm ( CBS , NBC , ABC but mostly CNN ) : Covering the war left Dan Rather so shellshocked that his hair turned brown . <p> Northern Exposure ( CBS ) : Sure , a lot of shows have portrayed humans reincarnated as dogs , but this dog could act . <p> I 'll Fly Away ( NBC ) : Decent drama set in the civil-rights-era South . <p> Hearts of Darkness : A Filmmaker 's Apocalypse ( Showtime ) : A documentary tale of the excesses involved in the making of Francis Ford Coppola 's Apocalypse Now . <p> The Kids in the Hall ( HBO and Comedy Central ) : Sketch comedy is alive and well - and living in Canada . <p> MTV Unplugged ( MTV ) : Elvis Costello , Paul McCartney , R.E.M . and various rap acts turned in collectors ' - item performances . <p> Eerie , Indiana ( NBC ) : This sitcom , a Twin Peaks for preteens , is buried opposite 60 Minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rerun of the Masterpiece Theater classic . If you squinted your eyes , the togas looked like suits and Caligula like Dan Quayle . Honest . <p> The Clarence Thomas Confirmation Hearings ( NBC , ABC , CNN , PBS , C-Span and CBS between innings ) : Like watching a slow-motion car wreck . Hey , who put this hair on my typewriter ? <p> <p> IN THE REALM OF THE CENSORS : New ground was broken this year in menstruation , with Blossom , I 'll Fly Away , The Cosby Show and Life Goes On all centering episodes on a girl 's first period . But the Trojan War continues : While Doogie Howser and kids on Different World talk about using rubbers , condom ads remain taboo on prime time . Meanwhile , CBS , home of tasteful made-for-TV movies like Sins of the Mother , yanked Pee-wee 's Playhouse , one of the few shows on Saturday morning that were n't glorified ads for toys or cereal , after its star was arrested for jerking off . Pee-wee 's only crime , it seems , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of a CBS TV movie like the rest of us . <p> <p> TRASHIEST SHOWS : During one memorable May sweeps week , Donahue interviewed transsexuals , Geraldo chatted with Chippendales dancers and Penthouse Pets , and Sally Jessy Raphael hosted striptease dancers over the age of forty-five . Among game shows , sessions of watching Lifetime 's Shop ' til You Drop ( contestants must spend $1000 in ninety seconds ) or CBS 's Night Games ( contestants embarrass themselves for a date ) are best followed by chemical baths . A special nod must be given to the Palm Beach criminal-justice system , which scheduled William Kennedy Smith 's rape trial during sweeps weeks in November . <p> <p> SILVER LINING MEDAL : Aside from its innovative year round ' approach , which helped the acne-soap opera Beverly Hills , 90210 find an audience , Fox logged a disastrous year . But the network still found something to get excited about : Last season , ' said a Fox press release , the list of ten lowest-rated shows was entirely Fox programming .
