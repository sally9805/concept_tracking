<p> GREELEY - If baseball is a game of inches and football a game of yards , the Denver Broncos ' 1995 season will be a game of feet . The 8 feet between James Jones ' left shoulder and Michael Dean Perry 's right shoulder . <p> It 's there , right there , in the middle of the defensive line , where the Broncos ' season will turn . For the Broncos , those 8 feet constitute the most crucial patch of soil on the field . Sure , they 'll lose some battles on it , but that 's where they have to win the war . <p> And , for the first time in a long time , they 've got the strength to do it . <p> For years , the Broncos have sent boys to do men 's work in the middle of the defensive line . Greg Kragen , their starting nose tackle from 1986-93 , came out of Utah State at 245 pounds . He had to pitch a tent in the weight room to reach 260 . <p> Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Super Bowl XXII , the Broncos decided to beef up in the middle of the line . They selected Syracuse 's Ted Gregory in the first round of the draft . Trouble was , Gregory was a linebacker trapped in a nose-tackle 's body . <p> Five years later , Wade Phillips decided to shift Kenny Walker to the nose from defensive end . Walker , the second deaf player ever to make it in the NFL , weighed 260 at the time , up from the 250 he weighed on the day he was drafted . He refused , so he was released . <p> Walker was the smart one . He figured out that a 260-pound player ca n't survive in the NFL 's trenches . And finally , after more than a decade of propping up undersized overachievers as their first wall of defense , the Broncos front office has , too . <p> New coach Mike Shanahan barely had finished the opening credits on his first Broncos game film when he determined what his first order of business had to be . He had to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive linemen . Naturally big interior defensive linemen . <p> " It starts inside , " Shanahan said . " We were looking for people with great quickness and great strength . If you do n't have that type of strength inside , eventually you 're going to wear down . " <p> Shanahan was in the coaches ' box that day in Jack Murphy Stadium when the Redskins ran over the Broncos defensive line . There was n't any deception involved . It was 300-pound offensive linemen mowing down 260-pound defensive linemen . The Redskins did n't take the back roads to their 280 rushing yards . They went right down main street . <p> Armed with a seven-year contract , Shanahan is n't interested in starting trends . He wants to establish traditions . One is for the Broncos to have bulk in the interior of their defensive line . Forget sheer finesse , he 'll take brute force . <p> And so it was that the Broncos ' first two free-agent signees of the Shanahan era were Jones and Perry . Between them , they weigh in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , and the number reads 600 . <p> For Jones and Perry , the name of the game is maintaining their weight . They have n't had to pump iron to get there . They have to put down their forks to stay there . <p> The number defies the adjective , but Perry is a svelte 290 . His brother , William , is living proof of what Michael Dean could really amount to . At last look , the Fridge was at 370 and counting . <p> That 's the kind of bulk the Broncos have manning the middle these days . Finally . <p> " That 's very important , " Shanahan said . " If you 're trying to compete at 260-265 pounds , and you 've got a guy 295 pounds who 's the same type of athlete , obviously you 'd like that mass . But they have to be football players . That 's the key . <p> " There are a lot of people who are n't football players . We were going to go after some big guys inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves over the long haul . " <p> In Jones and Perry , he found them . <p> Do n't forget the defensive ends and linebackers and cornerbacks and safeties . They 'll all play big roles as the Broncos try to improve a defense that in 1994 was the worst in the NFL . Do n't forget them ; just do n't mention them before Jones and Perry . The big boys are driving ; everybody else is in the back seat . <p> Of all the checks Pat Bowlen wrote to sign free agents , the biggest ones were the first two . Jones received $ 1.25 million up front as part of a three-year , $ 4.8-million deal . Perry got $ 7.2 million for three years , including a $ 3 million signing bonus . <p> Why were they paid so much ? Because they mean so much . <p> " We have to set the tempo , no doubt about it , " Jones said . " That was our motto when we played in Cleveland . Things that are going to happen depend on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , it 's going to roll downhill . <p> " It 's really important that , up front , you control that line of scrimmage . You have to establish something . ' Hey , you 're not going to run it , and if you drop back and pass , you 're going to have guys in your face . ' That makes the job a lot easier for those guys behind us . " <p> Said Perry , " Any time you want to have a great defense , you 've got to control the middle of the field . It starts up front . It 's not only myself and J.J. , but Simon Fletcher and Dan Williams . I just think , with the four guys we 've got up front , we 're going to be a great defensive football team . You can throw last year out the window . We do n't have the same scheme or the same personnel . " <p> To Shanahan , what once was the Broncos ' biggest weakness has become one of the team 's genuine strengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anybody , " he said . " Until you get it done , you do n't know . But yeah , I 'm looking at that as being our strength . The thing we 've got to have come to the forefront is , who 's going to rush the passer ? Do we have the guy who can get to the quarterback ? " <p> Jones and Perry can get to the quarterback - Perry had 51 1/2 career sacks in seven years with the Browns - but they do n't necessarily have to . For them , it 's all about pressure . They do n't have to get a sack or a tackle , as long as they push the pile . <p> Pushing the pile . It 's a simple enough concept , but it 's something a Broncos interior lineman has n't done consistently since the days of Rubin Carter . If Jones and Perry can do it , opposing offensive lines will invariably respond with double-teams . That 's what starts the chain reaction , the one Bowlen paid all that money for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense for all these years . <p> With a double-team in the middle of the field , Fletcher will be matched man-to-man against the left tackle . Just the thought of it has him reconsidering his vow to retire after this season . <p> " I 'm not even thinking about double-teams right now , " he said . " Last year , I drew them constantly . This year , they 're going to have to contend with Perry and Jones . That 's going to set everything up for everybody else . " <p> Fletcher had seven sacks last season , his lowest total since 1987 . His projection for 1995 ? " At least 10 . " <p> It 's not just Fletcher and Williams , the Broncos ' other starting defensive end , who 'll benefit from the presence of so much beef in the middle of the line . The linebackers and defensive backs figure to play better , too . <p> If it 's a run play , Jones and Perry will occupy the middle of the offensive line , enabling linebackers to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force the quarterback to quickly unload the ball , giving the defensive backs a chance they did n't have in 1994 . <p> " It depends on who 's drawing the most attention , " Jones said . " The other guys have got to step up . There will be times when Michael Dean or Simon are going to make some plays , so they 're going to start concentrating on them more . That opens up the strong side to start making some plays . <p> " We 've also got corners who can cover man to man . That 's going to allow us to blitz our linebackers . You ca n't do that if your corners ca n't cover . So I think we 've got the personnel to come up with a lot of big plays . " <p> A year ago , the Broncos were the victims of a lot of big plays . Fact : The Denver defense allowed an astounding 67 plays of 20 or more yards , including 17 for touchdowns . Both figures ranked last in the league . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of quality interior linemen ? Consider this : One of Jones ' and Perry 's former Cleveland teammates , safety Eric Turner , led the league with nine interceptions last season , three fewer than the Broncos ' entire team . <p> " The name of the game is putting pressure on the passer , " Shanahan said . " It makes everybody better ; your linebackers , your secondary everybody . If you do n't get pressure , you set yourself up to give up big plays . " <p> Not that the 1995 Broncos wo n't give up big plays . Some of the faces are new , but their defense is only months removed from being the worst in the league . <p> " The good thing about this team is that we 've got players on the other side of the ball who can put points on the board , " Jones said . " That makes our job a lot easier . We might play well in 12 games . In those four or five games when we do n't play well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and find a way to win . "
