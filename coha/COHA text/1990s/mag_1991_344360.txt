Joseph Daniel Casolaro believed he was on to a big story . He also thought it might be a dangerous one . Just a few weeks ago , the free-lance writer told his family in Fairfax , Va. , that someone might try to kill him and make it look like an accident . On Aug. 10 he was found dead in a hotel room in Martinsburg , W. Va. , where he had gone to meet an unnamed source . There were slash marks around his wrists and a note near his body . It read in part , " I 'm sorry , especially to my son . " The official verdict : suicide . <P> Last week West Virginia authorities were taking a second look . Relatives and friends are insisting that Casolaro , 44 , might have been murdered in connection with a book he was writing . In recent months he had been looking into the eight-year legal battle between the Justice Department and Inslaw , Inc. , a computer software company based in Washington . Inslaw executives charge that Reagan Administration officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold it . Casolaro believed the Inslaw affair was just part of a much deeper tangle of intrigues that he called " the Octopus . " They included the Iran-contra arms deals and operations of the renegade bank B.C.C.I. <P> In addition to his claims of high-level conspiracy , Casolaro did research that put him on the trail of some dangerous characters . A key part of his investigations , for example , centered on gambling and attempted arms deals at the Cabezon Indian reservation near Indio , Calif . One figure in Casolaro 's proposed book would have been John Philip Nichols , a financial adviser to the Cabezons , who was sentenced to four years in prison in 1985 for attempting to hire a man to kill two people . <P> After a few hours of investigation into Casolaro 's death , local police took his body to a funeral parlor . The body was immediately embalmed  --  though police had not reached his family to get permission . That only heightened his family 's suspicions . " I do n't think Danny was depressed , " insists his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who says Casolaro was convinced that he had succeeded in tying the Inslaw case into " the Octopus . " " My sense was that he was very excited . " <P> But Casolaro may have had a motive for suicide . In recent months he had been badly in need of money and spoke of refinancing his house . Just before he died , his book proposal was rejected by Little , Brown , the New York City-based publisher that he considered his best hope for getting his work printed . Little , Brown publisher Roger Donald told the writer that his conspiracy notion was not sufficiently well supported by the evidence he advanced . <P> After Casolaro 's family raised questions , West Virginia authorities performed an autopsy , which found no signs on his body of a physical struggle . But because the body had been embalmed , pathologists may have had difficulty detecting any foreign substances in Casolaro 's blood . " We 're not ruling out foul play , " said Dr. James Frost , deputy medical examiner , " but I have no evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richardson , now an attorney for Inslaw , called last week for a federal probe of Casolaro 's death . Perhaps nothing less will put to rest the questions that surround it : Did Casolaro know too much about a shady operation ? Or did he know too much about himself ?
