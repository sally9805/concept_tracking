During 1997-1998 , my goal was to accelerate the work started by those who came before me . We have moved many of these important initiatives forward . <p> ASME International 's Focus on the Future planning initiative will provide long-term benefits to the Society . Last year , we documented the Society 's planning activities and focused on five broad themes : globalization of engineering , lifelong learning , technological pre-eminence , service to members and public service . Programs in these areas will strengthen ASME 's position as the premier engineering society in the world . I urge all of you to participate in this important ongoing process . <p> Volunteer and staff teamwork contributed to ASME 's success in such areas as the startup of Region XIII and the selection of ASME 's new headquarters location . We all worked together to help Codes and Standards in the redesign of the standards development process , implementing five pilot programs assisted by all units of the Society . The Industry-ASME Summit on Standards and Global Commerce brought together the Industry Advisory Board , ASME staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global economy on the Society 's codes and standards activities . We worked together to bring to ASME sections the first three 4-hour modules in the ASME Career Development Series . To promote pre-college math and science education , ASME produced publications for and participated in FIRST ( For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology ) high school robotics competitions as volunteers , organizers , team advisors and judges . And in recognition of its efforts to promote the participation of minorities in ASME and in mechanical engineering , the National Society of Black Engineers presented to ASME the first-ever Golden Torch Award in the category of Association Diversity . <p> Many of you shared your individual experiences in ASME 's Success Bank on ASMENET . Please continue to do so . Use it to recruit members and to give employers an appreciation of the value of ASME . An intangible but important benefit ASME offers is the " technical fellowship " that gives members the ability to share problems and solutions and their accompanying successes . <p> Through a combination of Humor , Action , Respect and Teamwork ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Thank you for your confidence and the opportunity to have served as the 116th president of ASME International . I hope you will continue to take HART in ASME and in each other . Sincerely , Keith B. Thayer President , 1997-1998 <p> <p> During the 1997-1998 fiscal year , ASME International took significant to expand service to members worldwide and continued its excellent financial performance . Some of the year 's highlights include the implementation of Region XIII to serve members outside North America . Its first Regional Administrative Conference was held in Singapore in September and subsequent meetings were held for subregions in Europe , the Middle East , the Pacific Rim , and Central and South America . ASME 's International Gas Turbine Institute held its second conference in the Far East , ASME ASIA ' 97 , in Singapore in the fall . In the spring , ASME participated in the International Congress of Mechanical Engineering Societies which convened in Athens , Greece . Additionally , ASMENET continued to set the pace for electronic communications among members around the world , growing to more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , significant staff resources were focused on the sale of the United Engineering Center and the leasing and renovation of new headquarters office space at Three Park Avenue in New York City . Architectural drawings were developed in January and February and construction began in March . Interior construction of the space is under way and a late summer move to the new location is planned . <p> In preparation for the move , ASME designed state-of-the-art computer facilities featuring fiber optic networking technology . New computers and network infrastructure will increase up to 15 times the speed at which employees access programs and data . Also , to prepare to move over 260 employees , and install their computers , ASME established a college intern program providing valuable learning experience to information systems students while benefiting from their hard work . <p> Another exciting achievement last year was the expansion of ASME 's internal wide area network ( WAN ) permitting instantaneous electronic communications between ASME locations . New capabilities that enhance service to members include a full-time , high-speed internet connection , file-sharing , anti-virus software updates , remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to internal e-mail , allowing employees to check for messages anywhere in the world where a web browser is available . <p> Even with the extra effort extended for the relocation , ASME staff endeavored to provide the high level of service members expect and deserve . This was an exciting and successful year for ASME International thanks to the hard work and team effort exerted by our volunteers and staff . Sincerely , David L. Belden Executive Director <p> ENGINEERING THE FUTURE <p> From the printed journal to the Society 's powerful , multi-featured Internet site , ASME continues to bring information on new technology to members around the world . In a period of rapid and oftentimes bewildering technological change , ASME finds one of its key roles is the dissemination of cutting-edge information that con tributes to the engineer 's day-today lifelong learning experience and the ability to influence future engineering accomplishments . Technologies of the Future <p> Meeting the need for cutting-edge technological information during the year , ASME organized a special symposium at the 1997 International Mechanical Engineering Congress &; Exposition on neural networks , remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing process . At that same conference , Daniel S. Goldin , chief of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , spoke about the development of new and advanced engineering design tools , which will transcend anything used before . He cited fully integrated and simulation-based design methodologies allowing total immersion into the inner workings of complex space systems . <p> Mechanical Engineering , the award-winning membership publication of the Society , is a key medium for the transfer of quality news and information on advanced technology . During the year , Mechanical Engineering featured articles on electrically-driven linear motors , which heighten the capabilities of assembly machines ; intelligent vehicles , trucks and cars equipped with laser-ranging sensors and video imaging systems for safety and improved navigation ; and fluid-structure interaction , an emerging finite element method , which experts believe will enhance mechanical and civil engineering designs . The magazine continued its on-line version , which in 1998 received the prestigious OZZIE award for quality and innovation . <p> Among other highlights of ASME 's world-renowned technical publishing activity , the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering became a bimonthly publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering in detecting disease and developing artificial joints and other body parts enabling people to restore health and live longer lives . <p> Future technology is also conveyed to members via professional development programs and division newsletters . A recent survey found 67 percent of the newsletters carry technical content along with news of elections and meetings in the division ; the publications of the Fluids Engineering , Heat Transfer , and Technology and Society Divisions devoted four or more pages to information on advanced science and engineering . Research and Technology Development <p> The ASME Center for Research and Technology Development ( CRTD ) in Washington , D.C. , provided opportunities for members to learn about new applications for technology . During the year , CRTD and its industrial partners began the project Expanded Use of High-Sulfur , Low-Fusion Coal in Utility Boilers . In addition , the investigation of a non-heat treatable type of aluminum for possible use in the exterior panels of automobiles neared the product development stage . <p> The Council on Codes and Standards , responding to the rapid pace of technological change in its constituent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . The council views the Internet as a key component of the redesign effort , and it selected the widely used B31.3 Chemical Piping Code as the pilot program for a beta Web-based collaborative authoring system . The development of codes and standards from the perspective of life-cycle management continues to be an ongoing activity . Public Policy <p> Activities by federal , state and local governments have a profound impact on technological development and the practice of engineering . Last year , members provided advice to governments through position papers and testimony before governmental bodies on issues such as research and development , energy policy , bioengineering and professional liability . <p> The ASME government relations home page on ASMENET was among the 10 most-visited directories on the website , averaging close to 1,000 user sessions weekly and transferring 10,000 pieces of information to users . A weekly electronic newsletter providing the latest information on government activities is now available to all members with an e-mail address . Future Engineers <p> Engineering practitioners are not the only beneficiaries of ASME 's programs . The Society is developing materials for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes and standards and how they are used . Through events like the Human-powered Vehicle Competition held in Region XII in May , the Society also brings technical challenges into the college classroom . There , students use computer-aided design methods to develop vehicles featuring structural integrity and positive aerodynamics . In addition to undergraduate and graduate college students , ASME also reaches groups ranging from girl scouts to secondary school students . BROADENING HORIZONS <p> Today 's engineers must compete in the world marketplace where technology , standards and education are changing rapidly . Through progressive programs and services , ASME informs , educates and enables its members to meet the challenges of this changing marketplace , workplace and environment . By broadening the Society 's services globally , ASME is more effectively meeting the needs of mechanical engineers worldwide through access to information , technology and professional contacts . Global Presence <p> Last year , ASME embraced the changing role of engineering through its many initiatives . Among these were the formation of Region XIII to serve members outside North America and the appointment of its first vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singapore during ASME ASIA ' 97 , the first conference jointly sponsored by several components of ASME : the International Gas Turbine Institute , the Petroleum , the Ocean Engineering , and the Advanced Energy Systems Divisions . <p> Subregions were identified , international members ' needs were assessed and the volunteer activity and leadership base was established . Subsequently , subregional meetings were held in Hong Kong , for the Pacific Rim ; Istanbul , for Europe and the Middle East ; and College Station , Texas , for Central and South America . <p> ASME 's involvement in conferences continues to expand globally . Of the 53 conferences managed by or involving ASME last year , 18 were held outside North America , compared to 13 in the preceding year . Global Outreach <p> ASME strengthened its outreach efforts to young people worldwide . Last year , 12 of 17 new student sections approved by the Board on Student Affairs were outside North America . The first Young Engineer 's Forum ( YEF ) in Asia was held in Tokyo , drew 96 registrants and was sponsored by ASME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metropolitan Institute of Technology . New sections in Australia and Turkey were approved . In addition , ASME conducted several continuing education programs outside North America , including Haiti , Hong Kong , Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , Slovenia , Spain , Venezuela and the West Indies . <p> The ASME-RAS ( Russian Academy of Sciences ) Partnership was completed in September . During the 2-year project sponsored by the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) more than 100 American and Russian engineers participated . A follow-up grant has helped equip participants with updated computers and facilities for videoconferencing , thus enhancing the quality of communications among the participants . <p> ASME began discussions with the Institute of Computational Modeling in Krasnoyarsk to develop a number of tutorials as on-line educational materials for graduate engineering students and practicing engineers in Russia . <p> ASME efforts continue to focus on global recognition and use of ASME codes and standards , Among the Society 's activities was an industry-ASME summit , held in Washington , D.C. , in April . Senior industry executives and government officials addressed issues relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy . <p> Members and staff of the nuclear codes and standards-setting units of ASME International and the Canadian Standards Association met in Toronto in October to discuss issues of mutual concern , including the future direction of the Canadian deuterium uranium reactor . <p> During the year , ASME added Qatar , Croatia and Liechtenstein to the list of countries where it accredits manufacturers , bringing the total to 60 . The number of international pressure equipment certificate holders increased by 10 percent and reached over 1,000 for the first time . International sales of codes and standards continue to run at approximately one-third of total sales revenue . <p> ASME met with the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Japan , which led to a formal acceptance of ASME codes and standards for Japan 's power industry . Global Influence <p> Since Oct. 1 , 1997 , companies that export boilers and pressure vessels to the People 's Republic of China must conform to the safety quality license requirements of the China Ministry of Labor . To inform those affected by this ruling , ASME held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manufacturers , " during the previous September in New York . It drew 150 people . Another demonstration of ASME 's global influence , the memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Labor of the People 's Republic of China , signed in February , was a first step in providing greater service to conformity assessment clients . <p> ASME played a significant role in the revitalization of ISO Technical Committee 11 on Boilers and Pressure Vessels , which is drafting an ISO standard for a performance-based approach to pressure equipment standards . This approach has received strong support from Australia , Japan , New Zealand and others . <p> In June , the Board of Governors approved an agreement of cooperation with the Ecuador Society , the 56th for ASME International . Last year , ASME signed agreements of cooperation with the Cyprus Mechanical Engineers Association , the Albanian Society of Mechanical Engineers and the South African Institution of Mechanical Engineers . <p> ASME participated in the Fifth International Congress of Mechanical Engineering Societies ( ICOMES ) in Athens , Greece . It drew more than 500 people from 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humanity 's most basic and precious gifts is communication . It allows us to share dreams , build relationships and shape the world . Today , the modes of communication have advanced far beyond our wildest imagination , and yet the essential mission has remained the same  --  to generate knowledge . Pioneering Association Communications <p> ASMENET , the Society 's site on the Worldwide Web , continued its tradition of excellence with the on-line addition of the Heat Transfer-Recent Contents and The Journal of Fluids Engineering . FE On-line is ASMENET 's first on-line course for the Review of Fundamentals of Engineering ( FE ) Exam . The on-line jobs database maintained its position as one of ASMENET 's most popular areas . ASMENET attracted more than 15,000 weekly user sessions last year . <p> ASME International continues to be a pioneer among professional societies in the use of cutting-edge communications technologies . An exciting achievement last year was the expansion of the internal Wide Area Network ( WAN ) to include all regional offices and the Petroleum Division . E-mail is now instantaneous between any of the eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-speed connection to the Internet , the ability to share files , to receive anti-virus software updates , to print remotely and to backup data . <p> ASME also expanded its range of electronic services and products . In cooperation with Stanford University and Yahoo ! , ASMENET successfully conducted its first live , interactive Webcast in September . Using the latest Web broadcast software , the Small Business Forum was available on-line , enabling viewers to participate by watching the live video stream and by e-mailing questions directly to the speakers . This communications event was the first of its kind for Stanford , Yahoo ! and ASME . <p> ASME 's Action Network Team and Capitol Update have increased the awareness and participation of members in the U.S. legislative process using the latest e-mail and Web-based technologies available . These programs reach over 3,000 members with information about the latest issues and trends in public policy affecting engineers . A key component of ASME 's communications activities is to inform its membership and the public about issues , such as research and development spending , the advancement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act and a wide variety of professional issues . Building Professional Skills <p> The ASME Career Development Series , a set of 4-hour short courses for delivery by sections , continued to grow . Three modules have been completed , and there are plans to expand the series to at least six modules . Eighteen new courses were added to the course inventory , and the total number of participants in ASME continuing education courses increased by 14.7 percent . The In-Company Training Program also continued to grow . An increase in requests for information about the program anti an overall rise in the number of programs offered helped In-Company Training increase its revenue by over 21 percent . <p> The ASME Transactions Journal continues to be a leading mechanical engineering resource , and the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering became ASME 's first bimonthly publication . Dozens of workshops were conducted for ASME members under the section leadership training program . Two of these included 1-day seminars for media relations activities conducted locally in Regions X and XII . <p> A total of 53 conferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broad range of technical and professional issues . In addition , 175 young engineers registered for a Young Engineers Forum at the 1997 International Mechanical Engineering Congress &; Exposition in Dallas , Texas . Reaching Out <p> The annual Middle School Math and Science Teachers ' Workshop had its highest attendance with 80 participants . The keynote presentation by Ringling Bros. and Barnum &; Bailey Circus , " Engineering at the Circus , " was particularly well received . Lesson plans and ideas for hands-on engineering classroom activities were also distributed to attendees . <p> Two studies were completed this year that focused on the changing face of engineering in general and ASME in particular . A study on the globalization of engineering practice provided insight on global trends and issues in engineering licensure and education . A study on potential barriers to the participation of women and minorities in ASME found no evidence of institutional barriers , but did identify some perceptual concerns . Specific recommendations were developed for ASME units to encourage inclusiveness for all mechanical engineers in the Society 's activities . <p> The Society 's media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-line . Of the 350 news releases the Society issued , 123 were posted on-line to Web-based journalism forums , up from 96 the previous year . The international media contact list has grown to nearly 900 contacts , up from 500 previously . Stories on ASME activities and members appeared in over 400 publications worldwide , including The New York Times , Scientific American and Design News . PARTNERING FOR PROGRESS <p> Whether the purpose was to inform various entities about issues important to the engineering community or to encourage interest in math and science learning among pre-college students , last year ASME worked with public officials and educators , industry leaders and youth groups to increase public awareness and understanding of engineering among people of all ages , disciplines and origins . Partnerships <p> ASME initiated a new partnership with the Boy Scouts and strengthened its partnerships with two other key organizations that work with young people , Girl Scouts USA and FIRST ( For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology ) . For Engineers Week in February , profiles of ASME women-member engineers were posted on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . The Girl Scouts also posted on-line selected footage of the ASME-produced video , Mothers of Invention , and promoted it with a special ASME-Girl Scouts video purchase price . <p> ASME 's involvement with the FIRST Foundation 's annual robotics competition for high school students saw an increase in the number of ASME members who volunteered to judge the regional and national events and who served as team advisors . In addition , the Society published the ASME Guide to Starting a FIRST Team , sponsored a How to Start a FIRST Team Workshop and co-sponsored the Capitol Hill invitational : Havoc on the Hill exhibition tournament to highlight for members of Congress the importance of math and science literacy among high school students . <p> Throughout the fall , ASME worked with the National Building Museum in Washington , D.C. , and the Engineers Week organization to provide resources for the exhibit , Breaking Through : The Creative Engineer , which opened during Engineers Week in February . The exhibit now will tour the nation 's science centers . In addition , ASME is leading the Engineers Week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Postal Service . <p> Partnerships also included ASME collaborations with other engineering societies in the development of Web sites that interactively encourage the gathering of recent history in specified areas of engineering . ASME joined with the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the American Society of Civil Engineers ( ASCE ) in this 2-year , 2-topic experimental project . In addition , ASME worked with the National Parks Service and ASCE to develop a 1-day workshop to advance the understanding and appreciation of the history of engineering . Public Policy <p> ASME was a leader in a coalition of over 100 engineering and scientific societies in promoting increased federal funding of research . With other engineering and scientific societies , ASME members participated in a Congressional Visits Day in Washington during Engineers Week and in a pilot program of visits with members of Congress in their district offices during the spring congressional recess . ASME continued to actively collaborate with other engineering societies to speak with a unified voice on cross-cutting issues for the engineering profession through the American Association of Engineering Societies . Achievements <p> Two new Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was upgraded from a division ( Bioengineering ) award and the Daniel C. Drucker Award was established for Applied Mechanics . Dr. Drucker , a graduate research professor emeritus at the University of Florida in Gainesville , was the first recipient of the medal that was named in his honor . <p> On the receiving end , ASME was cited for three outreach programs providing career guidance , knowledge and education . ASME 's Accessing Technology Briefings , Young Engineers Forum and Leadership Development Initiative were elected to the 1997 Associations Advance America Honor Roll of the American Society of Association Executives . The programs were cited as " examples of how associations play a vital role in helping the nation adapt to complex and changing times . " <p> ASME International also was honored by the National Society of Black Engineers ( NSBE ) for promoting the participation of minorities in ASME and in mechanical engineering . For its benchmark achievements , ASME was awarded NSBE 's first-ever Golden Torch Award in the category of Association Diversity . <p> Individual member recognition was given to ASME Executive Director David L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the American Association of Engineering Societies for his efforts to promote cooperation , understanding and unity among professional engineering societies . <p> And , as part of its ongoing program to recognize important mechanical engineering achievements , last year ASME designated five mechanical engineering historical landmarks the Kew Bridge Cornish steam engines in London , the Bay Area Rapid Transit in California , the Bessemer conversion engine in Michigan , the David Taylor Model Basin in Maryland and the General Electric diamond maker in upstate New York . <p> These efforts reflect the numerous ways in which ASME International partnered last year with other engineering societies , industry , government , educational institutions and other organizations to work toward common goals .

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Accounting <p> The financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting . Basis of Presentation <p> The Society 's net assets anti revenue , expenses , gains and losses are classified based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions . Accordingly , the net assets of the Society and changes therein are classified and reported as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not subject to donor-imposed stipulations . <p> Temporarily restricted net assets . Net assets subject to donor-imposed stipulations that will be met either by actions of the Society and/or the passage of time . <p> Permanently restricted net assets . Net assets subject to donor-imposed stipulations that they be maintained permanently by the Society . Generally , the donors of these assets permit the Society to use all or part of the income earned on related investments for general or specific purposes . <p> Revenues are reported as increases in unrestricted net assets unless their use is limited by donor-imposed restrictions . Expenses are reported as decreases in unrestricted net assets . Gains and losses on investments and other assets or liabilities are reported as increases or decreases in unrestricted net assets unless their use is restricted by explicit donor stipulation or by law . Expirations of temporary restrictions on net assets ( i.e .. the donor-stipulated purpose has been fulfilled and/or the stipulated time period has elapsed ) are reported as reclassifications between the applicable classes of net assets . Revenue and Expenses <p> The Society 's revenue and expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principally of the following : <p> Council on Member Affairs . Revenue includes member dues recognized over the applicable membership period . Expenses relate to membership activities , as well as membership standards , grades , recruitment and retention . <p> Council on Education .
