When thousandths of a second can mean tens of thousands of dollars in prize money , you better have the right time . Photograph Photograph // From the outside , it looks like an ordinary little log cabin perched on the side of a mountain . Inside , crammed into that plain 10 x 20-ft. building , are enough wiring , laptops , photocells and communications equipment to run a small country-plus the people to do it . This is the timing center for the World Alpine Ski Championships on Vail Mountain in Colorado . And trying to get into the timekeeping center to talk to Jean Campiche , manager of TAG Heuer 's timing operations worldwide , and Ted Savage , senior ski timing engineer , is like trying to get an interview with Mark McGwire during the All-Star Game . You pretty much take it for granted when you watch sporting events on television . The competitive times will be there for you in the lower right part of your screen . And they 'll be accurate . But how do they get there ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And how do you really know the times they display are accurate ? Photograph Clockwise from top left Technicians keep an eye on the timing data at the Air Canada Grand Prix . Cylindrical sensors used along the pit lane and starting grid detect excessive speeds and false starts . Antennas embedded in the track identify the signals emitted by the rectangular transponder on each car , and transmit them to the timing center in The Village . // We wanted to know , too . In our quest for the truth , we started out in Vail and ended up in Montreal , focusing on two of the fastest , most technically challenging-and **27;586;TOOLONG we could find : World Championship skiing and Formula One auto racing . We enlisted the aid of TAG Heuer , the 140-year-old Swiss watchmaker and the official timekeeping organization for both events . The company gave us complete access to its staff and facilities at both locations , albeit with some concerns for security . These days timekeeping is n't just keeping time anymore . It also includes providing an expansive array of graphics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One , this means using computers to automatically build and generate timekeeping graphics , and timing to a more precise level than what 's released to competitors and the public . Those sponsor logos , time comparisons , sector times , running times and fastest lap statistics that appear onscreen during a Grand Prix or World Championship ski race are automatically generated by TAG Heuer 's timing system within .2 second of being recorded . The goal is simple , says Savage : " When the whole world is watching , it has to be right . " Computers , software and a single time base system are the keys to accurate timing for all of TAG Heuer 's systems . Its philosophy of timing sets the company apart : The fairest , most accurate way to time is to use one timing base for everyone . " It means that every impulse that is received from the start , the intermediate and the finish are given on the same timing system . And today , we are alone in doing that , " says Campiche . Other companies may use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another for the finish or individual times . To help ensure accuracy , everything in the timing system is backed up . So the timekeepers use two clocks , two servers , backup wiring , etc . How do they get one timing base even though they use two clocks ? By running the two clocks with the exact same quartz frequency so they are precisely synchronized , that 's how . The engineers start the clocks before the race and leave them running until after the entire event stops . Nature 's Challenge Steep slopes , harsh weather conditions and course traffic pose challenges unique to timing ski races . Plus , there are limits to the kind of equipment you can drag up a mountain . The timing photocells have to work down to - 22 F , transmit a beam up to 200 meters and be sensitive enough to pick up a skier traveling at 80 mph , yet not be triggered by falling snow . Times are given to boo second in ski racing , as required by world skiing competition 's sanctioning body , the International Ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra decimal place-ow second-to ensure accuracy . The extra data is never released . In the men 's super G at Vail last February , two gold medals were awarded for first place even though TAG Heuer had the data in its computers to break the tie .

Infrared photocells sense skiers and transmit data to the timing center . Matrix displays show rankings , graphics and timing information during races . Single-line display at the finish gives skiers instant results . // The timing equipment consists of the mechanical start gate and infrared photocells along the course and at the finish line . All of this equipment is wired directly to the timing center and assigned a channel identification number in the timing system . Before the race starts , the technicians enter the bib numbers of each competitor into the computer in the order they will compete , set the clock in the timing center to the official time of day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racer leaves the start gate , an impulse travels down the hill to the timing center , and into the impulse distributor , which sends it simultaneously to systems A and B. The system records the TOD , the skier 's number and the channel number assigned to the start location . This data is output to small , calculator-size printers . " From the time the start gate opens , every time a photocell triggers the times are transmitted and recorded directly on the hard copy , so if anything goes wrong , we have the evidence here , " says Savage . The printouts are reviewed by an independent auditor . Photocells placed at knee-height along the course , called intermediate points , and at the finish line , transmit a 2mm infrared beam from a transmitter on one side of the course to a receiver on the other . When the beam is broken , an impulse goes to the timing center and is recorded in TOD . At one of the intermediate points , two sets of photocells are set up , about 20 meters apart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks the infrared beam at the finish line , the system calculates the split time by subtracting the start TOD from the finish TOD . In Vail , TAG Heuer used " dynamic graphics " software it developed specifically for the World Alpine Ski Championships to provide more data , faster . The graphics show the skier 's name along with his ranking , running time and the other information that appears on the scoreboards and on TV . The computers in the timing center crunch the numbers , interpret the data and automatically generate the timing graphics . All of this information is fed from the hill to the timing center , processed and displayed within two-tenths of a second . The backup wiring , clocks , photocells , and a computer system running simultaneously automatically take over if the primary system fails . But what if everything fails ? TAG Heuer has people standing at the start and finish line recording start and finish times with good old reliable stopwatches-in running time , of course . They start their watches when the race starts and keep them running until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though we 're with Campiche , trying to get past security and into the gigantic transportable building called The Village is perhaps more difficult than gaining entry to the top-secret Lawrence Livermore Labs . The Village is the nerve center for the timing and television operations for the Canadian Grand Prix . And as in Vail , they do n't let just anybody in . The same center is transported and set up at every Grand Prix . It 's where all the timing data from the track is received , and analyzed to produce those split-second statistics we 're so used to seeing when we watch an auto race on TV . Technology for timing and scoring motorsports events has been revolutionized since the days when each pit had a person manually timing and scoring with a stopwatch . Today 's technology has no problem recording lap times to Voon second in Formula One events , though you 're given times " only " to ooo second when you 're watching an event . Up until four years ago , the official timekeeping system for Formula One relied on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , 200-gram transponder is located underneath each car , below the skidplate and behind a wheel . Better technology and the move of the transponders underneath the cars improved the system 's accuracy so much that photocells are now used only at the finish line as a second backup system . TAG Heuer ships the transponders to each team before they start winter practice sessions , along with a diagram showing exactly where the transponder must be placed . Antennas embedded in the track detect the signal from the transponder on each car as it passes over and transmit this data to the computers in the timing center , where it is analyzed , packaged for television and distributed to the teams and monitors around the track . The antennas are simple cables installed at right angles to the direction of travel of the cars . They cover the width of the track at each timing point . To calculate speed , two antennas are installed 30 meters apart at each of the three timing points along the track , plus the speed trap . " The first antenna of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one gives us the speed , " says Campiche . Based on the time it takes the car to travel the 30 meters , the computers in the timing center calculate statistics including lap time , best lap , gap , and " real time " speed and distribute it to the displays , teams and television in less than .2 second . Eight antennas along the track capture timing data . Eleven sensors along pit lane are used to enforce the reduced speed limit there . Another 22 sensors along the starting grid detect false starts . Timekeeping has to be able to keep up with improving race technology . TAG Heuer has also been adding new services each year . In 1999 , for instance , it added top speed readouts by putting a fourth antenna detection point at some races . The teams use the timing information , such as sector times and lap times , to determine race strategy . And thousandths of a second make all the difference . In Montreal , Michael Schumacher ( Ferrari ) gained the pole position over Mika Hakkinen ( McLaren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ferrari ) clocked the fastest speed , 185.1 mph , during qualifying . Irvine also logged the fastest lap time during the race-1:20.382-at a speed of 122.957 mph . Try doing that with a stopwatch . TAG Heuer 's system builds the timing graphics for the television broadcast . So when the director wants to go to Michael Schumacher , he gives the TAG Heuer technician a few seconds ' advance notice . " Schumacher in five ! " he 'll call out . The technician prepares the graphic . The director calls , " Take Schumacher ! " And when the viewers at home see Schumacher 's car on their TVs , the timing stats are there , too . TAG Heuer estimates that it spends $15 million a year on all its timekeeping efforts . It handles timekeeping for only three sports : Formula One , World Alpine skiing and the America 's Cup yacht races . " In this business , if you want to have an impact , you have to be focused , " says Christian Viros , chairman of TAG Heuer . From over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquitoes flying into a bullhorn , slicing through the tranquil , sunny blue skies . In seconds , a blur goes by , and the Doppler effect makes the sound fade to merely a whine . It 's just a typical Formula One car traveling 190 mph here at Gilles Villeneuve track . The time and speed flash onto the screen . Yes , you can be sure they 're accurate .
