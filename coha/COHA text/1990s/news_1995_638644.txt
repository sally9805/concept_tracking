<p> COLORADO SPRINGS - The right hand once fit neatly inside a baseball glove . Now the glove lies unnoticed on a bookshelf by the wall . And Dave Dravecky 's only hand grips a leather-bound copy of the Bible . <p> Judgment day used to arrive once around the rotation , when Dravecky went to battle for the glory of God and the San Francisco Giants . The verdict was absolute - win , loss or no-decision - and chronicled in the box score for all the world to see . <p> Dravecky still loves the game the way he loved it as a boy in Youngstown , Ohio . His heart raced every evening when his father , a machinist , walked through the door caked in grease and smelling of perspiration . As the sun drifted over the horizon , father and son would celebrate their bond with a game of catch . <p> But the concept of baseball-as-mystical experience seems quaintly obsolete these days . A world exists beyond those chalk lines . It 's a world filled with people in distress , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible aloft . His green eyes brim with passion . He has endured a lot of pain and emerged from his travails a better man , with a greater sense of purpose . <p> He articulates his viewpoint with Elmer Gantry fervor . His voice rises like a river , swelling and cresting toward its banks . " When you look around this world , it 's hurting , " Dravecky says . " People are struggling with relationships . They 're struggling with families . They 're struggling every day just to make a living . All kinds of people out there are in tremendous pain . <p> " I think the church has failed to meet these people where they are . There 's an expectation on the church 's part , ' Get fixed up first , then come to us . ' I 've lived with that attitude , too , so I 'm not perfect . <p> " But I 've realized through my own pain and suffering how valuable it is for someone to come alongside Dave Dravecky and say , ' I care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to stay with you every step of the way . " ' <p> He runs a ministry - Dave Dravecky 's Outreach of Hope - but he is not an ordained minister . He calls himself a professional en- <p> courager . Cancer patients and amputees are his specialty . <p> Dravecky and his four full-time employees work out of an unassuming little office in a shopping plaza with a travel agency , pizza parlor and Loaf ' N Jug convenience store . They provide comfort to cancer sufferers by phone , through letters and a magazine called " The Encourager . " <p> The walls in the office lobby are adorned with memorabilia from Dravecky 's playing career . A game ball here . A commemorative quilt there . The plaque for winning the 1994 Ernie Davis Courage Award . <p> Dravecky 's business card features a silhouette of a baseball pitcher with left arm extended . That seems odd , considering doctors amputated Dravecky 's left arm four years ago . The arm helped him win 64 major-league games . Now he 's left with phantom pain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive omens in setbacks . Where others might say , " Why me ? " he considers himself blessed . He has a chance to help millions because he once had a flair for throwing a baseball . <p> " My identity was found in that left arm , " Dravecky says , " just like a pianist 's hands or a ballerina 's legs . That identity was very strong for me , and all of a sudden I lost it . But in losing it , I gained another identity that 's much more important than baseball . <p> " Baseball was the tool , the vehicle , that gave me exposure to be in the position I 'm in today . I look back now and I can begin to see how things fit . The Cinderella story does n't always come true . But it does n't have to come true for good to still happen . " <p> Two performances will forever define Dave Dravecky in the national sporting consciousness . <p> The first came Aug. 10 , 1989 . A mere 10 months after having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dravecky pitched seven one-hit innings in a 4-3 victory over Cincinnati at Candlestick Park . <p> Former Giants manager Roger Craig , who witnessed Don Larsen 's perfect game in 1956 , said Dravecky 's performance was more dramatic . The fans gave Dravecky a standing ovation in the bullpen before the game , and the lovefest never ceased . Dravecky could feel the warmth radiating from the stands . He was n't alone . <p> Terry Kennedy , the Giants ' starting catcher in the comeback game , remembers seeing 50 writers and photographers lined up near the bullpen as Dravecky got loose . <p> " I played in a World Series and in All-Star Games , and this ranked right up there , " says Kennedy , now a coach with the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers . " I probably wanted to win that game more than any of them , just because of what Dave had been through . <p> " It was pretty amazing . I think Steve Bedrosian was the most nervous person in the park that day , because he had to come in at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later in Montreal , the glass slipper shattered in a million pieces . Dravecky wound up to throw a fastball to Tim Raines and heard a crack above his ear . It sounded like a tree branch snapping . He fell to the mound in a heap , and teammate Will Clark , eyes wide with fear , sprinted to his side to offer assistance . <p> After the game , the San Francisco players were in shock . Dravecky remembers Montreal catcher Mike Fitzgerald , a close friend , breaking the silence with a consoling word . Fitzgerald embraced Dravecky , whispered " I love you " in his ear , and left the clubhouse in tears . <p> Dravecky , oddly enough , took the setback as a personal challenge . What did God possibly have in store for him ? After the Cincinnati game , he had received congratulatory letters from as far away as Australia and Japan . What could those people be thinking now ? <p> " Here I 'm on an incredible high with this victory , " Dravecky says . " All eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom - I fall . I 'm lying there with a broken arm and I 'm thinking ' This is not coincidence . Something incredible is about to happen in my life . " ' <p> Dravecky never realized how much suffering he would endure . He broke his arm a second time in the celebration after the Giants beat Chicago for the 1989 National League pennant . His wife , Jan , lost her father to a massive heart attack . Husband and wife , overwhelmed by 10,000 pieces of mail , drifted in and out of depression . And Dravecky 's left arm , his professional pride and joy , became a source of heartache and distress . <p> As time passed , it hurt Dravecky to lift a fork to his mouth or play with his children . He underwent radiation therapy and two more operations to remove cancer cells from the arm . But it continued to degenerate into a horrible , mangled burden . <p> When doctors at the Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York told Dravecky he might lose the arm , he felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father expressed a similar sentiment . <p> " I 'm sick and tired of seeing you dragging around that arm , " Frank Dravecky said . " I want them to take it off , so you can get on with the rest of your life . " <p> In his second book , " When You Ca n't Come Back , " Dravecky recalls the strange sensation of looking in the mirror and seeing his left arm and shoulder gone . Like a child , he had to re-learn the most rudimentary skills with his right hand . A task as simple as buttoning a shirt or tying a tie suddenly was an ordeal . <p> But nothing compared to the emotional trauma . Dravecky put up a brave front , giving motivational speeches to groups from coast-to-coast . But away from the crowds , his world was crumbling . He suffered cluster headaches so severe , he once wrapped his head in a pillow and banged it against the wall for relief . <p> Reality hit one day after a long road trip . <p> " I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw , " he says . " My arm was gone . My career was over . I was exhausted . I was overwhelmed . I really did n't care to go out and talk to people and encourage them . I was basically on my own little pity party . <p> " I laid on the bed and my wife asked me , ' What 's wrong with you ? ' I told her , ' Honey , how can you love me ? I 'm not even a whole man anymore . ' At that point , I realized I had hit rock-bottom . I had lost my identity . It was all wrapped up in baseball . " <p> Time , Christian faith and the love of friends helped pull the Draveckys through their struggle . But the fallout from Dravecky 's ordeal will remain with him until the day he dies . <p> He is haunted by phantom pain every waking hour . God graces him with eight hours of sleep at night . The rest of the time , he 's on his own . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my left arm , " he says . " It was in a sling , so my arm rests in a sling as we speak . I can not get relief from that position . <p> " I actually feel as if I have this plastic cast around my hand . And they 're blowing it up , and they never stop blowing it up . So there 's an intense pressure around my fingers and my hand . It 's like being in a pressure cooker and it wants to pop . But it never pops . " <p> Dravecky became a born-again Christian in Amarillo , Texas , in the summer of 1981 , in response to a personal challenge from a teammate . <p> " In reading the Bible , I came to realize just how precious this gift is that God has given us through Jesus Christ , " he says . <p> In major-league stops with San Diego and San Francisco , he never encountered much resistance to his faith from his teammates . Indeed , his closest friends - Scott Garrelts , Mark Thurmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beliefs . <p> Dravecky is keenly aware that Christianity makes some people in the baseball establishment squirm . In his comeback from cancer , he made no secret of his religious convictions . One writer accused him of putting Christianity on a billboard . <p> Dravecky makes no apologies for his conduct . In his mind , he was simply being honest . <p> " There 's an element of this game that says you have to be a certain way - otherwise you ca n't be successful , " he says . " Why do n't you go out and pound a couple of six-packs and get sloshed ? That 's how you 're supposed to prove you 're a man and an athlete . Well , I 'm sorry , but to me that 's not an athlete . <p> " It takes more of a man to refrain from getting in a fight than to fight . It takes more of a man to hold back when that anger is boiling up inside , and not throw that bat or that helmet or cuss . I know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go between the lines and hurt somebody just to prove I was n't a wimp . " <p> Dravecky intentionally hit a batter once in his career . Under orders from the manager , he drilled Philadelphia 's Len Matuszek in the rump with a fastball . He reflects upon the incident with a sense of revulsion . In hindsight , he would have pitched to Matuszek and lived with the inevitable disapproving glances in the clubhouse . <p> For what it 's worth , Dravecky 's fellow ballplayers never saw his soft side on the mound . They saw a craftsman . For years , Bob Brenly thought Dravecky had six pitches in his repertoire . Then the two became teammates in San Francisco , and Brenly discovered Dravecky threw only two pitches - a fastball and a slider . It just seemed like six , because he used them so deftly . <p> " Whether it 's right or wrong , a lot of Christian athletes have a rap as nonaggressive , " says Brenly , now a broadcaster with the Giants . " But Dave was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he felt they were leaning out . There was nothing malicious about it . He just knew he had to pitch that way to be successful . " <p> Resourcefulness was always a strong point for Dravecky . He never forgot he was a 21st-round draft pick from a community known more for producing football players than baseball stars . He took pride in the image of the small-town boy who succeeded with smarts and determination . <p> Here 's the irony : The more Dravecky grew as a person after baseball , the clearer it became that he no longer belonged in his hometown of Youngstown . <p> " We had some wonderful friends , and my whole family is back there , " he says . " The only problem was , we were being smothered in Youngstown . There was very little privacy . You live in a town of 45,000 and you 're the only guy who 's gotten to the big leagues for more than a cup of coffee , and everybody knows who you are . " <p> Two years ago July , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outset , they found life in Colorado as refreshing as a mountain view . Dave fell in love with skiing , and every now and then , when his schedule permits , he will take his golf clubs out of the basement . He shoots between 105 and 120 , one-handed . <p> Dravecky 's travel schedule is hectic . He made 50 trips in 1994 before cutting back to 26 this year . He wants to spend more time with his family and devote more time to his ministry . <p> He remains a popular speaker . In July he traveled to Philadelphia to speak to AMBUCS , a service club that creates independence for people with disabilities . It 's an understatement to say he made an impression . <p> " On a scale of 1 to 10 , he was an 11 , " says Alan Pearson , AMBUCS national vice president . " A lot of times you 'll bring in a speaker and they 'll have a canned presentation . But Dave was really prepared . He dovetailed what he wanted to do with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at our convention , too , and he was very good . The difference with Dave is , his disability is right there for everyone to see . That just made his message more dramatic . " <p> Dravecky feels equally ill-at-ease with pity or hero worship . He does n't profess to be perfect . On the contrary , he revels in his imperfections . <p> " There are days when I stumble , " he says . " There are days when I struggle with my wife . There are days when I scream and holler at my kids for no reason . I make mistakes . I fall . But I know the direction I 'm going in . " <p> He talks about living his life as a disciple of Jesus . Be humble , he urges . Be a servant . Esteem others greater than yourself . <p> His purpose is n't to beat people over the head with the Bible . Whether he is walking a hospital cancer ward , speaking from a podium or consoling a cancer patient by phone , he is consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this Bible to embrace people and love them , " he says . " My intention is to take God 's work and say , ' Look , we care about you . In the process , we want you to see God 's love through us . " ' <p> In his transition from pitcher to preacher , Dave Dravecky has come full circle . He has emerged , in every sense of the word , whole .
