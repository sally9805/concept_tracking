Making the most of these unique containers <p> EVER SINCE the Hanging Gardens of Babylon won recognition as one of the Seven Wonders of the World , gardeners have been trying to extend their growing space by planting vertically . And the strawberry jar represents vertical planting at its finest . Plants are tucked in the side pockets of a tall , stout container and encouraged to cascade downward . Not only can you achieve impressive yields in a minimal amount of space , but the finished result looks absolutely luxuriant . <p> Although strawberries might have provided the inspiration for these unusual terra-cotta pots , they are not the only plants suitable for this method of growing . Almost any trailing plant will be equally content , as long as it can endure the rigors of outdoor life and has the same water and sun requirements as its pot mates . Herbs such as thyme , oregano , yerba buena , and savory are often enlisted for the job . They look handsome falling over the edges of the clay , and the culinary yield can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light is essential for a successful strawberry jar . A sunny patio or deck with balanced light from all directions is ideal . Even then , it is wise to rotate the jar regularly to expose all of the pockets equally . Besides taking up residence on patios or decks , strawberry jars can sit proudly by the front door and on top of walls , or act as the focal point of a border or garden . If properly planted and cared for , they quickly become a masterpiece in progress . <p> Presumably the first strawberry jars were born in the sun-drenched Mediterranean area , with cracked water vessels enlisted for the purpose . Although the traditional strawberry jar still looks like the tall , lean vessels that sparked the idea , there are now all sorts of variations on the theme . The best designs for planting purposes have two stories of little walled balconies jutting out from their sides and drainage holes in the bottom . ( Jars that simply have holes cut in the sides must be planted and watered carefully to prevent plants and soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two levels of pockets , it is helpful to run a one-inch-in-diameter PVC pipe with holes cut at each story down the center of the pot to facilitate the even distribution of water to all occupants . <p> To care for your strawberry jar , water each pocket separately , wetting the sides of the pot as you go to prevent the clay from wicking moisture away from the soil . Check frequently for signs of wilting , and apply a balanced fertilizer every two to three weeks . You may need to trim enthusiastic plants occasionally to prevent the pot from becoming a tangle . Because the plants are difficult to over-winter indoors , strawberry jars tend to be strictly summertime entertainment in colder climates . Just empty and store the pots when light levels start to get low in the fall , and take the winter to plan what to plant in your jar next year . <p> For sources of strawberry jars , check your local garden center or nursery . <p> PHOTO : Gardening scene <p> PHOTO : 1 .

Once the lowest tier is planted , continue to fill the jar until the soil is even with the next level of balconies . Slip more plants into the pockets and firm them in place . If there are additional levels , continue to plant by the same method . If a plant does n't fit in a pocket , choose a smaller plant or tease out its roots to loosen the root ball . <p> PHOTO : 3 .

After the plants are comfortably in place , give the jar a generous watering , starting from the top and proceeding to each of the pockets . Set the jar in partial shade for a few days to allow the plants to become established . Then gradually move the jar to its permanent , sunny location and fertilize every two to three weeks with a balanced fertilizer . <p> PHOTOS ( 3 ) : Left : With their cascading runners , strawberries are one of the most obvious ( and delicious ) choices for planting in a strawberry jar . You can also mix them with other plants , such as sedums ( bottom , right ) , or devote the container to a colorful mix of sunloving herbs ( bottom , left ) . The options are endless , but as a rule , trailing plants look best in the side pockets , topped by a plant with a more upright habit .
