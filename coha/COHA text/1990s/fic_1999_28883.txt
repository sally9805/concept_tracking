Kenny Traveler was lazy . That explained why he 'd fallen asleep in TWA 's Ambassador Club at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport instead of promptly meeting British Airways Flight 2193 at the gate . Pure laziness , plus the fact that he did n't want to meet Flight 2193 . Unfortunately , the entrance of a noisy pair of businessmen awakened him . He took his time stretching , then yawned for a while . A nice-looking woman in a short gray suit smiled at him , and he smiled back . He glanced at his watch and saw he was half an hour late . He yawned again . Stretched . " Excuse me , " the woman said . " I 'm sorry to bother you , but ... you look so familiar . Are n't you " " Yes , ma'am , I am . " He tilted his Stetson and gave her a grin that still had a little yawn clinging to the edges . " And I 'm flattered you recognize me outside the rodeo ring . Most people do n't . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you were ... You look so much like Kenny Traveler , the pro golfer . " " Golfer ? Me ? Oh , no , ma'am . I 'm way too young to play an old man 's game like golf . I like real sports . " " But " " Rodeo . Now that 's a real sport . Football , too , and basketball . " He slowly unfolded all six feet two inches of himself from the chair . " When it comes to tennis , though , that 's when things start getting iffy . And golf is n't something a real man wants to get too close to . " The gray suit had n't been born yesterday , and she smiled . " Still , I seem to remember watching you win the AT &T; and theBuick Invitational on TV this winter . I swear I thought Tiger was going to break into tears during that last round at Torrey Pines . " Her smile faded . " I still ca n't believe that Commissioner Beau " " I 'd appreciate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Antichrist in front of me . " " Sorry . How long do you think your suspension 'll last ? " Kenny glanced down at his gold Rolex . " I guess that might depend on how long it takes me to get to British Airways ? " " Pardon ? " " Real nice talkin ' to you , ma'am . " He tipped his Stetson and ambled from the lounge . One of his unhappy ex-girlfriends had pointed out that Kenny 's amble was really the closest thing he had to a full-out run . But Kenny 'd never seen much point in wasting energy anyplace but on the golf course . He liked to take things slow and easy , although lately that had been tough . He ambled past the newsstand , refusing to look at the newspapers that were carrying the story of his recent suspension by acting PGA Commissioner Dallas Fremont Beaudine , a suspension that was taking place in the middle of the hottest winning streak in the history of professional golf and was going to keep him from playing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenny . " He nodded toward a businessman who had that over-eager expression people frequently wore when they spotted his semi-famous face . He could tell the man was from the north because he said his name all-proper instead of pronouncing it " Kinny " like God 's people did . He kicked up his amble half a notch just in case the businessman took it in his head to relive Kenny 's triumphant final round at Bay Hill last month . A big-haired , tight-jeaned woman gave him the twice-over , but she did n't look like a PGA fan , so Kenny figured it was his good looks had attracted her . A former girlfriend had said that , if Hollywood ever made a movie of Kenny 's life , the only star pretty enough to play him on the screen was Pierce Brosnan . That had sent Kenny right through the roof . Not because she 'd called him pretty , which he could sort of understand , but her casting choice . He 'd told her right then that the only way he 'd ever let Pierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got rid of that prissy foreign accent , then fed him enough chicken-fried steak so he did n't look like the first storm out of West Texas would blow him over . But most of all , they 'd have to teach old Pierce exactly how God intended for a man to swing a golf club . All the walking was making him tired . He stopped to rest at a cart selling nuts and candy , bought himself some Jelly Bellys , flirted just enough with the Mexican cutie working there to convince her to pull out the banana-flavored ones . Although he liked his Jelly Bellys mixed up , he did n't like the banana , but , since it took too much effort to pull them out himself , he generally tried to talk someone else into doing it . If that did n't work , he just ate ' em . The British Airways gate was deserted , so he leaned against one of the support columns , pulled a handful of Jelly Bellys from the bag , and tilted them into his mouth while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wring the neck of a certain Francesca Serritella Day Beaudine , celebrity wife of the Antichrist acting PGA commissioner , and a woman who was supposed to be his friend . " Just do this one small favor for me , Kenny , " she 'd said . " If you 'll take care of Emma for the next two weeks , I guarantee I 'll talk Dallie into cutting the length of your suspension . You 'll miss the Masters , but " " Now , how are you gon na do that ? " he 'd inquired . " Never question my methods when it comes to dealing with my husband . " He did n't . Everybody knew that Francesa did n't have to do much more than look at Dallie Beaudine to melt him down , even though they 'd been married for twelve years . A high-pitched child 's squeal , followed by a cheerful British voice , distracted him . " Do let go of your sister 's hair , Reggie , or I shall be quite cross with you . And there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't licked him , he would n't have hit you . " He turned around , then grinned as he saw a woman barreling around the corner with two young children in tow . The first thing he noticed was her hat , a perky little straw number with a turned-up brim and a cluster of cherries bobbing at the center . She wore a gauzy green skirt printed with roses and a loose-fitting rose-colored top that matched a pair of trim little flats . In one hand she clutched a young boy , along with a purse the size of Montana . In the other hand , she held a mean-faced little girl , an umbrella that was printed with more flowers , and a raspberry-red tote bag bulging with newspapers , books , and another colorful umbrella . Her light brown hair curled this way and that from beneath the brim of her hat , and whatever makeup she 'd started out the day with had long ago worn off . Which was probably a good thing , Kenny decided , because even without lipstick , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wide , with a plump bottom lip , and a top lip that held a distinct bow at the center . Despite her frivolous clothing , her jaw was firm . But her cheeks were baby doll round , the bones fine . Her nose was a little narrow , but not narrow enough to make him lose interest , because she also had an amazing pair of thick-lashed golden brown eyes . He mentally redressed her in a tight top , short skirt , and a pair of stiletto heels , then added black fishnet stockings for good measure . He 'd never paid for sex in his life , but he decided he 'd be more than happy to throw a little extra cash her way if she ever decided she needed to earn something on the side to pay for her kids ' orthodontics work . To his surprise , she looked over at him . " Mr. Traveler ? " Fantasy was one thing , reality another , and as he gazed from her to the noisy kids , he got a sinking sensation in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him indicated this could only be Lady Emma Wells-Finch , the woman Kenny had agreed to baby-sit for the next two weeks . But Francesca had n't mentioned anything about kids . He realized too late that he 'd automatically nodded in response to her question instead of heading right out of DFW and straight for his Caddy . Except he could n't do that because , more than anything , he needed to get back on the tour . " Splendid ! " She beamed . At the same time , she charged forward , skirts whirling , dragging the children and umbrellas , while her newspapers and magazines waved in the breeze and her butterscotch hair flew . Just looking at her made him tired . She let go of the little girl , grabbed Kenny 's hand , and began to pump it . For a small woman , she had a lot of pump . " Delighted to meet you , Mr. Traveler . " The cherries bobbed on her perky straw hat . " Emma Wells-Finch . " The little boy drew back his sneaker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shin . " I do n't like you ! " Kenny glared at the kid , thought about smacking him , then considered smacking Francesca instead , right after he gave her his opinion of low-down blackmailers . Lady Emma turned to the kid , but instead of whalin ' him like he deserved , she frowned . " Reggie , dear , take your finger out of your nose . It 's most unattractive , is n't it ? And apologize to Mr. Traveler . " The kid wiped his finger on Kenny 's jeans . Kenny was just getting ready to slam-dunk the little brat when a harried-looking woman came rushing up . " Thank you , Emma dear , for watching them for me . Reggie , Penelope , were you good for Miss Wells-Finch ? " " Perfect angels , " Lady Emma replied , her tone so sincere that Kenny choked on the sour apple Jelly Belly that had been lurking in the corner of his mouth . Lady Emma ended up pounding him on the back . Unfortunately , she pounded like she pumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rib crack . When he got his breath back , the Children of the Damned had disappeared , along with their mother . " Well ... " Lady Emma smiled at him . " Here we are . " Kenny felt dizzy . Part of it might have been his busted rib , but most of it was trying to get his mind to make the connection between all that upper crust British cheer and a face that should have a streetlight shining down on it . While Kenny was recovering , Emma made an assessment of her own . As the headmistress of St. Gertrude 's School for Girls for the past two years , in addition to having been a teacher there , as well as a St. Gert 's student from the time she was six , she had grown accustomed to sizing people up quickly . It only took her a moment to conclude that this All-American cowboy was exactly what she neededa man with more good looks than character . Crisp black hair curled from beneath the brim of a biscuit-colored Stetson that looked so at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His navy T-shirt , printed with a Cadillac logo , displayed a more than respectable chest , and faded jeans molded to narrow hips and legs that were both lean and muscular . She noted the hand-tooled cowboy boots . They were nicely broken in , but she was n't surprised to see that they did n't seem to have come close to a load of manure . He had a thin blade of a nose , strong cheekbones , a well-formed mouth , and straight white teeth . And his eyes . The color of wild hyacinths and marsh violets . Outrageous for a man to have eyes like that . Her cursory inspection also told her everything she needed to know about his character . She saw indolence in his slouching posture , arrogance in the angle of his head , and the flicker of something unmistakably carnal in those half-lidded marsh violet eyes . She repressed a small shiver . " Let 's be off , then , Mr. Traveler . You 're a bit late , are n't you ? I do hope no one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to take , but she hit his chest instead . The Times fell out , along with the new biography of Sam Houston she 'd been reading , and one of the chocolate bars her hips did n't need , but which she enjoyed nonetheless . She bent to pick everything up just as he took a step forward . Her straw brim bumped his knee , and her hat flew off to join the pile on the floor . She set it back over her unruly curls . " Sorry . " She was n't normally clumsy , but she 'd been so distracted by her troubles lately that her best friend , Penelope Briggs , told her she was in imminent danger of turning into one of those " dotty , dear things " so beloved by British mystery writers . The idea of becoming a " dotty , dear thing " when she was barely thirty depressed her unbearably , so she did n't let herself think about it . Besides , if everything went according to plan , that worry would disappear . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her carry-all when she was done , but how much initiative could one expect from a man who had been born so physically blessed ? " Let 's be off , then . " She pointed the proper direction with her rolled umbrella . She had nearly reached the end of the gate area before she realized he was n't following her . She turned to see what was wrong . He was staring at her extended brolly . It was a perfectly ordinary brolly , and she could n't imagine why he seemed so mesmerized by it . Maybe he was more slow-witted than she 'd originally thought . " You ... uh ... always point the direction like that ? " he asked . She glanced down at her floral brolly and wondered what on earth he was talking about . " We need to go to luggage claim , " she explained patiently , jiggling the handle just a bit for emphasis . " I know that . " " Well , then ? " He developed a slightly dazed look . " Never mind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her gauzy skirt swirled around her legs , and a lock of hair blew across her cheek . She probably should have taken a few minutes to tidy up a bit before she 'd got off the plane , but she 'd been so busy entertaining the children who were seated across from her that she had n't thought of it . " Mr. Traveler , it occurs to me ... " She realized she was talking to herself . She stopped , looked back , and spotted him gazing into the window of a souvenir shop . She stood patiently tapping her foot while she waited for him to join her . He continued to stare into the window . With a sigh , she marched back to join him . " Is something wrong ? " " Wrong ? " " We need to get my luggage . " He looked up . " I was thinking I might like a new key chain . " " You wish to buy one now ? " " Maybe . " She waited . He sidled six inches to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really think we should carry on . " " See , I 've got this Gucci key chain a friend of mine gave me a couple years ago . But I do n't much like things with other people 's initials on them . " " You received this key chain a few years ago ? " " Yes , ma'am . " She remembered a sermon she 'd once heard about the way God sometimes compensated human beings who were born handicapped in one area by richly endowing them in another . Someone who was born with exceptional good looks , for example , might be dull-witted . A pang of compassion struck her , along with a sense of relief . His denseness would make the next two weeks so much easier . " Very well . I 'll wait . " He continued to study the display . Her arms were beginning to ache from the combined weight of her carry-ons . She finally extended her carry-all . " Would you mind taking this for me ? " He regarded it doubtfully . " It looks heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded vaguely , then returned his attention to the window . She switched the carry-all to her other arm . Finally , she could n't stand it any longer . " Would you like some help ? " " Oh , I can pay for it myself . " " That 's not what I meant . Would you like some help making your selection ? " " Now , see , that 's what got me into trouble in the first place . I let somebody else choose my key chain . " Her shoulders had begun to scream in protest . " Mr. Traveler , we really have to be going now , do n't we ? Perhaps you could do this some other time ? " " I s'pose I could , but the selection might not be as good . " Her patience frayed . " Very well , then ! Get the one with the cowboy on it . " " Yeah ? You like that one ? " She forced her jaw to unclench . " I adore it . " " The cowboy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop , paused on the way to admire a display of tea towels , then took forever to chat with the attractive young woman behind the counter . Finally , he emerged with a small package , which he immediately deposited in her cramped fingers . " Here you go . " " What 's this ? " He looked exasperated . " The key chain . You said you liked the cowboy . " " The key chain was for you ! " " Now , why would I want a key chain with a cowboy on it when I 've got a perfectly good Gucci in my pocket ? " He took off down the corridor , and she could have sworn she heard him whistling " Hail Britannia . " Twenty minutes later , they were standing in the parking garage while Emma stared at his car in dismay . It was a large American luxury automobile , a late-model champagne-colored Cadillac Eldorado . " I ca n't possibly afford this . " He unlocked the trunk with a flick of his wrist . " Beg pardon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finances , but a poor one managing her own . Since the old buildings were expensive to maintain , there was never enough money , and when the school desperately needed a new copying machine or piece of laboratory equipment , Emma had developed the habit of dipping into her own pockets . As a result , she was operating on a tight budget . She could n't quite hide her embarrassment . " I 'm afraid there 's been some mistake , Mr. Traveler . I have a limited budget . When I told Francesca I could only afford to pay my driver fifty dollars a day , she indicated that would cover your services . But it ca n't possibly be enough for the use of a car like this . " " Fifty dollars a day ? " She wanted to believe her head was pounding from jet lag , but she 'd always been a good traveler , and she suspected her headache came from frustration . Communicating with this gorgeous fool was more difficult than dealing with her slowest students . Not only did he move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand any of her instructions . Even after the incident with the key chain , it had taken her forever to get him to baggage claim . " This is quite embarrassing . I thought Francesca would have discussed all this with you . You 're expecting more than fifty dollars , are n't you ? " He lifted her two heavy suitcases into the boot with surprisingly little effort , considering that , only moments earlier , he 'd acted as if carrying those same bags out to his car posed a major threat to his skeletal system . Once again , her eyes strayed to the well-developed muscles his T-shirt did n't quite conceal . Would n't a person actually have to expend energy to build muscles like that ? " I guess it depends on what all besides driving that fifty dollars is supposed to cover . " He took her carry-all and tossed it next to her suitcase . Then he regarded her handbag . " I 'm surprised the airlines did n't make you check that thing . Do you want it in the trunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her headache had traveled from her temples to the back of her neck . " Perhaps we should return to the terminal where we can sit down and discuss all this . " " Too far to walk . " He crossed his arms and leaned against the trunk . As she considered how much to tell him , she gazed at the cheery April sunshine outside the parking garage and thought what a contrast it provided to her dismal thoughts . " I taught history before I became headmistress at St. Gert 's , and " " Head Mistress ? " " Yes , and " " You really go around calling yourself that ? A Head Mistress ? " " It 's what I do . " He looked vastly amused . " For proper people , you British sure do have some racy job titles . " If another American had twitted her about this , she would have laughed , but there was something about his manner that made her get as starchy as Helen Pruitt , the chemistry teacher . " Be that as it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ears . She even sounded like Helen Pruitt . " I 've spent the past year working on a paper about Lady Sarah Thornton , an Englishwoman who traveled through Texas during the 1870s . She also happened to be a St. Gert 's girl . The paper 's nearly done , but I need access to several of the libraries here to finish it , and since I have a break between the spring and summer terms , this seemed like a good time for the trip . Francesca recommended you as my guide , and she indicated that fifty dollars a day would pay for your services . " " Services ? " " As my guide , " she repeated . " My driver . " " Uh-huh . Well , I 'm glad to hear that 's all you 've got in mind , ' cause when you said services , I thought you might have meant something else , in which case fifty dollars would n't nearly cover it . " He still looked amused , although she did n't understand why . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dallas , I need to visit the library at the University of Texas , and " " Driving ? That 's all you want . " It was n't nearly all she wanted , but now was n't the time to mention that she would also need him to introduce her to the seamier side of Texas life . " It is a large state . " " No . I meant no other services . " " What other services do you offer ? " He grinned . " Tell you what . I 'll start you out with the basic package , and then we can talk about add-ons later . " With her limited funds , she was n't comfortable with uncertainty . " I always think it 's better to clear up things right from the beginning , do n't you agree ? " " We 're clear enough for now . " He moved toward the passenger side of the car and opened the door for her to slide inside . " You 're paying me fifty dollars a day to drive you around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll just bet you do . Watch your skirt there . " He slammed the door , then got in on the other side . " You could save money , you know , by buying a couple of road maps and driving yourself . " He shut his door and slid the key in the ignition . The spacious interior of the car smelled like gracious living , and the image of the Duke of Beddington sprang into her mind . She pushed it away . " I do n't drive , " she said . " Everybody over the age of fourteen drives . " With the barest glance over his shoulder , he backed out of the parking space , then headed toward the exit . " How long have you known Francesca ? " He swung out onto the roadway . She peeled her eyes from the Cadillac 's speedometer , which , from her vantage point , seemed to be climbing at an alarming rate . She forced herself to pretend that it registered kilometers . " I met her several years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're quite lovelyto film an interview she was doing for Francesa Today with several British actors . We enjoyed each other 's company , and we 've kept in touch ever since . I 'd planned to visit her while I was here , but she and her husband have temporarily moved to Florida . " Planes flew to Florida , too , Kenny thought . He was beginning to suspect Francesca knew exactly what a pain in the butt Lady Emma could be and that 's why she 'd deliberately dumped her on him . " About your expenses ... " Lady Emma looked worried as she regarded his Caddy . " This is such a large car . The cost of petrol alone must be prohibitive . " A small crease formed in her forehead , and she began to chew on her bottom lip . He wished she would n't do that . It was the damnedest thing . She 'd annoyed the hell out of him from the moment she 'd first opened her mouth , and he swore to God the next time she pointed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over his knee . But seeing that moist **26;357;TOOLONG mouth working away made him wonder how he was going to survive these next two weeks . In bed . The idea popped right into his head and stuck there . He smiled . This was exactly the kind of thinking that had made him a champion on three continents . The best way to avoid killing her was to get her naked as soon as possible . Preferably in the next couple of days . Moving in on her that fast would be a definite challenge , but Kenny did n't have anything better to do , so he figured he was up to it . He thought of the fifty dollars a day she was supposed to be paying him , then remembered the three million he 'd be picking up in commercial endorsements this year and smiled to himself . It was the first time he 'd smiled about money since his crooked business manager had landed Kenny in the scandal that had led to his suspension from the pro tour . His smile turned into a frown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had offered her fifty-dollar fee , and her even greater amusement when she 'd decided not to pass that particular tidbit on to Kenny . It never ceased to amaze him that a stony-hearted , steel-eyed bastard like Dallie Beaudine could n't control his wife better . The only woman who 'd ever gotten the best of Kenny had been his crazy mother . But having her nearly ruin his life had taught him lessons he 'd never forgotten , and he 'd made sure no woman held the upper hand since . He glanced over at Lady Emma with her butterscotch curls , baby-doll cheeks , floppy pink roses , and bouncing cherries . He 'd been maneuvering women all his adult life , and he 'd never yet let one of them forget her proper place . Right underneath him .
