<p> USA TODAY reporter Greg Boeck , whose father , Larry , covered Muhammad Ali for The ( Louisville ) Courier-Journal , returned home recently to retrace the time when he and a young boxer first crossed paths 33 years ago . <p> LOUISVILLE <p> During a September trip to his hometown , Muhammad Ali caught up with his brother , Rahaman , 56 , who had news for the sibling he grew up trading punches with in their old west end neighorhood . <p> He 'd just moved to a new apartment . His mailing address : Muhammad Ali Boulevard , a downtown street named after his famous brother years ago . " Now , " Muhammad said , " I know where to find you . " <p> This , too , is where you can invariably find Muhammad Ali . He has n't lived in Louisville for almost 30 years . But his heart and soul and history are forever embedded in this river city , where his roots remain as deep as the muddy Ohio River . This is where he grew up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Louisville Lip first told the world he was " The Greatest . " <p> This is where it all began . And , Ali whispered to me at a Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame induction ceremony two months ago , this is where it will all end . " I 'm coming back , " he said , beaming . He really never left . <p> Ali was long gone , bigger than life and working on regaining his title for the third time in the ' 70s when a package arrived at Leonard Tucker 's Louisville home . Inside was a can of " Muhammad Ali 's Champion Brand Shoe Polish , " mailed by Ali himself . <p> Tucker , now 88 and still living in Louisville , shows off the can proudly . It is their bond as lifelong Louisvillians , tied to the neighborhood where Ali grew up in the ' 50s and Tucker ran a small grocery store two blocks from Ali 's home . <p> " He put Louisville on the map , " Tucker says . <p> Tucker did even more  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a bunch of old gloves they were about to throw out at the YMCA and threw ' em in the yard behind my store , " Tucker grandly recalls . " About 7 o'clock every night , all the kids in the neighborhood would put the gloves on and box out there in the back . That 's where Cassius and Rudy ( his brother ) got their first gloves . " <p> The boys were grade-schoolers at the time , but even then Ali stood out . As a talker and a boxer . " He was a good kid who just talked a lot , " Tucker says . And in the back yard ? " Watching them , no one could catch Cassius to hit him . He 'd dance all around them . There was a kid , Snooky Baker , who became a pretty good boxer , but he could never catch Cassius to hit him . I saw a champion back then and I did n't know it . " <p> Gordon Davidson first met Ali in 1960 , after he 'd won his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rome . Davidson was the attorney for the Louisville Sponsoring Group , a partnership of 11 prominent businessmen who backed Ali 's venture into professional boxing with a six-year contract signed in 1961 . <p> They watched Ali pile up win after win . They heard him predict the very rounds he 'd win in and then boast to the world how great he was . But backstage , the Louisville Lip was anything but a boastful kid . <p> " He was very charming and very polite , " says Davidson , still a lawyer in Louisville and the only living member connected with the group . " With the group , in private , he was n't a brash , know-it-all type that he appeared in public . He was very easy to do business with . This PR act was just that , an act . People ask me , ' Who guided him ? ' He did it all by himself . Some of the group thought it was a bit overdone and were embarrassed by it , but most thought it was good at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sponsoring Group in 1967 , but Davidson 's wall in his downtown office overlooking Muhammad Ali Boulevard brings those times alive all over again . There 's a picture of Ali signing his first contract , another of him at a prefight news conference . <p> Davidson ran into the champ at a Kentucky Derby several years ago , and it was like yesterday . " We shook hands and he threw me a kiss , " Davidson says . <p> In Louisville , it was n't all hugs and kisses all the time , however . Ali 's conversion to the Muslim religion , change of name and subsequent refusal to join the Army on religious grounds alienated many in Louisville during the racially charged ' 60s . <p> " He put Louisville on the map , but a lot of people did n't like that , " says Billy Reed , a longtime Kentucky sportswriter . " You either supported him and said ' right on , ' or you said he 's a draft dodger , a rabble-rouser , a big mouth . He really galvanized people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ali is Louisville 's pride and joy . And vice versa . <p> He ultimately married a Louisville woman he grew up with and returns regularly to town , where he is adored and even revered . The Courier-Journal made his return for the Hall of Fame induction front-page news . " He was n't always the most popular person in his own hometown , " says his wife , Lonnie . " But Muhammad always has a way of coming out smelling like a rose . " <p> Yes , he does . His brother remembers when the rose was just budding . Their days together as kids were " special , " Rahaman says . " There was no dope in the city , no crime . It was different in the ' 50s , almost like heaven . He loved growing up here . We used to chase buses with our bikes . " <p> And they used to square off in the back yard of Tucker 's grocery store . " I whupped him , " Rahaman says . " I was No. 1 . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He throws his head back and roars at the memories . <p> I remember the champ as an 18-year-old kid trailing along with my father , Larry . This was 1966 , and my father spent the day retracing Ali 's roots in Louisville with the heavyweight champion for a magazine cover story . <p> We went back to his old west end neighborhood , where Ali dropped in unannounced to say hello to Tucker and visited neighbors on his old block . We stopped by Miles Park , a racetrack at the time , to visit three former Golden Gloves champions he had boxed with who were now jockeys . At the track , during a lull in activity , Ali turned to me and started shadow boxing , throwing those quick jabs he was noted for . " Here 's the punch that floored Liston in Maine , " he said of that famous , lightning-quick right that ended their bout in the first round . <p> Later , we ended up at his mom and dad 's new home in Buechel , a Louisville suburb , where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The story was headlined : " My Friend Cassius . " <p> When my father died in 1972 , Ali called my mother to offer condolences . Years later , as a young writer looking for an interview , I ran into Ali at a charity event . <p> He did n't recognize me , but when I introduced myself as " Larry Boeck 's son " his eyes widened and he invited me into a room for a 15-minute , one-on-one interview . <p> I saw him again in Louisville at the Hall of Fame induction ceremony and showed him a copy of that story my father wrote 33 years earlier with me tagging along . <p> Although his hands trembled and his voice shook with a barely audible whisper after years of battling Parkinson 's disease , his eyes steeled right into mine . He drew me close and said , " He was a special friend . " <p> Then I asked him if he remembered that day in his old hometown . " Yes , " he said , then added , " I 'm coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ali , in his prime <p> Height . . . . . . . . 6-3 <p> Weight . . . . . . . . 210 1/2 <p> Reach . . . . . . . . 82 <p> Chest ( normal ) . . . . . . . . 43 <p> Chest ( expanded ) . . . . . . . . 45 1/2 <p> Waist . . . . . . . . 34 <p> Biceps . . . . . . . . 15 1/2 <p> Neck . . . . . . . . 17 1/2 <p> Wrist . . . . . . . . 8 <p> Calf . . . . . . . . 17 <p> Ankle . . . . . . . . 10 <p> Thigh . . . . . . . . 25 <p> Fist . . . . . . . . 12 1/2 <p> Forearm . . . . . . . . 15
