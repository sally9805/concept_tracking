Zip 's getting married , " Chase tells Marianne , coming into the bedroom and shutting the door behind him . <p> " Oh . Who 's the woman ? " <p> " Her name is Flora Ritchie . " <p> " And when is the baby due ? " <p> He narrows his eyes at her . " December He pulls his shirt off . " But it was still a bitchy thing to say <p> " Sorry She watches him throw the shirt onto a chair . She is already in bed , propped up on a pillow against the rough wooden wall . She closes her book , keeping her index finger in to hold the place . " So , who is she ? " <p> " Some girl he met in the schools . She 's a traveling music teacher , I guess , " <p> " I wonder what she 's like . " <p> " She 's coming here tomorrow . You 'll find out then He lets his jeans slip to the floor and leaves them there . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But you are <p> " It 's a half-assed way to get married . " <p> " You think all ways of getting married are half-assed <p> " Oh , Jesus , Marianne . " <p> She gets out of bed and picks up his jeans , and folds them . " Were they serious , before she got pregnant ? I mean , would they have gotten married anyway ? " <p> " I did n't ask , " Chase says , going into the bathroom and shutting the door . <p> The sportswriters call Chase Savoie the wise man of basketball . One year , early in his career , they tried referring to him as " Savvy " Savoie , but it was n't a nickname that stuck . Mostly they content themselves with what they can do with his first name . " The Thrill of the Chase , " said the Sports Illustrated cover . The story in Newsweek , when the team was on the verge of winning the championship for the third out of four years , was called " Chasing Glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the big one , that compared him to Walt Frazier , Bill Russell , and Larry Bird . Then as he got older and kept playing , the stories had titles like , " Is the Chase Winding Down ? " and " Chasing Thirty-Five . " Chase has framed the clippings and hung them by the bed , so Marianne sees them first thing every morning and last thing at night . <p> She met him at a beauty contest fourteen years ago . She was Miss Oregon and he was one of the judges . He had seemed gloomy and depressed when he interviewed her , so she invited him out for a hamburger . It was unethical , but she did n't care ; she was n't going to win anyway . The contest was full of real killers : girls who owned dozens of beauty titles already , at the age of seventeen ; girls who had moved hundreds of miles away from their families so they could train with professional coaches in baton twirling or ventriloquism . The contest billed itself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-two , was foolish enough to almost believe it ; he rolled his eyes and told Marianne over a beer that he had half expected to see young ladies parading before him , solemnly reciting Wordsworth . <p> Where have you been ? she asked . <p> On a basketball court , he told her , whenever I was n't holed up in one of the Yale libraries . <p> Oh . She had never heard of him before  --  he had just finished his first year in the pros-but she knew enough to be impressed . She had never met anyone as smart , as big , as sternly handsome . He asked her what she was doing in the pageant , and she told him she wanted to be an actress . <p> Do n't be a jerk , he said . Go to college . <p> He seemed so pleased with the idea of setting her straight that she did n't have the heart to tell him she was planning to go to college anyway . She went to bed with him in his motel room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check ( she finished fourth ) and followed him up to Maine , where he lived during the off-season . <p> The entourage then was pretty much what it is now . There was a secretary , a cook , and Chase 's agent , darting in and out . Chase 's brothers , Danny , Zip , and Doug , ranged in age then from fifteen down to nine , and there was a guy known as " the tutor , " who took care of them , overseeing their swimming and sailing and tennis . When Chase was around , he coached them in basketball for a couple of hours every afternoon . Chase 's mother , Mimi , wandered around murmuring about finishing her dissertation on learning disabilities in the inner city schools ( which she still has n't finished ) . Chase 's father had already been dead for six years when Marianne came . He 'd been a doctor from a Boston family otherwise made up of bankers , so the infusion of Chase 's basketball money did n't appear to Marianne to be throwing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discreet ; Chase 's astronomical salary only seemed to make them more so . <p> She settled in as Chase 's girlfriend , but before long she 'd taken on another role , as a kind of emotional business manager for the boys . Chase took care of them all financially , and Mimi provided a sort of vague spiritual guidance ; she built a special pavilion , solely for the purpose of meditation and reflection , at the lakeside Maine tourist camp Chase had bought for them all to summer in . But it was Marianne who became the real parent in the family . <p> When Danny was thrown out of prep school for drugs , Marianne went around New England with him looking for another school that would take him , and she helped him write college application essays about how his expulsion , which was a big blot on his already mediocre record , had helped him grow as a person . When Dougie flunked seventh grade and got held back , and Chase raged and threatened to stop his allowance , she took Doug to Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she hired a teacher to come to the house every day after school to work with him . When Danny , at nineteen , was found by the police on the middle of a railroad bridge one night , holding a gun , screaming that he had to stay right there , at the very center , or the world would end , she bailed him out of jail ( Chase was out on the West Coast for a series of away games ) and got him to a good mental hospital , where the doctors told her it was definitely drugs and possibly manic depression . Mimi brought a bonsai tree for his bedside table and read to him from Zen in the Art of Archery . Marianne brought Zip and Doug in for counseling , and the doctor told her to watch out , she was going to have big problems with both of them . <p> In the beginning , she assumed she and Chase would get married . He never brought it up , and whenever she did , he told her that getting married would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she was already . <p> What about children ! Marianne asked him . <p> We 've got children , he said . <p> Not your brothers , children of our own . <p> We 're still young . We 've got plenty of time . <p> Now Chase is thirty-six and has one more season before he retires , and Marianne is thirty-one and telling herself that it still might happen . She 's made her peace with the fact that his stardom  --  a whole world of people a foot shorter than he is think he 's perfect  --  has given him a kind of arrogance and also an undeniable power . He calls the shots in this household . <p> He has bought Danny a chain of sporting goods stores , helped Zip set up a basketball clinic which tours to schools , and gotten Dougie an entry-level TV sportscaster job . Mimi has her own money , inherited from both her father and her husband , but it is Chase 's money that funds her more extravagant projects : the meditation pavilion , the Savoie Shelter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy cat and dog food for strays who would otherwise be put to sleep . <p> Marianne 's dependence on Chase is absolute . She 's never held a paying job in her life , never had her name on a lease or a mortgage , never had to worry about money . You could look at it another way and say that the Savoies depend on her , that without her , Chase would have been lonely , and the boys ' tangles with drugs and depression would have been far more disastrous . She does n't mind their dependence , considering it a mark of truly familial love . Still , she would like to be married . She would like to feel more officially entrenched . And she would like Chase to declare , before a multitude , that she is utterly necessary to him , his next of kin . <p> For the most part , she manages not to think about it anymore . Chase is right : it does n't make any difference . But occasionally , to Marianne 's own surprise , barbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Flora , everything that comes out of her mouth is sharp and dangerous . <p> Marianne 's first impression of Flora is that she looks like a girl off the wrapper of a chocolate bar . She has on a white blouse with puffy short sleeves , an olive-green dirndl skirt , and a darker green chamois vest that laces in zigzags over her chest . Her cheeks are washed with pink ( the glow of pregnancy ? ) , her red hair is worn in a braid down her back . She smiles at Marianne when she climbs down from Zip 's old Jeep , a bit tensely , unsure of her reception . Zip , beside her , is slow and reassuring , cupping her shoulders as he makes the introductions , and then rocking her gently , absently back and forth as they stand talking by the vegetable garden , where Marianne has been picking lettuce for lunch . Marianne is intrigued by Zip 's air of sleepy confidence : the sleepiness is habitual , but the confidence she has never seen before-except when Zip is doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching him with Flora , of the day when Chase saw a skunk run under their bed , and Zip managed to coax it into his hands and carry it out of the house without getting sprayed . <p> " I ' 11 take her luggage around to the Bullfrog , " Zip says . " Maybe you guys want to get to know each other <p> " Sure , " Marianne says , trying to sound comforting , picking up the look of panic that crosses Flora 's face . Zip gives Flora a long slow kiss before he goes ( Marianne looks away ; it 's like being in the first row at the movies ) , and then , surprisingly , he hugs Marianne . His body is damp and fruity-smelling beneath his blue T-shirt , which has YES , I REALLY AM HIS BROTHER printed on it . <p> " Well , " Marianne says as soon as he goes . " How are you feeling ? " She has decided that the best way to put Flora at ease is to acknowledge the pregnancy right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Okay . " <p> " No morning sickness , or anything ! " They begin to walk toward the main house , where the family gathers for meals . Mimi has built her own house down by the lake , and the boys each have a cabin , with Pullman kitchens for morning coffee , but the biggest kitchen and dining room are in the main house , where Chase and Marianne live . <p> " I did in the first couple of months , but not anymore <p> " That 's right , you 're pretty far along , are n't you ! " <p> " Five months <p> " You really do n't look pregnant <p> " I know . I was beginning to worry it meant a small baby , but the doctor said it 's normal . A lot of people do n't show at all till six months . You can see it without clothes , though She stops walking to pull up her shirt and push down the elastic waistband of her skirt . Her belly swells white and round below the bulging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the elastic on her skin . " You want to feel ? " she asks . <p> " Oh , no thanks . " <p> " It 's hard , " Flora says , putting her own hand there . " I always thought it would be soft , but it 's like a rock . " <p> " Can you feel the baby moving ? " Marianne asks , walking again toward the house . <p> " Not all the time , but sometimes She smiles . " I was going to have an abortion , but now I 'm glad I did n't Her voice , even when she is talking about her own happiness , is cool and flat . <p> " Zip must be really excited about the baby <p> " He 's great with kids , " Flora says . " That 's how I first met him . He was running one of his basketball clinics , at a school where <p> was teaching She looks at Marianne . ' ( You and Chase do n't have children , do you ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Oh , " she says . " Oh . I thought you were . Zip always says ' Chase and Marianne : and I guess I just thought  --  " <p> " That 's okay . " She is beginning to find Flora 's lack of artifice a little exhausting . Is it really possible that she could have reached the age of  --  what ? twenty-four ? twenty-five ?  --  and have so little finesse or protective covering of any kind ! But then , Zip does n't have much protective covering , either . The two of them , she thinks , are going to get creamed . <p> " This really is a wonderful place , " Flora says , gazing around at the old tourist cabins scattered among the trees . <p> " We love it , " Marianne says . <p> " It feels so real , I mean , like real people live here <p> " Gee , " Marianne drawls , " how ' bout that ? " <p> Flora blushes . Even her bare legs turn rosy above her galumphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The way Zip talks about Chase , I was n't sure what to expect <p> Her embarrassment is cut short by Mimi , appearing at the edge of the woods in a bathing suit and a big straw hat . She waves and trots over to them , her bare feet toughly oblivious of pebbles and pine cones . She holds out her hands to Flora . " It 's so lovely to meet you ! " she says warmly , and then she swoops in and embraces her . " We 're just delighted about you and Zip . Really . And of course , the little one <p> " Thank you Flora swallows , looking immensely relieved . Mimi turns to Marianne and hooks an arm in hers . " I 've just had the most wonderful idea <p> " What . " <p> Mimi holds out her other arm to Flora and then begins to stroll , pulling them both along . " I think we should plant an asparagus bed . Right on that flat place , below the strawberries . The drainage is excellent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you think it 'll be marvelous  --  asparagus from our own garden ? " <p> At lunch , Mimi interrupts the general conversation to say , " Oh , and Chase , there 's that trunk of linens in the attic <p> They all look at her : What ? Zip has been telling Flora the story of the tourist camp , how Chase bought it from a woman who had inherited it from her mother , who had run it as a summer retreat for Jehovah 's Witnesses . <p> " You know , " Mimi continues , looking at Chase a bit impatiently , as if she does n't understand why his mind is n't running along the same lines as hers . " That stuff from your father 's mother . Four sets of everything , for when you children get married She turns to Flora . " We 'll go up after lunch , and you can pick out what you want . " <p> Marianne trails up the attic stairs after them , knowing it 's masochism . The trunk is almost directly over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list , taped there so long ago that the paper makes a cracking sound when Mimi pulls at it , and it comes off leaving a frame of brown tape behind . <p> " Fingerbowl doilies , " Mimi reads . " Well , some of this stuff is ridiculous . But let 's have a look <p> Marianne reaches out and helps Flora , carefully , to unfold the layers of white tissue paper . They lift out stacks of napkins , damask and linen , lace-edged and plain . " There are eight sets of twelve , " Mimi says , looking at her list and calculating , " so Flora , you can choose two <p> " How beautiful , " Flora breathes , fingering lace . <p> Mimi picks up a stack wrapped in cellophane and pushes her reading glasses up to squint at a tiny white label . " Do you know , I do n't believe these were ever used ? Ireland . My guess is that Zip 's grandmother bought these the year before she died . Ireland was one of her last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Flora asks , sitting back on her heels . <p> Marianne , despite herself , also hopes for anecdotes . All she knows is that everyone was tall ; in all the old brown pictures that show them standing next to friends , servants , college teammates , the Savoies tower above everyone else , as though they belong to <p> different race or species . Chase does n't seem to know or care much about his family 's history , and Mimi is too vague to be much of a storyteller . Maybe the trunk of linen will cast some sort of spell on her , loosen her tongue or her memory . <p> But Mimi says , " Oh , not very interesting , I do n't think . Bigoted . Stuffy . Dogs and horses . She always scared me to death <p> Flora chooses , out of all the napkins , two sets with wide lace borders . Good , Marianne thinks , preferring the plainer ones . <p> They go through more layers of napkins , then linen towels , table runners , place mats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grandmother did those , " Mimi sniffs . " Her only hobby " ) . Thirty-two linen pillowcases . Everything is neatly organized into layers , in multiples of four , ready to be divided . <p> Mimi seems unaware of any awkwardness in the three of them engaging in this task together . But Marianne notices that as they make their way down through the trunk and the riches accumulate , Flora seems to grow more and more embarrassed , shrinking among the towering piles of white . " Oh , boy , what 'll I ever do with all this ? " she finally says , placing six bureau scarves on top of one of the stacks . " Really , Mimi , this seems like plenty <p> But Mimi is digging out tablecloths , lace after lace after lace . Finally a few plain ones , damask and linen cutwork . <p> Flora shoots a quick look at Marianne . " Oh , " she hesitates , and then puts her hand on the two plainest . " This is fine , I guess , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind some of what she guesses Marianne may want , too . <p> " Oh  --  " Marianne says , before she can stop herself . <p> Mimi and Flora both look at her , when that little sound of disappointment escapes . <p> " Well , " Mimi murmurs finally , lightly stroking Flora 's pink forearm , " you must be tired . Maybe that is enough for one day . " <p> Zip and Flora decide they want a big wedding , two weeks from Saturday , on the lawn in front of the main house . They want to ask everyone they know , everyone the family has ever known . They look defiant and proud , announcing this . They decide there 's not enough time to fool around with printed invitations , they 'll just call people . Chase lends them Trudy , his secretary , to help with the calls and the arrangements . They get hold of the minister who christened Zip ; he 's retired now , and living on Long Island , but he agrees to drive up to perform the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is struggling to make it in L.A. , and offers to fly the whole band east if they 'll play for the wedding . Mimi drives down to Boston to get her own wedding dress out of storage and altered to fit Flora 's swollen abdomen . Even Danny and Doug , who go through cyclic drunk/stoned and sober periods , and who at the moment are both perpetually bombed , pitch in with the planning , volunteering to pick up liquor , dry cleaning , people at the airport . <p> Through it all , Flora sits on the sidelines , watching the Savoies tossing the wedding together , apparently having no preferences , no desires , no family of her own . <p> " Oh , sure , she 's got a mother and father , " Chase says , looking surprised , when Marianne asks him . He 's gone out of his way to spend time with Flora since she arrived , sitting with her in the living room after dinner , driving her into town one afternoon when she wanted to mail a letter . Interviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partisan . <p> " Is n't it usual for the bride 's family to plan the wedding ? " Marianne has to be careful , make herself sound neutral , not bitter . She 's been sitting on the sidelines , too , as the wedding plans rumble along , and she 's not sure if she 's sitting there because she chooses to or because her position really has grown more awkward , now that a true wife and daughter-in-law is coming into the family . <p> " She tells me her parents are a bit overwhelmed by the whole situation , " Chase says . <p> " By the baby , or by the idea of you ? " <p> " Both , I guess . Anyway , they 'll come to the wedding , but they do n't want any more involvement than that <p> They do n't want it , Marianne wonders , or they 're too frightened to ask for it ? Her own parents have faded from her life . She 's never asked them to visit and they 've never asked to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a shopping bag full of extravagant presents , to stay for a week . They 've met Chase a few times , when his team was in Portland playing the Trail Blazers . They thought he was very nice , but she knows they find him intimidating . They never phone her ; when they have something special to tell her about , like a sister 's engagement or the death of her high school boyfriend , her mother writes a letter , and Marianne calls them . <p> " She 's the best thing that ever happened to Zip , " Chase says . <p> " Mmm , " says Marianne . <p> " Do n't you think he seems calmer than you 've ever seen him ? And happier ? " <p> He does , but Marianne finds Chase 's enthusiasm irritating . Since when is he so pro-marriage ? <p> " Now that he has Flora , and the baby , he 's got a reason to be responsible . Do n't you think ? " <p> Marianne does n't answer . She is remembering what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time Zip OD 'd , and they had n't known whether it was accidental or on purpose . The shrink watched them sympathetically but , she thought , judgmentally , and talked about how Zip was convinced that nothing he did would ever be good enough . <p> We know that , Chase said impatiently . <p> Knowing it is one thing . Navigating it is something else . You have to make it possible for Zip to come to you with problems before they blow up like this . <p> He can come to me if he wants . <p> Well , let him know that . But do n't give him all the answers . What I would do , if I were you , is just open the door and play dumb . <p> " I think you 're right , " Marianne tells Chase now , slinging an arm around his waist , which is level with her shoulders . " He really has pulled himself together . " <p> She comes upon Mimi and Flora on the lawn . <p> " I thought the altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real altar , of course , just that narrow table from my library , with a cloth over it . A white cloth , do you think , or should we go for a spot of color ? " <p> Then Mimi sees her coming , and stops talking . They actually jump apart a little , guiltily , so that Marianne feels she 's stumbled upon a tryst . <p> " I think a colored cloth would be nicer , " Marianne offers . " I have some fabrics Chase and I bought in Provence last year , which I 've never done anything with . Would you like to look at those ! " <p> Sure , they say , exchanging glances , as though they 've just unexpectedly gotten away with something . <p> That 's when Marianne decides to go , just for a few days . She worries , because of the way they 've begun tiptoeing around her , that everyone will think she 's fleeing in a huff , but she ca n't help that . And as it turns out , Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Boston ! " he says . " Are you sure you do n't want to wait till after the wedding ! I 'd come down with you , then , for <p> few days . " <p> " No , there are some things I 'd like to take care of this week . Get my hair done , buy a dress for the wedding . And you and Mimi seem to have the planning pretty much under control . " <p> " Well , let 's go away together after this whole thing is over He kisses the top of her head . " We 'll do one of those fjord cruises , or that bird-watching thing in Alaska . Think about it <p> " I will , " she promises . <p> She stays in Cambridge , at a plain-looking , expensive hotel in Harvard Square . She constructs for herself the kind of cultivated , sanitized life she imagines she might have now without Chase  --  museums , bookstores , modest restaurants . Her tastes , after more than a decade with Chase , have inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department stores that would have so attracted her during her beauty contest days , and takes instead the ferry that runs out to the harbor islands , where she spends an afternoon wandering around a deserted civil war fort . The fort is supposed to be haunted , according to the guidebook , by a woman who was executed for trying to help her imprisoned husband escape . <p> She does go to Filene 's Basement one afternoon , where she has a momentary flirtation over a table of men 's shirts . " What size are you looking for ? " asks a man in a tweed jacket standing next to her . <p> " I could n't begin to tell you , " she says , smiling back at him . She heads down to the dress racks , where she finds a turquoise silk from a fancy store , one she often shops in , reduced to a quarter of its original price . Marianne buys it , feeling it proves somehow that she could survive without Chase . She could get a job , find <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would take <p> little extra cunning , but she could do it . <p> The rehearsal dinner , at Mimi 's , is big , warm , and jolly : the nicest event Marianne has ever seen in the Savoie family . A strange collection of people : friends of Zip 's in thrift-shop funk , hair bleached and spiky . Flora 's sisters and their husbands , the sisters with blue eyeliner and charm bracelets and frosted , blow-dried Princess Di hair , the husbands bricklayers and electricians with careful table manners . Some of Chase 's teammates , at a different level from the rest of the guests , like mountaintops poking through the clouds , heartily egalitarian , gods leaning down to converse with mortals . Chase , beaming . Mimi , flitting through , murmuring nervously , " I think we should start getting people into the dining room , do n't you ! " And Zip , calm and happy , in a navy blazer and the new mustache he 's grown over the past two weeks , hovering around Flora , refilling her orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Marianne 's surprise , has n't dressed up at all ; she 's wearing the olive-green dirndl skirt with a man 's shirt tucked into it , and she looks uncomfortably bunchy around the waist . She has on knee socks and a scuffed pair of clogs . Her face is so grim and miserable-looking that Marianne feels sorry for her , and strolls over to talk . " How are you doing ? " Are you going nuts with all this wedding stuff ? " <p> " Not really , " Flora says , not smiling . " I have been . But now I feel like the whole thing 's finally in motion , so all we can do is just relax and go with it . " <p> Mimi puts a light hand on each of their backs . " I think we 'd better get people into the dining room . " <p> In Mimi 's dining room , with its wide windows overlooking the lake , six tables for eight have been beautifully set . But it does n't feel at all formal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knife tapped on a water glass , someone giving a toast . People tell stories about Zip as a child , as a teenager . " To Zip and Flora , " they end , and everyone drinks . Chase tells about Zip and the skunk . Someone tells about the basketball clinic , and how Zip paid for real hoops when he found some kids in a playground using a garbage can to shoot baskets . Chase gets up again and talks about how in the fifteen years since the family started summering in this place , there have been some wonderful parties here , like the one the first year the team won the championship ( applause ) , and the one the second year they won ( applause ) , and especially the one the third year ( applause and cheers ) , but that this is the best party of them all . Dougie gets up unsteadily and says how happy he is to have a new sister-in-law , and a new niece or nephew . Embarrassed laughter , and everybody drinks . Zip stands up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toast to Flora 's parents . Then Flora 's father stands up , short and dark and pale , and he holds up his glass and looks straight at Zip and says , " Take care of my girl A momentary silence . <p> Danny gets up , the court jester , and defuses things by telling <p> long unintelligible joke which has " shit " in the punchline . People laugh uncertainly when it 's over , and Danny raises his glass silently and then sits down . Chase stands up again , and talks about how happy he is . <p> After the dinner , Chase takes a couple of his teammates down to the lake for a swim , and Marianne stays to help Mimi oversee the cleanup . Mimi says , " Well , I hope we have a groom tomorrow . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> Mimi shakes her head . " There 's been a psychiatrist in and out of here all week .

All the lights are on tonight in the tourist camp , in all the cabins that are usually empty : the Whippoorwill , the Cathy-O , Faraway , Gone . This is how the camp must have been in long-ago summers : lamplight reaching out to meet other lamplight , radios playing softly , muffled voices from behind the cabin walls , distant shouts and splashing from the lake . Climbing the last stretch of path up from the lake , she smells the sweet , unmistakable scent of marijuana . For some reason , she does n't just ignore it and keep walking . <p> " Who is it ? " she asks . <p> After a moment , Zip 's voice . " Me .

" Go stay with Flora , " she tells him . <p> She wo n't tell Chase , she decides , getting undressed . If things have been this bad all week , then Chase already knows what 's going on .

" Danny asks . <p> She looks at her watch . " Show the guests into the garden , I guess . And act like nothing 's wrong . " <p> " Sure thing , " says Doug . <p> In the garden , two hundred people mill around . Zip 's old green rowboat is up on pilings , filled with ice and liquor . A yellow tent , its poles wrapped with vines , is filled with flowers and balloons . Danny and Doug , lilies of the valley in their lapels , stand on either side of an archway made of two blossoming : cherry trees in pots , bent toward each other so that their branches intertwine . " Come on through , " they say jauntily to Marianne , and she wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Is Zip back ? " she whispers to Doug . <p> " Nope . " <p> " Marianne , how are you ? " someone asks , and she is sucked into the party . People say things to her . <p> " You look wonderful . " <p> " Is n't this the perfect spot for a wedding ? " <p> " Chase must be so thrilled . " <p> She looks at her watch : just after ten-thirty . The wedding is scheduled for eleven . <p> " Such a beautiful dress . I love the color <p> " So Chase is planning to retire after next season ? Ca n't you talk him out of it ? " <p> " What about the bride ? What 's she like ? " <p> " Where is Chase , anyway ? " <p> " And Zip  --  where 's Zip ? " It 's ten past when someone finally asks this : Gloria Rangeley , married to Carl Rangeley from the team . Marianne has always liked Gloria , who has her own line of mail-order cosmetics for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed if he gets traded , Gloria says . I move , but the fulfillment house stays in the same place . It 's just good business . When are you going to line something up for yourself , to make sure you do n't get totally killed ? " Is anything wrong ? " Gloria asks now , in a lower voice . <p> Marianne peers back into her kind face , glowing beneath a fuchsia straw hat . " Oh , no , no , just a little delay <p> " I heard a rumor that the groom has n't showed up , " another voice at her elbow . <p> " Oh , I 'm sure that 's not true , " Marianne says . <p> A quarter of twelve . Chase comes out onto the lawn , in a checked shirt and jeans . Holds up his hands . " Thank you all for coming , but I 'm afraid there is n't going to be a wedding here today . Please stay , and eat and drink . Thank you again He puts his head down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Murmur , murmur , murmur . A fat lady in a monogrammed sweater is crying . A huge hand wraps around Marianne 's upper arm . " Hey , man , tell Chase I 'm really sorry , okay ? " She hears from someone that the minister is angry : he drove all the way up from Long Island and he 's damned if he 's going to drive all the way home without his lunch . She hears screaming from the living room , a man 's voice , furious . Zip must be in there , and some man is giving him hell . But no , Danny reports , when she sends him in to check , it 's a retired stockbroker , an old friend of Mimi 's , telling a Wall Street joke . People cut into the Brie , rummage around in the rowboat for beer . <p> " It was the minister 's fault , " Marianne overhears someone saying . " He said something to Flora right before the ceremony was supposed to start , and she took of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , " someone else says . <p> Marianne looks up at the shaded windows of her bedroom , wondering if Chase is up there . How can he stand it , listening to this party going on ! She wants to go up to him , comfort him , ask about Zip  --  does anyone know where he is ?  --  but she 's become , in the absence of Chase and Mimi , the hostess of the party , and she keeps saying thank you to people who tell her how sorry they are . <p> Finally , Chase comes back out , and holds up his hands . " Thank you very much for coming . I 've closed the bar now . Thank you for coming The guests begin to move at once , seven-footers ducking under the cherry-tree archway . " Please take your presents back with you , " Chase says , his eyes full of water . It 's the kind of crying no one acknowledges and neither does he ; people are having quiet farewell conversations with him as though it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , an old Shetland sweater thrown over the shoulders of her party dress . She is crying in <p> sniffly , brittle way that makes people not dare to approach her . She flutters around looking very busy , doing nothing , talking to no one . Every now and then as people pass by her , discreetly looking away , she recognizes friends and she snatches at them , crying , " You 're not leaving ? " Yes , yes , we have to get back , work , traffic , they mumble , and she lets go of them . <p> " Where 's Flora ? " Marianne murmurs to Doug , not wanting to intrude on Mimi ; but he , oblivious , calls out , " Hey , Mom , do you know where Flora is ? " <p> " Her father 's with her , " Mimi says , coming over to them . " They 're taking her home with them , " She catches sight of the rowboat , still half-full of bottles . " Oh , no , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Chase , Chase ! What are we going to do about the liquor ? " <p> He sprints over to her , not wanting to conduct this conversation in shouts . " The Ritchies paid for it , so we ca n't exactly keep <p> " Is Zip back ? " Marianne asks him . It 's the first chance she 's had to ask . <p> " He 's in the woods , " Chase says flatly . " He 's sitting on the rocks down by that little waterfall . He would n't come <p> " What about a charity ball ? " Mimi asks , sniffing . " Could we donate it , do you think ? " <p> " I do n't know of any , " Chase says . <p> She takes out a handkerchief and wipes her eyes . " Well , then , maybe the best course is to return it to a liquor store , and send Flora 's family a check . " <p> " But most of it 's been opened , " Chase points out . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks away from them . Danny is folding up the wooden chairs that were set up under the trees , for older people who might not be able to stand through the whole ceremony . Dougie watches him , grinning ; he ca n't help because of his hurt arm . " How did you hurt it , anyway ? " Marianne asks , standing right in front of him . <p> " In a bar . This guy said I was sitting too close to him , and I said it was public property , and he hit me <p> " Like this ? " she asks , punching his hurt arm . " Or was it more like this ! " Punching harder . <p> He stares at her , not even moving to protect himself . <p> " I do n't know what goes on in this family , " says a voice behind them , and Marianne turns to face Flora 's mother , pale and red-eyed in her shiny gray mother-of-the-bride dress . " But it 's sick . And it 's got to stop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over her spangled shoulder , Marianne sees Chase trying to catch her eye , shifting from foot to foot . " Excuse me , " Marianne says , and goes over to him . <p> He puts an arm around her and bends his head to speak into her ear . " Zip 's back . He 's upstairs , waiting . I 'm going to take him to the hospital <p> She nods . <p> " Will you be here when I get back ? " The anxiety in his voice is new . <p> " Sure , " she tells him , and then she goes back to help Danny finish folding the chairs . Doug is trying to help now , too , using his good arm to stack the chairs on the grass . He makes the stacks too high ; at one point , the top chairs start to slide off , but Marianne catches them and settles them uneasily back into place . <p>
