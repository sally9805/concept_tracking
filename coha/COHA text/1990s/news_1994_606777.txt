<p> Some leaders bring intellect to diplomacy . Some bring forcefulness . Still others bring an armada . Outgoing Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds 's handling of the Northern Ireland peace process is a case study in a more idiosyncratic approach : Reynolds brought Reynolds . <p> In confronting one of the world 's most delicate situations , he did what came naturally : He became a whirling dervish . He talked a lot and moved a lot and brought an exaggerated optimism to the whole enterprise . His actions kept everyone else moving and talking , bringing Catholic nationalists  --  armed and unarmed  --  out of political isolation and engaging them for the first time in democratic conversation . <p> Reynolds 's forced resignation as prime minister this week  --  in a controversy unrelated to the peace process  --  thus leaves a gap . He was a security blanket for Catholics in Northern Ireland , where Protestants are in the majority . But observers in London and Dublin , as well as U.S. analysts , believe the gap can be filled as efforts to end 25 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most substantive phase . <p> The drive for peace is extremely popular in Ireland and is supported by all major political figures , including Bertie Ahern , Ireland 's finance minister , who was chosen today to replace Reynolds as leader of the Fianna Fail party . If , as is likely , Ahern forms a coalition Tuesday with Ireland 's Labor Party , headed by Dick Spring , observers say the process will be further reinforced . Spring , as Reynolds ' deputy prime minister and foreign minister , was deeply enmeshed in the peace process . Fianna Fail is the traditional party of Irish nationalism and is more trusted by militants in Northern Ireland than its historical opponent , the Fine Gael party . <p> Indeed , some feel that Reynolds 's peculiar talents were just right for the first stage of the effort to resolve the strife in Northern Ireland  --  but not quite as right for the next difficult stages . He was best as a booster and a cheerleader , and was less effective at the nitty-gritty details . <p> Talks among British officials and Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to begin before Christmas . They will not be easy , because the threat of a return to violence is in some respects the only card held by the Irish Republican Army , a Catholic group that has fought to drive the British from Northern Ireland and unite it with the independent Republic of Ireland . In addition , demilitarization means a withdrawal of British troops from the province : While there have been 2 1/2 months of relative calm , Protestants and Catholics have been through 2 1/2 decades of violence . <p> Publication of a " joint framework " document by the governments of Britain and Ireland is expected soon . Designed to serve as a " talking paper " for a new relationship between the two nations and Northern Ireland , the document may include a statement of Ireland 's receptiveness to dropping its constitutionally enshrined claim that Northern Ireland belongs to the Republic . In return , there may be a proposal for allowing the Irish government some form of marginal participation in Northern Ireland 's affairs . <p> The joint framework document is finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of Reynolds 's departure is that those formalities will be delayed while Ireland 's parliament reconstitutes a government . <p> Finally , the British will propose a new elected assembly to take over the administration of Northern Ireland , now run by London-appointed bureaucrats . <p> All of this , British Prime Minister John Major has said , will be subject to a referendum . <p> In their rhetoric , the two warring sides in Northern Ireland remain irreconcilable . Catholic nationalists still insist on reunification with Ireland , while Protestant political leaders say they will never sever their tie with Britain . The goal of British and Irish officials , however , is to somehow get them talking to each other  --  if not directly , then through intermediaries . <p> Various schemes for a resolution have been tried since the late 1960s , when raids by Protestant militants into Catholic neighborhoods in Belfast and Londonderry prompted widespread rioting and the activation of armed paramilitary organizations on both sides . But none has gone as far as this one , in no small measure thanks to Reynolds . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Major signed last December , in which both governments declared , among other things , that any change in the political status of Northern Ireland would require the consent of the majority . It invited all parties committed to " exclusively peaceful methods ... to join in dialogue . " <p> Eight months of terrorism continued , with no response from either side of the warfare . Then , on Aug. 31 , the IRA declared a cease-fire . <p> Reynolds 's role became critical . Major declined to accept the IRA declaration or even discuss beginning talks until the IRA said its commitment was " permanent , " which neither it nor Sinn Fein , the IRA 's legal political wing , would do . Things could have fallen apart then . <p> Reynolds , however , immediately embraced the cease-fire , declaring with enthusiasm something he could not know for sure : that the violence was over " for good . " He was , he said , prepared to talk with Sinn Fein immediately . A week later , he invited Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling and posing with him . <p> It was a risky move . While their cause is popular as a theory in Ireland , the IRA and Sinn Fein are both deeply unpopular because of their violent ways . Hundreds of IRA fighters have been jailed in Ireland . Sinn Fein , born in Ireland in 1907 , performed dismally when it ran candidates for office in the Republic during the 1980s . <p> From Britain , and from Protestant leaders in Northern Ireland , came a barrage of criticism that Reynolds was moving too fast and was wildly out of step with Major . <p> Reynolds , however , believed that he should jump at any chance to bring Sinn Fein into the political dialogue , however one-sided . He not only began talks with Adams but also activated his old plan to convene a Forum for Peace and Reconciliation , where representatives of Sinn Fein and parties from both North and South could discuss the issues . <p> The forum , which has met regularly in the weeks since , has not attracted any representation from the Protestant political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has thus not been a venue for negotiation but rather for Adams and his allies to repeat their familiar demands . Indeed , at the beginning it was the object of some ridicule here , as was Reynolds 's overall behavior . <p> What it accomplished , however , was keep Sinn Fein engaged and create the appearance of progress . In this case , the appearance functions as the reality , for the IRA reportedly had been sharply divided when its leaders agreed to the cease-fire . Lack of progress , or the sense of it , could undermine Adams 's position and turn the IRA back to violence , observers still believe . <p> Meanwhile , Major was coming under attack from leaders of some Protestant organizations in the North who feared some " secret deal " had been made with Ireland . Major responded by assuring them that no substantive change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland would be made without a referendum there . <p> That statement was instrumental in persuading Protestant paramilitaries to join the cease-fire on Oct. 13 . <p> At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sync . In hindsight , however , by design or by chance , the two were complementary . Each was attempting to keep on board the distrustful opposing sides in Northern Ireland  --  Major the Protestants , Reynolds the Catholics .
