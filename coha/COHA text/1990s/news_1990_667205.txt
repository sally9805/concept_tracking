<p> It 's report card time again for Corporate USA . <p> Every day for two weeks , dozens of companies have told the public how they did in the three months that ended Sept. 30 . And investors , like some disappointed parents , are learning to accept lots of C 's and D 's . The economy has been lurching toward recession for months , dragging down corporate earnings . By now , expectations are so low - and the 1989 comparison quarter so bad - that this earnings season is bringing fewer bombshells and more pleasant surprises . <p> But the plain truth is that the pretax profits of U.S. companies have been declining , compared with same quarter of the previous year , since the second quarter of 1989 . This year , profits were down 11% in the first quarter and 7% in the second from the 1989 periods , says the Commerce Department . Standard &; Poor 's Corp . ' s Arnold Kaufman expects a 1% overall decline this year - and 9% in 1991 - even though he sees third- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters . <p> If you do n't toil in an executive suite or play the stock market , however , the hubbub over falling profits might sound like much ado about nothing . So what if corporate earnings are a little lame ? Is n't this just a case of big investors and top executives getting richer a little more slowly ? <p> Well , no . Accounting intricacies aside , earnings - or income or profits - can be thought of as a company 's savings : what 's left of the money a company takes in after it pays the day-to-day costs of running its business . <p> Profits keep a free-market economy humming . They help pay for the development of new plants , products , jobs . A sizable chunk of profits helps finance government in the form of taxes . Another chunk goes as dividends to shareholders - often the pension funds that pay for your retirement . Says economist Robert Aliber of the University of Chicago : " Economies will breathe but they wo n't grow without corporate profits . " <p> More crucial than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is their role as compass in steering the economy . It 's said that a free-market economy does a pretty efficient job of matching the resources needed to produce goods and services with the goods and services the people need or want . If that 's so , then profits point the way . <p> Consider this : When people really want something , they 'll pay a premium to get it . So the businesses that can figure out first what will sell big stand to make a fat profit , whether they 're peddling Bart Simpson T-shirts , Mazda Miatas or new kinds of computers or medicines . <p> Their success does n't go unnoticed . " If you make profits , this is just a red flag telling all the greedy people in the world that here 's a market for them to come and spoil , " says Richard J. Sweeney , economist and finance professor at Georgetown University . " So if you rest for one minute on your laurels , your profits are gone . What happens is , people swarm in . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . So you generate new ideas , new technologies , new jobs . " <p> Or you stumble . Look at what happened at Apple Computer . The company was first to mine the personal-computer market , and it struck gold . But Apple 's success became the stuff of Silicon Valley legend and brought out lots of competitors . Apple lost market share and now is struggling to regain its footing in the industry it created . <p> Sometimes potential profits do n't seem big enough to convince companies to meet what would seem to be crying needs , such as health care for the working poor or affordable urban housing . But by and large , the profit motive steers the supply-and-demand economy pretty well . <p> Everyone understands the consequences of falling profits at his or her company . At first , it 's lower raises , budget freezes , hiringxand promotion freezes ; if the slump persists , layoffs and shutdowns . But generally weak corporate profit growth still has far-reaching consequences : <p> - Taxes . Companies treat property taxes and other state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw materials . But corporate income taxes levied by the federal government and some states come out of profits ; when profits fall , so do those tax payments . Last summer , the Office of Management and Budget cut its estimate of this year 's take from federal corporate income taxes by $ 14 billion to $ 98 billion , contributing to the ever-widening federal budget deficit . <p> Bottom line : Falling corporate profits shift more of the tax burden to you , the individual taxpayer . <p> - Dividends . Profits of public companies have the greatest and most immediate effect on the company 's stock - stock increasingly held by the mutual funds holding your savings and the pension funds you count on for retirement . When an investor buys a share in a company , what he 's really buying is a share in that company 's profits , or in its potential for making profits . In most cases , he gets a share of those profits directly in the form of a regular dividend check . He also gets an indirect return on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so will the stock price . <p> The relationship between profits and stock prices is so crucial that despite the drop-off in earnings , most corporate CEOs are dead-set against cutting or eliminating dividend payments , lest they arouse shareholders ' wrath . Cutting dividends " is seen as a sign of weakness , " says James Solloway , chief economist at Argus Research . " When a company does reduce its dividend , its stock gets smacked . " This fall , for instance , investors battered beleaguered Chase Manhattan when the banking company broke down and slashed its dividend in the face of mounting financial woes . <p> - Investment . Profits that do n't go to pay taxes or dividends - called retained earnings - are usually plowed back into the business . ( Retained earnings can also be used to buy back stock , another bonus for shareholders . ) <p> It 's this source of money that 's really getting squeezed by the earnings slump and by companies ' determination to hang onto dividends . After hitting $ 70.5 billion in 1988 , retained earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the second quarter of this year , they were down to an annual rate of $ 33.2 billion . That means less money is available to build new factories , buy new equipment , hire more workers , acquire other companies or develop new products . All of that is bad news for U.S. companies struggling to compete with Japan and Europe . <p> True , companies also can finance expansion , new plants and research by borrowing money . But for many that borrowed heavily during the debt-crazy 1980s , that door is closed . <p> Bottom line : " Corporate profits are the fuel for future economic growth , " says Richard W. Rahn , chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . " Profits need to grow . " The alternative is a world of sharply limited choices and chances for the next generations . <p> TEXT OF GRAPHIC If you think a slump in corporate profits translates only into a little less bounty for the bountiful , think again .
