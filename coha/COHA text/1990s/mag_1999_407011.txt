BREAKFAST AT THE " TILTIN ' HILTON " WAS N'T AT ALL BAD , so long as we ignored the kitchen and dishwashing facility ( which we discovered-too late-was an open sewer running past the kitchen door ) . The eggs were fresh , no doubt provided that very morning by a scrawny quintet of hens who now pecked at bugs scurrying across the dining-room floor and occasionally hopped on our table , quizzically eyeing our plates as if inquiring about our satisfaction with their products . While we ate , a steady stream of customers of all ages marched through the dining room to a narrow counter at the rear and departed with laundrysized plastic bags stuffed with crinkly green leaves . These strange bundles , we were soon to learn , were coca leaves , an ever-present staple in the lives of the Andean Indians . Photograph Photograph // LAST MONTH , IN PART I , THE AUTHOR AND HIS COMPANTONS ARRANGED A HUNT FOR THE " TYRUKA " - the legendary four-antlered deer of the AndesWITH JOSE " PACO ' RADA . THEY TRAVELED TO CUZCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAMSHACKLE HOTEL IN THE HIGHLANDS . During the night Jose Rada 's ragtag crew of guides and packers had arrived , bringing with them a half-dozen of the most sad-faced and forsaken examples of horseflesh I 'd ever laid eyes on . Meanwhile , the three lovely senoritas who had accompanied us on the previous day 's misadventures had emerged , demurely , from the rooms where they had been cloistered for the night and were sipping the tar-like coffee that only South Americans can tolerate . Our plan was to ship them back to Cuzco in one of the two vehicles in which we 'd arrived , leaving us short one vehicle ( a situation which was to prove near disastrous during our retreat from the mountain several days later-but that 's a story for another time ) . Waving the girls out of sight , we at last turned our eyes to the mountain , but we saw only a low-hanging roof of clouds . Somewhere in those clouds-or above themwere , we hoped , " tyruka , " the mysterious four-antlered deer of the Andes that Sam Arnett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to find . We would be hunting at higher-much higher-altitudes than any of us had ever hunted , and even as we took our first step to the mountain , a forecast of doom settled itself about us . During the packing I 'd noticed that there were only two rifle cases . Rada had told us there was no need to bring our own rifles from the U.S. because he could supply excellent , scoped rifles for all . But now we were beginning the most important hunt of our lives with only two rifles among the three of us . Though horses and saddles were provided for our journey up the mountain , our final conditioning strategy was to make the three-day trek to base camp on foot . We figured this would better acclimate us to the increasingly thin atmosphere and thus make the final ascent easier . After aonths of running with a backpack loaded with bricks and daily stints of underwater swimming , I felt as tough and springy as a grasshopper and , as it turned out , the trail up to the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within a century of Columbus 's discovery of the New World , Spanish conquistadores had penetrated to the tops of the Andean peaks in their relentless quest for gold , enslaved the Indians and laid surprisingly good roads . About noon of the first day we broke out above the fog and found ourselves surrounded by steep green hillsides dotted here and there with clumps of trees and low brush . The clouds , which were now below us , rolled to the horizon with mountain peaks poking through like islands in a sea of white foam . In the distance a wall of granite soared to the heavens with such majesty that surrounding mountains seemed to kneel before it . That 's where we were going . During a mid-afternoon break , Rada let it be known that we were in " spectacled bear " country and that we might get a shot at one . A variety of black bear that gets its name from the lighter-colored hair around its eyes , the spectacled species hardly rates as one of the world 's great trophies , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . When we uncased the two rifles , however , we were stunned to discover that one of the two " fine " rifles Rada had promised to provide was a European model of humble origin fitted with a scope widely known for its tendency to fail under the most mundane of circumstances . The other rifle had no sights at all ! " No problem , " smiled Rada with his easy charm . " I have brought for you a very fine scope . " Sure enough , after digging through several packs , Rada produced a riflescope still new in its shipping box .

Photograph Sam Arnett used the coarse stone steps of a village church to file and fit a set of improper scope mounts to our borrowed rifles . Photograph When vacated , the high-walled IIama corral gave us protection from the winds , Our first game of the hunt were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's great , " allowed Sam . " So how do we get the damn thing on the rifle " " Ah , Senor Arnett , I myself know about such things and brought for you a set of rings and mounts for the rifle . " And with a flourish he produced a small box . Sam read the label on the box , looked at the rifle and then at me , and tossed the box back to Rada . " Wrong damn mounts , Paco . These wo n't fit the rifle . " " But Senor , how can that be ? " said Rada , his grin fading . " I bought them at a mucho famoso store in Lima . " By then I 'd taken the box from Rada and inspected its contents . The bases were indeed for another model of rifle , but there was a chance they might be made to work . " Look , " I explained , " the front base fits but the rear is too high . If we can cut it down it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's high spirits returned with the opportunity I had presented . " No problem , no problem . I myself know it is very easy to fix . " Our camp that night was a more or less flat area beside a thatch-roofed church . At first , it appeared to be abandoned , but inside there were unmistakable signs of occasional use , so our best guess was that a circuit-riding priest held services there once or twice a year . While the packers unloaded the weary horses and set up camp , Sam and I set about cutting the scope base down to a workable size . A broken file in Rada 's skimpy tool kit proved useless so we literally ground the base down to a manageable height by rubbing it on the coarse stone of the church steps . Perhaps this provided a special blessing because by sundown the scope was fitted and both rifles were sighted-in . The second day of our trek to the mountain was good and bad . The Indians in one of the valleys through which we passed felt that they owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if we were to hunt in their land we would have to pay . The price they set : enough soccer shirts to outfit two teams ! When the villagers saw us coming they came running and tried on the red , green and yellow shirts that Rada passed out . " What kind of humans are these , " I wondered as they posed for my camera , " that run after a soccer ball at 15,000 feet ? " The bad news that day was the foretaste of a weather phenomenon that could very well doom our hunt . Like clockwork , about noon each day , moisture-laden warm air is blown in from the Pacific lowlands . When it collides with the cold mountain air , heavy fog develops , usually lasting until after dark , and the higher the elevation the denser the fog . During the afternoon , the fog billowed so thick we could scarcely see the trail , and it was still covering us like a tent as we made camp . That night I got my first unpleasant taste of what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claustrophobic sense of being trapped in an airless tomb , brought on by a combination of thin air and the tight confinement of a small tent . Bobby suffered it , too ; only Sam snored peacefully . We arrived at our base camp-a squat , stone-walled , thatch-roofed village of a few dozen people-at mid-afternoon on the third day and found the villagers engaged in a bacchanalia known as the " Festival of the Animals . " As it turned out , we were unwelcome guests at one of the most important ceremonies of the year , in which they honor the beloved llamas that provide them with warm clothing , food and transportation . During the festival their custom is to get drunk on a local brew , herd a bunch of the better-looking llamas into a stone corral and decorate them with bright ribbons . Then they get into the corrals with the llamas and dance a strange jig ( which pretty much explains why they were n't too happy to have us witness their ritual ) . This unfriendly situation was made worse when the batteries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance music . Their appeals to Rada for fresh batteries were refused , with the reasoning that without music the festival would end sooner and the men would sober up and be able to guide us the next day . This proved a bad call , because even without batteries there was still plenty of the mean stuff they were drinking , and as the afternoon drifted into evening the glares of the normally friendly villagers sliced into us with hostility . Their only friendly concession was to allow us to pitch our tents inside the protective stone walls of a corral that was deeply layered with llama manure . I 'd been in favor of making camp a distance from the village , but that could be dangerous-even deadly-Rada informed me , because in the night subfreezing winds roar down from the peaks at over 50 miles per hour . Without the protection of the stone walls our tents would likely be swept away . The first day of actual hunting began with more than the normal amount of first-day confusion and sorting of gear . Rada had planned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungover and only a couple showed , which meant that we mainly depended on Rada 's regular crew , who had no more idea of where to look for tyruka than we three " Yanquis . " But by then we were pretty much accustomed to Rada 's plans going awry and faced the day 's inevitable disasters with cheerful resignation and even subdued optimism . At last , we were going hunting . Rada had to call it quits at the base camp because he was already having trouble breathing . Sam 's pocket altimeter read slightly over 15,000 feet , and we anticipated climbing another 3,000 to 5,000 . Maps of the area showed peaks well over 20,000 feet . Now it was time to ride the tough little horses . The mountain that rose almost perpendicular behind the village more or less leveled out on top , and that 's where we hoped to find the four-antlered deer . We were told the back side of the mountain was easier to climb than the steep face before us , but getting there was a half-day 's hike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but steeper frontal route . The little short-legged horses we rode were as steady and sure-footed as any mule I 've ever ridden . Mine , which I nicknamed Pegasus after the winged steed of Greek mythology , considered each step with care and wisely avoided loose gravel . Even more amazing were our Indian guides and packers . Bred over centuries for survival at high altitude , the men were seldom much over five feet tall , with short , thick climber 's legs and disproportionately huge chests for lungs that gleaned every available atom of oxygen from the thin air . Not once did I see any of them breathe hard , even when I was gasping , and they seemed to have no interest in resting-a condition no doubt brought on by their ubiquitous cud of coca leaf . When the going got especially tough they 'd take a softball-sized lump of some chalky-looking stuff from the folds of their llama-wool ponchos and slice off a nibble . This unappealing substance turned out to be made of ashes mixed with water and kneaded into a solid chunk for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes react with the coca drug to give an extra powerful energy boost . Whenever I saw the guides fortifying themselves with the supercharger ash ball I knew the climb ahead was going to be especially difficult .

" // At about 18,000 feet the mountain rounded off into a relatively flat plain where dry , stubby grass squeezed up between dark-tinted rocks . The scenery was as spectacular as any on earth , with snow-covered peaks rising beyond more peaks in every direction , like an endless ocean of mountains seen from outer space . From some ledges I peeked over . The earth plunged so steeply that one false step meant a free fall of thousands of feet . Seen from almost directly above , our blue tent glittered in the maze of stone walls like a tiny sapphire caught in a spider 's web . The first hour or so on top of the mountain was spent enjoying the view and getting the lay of the territory . Though the mountain seemed as unlivable as the moon , I spotted enough small animal droppings to convince me that something lived there . However , the lack of cover and deer sign told me that this was the wrong place to hunt tyruka . If they behaved like other deer they 'd be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to dig them out . Like hunting mule deer in the Rockies , this would be a matter of riding the rims and searching out each ravine and cul-de-sac , a not unpleasant prospect because at every turn there was a dazzling panorama of mountains and clouds . Clouds ! The morning had been bright and clear , but at midday , as we were having a lunch of cold , half-baked potatoes , the fog gathered around us and within minutes was so suffocatingly thick that the sun disappeared and with it all sense of direction . If we got lost in this fog we 'd have to spend the night on the freezing mountain , and the alarm on the faces of the two guides showed that they knew it as well as I. Luckily , we were able to find the My way we 'd came up that morning and the sure-footed Pegasus carried me back to camp , with Sam and Bobby returning from their hunt at the same time . We 'd all had a scare trying to get off the mountain in the thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd stay closer . At least we 'd be lost together . That evening as we sat around a stinking fire ( llama manure was the only fuel , but there was plenty in the corral ) , a tiny woman brought us a basket of potatoes . They were scarcely bigger than marbles . She was dressed in her finest , including a derby-shaped Indian hat with llama-wool earflaps dangling about her face . Apparently the potatoes were a peace offering . Spanish was no more known to her than English , but one of Rada 's guides knew some of the Indian dialect and through a two-way **25;405;TOOLONG by sign language from all-we learned that she had two sons who would go with us on the morrow . The next day was not what we 'd hoped for . The two /continued on page 103 Indian guides seemed to have no interest in hunting the four-antlered deer and , instead , led us to a valley where there was an enormous rock slide . Hopping about the rocks were marmot-sized animals that looked like rabbits with stubby ears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted us to shoot the animals , and when we 'd killed a couple they were eagerly retrieved . Closer inspection showed the critters to have a dense , chinchilla-like fur which we learned was prized for its warmth and used to insulate shoes . The Indians wanted us to keep shooting the little furbearers , but after bagging one or two more we told them we 'd come to shoot deer , not foot warmers . This led to an impasse , but it did n't matter because by then the fog was thickening and it was time to hurry off the mountain . Breathing was harder now and increasingly painful-sucking in the dry air had made my throat raw . During the day I 'd walked too fast for only a brief minute and had become so breathless that I 'd had to lie down until I could get my wind back . Sam and Bobby were having similar experiences , but more alarming than our physical condition was the change in our mental attitude . One symptom was an increasing lack of interest in what we were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our trek into the mountains we 'd had hearty appetites , but now eating seemed such a chore that we devised an easy-to-drink , energyrich cocktail of condensed milk and chocolate . The third day of our hunt for the tyruka began in disappointment and then teased us with a glimmer of hope , only to end in despair . Our Andean guides did n't return , leaving us to make do with Rada 's guides-who had become convinced that there were no deer to be found and sucked their coca leaves with glassy-eyed indifference . By now , though , Sam and Bobby and I pretty well knew the local geography and began searching out likely looking spots the same way we hunted deer back in the states . This resulted in our first positive deer sign ... and it was fresh ! It was in a grassy basin on the sunny , lee side of a steep crest , and the sign indicated that several deer had been feeding there . If we stayed below the crest on the high side of the basin we could get within easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day ? Time was running out . Despite my exhaustion , I was terrified of sleep . The mere act of breathing required such conscious effort that I feared an unguarded sleep would be never-ending . I tried to tell myself that it was a foolish fear , but simple reasoning was also a labor . That day we had begun checking our decision-making ability with simple riddles and memory tests . We realized that edema was robbing our lungs of their efficiency and making breathing increasingly difficult . It would kill us unless we got off the mountain . How much longer could we endure ? And when our lives become critically imperiled would we know itor care ? One more day , we decided , and then-tyruka or not-we 'd leave . That last day we were on the mountain just after dawn , and left our horses on the offside of the crest that rimmed the basin where we 'd seen deer sign the day before . On previous days we 'd taken turns with the two rifles . Today , it was my turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd get a shot even if the deer were there . But I had my camera and telephoto lens with me-even a picture of the fabled deer would be a trophy . The higher side of the rim offered a better view of the basin and better prospects for a clear shot , so it was quickly decided that Bobby and Sam would get the best shooting positions while I kept a lookout on the lower side where the basin curved out of their sight . If I spotted anything I 'd send one of the guides for them and they 'd do the same for me . With my breath coming in gasps , I crawled the last few yards up to the crest and peered into the basin . Nothing ! " But they have to be here , " I told myself , searching every rock and blade of grass with my binoculars . " They 've got to be here .... " The sun climbed higher and went about its business of warming the earth , but no deer came . Was there such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Had we been chasing a myth ? The fog came again , sweeping by me in wisps and filling the basin like dingy water . Soon it would be time to leave . I had begun to pack my camera when a small stone came rolling from above . It had been thrown by one of the guides , who was about 50 yards above me , waving frantically and pointing toward a part of the basin I could not see . They were there ! I tried to run but could n't ; it was too far and too steep . I 'd run a few steps and fall to my knees desperately sucking air into my lungs-then rise and fall again . The fog , the damn fog , was getting thicker , blotting out the man who was now only a few steps away . Would I ever see the deer ? " Damn the fog , damn it all to hell ! " As I lay there panting for air and cursing our luck , the fog suddenly lightened and for a fragment of a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Tyruka , the mysterious four-antlered deer of the Andes really existed ! Frantically , I grabbed my camera and focused on their outlines , but even as I pressed the shutter button the fog was closing again , cloaking the forms in dense gray mist . From somewhere up higher on the crest , two shots echoed , too close in sequence to have come from one rifle . Then there was the long , high-pitched " WHOOEEEEEE " of a Texas yell , like a cowboy herding longhorns , followed by an answering exultation from farther away . They had done it ! Exactly how the legend of the fourantlered deer began is shrouded in time , but it 's no doubt due to their peculiar antler formation of two long points forking from the base . Seen even from fairly close up , the deer do indeed appear to be wearing two sets of antlers . Would I go to that high place and hunt them again ? Probably .
