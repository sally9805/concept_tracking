FROM WASHINGTON TO WARSAW TO JERUSALEM , commemorations of the Holocaust took many shapes . In the U.S. capital President Clinton , Lech Walesa , Vaclav Havel and 8,000 guests  --  including a few hundred who were spared in the death camps  --  listened as survivor Elie Wiesel dedicated a Holocaust Memorial Museum . In Poland Vice President Al Gore honored the memory of resistance fighters killed in the Warsaw Uprising 50 years ago last week . Jerusalem received a most unexpected visitor : Martin Bormann , son of the Hitler aide of the same name , came to pay tribute at that city 's Holocaust memorial . There were discordant notes as well . In Washington Wiesel and others were outraged at the presence of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman , who had claimed in a 1988 book that the number of Holocaust deaths is widely exaggerated . Most shockingly , one in five American adults ( see the chart ) said in a survey they were unconvinced that the Holocaust had ever occurred . <P> CHART : NOT AVAILABLE <P> CREDIT : From a U.S. survey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Jewish Committee by the Roper Organization .
