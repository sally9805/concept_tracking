Usually Steve Lindsay was content to hear himself referred to as one of the new breed of money managers . That suited him perfectly . A new breed was by definition a virile , forward-looking fraternity , and those who belonged knew better than to aspire to anything else . On his best days Steve rode the markets and currency exchanges with the impeccable authority of an accomplished horseman who fears no bolt or reversal and cares nothing for finish lines . <p> It had not always been so . Not for Steve , at any rate . As a student at Brown he entertained for a while the thought that someone like himself might make a difference . He did n't know what difference that might be , but he expressed a healthy contempt for cynicism and took two elective courses in ethics . He inveighed against Reaganomics and the narrow provinciality of the me decade . In an American Studies class on the sixties he announced that twenty years earlier he would surely have burned his draft card and marched with the War Resisters League . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had taken on the postures of an activist without ever having had to risk a thing . <p> Now and again , in later years , when he had become accustomed to thinking of himself as a man without a vocation , though he spent each day gambling with other people 's money , he reminded his friends that he 'd been groomed for another life , that he 'd counted on his dual instinct for action and survival to bring him to another sort of cutting edge . He recalled his college role in an avant garde theatre production , a satire apparently , in which he smoked a cigar and impersonated a blundering American diplomat on assignment in an unnamed Latin American country . His five-year-old black Toyota convertible-a graduation gift from his parents-still wore the Amnesty International decal he 'd affixed to the windshield on the first day he took possession of the vehicle . His kid sister , already writing a doctoral thesis on Hannah Arendt at the New School , routinely expressed astonishment that he had n't yet burned out on " the money thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd known him in earlier days , she seemed certain that he was intended for something better , something in arts administration perhaps , though he 'd never had much patience for artists , or in politics , though he 'd never demonstrated a gift for debate or for consensus building . Amused by speculation about his future , he knew better than to believe in new beginnings . If he was destined to be a burnt out case , he 'd face the necessity to retool and reconsider only when there was no help for it . Such deliberations were best undertaken with substantial cash reserves in hand and with no restless nights to struggle through . <p> Moving from one modest enthusiasm to another , Steve had been content with the life of a modestly attractive single man . In an average month he 'd bedded two or three new women , mostly secretaries at the firm or the young lawyers who seemed to proliferate on the higher floors of his building like wildberries on an alpine mountainside . When business was good he 'd book a suite at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobster and champagne . The ritual appealed to his playmates , he thought , quite as much as it ought to have appealed to him , though often he wondered why he was spending so much money to achieve what was in any case plentifully available in late twentieth century New York City . <p> Still , living in a less than swank apartment in the East Village , he thought it likely that the spirit of his love fests might well have been diminished had they been set in his own humble dwelling . The prospect of identifying the family pictures on the wall for some earnest young attorney who 'd just stepped out of her alligator pumps was an instant turn off . For transactions of the sort he had in mindnot heartless , to be sure , but at all costs provisional-the high style of a hotel suite was the thing : no telephone calls , thank you , no half-drunk bottles of Perrier or Campari in the fridge , no trail of yesterday 's papers or cork-board reminders of appointments to be met . <p> Now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domestic arrangements that drove him to a hotel suite . An infirm parent , perhaps ? An embarrassing apartment mate ? On such occasions he spoke only of wanting to give his lady a special time , though he sensed that this was not what his lady hoped to hear . Once or twice he described himself as an inadequate housekeeper who had stupidly put off hiring someone to clean up after him , but this only led to assurances that , really , the condition of his apartment was of no importance . He thought it best to dispense more or less entirely with references to domestic virtue or incompetence . <p> Shula , of course , was a different matter . He 'd dated her three times in the course of a month , and he was debating whether or not to see her again . A divorced Israeli woman with one child , she ran a thriving export business and looked like she was equal to anything . She moved with a lithe precision , wore short leather skirts and smoked hand-rolled cigarettes , licking away stray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practiced tongue . She spoke four languages and obviously found Steve Lindsay amusing . Though she 'd refused thus far to sleep with him , refusing also his offer of hotel accommodations and a special time , she smartly squeezed his left buttock as they danced together at Birdland one night . Insisting that he show her his apartment , she spent their hours there looking at his old college books and asking him questions about the prints and postcards tacked to the walls . She told him a few things about her former husband and put on fresh lipstick twice on her visits to the bathroom . She laughed at his small jokes and smiled amiably at the nonsense he spoke on the subject of politics . Twice in one evening she reminded him that it was n't necessary to speak to her about Israel-there were many other subjects she preferred to discuss . A few years earlier , he reflected , he would not have been able to keep his hands off her . Now , in spite of her tight little body and dark inviting eyes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had the sense that he was watched , perhaps even mocked . When she held his hand she might well have been counting his pulse . <p> He had little to tell her about his business that she did not already know . She appeared , in fact , to know a great many things , and often in her presence he felt younger than he had felt in some time . In the elevator on the way down from her offices he lightly kissed her ear and she expertly brushed his cheek with the back of her hand . Once or twice she surprised him by abruptly terminating an exchange and looking at him as if he were tedious or , frankly , not very bright . When he told her that smoking was an unfortunate addiction and that very few of his friends smoked , she quoted playfully from Italo Svevo 's Confessions of Zeno and said she preferred Zeno to any well-behaved American she 'd ever met . Her four-year-old , she said , knew more about life than most Americans , whose jogging suits and exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd met were single-minded and provincial . The brighter ones had opinions , but they did n't care about anything besides their work " and not even that , if they tell you the truth . " If Steve had time to read and think , then his work was n't a bad thing . She 'd have to know him better before she could be sure . <p> He 'd never met anyone who moved so quickly-not always deftly-from one thought to another , who could seem at one moment intimate and playful , the next sharp and impatient . She had a hunger for thoughts and sensations he did n't imagine he could satisfy . At a Cuban restaurant on z3rd street she interrogated the maitre d ' for ten minutes to learn the name of an odd-looking dish she 'd never tried before . She lectured Steve for a half-hour on the dangers of failing to have a wart on his palm examined , and she insisted he tell her everything he could about the play he 'd liked so much in school , only to pronounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was through . He liked the way she stroked the edge of her nostril with a long painted fingernail when she listened , and he enjoyed the sight of her crossing and recrossing her nervous stockinged legs as she went from one cigarette to another . He imagined her the sort of woman who would rake his back with those lethal fingernails in the course of love-making , who would want to draw a little blood if she could . <p> One afternoon at lunch hour she accompanied him to the midtown camera district . He 'd told her about the old Leica his father owned and about his desire to buy just such a camera if he could find one . She knew nothing about cameras , as it happened , but she assured him that she would be a help with the Hasidim who owned most of the shops he 'd need to visit . The first three shops they tried had nothing he was after , but the fourth-a third-floor walk-up that looked like an old-fashioned sweatshop and smelled like a damp towel-had just the thing . Shula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then in English , so Steve would understand . Both clerks were dressed in black gabardine slacks and white dress shirts buttoned up to the throat . She told them they were in a hurry-she seemed always in a hurry-and asked why the shelves behind the counter were empty . " If you have cameras you want to sell , why not show them ? " she asked . " You want maybe to sell only to experts who do n't need to see what they 're buying ? " She too was in business , she said , and she 'd never heard of selling without showing , letting people look , maybe compare . It was a little stupid , no ? <p> The clerks did n't know quite what to make of her , but it was clear they did not find her funny . Steve tried for a moment to intervene , but she told him it was better if he left it to her- " I know these people , " she assured him-and he decided from that point to say nothing unless invited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude wooden counter , in what appeared to be good condition . Was he sure it was like the one his father had ? He was certain . Did he want maybe to try it ? He did n't know what she meant by " try it . " " You could hold it in your hand at least . See if it feels right . " He reminded her that he was not buying a set of golf clubs . " Very funny , " she replied . But really , was it possible he would buy an expensive thing , a used one , without trying it ? The clerk nearest them , who clearly followed every turn in their exchange , assured her that the Leica was insured against defects for thirty days . He was no more friendly than he had been when they first came in . Steve adjusted the lens setting , tested the shutter release , opened the camera and ran a finger around the cartridge well . Shula said they would soon have to go . Did he want to go further with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the counter a neatly printed sheet containing vital information . The Leica had been manufactured in 1954 , it had the following capacities , it was valued at $3000 , and it was being sold at $1850 . Did he understand correctly that it was not " the lady " who wished to buy , but her husband ? He was not her husband , she assured him . He had n't thought so , he said , in Yiddish . Her friend did n't look Jewish , and maybe-it was obviously not his business , but he 'd say so-maybe her friend was not happy that a woman should talk for him , when it was not her money he would be spending . <p> It was just the sort of thing Steve had feared , though he 'd understood not a word of Shula 's last exchange with the looming , repellent clerk . With one decisive gesture his chic Israeli companion had swept the information sheet to the floor , turned on her elegant heels , and announced that their excursion was terminated . " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in English , turning to Steve . " You want maybe she should go alone , and we can talk maybe about a camera ? " Steve said " I 'll come back , " but Shula told him to go on , stay , " you 'll get along very well with this person , " and though he protested that it was time also for him to get back to work , she flung a resonant goodbye and was out the door , heels clattering furiously in the corridor , before he could join her . <p> A bit embarrassed , and not hurting for money , Steve bought the camera and got out of the shop as quickly as he could . He had tried , briefly , to bargain with the clerk , but had given up at once . On his way down the steps , the camera secure in the capacious leather case he had bought for an additional forty dollars , he realized just how relieved he was to be escaping . There had been something offensive about the clerks , something steely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deference or sympathy or forgiveness . The clean-shaven one stripped the tape from the carton with a distracted but practiced efficiency . The bearded one , who had insulted Shula , wound his cruel unclean fingers through his long beard with a cold pulling motion , as though he were tightening a knot . <p> Steve had seen such people before , and had stayed away from them . They were not at all like the Jewish friends he had made at school , or the slick operators who worked several of the trading desks at his office . These two were something else , something that felt old and remote , though both camera salesmen were about his own age and worked ten minutes away from his own Sixth Avenue building . It seemed to him strange , but he could not quite hold them apart from the image in his mind of Shula . Was this a case of contamination by association ? He smiled for a moment as he thought of Shula , with her tight leather skirt and sharply painted red lips , being introduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women of the kind he 'd glimpsed a couple of times while visiting an acquaintance in Williamsburg . But she belonged with them , he felt , she knew them , as she herself had said , and there was in her an iron will , a resistance to the looser and easier sentiments , that was as remote and forbidding as their efficiencies and their studied refusal of personal warmth or color . <p> Back at his desk , the Leica locked away in a closet , the phone inquiries and stock quotations all but overwhelming , he could n't get Shula out of his mind . At a meeting of account managers at 3:3o he drummed his fingers and complained of a headache . Back at his desk an hour later , he answered phone messages and told a bond salesman he was sick and tired of his shtick . He thought of dropping in on his parents for dinner , but instead dialed Shula 's office . When there was no answer he grabbed his jacket and soon found himself walking downtown . He remembered after a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet , but that was no matter . He was in no mood for taking pictures . <p> He reached the camera district and stopped abruptly in front of the grim building where he 'd last seen Shula . His mouth was dry as he stepped into the lobby and saw the sign for the 31st Street Camera Exchange , with its ugly block lettering and its graceless black borders . Briefly he considered what he wanted to say to the stolid , unsmiling gentlemen , presumably still standing where he 'd left them at the third floor counter . It did not occur to him that by 6:30 they would have gone home to their families . Nor did he know quite what had driven him to return to a place he had left hours earlier with a sentiment bordering on shame and resentment . <p> Did he intend to demand , or extort , an apology ? If so , he was mad . Such persons apologized for nothing . They responded to no demands and acknowledged no claims upon them . And for what , in any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coarse , or crude , or belligerent , there were no laws against such behavior , and there was no possibility that anyone could have explained to a Hasidic businessman how he had offended a customer . Nor did Shula come on like a vulnerable waif . She spoke with an air of blunt assertiveness and often seemed to carry a chip on her shoulder . There was no reason that anyone would think her frail or timid . Had she not mocked the Hasids about their empty shelves ? Steve did n't quite know what the clerk had said to her in the end , but he could tell from the tone of his voice and the look on Shula 's face that the words were in the nature of a taunt . He might then have demanded an accounting . Instead he had let Shula leave , and he had handed over two thousand bucks to her assailant . Not impressive . Not nice . A little stupid , no ? <p> An hour later he was back in his apartment . He took off his shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Can I see you for a while ? " <p> " It 's late . " <p> " Not that late . Have you eaten dinner already ? " <p> " Of course I 've eaten dinner , you have n't ? " <p> " I 've been walking , and thinking . " <p> " You could come here and meet my family . Maybe then we could take a short walk . " <p> " That sounds good . I 'll eat something and come over . What floor is it ? " <p> " It 's the fifth floor . 5 G. Where did you walk ? " <p> " Downtown . I thought I would go back to the camera store . " <p> " You wanted to buy that camera ? " <p> " I bought it right after you left . " <p> " So already you wanted to return it ? " <p> " I did n't like the way it felt in my hand . " <p> " This is n't true . You 're not telling me . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it felt . I 'll tell you about it later . " <p> " It could be a good conversation , no ? " <p> " I was expecting a blow-up this afternoon , but I did n't expect you to leave me standing there . " <p> " You could have walked out , no ? " <p> " I did n't know what he said to you . Were you disappointed I did n't leave ? " <p> " You were interested in the camera . I was interested in other things . So , all right , you stayed and I left . Maybe you should have followed me , maybe I should also have stayed . But no , not disappointed . If you expect something , then maybe . If you do n't expect it . . . Eat something , then ring downstairs only once , so you do n't wake the boy if he 's sleeping . " <p> " I 'll be there in forty-five minutes . " <p> The apartment was more spacious than he 'd imagined , with handsome prints on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the couch . There was an Oriental rug on the floor-possibly an imitation , Steve could n't tell the difference-and what looked like a Venetian glass chandelier over the dining room table . There were wooden train cars and children 's books scattered about . The largest wall of the living room was covered , floor to ceiling , with books . Shula was still in her work clothes , the child had been put to bed-Steve was taken in for a brief glimpse-and Shula 's mother was preparing a pot roast in the kitchen . She had rinsed her hands before greeting him , and he saw that she had long , bright red fingernails and what had once been a very pretty face . She obviously dyed her hair-Steve did n't like dyed hair in older women-and had probably put on fresh make-up just before he arrived . Shula chided her for starting a pot roast so late in the evening , and she promised to come out and join them in the living room in due course . He nibbled on nuts and raisins while Shula mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid of the ebony Baldwin piano as if checking for the usual ivories inside . " Do you play ? " he asked her . " I played better when I had more time , but I 'm pretty good . " " You did n't tell me . " <p> They talked for a while about the apartment , about children 's books , about the disturbing Francis Bacon print at the end of the foyer , with its goiterous figures and its mirrors and its couplings . Steve did n't like working to make conversation . He felt more than ever that Shula was watching him , taking his measure . The mother had come in twice , stayed for a few minutes , grown restless , and disappeared . He had wanted to include her but did n't know how . Had she any interest in the grotesque Bacon print , or the piano ? Probably she knew not much more about them than he did . Even Shula tonight had little to say , discarding her half smoked cigarettes like the bits and pieces of the fragmentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested they take a walk she said she was tired , and her mother , standing at the door , asked if they would n't like to watch the television with her . A special on diplomacy . He declined , and the mother took up a seat next to him on the couch , content clearly to miss what remained of her television special . " So you 're joining us , ma ? " Shula asked . " I thought maybe I 'd find out who is this fellow . Does he mind ? " No , he did n't mind at all , though he felt uncomfortable enough , reaching for a sucking candy-perhaps it was a breath mint-in his jacket pocket and trying without drawing attention to put a little more distance between himself and the mother . <p> Like the daughter , she seemed not to have much small talk in her . He thought to ask her why she decided to leave Israel , or about her work , but he was afraid she 'd feel he was n't really interested . When she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were the last thing he 'd expected himself to be doing . Was he planning maybe to devote himself to something else ? He had n't had much time for planning , he replied . It was a difficult business he was in . He spoke of burn out . Did she know that expression ? She knew it , yes . She had in fact known it , as he would say , first hand . Shula had told him maybe about her older brother Yaron ? She had n't . Well , his picture was there , in the wooden frame on the table , under the alabaster lamp . He was handsome , no ? He was . <p> " And you know , when he was killed-by accident , in a street incident in Jerusalem-I thought I would make a way to remember him . You know what I 'm saying , no ? " <p> He thought he did , though he had no experience like this , he was very sorry , even his four grandparents were alive still , his own parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and play tennis . <p> " They play tennis ? " she asked . <p> " Yes , they enjoy that . " <p> " And you play with them , maybe ? " <p> " When I can , sometimes on the weekend , on a Saturday morning , in nice weather . " <p> And so he did n't know burn out ? Not yet , though he heard about it often enough from people who had worked longer than he had in his business . <p> " It 's a result of sensitivity , maybe , this burn out ? " she asked . " The sensitive ones burn out first ? " <p> " Perhaps that was it , " he said . He did n't know for certain . And did he think that it was her sensitivity , maybe , that had caused her to feel after two , maybe it was three years of mourning for her son and trying to write the story of his life that she just could not go on with it , that she had to turn her attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed yes , that it was a matter of sensitivity , that she had burned out on the whole thing . It was natural , of that he was sure . <p> " Natural ? " she asked . <p> " Yes , " he said . " I 'm sure . " <p> " You mean , by ' natural , ' all right , yes ? It 's all right with you that I burned out ? I can be a good person , no ? Even if I do not finish writing my son 's story ? " <p> He was aware that she had attached to the word " natural " a certain quality of meaning he had not intended , but he was unused to paying to words the kind of attention she paid . And besides , he had not wanted to be involved with the mother at all in this way . It seemed to him odd , disturbing really , that Shula had been sitting there watching without saying a word . Her face was drawn and tired looking , and she dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was she offended again ? Surely it was not possible that his innocent use of a word could offend them . He had meant only to put the mother at her ease , to say that anyone would burn out who had tried what she had attempted . If Shula did n't like that , she should at once tell him . So he felt , as he found himself saying that the mother should not be hard on herself when everyone knewShula would surely agree with him-that it was an impossible thing she had tried to accomplish . <p> But the mother was not satisfied . So she said , bluntly , though for a moment he thought he saw a faint smile cross her face . Was she enjoying herself a little at his expense ? That would be something ! Shula , on the other hand , was definitely not enjoying herself . She did n't think-she lifted her voice a little-she did n't think he knew what was impossible , not even what was hard . Here , accusing him , she got up and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something implacable in her voice and in her persistent circling movement that made him almost dizzy . He did not like these people . He did not like them , though he could not quite , not yet , could not tear himself away from them . He wanted to defend himself to them , though he did not understand what he had done or said to offend them , could not grasp how a modest conversation had changed so suddenly into what seemed a confrontation charged with anger . He found himself defending his use of the word natural , while Shula demanded that he explain what was important and comforting to him about the word . " Any idiot can be natural , " she said . " Natural is an idiot 's word for doing what he likes . You think you 're talking here with people who are natural ? " <p> He looked at her with mute astonishment . He could not very well say to her what he suddenly thought . That she was mad , her mother not much better . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had said she wanted to know him , but was very likely incensed at the thought that a man , possibly uncircumcised , was dating her daughter and visiting her at an improper hour . He did n't like the mother 's long red fingernails , the dyed hair only a little gray at the roots . It occurred to him that Shula too might dye her hair , that she was perhaps a redhead , her lustrous black hair a fraud . The chocolates wrapped in silverfoil in the cut glass dish on the table looked unappetizing , the foil wrappers dingy and handled . As he reached for one , letting the silence take over for a minute , he wondered what they would say if he let the wrapper drop to the floor after taking the soft , warm chocolate in his mouth . Instead he asked Shula where he should put it , and was surprised when she rose to fetch him an amber ash tray that she placed on the table before him . He licked the chocolate on his teeth , displayed them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether they would not like him to leave : they must be very tired , he said , what with all the fresh meat they 'd had to work at this evening . " Fresh meat ? " the mother asked . " What is this fresh meat ? " But Shula said , simply , that he was very funny , that they were all too tired to go on , that she was sorry she could not take a walk , and that she forgot sometimes how little Americans liked to argue . Did he know that in many places it was a sign of respect , even affection , to engage a person in argument ? He had n't heard that , no . And was he not defensive when he was challenged ? she asked . He did n't much like to be called an idiot , if that was what she was getting at . Especially not when the stakes were so small . " You think a word is small ? " she asked , the mother now watching with undisguised pleasure , the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that words show " how you think and how you are . " <p> " You see a hell of a lot more than I do , I can tell you that , " he said , and " it 's been a great pleasure visiting your gracious home . Your son looks very nice . " <p> He shook the mother 's hand and walked with Shula to the door . She moved slowly , two small steps ahead of him in stockinged feet , a gray ash dropping lazily from her fist onto the dark carpeted floor . He had been with her for less than two hours , and he felt-he knewthat he would not see her again . She reached to turn on the light by the door , and he saw , as she turned , that the expression on her face was as hard as it had been all evening . The lips were dry and colorless , and she said , quietly , " so you think maybe you are owed an apology ? " <p> " I want nothing from you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . She had phoned him at the office two weeks later , and he decided not to return her call . A month after that she showed up in person , coming right up to him as he started to put on his coat . " Waiting long ? " he asked . " Not long . I knew you 'd be coming out at 5 . You told me you do n't like to work late . " <p> They took the elevator together , standing silently shoulder to shoulder . On the sidewalk he looked at her uncertainly . She seemed somber , patient , one hand buried in the pocket of her black raincoat , the other gripping the handle of a weathered briefcase . " So you 'll let me take you for a drink ? " she asked . " I do n't want a drink , " he said , but she took him by the arm and pulled him alongside of her , around the corner , into a coffee shop with bright travel posters on the wall promising vacation getaways in Venezuela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to Venezuela you 're even crazier than I suspected , " he snapped , motioning at the posters as they slid into a booth and she took out a cigarette . " And I wish you would n't blow that smoke in my face just as we sit down to talk , " he said . " I may be stupid , but I know I do n't do my best when my eyes are watery and I 'm trying to look interested in what you 're saying , even though most of my attention is on turning away to avoid the next stream of smoke shot from your quivering little nostrils . " <p> " You 're very funny , " she said . " You sound angry , like a lover who 's hurt . It 's hard to believe we have n't even slept together . You 're very comfortable trying to insult me , as if we 'd known each other for a long time . As if we 'd practiced trading blows , and apologizing , and living to hurt each other again . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand is why you want to have anything more to do with me , " he said , glancing quickly at the menu and pausing long enough to order each of them a Greek salad and a coffee before going on . " Really , I ca n't see what more we need with each other . I do n't like your mother , she does n't like me . I 'm stupid , or dense , or too goddamn eager to please , or shallow , or whatever . I feel it , you do n't have to stop me , no , do n't stop me , I know what you think , and your mother . I could read it in your faces that night . I failed my test , I know it , I 'm a failure , it 's all right . I can live with that a lot better than abuse . I do n't like abuse . I do n't want condescension . I may be a twerp of a money manager , but I do n't deserve to be mocked , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to be admired . I want to be liked , I 'll admit that . But I do n't need to be admired , as if I were some sort of paragon or something . With you I feel it 's always a test . You look at me and look at me-like now , just like now-as if we were n't sitting in some cheap restaurant but at a tribunal , and your people were watching to see if I pass the test . " <p> " What is this test ? " she asked him . " I do n't know what is this test . So you 'll tell me ? Then I 'll know ? And maybe I can tell you it 's OK , you passed ? " <p> " Oh now , do n't you play that game with me , " he said . " It does n't become you . You , who care so much about words . Who decides what is natural and what is insulting , what is good and what is bad . Do n't you suddenly tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your lovely mother are in the habit of administering to prospective suitors . Unless maybe they come ready-made with the proper pedigree and all . Then maybe you do n't have to give the test at all . Then maybe the applicant does n't have to show his bona fides . Maybe he gets to pass go and come right to the point . Only the uncircumcised are held in suspicion , right ? We do n't get to show our stuff right away . Got to stand straight , shoulders back . Got to watch what we say . Must n't come on all uncouth and everything . Not the idiots , hey ? Not the goyim . " <p> He had never heard himself say such things before . He had never known that he thought them . The woman had a strange effect on him . He liked watching her struggle with the desire to blow him away-she knew , clearly , that a few well-aimed words could silence him , send him off with his tail between his legs-he liked the way she resisted the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she teased him about his " circumcision complex " and casually mentioned that she had never been in the habit of inviting home the men she dated-not for a drink , or a dinner , or a test . He even liked the smoke she forgot not to blow in his face , and enjoyed the way she gave a hard time to their surly waiter , asking him to replace the brown lettuce in her salad and to throw in additional black olives ( " You put two olives in a large Greek salad ? This you call olives ? " ) . He was afraid of her , he would always be afraid of her . He knew that . He hated the way she talked to him when he was a guest in her house , and he could n't understand why he was sitting with her in a coffee shop . She refused to say what she wanted with him-the answer was a little obvious , no ? She was interested . That was enough . And he ? Whether angry or hurt , he too was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - to make her feel she had done him a wrong . As far as she was concerned-this much he never once needed her to explain-she was always right . She had never a thing to apologize for . When she felt like it she might indulge in a few lines of sweet talk . She might show the goyim a little sweetness and light . But as to anything fundamental , well , let those with a bad conscience apologize and explain and make amends . She would no more bend a contrite little knee than her kinsmen in the camera shop . <p> When they had eaten their salads and drunk their coffee and sparred with each other for more than an hour she invited him to walk her home . The kid would be expecting her by 7:30 , she told him , and besides , she could see that her " boyfriend " was tired and needed some time to think . As they walked briskly uptown he thought he had never felt less tired . He was anxious , irritated , struck by the way she held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed the difficult part of their reconciliation . She asked if , on Saturday , he would join her and the boy on a day trip to the children 's museum in Tarrytown . She mentioned a Sunday afternoon trio concert at the New School , and asked when he usually took his vacation . When they stopped for a minute to let her empty a pebble from her shoe , she leaned on him with such confidence that he had to smile at her and was sorry when she resumed her characteristically independent stride . She soon forgot how sensitive she 'd made him and referred , casually , to the stupidity of the business types she knew and the " embarrassing " naivete-it must be deliberate , no ? - of the liberal communitarians who sat on the board of the co-op she lived in . It was clear that she expected no resistance from him , that they were expected , henceforth , to be as one , that insofar as he learned to associate himself with her views and her confidence he would cease ever to feel stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter-ego , the goy who 'd come in from the cold . <p> It all seemed to him amazing , funny , appealing . He was inclined to laugh in her face and to make her a marriage proposal , to accompany her and the boy on a harmless trip to Tarrytown and to demand that she spend a night with him at the Plaza . When , a block or two from her apartment , they ran into her former husband carrying an armful of groceries , he was disappointed that she did not introduce him as the successor and heir apparent . The husband seemed amiable , uncomfortable , eager to escape . He asked after his son and promised to pick him up on Friday at 5 for a basketball game at Madison Square Garden that Shula predicted the boy would sleep through . As the husband said his nice to see you and turned with his bags , a large avocado dropped from one and rolled a short way on the sidewalk before Shula retrieved it and stuffed it in his coat pocket . Steve saw himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself not at all tired . She suggested he come up and entertain the kid while she helped her mother put dinner on the table . It occurred to him that she might contrive to have him spend the night , and for a moment he thought to stop at a Walgreen 's on the next corner for a toothbrush . But he let it go and , three minutes later , found himself a happy man when she slipped her tongue between his teeth in the elevator and saw the two of them projected in the surveillance television screen hung from the elevator ceiling . <p> The mother did not at all seem surprised to see him . She took his coat and asked if he was feeling any better than he did on his previous visit . Within a few minutes she 'd poured him a glass of cranberry juice and explained how , two years earlier , they 'd acquired the Francis Bacon print he admired . She got him a book of children 's poems to read to the child , and set them up next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked over at Shula and wondered what on earth he was getting into , but he liked the smell of the chicken Kiev they were preparing and allowed himself to admire Shula 's angular features and muscular arms as she tossed the salad and pulled the cork from a bottle of Mouton Cadet . <p> Just a while earlier he had felt bitter and wounded , but he now felt himself a willing postulant , a witness-in-training of an elite sect whose rules and manners seemed at once forbidding and attractive . The boy called several questions to his mother in a Hebrew Steve could not understand , then turned to the nice man at his side and spoke to him in articulate English sentences . The piano sonata on the countertop kitchen radio sounded remote and tinny , though Shula hummed in accompaniment as she bent to take the bread from the oven . He noticed that the mother had placed a menorah a few inches from the radio and was inserting small yellow candles in preparation for a ritual he 'd heard about but never witnessed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candles was customary all over Jewish New York . He doubted he would be required to participate , but was prepared to do whatever he was asked . <p> The dinner went well . The child recited the Chanukah blessing beautifully , and Steve was relieved to find that he had neither to recite anything nor to blow out a candle . He intoned amen with the others , asked when it was necessary for a man to wear a yarmulke on his head , and was pleased that the boy wanted to sit next to him at table . He said he 'd never felt as far from burn out as he felt at that moment , and he laughed when the mother told him there were black poppy seeds caught between his teeth . Shula spoke of a book she was reading by the philosopher Martha Nussbaum , and asked him what he thought of the idea that every form of love , whatever its object , is always a species of self love . He said he did n't know , but promised to think about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tried to read " this Nussbaum , " but could n't do it . Maybe-they could set aside an evening-they would select a book , the three of them , and talk about it together in a few weeks . Shula protested that they had n't invited the man to dinner only to make him a part of a book club . <p> By ten o ' clock the boy said he was tired , and Steve , seeing there was no chance he would be asked to spend the night , got up to leave . They agreed they would meet again on Saturday morning at 11 , and he kissed all three family members at the door . Outside , a little stunned by the evening 's developments , he turned up his collar and decided to walk for a while in the crisp December air before hailing a cab . His sense of good fortune puzzled him , and he had an inclination to go back and ask whether some mistake had been made . He was , he would have reminded them , the same fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew himself to be attractive , though hardly irresistible , and by most standards bright . He could tell a story , warm a heart , hold a hand . He had straight teeth , high cheekbones and a repertoire of good moves . But he was not-here he mentally scanned the pages of the New York Times Arts and Leisure sectiondefinitely not a Vladimir Feltsman or a Pinchas Zuckerman . There was in him something soft , an appetite for comfort and a habit of selfforgiveness . He was tired , it was true , of women who liked him as he was , and he was ready to put himself in the hands of a woman made of sterner stuff . But what she would make of him he did not know , and in any case he feared he would not like this other self any better than he liked what he had seen in these iron-willed people who judged and disposed and shaped and reclaimed with an authority that could seem intimidating . When for a moment he imagined himself poised above Shula , her knees open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a black leather armchair beside the bed , calmly calling the shots and keeping score . He was surprised at how amusing , how comforting it all suddenly seemed to him , and he almost giggled at his ability to convert the fearful to the familiar . <p> A block from Times Square he noticed that a large crowd had formed at the 42nd Street intersection . Reluctantly , he moved closer , felt the edges of the crowd open to take him in . Above them , on a bright , grainy video screen hung from the side of the New York Times building , he saw ghastly images . A bus had been blown to pieces , and assorted limbs and torsos could be seen amidst the wreckage . Helmeted work crews were stepping over the debris , lifting bodies , snapping photos . What looked like an Israeli policeman , a yellow star on his jacket , addressed the news reporters on the scene , but the noise of the traffic and the 42nd Street crowd made it impossible to hear what he was saying . Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bodies of those around him swell and press against him . He looked up and saw , on the screen , shattered glass , and brightly colored cables , and shoes , and what had been a seat , the remains of a steering column . At his side , six or seven black boys in dark leather jackets told one another to shut up so they could hear what happened , and one of them said it would be a long time till he got on a bus again . <p> Steve had just made a move to get out of there when a tall , grave , bearded man-a Hasidic Jew , clearly-took him by the elbow , gently , and asked if he was Jewish . " You , I 'm asking you , are you Jewish ? " Steve did not know what to say . No , he was not Jewish ? No , he was one of the shamefully uncircumcised , but with a Jewish girlfriend and the prospect of a new life ? He knew , he remembered , that in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a disgusting , parochial assault on his resolutely secular dignity . He would have regarded the person who asked it as unclean , perhaps mad , as fanatics and other devout communicants were mad . But now he could only ask , in return , why that mattered , why " my friend " would ask such a question at such a place-here he looked around for a moment at the ethnically diverse crowd , the sea of many colored faces all around them - and at such a time . Did " my friend " not notice the expressions of concern and sympathy on the faces around them , on all the different kinds of faces ? <p> " Are you a Jew ? " the man insisted . " Are you ashamed ? Are you afraid ? " <p> " Who are you ? " Steve asked him . " What do you want ? " <p> " I want Jews , " said the man , pulling him by the arm , starting to open a way for them through the crowd . " Our people want no sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what you are and to act accordingly . You know , accordingly ? " <p> He looked hard at the man . He had seen others like him stopping passersby on 47th Street and leading them to sidewalk tables , escorting others into vans with bold Hebrew lettering on their sides . A modest silver hairpin attached the man 's skullcap to his dark , curly hair . The others nearby moved back as well as they could to let them pass , but the crowd had grown , the bodies were packed tightly together , and the man had somehow let go of Steve 's arm and found himself carried just a bit out of reach . He called to him loudly , over the heads , " so you 'll tell me , yes ? And you 'll come to our table-on the other corner , over there-and sign a pledge card , a pledge , and talk about the bus ? Not here , but with our people ? You 'll come ? " <p> " I 'll have to see , " Steve called to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " <p> " Do n't talk to that turkey , man , " said a young black woman standing behind him . " That turkey is crazy . I seen him here before , and he 's crazy . He 's gon na take your money , that what he 's here for . You can bet on that . " <p> " You do n't understand , " he said to her , over his shoulder . " You do n't know what these people are . " <p> Their bodies were pressed together now , he felt her against him , and he turned to look at her , at her fine dark skin and coiled dreadlocks and clear eyes , and he could smell the breath on her cold lips as she said , firmly , her hand on his collar , " and you do n't know nothin ' , man . " <p>
