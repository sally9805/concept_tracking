<p> They swear it 's just coincidence but Colorado 's fractious public television stations are contemplating a merger even as Congress is threatening to cut funding for public TV nationally . <p> " The timing stinks , " says James Morgese , general manager of KRMA . <p> Local managers claim their move predates Newt Gingrich 's . <p> Almost a year ago , Morgese of Channel 6 , Ted Krichels , general manager of KBDI Channel 12 , and Greg Sinn , general manager of KTSC Channel 8 in Pueblo , spent an afternoon together in Colorado Springs , a town where all three compete for audiences . The meeting was Morgese 's idea ; he thought the time was right to stop fighting for funding and viewers , to consolidate in order to assure their future . <p> " We put egos aside and talked about how we could work together , " Krichels said . <p> That alone was remarkable , particularly in the case of Channels 6 and 12 , whose previous managers refused to speak . " In 1980 they sued to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were the hippie radicals , they were old curmudgeons . Now , with other sharks in the water , we see more common ground . " <p> " Public TV has been at war with itself in Colorado for many years , " Morgese said . <p> Now they 're discussing moving in together . <p> " It 's not a panic move for survival , " Morgese said . But clearly , the mood in Washington " intensifies the discussion . " <p> Representatives of the three Colorado stations are due to meet again Tuesday with a " facilitator , " an economist with an extensive background in public broadcasting . In April , board members will be invited to a meeting for the first time . <p> The stations will have to resolve ideological , geographic , economic and other differences if they are to create a Colorado public broadcasting entity . <p> The plans are vague , but their joint future could look something like this : <p> Imagine a Colorado Public Television system composed of three frequencies - Channels 6 and 12 in Denver , Channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; science , news &; politics , educational &; kids ' programming . Picture a combined staff situated at KRMA 's building on Bannock Street . <p> Imagine Denver 's Channel 6 as the arts , culture and science station , carrying PBS ' " Masterpiece Theatre , " " Nature " and " Nova " in addition to local ballet and orchestral performances . <p> Envision Channel 12 as the news and public affairs station , producing a nightly Colorado news report with feeds from Pueblo and Grand Junction , in addition to carrying " Frontline , " " Washington Week in Review , " Peggy Noonan , Bill Moyers and other PBS politicos . <p> And let Channel 8 in Pueblo be the educational , how-to and children 's channel , with hits like " Barney " and " This Old House " in addition to " lifelong-learning " and college credit tele-courses . <p> Major program events , like Ken Burns ' " The Civil War , " might appear on all three stations at staggered times . <p> Sounds promising . <p> Krichels cautions that these plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide equal service across the state . " It could work with minitransmitters , " he said , or , more expensively , via satellite . <p> Many questions <p> But can the historically antagonistic stations agree on such basics as program content ? Who will call the programming shots ? And how would they merge financially without losing their individual character ? <p> South Carolina Educational TV , Maryland Public Television , Oregon Public Broadcasting and other systems have cooperated statewide to share costs , produce programs and improve signal strength . As a model , Channel 6 's Morgese points to Idaho , where there are " three stations with their own identities , yet they are able to take advantage of the economy of scale of a whole network . " <p> Once the talk turns to programming , ideology gets in the way in a hurry . <p> Will Channel 12 , for example , have to abandon its more radical programming choices ? <p> " We are not interested in creating some bland monolith , " said Krichels of Channel 12 . " The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Never shown on 6 <p> Specifically , can the station that broadcasts " Tongues Untied , " the controversial film about black homosexuals that included graphic language , collaborate with the station that refused to air it ? Can the station that aired an edited version of " Armistead Maupin 's Tales of the City " and scheduled it in the wee hours merge with the station that aired " Tales " uncut , in prime time during a begathon ? <p> Channel 12 would like to get together with Channel 6 if it can retain its reputation for presenting bold , cutting-edge material . But to Channel 6 , " cutting edge " is a euphemism for " over the line . " In separate interviews , the two station managers addressed the question before confronting each other . <p> " Channel 6 believes in certain nominally acceptable standards , " Morgese said . " ' Tongues Untied ' contained certain pieces not suitable for broadcast . We have n't crossed that bridge yet . " <p> Seek middle ground <p> " Maybe James and I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Krichels said . " Everybody is going to have to stretch . We 're going to have to tighten up , KRMA 's going to have to loosen up . " <p> Channel 12 may have to become more professional , Krichels allowed . " There 's a ' let a thousand flowers bloom ' philosophy around here , " he said . " Not all of them bloom . In a more advantageous scenario with more resources , we would have to put more thought into production aspects , be a little more intentional . " <p> Channel 6 , known for avoiding controversy or " advocacy " programs in favor of standbys like " Lawrence Welk , " may have to take more chances . <p> Sophisticated facility <p> The KRMA Channel 6 building is a state-of-the-art facility , the former site of KUSA Channel 9 on Bannock Street , fresh from a $ 3.5 million renovation . The facility holds a sizable studio and plenty of space for the other public broadcasting staffers to move in upstairs . <p> KBDI Channel 12 is a no-frills operation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouse . It 's a huge improvement over KBDI 's old space in Broomfield . As a light-rail car speeds by just outside his office window , Krichels says the long-term lease would afford a studio and training facility at the Media Center while business operations would be centralized at Channel 6 . <p> The concept of merging is " bigger than the ideological question for the moment , " Morgese said . " In the past , we dealt with that first and it pretty much stopped the discussion . " <p> Cost-saving secondary <p> For now , they 've postponed that inevitable morass . But Channel 12 's Krichels says he will have to be satisfied that the approach to some of the more risky material would not be dismissive . " Unless we can define a very dynamic vision , " he said , " we are not interested in doing it simply as a cost-saving measure - and I say that knowing full well what 's going on in Washington . " <p> In Washington , Gingrich and others propose cutting the $ 286 million Corporation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the amount of federal funding represents less than a dollar per taxpayer per year . <p> " That 's the same as RTD 's budget , the same as the baggage system at DIA , " Morgese said , defending the CPB allocation . <p> Morgese says he hopes for the best , expects the worst . <p> He fears the proposed cuts will have the effect of putting nearly 100 PBS stations off the air , particularly in rural areas . Morgese sees three camps in Washington : One is ideologically based and is simply out to get rid of the perceived " liberal " bias they find on PBS ; the second camp sees inefficiencies in the way public broadcasting operates ; the third is just trying to cut the budget . <p> Channel 6 has trimmed its current operating budget by 10 percent , just in case . <p> At the national level , Morgese says , public broadcasting 's budget " could use some more tweaking , but it 's not grossly bloated . " <p> In Colorado , however , the current public TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them geographical . " Right now , the Western Slope is almost another state . " In terms of the educational use of telecommunications , he said , Colorado ranks 43rd in the nation . <p> The station managers continue brainstorming . <p> " If we can get the politics and the philosophy worked out , the rest will fall into place , " Krichels said . <p> " I 'd love to have this reduced to an engineering problem .
