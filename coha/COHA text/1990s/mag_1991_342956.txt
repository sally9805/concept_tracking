When toy-truck maker Tonka bought Kenner Parker Toys in 1987 , the company added such venerable products as Monopoly and Play-Doh to its lineup . But Tonka , the third largest U.S. toymaker , also took on a staggering debt from the $674 million sale . The Minnesota-based company 's burdens grew worse with the recession , which coincided with a dearth of successful new Tonka products . Last week the toymaker decided to seek help from the big kid on the block . Hasbro ( 1990 sales : more than $1 billion ) , the largest U.S. toymaker , will acquire Tonka 's stock and debt in a deal worth about $500 million . Hasbro , which makes G.I. Joe , Cabbage Patch dolls and Playskool toys , earned $61 million in the first three quarters of 1990 , while Tonka lost $25 million in the same period .
