<p> The scene looks ordinary enough : gently rolling hills stretch off into the distance , covered only with the scrubby little plants that can withstand the rigors of the Arctic winter . But the unremarkable vista here hides a multitude of archaeological treasures . <p> " You can see how these pieces of quartz have been worked , flaked in a way that could n't be natural , " says Bill Fitzhugh , running his fingers along the sharp edges of milky-white bits of rock he has picked up off the ground . " This is no surprise , because this hill we 're standing on sits right in a valley which would have been rich with game animals . And it 's right on the route from the Bering Strait . " <p> It also comes as no surprise that Dr. Fitzhugh , who directs the Arctic Studies Center at the Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C. , has tracked down signs of early human activity in such an innocuous-looking place . He has done so repeatedly on the " 1995 North Pacific Rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending here in Alaska that retraced the route early humans took into the New World . ( See map , above . ) <p> Curiosity about when these early humans inhabited the area , when they moved on in search of better conditions , and how many generations it may have taken for the descendants of early Siberians to arrive in the American West , led Fitzhugh and his team of scientists on this expedition to traverse thousands of miles of dramatic Siberian landscape in two small Russian bi-planes en route to the Bering Strait . ( See story , right . ) <p> The plan was to retrace the steps of the landmark Morris K. Jesup expedition sponsored by the American Museum of Natural History 100 years ago , the first major visit by Western scientists to northeastern Siberia - and the last , until now . <p> Fitzhugh 's group decided to barnstorm across Siberia , stopping wherever something looked interesting : perhaps to visit with nomadic reindeer herders on the move with their animals , or to check out a remote island off the Arctic coast . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and studying the Arctic - everywhere , that is , except the Siberian Arctic . So the chance to travel through this once-forbidden region seemed ideal , given the new openness of Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union . <p> But the trip was not an easy one . While the versatile planes could provide great access geographically , they could do nothing about endless quarrels with petty bureaucrats over landing fees and rights at small regional airports . In the end , the route itself proved haphazard because of constraints imposed by unpredictable weather and the availability of fuel . <p> Nonetheless , the members of the group felt the opportunity to visit many remote but archaeologically significant places was worth the effort . In addition to Fitzhugh , others on the team included Steven Young , director of the Center for Northern Studies in Wolcott , Vt. ; retired anthropologist Ted Carpenter and his wife , photographer Adelaide de Menil , of New York ; London-based banker and Arctic adventurer Peter de Roos ; and Andrei Golovniev , a Rus- sian ethnologist and filmmaker . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate student and Alutiiq native of Kodiak Island , Alaska , who is currently conducting field work with Fitzhugh among reindeer-herding peoples in a remote corner of northwestern Siberia . A team of journalists rounded out the group , trying another first : to send out weekly reports on the expedition 's progress via satellite telephone to Discovery Television 's new Internet Website . <p> Uncharted territory <p> The journey began in the city of Yakutsk , capital of the semiautonomous Sakha Republic , an area larger than western Europe located entirely within Siberia . It is here that Fitzhugh and other scientists believe the ancestors of early Americans originated . " Much of this region remains virtually unknown , especially its archaeology , " says the tall , soft-spoken Fitzhugh . " This area is where you still find traditional cultures ranging from reindeer herders to hunters , as well as the roots of the earliest peoples of the New World . Our objective was to try to answer some of the many questions we have about the area , as well as lay the groundwork for future projects here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have crossed into Alaska between 12,000 and 15,000 years ago in what many researchers now believe was a series of migrations over a long period of time . For foreign specialists , access to the region may help fill some gaps in what is known about the early cultures . <p> The first archaeological site visited by the team was Kulati , site of the first major excavation undertaken more than 50 years ago by the " grandfather " of Siberian archaeology , Alexei Okladnikov . He uncovered evidence of human habitation stretching back into the Stone Age . Even today , flints , arrowheads , and other remains are visible on top of mounds of dirt , now mostly covered with grass . <p> " These here are flint flakes and pieces of pottery , " says Mr. Haakanson , who , like Fitzhugh , had just arrived from a month of fieldwork elsewhere in Siberia . Throughout the journey , Haakanson shared his insight into what the team was observing ; in turn , the trip gave him an opportunity to dig a little deeper into his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given me a new perspective on my origins , " he says . " It 's been especially helpful to meet the native peoples of Siberia . They 've been very receptive . " <p> Haakanson hails from the tiny village of Old Harbor in the southern part of Kodiak Island , best-known for its huge brown bears . Not far from the village is the site of the first Russian Orthodox settlement in the Americas . Haakanson 's long-term plans are to document thoroughly the history of his people , including preserving their language , which is in danger of dying out . <p> For Haakanson , the trip yielded intriguing hints of ties that might have reached across the Bering Strait . He found similarities to his Alaskan home in the Siberian camp of an elderly Yakut man named Vasily Posnikov , who spends his days whittling heads for duck decoys and preparing fish in a small smokehouse to supply him through the winter . The camp is about about an hour by boat upriver from the town of Belaya Gora above the Arctic Circle . <p> Mr. Posnikov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nearby are several teepee-like structures for storage , as well as the smokehouse . Soon after the researchers ' arrival , Posnikov threw new wood on his outdoor fire . " This fire protects you here , it will make the wolves stay away , " the elderly man said . He talked slowly , evenly , often pausing to mutter " eh-heh , " mannerisms , Fitzhugh noted , that are very similar to those of Eskimos across the Bering Strait , over 1,000 miles to the east . <p> As the group traveled north from Posnikov 's camp , the vegetation changed from thick evergreen forest to barren Arctic tundra , harsh terrain where only sturdy little plants and lichens are able to survive winters with typical temperatures of around minus 60 degrees C ( minus 76 degrees F ) . <p> In some areas this delicate ecosystem is being damaged . Near the Arctic coast the effects of gold mining along riverbeds were clearly visible . Of special concern to Fitzhugh was evidence that some archaeological sites are being plundered by people who sell artifacts on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the line in Russia was near the Bering Strait in the town of Provideniya , named by 19th-century English whalers who found refuge in its well-protected harbor during a long , cold winter . Today , the town is a depressing legacy of the Soviet era , its skyline dominated by a coal-powered energy plant constantly spewing smoke . <p> Yet the team visited several sites in the surrounding inlets that had been inhabited in earlier ages . One has myriad grass-covered pits lined with rocks , where early inhabitants once stored meat and other provisions . Another remarkable site in the area was an early settlement the team chanced upon in a different inlet . <p> " Here we have a housing settlement which probably dates back 500 to 1,500 years , " Fitzhugh said , standing next to a circle of lichen-covered rocks . " All around here are food cache pits for meat , fish , whale blubber , all essentials those early dwellers needed to make it through the long , dark winters . " <p> As at many other locations , Fitzhugh had applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounds that might have served as foundations for houses or lookouts for hunters . <p> In the end , the expedition offered an introduction to a key area rather than direct answers to age-old questions . Yet Fitzhugh says that with this overview , he has a better idea of where to explore in the future . Even before the expedition was over , he was making plans to return this summer to remote Wrangel Island off the northeastern coast of Siberia . There , Russian scientists have found mammoth bones dating to about 3,500 years ago , a discovery that has countered the long-held belief that mammoths died out at least 10,000 years ago . <p> As for Haakanson , this spring will find him back among the reindeer-herding Nenets people in northwestern Siberia , travelling with them as they migrate north with the herds towards the green pastures of summer .
