<p> When it came to directing " Tin Cup " " in Houston , Ron Shelton had no problem . <p> Scenes requiring thousands of extras ? Piece of cake . <p> Access to coveted golf courses ? In the bag . <p> Late-fall weather representing June ? A little cold , maybe , but sunny skies and clear sailing ahead . <p> Nope , Houston did n't add a single snag to the second half of Tin Cup 's 13-week shoot , which wrapped here this week . <p> Shelton said they never lost a day to the weather . <p> Rather , it was that pesky subject - professional golf . <p> How could Shelton , who co-wrote the script with John Norville , use 5-irons and tee times to spark a romantic comedy starring Kevin Costner ? <p> It was n't easy , he said . In fact , if Tin Cup is a hit " " and they ( the studio chiefs ) want a sequel , they 'll have to get somebody else to do it . <p> " " Golf is an impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a long cigar on a north Houston set during a recent day 's filming . <p> With golf tournaments , " " you 've got 120 golfers playing on a stage that 's 150 acres , and nobody knows who 's winning unless you 're watching TV , " the director said . " " And the action is repeated in pretty much the same way , because most golf swings look the same unless you 're an expert . " <p> Shelton did n't even have the luxury of studying classic golf films . There are n't any . <p> " " There 's Follow the Sun ( 1951 ) , the Ben Hogan story , which is kitsch at best , " he said . " " It is unbearably laughable . And Caddyshack is n't really a golf movie . <p> So there 's nothing . We started from scratch . " <p> Also challenging was golf 's nature as " " a cerebral game , an internal game . You 've got ta get inside guys ' heads . How do we make it sexy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sell the game . Sell the people who play it . <p> " " Look at ( golf pro ) Lee Trevino , " Shelton said . " " What a character he is . Guys like him prove that an Everyman can win big tournaments often enough to keep that blind American hope alive . " <p> Tin Cup 's main character is another Everyman . He 's Roy " " Tin Cup " McAvoy ( Costner ) , a talented but complacent golfer who runs a West Texas driving range . ( Those scenes were filmed earlier near Tucson , Ariz . ) <p> When McAvoy falls for a lovely psychologist ( Rene Russo ) , he vows to compete for her affections against a rival ( Don Johnson ) in the U.S. Open . Cheech Marin plays McAvoy 's faithful caddie , Romeo . <p> The climatic U.S. Open scenes were shot at new Deerwood and Kingwood courses , representing the fictional Pine Hills Country Club in North Carolina . <p> On this day , Costner and Marin pull up in a dirty , dingy Winnebago to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film on a remote , tree-lined stretch of road just north of FM 1960 . <p> By mistake , McAvoy 's name has been left off the qualifying list , and there 's a testy scene as the men try to gain entry . <p> Departure for Costner <p> This film is a departure for Costner , says Shelton , who shared breakout success with him in 1987 's baseball-themed romantic comedy , Bull Durham , Shelton 's first film as writer-director . <p> " " Kevin is doing things he has n't done for a while as an actor , " Shelton said . <p> " " He 's loose , he 's relaxed , he 's free and there 's not an arch note in his performance . He 's self-effacing and not afraid to let his character make a fool of himself . " <p> Shelton and Norville are golfing buddies who got the idea for the film while on the links . They wrote their title role with Costner in mind . <p> Yet the actor was not an avid golfer , Norville said . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off as a guy capable of playing in the Open . " <p> So they hired golf pro and CBS golf analyst Gary McCord to coach Costner . ( McCord also advised Shelton on golf-tour accuracy . ) " " Kevin 's a real good athlete , so he 's been able to pull it off , " Norville said . " " We have n't used any doubles . " <p> The other trick is the personality . <p> Unlike his dour , taciturn characters in Waterworld and Wyatt Earp , Costner 's Tin Cup golfer " " is a guy who talks too much , who drives you crazy , who 's always got a beer in his hand and is shooting himself in the foot , " Shelton said . <p> " " People are going to be surprised how funny Kevin is . I think he has a gift for light comedy that he touched on in Silverado and Bull Durham . It 's both a new and an old Kevin they 're going to see . " <p> Sticking to sports <p> In some ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1989 's Blaze , about Louisiana politico Earl Long , the writer-director has stuck to sports films , including 1992 's White Men Ca n't Jump , about basketball , and last year 's Cobb , about baseball . <p> " " I never think of them as sports stories , though , " Shelton said . " " They 're character-driven and have a view of our life and times and the American experience . <p> " " To me , sports is a stage , an arena , the way the mythic Old West was an arena for various kinds of stories . So I think of it as a world I 'm mining rather than a sports story . " Golf is a challenge , since it lacks " " the built-in dramatic territorial structures of most sports , " he said . <p> " " In White Men Ca n't Jump , we had the energy and choreography and irreverence of the trash talk - the ballet and street wisdom of the whole thing . And with baseball you have a slow , wonderful pace lending itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only a drive and an iron and a putt . But there 's also a lore and an obsession with the game that fascinates me . " Still , Shelton is aware that many people who do n't play golf " " hate the game . " <p> " " But there 's something special and maddening about it . I wanted to tap into that through a guy who is wildly gifted and wildly self-destructive , showing how and if he comes to terms with his demons and grows up . " The challenge of making golf a sexy subject put the other details in perspective - such as casting thousands of extras to play tour spectators and officials . <p> " " This has been the best group of extras we 've ever seen , " Shelton said of the 8,000 Houstonians who worked for long hours in key scenes . <p> " " I do n't know if it 's just because they have n't ever done this and so they 're still eager - it 's pretty boring work - or if they 're golf fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've been attentive , not obnoxious , and few have given me scripts to read . This has been a great location for us - a very film-friendly place . " <p> Paying thousands of extras $ 50 a day took a sizable chunk out of the film 's budget , which Shelton estimates as being more than $ 30 million , including Costner 's star salary . <p> " " Movies used to be able to give away waffle irons and things to get people as extras , but not now , " he said . " " You have to own your extras . " <p> Since coming here from Tucson in early November , the production has worked six-day weeks , taking off only on Sundays and for a four-day break at Thanksgiving . <p> Indeed , cast and crew have had scant time to indulge , though Shelton visited the Rothko Chapel , he and Costner have attended Houston Rockets games and the actor met with former President Bush . <p> Now that they 're done , Shelton heads back to Los Angeles to edit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next summer . <p> Next he hopes to direct " " a love story that 's about three-fourths written - with no sports in it . I 've also got a boxing story I want to do , really low-budget and down and dirty . <p> " " Two guys in a ring has got to be easier than 4,000 people and a guy shooting a 2-iron . " As for Tin Cup , he figures it 's got a good chance to restore Costner 's commercial fortunes after the troubled waters of Waterworld , A Perfect World and Wyatt Earp . <p> " " I do n't worry about his career , though - I just worry about my own , " Shelton said . " " But I 've got a pretty good batting average , and so does he . <p> " " Hopefully , this will be smart and funny and earthy - and , yeah , commercial . You 're always trying to find an audience . I was trying to find an audience with Cobb , and nothing was less commercial than that . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun ride down a road people might not take otherwise . You may hate golf , but when one of these guys hits a ball in the water , you 'll feel like you hit the ball in the water , too . "
