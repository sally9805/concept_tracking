<p> Dr. John Nelson was appalled when his partner returned from a free Caribbean vacation and promptly switched patients to a drug made by the trip 's sponsor . <p> His partner , he believed , was not acting in the best interest of his patients . There was no proof the new , more expensive drug was as effective as the one it was replacing . <p> " It appeared that a drug of questionable effectiveness and great expense would now be used , perhaps to the detriment of patients , because of an expensive incentive to a physician , " says Nelson , a Salt Lake City obstetrician . <p> Nelson is n't alone in his concern over drug companies enticing doctors to prescribe their products with lavish gifts . <p> Since congressional hearings two weeks ago on the promotional practices of the drug industry , the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee has received a flood of calls from outraged consumers and doctors . <p> " Every family is affected by this - we all have parents and children who get prescription drugs , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings . " We are outraged by the costs and worried about whether we 're getting the most appropriate prescription . " <p> Kennedy 's committee has asked the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and the American Medical Association to detail by February how they 'll act more responsibly . <p> One step already has been taken . One week before the hearings , the AMA adopted its first formal ethical guidelines on gift-taking : Doctors may accept gifts that benefit patients directly or indirectly , such as free samples of drugs and discounted seminar fees , but they may not accept cash , trips , airline tickets or merchandise . <p> The AMA 's Dr. Daniel Johnson Jr . says most doctors are so troubled by the recent charges that they 'll abide by the guidelines to avoid any suggestion of impropriety . Peer pressure , he insists , will ensure perks practices " change overnight . " <p> Kennedy is n't so sure : " The guidelines are meaningless without enforcement . " <p> He says hearings nearly 20 years ago focused on the same issues . " Promises were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the history of these groups , that the guidelines will never bear fruit . " <p> Enforcing doctors ' ethics is the responsibility of state and county medical boards . <p> Ultimately , says Kennedy , the Food and Drug Administration may need to regulate drug company promotions more closely , with civil penalties established for companies and doctors who break FDA rules . <p> Although drug company promotions have been sporadically called into question for decades , the level of activity , value of the enticements and the impact on prescribing practices have swelled in recent years . <p> It has become common for doctors to accept lavish gifts such as vacations , says Nelson . Even more common are the trinkets many now expect . <p> " I have received any number of gimmicks to remind me to use a specific drug : golf balls with the company logo , pens , pencils , note pads , mugs ... tickets to shows , dinners , golf fees , tennis balls and cash . There are many , many more . " <p> Such practices , says Dr. Nichole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insidious impact on ( doctors ' ) behavior . " <p> Testimony by doctors , pharmacists and former drug industry executives suggests that : <p> - Gift-giving by companies and gift-taking by doctors are widespread . Dr. Sidney Wolfe , director of the consumer group Public Citizen , says up to 185,000 doctors attended free drug company dinners last year at which they received $ 100 each just for showing up . After dinner , company representatives discuss new drugs . <p> - The objectivity of doctors who accept gifts is questionable . Kennedy says drug companies spent $ 165 million in 1988 on trips , dinners and gifts for doctors . Critics argue that the companies would not spend the money if it did n't influence prescribing habits . <p> - Patients pay higher prices for their medicine as a result of drug company promotions totaling $ 5 billion a year . An Office of Technology Assessment study , due in March , will show how much of the cost is passed on to patients through higher drug prices . <p> But the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association says dinners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they often meet requirements for continuing medical education credits . <p> " Physicians must be adequately informed about the availability of an important new therapy and current about its uses or the patient will be poorly served , " says PMA president Gerald Mossinghoff . The PMA provided the only testimony on behalf of the drug industry ; individual companies refused to testify . <p> " Physicians are often confronted with a choice of six , eight or even 12 different drugs with similar safety , effectiveness and cost , " says the AMA 's Johnson . " Promotional efforts to influence a physician to use brand A versus brand B to accomplish the same objective pose no threat to any patient . " <p> But Wolfe insists gift-giving is simple bribery and that gift-taking by doctors is " white-coated , white-collar crime . " <p> Wolfe set up a " doctor-bribing hot line , " this year for reporting dubious offers from drug companies . Among calls : <p> - One company offered doctors 1,000 points toward a free ticket ( 50,000 points ) on American Airlines for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discontinued after a Massachusetts criminal investigation . - <p> - Office computer equipment worth $ 35,000 was offered by a consortium of 10 drug companies to doctors in exchange for watching up to 32 drug commercials a month , and for using a hardware and software package that allows drug companies to monitor the doctor 's prescribing practices . <p> Such enticements , says Lurie , who conducted a study at seven Midwest teaching hospitals , inarguably influence prescribing habits . Findings : - <p> - 25% of faculty doctors and 33% of residents had changed their practices at least once in the past year based on a conversation with a drug rep . <p> - 20% of the faculty and 4% of residents recommended that the hospital pharmacy buy a new drug based on the suggestion of a drug rep . <p> - Most doctors said a gift of more than $ 100 might compromise their objectivity . <p> " All of this is problematic for two reasons , " says Lurie . " First it adds to the cost of health care . Second , it leads physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly more expensive drugs . " <p> But the AMA is furious over suggestions of widespread wrongdoing . <p> While acknowledging that drug companies are exerting more pressure ,  --  Johnson maintains " there is a significant hunk of doctors hurt by the allegations . " <p> The PMA , meanwhile , will follow the AMA 's standards so that promotion is conducted responsibly , says Mossinghoff . <p> Says Kennedy : " I think the principle question is whether the pharmaceutical industry and the medical profession can heal themselves or whether additional regulations are needed . We will wait and see . "
