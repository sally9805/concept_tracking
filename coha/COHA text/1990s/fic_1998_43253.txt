after Natalia Ginzburg Headnote " The following essay , He and I , " captures the seesaw of human companionship and love with a patience and sensitivity to interconnectedness that it is hard to imagine a male essayist attempting , much less equaling. " - Phillip Lopate <p> She is quintessentially French . I am , in the loosest sense of the word , American . She always feels cold . I am always hot . In the winter , even if it is n't chilly , she does nothing but complain about how cold it is . Even in late spring , there are large , fertile fields of goose bumps on her thin , beautiful arms , and I have known her , even in the Middle East in late June , to wear a woolen sweater around the house , to sleep in a lamb 's wool camisole in August . She speaks , since she does n't speak much , only one language well , though she seems to understand so much more than I do , even in the languages she does n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make myself understood in several languages , yet have trouble focusing on the conversations of others . She enjoys reading maps and navigating around in new places . I hate it , and quickly grow impatient and ornery . After a single afternoon in a foreign city , she will have mastered the public transportation system , be able to find her way to the centrum from the most desolate-seeming corners . I will get lost five meters from my own hotel , or-worse yet-a new apartment . She hates asking for directions , preferring to gaze patiently at an ( to me ) indecipherable map for many moments . When we get lost , I am quick to blame her . She blames no one , but busies herself looking for secondhand shops and fruit and vegetable markets in whatever neighborhood we are lost in . She loves old architecture , curved surfaces , rummaging among the trinkets and memorabilia of other people 's lives at flea markets , the scent of flowers and herbs . I am always impatient to get where I 'm going , missing virtually everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been able to love completely and unconditionally are my own disfigured face in the mirror and sitting at my desk making a kind of music exclusively with words . . . though I love my son , and sometimes her , in a different way , as well . She loves travel , unfamiliar places , a sense of the unexpected . I dream of living always in one place , burning my passport , etching an address in stone upon my doorpost , running for mayor in some town I will never again move from . I love to eat in restaurants-bad restaurants , good restaurants , even mediocre ones . She always wants to eat at home : fresh vegetables and better food , she claims , at one-fifth the price . She hates the way I do the dishes and leave a mess after cooking . I like , on occasion , to do the dishes and cook , though I 'm quite awful at the former , which I always do in too great a hurry , leaving all sorts of prints , smudges , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a late movie-preferably a slow-moving , melancholic one of the French or Italian sort-and to have a glass of wine or two with dinner . I prefer rather superficial , fast-moving American films , fall asleep almost the second I enter the theater for anything later than the 7:30 showing , and can drink , at most , a glass of white zinfandel in late afternoon . She has little patience for , or interest in , pleasantries among strangers , preferring to restrict her circle of acquaintances to those she is truly intimate with . I enjoy talking to the garbage collector , the mailman , making small talk with the meter reader and taxi driver . The greetings " How are you ? " and " Have a nice day " do not cause me to rail against the superficiality of America and Americans . She is shy ; I am not . Occasionally , however , her shyness rubs off on me , or , alternatively-as in the case of landlords who are trying to take advantage of us or rabbis who are too adamantly in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in English , her vocabulary suddenly expanding to include words like " barbaric " and " philistine . " She has no respect for established authority , and thinks nothing of running out on student loans , disconnecting the electric meter , or not paying taxes . I , on the other hand , though I have the face of an anarchist , am afraid of established authority and tend , against my own better instincts , to respect it . As soon as I spot a police car in the rearview mirror , I assume I have done something terribly wrong and begin to contemplate spending the rest of my life in jail . She , on the other hand , smiles shyly at the police officer , who quickly folds up his notebook and goes back to his car . She likes goat 's cheese , garlic , a good slice of pate with a glass of red wine , tomatoes with fresh rosemary . I like sausages , raw meat , pizza , and gefilte fish with very sharp horseradish . She claims that I am a Neanderthal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will die young of high cholesterol , rancid oils , and pesticides . She is refined , has a sensitive palate and a nose so accurate it can tell the difference between day-old and two-day-old butter . When we lived in Cambridge , Massachusetts , she spent many days in search of the perfect , vine-ripened tomato and just the right kind of basil for making pesto . She ca n't stand , for example , pine nuts that are rancid . " Rancid , " in fact , is one of the English words she uses most frequently . At the cinema she hates to sit too close to the screen , and-if we 're at home-refuses to watch movies on TV that are interrupted by commercials , claiming that it interferes with her " dream world . " I like to sit near the front of the theater and tell jokes during the movie . I like almost any movie , as long as it is superficial enough not to disturb my worldview . She prefers dark , slow-moving , romantic tragedies , set to the music of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after , causing her to question , or reexamine , almost everything in her world . She remembers the names of films and actors , and prefers actresses who embody a kind of low-key sensuality and dark reserve . I adore those who are brazenly sexual and whore-like in their demeanor . If , for example , as in Roman Polanski 's Bitter Moon , there are two women , one of whom is subtly beautiful , sensual , and slightly tragic , the other who is vulgar , brazen , hedonistic , and rather shallow , it is always certain that she will prefer the first . I always prefer the second . On those rare occasions when we 've seen a film we both liked , she will , the next day-even the next month-remember every small detail of it : the weather in a particular scene , the shape of an awning , the way a blouse or a cloth napkin lay against the protagonist 's arm or lap . I , on the other hand , will remember nothing , not even the plot , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . Somewhat sheep-faced , I will ask her to remind me what the movie was about , who was in it . . . on occasion , even , what its name was , all.of which she will generously do , never even pausing to comment upon my infirmity . Though I am rather smart about books and literature , it is the rare film in which I am even able to follow the plot line , much less unravel the mystery , so that , after we leave the theater ( assuming I have n't fallen asleep ) , I will usually need her to explain to me exactly what happened , who was related to whom , and why , at the end , a photograph of one character 's daughter mysteriously showed up on the wall of a seemingly unrelated character 's living room . When she does , I am inevitably embarrassed about my simple-mindedness and lack of insight , a shortcoming she seems either oblivious to or willing to overlook . I either love or hate people , and find myself utterly incapable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She , though often equally indifferent to the same people , always seeks to find something interesting and unique about them , a pursuit I have neither the time nor patience for . Something in even the most uninspiring of persons arouses , if not her conversation , then at least her curiosity , and-once she has been engaged with someone in any way-she retains a certain ongoing loyalty to them I can neither relate to or comprehend . Though far less extroverted than I am , she will carry on a correspondence with any number of people , in all sorts of countries , and keeps a list in her address book of all the birthdays of everyone she has ever known and liked . I consider every crisis a catastrophe , and will begin to fidget nervously and despondently whenever I am confronted with a late train , a rescheduled flight , or an incompetent waitperson . She considers each of these events a hidden opportunity , a portent from the gods , yet another manifestation of the world 's independence and revivifying fickleness . Though I have somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am extremely lazy . My favorite activity , as Freud said of poets , is daydreaming , my buttocks wedged firmly in a chair . She is never idle , raising domesticity to an art form , a Buddhistic perfection in every ironed crease . Being a devotee of Bishop Berkeley 's formulation to the effect that , if you ca n't see it , it is n't there , I prefer neatness to cleanliness . My idea of housecleaning is to sweep the large dustballs under the bed , stuff plastic and paper bags sloppily into a kitchen cabinet , cover the bed hurriedly with a creased down comforter , cram my underwear ( freely mingling the soiled and the dean ) into a dresser drawer . She is almost maniacally clean , sniffing each of my shirts and socks daily to make sure they do n't need to be washed , vacuuming in corners , changing the pillowcases and sheets with the regularity of tides . I like to buy cheap things , particularly clothes , frequently wearing them once or twice until they fray in the washer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to place without ever wearing them again . One of the things she seems to enjoy most is to go through my clothes closets , reminding me of all the cheap items I bought and never wore , or which I have worn once , washed , and which are now " totally out of shape . " She buys clothes almost never , but always things of good quality , preferring to wear the same few things ( always immaculately dean ) time and time again . I fancy myself a great dancer and a sex object . She thinks of herself as physically awkward and more sensual than sexy . I can type like a madman and , albeit reluctantly , use a computer . She considers a keyboard a postmodern artifact . I like to drive . She likes to navigate . On those few occasions on which she drives our car , I nag her relentlessly about shifting at the wrong speeds , or squeezing too hard on the brakes . When she navigates and we begin to lose our way , I immediately become so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Budapest , she threatened to get out of the car and go home on her own . In countries known for their dangerous drivers , she insists I do all the driving , an affirmation of my manhood I accept reluctantly , though I do n't object to being in control . I am the kind of person who can do many things at once , most of them rather middlingly . She does only one thing at a time , but always with a sense of perfection . I like to cook without recipes , freely mixing Marsala wine , mustard , artichoke hearts , candied ginger , maple syrup , and plums , hoping something capable of being digested will emerge . She always uses a recipe-except for things she has made before-but everything she makes is successful and delicious . I would have been a rock star , or a concert pianist-or perhaps , even , the proprietor of an illicit sex club-had I felt freer to follow my lyrical and immoral heart 's calling . She would have been a sister in a Carmelite monastery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . I am a reluctant , though not unsuccessful , father . She could have been many things , all of them having something to do with taking care of others or using her hands : a nurse , a dentist , a carpenter , a potter , a refinisher of furniture , a restorer of antiquarian books . I , though I like to imagine otherwise , could probably have done only the one thing I am doing now : putting words to paper . I like to live part of my life in the if but only mode of wishful thinking and fantastical alternatives . She accepts the life that life has given her as her one possible destiny , without complaining . She does n't like to think of money-in fact , her refusal to think about it has , on occasion , gotten us into trouble . I , while I do n't like to think of it either , am usually left with the unpoetic task of having to worry about it . Since I have been with her , in fact , hardly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . almost constantly . She , on the other hand , worries about many other unpoetic tasks in our lives which have nothing at all to do with money . I can imitate people from many countries , and with many different accents . She is too much herself to imitate anyone . I like to have some kind of music playing whenever I am not reading or working . She usually prefers silence , or only to have music on when she is actually listening to it . I will continue to eat even when I am no longer hungry , just for the pleasure of it . She eats only as much as satisfies her hunger on any occasion . I abhor all forms of table manners , eating with my fingers , chewing with my mouth open , taking food freely from others " plates , licking my fingers at the table , stuffing my mouth with large quantities , burping and passing gas . She never eats before being seated at the table , waits for everyone else to do likewise , chews only small morsels at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such deliberate pleasure , that I have usually finished what is on my plate well before she is actually seated . Only twice in our eight years together have I observed her passing gas . Burping , never . As soon as I make a decision , I immediately , and relentlessly , tilt towards wanting the other alternative . She immediately accepts , and begins to implement , any decision she has made . She often says that I am a neurotic and " special " kind of person , that she feels that , living with me , this kind of behavior is the " statue quo . " Occasionally , when I am in one of my periods of manic reconsideration , she smiles slightly in her slightly smiling French way , as if to say , " Oy vey , what a case I am married to . " I like to eat on the street-frequently , and mostly greasy and unhealthy foods-which accounts for the fact that most of my clothes have grease and/or coffee stains on them , souvenirs of my animalistic habits she claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , I like to devour greasy Hungarian sausages at stand-up counters in Budapest . She likes to eat only " atable , " quietly , savoring every morsel of , say , pate with , preferably , a glass of red wine . Among the tastes in life I can truly not abide are pasteque , fennel , and every form of anise , all of which she has rather an affection for . I am often angry at others , friends , foes , and family alike , and like to hold , and nurse , these angers for as long as is humanly possible , until I can almost feel them eating at my liver , like an earthquake with numerous , sustained aftershocks . She is incapable of sustained anger or hostility and would , I believe ( perhaps already has ) , forgive me the most egregious deeds and betrayals , an attitude I have no desire to test to its limits . Even in her case , I like to remind her as often as possible of the ways she has disappointed and betrayed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my betrayals and weaknesses . I never cry , even when I am truly unhappy , yet I have a tendency to grow teary-eyed whenever an athlete experiences some major triumph , or after the last out of the World Series , when the players all rush to the mound and hug each other . She cries easily , even at sentimental movies whose pandering to sentimental feelings she despises . I will take any kind of pill or medicine anyone recommends in order to relieve pain and discomfort . She prefers " natural " remedies . Although I am not terribly Jewish by religious conviction , I wanted to have our son circumcised when he was born . She felt it to be a pagan ritual tantamount to permanent disfigurement , and began assembling propaganda from various anti-circumcision organizations around the country which depicted vast armadas of mutilated children with heavily bandaged penises . She won . . . she usually wins . I think she is beautiful , but too thin , and am constantly after her to try and gain weight . She thinks she is less beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful arms . " When she was younger , in California , she wore her hair very short and looked like a kind of postmodern French punktress on her way to the wrong discotheque . Now , I think , she is much more beautiful and womanly , and , like I am , a bit older . When we met in Ecuador , she had rather gray hair and was wearing purple nylon pants and a yellow sweatshirt . She seemed , at first , more interested in reading her mail than in talking to me , a fact which I soon realized was due more to her shyness-and her passion for her mail-than to lack of interest in me . On the two-hour bus ride between Quito and Otavalo , across the equator , I slowly began to realize that she was quite beautiful , in an undemonstrative sort of way , and that night , as a way of getting myself into her room and closer to her bed in the hotel where she , her female traveling companion , and I were staying , I planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered , as shy as she seemed , and it turned out I did n't need to do that . The next morning I remember her companion bringing two glasses of fresh-squeezed orange juice to the room , along with coffee , and then our walking , hand in hand , above the town of Otavalo , where we finally sat in a small restaurant and her friend , Annick , took our picture . I looked very happy in the photo , though not too handsome . She looked happy , too , and quite lovely . We stayed in several very lovely , and inexpensive , small Ecuadorian hotels during those days , and I remember , not even a week after not having to borrow her toothpaste , looking down at her one night ( or was it afternoon ? ) and saying , " I think I love you . " " I think I love you , too , Gringo , " she replied . She used to call me " Gringo " in those days . I remember talking to her an awful lot back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassionately , she always listened . I myself am not such a good listener , except on occasion , so that-along with the sweet way she always said " uh-huh , uhhuh. : " and " yes . . . yes " when I was telling her a story-it made a real impression on me . Back then , I do n't remember her being nearly as cold , or quite as thin . . . but , then again , we were in love and in Ecuador . Sometimes , now , when I realize we have been together for more than eight years and have a seven-year-old son , I think that this is one of the major miracles of my life . . . and I 'm sure she does also . I was so romantic then , that night in Otavalo , and so was she when , hardly a week later , she got on a plane from Quito to the United States and followed me to Boston . I remember her calling me , as we had planned , but suddenly having a sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me she was standing at a pay telephone across the street at Porter Square , I ran down the stairs , not even bothering to button my shirt or pull up my zipper , and took her into my arms and carried her halfway up to my fourth-floor , rent-controlled apartment . I was stronger in those days , and healthier , and so , maybe , was she . We were not so young , but very much in love , and there was a scent of laundry , somehow , wafting through my windows as we made love , on a mattress located on my study floor , for the first time in the United States of America . Now , as I write this , I am sitting in Israel , and we will soon be in Paris , then in Provence , and then back in the United States of America , the only country whose language I have truly mastered . I no longer live in that rent-controlled apartment , and that mattress , I am quite sure , is no longer on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing eyes and beautiful smile and lovely French voice , and she is still , as a friend of mine once described her , " une chouette " - an owl . Which is a wiser , more deliberate animal than a fly .
