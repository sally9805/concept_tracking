Here it was , the Main Event . We had rounded up the USA 's three premier , me-first , deee-luxe full-size pickup trucks . Now we 'd test them to within an inch of their warranties , and may the baddest dog win . For the purpose of our test , and because upcountry driving demands nothing less , all three trucks were 4x4s . However , aside from having four drive wheels , each had its own distinct character . The Ford F150 and Chevy K1500 were powered by midline V-8s  --  a 5.8-liter ( 351 CID ) in the Ford and a 5.7-liter ( 350 CID ) in the Chevy . Both also had four-speed automatic transmissions . The Dodge Ram was the iconoclast in the engine room . Instead of supplying us with a 4x4 powered by the midsize Dodge Magnum ( 5.9-liter ) V-8 ( 360 CID ) , we got a small-block 5.2-liter Magnum V-8 ( 318 CID ) . Obviously , the Dodge was going to be a step or two behind in raw power . But making up for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted with a five-speed stick . Fine with us . In this age of increasingly efficient automatics , we wondered just how much performance a stick shift was still good for . But making this small-block/stick work even harder , our Dodge was a Club Cab , weighing 400 pounds more than the conventional-cab Ram . Let the games begin . Chevrolet K1500 Fleetside Z71 Off-Road 4x4 Not surprisingly , Chevy , Ford , and Dodge have reached a broad consensus on what features and amenities the well-dressed full-size pickup should offer . Let 's deal with the important stuff first-all three have vanity mirrors on the passenger side only . If you 're concerned about your eye shadow , you do n't fit the job description for " Driver , pickup , full-size . " Glad that 's behind us . To business . The Chevy K1500 cabin is comfortable and well laid out . To shift the transfer box , Chevy 's floor-mounted , bright orange Power Trac light show tells you whether you 're in 2Hi , 4Hi , Neutral , or 4Lo . This shifter is electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object to the hesitation that can occur between shifting the lever and actual engagement of the transfer case . The Chevy also features four-wheel ABS . Like the other two trucks , the Chevy has high-quality cloth upholstery , which allows it to be washed , say , after a successful hunting trip . And like the Ford , our Chevy has mechanical seat adjustments and a useful power lumbar adjustment . The bench seats are split 2/1 , and the middle section of the seat back can be folded down to provide a center workstation . This is similar to the Dodge 's pioneering fold-down workstation , with a difference . The Chevy 's has no compartments or organizers . All Chevy does is provide a cushioned elbow rest , which seems a lot of effort for not much payoff . Behind the Chevy 's seat , however , is a closed box containing the jack and a tray for odds and ends . Like the other entrants , the Chevy 's instrumentation is complete , featuring a legible white-on-black speedometer and a half-sweep tachometer , as ell as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauge . The tach is redlined at 4,500 rpm , with the caution zone beginning at 4,000 rpm . The K1500 's dashboard controls are common to all 1995 Chevrolet trucks and an appreciated improvement over the push-button , digital clutter in GM trucks for so long . The HVAC ( **28;158;TOOLONG ) controls are sensible knobs , offering immediate , accurate adjustment . Ditto the AM/FM/cassette . A convenient " Auto Tone " selector automatically configures equalization to best receive news , rock , pop , jazz , or classical music . Nice . Our one complaint with the controls was the overcomplicated turn-signal stalk on the left of the steering column . It has little buttons and levers and dials controlling the turn signals , the windshield wipers , the windshield washers ... even the three modes of Chevrolet 's cruise control . Faithful GMC-Chevy drivers are no doubt used to all this busyness , but the steering hub-mounted cruise controls on the Dodge and Ford are not only easier to use , they offer additional cruise-control commands the Chevy stalk has n't room for . To confirm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rivals ' sales brochures-our 271 had no fewer than four cup holders , two in a pull-out cluster and two in the dash tray . It also offered three dashboard power takeoffs , one doubling as the cigarette lighter  --  the Ford and Dodge have two power takeoffs each . But all three trucks feature power windows , mirrors , and locks . The Chevy and Ford also have remote keyless entry . The Z71 has a fine bed-liner that protects the cap as well as the bed 's interior , but the Chevy short bed has no conventional tie-downs . Instead , it is supplied with stake pockets at each corner , to which cargo can be tied off and stabilized . Lift-over height to the 4x4 's bed is 32.35 inches . There are rear cargo lights and a sliding rear window , and the Chevy also has a trailer hitch with a maximum weight of 4,000 pounds and maximum tongue weight of 400 pounds . Ford 150 Flareside 4x4 The F-150 Flareside is a compact , all-business package  --  in overall appearance , our favorite . Climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board . Inside , we found a column shifter for the four-speed automatic and Ford 's steel-to-steel transfer-box floor shifter . Trust us , wherever this shift lever is , that 's where the transfer gears are . This honest-John arrangement has obvious advantages , but its disadvantage is that disengaging 4Lo occasionally means coming to a stop and backing out slightly to unload the gear cluster . The Ford 's brakes are two-wheel ABS , rears only . Instrumentation in the Ford is complete , though with some anomalies . There is a 280deg sweep tach , for instance , but no red line . Of course , this may be bemuse with an electronic automatic , you ca n't over-rev the engine . Still , odd . The Ford 's thick , sturdy leather steering wheel contains the cruise-control switches , and these could n't be easier to use . By contrast , the Ford radio could n't be harder to use . Everything is push-button and digital , and if you 're driving along a rough back road  --  as you very likely will be in this truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chances of hitting what you aim at are only 50-50  --  and that 's just the start of the trouble . If you hit the wrong button , you now have two " right " buttons to hit . Not good . On the positive side , this deck has a CD player and a very pleasant sound , once its ducks are all in a row . Power controls for the mirrors , windows , and locks are on a tower inside the door . The seat is a 1-1-1 , with a small bucket seat as the center unit . Seat adjustments are mechanical , with the exception of the power lumbar adjustment , a back-saving addition on long driving days . In Ford 's version of the workstation , the fold-down center backrest contains two cup holders and a pop-up container for odds and ends . The interesting thing about this Ford version is , with its lid open , there are still strips of cushion along the sides for you and your passenger to rest an elbow on as you drive . Two cargo-light switches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Chevy 's . The Ford 's lights can be switched on individually . The Ford Flareside 4x4 bed has a lift-over height of 32.35 inches , and four tie-downs are well placed ahead of and behind the wheel well for securing cargo . Dodge Ram 1500 Club Cab Laramie SLT 4x4 If you 've been out of the country for a decade , you may not know that the Dodge Ram is back ... big ! The resulting truck is nothing if not bold  --  either you hate it , or you love it . Well , we 're inclined to like it , and the interior shows why . This cab is utterly huge compared with the others . And as you look around at the instrumentation , you find a crisp , contemporary white-on-black look . Why , they even redlined the tach ! Since this is a five-speed stick , the 2,000 rpm redline really means something hereabouts . Similarly , the HVAC and AM/FM/cassette controls are flawless . Next to the audio deck is a clever pull-out cup holder , and the window , locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Dodge 's side mirrors can be adjusted : With a knob you rotate to select either right or left mirror and then operate like a joystick Two very bright maplights are mounted in the roof and are switched on by simply pushing on their lenses . The well-publicized Ram workstation is the largest and most complex on any of our three trucks , but it lacks the Ford 's cushioned edge . Driving over bumpy roads with the lid up , we kept banging our funnybone on the edge of the open container . Otherwise , this unit is a great convenience , and Dodge has reengineered the lid so that it does n't slam shut as you slow down . The Club Cab is new to Dodge 's line and very impressive for its ample rear seating and immense storage capacity . And for a touch of luxury , our Ram was the only truck equipped with optional six-way power seats . The Ram 's stick shift features a steel-to-steel transfer-box shifter similar to Ford 's . And it matches the Chevy 's four-wheel ABS , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 6-1/2-foot cargo hold we found no fewer than six tie-downs  --  two in the floor at the front corners and four on the sides of the box , one at each corner . Very handy . The Dodge 's lift-over height is 33.9 inches . Hit the Road , Jack Road tests do n't happen in parking lots , so we moved out to get a feel for each of these fancy strutters . In town , it 's amazing how civilized all three are , especially considering that they 're capable of doing really hard work for decades just like their rough-edged forebears . But get them out on the highway , and you 'll find distinctions galore . Because these are working trucks with serious payload ratings , at freeway speeds their suspensions have very definite personalities . Ditto their drivetrains . For instance , the Chevrolet began to lag in responsiveness as we knifed our way through highway traffic . And while the small-block Dodge did n't straggle behind , it was only because we stayed very busy stirring its stick shift around , keeping the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceleration testing . From 0 to 60 miles per hour , the Chevy took 10.6 seconds , while the Ford needed 10.1 . The small-block/stick Dodge did it in 10.0 seconds . That should tell you something about the performance penalty you 're paying driving even an up-to-the-minute automatic . The distinctions were just as clear in our passing tests . To accelerate from 30 to 50 mph , the Chevy took 5.2 seconds and the Ford 5.1 , while the Dodge needed just 3.9 in second gear or 6.2 seconds in third . The Chevy moved from 50 to 70 mph in 7.6 seconds , the Ford needed 6.5 , and the Dodge 6.4 seconds . Obviously , judging by the 30-to-50 time in third gear , the little Dodge is short on low-end torque and must be driven hard to extract its best performance . Given even a slight grade , it had to be downshifted from fifth to fourth to accelerate or pass . Think of fifth as a straight-and-level , high-mileage cruising gear in this truck . But given these caveats , a small-block with a stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not hauling or towing something that casts a long shadow . Other important distinctions surfaced out on the highway . For instance , when we came to a section of concrete highway with closely spaced asphalt seams , the Chevy seemed unaffected and the Ford 's rear wheel began to skip a little . But the Dodge 's ride quality simply fell to pieces . The combination of soft shock rates and chassis flex from the extra-long Club Cab frame combined in the worst way . Far from " soaking up " the rhythmic hopping , the Dodge seemed to magnify it . After this range of responses , we could n't wait to get to the dirt and explore further differences . Down and Dirty Well out of range of pavement , our 4x4s definitely looked ready to do battle . And as the going got rougher , their individual personalities again emerged . In really rough going . the Chevy ZR1 produced a confident , poised ride . The Ford , too , was happy , though its stiffer spring and shock rates gave it a slightly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected would happen , the soft-riding long-chassis Dodge bottomed out . More than that , in deep dust  --  and we 're talkin ' deep it was impossible to move the Dodge from a dead stop without the onset of axle-tramp . The chassis wound up , and as the power impulses came through the driveshaft , the whole structure bean to judder and buck and wheel-hop . We 've driven the regular-cab Ram in similar conditions and never experienced this difficulty . We can only say that if you 're looking to do some serious off-roading and you think the space in a Club Cab might be convenient , it would be wise to take a long off-road test-drive first and judge the tradeoffs for yourself . The Chevy and the Ford , however , could n't have been happier bouncing and bucking over the craters we found until we came to a steep descent . At this point , the Ford-with its rear-wheel ABS and " real " front brakes  --  crept down the face of steep , dusty slopes just as slowly as you please . But coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how hard you tromped the brake pedal , the four-wheel ABS kept cycling and releasing , cycling and releasing , letting you roll forward much faster than the Ford . The reason for the difference is simple enough . The ABS is only interested in whether the wheels are locked up . Sensing they are , the ABS releases the brakes and waits for the next lock-up , ad infinitum . But on this slippery deep dust ( or soft snow ) , it took almost no braking to lock the wheels . Result : the Chevy 's ABS was constantly releasing the brakes just when we wanted them to slow us down . The Dodge had the four-wheel ABS as well but behaved considerably better . The clear winner was the Ford 's non-ABS front brakes . They were more confidence-inspiring in the deep dirt , yet the rear-wheel ABS controlled any tendency to lock the lightly loaded rears and spin in an emergency stop on pavement . When the Dust Settles So how do these three pickups rank ! Put it this way , we would n't kick away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cab  --  even without the Club addition  --  was certainly the roomiest and most comfortable , with the Ford and Chevy in a dead heat for second place . We also gave the Dodge a slight lead for its controls and ergonomics , although one of our drivers complained of accidentally hitting the cruise-control buttons on the bottom of the steering wheel hub . Again , we placed the other two in a tie for second . We loved the Chevy 's new-generation controls ( except for the cruise control ) , and the Ford 's controls have always been great ( except for that digital radio ) . But once we were out on the road , the rankings changed considerably . Surely , the Ford had the best drive train . And if you 're willing to work hard enough with the gearshift , the stick Dodge small-block ranked second , ahead of the Chevy 350 . Normally , with a lower-output engine of near-identical cubic capacity . we would have a expected the Chevy to deliver slightly better fuel mileage than the Ford , but according to EPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and 16 on the highway , while the Ford delivers 13 and 17 , respectively . Representative fuel mileages during our test , however , confirmed our original expectations . In off-road terrain , the Ford achieved 4.6 mpg ( partly because it was such fun to drive at full throttle ) , the Chevy got 5.4 mpg , and the Dodge delivered a remarkable 10.3 mpg . In a mix of street and highway driving , we saw 10.3 mpg for the Ford , 12.1 for the Chevy , and a straight 17 mpg for the Dodge . And the Winnah Is .. , ... still being argued . If you want a heavy-duty work truck with plenty of engine that does part-time hunting and fishing , the winner is the Ford . If you 're going to do a lot of mild up-country driving , and saving money on fuel means a lot , you want the Chevy . But if you only occasionally go off-road , need roominess , and really love getting the most out of a small-block V-8 , the Dodge is your only call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town , was n't good enough off-road to justify its four-wheel drive . And despite really superb handling and a great interior , the Chevy simply did n't have enough engine to make us grin . One truck left  --  the powerful , great-handling , great-braking , and all  --  around exemplary Ford F150 Flareside . There just was n't a thing this truck could n't do really well  --  except maybe tune in KRAW-FM 108 , Easy-Listenin ' for Today 's Heavy-Metal Nuclear Family . <p>
