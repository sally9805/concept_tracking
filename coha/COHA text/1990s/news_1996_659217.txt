<p> Lower demand from large newspaper companies which stocked up on newsprint in expectation of an April price increase have prevented paper producers from raising prices after all . <p> Newspapers bought more than enough newsprint for the first three months of the year and now are going to cut back on their orders , said Dick Cason , director of corporate purchasing for the Tribune Co. , which publishes four newspapers , including the Chicago Tribune . <p> " We 've got too much newsprint ; they 're making more than we need , and that 's putting pressure on the price , " he said . <p> Inventory is 40 percent to 50 percent higher than normal nationwide , and the Tribune plans to cut its newsprint order 12 percent to 15 percent for April , Cason said . <p> The producers , including Abitibi-Price Inc. in Toronto , have told customers they will not go through with a planned 7 percent price increase in April . The decision was due in part to the high inventory buildups , Abitibi-Price spokeswoman Susan Rogers said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April , " she said , giving no indication of future pricing moves but noting that the fall presidential election and the Summer Olympics could drive up newspaper circulation later in the year . <p> " As other factors ( emerge ) ... we might look at it again , " she said . <p> Many newspapers had factored the increase into their budgets and the result will be lower-than-expected operating costs . <p> That will not translate into increased hiring , however . <p> " I do n't see any kind of reemployment factors at this time , " said Kenneth T. Berents , director of research at the investment firm Wheat First Butcher &; Singer in Richmond , Va . <p> The industry went through a squeeze last year due in part to high newsprint prices . The rising cost of newsprint was cited as a contributing factor in the folding of The Houston Post , the elimination of hundreds of jobs at the Los Angeles Times and the cancellation of Newsday 's New York City edition . <p> " Last year newsprint prices forced companies to screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not about to ( raise them ) ... by rehiring bodies .

" We had thought price increases ... could be as high as over 30 percent year over year , but it 's much more probable that increases would be in the low 20 ( percent range ) year over year . " <p> At Gannett Co . Inc. , senior vice president Mimi Feller said eliminating the April increase would have little effect because high prices are carrying over into this year . <p> Boston Globe Announces Layoffs in Mail Room ; Execs Lose Week 's Pay <p> BOSTON ( AP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its mail room and curbing overtime and hiring , while giving its top executives the choice between a week 's unpaid vacation or working a week for free . <p> The newspaper said the measures would save $ 4.4 million , helping to make up for record-high newsprint prices and advertising revenue that is below expectations . <p> " The outlook remains tenuous for the next several months , " publisher William O.

" <p> The layoffs are scheduled to take effect in April . <p> The top 14 executives will lose a week 's pay , and all other Globe managers may participate in voluntary one-week leaves without pay , the company said . <p> The company said newsprint costs would reach $ 95 million this year , 14 percent higher than last year and nearly 60 percent more than in 1994 . <p> The decision to make the cuts was made locally , said Richard Gulla , the Globe 's spokesman . <p> The New York Times paid $ 1.1 billion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a newspaper , but agreed to leave all operational decisions to local editors and executives for five years . <p> Times Mirror Looks to Divest College , Scientific Publishing <p> LOS ANGELES ( AP ) - Times Mirror Co.

Willes , Times Mirror 's chairman , said the company wants to concentrate in areas where it can be a clear leader , and it is n't that in college and scientific publishing . It 's the No. 5 college publisher . <p> The Higher Education Group consists of business and economics publisher Richard D.

Appeals courts hear only arguments by lawyers seeking to have a lower court decision overturned or upheld . <p> The Judicial Conference of the United States took no position on pending legislation in Congress that would allow closed-circuit television in the Oklahoma City bombing case , saying the decision should be up to the trial judge . <p> However , the conference urged Congress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bar such financial aid . <p> The bombing trial has been moved to Denver .

Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist presides over the panel . <p> Chief Judge Gilbert Merritt of the federal court of appeals in Nashville said closed-circuit television is appropriate in the Oklahoma City case and does not set a precedent . The judge in the case has said he will not permit the proceedings to be televised . <p> Merritt noted that closed-circuit television has been used in cases where an unruly defendant is moved to another room and permitted to watch the court proceedings on television . <p> The judicial conference conducted a limited three-year test of cameras in federal courtrooms beginning in 1991 . But when it was over , the conference decided against allowing cameras on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras on some witnesses and jurors was cause for serious concern .

It strongly urged circuit court councils to do away with any local court rules that would conflict with the decision to retain the trial court ban . <p> That action stemmed from a decision March 1 by U.S. District Judge Robert Ward in Manhattan that allowed Court TV to televise a hearing in a class-action lawsuit challenging New York City 's child welfare system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said permitted judges to authorize cameras .

All four newspapers have reported numerous developments on those allegations . <p> Collins said some reporters tried to enter her hospital room . <p> " As described by the congresswoman , the press acted like rabid animals in pursuit of their news stories . They terrorized Ms. Collins and her family and were totally disrespectful to the nurses and doctors , " Wright 's letter said . <p> Hospital spokeswoman Lee Sullivan said that when asked how she wanted media questions handled , the congresswoman did n't mention any problems , and the hospital was unaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no record of someone trying to get into the congresswoman 's room , according to Sullivan . <p> " I think the media was pretty cool throughout her hospitalization .

Also , nobody from The Hill went to the hospital , according to Sarah Pekkanen , the newspaper 's main reporter writing about Collins . <p> Chip Visci , managing editor of the Detroit Free Press , said he was certain that his reporters were professional and did not terrorize Collins ' family . <p> " I wish she would respond to questions , but she is not obligated to , " Visci said . <p> The Hill said it had run about 15 articles on Collins ' problems since August and she had not been talking to that paper for months , anyway . <p> Craig Winneker , managing editor of Roll Call , said he has published a few articles about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not talk to the paper . <p> A record 182 journalists were in prison in 22 countries at the end of 1995 , more than a quarter of them in Turkey , the Committee to Protect Journalists said . <p> " Turkey has the dubious honor of imprisoning more journalists than any other country for the second consecutive year , " the report said March 14 . <p> Overall , the committee documented 720 cases of imprisonment , assault and legal harassment of reporters around the globe .
