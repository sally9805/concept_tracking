In imparting his vision of America , Newt Gingrich has a way of dropping names . Say , Hewlett-Packard and Health South Inc. during his series of videotaped college lectures ; Johnson &; Johnson and other pharmaceutical giants in letters to the White House and the Food and Drug Administration . By coincidence or design , many of the name-dropped have deposited timely contributions to organizations linked to Gingrich . Disclosures about the favors and donations provoked growing scrutiny last week of the Progress and Freedom Foundation , a Gingrich think tank that seems to churn as much cash as ideas . Declared Ellen Miller , executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics , It 's just another way in which Newt Gingrich 's coat has many pockets . ' ' <P> Or a way he buttonholes his way to political profit . In the last Congress Gingrich introduced three bills to suspend duties on drug ingredients imported by Solvay Pharmaceuticals , a subsidiary of a large Belgian company based in his Georgia district . In January 1994 Solvay contributed $30,000 to the foundation . In mid-1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drug manufactured by Solvay . Last September Gingrich lobbied the White House and the FDA on behalf of Direct Access Diagnostics , a Johnson &; Johnson subsidiary that was seeking approval for a home test kit to detect the AIDS virus . Soon after , Direct Access contributed an estimated $30,000 to the foundation . <P> News of Gingrich 's efforts on behalf of the two companies added to a growing ethical controversy . The House ethics committee is already looking into donations to GOPAC , the Gingrich-led political-action committee that received money from corporations like Hewlett-Packard . The committee is also probing his lucrative contract to write two books for media mogul Rupert Murdoch . <P> In the case of the drug companies , there is no linkage between the favors Gingrich did for them and the money they gave the foundation , says Jeffrey Eisenach , founder and president of the foundation . Indeed , Gingrich had been railing against the inefficiencies at the FDA long before he asked the foundation to provide him with a plan for revamping the agency and before it even started collecting donations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these donations or that the foundation promised influence when seeking financial support . <P> That does not exempt him from charges of hypocrisy . Newt Gingrich complained about the corrupt system when he was in the minority , ' ' says Fred Wertheimer of Common Cause , who six years ago gave crucial support to Gingrich 's effort to oust Speaker Jim Wright for ethics violations . Now he 's running that corrupt system , and it 's politics as usual . ' ' <P> Eisenach describes himself as Gingrich 's intellectual sidekick , ' ' but he insists the foundation is wholly independent of Gingrich as well as organizations like GOPAC . That defense is less than satisfying to critics . Before founding Progress and Freedom , Eisenach was executive director of GOPAC . His think tank , furthermore , is steward to Renewing American Civilization , ' ' the 20-hour college course that Gingrich teaches . Eisenach , however , denies that he remains beholden to partisan zealots at GOPAC . The clique that feeds at the trough of Republican politics is not my crowd , ' ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd leave them alone if they 'd leave me alone . ' '
