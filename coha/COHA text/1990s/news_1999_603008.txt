<p> ORGAN PIPE CACTUS NATIONAL MONUMENT , Ariz.  --  Rust-red mountains and green saguaro cactuses highlight a gorgeous panorama at this remote national park , a pristine enclave of 330,000 acres in the Sonoran Desert . Quail rustle in the brush , and piglike javelinas munch on roots and leaves . <p> But park ranger Karl Pearson ignores the scenery , peering instead at the dirt and pebbles on the dry ground . Reading clues invisible to an untrained eye , he sees trouble . <p> " This is what I was afraid of , " he says , pointing to some faint , dun-colored circles in the soil : horses ' hoofprints . " You can see tracks right here in the road , real fresh . I 'll bet they came back this morning . " <p> The riders , Pearson believes , were not on an innocent jaunt . More likely , he says , they were drug traffickers returning to Mexico after smuggling hundreds of pounds of marijuana north through the park into the USA . <p> As federal authorities tighten security at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilder , less-guarded sections  --  and that often means national parks . Many park officials say the crackdowns at the border sectors near El Paso and McAllen , Texas ; Nogales , Ariz. ; and San Diego have contributed to a recent rise in the flow of drugs through the parks , though they decline to release statistics . " We shift our efforts , they shift theirs , to the path of least resistance , " says Joel Wright , an El Paso-based special agent for the National Park Service . <p> As a result , authorities in the border parks are seizing thousands of pounds of drugs a year and arresting dozens of people . Drug smugglers have threatened rangers , trampled delicate plants and burned historic structures . <p> Smugglers try to sneak through a half-dozen national parks , including : <p>  --  Biscayne National Park , near Homestead , Fla . Consisting of about 300 square miles of ocean sprinkled with a handful of islands , this park makes a spacious entryway for smugglers bringing drugs by boat from Mexico or the Caribbean . <p> In their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats aground in shallow waters , killing fragile sea grass . In August , suspected drug traffickers being pursued by U.S. agents jumped overboard , leaving their vessel making tight circles at 30 mph in a section of the park covered with shallow reefs . Agents left the boat alone until engine failure slowed it . Four men were arrested . <p> Smugglers usually try to slip through the park 's waters at night , without lights , at the same time that commercial and recreational fishermen are chasing stone crabs and lobsters . " It 's certainly exciting if a 30-foot go-fast ( boat ) zings by you at 30 mph , " says law-enforcement specialist Kim Korthuis , who says he 's had that experience many times . He worries that it could be much worse than exciting someday for a luckless boater . <p>  --  Padre Island National Seashore , near Corpus Christi , Texas . This park stretches along the Gulf Coast for 75 miles , making an inviting landing place for loads of drugs from northeastern Mexico . Smugglers ferry drugs in small , speedy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's beaches , where trucks pick up the shipments . <p> Sometimes a bale of drugs falls off a boat , or traffickers abandon their load when the authorities close in . Cocaine often washes up onshore , as do marijuana bundles , chief ranger Gus Martinez says . <p> On an afternoon in October , alerted that traffickers might be in the area , Martinez began monitoring the main park road . The smugglers did n't notice the patrol car by the side of the highway . " They were in a hurry , they broke a couple of ( traffic ) laws , and I pulled them over , " Martinez says . <p> Sitting in the bed of the smugglers ' pickup were several duffel bags , which proved to be loaded with drugs . " It was right there , " Martinez says with amusement . The five men were arrested . <p> Martinez thinks the park 's drug traffic poses little risk to law-abiding beachgoers . But he resents the time and money spent in chasing down traffickers . Those resources could be better spent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and animals , he says . " We do n't know what we 've got because we 're busy chasing drug dealers , " Martinez complains . <p>  --  North Cascades National Park , near Sedro-Woolley , Wash . In southern British Columbia , physically fit smugglers load canoes or kayaks full of potent Canadian marijuana . Then they paddle down the park 's Ross Lake , which stretches from the U.S.-Canadian border to Washington 's Highway 20 . <p> The only arrest so far came a few years ago after a smuggler failed to meet his contact on Highway 20 , chief ranger Pete Cowan says . The smuggler decided to hitchhike  --  and accepted a ride from a park employee , who wondered why anyone would be kayaking in November . <p> The employee alerted park security . The kayaker , who was carrying a load of marijuana , was arrested and spent several months in jail . <p> Cowan warns that there 's still a potential for danger , no matter how hapless some smugglers are . " There 's big money involved here . There are big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When backed into a corner , those criminals could be a potential threat to unsuspecting tourists . " <p> In fact , rangers say what worries them most is the safety of the park 's legitimate visitors . Officials emphasize that their parks are extremely safe . But one park visitor was assaulted recently near the Mexican border , and rangers fear that there may be more such incidents as cross-border drug traffic rises . <p> " The potential 's there for anything to happen at any time , " says Joel Wright , the park service agent in El Paso . " The potential for violence is there daily . " <p> Rangers are doing what they can . But the anti-drug work done by park rangers is only one small skirmish in a much larger war , and many park officials say there is never enough money and not enough staff to stanch the flow of drugs . <p> " I do n't want to be pessimistic , " says Dan Wirth , a Tucson-based special agent for the park service . " But with the current staffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequately stem the tide of drug trafficking through public lands . We 're just too overwhelmed . " <p> Rangers have always dealt with a darker side of park use . Criminals have prowled the national parks since before they were national parks . The tequila-like liquor mescal , for example , has been smuggled from Mexico through land that 's now U.S. parks for decades . <p> These days some smugglers are better organized , have much more money and can afford better technology than they could in the past , officials say . Traffickers use encrypted communications and conduct their own surveillance of law enforcement agencies and park rangers . They might carry cell phones , night-vision goggles and automatic weapons . <p> Smugglers also rely on a combination of camouflage and chutzpah . <p> At seaside parks , they 've been found carrying fishing poles and camping gear while waiting on the beach for a shipment . In Big Bend National Park in southern Texas , rangers once trailed a suspicious motor home , chief ranger Bill Wright says . The occupants coolly stayed in character . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country , " Wright recalls . " They had a camera and a cooler "  --  and 70 pounds of marijuana hidden in a tire . <p> At some parks , smuggling is so prevalent that unsuspecting visitors have seen traffickers at work . Rangers would rather keep them unaware . " We do n't tell them , ' Oh , you probably saw a load being delivered , ' " Bill Wright says dryly . " It does n't add to the visitor experience . " <p> Sometimes the contact is more direct . In July , a visitor strolling the beach at Gulf Islands National Seashore  --  a collection of islands and mainland parcels in Mississippi and Florida  --  found a bundle marked with gold seals bearing the words " Republic of Colombia . " The man reported his find to a ranger : two bricks of cocaine with a combined street value of $ 50,000 . <p> In 1997 at the Coronado National Memorial on the Mexican border near Hereford , Ariz. , suspected drug smugglers pushed a female visitor down a hill , then stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman was not seriously hurt and her vehicle was recovered , but no one was caught . <p> At Organ Pipe , near the town of Why , Ariz. , visitors occasionally stumble across drug caches . Several years ago , an off-trail hiker found a duffel bag in the desert holding 11 pounds of marijuana . <p> While such incidents are rare , the evidence of drug trafficking is plentiful at the park . Steering a patrol truck , ranger Pearson drives north along State Highway 85 , which runs from the Mexican border almost to Phoenix . He stops at what looks like any other wide spot in the road and walks a few hundred feet off the blacktop , which is already sizzling in the heat of a desert morning . <p> At the base of some dark volcanic rocks overlooking the road , Pearson finds a heap of old gunny sacks and ropes . They 're the remains of homemade backpacks for smuggling drugs . <p> " This was probably a load of 300 to 400 pounds , " he says , examining the trash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " <p> A shipment of that size has a street value of roughly $ 300,000 , he says . It probably was carried 8 to 10 miles across the desert by young Mexican men known as " mules . " <p> " The mules are just kids , tough kids , and they pack it across on their backs , " Pearson says . " You 've seen sugar bags of nylon mesh . They 'll pack it in that , 50 pounds ( apiece ) . These guys are tough , they 're strong . " Many are in their teens and 20s , Pearson says , and " are not getting paid much to do this . From what I hear , they 're getting $ 200 , $ 300 . " <p> Some of the mules die in the attempt ; others end up in American prisons . <p> Twenty feet from the pile of rubbish Pearson has been inspecting is a trail worn by the feet of smugglers and illegal immigrants . The trail is littered with one-gallon plastic water jugs . The smugglers usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jugs black for camouflage . Crews pick up thousands of jugs each year , Pearson says . <p> Park officials are also dismayed by the damage done by couriers . In the fragile desert , a trail used only once can take 30 years to fade ; trails used frequently can be all but permanent . <p> When smugglers tear across the desert in cars to avoid agents , " they may mow down a 2-foot saguaro that 's 50 years old , " ranger Susan Hughes says . " They do n't care what they 're driving over . " <p> Smugglers passing through Organ Pipe try to avoid detection . But if they 've been seen , they sometimes take desperate , though not necessarily violent , measures , Pearson says . <p> Park service trucks have been rammed by smugglers ' vehicles . And smugglers carrying drugs in their trunks , when spotted by authorities , sometimes roar back to Mexico at 90 mph-plus on Highway 85 , which carries thousands of people a day .
