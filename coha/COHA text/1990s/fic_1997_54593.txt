Rules were made to be broken , so the adage goes . But what about vows ? A vow should never be broken  --  but observe how far they 'll sometimes bend ... <p> The snow was falling harder now . Kassianos ' mule , a good stubborn beast , kept slogging forward until it came to a drift that reached its belly . Then it stopped , looking reproachfully back over its shoulder at the priest . <p> " Oh , very well , " he said , as if it could understand . " This must be as Phos wills . That town the herder spoke of ca n't be far ahead . We 'll lay over in  --  what did he call it ?  --  Develtos till the weather gets better . Are you satisfied , beast ? " <p> The mule snorted and pressed ahead . Maybe it did understand , Kassianos thought . He had done enough talking at it , this past month on the road . He loved to talk , and had not had many people to talk to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he was mad to set out for Opsikion so late in the year . He had n't listened ; that was n't nearly so much fun as talking . <p> " Unfortunately , they were right , " he said . This time , the mule paid him no attention . It had reached the same conclusion a long time ago . <p> The wind howled out of the north . Kassianos drew his blue robe more tightly about himself , not that that did much good . Because the road from the capital of the Empire to Opsikion ran south of the Paristrian mountains , he had assumed they would shield him from the worst of the weather . Maybe they did . If so , though , the provinces on the other side of the mountains had winters straight from the ice of Skotos ' hell . <p> Where was he ? For that matter , where was the road ? When it ran between leaf-bare trees , it had been easy enough to follow . Now , in more open country , the pesky thing had disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nuisance ( in better weather , Kassianos reminded himself , it would n't have happened ) . In this blizzard , it was becoming serious . If he went by Develtos , he might freeze before he could find shelter . <p> He tugged on the reins . The mule positively scowled at him : what was he doing , halting in the cold middle of nowhere ? " I need to find the town , " he explained . The mule did not look convinced . <p> He paused a moment in thought . He had never been to Develtos , had nothing from it with him . That made worthless most of the simpler spells of finding he knew . He thought of one that might serve , then promptly rejected it : it involved keeping a candle lit for half an hour straight . " Not bloody likely , I 'm afraid , " he said . <p> He thought some more , then laughed out loud . " As inelegant an application of the law of similarity as ever there was , " he declared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . " <p> He dismounted , tied the mule 's reins to a bush so it would not wander off while he was incanting . Then , after suitable prayers and passes , he undid his robe and pissed  --  quickly , because it was very cold . <p> His urine did not just form a puddle between his feet . Instead , impelled by his magic , it drew a steaming line in the snow toward more like itself , and thus , indirectly , toward the people who made it . <p> " That way , eh ? " Kassianos said , eyeing the direction of the line . " I might have known the wind would make me drift south of where I should be . " He climbed back onto his mule , urged it forward . It went eagerly , as if it sensed he knew where he was going again . <p> Sure enough , not a quarter of an hour later the priest saw the walls of Develtos looming tall and dark through the driving snow . He had to ride around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate . It was closed and barred . He shouted . Nothing happened . He shouted again , louder . <p> After a couple of minutes , a peephole opened . " Who ye be ? " the man inside called , his accent rustic . " Show yerself to me and give me your name . " <p> " I am Kassianos , eastbound from Videssos the city , " the priest answered . He rode a couple of steps closer , lowered his hood so the guard could see not only his blue robe but also his shaven head . " May I have shelter before I am too far gone to need it ? " <p> He did not hear anyone moving to unlatch the gate . Instead , the sentry asked sharply , " Just the one of you there ? " <p> " Only myself . In Phos ' holy name I swear it . " Kassianos understood the gate-guard 's caution . Winter could easily make a bandit band desperate enough to try to take a walled town , and falling snow give them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate was open , and who could say what horrors would follow ? <p> But Kassianos must have convinced the guardsman . " We 'll have you inside in a minute , holy sir . " The fellow 's voice grew muffled as he turned his face away from the peephole . " Come on , Phostis , Evagrios , give me a hand with this bloody bar . " Kassianos heard it scrape against the iron-faced timbers of the gate . <p> One of the valves swung inward . The priest dug his heels into the mule 's flanks . It trotted into Develtos . The sentries closed the gate after it , shoved the bar back into place . " Thank you , gentlemen , " Kassianos said sincerely . <p> " Aye , you 're about this far from being a snowman , are n't you , holy sir ? " said the guard who had been at the peephole . Now Kassianos could see more of him than a suspicious eyeball : he was short and lean , with a knitted wool cap on his head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His bow was a hunter 's weapon , not a soldier 's . He was , in other words , a typical small-town guardsman . <p> " Want I should take you to Branas ' tavern , holy sir , let you warm yourself up outside and in ? " asked one of the other guards . But for a back-and-breast of boiled leather and a light spear in place of a bow , he was as like the first as two peas in a pod . He glanced toward that man , who was evidently his superior . " Is it all right , Tzitas ? " <p> " Aye , go on , Phostis , we 'll manage here . " Tzitas showed his teeth in a knowing grin . " Just do n't spend too much time warming yourself up in there . " <p> " Would n't think of it , " Phostis said righteously . <p> " No , you would n't ; you 'd do it , " said Evagrios , who 'd been quiet till then . Tzitas snorted . <p> Phostis sent them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest . " You come with me , holy sir . Pay these scoffers no mind . " He started off down the street . His boots left pockmarks in the snow . Still on muleback , Kassianos followed . <p> The tavern was less than a hundred yards away . ( Nothing in Develtos , come to that , looked to be more than a quarter mile from anything else . The town barely rated a wall . ) In that short journey , though , Phostis asked Kassianos about Videssos the city four different times , and told him twice of some distant cousin who had gone there to seek his fortune . " He must have found it , too , " Phostis said wistfully , " for he never came back no more . " <p> He might have starved trying , Kassianos thought , but the priest was too kind to say that out loud . Videssos ' capital drew the restless and ambitious from all over the Empire , and in such fast company not all could flourish . <p> Even with Phostis ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have guessed which building was Branas ' from the number of horses and donkeys tied up in front of it . He found space at the rail for his mule , then went in after the sentry . <p> He shut the door behind him so none of the blessed heat inside would escape . A few quick steps brought him to the fireplace . He sighed in pure animal pleasure as the warmth began driving the ice from his bones . When he put a hand to his face , he discovered he could feel the tip of his nose again . He 'd almost forgotten he still owned it . <p> After roasting a bit longer in front of the flames , Kassianos felt restored enough to find a stool at a table close by . A barmaid came over , looked him up and down . " What 'll it be ? " she asked , matter-of-fact as if he were carpenter rather than priest . <p> " Hot red wine , spiced with cinnamon . " <p> She nodded , saucily ran her hand over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right enough . " Her hips worked as she walked back to the tapman with his order ; she looked over her shoulder at the priest , as if to make sure he was watching her . <p> His blood heated with a warmth that had nothing to do with the blaze crackling in the fireplace . He willed himself to take no notice of that new heat . Celibacy went with Phos ' blue robe . He frowned a little . Even the most shameless tavern wenches knew that . Clerics were men too , and might forget their vows , but he still found an overture as blatant as this girl 's startling . Even in the jaded capital , a lady of easy virtue would have been more discreet . The same should have gone double for this back-country town . <p> The barmaid returned with his steaming mug . As he fumbled in his beltpouch for coppers to pay the score , she told him , " You want to warm up the parts fire and wine do n't reach , you let me know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a table halfway across the room . She hurried off , but again smiled back at Kassianos as she went . <p> Before he lifted the cup to his lips , he raised his hands to heaven and intoned the usual Videssian prayer before food or drink : " We bless thee , Phos , lord with the great and good mind , by thy grace our protector , watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor . " Then he spat in the rushes to show his rejection of Skotos . At last he drank . The cinnamon nipped his tongue like a playful lover . The figure of speech would not have occurred to him a moment before . Now it seemed only too appropriate . <p> When his mug was empty , he raised a finger . The girl hurried over . " Another , please , " he said , setting more coppers on the table . <p> She scooped them up . " For some silver  --  " She paused expectantly . <p> " My vows do not allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them lightly ? " he asked . He kept his voice mild , but his eyes seized and held hers . He had overawed unrepentant clerics in the ecclesiastical courts of the capital ; focusing his forensic talents on a chit of a barmaid reminded him of smashing some small crawling insect with an anvil . But she had roused his curiosity , if not his manhood . <p> " The monks hereabouts like me plenty well , " she sniffed ; she sounded offended he did not find her attractive . " And since you 're a man from Videssos the city itself " ( news traveled fast , Kassianos thought , unsurprised ) , " I reckoned you 'd surely be freer yet . " <p> Along with its famed riches , the capital also had a reputation in the provinces as a den of iniquity . Sometimes , Kassianos knew , it was deserved . But not in this ... " You are mistaken , " the priest replied . " The monks like you well , you say ? " <p> The girl 's eyes showed she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not the only one , " she said hastily . " There 's a good many women they favor here in town , most of ' em a lot more than me . " <p> She contradicted herself , Kassianos noted , but never mind that now . " Are there indeed ? " he said , letting some iron come into his voice . " Perhaps you will be so good as to give me their names ? " <p> " No . Why should I ? " She had spirit ; she could still defy him . <p> He dropped the anvil . " Because I am Kassianos , nomophylax  --  chief counsel , you might say  --  to the most holy ecumenical Patriarch Tarasios , prelate of Videssos the city and Videssos the Empire . I was summoned to Opsikion to deal with a troublesome case of false doctrine there , but I begin to think the good god Phos directed me here instead . Now speak to me further of these monks . " <p> The barmaid fled instead . Eyes followed her from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The big man whose place was behind the bar slowly ambled over to his table . As if by chance , he held a stout club in his right fist . " Do n't know what you said to little Laskara , blue-robe , " he said casually , " but she did n't much like it . " <p> " And I , friend , did not much like her seeking to lead me astray from my vows , and liked even less her telling me the monks hereabouts are accustomed to ignoring theirs , " Kassianos answered . " I do not think the most holy Tarasios , Phos bless him , would like that either . Perhaps if I root out the evil , it will never have to come to his attention . " <p> At the mention of that name , the tapman sat down heavily beside Kassianos , as if his legs no longer wanted to support him . The priest heard him drop the bludgeon among the dried rushes on the floor . " The  --  Patriarch ? " the fellow said hoarsely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinkled . Most of the time , being nomophylax was nothing but drudgery . Sometimes , as now , it was fun . " Suppose you tell me about the lecherous monks you have here . Your Laskara thought I was of the same stripe as they , and tried to sell herself to me . " <p> " Aye , we have a monastery here , dedicated to the holy Tralitzes , Phos bless his memory . " The tapman drew the good god 's sun-circle over his heart . Kassianos had never heard of the local saint , but that hardly signified : every little town had some patron to commemorate . The tapman went on , " But the monks , lecherous ? No , holy sir  --  they 're good men , pious men , every one . " <p> He sounded sincere , and too shaken to be lying so well . " Do they then conform to the rules set down by the holy Pakhomios , in whose memory all monks serve ? " Kassianos asked . <p> " Holy sir , I 'm no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I du n no what all these rules and things is . " The fellow was sweating , and not from the fireplace 's being near . <p> " Very well , then , hear the seventh chapter of Pakhomios ' Rule , the chapter entitled ' On Women ' : ' To ensure the preservation of the contemplative life , no brother shall be permitted to entertain women . ' " <p> " I du n no about any of that , " the tapman insisted . With a sudden access of boldness , he went on , " And it 's not me you should ought to be going after if you 've got somewhat against our monks . You take that up with the abbot  --  Menas , is name is . " <p> " I shall , " Kassianos promised . " Believe me , I shall . " <p> The Holy Tralitzes ' monastery lay a couple of miles outside Develtos . Monks working in the snowy fields and gardens looked up from their labors as Kassianos rode toward Phos ' temple , the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the others by a spire topped with a gilded globe . <p> An elderly monk came out of the temple , bowed courteously to Kassianos . " Phos with you , holy sir , " he said . " I am Pleuses , porter of the monastery . How may I serve you ? " <p> Kassianos dismounted , returned the bow . " And with you , brother Pleuses . I have come to see your abbot  --  Menas is his name , is it not ? I am Kassianos , nomophylax to Tarasios . Would you announce me to the holy abbot ? " <p> Pleuses ' eyes widened . He bowed once more . " Certainly , holy sir . Menas will surely be honored to entertain such a distinguished guest . " He shouted for a younger brother to take charge of Kassianos ' mule , then , bowing a third time , said , " Will you come with me ? " <p> The abbot 's residence lay beyond the dormitory that housed the rest of the monks . " Wait here a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went in and , as promised , quickly returned . " He will see you now . " <p> Kassianos was expecting a leering voluptuary . The sight of Menas came as something of a shock . He was a thin , pleasant-faced man of about forty-five , with laugh lines crinkling the comers of his eyes . Among the codices and scrolls on bookshelves behind him were many , both religious and secular , that Kassianos also esteemed . <p> The abbot rose , bowed , hurried up to clasp Kassianos ' hand . " Phos bless you , holy sir , and welcome , welcome . Will you take wine ? " <p> " Thank you , father abbot . " <p> Menas poured with his own hands . While he was doing so , he asked , " May I be permitted to wonder why such an illustrious cleric has chosen to honor our humble monastery with his presence ? " <p> Kassianos ' eyes flicked to Pleuses . Menas followed his glance , and dismissed the porter with a few murmured words . The abbot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not chosen to be fools . The two men performed the usual Videssian ritual over wine , then Menas returned to his own seat and waved Kassianos to the other , more comfortable , chair in the room . The abbot 's question still hung in the air . <p> " Father abbot , " Kassianos began , more carefully than he had intended before meeting Menas , " I came to Develtos by chance a few days ago , compelled by the blizzard to take shelter here . In Branas ' tavern , a chance remark led me to believe the monks practiced illegal , immoral cohabitation with women , contrary to the strictures of the seventh chapter of the holy Pakhomios ' Rule . " <p> " That is not so , " Menas said quietly . " We follow the Rule in all its particulars . " <p> " I am glad to hear you say that . " Kassianos nodded . " But I must tell you that my inquiries since I came here made me think otherwise . And , father abbot , they make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Having once said that I adhere to Pakhomios ' Rule , I do not suppose that mere repetition will persuade you I speak truly , " Menas said after a moment 's thought . He grinned wryly ; shaven head and gray-streaked beard or no , it made him look very young . " And , having now once said something you do not believe , I can not hope you will accept my oath . " He spread his hands . " You see my difficulty . " <p> " I do . " Kassianos nodded again . He thought better of Menas for not gabbling oaths that , as the abbot pointed out , had to be thought untrustworthy . He had not expected or wanted to think better of Menas . He had wanted to get on with the business of reforming the monastery . Things did not seem as simple as he 'd thought . Well , as nomophylax he 'd had that happen to him often enough . <p> " I will follow any suggestion you may have on resolving this difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Very well , then : I know a decoction under whose influence you will speak truth . Are you willing to drink it down and then answer my questions ? " <p> " So long as you are asking about these alleged misdeeds , certainly . " <p> Menas showed no hesitation . If he was an actor , he was a good one , Kassianos thought . But no one could dissemble under the influence of this potion , no matter how he schooled himself beforehand . <p> " I shall compound the drug this evening and return to administer it tomorrow morning , " the nomophylax said . Menas nodded agreement . Kassianos wondered how brash he would be once his lascivious secrets were laid bare . <p> The abbot peered curiously at the small glass flask . He held it to his nose , sniffed . " Not a prize vintage , " he observed with a chuckle . He tossed the drug down , screwed up his face at the taste . <p> Kassianos admired his effrontery , if nothing else . He waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go from its usual amused alertness to a fixed , vacant stare . The nomophylax rose , passed a hand in front of Menas ' face . Menas ' eyes did not follow the motion . Kassianos nodded to himself . Sure enough , the decoction had taken hold . <p> " Can you hear me ? " he asked . <p> " Aye . " Menas ' voice was distant , abstracted . <p> " Tell me , then , of all the violation , of the holy Pakhomios ' Rule that have occurred among the monks of this monastery over the past half a year . " <p> Menas immediately began to obey : the drug robbed him of his own will and left him perfectly receptive to Kassianos ' question . The nomophylax settled back in his chair and listened as Menas spoke of this monk 's quarrel with that one , of the time when three brothers got drunk together , of the monk who missed evening prayers four days running , of the one who had refused to pull weeds until he was disciplined , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Develtos , of the monk who had stolen a book but tried to put the blame on another , and on and on , all the petty squabbles to which monasteries , being made up of men , were prone . <p> Kassianos kept pen poised over parchment , ready to note down every transgression of chapter seven of the Rule . Menas talked and talked and talked . The pen stayed poised . Kassianos wrote nothing , for the abbot gave him nothing to write . <p> Menas , at length , ran dry . Kassianos scowled , ran a hand over his smooth pate . " Do you recall nothing more ? " he demanded harshly . <p> " Nothing , holy sir . " Menas ' voice was calm ; it would not have changed had Kassianos held his hand to the flame flickering in the lamp on the table beside him . The nomophylax knew he was deeply under the influence of the potion . He also knew the monks of the monastery of the holy Tralitzes had illicit congress with a great many women of Develtos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain of that as he was of Phos ' eventual victory over Skotos . <p> Kassianos hesitated before asking his next question . But , having failed with a general inquiry , he saw no choice but to probe specifically at the rot he knew existed : " Tell me of every occasion when the monks of this monastery have transgressed against the seventh chapter of the holy Pakhomios ' Rule , the chapter which forbids the brethren to entertain women . " <p> Menas was silent . Kassianos wondered if the abbot could somehow be struggling against the decoction . He shook his head  --  he knew perfectly well it was irresistible . " Why do you not speak ? " the nomophylax snapped . <p> " Because I know of no occasion when the monks of this monastery have transgressed against the seventh chapter of the holy Pakhomios ' Rule , the chapter which forbids the brethren to entertain women . " <p> The rotelike repetition of his words and the tone of the abbot 's voice convinced Kassianos that Menas was still drugged . So did the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this potion had nothing to say in response to a question , he would keep right on saying nothing until jogged by a new one . Which , depressingly , was just what Menas had done . <p> Kassianos sighed . He neither liked nor approved of paradoxes . Knowing that because of the decoction he was only being redundant , he nevertheless asked , " Do you swear by Phos you have told me the truth ? " <p> " I swear by Phos I have told you the truth , " Menas replied . <p> The nomophylax ground his teeth . If Menas swore under the drug that the monks of the monastery of the holy Tralitzes were obeying Pakhomios ' Rule , then they were , and that was all there was to it . So act as though you believe it , Kassianos told himself . He could not . <p> He was tempted to walk out of Menas ' study and let the abbot try to deal with the monastery 's affairs while still in the grip of the potion . He had played that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collegium . Regretfully , he decided it was beneath the dignity of the Patriarch 's nomophylax . He sat and waited until he was sure Menas had come around . <p> " Remarkable , " the abbot said when he was himself again . " I felt quite beside myself . Had we been guilty of any transgressions of the sort you were seeking , I would not have been able to keep them from you . " <p> " That , father abbot , was the idea , " Kassianos said tightly . He knew he should have been more courteous , but could not manage it , not with the feeling something was wrong still gnawing at him . But , not having anything on which to focus his suspicions , he could only rise abruptly and go out into the cold for the ride to Develtos . <p> He kept asking questions when he got back into town . The answers he got set him stewing all over again . They were not given under the influence of his decoction , but they were detailed and consistent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monks of the monastery of the holy Tralitzes as the lechers he had already been led to believe them . <p> How , then , had Menas truthfully asserted that he and his flock followed Pakhomios ' Rule ? <p> The question nagged at Kassianos like the beginnings of a toothache for the rest of the day . By this time the snowstorm had long since blown itself out ; he could have gone on to Opsikion . It never occurred to him . After taking his evening meal in Branas ' taproom , he went up to the cubicle he had rented over it . <p> There he sat and thought and fumed . Maybe Menas had found an antidote to his potion . But if he had , it was one that had eluded all the savants at the Sorcerers ' Collegium for all the centuries of Videssos ' history . That was possible , but not likely . Was it likelier than a deliberate campaign of slander against the abbot 's monks ? The nomophylax could not be sure , but he thought both ideas most improbable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pounded a fist against his knee . " What can Menas be up to , anyway ? " he said out loud . Then he blinked , surprised at himself . " Why do n't I find out ? " <p> Normally , he would have dismissed the thought with the same automatic discipline he used to suppress the longing of his flesh for women . Spying sorcerously on a man who had proven himself innocent under drugged interrogation went against every instinct Kassianos had . On the other hand , so did believing Menas . <p> If the abbot is blameless , Kassianos told himself , I 'll perform an act of penance to make up for the sin I commit in spying on him like this . Having salved his conscience , the nomophylax set about preparing the spell he would need . <p> The law of similarity was useless to him here , but the law of contagion applied : once in contact , always in contact . Kassianos scraped a bit of skin from the palm of his right hand with a small sharp knife  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held an affinity for the abbot . <p> As Kassianos ' incantation built , a cloud of smoke grew in his cubicle . It was no ordinary cloud , though , for it formed a rectangle with edges so precise they might have been defined by an invisible picture frame . The analogy pleased Kassianos , for when he spoke a final word of command , the smoke would indeed yield a picture of what Menas was about . <p> He spoke the word . The trapped smoke before him rolled , grew still . Color began seeping into it , here and there . The first thing the nomophylax clearly made out was the roaring fire in one corner of his magical image . He frowned ; the blaze was bigger than any the hearth in the abbot 's dwelling could contain . <p> Of itself , of course , that meant nothing . Menas could have any number of legitimate reasons for not being in his own quarters . Kassianos waited for more of the picture to emerge . <p> Blue ... Surely that was the abbot 's robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . Where was Menas , and why had he thrown aside his vestments ? <p> Within moments , Kassianos had his answer . He felt a hot flush rise , not just to his cheeks , but to the very crown of his shaven head . He turned away from the image he had conjured up , yet still he saw body conjoined with body , saw that the man straining atop his eager partner was the abbot Menas . <p> Kassianos spoke another word , felt his sorcery dissolve . His face remained hot , now with fury rather than embarrassment . So Menas thought he could play him for a fool , eh ? He imagined the abbot telling his paramour how he had fooled the fellow from the capital , and both of them laughing as they coupled . That thought only made the nomophylax 's rage bum hotter . <p> Then he caught himself wishing he had not turned his back quite so soon . He had not thought he could be any angrier , but found he was wrong . Before , his anger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover . Now it reached out and burned him too . <p> Kassianos stamped grimly through the snow toward the monastery of the holy Tralitzes . He had left his mule behind on purpose , accepting the walk as the beginning of the penance he would pay for failing to root out the corruption in the monastery at the first try . His footprints left an emphatic trail behind him . <p> The pale , fitful sun gleamed off the gilded dome topping Phos ' temple ahead . Kassianos turned aside before he was halfway there . Scanning the landscape ahead with a hunter 's alertness , he spotted a blue-robe strolling toward a small wooden house several hundred yards to one side of the monastery . He was not sure whether hunter 's instinct or sorcerer 's told him it was Menas , but he knew . <p> The nomophylax 's breath burst from him in an outraged steaming cloud . " Phos grant us mercy ! Not content with making a mockery of his vows , the sinner goes to show off his stamina , " Kassianos exclaimed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The abbot disappeared into the little house . Some men might have hesitated before disturbing the occupants of a trysting-place , but not Kassianos . He strode resolutely up to pound on the door , crying , " Menas , you are a disgrace to the robes you wear ! Open at once ! " <p> " Oh , dear , " Menas said as Kassianos withered him with a glare . " You do take this seriously , do n't you ? " Now the abbot did not look amused , as he had so often back in his study . He looked frightened . So did the woman around whose shoulder he flung a protective arm . <p> The night before , her features slack with pleasure , she had seemed only a symbol of Menas ' depravity . Now Kassianos had to confront her as a person . She was , he realized slowly , not a whore after all . Perhaps ten years younger than the abbot , she had an open , pretty face , and wore an embroidered linen blouse over a heavy wool skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinging silks . <p> Even without what his magic had let him witness , the way her hand reached up and clutched for Menas ' would have told Kassianos everything he needed to know . It told him other things as well , things he had not thought to learn . It had never occurred to him that the cleric 's illicit lover might feel all the same things for her man as another woman would for a proper partner . <p> Because the woman confused him , Kassianos swung his attention back to Menas . " Should I not take your perjury seriously ? " he said heavily . " It only adds to the burden of your other sins . " <p> " Perjury ? I gave you my oath on Phos , holy sir , under the influence of your own drug , that I truly obey my vows . I do ; I am not forsworn . " <p> Kassianos ' eyes narrowed . " No ? You dare say that , in the company you keep ? Hear once again , then , wretch , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , it is entitled ' On Women . ' I hope you will trust my memory as I quote it : ' To ensure the preservation of the contemplative life , no brother shall be permitted to entertain women . ' Standing where you are , with the person whose house this must be , how can you tell me you are no oathbreaker ? " <p> To the amazement of the nomophylax , Menas ' " companion " burst into laughter . Kassianos stared , thunderstruck . The woman said , " As you guessed , holy sir , this house was my husband 's till he died six years ago , and belongs to me now . And so my dear Menas can not entertain me here . I entertain him , or at least I hope I shall . " She smiled smokily up at the worried abbot , stroked his bearded cheek . <p> Kassianos felt his jaw drop . He became aware that he had not blinked for some time , either . In fact , he realized his expression had to resemble nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with a distinct effort of will , he said slowly , " That is the most outlandish piece of casuistry I 've heard in a lifetime of theological study . " <p> He waited for his pompous wrath to burst forth in a great , furious shout . What came out instead was laughter . And once free , it would not let itself be restrained . Kassianos laughed until tears ran down his face into his beard , laughed until he doubled over . Now Menas and the woman ' were staring at him rather than the other way around . <p> Slowly the fit passed . Kassianos straightened , felt the sudden pain of a stitch in his side , ignored it . He wiped his eyes with his sleeve , then , more or less in control of himself , asked Menas , " Your monks are all , hmm , entertained themselves , and do no entertaining ? " <p> " Of course , holy sir . " The abbot sounded genuinely shocked . " Did we act otherwise , we would violate our vows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How long has this , ah , custom existed at the monastery of the holy Tralitzes ? " <p> " Truly , holy sir , I do not know . Since before I entered as a novice , certainly , and before the novitiate of the oldest brothers there at that time , for they knew no different way . " <p> " I see . " And , curiously enough , Kassianos did . Develtos was just the sort of back-country town where a spurious practice like this could quietly come into being and then flourish for Phos only knew how long before anyone from the outside world noticed it was there . <p> Menas must have been thinking along with him , for he asked , " Holy sir , is it not the same everywhere ? " <p> " Hardly . " Kassianos ' voice was dry . " In fact , I daresay you 've found a loophole to appall the holy Pakhomios  --  and one untold generations of monks have prayed for in vain . I suppose I should congratulate you . Oh , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps you should , but I doubt you will , " Menas ' ladylove observed . " What will you do ? " <p> The nomophylax eyed her with respect : no fool here . " Well , an inquisitor 's court might fight its way through your logic , " he said . Both the woman and Menas looked alarmed . Kassianos went on , " I doubt that will happen , though . " <p> " What then ? " Menas asked . <p> " First , I 'd guess , a synod will convene in Videssos the city to revise the holy Pakhomios ' Rule so no further , ah , misunderstandings of the seventh chapter will occur . That being accomplished , word of the corrected Rule will be sent to all monasteries in the Empire  --  including , I am comfortably certain , this one . " <p> " And what will they do to us for having contravened their interpretation of the Rule ? " Menas asked ; Kassianos noted the slight emphasis the abbot put on " interpretation . " He smiled to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear as virtuous as possible , too . <p> He answered , " While I can not speak for the synod , I would expect it to decree no punishments for what is here a long-established , even if erroneous , custom . I would also expect , however , that an epoptes  --  a supervising monk  --  will come out from the capital to make certain the monastery of the holy Tralitzes diligently adheres to the seventh chapter as redefined . " <p> Neither Menas nor his companion looked very happy at that . The nomophylax had not thought they would . He went on , " I mean what I say . If you continue to flout the Rule after it is changed to mean in letter what it does in spirit , you will not enjoy the consequences . " <p> He had intended to impress them further with the seriousness of the situation . But the woman said , " Then we will just have to make the most of the time we have left . " She shut the door in Kassianos ' face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his own discomfiture , he found himself admiring her . He realized with sudden regret that he had never learned her name . He raised his hand to knock on that closed door and ask . After a moment , he thought better of it . <p> Shaking his head , he turned and slowly started walking back to Develtos . <p> <p> <p> By Harry Turtledove <p>
