1 Laughing , Mary Minor Haristeen studied the nickel in her upturned palm . Over the likeness of Monticello was inscribed our nation 's motto , E Pluribus Unum . She handed the nickel to her older friend , Mrs. Miranda Hogendobber . " What do you think ? " " That nickel is n't worth a red cent . " Mrs. Hogendobber pursed her melon-tinted lips . " And the nickel makes Monticello appear so big and impersonal when it 's quite the reverse , if you 'll forgive the pun . " The two women , one in her mid-thirties and the other at an age she refused to disclose , glanced up from the coin to Monticello 's west portico , its windows aglow with candlelight from the parlor behind as the last rays of the early spring sun dipped behind the Blue Ridge Mountains . If the friends had strolled to the front door of Thomas Jefferson 's house , centered in the east portico , and then walked to the edge of the lawn , they would have viewed a sea of green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic Ocean . Like most born residents of central Virginia 's Albemarle County , Harry Haristeen , as she was known , and Miranda Hogendobber could provide a fascinating tour of Monticello . Miranda would admit to being familiar with the estate since before World War II , but that was all she would admit . Over the decades increasing restoration work on the house itself , the dependencies , and gardens , both food and flowering , had progressed to the point where Monticello was the pride of the entire United States . Over a million out-of-town visitors a year drove up the tricky mountain road to pay their eight dollars , board a jitney bus , and swirl around an even twistier road to the top of thehill and thence the redbrick structure -- each brick fashioned by hand , each hinge pounded out in a smithy , each pane of glass painstakingly blown by a glassmaker , sweating and puffing . Everything about the house suggested individual contribution , imagination , simplicity . As the tulips braved the quickening western winds , Harry and Mrs. Hogendobber , shivering , walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace . A graceful silver maple anchored the corner where they turned . When they reached the front they paused by the large doors . " I 'm not sure I can stand this . " Harry took a deep breath . " Oh , we have to give the devil his due , or should I say her due ? " Mrs. Hogendobber smirked . " She 's been preparing for this for six decades . She 'll say four , but I 've known Mim Sanburne since the earth was cooling . " " Is n't this supposed to be the advantage of living in a small town ? We know everyone and everyone knows us ? " Harry rubbed her tight shoulder muscles . The temperature had dropped dramatically . " Well , okay , let 's brave Mim , the Jefferson expert . " They opened the door , slipping in just as the huge clock perched over the entrance notched up seven p.m . The day , noted by a weight to the right as one faced the door , read Wednesday . The Great Clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design of his home . Even great minds err , however . Jefferson miscalculated the weight and pulley system and ran out of room to register all the days of the week in the hall . Each Friday the day weight slipped through a hole in the floor to the basement , where it marked Friday afternoon and Saturday . The weight then reappeared in the hall on Sunday morning , when the clock was wound . Harry and Mrs. Hogendobber had arrived for a small gathering of Albemarle 's " best , " which is to say those whose families had been in Virginia since before the Revolution , those who were glamorous and recently arrived from Hollywood , which Harry dubbed Hollyweird , and those who were rich . Harry fell into the first category , as did Mrs. Hogendobber . As the postmaster -- Harry preferred the term postmistress -- of the small town of Crozet , Mary Minor Haristeen would never be mistaken for rich . Marilyn Sanburne , known as Mim or Big Marilyn , clasped and unclasped her perfectly manicured hands . The wife of Crozet 's mayor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cool as a cucumber . But a slight case of nerves rattled her as she cast her eyes over the august audience , which included the director of Monticello , the exuberant and fun-loving Oliver Zeve . The head of archaeology , Kimball Haynes , at thirty quite young for such a post , stood at the back of the room . " Ladies and gentlemen "  - -  Mim cleared her throat while her daughter , Little Marilyn , thirty-two , viewed her mother with a skillful show of rapt attention --  " thank you all for taking time out from your busy schedules to gather with us tonight on this important occasion for our beloved Monticello . " " So far so good , " Mrs. Hogendobber whispered to Harry . " With the help of each one of you , we have raised five hundred thousand dollars for the purpose of excavating and ultimately restoring the servants ' quarters on Mulberry Row . " As Mim extolled the value of the new project , Harry reflected on the continued duplicity that existed in her part of the world . Servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt some of them were cherished , beloved even , but the term lent a nice gloss to an ugly reality -- Mr . Jefferson 's Achilles ' heel . He was so tremendously advanced in most ways , perhaps it was churlish to wish he had been more advanced about his source of labor . Then again , Harry wondered what would happen if the shoe were on her foot : Would she be able to refuse a skilled labor force ? She would need to house them , clothe them , feed them , and provide medical care . Not that any of that was cheap , and maybe in today 's dollars it would add up to more than a living wage . Still , the moral dilemma if one was white , and Harry was white , nagged at her . Nonetheless , Mim had provided the driving energy behind this project , and its progress was a great personal victory for her . She had also made the largest financial contribution to it . Her adored only son had sped away from Crozet to marry a sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the color of cafe au lait . For years Mim had refused her son entry to the ancestral mansion , but two years ago , thanks to a family crisis and the soft words of people like Miranda Hogendobber , Big Marilyn had consented to let Stafford and Brenda come home for a visit . Confronting one 's own prejudices is never easy , especially for a person as prideful as Mim , but she was trying , and her efforts to unearth this portion of Monticello 's buried history were commendable . Harry 's eyes swept the room . A few Jefferson descendants were in attendance . His daughters , Martha and Maria , or Patsy and Polly as they were called within the family , had provided T.J. with fifteen grandchildren . Those surviving out of that generation in turn provided forty-eight great-grandchildren . The names of Cary , Coles , Randolph , Eppes , Wayles , Bankhead , Coolidge , Trist , Meikleham , and Carr were carrying various dilutions of Jefferson blood into the twentieth century and , soon , the twenty-first . Tracing one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit like tracing every Thoroughbred 's history back to the great sires : Eclipse , 1764 ; Herod , 1758 ; and Matchem , 1748 . Nonetheless , people did it . Mim Sanburne herself adamantly believed she was related to the great man on her mother 's side through the Wayles/Coolidge line . Given Mim 's wealth and imperious temperament , no one challenged her slender claim in the great Virginia game of ancestor worship . Harry 's people had lurched onto Virginia 's shores in 1640 , but no intertwining with Mr. Jefferson 's line was ever claimed . In fact , both her mother 's family , the Hepworths , and her father 's seemed content to emphasize hard work in the here and now as opposed to dwelling on a glorious past . Having fought in every conflict from the French and Indian War to the Gulf crisis , the family believed its contributions would speak for themselves . If anything , her people were guilty of reverse snobbery and Harry daily fought the urge to deflate Mim and her kind . Once she had overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Marilyn that she was loath to relinquish it . Finally , Oliver Zeve began the applause , which drowned out Mim 's oratory , although she continued to speak until the noise overwhelmed her . She smiled a tight smile , nodded her appreciation -- not a hair out of place -- and sat down . Mim 's major fund-raising victims , Wesley Randolph and his son Warren , Samson Coles , and Center Berryman , applauded vigorously . Wesley , a direct descendant of Thomas Jefferson through Thomas 's beloved older daughter , Martha , had been consistently generous over the decades . Samson Coles , related to Jefferson through his mother , Jane Randolph , gave intermittently , according to the fluctuations of his real estate business . Wesley Randolph , fighting leukemia for the last year , felt a strong need for continuity , for bloodlines . Being a Thoroughbred breeder , this was probably natural for him . Although the cancer was in remission , the old man knew the sands in the hourglass were spinning through the tiny passage to the bottom . He wanted his nation 's past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wesley 's slender grasp on immortality . After the ceremony Harry and Mrs. Hogendobber returned to Oliver Zeve 's house , where Mrs. Murphy and Tee Tucker , Harry 's tiger cat and Welsh corgi respectively , awaited her . Oliver owned a fluffy white Persian , one Archduke Ferdinand , who used to accompany him to Monticello to work . However , children visiting the shrine sometimes pestered Archduke Ferdinand until he spit and scratched them . Although the archduke was within his feline rights , Oliver thought it best to keep him home . This was a great pity , because a cat will see a national shrine with a sharper eye than a human . Then , too , Archduke Ferdinand believed in a hereditary nobility that was quite at odds with Jefferson 's point of view . As of this moment the archduke was watching Mrs. Murphy from a vantage point at the top of the huge ficus tree in Oliver 's living room . Kimball , who accompanied them , exclaimed , " The female pursues the male . Now , I like that idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . Archduke Ferdinand is not my type . " The Archduke growled , " Oh , and Paddy is your type ? He 's as worthless as tits on a boar hog . " Mrs. Murphy , conversant with her ex-husband 's faults , nonetheless defended him . " We were very young . He 's a different cat now . " " Ha ! " the Archduke exploded . " Come on , Mrs. Murphy , I think you 're wearing out your welcome . " Harry leaned over and scooped up the reluctant tiger cat who was relishing the archduke 's discomfort . Oliver patted Harry on the back . " Glad you could attend the ceremony . " " Well , I 'm not . We did n't see a single thing ! " Harry 's little dog grumbled . Mrs. Hogendobber slung her ponderous purse over her left forearm and was already out the door . " A lot of goodwill come from Mim 's check . " Kimball smiled as Harry and Mrs. H. climbed into the older woman 's pristine Ford Falcon . Kimball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things that fascinated Harry about the four distinct seasons in central Virginia was the quality of the light . With the advent of spring the world glowed yet retained some of the softness of the extraordinary winter light . By the spring equinox the diffuse quality would disappear and brightness would take its place . Harry often walked to the post office from her farm on Yellow Mountain Road . Her old Superman-blue pickup , nursed throughout the years , needed the rest . The early morning walk awakened her not just to the day but to the marvelous detail of everyday life , to what motorists only glimpse as they speed by , if they notice at all . The swelling of a maple bud , the dormant gray hornet 's nest as big as a football , the brazen cries of the ravens , the sweet smell of the earth as the sun warmed her ; these precious assaults on the senses kept Harry sane . She never could understand how people could walk with pavement under their feet , smog in their eyes , horns blaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings fraught with rudeness if not outright danger . Considered a failure by her classmates at Smith College , Harry felt no need to judge herself or them by external standards . She had reached a crisis at twenty-seven when she heard her peers murmur incessantly about career moves , leveraged debt , and , if they were married , producing the firstborn . Well , at that time she was married to her high school sweetheart , Pharamond Haristeen , D.V.M. , and it was good for a while . She never did figure out if the temptations of those rich , beautiful women on those huge Albemarle County farms had weakened her big blond husband 's resolve , or if over time they would have grown apart anyway . They had divorced . The first year was painful , the second year less so , and now , moving into the third year of life without Fair , she felt they were becoming friends . Indeed , she confided to her best girlfriend , Susan Tucker , she liked him more now than when they were married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the divorce . She finally calmed down and took up the task of matchmaking , trying to set up Harry with Blair Bainbridge , a divinely handsome man who had moved next door to Harry 's farm . Blair , however , was on a fashion shoot in Africa these days . As a model he was in hot demand . Blair 's absence drew Fair back into Harry 's orbit , not that he was ever far from it . Crozet , Virginia , provided her citizens with the never-ending spectacle of love found , love won , love lost , and love found again . Life was never dull . Maybe that 's why Harry did n't feel like a failure , no matter how many potentially embarrassing questions she was asked at those Smith College reunions . Lots of squealing around the daisy chain was how she thought of them . But she jumped out of bed every morning eager for another day , happy with her friends , and contented with her job at the post office . Small though the P.O. was , everybody dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she enjoyed being at the center of activity . Mrs. Murphy and Tee Tucker worked there too . Harry could n't imagine spending eight to ten hours each day away from her animals . They were too much fun . As she walked down Railroad Avenue , she noticed that Reverend Herb Jones 's truck was squatting in front of the Lutheran church with a flat . She walked over . " No spare , " she said to herself . " They do n't pay him enough money , " Mrs. Murphy stated with authority . " How do you know that , smarty-pants ? " Tucker replied . " I 've got my ways . " " Your ways ? You 've been gossiping with Lucy Fur , and all she does is eat communion wafers . " Tucker said this gleefully , thrilled to prove that Herbie 's new second cat desecrated the sacrament . " She does not . That 's Cazenovia over at St. Paul 's . You think every church cat eats communion wafers . Cats do n't like bread . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her eat a doughnut . ' Course , I 've also seen her eat asparagus . " Tucker marveled at the gargantuan appetite of Market Shiflett 's cat . Since she worked in the grocery store next to the post office , the gray animal was constantly indulged . Pewter resembled a furry cannonball with legs . Mrs. Murphy leapt on the running board of the old stepside truck as Harry continued to examine the flat . " Does n't count . That cat will eat anything . "
