Right in front of everyone at Two-Bit 's Worth , my last girlfriend called me unfit to drink in public , and I told her she was heavyset and that , after three months dating , I had come to realize she would always be heavyset . In this ugly way she walked out of my life for good . I was twenty-seven . After that I was single for two years straight . I 'd had troubles before holding a steady job , and I 'd scraped with the law under circumstances that resulted in fines and community service , but nothing can hollow your soul like spending dark hours with a radio you 're reluctant to turn off , imagining a night deejay as being exactly too beautiful for the man you are . Old romances that should have amounted to something I 'd think through backwards , from last fights to prefucking , like starting a pencil at the end of the maze and tracing to all the possibilities in the center . <p> When Carol 's Tercel pulled into the lot of the repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the thickness of two quarters , I was at the bottom of a cruel and lonely place . Carol was thirty-six and alone in the world except for a son named Tommy , who was five years old . There was a crazy ex-husband recently out of the picture-a refrigerator and air-conditioner repairman out west-and in the space of an afternoon , Carol had fled with Tommy , from her home and the people who embodied her life , in the hopes of never laying eyes on the man again . All this she 'd told me a few hours into our first date , while Addicted to Sacrifice was between band sets . Shaking my head gravely as I listened , what I was saying was , " It disgusts a normal guy like me that this whacko loser son of a bitch poisoned love for you-let me show you better . " But there was also an instant when I might have understood the guy . Carol was a slender , attractive woman with shimmery auburn hair and expressive eyes whose purple sometimes blew your mind , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen years earlier , the kind that could set your heart on fire if you tried to love her . <p> We were on her bed one night while the ten-o'clock Creature Double-Feature finished up on the small rabbit-eared set across from us . There was a metallic funneling sound behind the walls from air-pocketed radiator piping , whose fluctuating heat had left me under a sheet in my boxers and Carol on the spread in her terry-cloth robe . We were holding hands and had been like that for some hours , resting . <p> Carol had just finished telling me about a car accident on I-84 that morning in which one of the men involved pulled the other out of his car and beat him with his fists all around the median . " What you realize , " she was saying , " what breaks your heart is that people can kill each other over spare change . You could see in the way the first one circled his car that he was psyching himself up to be so pissed . Like he needed to concentrate on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " You work off an adrenaline fix . " <p> Carol finished her beer and set it on the nightstand . " It 's because hating someone is n't a natural feeling . It 's not something we 're born with . I love you without having to try , and I love Tommy that way . But hate is different . You have to teach yourself to feel hatred . Or get driven to it , I guess . " <p> Love was something we had n't spoken yet , and hearing it now I felt the first sensation of doubt , a light sweat , a tickle in the gut . It was old , suddenly familiar . And it involved leaving someone for the false notion of someone else , a woman younger or prettier , like a sure thing on the rim of your life . Though now the feeling passed more quickly than it ever had and I was slightly exhilarated . " Tell me that again , " I said . <p> " You mean love ? " She tilted her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does n't bite , Jerry . I love you . There . And if I held back because I was worried how you 'd take it , I 'd be a bullshitter . " She placed my hand next to me , clicked off the TV , and got out of bed . At the far end of the room , she opened one of the bifold closet doors and brought out a golf club . " I do n't know what other virtues are intact ; ' she said . " But no one can call me a bullshitter . " <p> " That 's the virtue worth keeping . " I considered my beer on the nightstand , but the buzz I 'd established had a resilient attitude so I let it go warm . <p> Carol set down a handful of dimpled white balls across from a rubber putting cup . Her first shot nicked the side bank , mostly the fault of a stretch of floor whose boards , worn rough of varnish , pitched in the centers . The ball floundered back out and stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised me . She said , " Because you 're a mechanic , I think . You understand the inner workings , the tiny triggers that get the big results . It 's that you think with patience . " <p> " I love you back " I said , and it occurred to me that the people around I knew , some even that I felt inferior to , were bitter at heart and lonesome . <p> " I 'm newly in love with a man who can speak , she said . Her fingers closed like falling dominoes around the club grip . " Now there 's a blue-moon idea . " Behind her the bedroom door rattled with sudden force and startled us both . The knob was loose in its stile , and could n't twist enough to open . When Carol saw me about to say something , she held out her hand . " Get in the closet . " <p> " Carol . " <p> " Jerry , please . I ca n't think . " <p> I pulled on my pants absently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to last longer than I wanted . In the closet I steadied myself between her hung blouses , breathing air congested with vanilla perfume and static , and watched through the middle louvers . When the bedroom door opened , Tommy burst across the threshold and latched onto Carol 's leg . He was wearing maroon sweatpants and no shirt . He coughed and shivered , tears spraying from his lips . " Screamed . . , " he said . " Screaming at me , Mommy . " In the narrow rectangle of what I could see , his face was sunken and bloodless , the sideways figure-eight of his mouth tremoring . And I thought then that nothing can ready you to see such a look of terror on a boy . I 'd seen that look once before , on the face of an acquaintance I 'd been drinking with who was my age or possibly older , a few minutes before he went to the police to turn himself in . Like things can somehow go worse than you imagined . <p> Carol received Tommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the room . There was an ease about her like she 'd known these nights before , though I could n't say , since I 'd been sleeping at her apartment only once a week , and for less than a month . As I adjusted my footing , a plastic hanger scraped my neck , and I fought it off without turning . Her eyes stopped at points along the floor as if measuring distances . I wiggled my finger between two louvers and scratched the paint just a little . It seemed like enough sound for someone who knew I was in there , but she did n't look in my direction . And all at once I felt laughed at or as though my manhood had been challenged . I pulled my finger back and counted to five . Then I opened the closet door and stepped out . <p> Carol closed her eyes for a moment after she 'd seen me , and when she opened them , her look was vague , though I did n't think angry , and I said , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from his mother and tried to break free , but Carol took a firm hold around his waist . " Look , honey , " she said . " It 's only Jerry " <p> " It 's only me , " I said . His face was wet with tears , sticky tracks of them down the bell of his midget pot belly . His red hair matted dark across his forehead . " Let go , " he screamed , writhing against his mother 's grip . He slapped the fat bottom of his hand against her side . " I hate you , Mommy ! " <p> " Easy , partner , " I said , and his shoulder blade moved and stiffened when I touched it . When he looked at me , his expression seemed dazed , as though only now he 'd woken from the dream , as though I were his first piece of what was real but he did n't know where to fit me in . " How come you came here , Jerry ? " he said . I smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carol frowned and took him in a loose hug . Tommy watched me step back as he lifted his hands around his mother 's neck , and I was pinned inside long embarrassing seconds . " I do n't want him , " he said , his voice easier now . Something had calmed him . " Let 's take me back to bed , " he said . <p> When Carol came in and closed the door , I was back under the sheet . She went to the window and lifted it open . From the chainlinked courtyard outside , white December air curled in in a thin wave , and somewhere nearby a car chirped its tires and tore off . <p> " It was a nightmare about before , was n't it ? " I said . " It was about your ex-husband . " <p> From the top drawer of her bureau Carol found a black tube , the kind used for camera film , and brought it to the window with a pack of matches . She sat on the floor and pulled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closet . " <p> " I 'm a stranger around here , " I said . " You know what I 'm saying ? Hell , the kid does n't even like me . " I thought about going in the living room and turning on the TV . I thought about cracking a few beers . " I 'm not going to worry about it , " I said . <p> Carol took a marijuana joint out of the tube and lit it , closing her eyes with the first hit , and though a few tokes would have done me no harm , she was n't offering any . She let the smoke out the window . " His face is so peaceful when he 's sleeping , " she said . " You 'd wish the demons could just stay away . " She hit three times then tapped the end of the joint and dropped it into the tube . " You can never outlive your past . Did n't somebody have that carved on their gravestone ? " <p> " I could n't tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see that the thing we 'd ended up on different sides of was over for her now . There did n't have to be more unless I was starting . She untied her robe and compressed her shoulders so that it fell all at once to coils around her ankles . " Here I am , " she said , her voice soft and matter-offact . I smiled because it was something she 'd said before , the night after our first date , when from the bathroom she paused in the bedroom doorway , unexpectedly naked as I bobbled off my jacket and shoes . She was a small woman , petite , spare and bony in the hips , though she 'd gone through childbirth . There was a dryness to her skin I associated with age , and her breasts dimpled into all their freckles under a light touch . On the inside of her thigh she had this tattoo of a swan , a simple , stringy figure , blackgreen like an old bruise . <p> Carol spun the alarm dial of the clock radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay beside me and took my hand and placed it near her navel , over a crescent of stretch mark like rough wood to the touch . She turned off the bedstand lamp so that light from a pole on Connecticut Avenue lipped in over the ceiling and gave us silver outlines . <p> " It wo n't get easier later on , " I said , intending that to be the last word of it . <p> Carol was quiet , though I could feel her nodding slowly , and the thing she was staring at , which I trained my own eyes on , was a funnel of cobweb riding drafts in a ceiling corner . For entire minutes it would n't connect its sticky reach or let go . She turned to me , and we made love with exhausted minds and bodies . After , she touched my lips with a finger . " Give us a while , " she said . " We 're still okay . " And it seemed too late by then to tell anything but the truth . I closed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of insignificant dreams I had n't known in years . <p> Carol liked to call me at Doc 's Motorwerke during her half-hour between work and picking up Tommy from daycare . I planned my lunch break around this time , in the parts room where there was a swivel chair and a desk to put my feet on . Our shop had an arrangement with a halfway house on the north end of Bridgeport , and the mechanics they sent us wore gold studs in their noses and knew more about breaking into cars than fixing them . I pulled them off commission jobs for warranty work , and they cocked me the kinds of looks you 'd be a fool to turn your back on . So when one of them came in for a computer sensor or spark plugs , I 'd say something sweet to Carol over the phone . It was cheap , I knew , but in a way it made me feel lucky . She would call from Sikorsky 's , where she inventoried gears and fasteners for military helicopters . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me her small plans for the night , I imagined massive ceramic vats behind her , catching red fountains of molten iron . <p> On the day of the first real snow , Carol put together her Christmas tree and invited me over to have a look . It was a white hemlock imitation with spiraled wire for a trunk , the kind stores will buy in bulk for their own decoration . The balls were solid blue and solid silver , which gave the tree an ordered look not very friendly or cozy . But the dark imitation paneling in the living room was better for the blinking lights , and I told her it was pretty . I 'd brought a quart of eggnog that turned out to be rotten , so I ran across the street to Larry 's Liquor Locker for a six-pack of beer . <p> After dinner Carol needed to make a few phone calls , so I went out into the living room with Tommy to watch TV . Usually he was set for bed by the time I came over , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamped by upholstery creases , blinking indifferently at me while his mother carried him off to bed . I volunteered a comfortable distance of sofa between us , and Tommy married himself to the screen , to the dentist elf setting out for the Island of Misfit Toys . Two Christmas cards were butted together over the TV , and I noticed that one of them was the same wish for peace and prosperity People 's Bank had sent me . On the wall across from us were two framed photographs of white-tail deer , antlered bucks poised in haughty stances over rugged , snowblanketed country . <p> " That 's what I want , " Tommy said at the television , where a toy commercial ran . " Only the green kind with the other buttons . " He did n't seem to have anyone in mind he was saying this to , though after a while he looked at me . A beer rested between my legs , and I had been peeling off pieces of the label and setting them on the coffee table . " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirt pistol ? " Tommy stared at me vacantly until my question lost meaning , and we were involved in the kind of complex quiet where if one of you does n't smile soon , some meanness will probably come out of it . A tightrope quiet , you call it . So I smiled . Tommy waved me near , and I leaned in . " You should have a dog , " he said into my ear . And then with his cold hands , he pulled my face closer and kissed me in an area under my eye , a small , wet kiss . It made me awkward , the way you feel in a public place catching a woman breastfeeding , like it 's innocent enough but just the same . Tommy opened his hand over my forehead , pushed me lightly back . <p> " A dog ; " I said , ticking my tongue with nothing else to say . I cleared my throat . " Did you have a dog ? " <p> " Roxy first . We got Ginger after . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair lifting with static . Then he laughed a mighty shout of a laugh . " Once Daddy put Ginger in the bathtub with me and my mommy . Cause she was mudd-eee . Mudd-eee ! " <p> A door clicked shut down the hall in the direction of Carol 's room . I took a drink of my beer . Tommy was watching me . " Where is Ginger now ? " I said . " Does your daddy have Ginger ? " <p> Tommy climbed onto the armrest and in his alligator slippers steadied himself . He bounced knees-down off the cushions , and then he got up and did it again . It was like he 'd gotten into rocket fuel . " Ginger drinked antifreeze , " he said , fidgeting now with a throw pillow . He heaved it high over his head and slammed it against his thighs . He did this a few times until he was red in the face , and just before he hurled the pillow at the TV screen , he yelled once for each slam , " **26;902;TOOLONG : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitated idle , like someone trying to outlast the shakes , and his program had been running , but both of us were staring with surprise and curiosity at the dustblown place where the Christmas cards had been . <p> " Do you need your mom now ? " I said . I was n't angry and did n't want to come off as if I were . I guessed he 'd just had some sort of episode . Tommy hesitated a moment , then shook his head no . He wiped his mouth on his wrist . Solemnly he said , " Ginger sometimes bited Mommy . " He looked at the tree while opening and closing a small fist to the pulsing of the lights , and then underneath , at the shaggy cotton skirt without any presents on it . <p> " It 's okay , Tommy , " I said . " It 's okay for dogs because the secret is they ca n't really feel it . " And as he nodded , all his flat little teeth shown in his smile . " Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a modest up-and-down , and handling his random squeezes with light but steady pressure . I was teaching this to him . " That 's it , " I said . And I thought about his father then , the man Tommy may have resembled , who through jealousy or greed or something worse had lost his family and a future worth believing in . <p> When Carol stopped in front of the television , the snowbeast was toothless and unoffending as a lamb . She surveyed the room and looked at Tommy . " I 'm mixed up with a couple of crazies , " she said , and Tommy laughed and said , " Crazies . " Carol gathered the fallen cards in an unhurried manner and set them back . " I thought I was getting a cold before , " she said . Her eyes were pinkrimmed and a little swollen , though she may have been smoking in her room . " You look run-down , " I said without thinking . <p> " My prom queen days are behind us now , " Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throw pillow off the floor and sat between us . Tommy crawled half into her lap , and she tousled his hair . " And you 've got a voice that could drop a mountain , mister , " she said , and she made him laugh , squeezing at his sides . " God , Mommy . Oh God , Mommy , " he said . <p> I finished my beer and went into the kitchen for another , and one for Carol , and I thought about running out for another sixpack . Through the sink window , dense snow leaned in sideways and a primered Monte Carlo wound for traction up the small hill Carol lived on . Police sirens began weakly , as though they were in my head , then peaked distinctly in wide rolling pulses . A few blocks in the direction of Father Panik Village , they dropped off , and I watched the stormy night with a satisfied sense of being far removed from the cold city . <p> Tommy was riled again when I joined them on the sofa , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . His frenzy now , dancing beside his mother , his hand gripping at her shoulder , was n't any less enthusiastic than his frenzy before with me . " There 's that caterpillar , " he said at another commercial . " If you have him you could walk him like a doggy . I knew it . I knew that was him . " When his foot caught between cushions , Tommy lunged forward , tearing the gold chain from Carol 's neck . I thrust an arm between his head and the coffee table just as Carol pulled him back into her lap . My beer foamed over , and I hopped up . " Shit . " I scraped icy lather from my jeans onto the braided rug . " Rotten kids do n't get presents , " I said . " Look at this crap . " <p> Tommy saw something in me that made him reel back . " I am a good boy , " he said , his eyes darting and glistening . " We 're running away , and not you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He opened his arms to his mother , and when she took him against her , Carol narrowed her eyes at me . " Just steal his Christmas away from him , " she said . With Tommy in her arms , she began rocking slightly . He said something in her ear , and she nodded and whispered something back . <p> " I apologize , " I said . " I was out of line . I 'm sorry to both of you . " <p> " It 's by your foot , " Carol said . I scooped the small gold cross from her necklace off the rug and handed it to her . " Listen , " I said to Tommy . He hesitated and finally loosened from his mother , and I took a moment to remember things right . I told him about the time my father 's Christmas present to me was two fifty-cent pieces . Only the way he did it was he put them in a small box , then that one in a bigger one , on and on . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing set . Smaller and smaller I went , tearing the boxes open in a rage , and my father had been drinking and thought it was the funniest thing ever . " So there I was , " I said , " all these boxes around me , and a dollar to show for it . " I took a long sip of my beer , and Carol shook her head in a pleasing way that said I was forgiven . <p> But Tommy had frozen , his mouth agape . " It was a gag , " I said . He crawled over Carol , got to his feet , and touched me on the shoulder . His eyes found mine and waited there like he did n't know how to tell me something awful . " But when , " he said . <p> " I was a kid . Little . " <p> He slapped a hand at the air between us . " When did he give you the race cars ? " <p> Carol and I were out on the porch of her duplex smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were just talking , one thing to the next . It was colder than hell . <p> " He had some nice Chevelles , " Carol said . " They used to race . For money , pink slips , whatever . That was the thing in California . " <p> " Was his name Tom ? " <p> " Rick , " she said . " That 's Tommy 's first name . Richard Thomas McLean . " She rubbed her arm , and a small bouquet of sparks shot off her Winston . " He gave me this tattoo ; ' she said , pointing her chin to where it was under her jeans . " He did it himself . " <p> Leaning against the railing , I tore strings of wood from a rotted baluster . After drugging her up , he scribbled that sloppy mark , his mark , I thought , like a mutt staining its territory . I took a few long drags of my cigarette . " He raced pro ? " <p> She smoothed a small pouch under her eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out in the desert where he could hold it right to the floor . Past the red line . You could smell them burning up , oil or rubber , that kind of smell . Like any minute it would all just explode . " <p> " Sounds like a winner , " I said . I imagined him in a bandanna cap and Harley-patched leathers , enterprising in a weight room , quiet around men but intense . Someone , though , who had his limitations like anyone else on God 's green earth . What keeps a man from acting out of his dignity is the capacity to know this when the dangerous moment finally comes . " Sounds like a real Boy Scout , " I said , the skin of my throat coppery in the thin air . <p> She shrugged and dropped her shoulders . " Life had a different set of rules back then . " From somewhere not far beyond us , a woman sent a child 's name into the night . Carol turned toward the sound , to ashy darkness over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after a few moments , the calling ended . Between cloud cover , a patch of stars hung upon us like chips of ice . Then Carol said , " Do you think it 's funny the way I am with my son ? Peculiar , I mean . Do you think I raise him in a way that 's peculiar ? " <p> " No , " I said , and shook my head to make it definite . It was n't something I 'd given much thought to . I flicked my cigarette into the street . " Let 's go inside , " I said . <p> Carol scooped her hair back with one hand so that her face seemed narrow and drawn , and she paused , watching me watch her . " Sometimes you worry about our ages , do n't you , Jerry . You worry it will reach a point where you do n't find me attractive anymore and you wo n't be able to say it . " <p> " Jesus , Carol . " <p> She dropped her cigarette and ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want you to know that I 'm brazen to that , to that and about anything else you could throw at me . It 's all right . And if you were seeing someone else right now , that would be all right , too . " <p> " What the hell does that mean ? " <p> " I never asked for commitment , Jerry , " she said . " Just eventemperedness : ' She pulled her hands back in the cuffs of her jacket , and the funny thing was that right then , she looked younger to me . Girlish . She looked like someone I 'd never met . <p> I went back inside . Tommy was belly down in front of the TV , cheeks on palms on elbows . I had on the Brotherhood of the Right silk-screened jacket I 'd won off a retired member in a card game , and Tommy turned to watch me take it off . He liked the smell of leather , and I knew he wanted to hold it . " What ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got off the floor and ran down the hallway toward his room . " I 'm not in a mood , " I said after him . His door slammed . " I 'm not in any goddamn mood . " I threw the jacket on the couch and went into the bathroom . <p> The exhaust fan droned as I paced and finally opened the medicine cabinet over the sink . I did n't know what I was doing . MintFlavored Fluoride Gel , Band-Aids that said Adhesive Strips for Cuts and Scrapes . On the top shelf were two prescription bottles , Erythromycin and Tranxene . NO REFILL was typed under her name on the second bottle , and I could judge by its weight it was almost empty . Two things suddenly came to my attention : the cabinet 's contents I 'd been lining on the edge of the sink and Carol at the open door . <p> She took the bottle from me , knocked one of the blue pills onto her palm , and brought it to her mouth . " I wonder , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that day at your shop , I should have just paid for the brake job and drove away clean . Or maybe I should have told you to give me love in small increments . " <p> " I did n't deserve that , " I said . I folded my arms and looked at the brown grout between the tiles . <p> " You did n't , " she said . She closed the door behind her as if she had some further action in mind , but she seemed to lose purpose . Her hands found her front pockets , and she sighed . " I waitressed at a truck stop for three years , " she said , " and I thought that was the lowest point of my life . I still think that . And what I remember is that you wo n't spill coffee if you do n't watch yourself carrying it . Is n't that a telling thing ? Three years of my life , and that 's where it got me . " She looked at me , and I realized I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . " Will you come here ? " And we hugged then in a way we 'd never done before and did n't again after that night . <p> Four days before Christmas , Carol was making dinner for us . I 'd come over late , and Tommy had already eaten . He was sleeping in the living room , which was pretty much the routine , as was her carrying him to bed while I set up a movie . Some nights , she would stay with him for half an hour . I 'd get up and start walking toward the door , to peek in on what was happening , but the wooden hallway flooring creaked like crazy . I 'd soft-foot back to the sofa and wait it out . <p> Carol shook chicken legs in a baggy while I sat at the table with torn-out pages of K-Mart and Bradlees circulars strewn around me . I had an assignment . She 'd circled pictures of toys-a talking Barney doll , a preschool tape recorder , that sort of thing-and my part was to scissor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree Christmas morning for Tommy to find with notes from Santa . The next day they 'd take the clippings to afterChristmas sales and get everything half-price or better . <p> We were in the middle of dinner when the phone rang . Carol answered it and thanked the other person for returning her call . She brought the phone to the counter by the sink and went through her purse . When she found her credit card , she read the numbers out loud , and then said what I assumed to be her mother 's maiden name-the security code for inquiries . " Who did ? " she said . " Where did you send the bill ? The address . " Her resulting silence stretched long minutes , and I set down my fork and came behind her . The phone receiver shook slightly in her hand , her thumb pressed against the button to end the connection . She set the receiver down on the counter . <p> " Rick ? " I said . Carol faced the kitchen windows that against the night had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said and turned on the sink faucet . " Jesus , what an idiot thing . Anytime at all he could have taken my card numbers . " The water started running out of the pot , taking all the soap with it , but she did n't shut it off . <p> " So he knows the state you live in , " I said , thinking through it . " Maybe the town . " The phone started buzzing , and I hung it up . " All right . We 're just going to hang fire and see what happens . I 'll run home and get some clothes packed . " <p> I waited for a reaction from Carol because I was excited then and felt this development would connect us in a positive way . In the window reflection , I could see the strange white of her eyes as she looked down into the sink . I grew aware of a cool lightening through my chest and upper body . Suddenly it was easy to think in terms of violence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with it , " I said . <p> " I do n't need a hero 's trouble , Jerry . " <p> I went back to the table and slammed my chair . Still holding its back , I saw the tendons in my wrist swollen like wires . " This is shit , " I said . <p> " Maybe I do n't understand you ; " Carol said , turning from the sink , looking at me point-blank . " Maybe you know just what to do if he found you here . I guess it does n't matter . " She crossed her arms and after a few moments let go of a breath . " Tommy told you about Ginger the other night-he screamed it for half of Bridgeport . " <p> " The fucker poisoned your dog . There you go . " <p> " It was n't any antifreeze , " she said . " Rick hung Ginger by the throat off a garage rafter . And it was because I told him to get rid of her . Me . " She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been near tears . " I married him once , " she said . " I used to love him , and I was a monster myself . That 's what I have to live with . You 're not a part of that : ' <p> " Running away is letting him win . Do you understand that ? Someone 's got to teach him what he is . " <p> Carol pinched the bridge of her nose . She closed her eyes and slowly opened them . " I 'll run , " she said , her voice now flat with resolve . " If it comes down to that , we 'll run . " She looked at the doorway , and Tommy appeared . It was like she knew his mind . I went over to him , and he squinted at the kitchen light . " We need a couple minutes , " I said . His eyes were shiny and small , and he did n't move . " Go on , now , " I said . <p> Tommy touched the helmets on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wet down his leg . " It 's warm , Mommy , " he said . <p> " Terrific , " I said , " just goddamn terrific . What the Christ . " <p> " Let 's get you in the bathroom , " Carol said , and she turned off the sink water . " I 'll be there in a minute . " Tommy did what he was told , and when he was out of the room , Carol said , " I want you to leave . " <p> " Nobody 's leaving . " <p> " Do n't turn it into a big thing , or I 'll hate you . " <p> " Listen a minute . He 's a stalker , for all I know . He 'll break in a window . " <p> " Do n't make me hate you , Jerry . " <p> I knocked over a chair and swore at its crash . I grabbed my jacket in the living room , pausing just short of the door . Carol had followed , stopping as I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her face I could see that she was only there to make sure , to throw the bolt behind me . And taking the knob then , I felt the way you do in a plane lifting off , when you 're between gravities and no one can tell you what will happen . As I stepped out into the steely slap of winter , I promised myself it was over . I 'd had enough . <p> Christmas fell on a Wednesday that year , and at noon when I pulled myself out of bed , it could as easily have been any other day . I mailed a card off to my mother and her new husband in Florida . Nothing but church services on TV . I drank to Jesus , and I drank to Mary . I drank to the doughy , black-bearded priest who warned against losing faith in the new year . Outside , the air was damp and rotten with the Sound at low tide , and I walked the block over to Two-Bit 's Worth . Behind the bar , Dex was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost expression when he saw me . Dex had been to prison in New Haven for stealing a snowblower , a crime enough to foul his record with the world but not one that afforded him any special respect from the rest of us . <p> There was n't anyone else in the bar I could see . " Somebody forgot to deck your halls ; ' I said . He set his soup can on the bar and aimed his good leg in my direction , following with a dragging bad leg . As he neared , something took shape along his jaw , tobacco somehow or food , but when he was right before me , I saw it was four black stitches . " Who won ? " I said . <p> He shook his head . " With the pool cues , last night . Christmas friggin ' eve . " Then he cracked a Heineken under the counter and dropped it in front of me . " Where the hell you been ? " he said . <p> One night I drove out to Carol 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the living room was dark . I parked two houses up and listened to the engine tick cool . I looked through my cassettes , straightened the glove box . I waited for inspiration . <p> I did n't need a black knit hat and shoe polish to sneak behind the place . There were no stars or moon . I looked first in her bedroom window . All the golf balls were gathered in the plastic cup . Empty boxes from grocery stores were stacked against the closet by her dresser , and her bed was made and empty . I tried to imagine us in there , holding each other , and when the vision came to me , a cold space opened in my chest . I moved on , through an elm sapling brittle as toothpicks . Tommy 's room was visible in an orange tent of nightlight , and in that soft place , he slept with an arm slung loosely over his new Barney doll . Carol knelt by his bed with her hands laced at his feet . In a moment she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't make out , words , I thought , that I had never heard her speak . And if she had cheated or had been otherwise to blame , it would have been all right with me then . I wanted to feel wronged and better for how things had turned , but the truth I could n't get away from was that in some important way I had only proven myself insufficient . She dropped her face a little closer to her hands , and I stayed watching until my breath misted everything away . <p> I went back out front to her Toyota and wormed my fingers in through the grill . I found the plastic-coated cable , traced it up to where bare wire was exposed , and pulled . The hood popped up to the latch . I did n't know exactly what I wanted to come of crossing her ignition wires . When you 've had everything and lost it , and when the process could have been changed by opening your mind or your heart in a difficult way , wishes diminish to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe she would call me at the shop the next morning , and that was the best I could hope for . <p> When I clicked the hood down , Carol was on her front porch with a cigarette . She did n't look surprised to see me . She must have been there awhile without letting on . <p> " I hope you did n't fuck things up too bad under there . " <p> " I 'll go fix it , " I said , but instead walked toward her . " Where are you going ? " <p> " Key Largo , if anyone asks , or Madagascar , " she said , and shook her head . " I 'm not even sure we 're going yet . It seems like a smart thing to be ready if we have to . " She stabbed her cigarette against the doorframe and flicked it away . " I 'm not going to ask you in tonight , Jerry . So you might as well get any of those ideas out of your head . But I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I stayed on the porch . I wished there was a present in my car I could give her . I 'd bought a pair of women 's cabretta golf gloves but returned them the day after Christmas . When she came back out , she handed me a card , its width the closest we 'd come to touching in eight days . It was homemade out of heavy red paper . Inside was a crayon drawing of a blue-haired man in a leather jacket standing by a Christmas tree . <p> " He made a bunch of them , " she said . " That one surprised me . " <p> " I did n't bring his present , " I said . <p> She pulled opened the door and stepped through . " I 'll tell him you got the card . " <p> The door closed , and I was alone with my steaming breath under the streetlight . I looked at the card again . The tree held three different crayons ' worth of ornaments . In the picture I was smiling . <p>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
