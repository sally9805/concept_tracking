Sober now , and stable , a comedian looks back on a young life marred by desertion , poverty , desperate sex and hard drinking // " You know you 've had a hell of a life when stardom is anticlimactic , " writes Brett Butler in her new autobiography , Knee Deep in Paradise , which could just as easily have been titled Memories of an Amazing Southern Gothic Girlhood . Abandoned at 4 by a mentally unbalanced father-not until she was 16 did Brett discover he had spent the ensuing years in a back room of his mother 's house in Tuskegee , Ala.Butler was raised by a loving but emotionally fragile mother who married three times and bore five daughters , all while struggling with suicidal depression . Butler herself waded through a swamp of bad relationships and became a blackout drunk before seeking help and straightening out-an accomplishment that makes her proud but not preachy . " All I did , " she says , " was stay alive long enough to do something I loved and get recognition for it . " Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF MY life waiting for two men I was reasonably certain would never come back : my daddy and Jesus Christ . I do n't wait for them anymore . My dad , anyway . And at least with Jesus I did n't spend all that time thinking he was gone because of something I did . In a way , after the first father leaves , the rest are easy . My dad was eccentric , peculiar and unprepared for reality . This worked out fine , because reality and my father were rarely on speaking terms . Roland Decatur Anderson Jr. , who later in life began to call himself Andy , was an adored , coddled , smart boy who was told time and again of his genetic , ancestral , downright predestined superiority among men . Saturate a child with that , then try not to imagine some deeply disturbing side effects . Carol Jean Parker , my mother , graduated from high school in Marietta , Ga. , the same year that my father graduated from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa . They married three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already there , my mother was too caught up in feelings to pay any heed . My memories of my father are scattered and fleeting . When I was 4 , Andy took a job as a vice president of public relations for the Humble Oil Company in Houston . He told everyone that this was his " big break . " The one he 'd been waiting for his whole life . It was all very sudden . We packed what we needed in the car and headed to Texas in the rain . Not long after finding an apartment , Andy began a vicious cycle of shopping , drinking , check-bouncing and alienating anyone who might be considered friendly . Whenever our mother became acquainted with anyone , even another young mother in our complex , he soon humiliated both of them , making further connections impossible . My mother says it was a coincidence that the date we left him was April 1 in 1962 . My father did not seem to see me and my two little sisters lined up in our good clothes by the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and said , " Girls , kiss your daddy goodbye . " He stooped down to hug us . I think it was the biggest hug he 'd ever given me . It was also the last . My mother decided to move us all to Miami . She thought the climate would be better for my little sister Toren 's asthma . So we packed up our little Fiat and drove off . Tiny pieces of the floorboard were missing , and I watched slivers of the road almost the whole time on the trip down to Miami . I thought that unless I watched the road as my mother drove , we would have a wreck . From that time on-until I was past 30-it felt like the entire family was my responsibility . I was getting sick of life , and I was only 5 . My mother was a kind and enthusiastic parent . We loved to make her laugh and did plenty of it . But then she began to date , and I resented it . I was young and could n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was not angry at any man for loving her , but for taking her away from us . So when she brought home someone who was special , I hated him most of all . His name was Joe , and one day we moved into a house with a dad dy and another life . My mother got pregnant , and the fact that Joe was already married witt three children of his own did n't seem to mar anyone 's happiness . Once , when my mom was very sick during her pregnancy , we went to stay with Joe 's wife . I thought she was kind of mean at the time , but I did n't know that she was still married to him eithen Looking back , I can not believe her kindness . Photograph * As a child , Brett ( at age 7 in Marietta , Ga. ) was " very smart and very good with words , " recalls mother Carol O'Quinn. // The first time I did standup comedy was at a school Christmas pageant when I was 8 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from The Ed Sullivan Show . My mother acted like every 8-year-old girl in the world wanted to be a comedian . Everyone in the audience seemed so happy with the little songs and poems of the other children . I was the first one to do something that was n't even remotely related to Christmas . When I started telling my jokes , the only sound I heard was my mother 's laughter in the back of the room . It was all the encouragement I needed . When it was over , I sat down and said to my mother , " They did n't understand the jokes . " Thank God I did n't think it was me . When I was 10 and we had moved to Marietta , Joe began to get calls from a woman . Before long , she was brave enough to leave her name , and I took the messages . The affair began to shadow our lives . I wondered when Mom would get mad enough to do something about it . For every pound she gained , for every nap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later at night . Pretty soon he left . Except for my mother 's deepening melancholy , I was glad . Photograph " She gave birth to my hyperbole and ranting comedy bits , " says Butler of Carol ( in her 1957 wedding picture with Brett 's father , Roland ) . // By the time I turned 14 , I was gravitating toward richer friends for reasons that had less to do with class warfare than permissiveness . They had the best pot , the best parties and the most indulgent parents . Other than that , the only thing I liked was boys . Boys were mythical lights that sparkled across the waters of loneliness . Boys were the promised land . I got my first job at the Dairy Queen . The white uniform I had to wear never seemed to wash clean . A hairnet and paper hat covered my only attribute , which was my hair halfway down my back . I looked like a polyester cotton ball with large thighs .

I was a " circulation draw clerk . " It was n't a sophisticated job , but it broadened my world to the point where school began to feel like day care . I loved going to work just to see who I could meet . After I 'd worked at the paper for a whole month I met " My First . " He was 18 and played guitar , even writing his own songs I started writing poems for him , and he would set them to music . Although I was five months short of being 15 and could not think of one wise woman who had given herself at such a young age , I was n't long for the world of chastity . My grandfather used to say , " Never do anything you would n't want to see on the front page of a newspaper . " Well , how the hell was I supposed to know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio were very good that summer , my diary entries were becoming repetitive , and right around the beginning of my sophomore year , I threw my virginity out of the speeding car that was my life . In 1974 , when I was 16 , my mother came into my room wearing the same expression she had the day she left my father . " We are going to Alabama to get some money in the trust fund , " she said . " I 'm sick and tired of never getting a dime from your father . " I did not ask why it was so important all of a sudden . I 'd known about the trust fund all my life . The amount of money in it varied wildly according to the source of information . Big Dad , my grandmother Julia 's father , had set it up . All we knew was that he left the money to his great-grandchildren . I felt bad that I 'd skipped a grade , showed subsequent academic promise and was now getting into college earlier than any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see about getting some money for college . It took a long time to recover from that day and figure out what happened to each of us . When we pulled into the driveway , Mom waited for a minute with her eyes closed . Then we strolled up to the front porch and knocked on the door . We waited , and then my mother began to knock loudly . Her knocks turned into pounding ; her voice became furious . Then my often **26;418;TOOLONG mother actually yelled , " Come out here , goddamnit , Julia ! I know you 're in there ! " Neighbors had started to peek out of lace curtains to see what was the matter . I wanted a beer , a joint , anything to make the moment pass . After almost half an hour , Julia finally came to the door . It was an awkward reunion . Julia pretended she had n't heard us because she had been listening to some ball game on the radio . Only in Dixie can such brazen bulls  --  t be bandied about between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantries in the hot , dark house until my mother , who had regained her composure , quite heroically , I thought , started to get to the subject of the trust fund . I began to squirm when Mother mentioned my upcoming stab at college . I told Julia that I was thirsty and started toward the kitchen . She fairly trembled as I went to the back of the house . I stood guzzling glasses of water , postponing my return to the honey-dripping warrior women . I took a paper towel from the roll to wipe my sweaty face . As I tossed it into the trash , I saw something shiny . Since that day I have wondered how not noticing that one small thing would have made a difference to my life . I moved some papers and saw some empty beer cans and a subscription card to Playboy underneath . My head reeled . I realized that my father was in the house with his mother , and that she had been hiding him all these years . I affected calmness as I brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the rest of the house . She started to sputter and said , " Sugah , ah had it closed off a long time ago . " I ignored her statement with a cool smile and left them to talk . I walked toward the back of the house . There were three doors facing the hallway from one side . I stopped in front of one of them . Even now I am not sure of the exact sound I heard . It could have been a little cough , a movement , a squeak . I am surprised I heard it past my beating heart . I knew my father was on the other side of the door . " Daddy ? " The word sounded so peculiar coming out of my mouth . I started talking to the door . I knew that he would not come out , but I had to tell him about myself . I could almost see myself outside of my own body , confiding my dreams to a wooden door . I finally started to cry , saying some very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't come out and see me . I am your oldest daughter . I 'm almost all grown up now . Do n't you ever want to see me ? " I heard my mother and Julia approach . Mom was saying , " Come on , honey . Let 's get out of here . " I told her , " He 's in there ! And he wo n't come out . " Then we left . We just left . I have cursed myself a thousand times for walking away . My mother feels the same . But it is too late for blame . I watched the house get smaller as my mother drove down the street . We went to a motel in Auburn for the night . I remember sneaking down to the hotel bar , getting really drunk and going to the rodeo with a man I met there , a man I was sure my snobby father would have hated , and then going back to his room and riding away the only way I knew how . A couple of months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . It was a nurse from the local hospital . She said , " Your mother has admitted herself for depression . " I thought , How odd . We have so much of it at home , why would she send out for it ? That was the beginning of our family 's final mutation . We were closing up , as if for a long winter that we sensed and did not speak of . Butler 's mother , who would later attempt suicide with an overdose of prescription pills , was in and out of mental hospitals during the next year . " My sisters were farmed out to relatives , and I was left on my own , " writes Butler , who began drinking heavily and experimenting with drugs . " I wanted to be strong , but I was becoming totally untethered . " My life at 16 was strange and drunk . I started having blackouts and began waking up with strangers . I got a job at a fast-food joint in a mall near Atlanta . The menial work involved the preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My life was in suspended animation . No one could reach me , and no one tried . Before long , I found speed too . I started with prescription amphetamines that I got from a friend , but I mostly ended up with the rotten little trucker pills that were just like having 20 cups of coffee at once . My college career , which began at a branch of the University of Georgia in 1975 , was a series of feeble attempts at being normal , until two weeks before finals , when I left . My mother had been released from the state mental hospital and was renting an apartment in Atlanta . She was happily dating the first guy any of us ever liked . As if leaving college before final exams was n't degrading enough , I got a job as a cocktail waitress at a hotel lounge and restaurant . Being a barmaid meant that I did n't have nasty sidework like filling up ketchup bottles . It also meant bigger tips . I thought some nice man would come in to have a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was another inglorious summer , and my wretchedness was increasing . I drank so much that by the time I got back to my apartment , half my tips had been spent at other bars . By the time I was 19 , I was poorer than ever and getting less connected to things that had been important to me . One day I came home to nothing but oatmeal in the pantry . Relish was the only condiment I had , so I put some along with salt and pepper in a bowl with the oatmeal . It was as bad as you 'd think . I threw myself on my bed and started sobbing . Just when I thought things could n't get any worse , the radio started playing " You Light Up My Life " by Debby Boone . It made me want to die , but since I also wanted to stick around and see how things turned out , I got up and threw the radio out the window After her abusive three-year marriage to Charles Michael Wilson ended in August 1981 , Butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new husband . There she discovered the Comix Annex , a smoky joint that boasted " the funniest comedians in Texas . " Determined to be one of them , Butler signed up for an audition and made her comic debut on Oct. 17 , 1981 . I 've often wondered if I would have started doing stand-up comedy if I had n't been drinking . I had tried every escape imaginable except those that could be considered healthy . One day , I woke up after a three-day bender , more colorful than most in that I left my car at one bar , my bra at another , and was lying in bed with a drunk girlfriend of mine . I went to make coffee and found in the yellow pages a selfhelp group for people who were trying to stop drinking . The woman who answered the phone said she would wait for me . Photograph " It 's an unruinable joy to do comedy , " says Butler ( taping a Showtime special ) . // She was still there , hours later , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read some of the things about what they did in those places and what they hoped to accomplish . I decided right then that I belonged with them . I wanted to be free . When I quit drinking , almost everything got better right away , but I knew I was n't sober as long as I smoked pot . At the end of 1989 , I quit that too . When I got completely straight for the first time , I added up how long I 'd been high , and it came to 17 years . I was amazed that I 'd accomplished anything at all . Butler had moved to New York City , where she met her second husband , Ken , when her grandmother Julia tried to drown herself in her bathtub in 1989 . Ten years earlier , Butler 's father had died . After moving Julia to a nursing home , Butler 's sister Toren packed up the contents of the house where her father had lived for l7years . She found Andy 's room cluttered with asthma inhalers , cigarette cartons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fine hand . " The best parts were tucked away in tiny pieces of paper or in the margins . I found comedy that my dad wrote . Not one-liners but twisted , pointy pieces for a wickedly erudite sort of person , " writes Butler " To this day those books are probably the most important things I 've ever gotten in my life . " A couple of summers after I got the books , I went to see my dad 's grave for the first time . Seeing his tiny tombstone was overwhelming . So many secrets felt lost inside that small piece of ground . Sometimes when I read something funny that my dad wrote in one of his books , I think about going down there and putting up a bigger tombstone , something with an epitaph befitting his glories , ignoring his mistakes . Other days , I feel like putting up a 10-foot-tall statue of Elvis just to screw with him . But I 'll leave him be . My father 's life was such an unfulfilled one . Once I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had been doing all those years in the back of that house . Just contemplating the remainder of that damned trust fund kept my father alive . It is the vision of my father , who waited so long for his own Godot , that makes me move forward when it is not my nature to do so . When I think I have no control over how my life turns out , I remember that I 've seen far sicker people get better . I also remember that I was one of them and that I still am , but that I do not have to live my life like a dying dreamer who accompanies herself into oblivion .
