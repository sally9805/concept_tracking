Ethan , Vanishing Years ago , on New Year 's Day , my older brother , Ethan , and I went skating on a river . No snow had fallen all that winter , and before Christmas we were hit with a week of windy , sub-zero days . The cold snap ended one late December evening , leaving a sky so clear that stars seemed to be trapped in the netlike branches at the top of each sugar maple . We woke next morning to pale sunlight and a windless twenty degrees . As it turned out , the year 's first snowstorm hit the Hilltowns a week later , but for a few days it was possible to skate on the Westfield River for miles and miles . It had been Ethan 's idea to try it . That fall we 'd each acquired secondhand hockey skates at the annual VFW ski-and-skate swap , held in Dalton . Ethan was ten and I was seven . We had been skating on the pond right near our house since late November . When Ethan heard from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked Mom to drive us over to Cummington , where the river runs right along Route 9 . She refused the request at first , but we explained that the Waltmans , even their parents , had gone skating on the river the day before . My mother knew the Waltmans , so she called them . Mr. Waltman said the river had been frozen to perfection , and that his boys had skated all the way to Chesterfield Gorge and back . Around noon on New Year 's Day , Mom parked her car in the Old Creamery Grocery lot . We tied our skates with the heat blasting , then she walked us both across Route 9 . We made our way down to the river , removed the rubber blade guards , and stepped out onto the ice . Mom seemed convinced the ice was safe , so she informed us that she 'd wait inside the Creamery , which was open . Ethan and I headed west on the frozen river . There were some rocks to dodge and logs to jump , but mostly we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour to reach the village of West Cummington , where we had promised we 'd turn back . By then I was freezing and my toes were numb . I knew the plan and I kept waiting for my brother to stop skating . But he kept going , right past the village , and only stopped where the river turns north and runs toward Windsor Jambs . Then he said , " What if we could skate right up to the Arctic Circle ? Would that be totally cool or what ? " I said , " We 'd probably die of frostbite . " Ethan said , " Actually , we 'd die of hypothermia . " I said , " Hey , maybe we 'd get eaten by a polar bear . " He said , " Or maybe we 'd just keep going , up to the North Pole then down through the Himalayas . That 's where a yeti would have us both for breakfast . " I do n't know why this conversation thrilled me . I kept on hearing it in my head as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , I kept hearing it weeks afterward . At random times throughout the rest of that long winter , he 'd ask me , " Hey , where do you think we 'd be right now if we kept skating ? " I 'd say the name of someplace in Canada . Or I 'd say , " Lost in the Himalayas . " Then Ethan would ask me what I thought would happen . I 'd shout out something like , " A pack of arctic wolves would tear our heads off ! " I never understood the point of the joke . I suppose we liked imagining all the ways we could get killed . And I suppose it did n't matter what gruesome deaths we conjured up , as neither one of us seemed to have any real plans for skating off into oblivion .  - -   - -  - When I was thirteen Ethan disappeared . It was a Saturday in late May , the first hot day we 'd had all spring . He peeked his head into my bedroom and said , " Hey , Baker 's Bottom ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Baker 's Bottom Pond was aptly named , given the doughlike quality of the mud on the pond 's floor . The mud was slimy and filled with leeches that would get between your toes . I pulled a beat-up pair of high-tops out from beneath a pile of shoes . I slipped them on just as Amy , the oldest of my three sisters , walked in the room . She said , " I thought I was driving you to your bird class . " I looked at Ethan and said , " Forgot . " Back then I lived for birds . I kept a list with every bird I saw , and I was up to 136 different species . " Maybe tomorrow ? " I said . " Doubtful . " He turned to Amy and said , " Hey , you 've got that look , like you wan na kill someone . " " I do , " Amy said . " But first I have to drive Philip to his bird class . " Ethan stepped toward her and whispered something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed down the stairs . We heard the screen door slam behind him . The sound startled our black cat , Meany , who had been sleeping on my desk . The cat jumped up , then settled down again . With his sandpaper tongue , he began licking his own shoulder . Glancing out my bedroom window , I saw my brother walking toward the bend in the gravel driveway . I turned to Amy , who had pulled a cigarette from her purse . She was holding it unlit between her fingers , her way of signaling that she wanted to leave that instant . " We 're doing warblers today , " I said . " They 're hard to tell . " She said , " That 's thrilling . " " Just changing back to my normal sneakers . " " I can see that , " Amy said . I tossed my pond sneakers in the closet . I slipped my running sneakers back on . When I stood up I looked outside again . My brother had disappeared . I do n't mean he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethan had walked down the driveway , the May sun glinting off the back of his yellow T-shirt . Then he was gone .
