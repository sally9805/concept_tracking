<p> Big is getting bigger on the American road . <p> American car makers , inspired by the recent popularity of big cars and trucks , are planning even larger models with equally gigantic sticker prices . Take the behemoth being tested by the Ford Motor Company , which , at 19 feet , would dethrone the Chevrolet and GMC Suburban by a foot as the longest mass-produced family vehicle ever built . <p> At more than three tons without cargo , or about twice the weight of a typical family car , this station wagon on steroids will also be one of the heaviest family vehicles . It will have an optional 6.8-liter V10 engine , twice the size of a typical mini-van engine . And it will seat eight adults in three rows and still have a sizable cargo area . <p> There will be no question who is king of the hill , said one person with knowledge of Ford 's product plans . Its customers , this person added , will be people wanting to tow a boat or have the biggest , baddest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so large and heavy that it exceeds the Government 's weight limits for classification as a light vehicle . That offers two little-known benefits for Ford and its customers . One is an exemption from the Federal luxury tax on high-priced cars and trucks  --  those costing more than $36,000 . The other is that the vehicle would not be covered by Federal fuel economy regulations written to discourage just the kind of gas guzzler Ford has in mind . ( The vehicle , which could cost as much as $40,000 , is two years away from mass production and Ford will not discuss it . ) <p> In the meantime , the march of the road hogs will only get bigger . <p> Chrysler is about to roll out a new Dodge Durango sport utility wagon that is roomier and more than a foot longer than the biggest Jeep . It is also planning an even bigger sport utility for the Mexican market , prompting whispers here that Chrysler may also sell it in the United States . But Chrysler says that is not planned . <p> Not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Suburban over the next two years to make it more appealing to families who want to treat it as an oversized car rather than a truck for towing boats and horse trailers . Also , BMW is apparently testing a sport utility wagon it may offer in a few years derived from its 5-series sedans . <p> Ford has expanded on its successful Explorer sport utility vehicle by building a larger Expedition model that went on sale last fall . And a big , plush sport utility version of its Lincoln luxury brand , called the Navigator , will go on sale in two weeks . <p> Safety groups are already expressing concern about Ford 's plans to build the even bigger , heavier vehicle , saying it could inflict a lot of damage in collisions with smaller , lighter cars . " From a public health vantage point , clearly it 's better not to have such a weight mismatch , " said Adrian K. Lund , senior vice president for research of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , a research group supported by insurance companies seeking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long made a point of designing vehicles that meet or exceed Government safety standards , but those standards are being reviewed as more Americans are being killed in collisions between cars and heavier vehicles . <p> Auto makers say they are simply meeting demand with supply . What sells these days are the biggest things in the showroom . Since 1990 , sales have climbed more than 60 percent for Suburbans , to 137,171 last year from 83,334 in 1990 . And there are waiting lists to buy them . Since Ford introduced the Expedition , its largest sport utility vehicle , it has nearly doubled production , to an annual pace of 240,000 , and still can not satisfy demand . The entire auto market , economists forecast , will have sales of 15.1 million cars , mini-vans , pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles this year . <p> People buy the big vehicles because they think they are safer , they want to ride above the traffic , intimidate others or simply want something bigger than what friends have . <p> Auto makers love to sell them because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10,000 each for a Suburban whose development costs have long since been recouped , analysts say . <p> The gigantic new models scheduled to roll out over the next two years are likely to have their devotees and detractors . The Transportation Department released a study last Tuesday concluding that big sport utility vehicles , pickup trucks and mini-vans posed a growing danger to the occupants of smaller cars sharing the same roads . And with fuel economy ratings of 14 miles a gallon or less and generally dirtier emissions , the new sport utility vehicles will generate more pollution and raise the nation 's reliance on imported oil , environmentalists warn . <p> Ford 's eight-seater crew wagon  --  so called because it can haul a construction crew  --  is based on its F-350 model truck . The truck comes in a variety of models , including pickup trucks , cabs for city delivery trucks and flat-bed trucks favored by landscape crews . A redesigned F-350 will go on sale next year . <p> In Chicago in February , Ford previewed the design of the truck by showing off its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickup with power running boards that folded down to help riders step up . That idea is not in production . <p> The big Ford wagon would not be the first " overweight " vehicle to escape the luxury tax , which is imposed on vehicles costing more than $36,000 but has exemptions for the very heaviest cars and trucks . The Toyota Land Cruiser , among others , is heavy enough when fully loaded to avoid the tax . And the Ford crew wagon would not be the first to escape fuel economy regulations , which exempt vehicles that weigh more than 8,500 pounds fully loaded . <p> At least two vehicles now escape both the tax and the fuel standards . Those are the heaviest Suburban models and the Hummer , a rough and ready sport utility vehicle adapted from a military transport built by AM General . <p> People with large or tall families , or who tow boats or trailers , buy many of the biggest vehicles . Pamela R. Staneck , an inn manager in Saugatuck , Mich. , said that she and her husband owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as shuttle buses , because a mini-van would not be big enough . <p> " We go to dog shows ; I play bagpipes ; we travel all over the place , " she said , adding that she and her husband , a hospital administrator , would like to buy a Suburban or something similar . " We 've always been wanting to get one , " she said . " We have a son who is 6 foot 4 inches and two Scottish deerhounds . " <p> In Cheyenne , Wyo. , Nick Nickel , a Ford dealer , said the people buying big vehicles in his area were not the farmers and ranchers pictured in some Suburban advertisements . The buyers are " primarily professionals : doctors , lawyers and accountants , " he said . Ranchers mostly prefer the more down-to-earth and more practical pickup trucks , he said . <p> While the ability of large vehicles to intimidate or impress other drivers may be debatable , there is a growing view that big sport utility vehicles provide excellent protection for their occupants and pose a hazard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , death rates in Chevrolet Suburbans are among the lowest for any vehicle on the road . But the institute is beginning a study on whether the proliferation of such large vehicles is increasing death rates in other vehicles that they hit , Mr. Lund said . <p> Because large sport utility vehicles typically come with four-wheel drive and high bumpers , they also tend to override the strongest sections of a car body and drive into the passenger compartment during collisions , the Transportation Department study warned last week . <p> Auto industry representatives emphasize the greater protection for occupants offered by heavy vehicles and reject suggestions that their big vehicles pose a safety problem or are impractical . " A lot of people do n't use all six seats in six-seat cars , " said Barry Felrice , the director of regulatory affairs at the American Automobile Manufacturers Association in Washington . <p> For Ford , the safety of its crew wagon may even become a selling point . " If you happen to get into a crash with a car , you probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the tires , " said the person familiar with the vehicle . " That 's kind of a comforting perspective , particularly if you have all your kids inside . " <p> With a gallon of gasoline now selling for considerably less than a gallon of bottled water , the cost of gas has largely disappeared as a worry for buyers of big vehicles . But even if gas prices rise , the Suburbans , Ford crew wagons and other rough , tough land yachts may not disappear . <p> The reason is simple : the people who can afford to pay $25,000 to $40,000 for a big sport utility vehicle can usually afford to fill their huge fuel tanks even if prices rise . One of G.M. 's envious rivals has done market research calculating that the average Suburban buyer earns $133,800 a year . The average car buyer earns just $67,100 a year .
