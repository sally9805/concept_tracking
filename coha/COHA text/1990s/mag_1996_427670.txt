Section : TECHNOLOGY/BIOTECH Scientific ingenuity put the Coulter brothers in business . A sharp business sense kept them going . <p> AT 83 , WALLACE COULTER can afford to take a relaxed view of business and retire to his scientific experiments . But he wo n't concede an inch of ground in the medical products industry . In a rare interview in a darkened corner office at the Coulter Corp . ' s Miami headquarters , we asked the founder and chairman which of the research projects excite him most . <p> " We 're spending a lot of money on cancer research , " whispers Coulter , who successfully fought off cancer three years ago . Why cancer ? " That 's where the greatest rewards are . " <p> Would those be humanitarian rewards , or is cancer just too tempting a market ? " Humanitarian , " says Wallace 's 39-year-old nephew Joseph Coulter III , nodding gravely one chair over . Uncle Wallace corrects him immediately : " Market . " <p> Add to the brief list of America 's great inventor-entrepreneurs the Coulter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who died a year ago at age 71 , Wallace Coulter turned a single engineering breakthrough-a machine to count and size microscopic particles-into one of the world 's largest medical diagnostics companies . This year the family-owned Coulter Corp . should bring in $750 million in sales from some 30,000 customers worldwide , and perhaps $50 million in profits . <p> Since the 1950s the Coulter name has been synonymous with hematology-the study of blood . Its line of cell analyzers , costing up to $120,000 , perform medicine 's most often requested diagnostic test , the complete blood count , or CBC . <p> Although its original patent expired in the early 1970s , the company has consistently kept at least half of the $1.4 billion worldwide market for automated hematology instruments , according to Boston Biomedical Consultants . The nearest competitor , Japan 's Toa Medical Electronics Corp. , has about a third . Abbott Laboratories ' diagnostics division , with $2.5 billion in sales , has inched ahead from 10% to 14% in market share over the past five years . <p> Why ? Coulter was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Johnson &; Johnson gave up the business in 1987 after a decade of trying . <p> Coulter 's empire is global , too . More than 55%of its sales are from overseas . The Coulter brothers were selling cell counters to the Russians in the late 1960s . The company 's relations with the Chinese are so tight that it 's the only foreign diagnostics company allowed to sell its own test chemicals , or reagents , for the cell counters . The competition has to cede revenue to Chinese companies . <p> Coulter 's origins read like an Indiana Jones adventure tale with a dose of science . Wallace , an engineering dropout from Georgia Tech , left for Southeast Asia in the early 1930s to sell X-ray equipment for General Electric . When the Japanese invaded China in 1937 Coulter kept a day or two ahead of them , making his way to Singapore , Australia , South Africa and South America . <p> By the end of World War II he was living in Chicago with his brother , Joe , an engineer with Motorola . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with radios and electronics . In 1947 , using a sewing needle , rubber bands and cellophane , Wallace discovered what became known as the Coulter Principle . It 's still the standard method to count tiny particles in fluids like paint , chocolate , ceramics or blood . <p> Here 's how it works . You submerge a test tube with a pinhole at one end into a bath of conductive solution , such as salt water . Then you hang a negatively charged electrode inside the tube and a positively charged electrode in the bath , to create a weak current . Next , dissolve whatever particle you need counted into the bath . Finally , apply a vacuum pump to the test tube and suck solution through the pinhole . As each particle passes through , it blocks the electrical current between the electrodes , causing voltage pulses . The size and frequency of the pulses tells you how many particles you 've got and how big they are . <p> The discovery completely changed the practice of hematology . In the old days a technician would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the nuclei in the white cells would show up ) , put it under a microscope and tally at least 100 cells with a hand clicker to estimate the red and white blood cell count . A good technician could finish one count in 30 minutes . With the first Coulter counter , the Model A introduced in 1953 , an automatic , accurate count could be had in 10 minutes . <p> Hospitals around the world started calling for Coulter counters . The brothers set up shop in 1961 in Hialeah , Fla . Joe saw to management while Wallace tinkered . Even after the original patents expired , Coulter kept its edge over would-be rivals by adding improvements to new models . It had the first machine to count multiple patient samples at once , and the first to computerize its machines to spit out easier-to-read graphs . <p> When the competition adds a new feature , Coulter copies it and then some . Two years ago Toa came out with the first automated counter for reticulocytes , or immature red blood cells . By running cells past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which tells a computer which are red cells , which are white and what type of white cells they are . Coulter went further and made the feature standard in its new model . <p> Like cameras and laser printers , blood cell counters are just the beginning of an annuity . The recurring profits are in the supplies . After discounting , selling expenses , installation and free customer training , Coulter is probably lucky to clear a 15% operating margin on the oven-size machines . ( These estimates come from outsiders ; Coulter does n't release financials . ) The manufacturer of a blood cell counter gets up to 20% from sales of reagents , saline solution and cleansers . For each $120,000 machine Coulter sells , it can gross $20,000 a year in supplies . <p> Then there 's the service revenue , which also comes with a 20% operating margin . Coulter has a 24-hour hotline for technical support and a 475-person field force available at all hours with vans filled with spare parts . Coulter charges plenty for this-up to 10% of a machine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the bulk of problems come in the first year or so , the contract revenue after that is pure profit . <p> Keeping most of the market is n't enough , however , now that the hematology market has stopped growing rapidly . That 's why Coulter has pushed into new areas of blood science ( see box ) . <p> What 's this company worth ? Maybe a billion dollars . Every few years the diagnostics industry buzzes with talk that Coulter will sell out to Roche , Johnson &; Johnson or Beckman Instruments-perhaps because it needs capital to expand or to pay estate taxes . <p> " It always comes up in strategic planning meetings , " says Joe III . " But there 's no need right now . " <p> Watch your market share and you can stay private for a long time . <p> DIAGRAM : Through a tube darkly . Rare cancer cells are tough to diagnose in a sample of whole blood . Differences between good and bad cells can be subtle and the sheer numbers overwhelm the automated counters . Coulter solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineered to find normal cells . The monoclonals grab the good cells and a magnet drags them out of the way , clarifying the picture . <p> DIAGRAM : The Coulter Principle . A 1940s discovery .

As blood cells go through the opening , they block the current , causing voltage pulses . The size and number of pulses indicate cell count and size . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Coulter Corp .

Success runs in the blood . <p> By Bruce Upbin <p> COUNTERMEASURES <p> COULTER CORP . has always been an innovator ; these days it has no choice . The bean counters who now run medicine look askance at costly cell counters . Besides , the blood-testing market has matured , with dollar volume salesgrowing at an anemic 2% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace Coulter saw this coming and diversified into cancer research . <p> Monoclonal antibodies , designed to hone in on particular cells in the body , are the specialty of Coulter Pharmaceutical in Palo Alto , Calif . The subsidiary began with a handful of monoclonals Coulter had developed with Boston 's Dana-Farber Institute , as well as $3 million in venture capital from InterWest Partners , of Menlo Park , Calif . Last year it scored a smashing success with an antibody that targets B-cells , white blood cells that become malignant in non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . The antibody , tipped with a warhead of radioactive iodine , totally eliminated tumors in half the patients and kept half of those people free of disease for up to three years . InterWest sold $22 million in private stock in May , to run the clinical trials necessary to win federal approval for the treatment . <p> To round out its remaining hoard of 200 monoclonal antibodies , parent Coulter Corp . paid an estimated $90 million in cash in 1995 to acquire Immunotech , a French biotech firm with an inventory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | AIDS screen for blood banks , is already on the market ( FORBES , Sept. 23 ) . <p> Coulter is also pursuing a technology closer to its roots : flow cytometry , which characterizes an entire population of cells . It works by squirting thousands of cells in single file past a laser beam , whose reflected and transmitted light hits an array of sensors . A computer translates the data into a graphical display that alerts a doctor to malignancies or viral activity . Fifteen years after Wallace Coulter identified the field as a growth market , his company has a $100 million business supplying it . <p> Now Coulter is combining its cytometers , monoclonals and a neat substance called metal microspheres to quickly look for " rare event " cancer cells . It 's a way to see the trees without the forest . Rare-event cells are so rare that they 're hard to pick out even if you tag them with a fluorescent antibody . So Coulter takes out the normal cells first by mixing the sample with nickel microspheres coated with normal-finding monoclonals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink , leaving the bad cells ready for the flow cytometer . <p>
