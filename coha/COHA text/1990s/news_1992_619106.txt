<p> Fedora rakishly tilted and raincoat tightly cinched despite nerd heat rising from the huge crush attending the Mac World convention at Moscone Center , Robert X. Cringely hides behind dark glasses as he receives fans and critics of his work . <p> Cringely is the gossip columnist for InfoWorld , a national weekly computer industry newspaper published in San Mateo . Most of what it publishes is as dry and technical as something on how to attach your modem . <p> His " Notes From the Field " is where 500,000 readers turn weekly for zippy insider dope about flawed products and dirt on industry titans such as William Gates , head of Microsoft Corp . and America 's wealthiest man . <p> Gates , according to one Cringely item , is so cheap he held up a long line in a Seattle convenience store not long ago patting his pockets for a 50-cents-off coupon for butter pecan ice cream . The search went on so long that the clerk finally tossed a couple quarters on the counter to get Gates ( estimated worth : $ 6.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when you earn your first million , " the 7-Eleven clerk told Gates as he pocketed the coins . <p> " I heard that story from the man who was behind him in line , " said Cringely . <p> The wonderfully Dickensian " Cringely " is n't his real name but a nom de plume used on 235 columns he has written over four years exposing clay feet and dubious dealings in Silicon Valley . " I 'm the third Bob Cringely . " <p> Some of Cringely 's exposes appear in his breezy " Accidental Empires " ( Addison-Wesley , $ 19.95 ) . As the title suggests , Cringely argues that many of the big successes in Silicon Valley came as much by happenstance as design . Kids who liked to fool around with computers were in the right place at the right time . A vast industry was created on the fly , huge fortunes made . <p> " There was no urge to see the world , to win a war , to cure disease , or even to get rich that explains how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs today . Instead , the game was started to satisfy the disenfranchised nerds like Bill Gates who did n't meet the macho standards of American maleness and so looked for a way to create their own adolescent alternative to the adult world and , through that creation , gain the admiration of their peers . " <p> Cringely , 39 , was raised in Ohio and went to the same obscure liberal arts college Watergate snitch John Dean did . " Our only famous graduate . " He worked for the local newspaper as an undergraduate and assumed he 'd stay when he got his sheepskin . <p> " The day after I graduated the editor introduced me to my replacement . He assumed I 'd leave , I assumed I 'd stay . " <p> " OK , " he decided , " I 'll become a war correspondent . " A bunch of newspapers agreed to print his dispatches for $ 25 each , and he chased off to Northern Ireland and Lebanon in the late ' 70s looking for action . <p> " The bombs would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be running toward it . " After a while , this got to be pretty old . " In an amazingly rational moment I chose to seek another life . " <p> He went to Stanford , got his feet wet in computer science hanging around the artificial intelligence lab while getting a doctorate in communications , taught awhile , then went to work for InfoWorld . He can program in four computer languages , none well enough to get a good job doing it , and has made hardware devices that nearly worked . <p> " I 'm a failure , of course . It takes a failure  --  someone who is not quite clever enough to succeed or to be considered a threat  --  to gain access to the heart of any competitive , ego-driven industry . This is a business that wo n't brook rivals but absolutely demands an audience . " <p> Tips for his column arrive via telephone , E-mail and the post . Many come from whistle-blowing engineers , pained by employers trying to fob shoddy goods off on the consumer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business that I perform a consumer affairs function by keeping people honest . " <p> One major company 's program , said Cringley , was flawed by 600 bugs but was shipped to market anyhow . <p> " But the record is one by another company that had 3,000 bugs , " said Cringely . <p> A HUMOROUS STYLE <p> " I like his column for the humor , " said consultant Peter LaFourrette , 57 , who stopped by the booth at Moscone Center to pick up an autographed book from Cringely . " He gets into what 's going underneath , " said Jason Stelzel , 27 , owner of an audio-visual company . <p> Although he admires Gates for his business acumen , his book has a number of anecdotes about " the boy billionaire " ( he 's three years younger than Cringely ) that make him seem part mama 's boy , part martinet . <p> " When Chairman Bill appears in public with unwashed hair and unkempt clothing , his keepers in Microsoft corporate PR know that they , not Bill , will soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , according to Cringely , Gates refused to hire anyone whose first name was also William . <p> BREAKING THE NEWS <p> Gates is not the only one to get the back of Cringely 's hand . His account of Apple Computer boss Steve Jobs is hair-curling . <p> " With total power , the willful kid who 'd always resented the fact that he had been adopted created at Apple a metafamily in which he played the domineering , disrespectful , demanding type of father that he imagined must have abandoned him those many years ago . " <p> When Apple shut down its Lisa division , Jobs made the announcement to 300 stunned employees . <p> " I see only B and C players here , " he said . " All the A players work for me in the Macintosh division . I might be interested in hiring two or three of you . Do n't you wish you knew which ones I 'll choose ? " <p> Cringely said , " Jobs was so full of himself that he began to believe his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been invented to help sell computers . At one point a marketer named Dan'l Lewin stood up to him , saying , ' Steve , we wrote this stuff about you . We made it up . ' " <p> William Shockley , who won the Nobel Prize for inventing the semiconductor , " was a good scientist but a bad manager . He posted a list of salaries on the bulletin board , ticking off those who were being paid less for the same work . When the work was n't going well , he blamed sabotage and demanded lie-detector tests . " <p> One of those who split from Shockley 's company was fellow genius Robert Noyce , who went on to help create the giant Fairchild Semiconductor , which itself spun off more than 50 new start-up semiconductor companies , many patterned after his relaxed , anti- hierarchy manner of management . After 30 years of work , which included founding Intel , Noyce still occupied no more than a modest cubicle with shoulder- high partitions . <p> " There was the time he stood in a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cashier 's check for $ 1.3 million from his personal savings , confiding gleefully that he was going to buy a Learjet that afternoon . " <p> The breakaway of Noyce and seven others from Shockley 's firm set a pattern . <p> " At the heart of every start-up is an argument , " Cringely said . " A splinter group inside a successful company wants to abandon the current product line and bet the company on some radical new technology . The boss , usually the guy who invented the current technology , thinks the idea is crazy and says so , wishing the splinter group well on their new adventure . " <p> Cringely has 2,000 copies of his engaging book to give away . To get one , dish him some dirt or slip him an industry secret .
