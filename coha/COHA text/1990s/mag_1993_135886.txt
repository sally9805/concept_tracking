College Basketball 's best intersectional rivalry , the UCLA-Notre Dame of its day , is now Duke versus Michigan . The Blue Devils and the Wolverines have hooked up to provide some wonderful early December diversions over the last few seasons , something to lure us home from Christmas shopping at the mall . To be sure , last Saturday 's meeting in Ann Arbor was raggedy and not nearly as dramatic as the Fab Five 's coming-out party against Duke , an overtime loss at Crisler Arena in 1991 . Nor was it as intense as the Blue Devils ' silencing of the No. 1-ranked Wolverines in Durham a year ago . ( The run-up to that game included all sorts of incendiary jabbering , talk conspicuously absent from this year 's game . ) But Duke 's 73-63 victory , on the eve of a break for exams on both campuses , proved nonetheless to contain some revealing lessons . // It showed that the Blue Devils have a fully mature center in Cherokee Parks , and that the Wolverines , with Chris Webber gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the redoubtable Juwan Howard . More than anything , though , the game made clear that wherever these two teams are going in the months ahead , Grant Hill and Jalen Rose will take them there . Rose , a junior , scored 31 points for the Wolverines in his usual nonchalant style while playing all 40 minutes of the game . Hill , a senior , gave a foretaste of how he intends to fill the role he inherited from Bobby Hurley , the former Blue Devil point guard ( page 26 ) . Hill scored 18 points on the day and made all three of his three-point attempts . // Rose and Hill are totems that , unfairly or not , have come to stand for their respective programs . The superficial analysis pegs Rose as the truant and Hill as the standard-bearer . But , in fact , they share many similarities . Each is 6 ' 8 " . Each has a splendid array of skills adaptable to any position on the floor . Each has a strong-willed mother , and each has an All-America dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBA star Jimmy Walker ; in Hill 's , the onetime Yale running back Calvin Hill , who later was a Pro Bowler in the NFL. // But Rose , unlike Hill , did n't spend the off-season appearing with his school 's president on PBS 's Charlie Rose Show , or quoting Max Lerner and Aristotle in an address to the National Association of Basketball Coaches ' Issues Forum , or being quoted himself in The New York Times on serving as a role model for black youth . The social theorists might say this is because Grant 's father never misses his son 's games , and Jalen has seen his dad only on film . The social theorists might well be right . // Detroit Free Press columnist Mitch Albom tracked down Walker in Atlanta last spring and writes of their encounter in his new book , Fab Five . Walker told Albom that he followed his son from afar . He said that if he had it to do over , he would have stayed in touch  --  but in the next breath he denied having any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the early 1970s . Yet he asked Albom to pass his phone number along . " Tell Jalen to call me , if he wants , " Walker said . // Walker 's son wears his pedigree as he does his shorts  --  long , full , flapping in the breeze . His origins are always there : in the gangsta rap blaring from his boom box , in his half-put-on self-centeredness ( asked at last spring 's Final Four whether he feared anything , Rose said , " Death , ' cause I ca n't imagine the world without me in it " ) , in the black patch he wore on his jersey last Saturday in memory of Johnny Moore , a cousin who was gunned down in Detroit last week . In his book Albom describes Rose behaving like a petulant pain in the ass during Michigan 's European tour two summers ago . Said Rose at one point , " I 'm a product of my environment , and this ai n't it . " // Walker was the Jalen Rose of his time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination to be different , the same loping insouciance on the court . After college those traits took a more serious turn , and he became a shirker and a scapegrace , tailed by the IRS and various women who claimed he had fathered their children . In the NBA , Walker missed planes and practices and was regularly fined for his transgressions . Just as Rose was ticketed by the police last year for loitering at a house where drugs were being used ( though he was never charged with a crime in the incident ) and ignored the pleas of his mother and brother that he forsake the friendships that had placed him there , his dad kept up with someone he had known as a kid in Roxbury , Mass. , even after the guy got sent up for killing a store clerk . These are my friends , father said then , son says now . So maybe it 's true that the apple never falls far from the tree , even when the tree pulls up roots . // " I ca n't get him no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker 's invitation to call . He declined even to take his father 's number . Then , impulsively , on the day of last spring 's NCAA tournament final against North Carolina , Rose asked Albom for the number . Several times he picked up the phone and started to dial . Each time he put the receiver back down . When Jeanne found out later that her son had considered calling the man who ran out on them two decades ago , she was furious . " If he wants to see you , let him come up here , " she told him . As of last week father and son still had not spoken . // Without a father , Rose had to improvise a support system . Webber was one crucial part of it . The two developed a fascinating symbiosis : Chris , who attended a fancy-pants private high school at his parents ' insistence , helped take the edge off Jalen 's goofiness ; Jalen , a neighborhood friend since grade school , kept Chris 's street credentials in order . Rose enjoyed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had coached him at Detroit 's Southwestern High before coming to Ann Arbor as a Michigan assistant coach . Watson played the role Walker abandoned , while recruiting Rose helped Watson land the Michigan job . // In both of these relationships , however , Rose 's need was a little more desperate . This season , with Webber gone to the Golden State Warriors and Watson off to the University of Detroit Mercy as its new head coach , Rose 's ability to adapt will determine whether the Wolverines fulfill the predictions that they 'll win the Big Ten , something they failed to do in two tries with Webber . " Their leaving has made me stronger , " says Rose of Webber 's and Watson 's departure . " I realize everything 's on me , as far as what kind of player , person and student I 'm going to be . " // He has improved on all counts . Freed of point guard responsibilities , Rose is getting clear paths for dribble drives to the basket and sallies to the offensive boards . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son-of-a-coach point guard from the Silverdome suburbs , makes Michigan seem a little like Parliament-Funkadelic with Jim Nabors singing lead . ) Rose 's academic performance has been " significantly more responsible , " says Wolverine coach Steve Fisher . And after two years of wearing his practice jersey backward , Rose now wears it the same old dull way everybody else does . Did Fisher order him to do so ? " I may have , " he says . " But I did n't have to . " // Michigan 's more businesslike manner concerns Fisher , who suspects that his team may need some of the dodgy trappings of the past two seasons , whether they be words , gestures or both . " At times they needed to be emotional , especially as freshmen , " says Fisher . " It helped them be better than they were . I 've told them this season that I 'm worried sometimes that they show no emotion . It 's like they 're just going to work . It 's that fine line : You do n't want them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // The Wolverines ' best moments against Duke occurred in the final five minutes , when they trapped and pressed furiously and nearly retrieved the game . But with only nine players on scholarship , and no frontcourt size , Fisher can only order up such frenzy in rationed doses . What 's more , the Fab Five without Webber is like a choir short one of its leading voices . " Chris had so much personality , " said Duke 's Marty Clark afterward . " The way I saw it , they lacked a little expressiveness today . At their best they 're talking and they 're cocky , hitting shots and playing D. It just was n't there for 40 minutes . " // Blue Devil coach Mike Krzyzewski 's challenge with Hill is just the opposite of the one Fisher had when Rose was an underclassman . The task is n't to tone Hill down but to bring him out . " I do n't want to look back at this year and regret that I did n't do this or that , " says Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . Maybe smile , maybe frown . Be more emotional , more vocal , instead of keeping that stone face whether we 're winning by 20 or down by 20 . " In other words , while Rose makes more like Hill , Hill wants a little more Rose in his game . // " Grant can play every position , " says Krzyzewski . " And has . And will . " // However , there 's no more effective place for him than at the top of the key , with the ball and an unobstructed view of the floor . In Hill , Duke has the best player in the country to take advantage of this season 's two most significant rule changes : the shorter , 35-second shot clock and the abolition of the five-second call when a dribbler is closely guarded . " Those rules will hurt most teams , " says Hill . " But often they 'll help us . I can mess with the ball outside and then still get a decent shot . " And if the defense springs a trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the open man . // With four freshmen Krzyzewski has had so many questions about his team 's chemistry that , in search of answers , he started four different lineups in Duke 's first four games . The most emphatic response has come from Parks , the 6 ' 11 " junior from Huntington Beach , Calif . To hail from a Southern California beach town is one thing , to be a surfer and the son of flower children is likely to make you laid-back twice over . " Cherokee wants to play the safe role , " says Clark , his roommate . " He wants to be safe . " // What an astonishment , then , to see Parks in the game 's opening moments take two quick outside shots coming off screens , as if he were that nimble Dookie of yore , Jack Marin . He buried the first ; the second was the only shot he missed all afternoon . Largely as a result of Parks 's 23 points and nine rebounds , the Wolverines ' class of ' 95 still has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national title game . // As for Hill and Rose , they talked during the game , but it was all sweet talk . " It was n't , ' I 'm gon na do you in , ' " Hill says . " It was more , if I had a nice move , he 'd tell me so . If he had one , I 'd tell him . " // Who would have thought ? Duke versus Michigan , a vicarage tea party . These two 6 ' 8 " convertibles , one taut-limbed , the other loose , are , if not the game 's yin and yang , its thing and thang . Nice that they got along so well on Saturday .
