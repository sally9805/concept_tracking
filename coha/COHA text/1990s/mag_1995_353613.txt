A DETROIT COMPUTER BULLETIN board lists the names of local agents of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms and offers helpful advice on how to harass them . A licensed gun dealer , required to surrender his business records to ATF 's national tracing center , coated them first with rat excrement . A flyer found posted in Pennsylvania reads WANTED : ATF AGENT . DEAD . <P> The ATF may be the most hated federal agency in America today , surpassing even the IRS in its notoriety . Gun-rights advocates have demonized the agency as a dark legion of storm troopers who trample the rights of ordinary citizens . Critics have gone so far as to compare its treatment of gun owners to Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II . In a best-selling book published last year , Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association described ATF 's disastrous raid at Waco , which began the 51-day siege that ended in conflagration , as " reminiscent of the standoff at the Warsaw ghetto . " Opposition to ATF has become so intense in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nunziato , who heads the ATF tracing center . He distills its creed : " The gun is God ; the N.R.A . is the congregation ; and ATF is the devil . " <P> The bureau is not the jackbooted monolith of N.R.A . lore , however . Far from it : court documents and internal reports uncovered in a two-month TIME investigation reveal ATF as a divided and troubled agency far more likely to abuse the rights of its own employees than those of law-abiding citizens . If anything , its internal troubles have impaired its law-enforcement abilities by embroiling agents and managers in a web of in-house scandals and divisive controversies . The agency faces a class action by black agents who claim widespread discrimination and intimidation , including the posting at one office of a " State of Oklahoma Nigger Hunting License . " Last week charges resurfaced that ATF agents attended a racist gathering in Tennessee , the annual " Good O ' Boys Roundup . " Agents complain too of a management culture that doles harsh discipline to agents but goes to great lengths to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of its Dallas office who sexually harassed an employee received a demotion and transfer  --  to the Virgin Islands . " Any agent who 's honest with you will tell you this agency has to be gutted , " says Diane Klipfel , a supervisory agent in ATF 's Chicago division who is mired in a battle with the bureau that began when she accused her commanders of corruption . <P> Two decades of outside scrutiny and persistent threats to its survival have so cowed the bureau that it now shies from certain categories of investigations , including probes of licensed gun dealers . Instead the ATF focuses more on such politically safe targets as crack gangs , outlaw bikers and ordinary killers . One indicator : the number of firearms ATF has taken into custody dropped 27% , to 12,965 , from 1992 to 1994 . Of those guns , 6,261 were handguns , or about three for each of the bureau 's 2,000 agents . An ATF spokesman says such fluctuations are meaningless , but Kay Kubicki , a former ATF agent who is now counsel for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only reason the total of guns seized would go down is morale , " she says . " There 's a direct correlation between the turmoil in the agency and the decline . "
