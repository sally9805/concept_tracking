<p> After giving one of his relationship seminars , John Gray , author of " Men Are From Mars , Women Are From Venus , " was in his hotel room getting ready for bed when there was a knock at the door . He opened it to a woman he recognized . <p> " I had noticed her many times during my presentation and found her very attractive . There was strong physical chemistry . " <p> She walked through the door and , looking him straight in the eyes , unzipped her skirt and let it fall to the floor . <p> " I want you , " she whispered . <p> Recalled Gray : " My body rejoiced , but my mind began to panic : After all , I was happily married , and I dearly loved my wife . " <p> The flustered Gray explained his married status as the woman began to unbutton his shirt . <p> " It 's OK , I 'll never tell , " she answered . <p> He dithered some more . " But do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If she was willing to overlook it , why could n't he ? " Why could n't I be a loving husband at home and also have a little extra pleasure on the side ? " Gray asked himself . <p> But after further struggle with his conscience , Gray reluctantly decided to remain faithful to his wife , Bonnie . When he came home to Mill Valley , he did something some would consider odd . He explained to her his disappointment about his decision and asked if she would mind if he gave in to carnal urges in the future when the occasion arose . <p> IF IT FEELS GOOD . . . <p> " I reasoned that as long as the affairs were brief and recreational , then possibly there would be no negative emotional repercussions . " How , he asked himself , could something be bad if it felt so good ? <p> Bonnie set him straight on that score . Weeping , she explained that she would begin to close to him emotionally if she thought he was having extramarital affairs behind her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share her feelings with me in such a magnificent way , " Gray wrote . " I was able to listen without becoming defensive ; there was no criticism , blame , or judgment in her words ; I felt no need to justify myself . " <p> His heart , Gray recalled , " filled with an even deeper , more committed love for my wife . " <p> This account begins Gray 's new book , " What Your Mother Could n't Tell You &; Your Father Did n't Know " ( HarperCollins , $ 23 ) . Like his earlier mega-hit , which has sold more than 2 million copies in 18 months and still tops the best-seller lists , it tries to explain ways men and women can better understand each other . <p> " Men Are From Mars , Women Are From Venus " sold more copies last month than any other since it came out in May 1992 , which suggests that the market for interpreting the sexes to each other might be limitless . But not the material . Gray 's new book goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . Yet it begins with 650,000 copies in print . <p> Deborah Tannen , a linguistics professor at Georgetown University , had her version of the subject , " You Just Do n't Understand , " on the best-seller list for four years . <p> A PIVOTAL POINT <p> A visitor last week to Gray 's Mill Valley home , a two-story shingled affair under the redwoods that is modest by neighborhood standards ( they 've bought a new one up the street with a view of Mount Tam ) , suggested that the incident that opens his new book seemed to betray a misunderstanding of women , strange in light of his background as a psychologist . <p> " The reason I put it in there was it was a pivotal point in our marriage . As far as psychology and monogamy go , some of the most famous psychologists were polygamous , and many therapists have justified having affairs . I certainly do n't and even then did n't , but I was challenged . " <p> ' Why could n't I be a loving husband at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Gray asked himself <p> Gray called his perky wife in to explain her thinking . She was supportive . <p> " My husband is an experimenter . He does n't just decide that things are the way they are . He has to find out the reasons why . When he deeply understands something , then he can teach . He was totally open at that moment to really understanding what my thinking was , and it gave me an opportunity to dig deeply within myself . " <p> She laughed . " Nobody ever proposed that to me before . They either did it or they did n't . " <p> Gray is 42 but looks young enough to get carded if he went to bars , which is doubtful . He came to the door in bare feet , with a small dog yapping the alarm . He is a native of Texas ( his mother was an astrologer and his father , a wealthy oilman ) who left high school to study Transcendental Meditation with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi , guru to the Beatles when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's youngest teacher and for years was the maharishi 's personal assistant , traveling the world as his representative . <p> " It was a nine-year involvement in my life . " Although he still venerates him , Gray said he no longer has any contact with the maharishi . He earned a doctorate in counseling by taking a correspondence course in 1982 from Columbia Pacific University , an unaccredited institution in a former mortuary in San Rafael . <p> Gray 's original counseling was with classes of 15 to 20 people who came to learn what he called " En lightened Sexuality , " or the spiritual side of sex . His first big success came when he began teaching with , dating and eventually marrying Barbara De Angelis , author of the best-selling " Secrets About Men Every Woman Should Know . " By the time they got married , two years after they first became involved , they were teaching seminars of 75 to 100 people . <p> PROFESSIONAL DISASTER <p> When the marriage broke up in 1984 , it was a professional disaster . Gray tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had happened at the beginning and offering refunds to those who thought he did n't have anything to teach them . <p> " I could n't figure out what went wrong . I did everything I knew to make a marriage work . I re-evaluated everything I knew and questioned everything . " <p> A psychologist friend in Los Angeles told him he was a good teacher about relationships but still did n't understand that there were big differences between the genders . <p> " My first reaction was a tremendous amount of resistance . I felt he was being sexist . " But the more he looked into it , the more Gray saw that men and women behave and communicate in different ways . <p> Brain research , according to Gray , has shown that the genders are wired differently . This accounts for a large part of the misunderstandings . <p> " A man 's brain first develops billions of neuroconnectors between his emotions and his action center . When he is emotionally charged or upset , he generally wants to do something about it . Finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his feelings only later and with reluctance . Women find these silences frustrating , interpreting them as withdrawal instead of the male way . <p> WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT <p> In contrast , " a woman has billions of neuroconnectors between her feelings and the talking center . In a sense , she has superhighways connecting her feeling to speech . " Before she tackles a problem , she likes to talk it through . <p> That 's one problem . Another is the changed role of both . Man , for millennia the hunter who risked his life to feed his family , basked in the approval of his successful forays when he got back . Staring in the fire was his way of relaxing from the tension of the hunt . Nowadays it 's the television screen he stares at to recover . <p> CONSENSUAL NATURE <p> But women are in the workplace themselves now . There they have to repress their consensual and nurturing nature in favor of the masculine , results-oriented approach that is dominant , said Gray . They come home and want to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally natural silence of their mates as indifference . Their attempts to open up the men is often interpreted as nagging and evokes hostility . <p> " Women today no longer primarily need men to provide on a physical level . They want men to provide on an emotional level as well . Men today also want more than homemakers and mothers for their children . They want women to nurture their emotional needs but not mother them or treat them like children . " <p> In his small study with its two statues of Buddha , Gray is well along on his next book . It 's about communicating in the bedroom . Chapter 7 begins , " Women need more sex than ever before . "
