Not long after the purchase of my telescope , I thought about how great it would be to have my own observatory . During the next six years , I made a list of the problems I encountered when observing in order to determine what would be best for my observatory design . Several years of cold feet , numbing winter wind , dropped set screws , kicked tripods , broken cables , and dead car batteries taught me what I really wanted . To get a better idea about how to solve my problems , I looked through ASTRONOMY magazine and read How to Build Your Own Observatory ( which contains reprints from Telescope Making magazine ) . I wanted an efficient , easily manageable , and comfortable structure that would fulfill all of my needs . No single observatory described in these magazine articles seemed just right for me , but I did pick up some ideas . Still , I had to choose between a roll-off roof and a dome and between a concrete and a wooden floor . And where to build my observatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the lights ? What about my abilities as a builder ? I am not a professional carpenter , just an average do-it-yourselfer . My observatory would have to be built with powered hand tools , including a saw , a small miter saw , a scroll saw , a couple of drills , and a borrowed router . This article will show you how I solved these problems and built the foundation for my observatory . Two later articles describe how I built the floor , walls , and roof . The observatory cost only $1,500 and was a wonderful project . ( Note : Before you build a observatory , check with your local building inspector to determine whether you need a permit and what building restrictions may apply to your structure . ) DESIGNING OWL OBSERVATORY I live in Great Falls , Montana , which is located in the central part of the state and has a population of about 50,000 . Light pollution in town is unacceptable , and too much of the sky is obstructed by trees and buildings in my backyard . So I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a clear horizon . For the past few years I have packed my scope in my truck and driven to an abandoned farm about 25 miles east of Great Falls near the small community of Highwood . This old homestead has a weathered windmill and a small reservoir and is surrounded by fields of wheat and barley . This site is not only ideal or observing and astrophotography , but abundant wildlife and the nearby scenic Highwood Mountains make my outings an enjoyable and relaxing experience . The property is owned by Earl Davison , who is a farmer , rancher , and friend . Earl agreed to meet me at the site and discuss my plans for an observatory . A few hours later my dream began to become a reality when Earl agreed to lease some land and I could start to build my observatory . Although I am not an architect by any stretch o the imagination , I think my plan is a good one . As an astrophotographer , I want clear access to the entire sky . I felt the view of the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a roll-off roof , which would also save on cost . For greater access to the horizon , the top two feet of the east , south , and west walls fold down . The entrance is in the north wall and the roof rolls off to the north , so there is no point in having this wall fold down . The telescope is mounted on a steel pipe set in concrete . And the wood floor is raised , which helps to keep my feet warm in the winter . The building is 10 ' square , providing ample room for the telescope , with room left over for a table to hold charts and extra equipment . The rails for the roll-off roof make the overall structure 10 x 20 feet . The work progressed in three phases . Phase one was the construction of the pier and building foundations . This was done during the summer and fall of 1990 . Phase two included building the floor and walls . This work was started during the winter in my garage and finished at the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage was building the roof . This enclosed the observatory before the winter of 1991 struck . PHASE ONE THE PIER It is easier to cast the pier first and then cast the building footings . This order of events ensures that the building will be centered on the pier . My pier consists of an 8 " steel pipe set in a pyramid-shaped concrete footing . The pyramid shape gives the footing a low center of gravity , which should help prevent shifting in the ground . In any case , a pier means digging a hole in the ground . Dig a hole much larger than you need for the footing so you 'll have room to install and remove the forms used for pouring the concrete . My footing measures 40 " square at the bottom , 20 " square at the top , and 3 " high . My son Josh and I dug a hole 5 ' square and 4 ' deep . It took us over four hours to dig the hole by hand . For the sides of the form , I cut four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see the illustration above ) . ( Illustration omitted ) . I then reinforced the plywood with 2x4s along the top , bottom , and each side . Everything was fastened with screws . Building forms to hold about a yard of concrete is one place where you want to make everything as strong as possible . New pipe is expensive , but you can go to a junk yard or scrap metal dealer and buy used pipe . I was lucky to be given an 8 ' length of used pipe . I bought a scrap piece of quarter-inch plate steel and welded it to the pipe for use as an accessory shelf . Several 1-1/4-inch holes drilled in the plate will hold eyepieces during my observing sessions . Not everyone has welding equipment or the tools necessary to drill holes in plate steel , but you can go to a local machine shop to have this work done for you . Toward the top of the pier , I drilled a hole for conduit to run into an attached electrical outlet box and a second hole where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , I did n't know when I would get electrical power installed at the observatory site , but holes could n't be drilled in the pier once it was installed . In the meantime , I could use the conduit with a DC battery and never again worry about tripping over power cords . Before setting the pipe into the ground , I coated the lower four feet of the pipe  --  the part to be underground  --  with a quick-drying tar and then wrapped it with vinyl tape . ( This technique is used in gas construction to prevent corrosion of steel gas lines . ) Now to set my pier and forms . The pier should extend through the bottom of the footing to allow any condensation that forms to drain away and , thus , prevent rust and corrosion . I did this by digging a 6 " deep , 18 " square hole in the bottom of the pier hole . I put two bricks in the center of this small hole and placed my pier on top of them . The pier was supported across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn were screwed to stakes that were driven in the ground ( photo above ) . ( Photo omitted ) . I could plumb the pier easily by moving the end that was resting on the bricks . Once the pier was plumb , the small hole was filled with gravel . The gravel helps to keep the pier in place while pouring the concrete and insures that the pier will extend out the bottom of the footing afterward . The forms were installed one at a time around the pier and screwed together . After centering the forms around the pier and leveling them , I drove stakes into the ground around the bottom of the forms and screwed them to the forms . Use at least three stakes on each side , because concrete has a tendency to lift the forms and push out through the bottom . When pouring concrete , do n't forget to put in reinforcing bar . Also called rebar , it strengthens the footing and holds it together if it develops cracks . Since it 's nearly impossible to pour such a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good idea to install rebar . I needed a little under one yard of concrete to pour the footing for my pier . Locally , delivered concrete costs $65 a yard . But there was one string attached . Since the job site was outside the city limits , a $95 delivery charge would be added to the cost of the concrete . I decided instead to mix and pour my own concrete . ( In some areas , you can borrow or rent a small trailer to haul ready-mix concrete instead of having it delivered by truck . ) One evening I hauled about a cubic yard of mixed sand and gravel in a rented trailer . The following evening Josh and I took a rented gas-powered cement mixer , five bags of cement , and thirty gallons of water out to the site . We mixed the concrete following a one part cement to three parts sand and gravel recipe . The normal mixture is one to five , but I wanted a stronger-than-normal pier footing . About a week later I removed the forms . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I had enough material to complete the footings for the building . I filled in the remainder of the hole with the dirt from the excavation , shoveling in only about six inches at a time . To eliminate later settling of the pier , I thoroughly tamped each layer . I raked the leftover dirt level to prepare for construction of the building footings . THE FOUNDATION While designing my observatory , a major concern was the longevity of the structure . I wanted one that would last my lifetime . I did not want the structure lying on the ground because the wood had rotted . So my observatory has a raised floor . Also , mice are plentiful in this neck of the woods . I do n't want to walk into my observatory some night and have it smell like a barn or a grainbin . Few mice will nest under the raised floor . Any that do probably will be cleaned out by varmints  --  I hope I do n't show up some night with a skunk under my feet ! To support the raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I set metal post brackets into concrete footings . Eight footings were needed for my 10-foot square building and four more for the rail posts ( see the illustration above ) . ( Illustration omitted ) . I considered using preformed concrete footings available from hardware stores , but they are expensive . Besides I already had all of the supplies necessary for casting my own , left over from making the pier . Laying out the foundation is one of the most important parts of this whole project . If the foundation is not level and square , you 're in for a big headache because it will be hard to build the walls , and the roll-off roof may not work properly . Take your time to get your foundation laid out right . Laying out a foundation requires only a compass , strings , levels , two tape measures , wooden stakes , and a little high school math . ( You can use a transit if you know how to use one or have a friend who does . ) First , I ran a 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the pier 's steel pipe . Five feet on each side from where this string touches the pier , I ran 25 ' strings in the north-south direction . The strings should extend roughly 7 ' south of the east-west string . Stakes made from 2x4s driven into the ground near the ends of the strings held them taut . ( A nail pounded into the top of the stake will make it easier to adjust the strings . ) Next , I marked the corners of the foundation . I started by laying out the northwest and southwest corners , driving a stake to mark the location of each corner . The southwest corner is 5 ' south of the east-west string and the northwest corner is 15 ' north of the string . ( To center the pier exactly in your building , subtract the radius of your pipe from the southwest corner distance and add it to the northwest corner distance . ) I double-checked that the stakes were exactly 20 ' from nail to nail and then removed all the strings used to this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has to be perpendicular to the west side of the building defined by the two newly installed corner stakes . You could use a compass to lay out this stake , but that is n't very accurate . Instead I used the diagonal measurement of the building . The diagonal may be found from the Pythagorean theorem  --  the square of the diagonal is equal to the sum of the squares of the north and west sides . For my building the diagonal is 22 ' ' - 4- 5/16 " ( the square root of 500 , or 20x20 + 10x10 ) . From the northwest stake , I measured 10 ' to the east . Using a second tape , I simultaneously measured from the southwest stake 22 ' ' - 4- 5/16 " to the northeast . I drove a stake and nail  --  to mark where these two measurements intersected . The southeast corner was marked in the same way , 10 ' to the east of the southwest stake and 22 ' ' - 4- 5/16 " to the southeast from the northwest stake . Double-check these two diagonal measurements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once the four stakes were set and square , I placed the batterboards that will actually hold the strings used to lay out the footings . The corner stakes must be removed to excavate the holes or the footings . Yet once the holes are dug , we still need the strings to help us set the post brackets accurately in the footings . Place batterboards outside the planned foundation ; they are ideal for holding the strings . To make a batterboard , screw a short piece of wood to the top of two stakes . You 'll need to make eight of these , two for each corner . I drove one batterboard into the ground about two feet from the corner stake on each of the outside directions . For example , for the southwest stake , I placed one batterboard two feet south of the corner stake and a second batterboard two feet to the west of the stake ( see photo on the opposite page ) . ( Photo omitted ) . Once you 've driven all of the batterboards into the ground , run four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch the nails on the corner stakes . Pound nails into the wood strip of the batterboard to hold the string in place . You 'll need two more sets of batterboards . One divides the foundation into two 10 by 10 foot squares . Place this set of batterboards so their centers are about 10 ' from the northern string . The position of the dividing line is best measured using diagonals . The southern square has the pier obstructing its center so it is easier to measure from the northern corners . I measured 14 ' ' - 1- 11/16 " from these corners to the side strings and marked these intersections with a string running between the batterboards . Place the last set of batterboards with their centers about 5 ' from the northern string . These boards mark the location of the second pair of posts for the roll-off roof rails . I used diagonals from the northern corners of length 11 ' ' - 2- 3/16 " to mark the position of this string . As the final step of the layout , I marked the midpoints in each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on a side , I tied a short piece of string onto each string 5 ' from each corner . The intersections of the strings and knots in the southern square should mark the positions for 12 footings . Finally , I double-checked all the string measurements and leveled the strings . For each footing , I dug a hole 10-1/2 " square and 10 " deep . The hole was centered at each point marked by the strings . After digging the hole , I tamped the bottom so the footing wo n't settle later . The top of the form was made from 2x4s . I drove stakes into the ground around the form and screwed them to the 2x4s . I placed in each hole stirrup-shaped post supports available from the hardware store . The supports have 12 " sections of 3/4-inch pipe welded to the bottom . This was n't long enough so I inserted some 1/2 " pipe to get a total length of 18 " . The extra length of pipe enabled me to drive the pipe into the ground to hold it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support was first centered under its string marker and leveled . Then I drove the supports into the ground until they were a uniform distance below the string . The distance from the string will depend on the height of your batterboards , but I set the bottom or my post brackets 4 " above the ground . When all the forms and post brackets were in place , I rechecked the brackets to see that they were level and at the same height . I mixed the concrete by hand in a wheelbarrow and poured the pads . Between wheelbarrow loads , I edged and finished previously poured footings . It took a good day 's work to lay out the foundation , dig the holes , and pour the concrete . A few days later I removed the forms , cleaned up the area , and raked and leveled the dirt left over from the excavations . At this point , phase one was finished . With winter coming on , work stopped at the observatory site . During the long winter months , I prefabricated the observatory walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you how I built the floor and walls . Part two of Jim Krick 's " Building Owl Observatory " will appear in the May issue and part three in the June issue . <p>                     @x As Turkey 's ruling Justice and Development Party ( Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi , AKP ) begins its seventh year in leadership , Turkey is no longer the secular and democratic country that it was when the party took over . The AKP has conquered the bureaucracy and changed Turkey 's fundamental identity . Prior to the AKP 's rise , Ankara oriented itself toward the United States and Europe . Today , despite the rhetoric of European Union accession , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has turned Turkey away from Europe and toward Russia and Iran and reoriented Turkish policy in the Middle East away from sympathy toward Israel and much more toward friendship with Hamas , Hezbollah , and Syria . Anti-American , anti-Christian , and anti-Semitic sentiments have increased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AKP political machine but also a shadowy Islamist sect led by the mysterious hocaefendi ( master lord ) Fethullah Glen ; the sect often bills itself as a proponent of tolerance and dialogue but works toward purposes quite the opposite . Today , Glen and his backers ( Fethullahc ? lar , Fethullahists ) not only seek to influence government but also to become the government . <p> Today , Turkey has over 85,000 active mosques , one for every 350 citizens -- compared to one hospital for every 60,000 citizens -- the highest number per capita in the world , and , with 90,000 imams , more imams than doctors or teachers . It has thousands of madrasa-like Imam-Hatip schools and about four thousand more official slate-run Qur'an courses , not counting the unofficial Qur'an schools , which may expand the total number tenfold . Spending by the governmental Directorate of Religious Affairs ( Diyanet Isleri Baskanligi ) has grown five fold , from 553 trillion Turkish lira in 2002 ( approximately US$325 million ) to 2.7 quadrillion lira during the first four-and-a-half years of the AKP government ; it has a larger budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate in Turkey 's mosques exceeds that of Iran 's , and religion classes teaching Sunni Islam are compulsory in public schools despite rulings against the practice by the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) and the Turkish high court ( Danistay ) . n2 Both Prime Minister Erdogan and the Diyanet head Ali Bardakoglu criticized the rulings for failing to consult Islamic scholars . <p> Glen now helps set the political agenda in Turkey using his followers in the AKP as well as the movement 's vast media empire , financial institutions and banks , business organizations , an international network of thousands of schools , universities , student residences ( iota ; s ? tkevis ) , and many associations and foundations . He is a financial heavyweight , controlling an unregulated and opaque budget estimated at $25 billion. n3 It is not clear whether the Fethullahist cemaat ( community ) supports the AKP or is the ruling force behind AKP . Either way , however , the effect is the same . <p> L : GLEN 'S BACKGROUND Born in Erzurum , Turkey , in 1942 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophet. n4 An enigmatic figure , many in the West applaud him as a reformist and advocate for tolerance , n5 a catalyst of " moderate Islam " for Turkey and beyond . He is praised in the West , especially in the United States , as an intellectual , scholar , and educator n6 even though his formal education is limited to five years of elementary school . After receiving an imam-preacher certificate , he served as an imam , first in Erdirne and later in Izmir . In 1971 , the Turkish security service arrested him for clandestine religious activities , such as running illegal summer camps to indoctrinate youths , and was , from that time on , occasionally harassed by the staunchly secular military. n7 In 1981 , he formally retired from his post as a local preacher . <p> To build an image as a proponent of interfaith dialogue , Glen met Pope John Paul II , other Christian clergy , and Jewish rabbis n8 and emphasizes the commonalities unifying Abrahamic religions . He presents himself and his movement as the modern-day version of tolerant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sufi thinkers such as Jalal ad-Din Rumi and Yunus Emre , pretending to share their moderate teachings. n9 Quotes from their teachings adorn Fethullah 's Glen 's propaganda material . The movement , its proxy organizations , and universities -- including Georgetown , to which it donates money -- hold conferences in the United States and Europe to discuss Glen . In October 2007 , the British House of Lords feted Glen with a conference in his honor . <p> Glen was a student and follower of Sheikh Sa'id-i Kurdi ( 1878-1960 ) , also known as Sa'idi Nursi , the founder of the Islamist Nur ( light ) movement. n10 After Turkey 's war of independence , Kurdi demanded , in an address to the new parliament , that the new republic be based on Islamic principles . He turned against Atatrk and his reforms and against the new modern , secular , Western republic . <p> In 1998 , Glen departed for the United States , reportedly to receive medical treatment for diabetes . However , his absence also enabled Glen to escape questioning on his indictment in 2000 for allegedly promoting insurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voluntary exile , Glen has resided on a large , rural estate in eastern Pennsylvania , together with about 100 followers , who guard him and tend to his needs . These servants are educated men who wear suits and ties and do not look like traditional Islamists in cloaks and turbans . They follow their hocaefendi 's orders and even refrain from marrying until age fifty per his instructions . When they do marry , their spouses are expected to dress in the Islamic manner , as dictated by Glen himself. n11 It is from his U.S. base that Glen has built his fame and his transnational empire . <p> L : GLEN 'S EDUCATION NETWORK The core of Glen 's network is his educational institutions . His school network is impressive . Nurettin Veren , Glen 's right-hand man for thirty-five years , estimated that some 75 percent of Turkey 's two million preparatory school students are enrolled in Glen institutions. n12 He controls thousands of top-tier secondary schools , colleges , and student dormitories throughout Turkey , as well as private universities , the largest being Fatih @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of secondary schools and dozens of universities in 110 countries worldwide . Glen 's aim is not altruistic : His followers target youth in the eighth through twelfth grades , mentor and indoctrinate them in the ? ls ? kevi , educate them in the Fethullah schools , and prepare them for future careers in legal , political , and educational professions in order to create the ruling classes of the future Islamist Turkish state . Taking their orders from Fethullah Glen , wealthy followers continue to open schools and ? s ? kevi in what Sabah columnist Emre Akz called " the education jihad. " ( n13 ) <p> The overt network of schools is only one part of a larger strategy . In a 2006 interview , Veren said , " These schools are like shop windows . Recruitment and Islamization activities are carried out through night classes ... Children whom we educated in Turkey are now in the highest positions . There are governors , judges , military officers . There are ministers in the government . They consult Glen before doing anything . " ( n14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Islamist indoctrination in Fethullahist schools , have accelerated the Islamization of Turkish society . During AKP 's first term in government , the Erdogan government has changed textbooks , emphasized religion courses , and transferred thousands of certified imams from their positions in the Directorate of Religious Affairs to positions as teachers and administrators in Turkey 's public schools. n15 Abdullah Gl , Turkey 's first Islamist president and a Glen sympathizer , appointed a Glen-affiliated professor , Yusuf Ziya zcan , to head Turkey 's Council of Higher Education ( Yksekgretim Kurulu , YK ) . He has also used his presidential prerogative to appoint Glen sympathizers to university presidencies . <p> Beyond Turkey , the Fethullahist schools also serve as fertile recruiting grounds . In his Institut d'Etudes Politiques doctoral thesis on Glen schools in Central Asia , Bayram Balci , a French scholar of Turkish origin , wrote , " Fethullah 's aim is the Islamization of Turkish nationality and the Turcification of Islam in foreign countries . Dozens of Fethullah 's ' Turkish schools ' abroad -- most of which are for boys -- are used to covertly ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' but through direct proselytism ' outside school . ' " Balci explained , " He wants to revive the link between state , religion , and society . " n16 The schools of Glen 's Nut movement in Central Asia have worked to reestablish Islam in a region largely secularized by decades of Soviet control . Balci explained , " The aim of the cemaat is to educate and influence future national elites , who will speak English and Turkish and who will one day prove their good intentions towards Fethullahists and towards Turkey . " Several countries in the region have taken steps against Glen 's educational institutions because of such suspicions . Uzbekistan has banned the schools for encouraging Islamic law , n17 and the Russian government , weary of the movement 's activities in majority Muslim regions of the federation , has banned not only the Glen schools but all activities of the entire Nur sect in the country. ( n18 ) <p> Neither Uzbekistan nor Russia are known for their pluralism , but suspicion about Glen indoctrination has spread even to more permissive societies such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Netherland 's Christian Democrat , Labor , and Conservative parties agreed to cut several million euros in government funding for organizations affiliated with " the Turkish imam Fethullah Glen " and to thoroughly investigate the activities of the Glen group after Erik Jan Zrcher , director of the Amsterdam-based International Institute for Social History , and five former Glen followers who had worked in Glen 's ? s ? kevi told Dutch television that the Glen community was moving step-by-step to topple the secular order. n19 While the organizations in question denied any ties to the Glen movement , Zrcher said that taqiya , religiously-sanctioned dissimulation , was typical in the movement 's interactions with the West . An unnamed former Glen follower who also once worked in Glen schools and ? s ? kevi reported that Fethullahists called the Dutch " filthy , blasphemous infidels " and that they said " the best Dutchman is one who has converted to Islam . All the Dutch must be made Muslims . " n20 Indeed , of the thousands of Fethullahist schools in more than one hundred countries that allegedly teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia or Iran that exist under domineering strains of official Islam , and most appear instead geared to radicalize students in secular Muslim and non-Muslim societies . <p> L : EVISCERATING CHECKS AND BALANCES Fethullahists have also made inroads into Turkey 's 200,000-strong police force . Their infiltration has had a compounding effect , as Fethullahist officials have purged officials more loyal to the republic than the hocaefendi . According to Veren , " There are imam security directors ; imams wearing police uniforms . Many police commissioners get their orders from imams. " n21 Adil Serdar Saan , former director of the organized crimes unit within the Istanbul Directorate of Security , confirmed these statements in reports he prepared on the Fethullahist organization within the security apparatus . In a 2006 interview , he said , <p> Fethullahists began organizing inside the security apparatus in the 1970s . In police academies , students were being taken to ? s ? kevi by class commissioners . One of those commissioners is now the director of intelligence at the Turkish Directorate of Security . During my time at the police academy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Glen organization were all pensioned off or fired in 2002 when the AKP came to power . ... I was at the top of my class when 1 graduated from the police academy , and throughout the twenty-four years of my career , I maintained and was honored for my stellar record . After 2002 , the AKP blocked my promotions . They promoted only those officers whose files were tainted with allegations that they were engaged in reactionary Islamist activities . ... Belonging to a certain cemaat has become a prerequisite for advancement in the force . At present , over 80 percent of the officers at supervisory level in the general security organization are members of the Glen cemaat. ( n22 ) <p> Such statements , however , may have consequences. n23 In October 2008 , Turkish police arrested Saan on suspicion of involvement in the so-called Ergenekon plot to overthrow the Turkish state. n24 Most Turkish analysts believe that the Ergenekon conspiracy , short of any evidence of unconstitutional activities , is more a mechanism by which the Turkish government can harass critics. ( n25 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamist penetration of the Ankara Directorate of Security . He explained , <p> Prior to Ramadan , personnel at the Directorate of Security in Ankara were asked whether they would be fasting during Ramadan , in order to establish the number of meals that would be needed during that period . Of the 4,200 employees , only seventeen indicated that they would not be fasting . Considering that some of the seventeen might have been sick or taking medications , the numbers speak for themselves. ( n26 ) <p> Wiretapping scandals in spring 2008 also highlighted Glenist penetration of the security service 's most important units . After the Turkish Security Directorate obtained a blanket court permit in April 2007 to monitor and record all the communications in Turkey including mobile and land-line telephones , SMS text messaging , email , fax , and Internet communications , n27 Turks have grown uneasy about having telephone conversations fearing intrusion into their privacy . Recent leaks to pro-AKP media of recordings of military personnel meetings , lectures , top secret military documents , strategic antiterrorism plans , private medical files of commanders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation as has the appearance on the Internet video site YouTube of some of those recordings . <p> The alleged network of Fethullah followers in the security system has an impact on domestic affairs as they use restricted technology or privileged information to further their political agenda . In February 2008 , for example , several websites posted the voice recording of a secret speech delivered by Brig . Gen. Mnir Erten announcing the timing of an upcoming Turkish military operation into Iraqi Kurdistan , details of a private discussion with the chief of the General Staff , and private information concerning Gen. Ergin Saygun 's health. n28 The following month , several websites including YouTube posted a secretly recorded conversation between prosecutor Salim Demirci and a colleague regarding Erdogan and Efkan Ala , then governor of Diyarbakir and subsequently a counselor of Erdogan 's office . Erdogan responded by ordering a criminal investigation against Demirci. n29 In June 2008 , the Islamist Vakit published Saygun 's entire medical file , disclosing information about his diabetes as well as the treatments and medications he had received in the Glhane military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Islamist websites and in Glen 's newspaper network included Erdogan Tezi , the former head of Turkey 's Higher Education Council , and prominent members of the center-left opposition Republican People 's Party ( Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi , CHP ) . Many Turkish journalists believe that Fethullahist-dominated police tap their communications , and according to reports , the head of the wiretapping unit , who was appointed by Erdogan in August 2005 , is a Fethullah follower. n31 Islamist newspapers including Vakit , Yeni Safak , Zaman , and the pro-AKP Taraf published leaks from private conversations held inside government offices and military headquarters . The Islamist , pro-AKP media has reported alleged confidential evidence relating to the police investigation of the so-called Ergenekon plot that posits a secularist cabal of military officers , journalists , and professors sought to overthrow the AKP government. n32 The net effect of such leaks is to tar the reputations of or intimidate AKP 's political opponents and the Turkish military . <p> Islamization within police ranks also contributes to police brutality against anti-AKP demonstrators . On May 1 , 2008 , the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clubs against workers who wanted to celebrate May Day peacefully in Istanbul 's Taksim Square , the traditional site of demonstrations in Turkey 's largest city ; scores were injured. n33 Labor unions and opposition parties condemned the police brutality and accused Erdogan of using police to silence opposition voices. n34 Police also suppressed labor protests in Tuzla ( Istanbul ) shipyards. n35 Similarly , police have harassed individual citizens after they criticized Erdogan 's policies . Erdogan 's own security guards abducted a 46-year-old man from Antalya for speaking out in public against his social security policies , taking the man to a deserted location where the guards beat and threatened him . The victim alleged that his attackers said they could easily plant guns or drugs on him and kill him. ( n36 ) <p> While Turkey 's military is guarantor of the constitution , Veren alleged that Fethullahists had also entrenched themselves within the military , police , and other professions : <p> The Fethullahist military officers were once our students , who we financially supported , educated , and assisted . When these grateful children graduated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions at the service of Fethullah Glen ... Glen directs and instructs , and , through them maintains power within the state ... When Glen 's students graduate from the police or military academies -- as do the new doctors and lawyers -- they present their first salaries to Fethullah Glen as a gesture of their gratitude . Newly graduated officers even bring him the swords that they receive during the graduation ceremony. ( n37 ) <p> According to Veren , Glen has argued that the military expels no more than one in forty Islamist officers ; " the rest remain in undercover cells . While such allegations may seem the stuff of conspiracy theory , recent leaks to pro-AKP media suggest it number of Islamist sources within the military ranks , creating speculation that followers of Glen now populate the senior infrastructure of the Turkish General Staff . Such speculation gained additional credence after the August 2008 Supreme Military Council ( Yksek Askeri Sura , YAS ) , which , for the first time , declined to expel suspected Islamists from military ranks . <p> The AKP government has also aided the Glen movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years of his rule , Erdogan replaced thousands of judges and prosecutors with AKP appointees . Now that the president is Islamist , it is unlikely that he would veto the appointment of Islamists to the bench , as did his predecessor Ahmet Necdet Sezer . Indeed , it now appears that the government intends to appoint thousands more to judicial positions. n35 The AKP has also enacted a law that would require applicants for judgeships to first interview with AKP bureaucrats in order better to gauge and adjudicate applicants ' adherence to Islam . The results of the AKP 's targeting of the judicial system are already apparent as anti-secular , pro-AKP officials have been at the forefront of some controversial trials , such as the case against Van University president Ycel Askin , n39 the Semdinli investigation in which the prosecutor tried to implicate Gen. Yasar Bykanit before he became chief of the General Staff , and , most recently , the Ergenekon probe . <p> Indeed , it is such overtly political and vindictive prosecutions that have led some former Glen sympathizers , such as University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . In one interview , Yavuz told odatv.com that four important legal cases had changed his thinking : the case against Askin ; the Semdinli case ; the Atabeyler operation , uncovered in 2005 , involving an organized crime group with alleged plans to assassinate Prime Minister Erdogan ( n40 ) ; and the Ergenekon probe . Yavuz explained , " The cemaat has attempted to steer all four cases . Look at the slanderous reports in archives of the cemaat 's newspapers , how they defamed Yucel Askin . And now it 's Ergenekon . Keeping prominent personalities in jail for over a year without indictment is inexplicable . " Yavuz also suggested Glen 's cemaat spoke differently to its members than to outsiders and that it was pursuing a political agenda that conflicted with the founding philosophy of the modem Turkish republic . He accused Fethullahists of " co-optation " and said that they were recruiting people and paying them money -- without any formal receipts or records -- to write and speak favorably about the movement while criticizing the secular Turkish state. ( n41 ) <p> L : THE FIFTH ESTATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect rule-of-law from within official Turkish government structures , there might still be an external check to abuse of power in the Turkish media . The Turkish media has traditionally been relentless in its reporting of abuses of power and corruption . Soon after assuming office , however , Erdogan proved intolerant of the concept of a free press . The AKP government has systematically sought to create a media monopoly to speak with one voice and on behalf of the government . Erdogan lashes out at media organs that he does not control . In his first term , Erdogan brought more than a hundred lawsuits against sixty-three journalists in sixteen publications , against many writers , as well as the leaders and members of parliament of all opposition parties . The number of lawsuits may be far greater . In 2008 , Erdogan declined to answer a parliamentary inquiry by a Democratic Left Party deputy demanding information on how many lawsuits Erdogan had initiated against journalists -- claiming that such information was in the realm of his private life. n42 Most of Erdogan 's lawsuits against journalists involve criticism that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , he sued Cumhuriyet cartoonist Musa Kart for depicting him as a cat entangled in a ball of string . Last year , he sued the LeMan weekly humor magazine for ridiculing him in its January 30 , 2008 cover. ( n43 ) <p> Erdogan lost some of his lawsuits , and courts threw out others , but the effect has nonetheless been chilling . Journalists know that not only does the prime minister seek to make them financially liable for any criticism but that the AKP might even seek to assume control of their publications . During AKP 's 6-year rule , the government has seized control of several media outlets and subsequently sold them to pro-AKP holdings affiliated with the Glen community . In April 2007 , for example , the governmental Saving Deposit Insurance Fund ( Tasarruf Mevduati Sigorta Fonu , TMSF ) seized Sabah-ATV , Turkey 's second largest media group in a predawn raid . The TMSF , staffed by Erdogan appointees , then sold the group to alik Holding , the CEO of which is Erdogan 's son-in-law . alik financed the purchase with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by partnering with a newly-founded , Qatar-based media company that bought 25 percent of Sabah shares . It was Abdullah Gl who introduced Ahmet alik to Qatari Emir Hamad bin Khalifa during his January 2008 visit in Syria ; alik also accompanied Gl in February and Erdogan in April when they visited Qatar . Media reports indicated that other consortiums that had initially shown interest in purchasing Sabah-ATV with their own money pulled out of the tender shortly before the bid after Erdogan contacted them , leaving alik the sole bidder. n44 Sabah has since become a strong advocate of the AKP government . In September 2008 , Erdogan demanded all party members and aides boycott newspapers owned by the Dogan Media Group after it reported on laundering of money to Islamist charities. ( n45 ) <p> Excluding the Islamist television and radio stations , newspapers such as Zaman , Sabah , Yeni Safak , Trkiye , Star , Bugn , Vakit , and Taraf all have AKP and/or Glen-affiliated ownership . By circulation , such papers represent at least 40 percent of all newspaper sales in Turkey. ( n46 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long had a dominant position in Turkish society . Secular businessmen such as Aydin Dogan and Mehmet Emin Karamehmet have interests not only in industry but also in media , the banking sector , and even education . Never before , though , has a single individual started a movement that seeks to transform Turkish society so fundamentally . Glen now wields a vocal partisan media ; a vast network of loyal bureaucrats ; partisan universities and academia ; partisan prosecutors and judges ; partisan security and intelligence agencies ; partisan capitalists , business associations , NGOs , and labor unions ; and partisan teachers , doctors , and hospitals . What makes Glen so dangerous ? Glen 's own teaching and sermons provide the best answers . <p> In 1999 , Turkish television aired footage of Glen delivering sermons to a crowd of followers in which he revealed his aspirations for an Islamist Turkey ruled by Shari'a ( Islamic law ) as well as the methods that should be used to attain that goal . In the sermons , he said : <p> You must move in the arteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach all the power centers ... until the conditions are ripe , they the followers must continue like this . If they do something prematurely , the world will crush our heads , and Muslims will suffer everywhere , like in the tragedies in Algeria , like in 1982 in Syria ... like in the yearly disasters and tragedies in Egypt . The time is not yet right . You must wait for the time when you are complete and conditions are ripe , until we can shoulder the entire world and carry it ... You must wait until such time as you have gotten all the state power , until you have brought to your side all the power of the constitutional institutions in Turkey ... Until that time , any step taken would be too early -- like breaking an egg without waiting the full forty days for it to hatch . It would be like killing the chick inside . The work to be done is in confronting the world . Now , I have expressed my feelings and thoughts to you all -- in confidence ... trusting your loyalty and secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discard your empty juice boxes , you must discard the thoughts and the feelings that I expressed here . <p> He continued , <p> When everything was closed and all doors were locked , our houses of isik light assumed a mission greater than that of older times . In the past , some of the duties of these houses were carried out by madrasas Islamic schools , some by schools , some by tekkes Islamist lodges ... These isik homes had to be the schools , had to be madrasas , had to be tekkes all at the same time . The permission did not come from the state , or the state 's laws , or the people who govern us . The permission was given by God ... who wanted His name learned and talked about , studied , and discussed in those houses , as it used to be in the mosques. ( n47 ) <p> In another sermon , Glen said , <p> Now it is a painful spring that we live in . A nation is being born again . A nation of millions is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing ... It is being born with its own culture , its own civilization . If giving birth to one person is so painful , the birth of millions can not be pain-free . Naturally we will suffer pain . It wo n't be easy for a nation that has accepted atheism , has accepted materialism , a nation accustomed to running away from itself , to come back riding on its horse . It will not be easy , but it is worth all our suffering and the sacrifices. ( n48 ) <p> And , in yet another sermon , he declared , <p> The philosophy of our service is that we open a house somewhere and , with the patience of a spider , we lay our web to wait for people to get caught in the web ; and we teach those who do . We do n't lay the web to eat or consume them but to show them the way to their resurrection , to blow life into their dead bodies and souls , to give them a life. ( n49 ) <p> Many Glen supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested the sermons were somehow forged n50 but the denials are unconvincing given the video footage and reports by Glen movement defectors . <p> L : U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR GLEN ? Many Turkish analysts believe that , prior to Erdogan 's election , Glen and his supporters in the U.S. government helped obtain an invitation to the White House for him at a time when Erdogan was banned from politics in Turkey due to his Islamist activities -- an event viewed as a U.S. endorsement ahead of the 2002 Turkish elections . That the U.S. government and , specifically , the Central Intelligence Agency support the Glen movement is conventional wisdom among Turkey 's secular elite even though no hard evidence exists to support such allegations . <p> When Turkish secularists are asked to defend the view that Glen enjoys U.S. support , they often point to his almost 20-year residence in eastern Pennsylvania . After the Supreme Court of Appeals in Turkey ( Yargitay ) confirmed on June 24 , 2008 , a lower court 's ruling to acquit Glen on charges that he organized an illegal terrorist organization to overthrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , this time in the United States . A federal court reversed U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service decisions that would have denied Glen 's application for permanent residency in the United States on the basis that Glen did not fit the criteria as someone with " extraordinary ability in the field of education . " The Department of Homeland Security characterized Glen as neither an expert in the field of education nor an educator but rather as " the leader of a large and influential religious and political movement with immense commercial holdings . " ( n51 ) <p> While the court ruling that allowed Glen to remain in the United States may provide fodder for Turkish analysts who suggest U.S. support for Glen , the process is actually more revealing . Indeed , the U.S. government noted that much of the acclaim Glen touts is sponsored or financed by his own movement . Glen attached twenty-nine letters of reference to his June 18 , 2008 motion , mostly from theologians or Turkish political figures close to or affiliated with his , organization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding , who , after receiving donations from the Glen movement sponsored a conference in his honor , also supplied a reference . Two former CIA officials , George Fidas and Graham Fuller , and former U.S. ambassador to Turkey Morton Abramowitz also supplied references . <p> The letters may have worked . On July 16 , 2008 , U.S. district judge Stewart Dalzell issued a memorandum and order granting Glen 's motion for partial summary judgment and ordering the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service to approve his petition for alien worker status as an alien of extraordinary ability by August 1 , 2008 . The court found that the immigration examiner improperly concluded that the field of education was the only statutory category in which Glen 's accomplishments could fit and that Glen 's accomplishments in such fields as theology , political science , and Islamic studies should also be considered . The court further determined that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service Administrative Appeals Office erred in concluding that Glen 's work was not " scholarly " by applying an unduly narrow definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement that the applicant show that his or her entry into the United States would substantially benefit the United States , the court found that Glen had met the requirement. ( n52 ) <p> Regardless of the legal rationale behind his current stay , the U.S. decision to grant Glen residency will enable his movement to continue to imply Washington 's endorsement as the AKP and its Fethullahist supporters seek to push Turkey further away from the secularism upon which it was built . <p> L : CONCLUSIONS Glen enjoys the support of many friends , ideological fellow-travelers , and co-opted journalists and academics . Too often , concern over Glen 's activities is dismissed in the Turkish , U.S. , and European media as mere paranoia . When Turkey 's chief prosecutor indicted the AKP for attempting to undermine the secular constitution , the pro-Islamist media in Turkey along with Western diplomats and journalists dismissed the case as an " undemocratic judicial coup . " n53 Yet at the same time , many of the same outlets and officials have hailed the Ergenekon indictment , assuming a dichotomy between Islamism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other. n54 The repeated branding in Islamist outlets of Turkey 's Islamists as " reformist democrats " and of modern , secular Turks as " fundamentalists " has to be one of the most offensive but sadly effective lies in modern politics . <p> Indeed , Turkey has never seen a single incident of attacks on pious Muslims for fasting during Ramadan , whereas in recent years there have been many incidents of attacks on less-observant Turks for drinking alcohol or not fasting. n55 While women who cover their heads in the Islamic manner can move freely in any area of the country , uncovered women are increasingly unwelcome in certain regions and are often attacked. ( n56 ) <p> Contrary to the impression prevalent in the West -- that the conflict is between religious Muslims and " anti-religion , secular Kemalists "  - -  the fact remains that the majority of Turks , secular included , are traditional and observant Muslims many of whom define themselves primarily as " Muslims first . " n57 While the Turkish constitution recognizes all Turkish citizens as " Turks , " the dominant sentiment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Turk , one must be Muslim . The complete absence of any non-Muslim governor , ambassador , or military or police officer attests to the prevalence of Islam 's dominance in the Turkish establishment . Therefore , it appears Glen is not fighting for more individual freedoms but to free Islam from the confines of the mosque and the private domain of individuals and to bring it to the public arena , to govern every aspect of life in the country. n58 AKP leaders , including Gill and Erdogan , have repeatedly expressed their opposition to the " imprisonment of Islam in the mosque , " demanding that it be present everywhere as a lifestyle . Most Turks vividly remember statements by AKP leaders not long ago rejecting the definition of secularism as " separation of mosque and state . " Gill has slammed " secularism " on many occasions , including during a November 27 , 1995 interview with The Guardian . What Turkey 's Islamists really want is to remove the founding principles of the Turkish Republic . So long as U.S. and Western officials fail to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may be setting the stage for a dialogue , albeit not of religious tolerance , but rather to find an answer to the question , " Who lost Turkey ?
