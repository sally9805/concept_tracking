<p> Word was that Cecile Weich 's penthouse was unusual , but the 30 members of a professional women 's group invited in for a networking " salon " were not prepared for the sight that met their eyes . <p> Mirrors . Mirrors everywhere . Wall to wall . Floor to ceiling . Mirrors , in fact , completely covering the ceiling . Mirrors on light switches and kitchen cabinets . On the frames of French doors leading to the balcony . Inside the steam shower . <p> If they had peeked inside the closets , they would have found mirrors there too . <p> Weich , who wears only white , has mirrored everything but the floors of her condo at 701 Pennsylvania Ave . Out on the balcony , guests , who had been asked to remove their shoes , paused to admire the alabaster dome of the Capitol . Inside , wherever they gazed , they could marvel at the sight of themselves reflected over and over and over again . " There we were in our dress-for-success suits and our stocking feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls Pamela Heyne , who was there . " If you looked in the corners , you saw yourself multipled four times . If you stood between two mirrors that faced each other , you literally saw yourself reflected into infinity , " says Heyne , an architect and expert on the use of mirrors . <p> As the author of " Mirror by Design : Using Reflection to Transform Space " ( John Wiley &; Sons , Inc. 1996 ) , Heyne should be accustomed to the effect . But even she said , " Ultimately , you did n't feel like you were looking at mirrors . It was like an ice palace  --  a totally crystalline environment where anything solid with mirror on it , dematerialized and disappeared . " <p> Weich 's reflective theme extends to the furniture , which is mostly mirrored surfaces and see-through Lucite , including an all but invisible grand piano , a Kawasaki . Weich believes the secret of decorating is to just be yourself . So far , the cost of mirroring as a vehicle for self-expression is about $ 250,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate , has a home and practice in New York as well as Washington . In the apartment she has shared with her husband , Robert , in the Riverdale section of the Bronx for 20 years , she has at least 200 mirrors in individual frames . In Washington , where her two grown sons and three grandchildren live , she cranked up the glitz and mirrored the whole place . <p> She started with a one-bedroom unit , purchased five years ago . She mirrored it to make it feel larger . Finding the apartment still too small for comfort , she added one next door . The two one-bedroom units have been joined to make an open-plan environment , 40 feet wide and 30 feet from front to back . The extra space has come in handy for entertaining . " What , " she asks , " is the fun of having all this unless you can show it off ? " <p> Recently , Weich showed a visitor through the kaleidoscopic pied-a-terre . She had been working on a child custody case . Papers were neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mirrored desk . To the right , was the law library , mounted on a mirrored wall . Everything , including a barefoot Weich dressed in her signature white , was being reflected in the foyer . " To live like this , you have to like to look at yourself , " she says . " Everywhere you look is you . " <p> One possible downside is the reverse periscope effect produced by mirrors placed at right angles . " I can lie in bed and look at the ceiling , " says Weich , " and see what my husband is eating in the kitchen . " At this moment , however , Bob Weich , who runs special promotions for Sony Corp. , was sitting on the white angora sofa , trying to read . He was wearing a brown suit reflected into infinity in the wall opposite the Capitol dome . <p> The study of reflections has fascinated all manner of notables . Leonardo da Vinci , who wrote backward with a little help from a mirror , once observed that a candle centered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progression . Later , in their haute 1897 how-to book , " The Decoration of Houses , " Edith Wharton and Ogden Codman Jr . held forth about the " glittering perspective , " the " air of fantastic unreality " and " illusion of distance " produced by multiple mirrors and one crystal chandelier in the grandeur of an 18th-century French ballroom . <p> With no formal background in optics or , for that matter , decorating , Weich has reached the same conclusions . Plus , mirroring is practical , she says . Unlike paint and wallpaper , " you put it up and that 's it . " Except , perhaps , for the occasional spritz of Windex . <p> How would she describe her place ? " It 's an expression of my personality , " she says , flashing a broad smile . " I 'm dramatic and flamboyant  --  a little over the edge . I 'm also a serious , substantial lawyer . I 've helped a lotta , lotta people . " <p> Bill Owens , a Waldorf glazier who did most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well into the job , but he had a preview of what was to come . He was cutting mirror , watching the TV out of the corner of his eye , when an arresting figure appeared on screen . " It was a talk show about divorce , and this woman comes on  --  crazy white hat , white hair  --  she 's all in white , " says Owens . " I 'm thinking , ' I 've seen this lady somewhere before . ' " He remembered a photograph on the piano . " I go over there and , know what ? It 's the same woman who 's on television . " <p> Weich specializes in women 's legal rights including divorce and child custody law and sexual harassment in the workplace . Widely quoted in the press , Weich has appeared on Geraldo , Donahue , Sally Jessy Raphael and Oprah . Framed press clips detail her legal victories and speaking engagements . <p> The mirror thing goes back almost 40 years when a grateful client presented Weich with an antique , gold-framed looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it still in the Bronx . <p> Overlooking the confluence of the Harlem and the Hudson rivers  --  a spot the Dutch called Spuyten Duyvil  --  the Weichs 's high-rise apartment is twice the size of the one here , but the decor is clearly by the same hand , down to the mirrored bathroom scale . <p> As in Washington , there is Lucite , horn , white marabou and fur . Bearskin rugs  --  a grizzly and a polar bear with long claws and sharp teeth  --  make for perilous passage in shoeless feet . <p> Weich was n't born with the proverbial silver spoon . Her father was " gone " in the Air Force ; her mother died when she was 16 . " I came home from the funeral and went to work , " Weich says . " I was a dance hall girl , a bar maid . . . a secretary . Anything to make a buck . I pushed to educate myself . I wanted to make a living , and I did n't want to make a small living . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of ' 59 , she opened an office in her bedroom and trolled night court for clients . She won her first case defending a woman on a prostitution charge . When a guest at her Washington " salon " said the condo looked like a brothel , Weich says , " I looked her straight in the eye and asked , ' How do you know ? Have you been in one ? Well , ' I said , ' I have . ' " <p> Glancing at the mirror in front of her desk , she could see the Capitol and everything else behind her : twin platform sofas with Lucite bases ; the bed , which has a mirror headboard ; the mirrored fireplace with a steer skull a la Georgia O'Keeffe . <p> Should a client appear , she says , " all I have to do is push a button " and to demonstrate , she does . Automatic doors slide out from pockets . Mirrored on both sides , they hide the bed from view , enclose a 9-by-12-foot area containing the desk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surround . Push another button and a television set rises from a mirrored cabinet . Another button opens and closes reflective plastic vertical blinds . " Is this not wonderful ? " she asks with genuine delight . <p> The gizmos , the reconfiguration of the space and much of the furniture are the creation of a general contractor , John Wahler , also from Waldorf , who happened to be working in the building when Weich moved in . " I think it up , and John makes it . He can make anything , " she says . <p> Wahler remembers beginning with the bathroom . " First , we made it bigger . Then we mirrored the ceiling , walls and vanity . " Then came the kitchen . It was n't until Weich asked him to mirror the insides of the closets that he realized the totality of her vision , which extends to air vent covers . <p> A few of her favorite things , however , came from other sources , including the Georgetown flea market . " I have a good eye , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's find ; a huge white plaster kitten was " three bucks from the side of the road . The " light wall , " an extravaganza consisting of 72 Hollywood-type bulbs encased in a grid of mirrored lattice , the joint invention of Wahler 's brother-in-law , an electrician , and Owens , the mirror man . The faux moose antler chair came from Connecticut " for 900 bucks and some change , " Weich says . " I haggle well . " <p> " You feel very comfortable knowing she 's on your side , " says Karen Staser , founder and president of the National Museum of Women 's History , which Weich represents . The group spearheaded the effort to move the statue of three suffragists from the Capitol basement to the Rotunda . <p> As for Weich 's Washington home away from home , Staser says , " it 's one of a kind , just like her  --  a reflection of Cecile in all her glory . Once you 've seen her or her penthouse , " she says , " you 'll never forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important issue when installing mirrors , experts say . For residential projects such as Cecile Weich 's condo , they recommend plate glass 1/4-inch thick with backing composed of a layer of silver , a layer of copper and a sealer . It weighs three pounds per square foot . <p> Professionals offer these caveats : <p> For ceilings : Check local codes ; mirrored ceilings are prone to thermal and seismic failure . Use only safety mirror or acrylic " mirror " panels less than two feet square . A framing grid such as that for acoustical ceiling tiles with a continuous border to support the mirror on four sides is preferable to a direct application to a ceiling . <p> For walls : Use mirror mastic ( adhesive ) plus fasteners or clips to support the bottom edge ; do n't apply to glossy surfaces . Use moisture-resistant drywall and avoid exterior walls where condensation can be a problem . To prevent distortion waves ( a " fun house " effect ) be sure walls are plumb and the mastic is evenly applied . <p> For more information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S.W.
