<p> THE title of Thomas Wolfe 's last work of fiction , " You Ca n't Go Home Again , " has been taken too literally . It is his phrasing we recall , but he was a writer , not a prophet . Yes , you can go home again , so long as you do n't expect the place to be where you were when you were young . The longing to go back is ever present , no matter how far you 've wandered . And for some of us , it 's not just going back ; it 's going back and starting over , a daunting prospect at best . <p> Any journey begins with a single step , and that first step occurs in the mind and in the heart . Whether you 're going home where you were raised or to a place where you feel at home , it is still the first step on your way to becoming . <p> In my old house , in a small Georgia town , my studio looked out into a garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled each day with the flutter of bright wings . I knew when I left that I 'd miss the birds terribly . They had become dear to me on those long days of isolation when I worked at the typewriter . <p> The day I moved into the row house in the historic district of Savannah , I put up the bird feeder in the courtyard . It took about a week for the birds to discover it . A pair of cardinals arrived first , followed by the ubiquitous Savannah sparrows , then other birds came . The day after I put up the feeder , I went down the street to a small restaurant for a late lunch . The cobbled street was quiet and as I walked , I caught a glimpse of wings as overhead a huge bird moved soundlessly and disappeared into the canopy of live oak trees . Startled , I tried to find him again but he was gone . I looked around to see if anyone else had seen the bird , but the street was largely deserted except for a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if I 'd asked him . <p> Later that day , I was out in the courtyard trying to decide where I could hang my dolphin wind chime . I looked up and saw the huge bird I 'd glimpsed earlier . It was a hawk , his wingspread easily three feet as he soared on invisible currents high above the rooftops . Seeing him was an unexpected pleasure . Just as Angus , the rooster who lives across the back lane , was an unexpected pleasure . Here , in the old section of this most feminine city , churches lift slender spires above the trees . My days have become defined by church bells . Each morning , the angelus is rung from the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist , a few blocks away . And as if on cue , Angus begins to crow . It is a surprising sound , and a good one . <p> NEW places offer more than geographical change . They also offer a mental distance from the recent past that allows you to get your life in perspective . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Remember when your grandmother used to tell you to " be careful what you wish for , you might get it " ? Well , I had what I 'd wished for and now I had to deal with it . I had my change of vision but it 's the change of heart , the inner vision that comes hard , that wakes you in the night . <p> At some point , in a new move , you find yourself alone with the sounds of the house and sounds of your heart . That second night , there were alien sounds in the night ; unexpected creaks and thumps that cause the heart to pound as you listen . But there was something else to keep me awake . There were the voices in my head . I sat up in bed , watchful and alert . What have I done ? I listened . Are these thoughts that challenge and second-guess ? I had done what I wanted . Why do I have to be afraid now ? " Rejoice ! " echoed through the silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> These were not the still , small voices I 'd learned to heed . These were more demanding , more frightening and strident . But what were these thoughts that hovered like wings in the darkness ? Perhaps they 're angels . The kind of angels that Anne Morrow Lindbergh wrote about in her book , " Gift From the Sea . " She spoke of them as " angels of annunciation , " angels to be reckoned with . <p> BECOMING anything is a journey , and along the way we have to watch for signs that presage growth . Discontent , restlessness , doubt , despair , and longing are accepted in youth as growing pains , but at mid-life are looked upon as typical crises . But signs of growth are good at any age and should be used . It 's good to have a struggle . It 's painful , but it 's good . It 's the act of becoming . <p> Simone de Beauvoir wrote that , " One is not born a woman , one becomes one . " I can write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Savannah had to do with becoming . A need to discover who I am and who I was after being wife and mother and general camp follower for 25 years . <p> New beginnings are n't always mid-life beginnings , of course . But for the first two decades of adult life , most of us , male and female , are busy raising families , trying to make it in the marketplace and establishing priorities . We do n't have time for introspection . And then one day we 're faced with - is this all there is ? For some , the question will be tamped down , shoved to the back of the mind like last year 's clothes in a mental closet . The questions are too painful and require too much thought and the possibility of change . But for some of us , not dealing with it is more painful than dealing with it . Yet you know that you 're only biding time . Sooner or later , the acknowledgment that something has to be done has to be faced . " Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 years ago . Our angels of annunciation must be faced , frightening though they be . <p> After 40 , those new beginnings seem even more threatening in the face of America 's emphasis on youth , action , and success . But we can not compete with our sons and daughters - ours is a different growth . " Who is not afraid of pure space - that breathtaking empty space of an open door ? But despite fear , one goes through to the room beyond , " writes Lindbergh . New beginnings mean that we must walk through that door , enter that space and find meaning in the act . The writer and actress , Liv Ullman , wrote : " In search of my lost innocence , I walked out a door . At the time I believed I was looking for a purpose , but I found instead the meaning of choice . " <p> ON the third day in the new house , when the boxes were still to be unpacked and the house looked like a bomb had exploded , I drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . The weather had changed from balmy to brisk . I drove to the south end of Tybee Island where a jetty extends out into the water . There used to be a real jetty there , but over the years the sands have eroded and now there are huge boulders placed there to prevent further erosion . At that time of the morning , the strand was deserted except for a young man in a wet suit , paddling a surf board in a green sea that did n't have much surf . I suppose that at that time of day most people are working and only writers and other misfits are wandering around loose . <p> As I stood there looking out to see , a curved fin appeared , then another , smaller one . Two dolphins , a mother and her calf , were feeding at the end of the jetty . The mother was swimming in her elegant dolphin " roll " while the baby popped up like a cork , still uncertain in his guise . They were dark gray , almost black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I watched . I walked , or slipped my way , farther out and stopped a few feet away from them . A few minutes later , the young man in the wet suit paddled out to where they were , using his surf board as a raft as he watched them . <p> Do you remember how you used to hug yourself when you were a child - with anticipation or joy ? Watching those two dolphins gave me such a feeling of joy that I hugged myself as I stood on the rocks watching them move so elegantly . They were so beautiful they took my breath away . And as I watched , it all came together for me . The move , the planning , the fear , the feeling of " what have I done ? " coalesced into knowledge that whatever happened I had made the right move . My angels spoke and I listened . <p> Now , a month later , I look out the kitchen window to see sparrows and chickadees fighting for space on the feeder . At 10 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hairy leaves of the scented geraniums are silvered and shining . A wren perches on the courtyard wall and looks as sturdy and serious as a Breton housewife at market . <p> On my daily walk , I stop to admire a pot of pansies on a neighbor 's stoop . The petals , like the velvety wings of moths , are so deep a purple as to seem black . Something stirs in memory and a sense of deja vu envelopes me . I am enrobed in memory as the petals are enrobed in velvet . I am drawn to the center , to that place that Gerald Manley Hopkins wrote about where " there is the dearest freshness deep down things . " And even though I suffer occasional " birthing pains , " as you do with any creative act , I am aware of that " dearest freshness " that is a part of my journey , too . And on a day in winter , when the weather is so warm that camellias bloom in the courtyards along Jones Street , I rejoice that I @ @ @ @ @
