THE DAYS AFTER BARBARA 'S DEATH had not been a period of time but a place of a certain shape , a place where Shirley had to crouch down and hold still because it was the only thing to do . <p> On the day of the memorial service she had begun to be able to stop crouching . She found that she was with Angus and Jen , Barbara 's children . But since Barbara was not there , she did not know what her relationship with them was or ought to be . Angus had behaved as a son ; but of course he was a son , Barbara 's son ; but not her son . But kind , quietly and efficiently kind , unhesitating . And now , the day after the service , he was going . <p> Shirley had only threadbare words . " I do n't know what I would have done without you . " <p> But he had something to say , and said it : " My father should have come to the service . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan had n't been there ; but Angus was right . <p> " Daddy does n't come . Daddy has back spasms , " said Jen , predictably savage . " You graduate from law school , he has a back spasm . I graduate from law school , he has a back spasm . He wo n't come to his own funeral . Just ca n't move , terrible pain , you 'd better bury somebody else ! " <p> " I 'm sorry he was n't there , " Angus said , direct , severe . <p> He kissed his sister , putting his arm round her shoulders in a reassuring , brotherly way that Shirley found pleasant , though Jen 's angularity did not visibly soften to it . He kissed Shirley lightly , without an embrace ; she patted his tweed shoulder . He went down to his car , got in , glanced unsmiling farewell to them up on the porch , and drove off down Clark Street in a spurt of dusty gravel . <p> " What a good man . A proper man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow the dust in a golden haze onto the Hanningers ' geraniums . <p> " You are n't supposed to say that . " <p> Alarmed and discomfited , a trespasser , Shirley said nothing . <p> Jen , who usually stooped , stood puffed up , speaking in a slow , gobbling voice : " You hate men . You want men castrated . " <p> Jen was doing an imitation of her father , Shirley realized as she went on  --  " Better yet , abort ' em all  --  " just in Dan McDermid 's gobbling , pompous voice , but crying at the same time . Shirley looked away at once , more dismayed than ever . <p> " I think Angus looks like Gary Cooper , " she said . <p> Jen said nothing , and Shirley wondered if she knew who Gary Cooper was . All the names had changed , and nobody knew the ones she knew . Since they moved to Klatsand five years ago , she and Barbara had seen no movies and watched nothing on television except what Barbara called MacNeill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but surely Sean Connery was not an old man , and when she had mentioned Sean Connery the other day to little Chelsea Houk in the bakery , the girl had looked quite blank . But then she generally looked blank , faced with anybody over twenty . Jen was going on crying , silently , so Shirley had to go on talking , trying to save face for both of them , and to hide the fact that they were afraid to touch each other . <p> " Angus is moral , too , the way Gary Cooper was , " she said , " I mean in his movies , I suppose he was just a movie star really . But that kind of moral vulnerability . Just the opposite of all that digging in and resisting , that moral armament sort of thing . It 's like rock , but it 's exposed  --  vulnerable . What my grandmother called character . ' People do n't seem to use that word any more , do they ? " <p> It would n't do . Jen continued proudly strangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and patted the thin shoulder , muttering , " It 's all right , " while Jen stood rigid with resistance , gasping , " It 's all right ! " <p> In desperation , Shirley went down the two steps into the yard and began to pull up pigweed . <p> She wished Jen would go too , go soon . They had no comfort for each other . She was all right now , she could stand up , and she wanted to eat when she wanted to eat , and to go down to the beach alone , not leaving Jen in the house alone . <p> The strip of ground between the porch and the wobbly paling fence was hardly wide enough to kneel in , crammed with the fits and starts of Barbara 's gardening , impatiens , lobelia , roses , tiger lilies throttled in pigweed . Shirley got down on her knees to free the lilies . As soon as her hands touched the sandy dirt , the image of the stones in Cornwall came back into her mind . She knew then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , that it was what she had seen listening to Barbara 's long , loud , widely spaced last breaths , and that now it was the image of herself , the shape she was in her soul . <p> Three slabs of uncut granite , a roof weighing down on two parallel walls . Earth had been piled over that stone house , a great mound of dirt . It had blown away over the centuries like the dust from the wheels of Angus 's Honda , a haze of dust in the long autumn light , in the sea wind . Nothing was left but the stone slab walls , the stone slab roof , the wind blowing through . <p> She and Barbara had seen the stone places on their two-week walking tour of Dorset and Cornwall , their honeymoon Barbara had called it once but only once , after which they had agreed not to use the wrong names just because there were no right ones . They had entered together under the roof , crouching down , between the walls . Now with her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sea wind , that other sunlight , and was aware of the shadow inside the walls of weathered stone leaning inward to the roof , a cold , clear darkness . The floor was dirt . They were graves , those places . Quoits , they were called , in Cornwall . They stood about on the worn slopes of the hills over the sea . They were not single graves ; they had had a door , a fourth stone , pivoted ; it remained on some of them . By that door , time after time , the dead had gone in and the living had come out . Like Romeo and Juliet , and Tybalt lying there keeping them company under his sheets and cerements. , and older bones of older Capulets , companionable . Death used to be not a hole but a house . <p> There has to be some kind of companionship , Shirley thought . <p> Angus was probably Jen 's truest companion . Her mother dead , her father a bully , her husband remarried , no kids  --  unless there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ? With all the moving about and the breakdown of family and then , of course , incest being so fashionable , people did n't talk much about being brother and sister ; yet Jen might well weep when her brother left . <p> Shirley thought , as she rooted after a rosette thistle , of her own brother , Dodds . Dodds had been an insurance agent of thirty-five when hippies were invented , but he knew his hour when it came . He had put on a headband and gone to play drums and be communal in northern Maine . There he still was , Buddha-faced and beaded , drumming and farming , in his sixties , with five or was it six adopted children and a variable number of wives , or whatever they were . He raised potatoes and read Black Elk Speaks . Angus had called Dodds , Angus had done all that should be done , those first two days when Shirley had crouched on the floor or bed and could not talk for the great weight she bore . After she had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone in his village , with other voices faint on the crackling , roaring line , as if he were calling not only across the continent but across decades . He told Shirley to come stay on the farm as long as she liked . And she would do that . She would go be with her brother for a while . But she had to walk on the beach first , and in winter , in the dark days when you could not stand straight against the wind . <p> The thistle had tangled its tough roots with those of a rose . Out of her grave there grew a rose , and out of hers a briar . Had she done what should be done , like Angus ? She need not crouch now to know the clear dark place , the shape of it . She looked up to the porch . Jen had gone indoors . The sun was cooling down in a bank of bright fog . Warmth drained out of the day like water from a tub . I kept the vigil the night she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came . Then when I could come back out , the phone calls ; and the notice in the papers ; and the cremation and the service ; and then we came back here ; and wrote letters ; and people called ; and now . Now Angus has gone . Jen will go . Then it will all be done , wo n't it ? And I will be alone in the house . Is there something I left out ? She was sure she had omitted something , some act or obligation , but she knew also that the omission was Barbara . Barbara was what was left out , so nothing done could be complete . <p> Barbara 's daughter had gone into . the house in tears . Coward Shirley had deserted her for pigweed and thistles . She had not done what should be done . They must weep together if need be . They twined into a true lovers knot , for all men to admire . She hurried up onto the porch , beating dirt from her hands , and into the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignantly . " Judge Stevens has taken himself out of the case ? What 's his excuse ? Back spasms ? Jesus H ! " Jen 's vocabulary of expletives was curious ; probably she had got Jesus H and Jehosaphat from her father , but Lordy Dordy was , as the OED would say , of unknown origin . She said it now , skipping to another column . " Lordy Dordy ! what has happened to the Brits ? If Thatcher proposed privatizing the air would they all say Euh how ebsolyutely syupah ' and vote for it ? Privatizing water ! Jesus HI " <p> " It is a funny word , " Shirley said , much relieved by Jen 's wrath . " Barbara had to explain it to me . I mean that the private sector just means business . And then the opposite of privatize ought to be publicize , but it is n't ; what is it ? Socialize , I guess . But nothing gets socialized any more , does it ? Except little kids in preschools . " <p> " Socialism ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flapping the paper around to get at the comics . <p> Shirley appreciated the reference . Jen was a noticer , like Barbara . But not like her , not like her at all . It was comforting to see Barbara in Angus ; it was painful not to see her in Jen , to be reminded of her absence by her absence . A hole , to be talked around , not to fall into . Crouch solid , be steady , like the stone quoit , stone on earth and stone on stone , the hollow not under but within . " Wrong opposites bother me , " she said , sitting down in her chair , finding that she was stiff-legged and weary . " All the pedantry I could n't use when I was teaching takes its revenge on me . Non-opposites are even worse . When there is n't one . Like what would it be , masculism ? Hominism ? " <p> " Sounds like something you 'd get for breakfast in Alabama . " <p> " And a good thing too , " Shirley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funnies with the same aggressive intensity she brought to the front page . " Hah ! " she said once , scornful , but did not explain . <p> Since she had her long-distance glasses on , Shirley tried to read Ann Landers on the back sheet of the paper as Jen held it up only the width of Barbara 's little Bokhara away ; but she could n't quite get it into focus . It looked like one of those terrible poems that people were always , or so Ann Landers claimed , begging her to reprint , instead of something interesting , anyway . <p> " Friday , " Jen said from the city desk of a newspaper in California , only it was on the edge of a forest in the twilight , something about owls . <p> " What ? " <p> Jen was gazing at her over the downfolded newspaper with clear , piercing , light-brown eyes . Shirley was ashamed of falling asleep and could not rid herself of the owls that stared at her through Jen 's eyes . <p> " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unless you 'd like me to stay longer . Senator Bombast says I can have all next week if I want it . Or unless you want me to go sooner . I can go tomorrow . " The stare continued . <p> " No , no , " Shirley said feebly . " Whatever . " <p> " One day will be enough to clear up whatever it is you wanted to do ? " <p> " Oh , yes . Everything 's really done . Both of you being lawyers . " <p> " Mother had everything in order , " Jen said , dry . <p> " It 's only some little things . " <p> " What things ? " <p> " If you wanted them . " <p> " Everything is yours , Shirley . " <p> " The jewelry . And oh , this rug . And anything else  --  " <p> " She left it to you , " Jen said , and Shirley felt accused , not of greed , but of cowardice . <p> " You ought to have some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held out her hand . The heavy silver ring Barbara had bought her in New Mexico was twisted on her thin , large-knuckled finger ; she straightened it . " I ca n't wear her pieces . This , yes . " <p> " Sell them . " <p> " Only if you wo n't take them . I do n't want to . " <p> Jen drew in her breath and nodded . <p> " Shoes , " Shirley said . " You wear eights . " <p> Jen nodded again , morose . " I 'll look at them . " <p> " Clothes . " <p> " I 'll help you pack them up . " <p> " What for ? " <p> " The Women 's Shelter in Portland , if you have n't got somebody here you want to give them to . I 've done pro bono for them . They 're effective . " <p> Good for you ! Shirley thought , seeing Jen 's amber stare now as hawk not owl , the decisiveness of the daylight predator . <p> " Good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " <p> " Well , anything of hers you might want . It was just that I could n't do it while Angus was here . I was afraid he would think it was heartless-dividing the spoils  --  you know ? " <p> Jen shifted her angular , spare body restlessly on the sofa . " Women should do deaths , " she said . " Undertakers ought to be women . Just like midwives . Men have too many hormones and attitudes . I hated for men to touch Mother 's body . Even as little as they did . I could only bear it because they were strangers . Paid . But if we could have done it , you and me  --  that would have been right . Appropriate . But not Angus . That would n't . It should be women 's hands . " <p> Shirley was taken aback . She felt an immediate agreement with Jen 's idea , what Barbara called a visceral yes . But she did not like her saying I hated for men to touch Mother 's body  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better left unsaid , which was maybe why women should be the undertakers ; or maybe not . A vague image from Dickens was in her mind , old women around a corpse , gambling  --  for Scrooge 's bedsheets , was it ? or his winding sheets , his cerements ? Bed-curtains , dark , wrinkled , like the weathered granite , sheltering . Old women cackling , gambling , heartless , appropriate . <p> " Another thing , " Jen said , and Shirley found herself shrinking a little , the rabbit from the hawk  --  " I hated the thing in the paper . " <p> " Oh . I 'm sorry . I thought  --  " <p> " No , no , what you told them was fine . But what they did with it ! The survived by ' business  --  Survived by a son in Portland , a daughter in Salem , and two grandsons . ' Jesus HI Come on ! " <p> Shirley stalled , trying to see what was tasteless or aberrant . <p> " What about you ? " Jen demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Say what ? " <p> " Survived by her lover , Shirley Bauer . ' " <p> " Because I 'm not . I never was . " <p> Now Jen was the daylight owl , round eyes staring unfocused . <p> Shirley stood up , feeling the awful electricity gather in her veins . " I was n't her lover . She was n't my lover . I hate , we hated , we hated that-that stupid word  --  My lover ! ' " she crooned . " It does n't mean love . It only means sex , an affair , ' a liaison , it 's a dirty , sniggering , sniveling , Frenchy word . I never was Barbara 's lover . ' Spare me that ! " <p> After a pause Jen said gamely , though in a small , questioning tone , " Friend ? " <p> " Spare me the euphemisms , too , " Shirley said with some grandeur . <p> " Well , " Jen said , and found no word to say , though evidently she was running through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shirley watched her , sardonic . <p> " You see ? " she said . " There are n't any words that mean anything . For us . For any of us . We ca n't say who we are . Even men ca n't any more . Did the paper say she was survived by her ex-husband ? Or what about the man she lived with before she met your father , what 's his label ? We do n't have words for what we do ! Wife , husband , lover , ex , post , step , it 's all leftovers , words from some other civilization , nothing to do with us . Nothing means anything but the proper names . You can say Barbara was survived by Shirley . That 's all you can say . " <p> She strode around the small room , setting items straight on table and bookcase , lightning still flowing through her , buzzing in her fingertips . <p> " Daughter can mean something , " she said , snapping off a wilted chrysanthemum from the flowers Mrs. Inman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're still worth saying . Sometimes . " <p> " Mother , " Jen said , in a voice so soft and uncertain that Shirley thought for a moment Jen was addressing her , before she understood and nodded . She was wondering if Jen would add " father , " when Jen cleared her throat and spoke again : " I thought at first you were saying that you and Mother , that you were n't  --  and I thought , I 'll never forgive them ! " <p> " Why not ? " Shirley demanded , with her last unused scrap of indignation . " What 's wrong with friendship ? " <p> " Come on , " Jen said , contemptuous . " You said yourself . Anyhow , what about me ? Reading Off Our Backs and everything ? All that enlightenment wasted ? " <p> Shirley stood looking at her , and laughed . " Why , you are like her ! " <p> Jen shook her head . " Angus is . " <p> " All right , then , tell me , " Shirley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " does he , Angus , do you know what he thinks , what he thought about it , about us ? " <p> Jen went the least bit guarded . She was after all a lawyer . " He saw that Mother was happy , " she said slowly but without apparent effort to select or invent , " and that you were nice . And respectable . Respectability matters to him . " <p> " It did to Barbara . " <p> " He borrowed my Adrienne Rich . But he gave it back . He said it worried him . But you did n't . " <p> " Yes and no , maybe ? " <p> Jen did not reject the qualification . After thinking , she added , " Angus does n't seem to need to name things , the way I do . I wish I did n't , but I do . " <p> " It 's a hard habit to quit , " Shirley said , and was suddenly so tired that she had to sit down , flop down , thump down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liking she . felt for Jen puddling into sodden weariness . " Oh what shall we do for dinner , " she said wretchedly , and thin Jen said , as she feared she would say , " I 'm not hungry . " She never was . <p> At seven-thirty , after a glass of red wine , Jen fixed them bacon and eggs . <p> The next day , Thursday , they " went through " Barbara 's jewelry , shoes , clothes , and few pieces of furniture : the rug , the two carved chairs , the old typewriter and the new laptop computer , the immobile Volvo . Shirley had " gone through " her father 's and her mother 's things and knew how poor the belongings of the dead are , how little worth . She knew what Jen felt handling the odd , old , ill-kept bits of Navajo silver and Baltic amber and Florentine filigree that she had believed to be , and that had been , so long as Barbara wore them , fine and desirable . She thought of thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the granite , letting in sunlight on entangled bones , a necklace of broken amber , a twist of Cornish tin , poor gauds . She thought of the strangers in the hollow place . <p> On Friday at noon Jen left , fierce and tearful . <p> On Friday evening at last Shirley walked down Cedar Street and across Searoad to the beach , for the first walk without Barbara . Not the first alone , of course . Often each had walked alone , sometimes in a fury with the other , mostly because the other was busy or lazy or not in a walking mood . But the first walk for seven years without Barbara . <p> Her dinner was on the stove ready to be heated up . While she set it out she had drunk a small glass of the red wine Jen had opened , but she would eat after the walk , for sunset now in mid-October was about sixthirty , and she did not want to miss it . The wine helped a bit , but she had worked herself up for too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she went through the dunes . The path through them from the end of Cedar Street was almost a tunnel , the harsh dune-grass meeting overhead , then opening suddenly onto the light above the sea . A fogbank on the horizon and the long clouds lying above it were a color she had never seen in the thousand or so sunsets she had watched from this beach : a greyish mauve or lilac , dull , a heavy color , but immensely quiet and splendid between the pale green of the sky and the shining , colorless water . <p> She trudged down to the breakers , a long way , for the tide was out . Long waves ran easily up the dun sand , and running back down left a wide rippled stretch of wet that picked up the color of the sky and intensified it to a clear jade streaked with dark lilac : colors so beautiful Shirley could not take her eyes from them . She stood with her shoes sinking in the wet sand , the color all around her , and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devouring it , she craved it , even while she was thinking that they would call such a craving soft , fancy , unreal , denying that grief was a hollow that must be filled with the food that came to hand . They do n't know what people live on ! she thought . And I do n't even know who they are , she thought ; but she did know ; they were the givers of wrong names . <p> She turned , the colors sliding and shining about her on the sand , and started south . She walked only half a mile or so . Wreck Point stood grey above the moving waters ; the colors had gone without her noticing . She stood a minute looking back north . Fog was blurring out Briton Head and tangling in the dark hills above the small lights of town . Nobody was on the beach . There had been a young couple with a dog , she thought , while the colors were there , but they were gone . The light was lessening in the sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , planted on the sand , knowing who she was , the shape , crouched and hollow to hold the wind . The wind blew through her . Her feet were cold in their damp socks and wet shoes , and she was hungry . <p> <p> By URSULA K. LE GUIN <p>
