<p> Hayes Corp . filed for bankruptcy protection Friday , two years after the modem maker emerged  --  predicting dramatic growth  --  from a previous sojourn in Chapter 11 . <p> Hayes , which virtually invented the modem market , instead has been plagued by sagging sales , plummeting stock value and a dispute with preferred shareholders . Worse , suppliers have been reluctant to send the company the parts it needs to make products  --  further damaging sales . <p> Bankruptcy affords Hayes its best hope for surviving , said Chief Executive Ron Howard , who came to Hayes this year in the Hayes merger with his Maryland-based company . " This is actually a better day than many other days have been . The company is struggling to make the transition from the old Hayes to the new Hayes . " <p> Chapter 11 buys time , putting debts on hold while a company is restructured . But the company also surrenders its fate to a federal court , which can order it broken up or sold . Hayes has already slashed its work force and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayes work force has fallen in three years from more than 1,100 to about 500 . More cuts and changes are to come , Howard said . <p> The company has a deal with an institution that will lend enough money to see the company through the immediate future , Howard said , declining to name that institution . Hayes also reached agreement with two preferred shareholders that had taken them to court . Howard declined to identify those shareholders . After dropping their lawsuit , they will join the Hayes board of directors , Howard said . " Instead of having them as adversaries , they will be part of the team that will work on a turnaround . " <p> But to some , a turnaround looks like a long shot . <p> Coming out of the previous Chapter 11 , Hayes projected revenues of more than $ 300 million a year . For several quarters , revenues and earnings were strong . But then Hayes was slow to unveil a 56 kilobits-per-second modem . Moreover , the industry could n't agree on a standard for 56k modems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader U.S. Robotics . Consumers did n't want to buy slower modems , but they did n't know which version of the faster modem to choose . Profit margins were shrinking , as sales sagged  --  especially for Hayes , which did n't have the marketing muscle to shove through the confusion . <p> Hayes has forged pacts that are potentially lucrative , including a deal to make cable modems with Bay Networks . Hayes would also work with Alcatel to make devices that use copper phone lines for high-speed Internet access . <p> Hayes was once a company with $ 250 million in annual revenue selling analog modems , but past glories are gone , Howard said . " That is a legacy that I do n't really care about . It is better to be a smaller company that is profitable . " <p> But until revenue from the new technologies kicks in , Hayes still depends on sales of analog modems . <p> Patti A. Reali , analyst at Dataquest , said only 800,000 cable modems are likely to be shipped next year  --  a tiny figure compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will compete for those sales . By 2002 , analog modems , cable modems and digital subscriber lines could account for 25 percent of the market . " There 's a lot of future potential , and certainly Hayes has cut some good deals and is going in the right direction , but the question is a matter of the market . " <p> Joe Formichelli , who became chief executive of Hayes in 1996 and stayed for 20 months , also praised efforts to cut costs and cultivate new technologies . " I think what Ron has been trying to do is along the right lines . If this were a start-up company , and you went to the venture capital guy with your plans , I think you 'd get the money . " <p> However , Hayes is in a kind of wasteland between past and future , he said . " I think the team is running out of time . " <p> Blame for the company 's problems is generally laid at the feet of either Dennis Hayes or Howard  --  with partisans coming out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayes was unavailable for comment . He has been criticized for his personal style , his stubborn adherence to past practices , his lavish spending on corporate celebrations  --  whether parties during the good times or a NASCAR sponsorship more recently . But it was Hayes , then a 29-year-old engineer , who created an industry . <p> By pluck , persistence and good technology , his company became the premier manufacturer in modems . Yet the company foundered when competition grew stiffer in the early 1990s and Hayes stumbled badly , finally filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 1994 . <p> And Formichelli , who was lured to Hayes from IBM , said he can not fault Howard . He cites the company 's hesitation to cut costs , its caution in betting on new technologies . " I think it was 12 years of not moving in the right direction fast enough . Without Ron 's money , they would have been in Chapter 11 in February . " <p> Yet many are loyal to Dennis Hayes , arguing it is wrong to blame the entrepreneur who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past several years . Instead , some employees and investors lash out at Howard for his financial manipulations , for planting his own people in top Hayes positions , for an authoritarian attitude . Under Howard , the company lost a series of executives , including Jim Jones , the chief financial officer . <p> Howard has been blamed for engineering the structure of preferred stock , providing an unintended incentive for those shareholders to undermine the company 's value . The lower the stock price , the more shares they would receive if they chose to convert their holdings to common shares . <p> By " shorting " the stock , they pushed its price lower and received more common shares  --  and more control of the company . And now , two will sit on the board . <p> With the merger of Hayes and Access Beyond in December , the company went public closing at $ 12.56 1/4 a share . Friday , Hayes dipped to 18 3/4 cents a share . <p> In early 1996 , Dennis Hayes told a federal judge that as a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he would walk away with more than $ 100 million . A year ago , Hayes Corp . passed on a merger with Micronics , when Dennis Hayes apparently felt the deal placed insufficient value on his company . After all , during the bankruptcy , he turned down Diamond Multimedia 's $ 140 million bid . <p> In August , Hayes filed for the right to sell 100,000 of approximately 7.7 million shares he owns . That sale seemed to surprise Howard , who quickly moved to ban further sales by company executives . At the time , the stock was selling for $ 1.34 a share and Hayes ' holdings were worth about $ 10.318 million . At the close of business Friday , Hayes ' shares were worth $ 1.4 million .
