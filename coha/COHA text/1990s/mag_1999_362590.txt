Native Californians learn at an early age that it 's impossible to explain the place to the rest of the world , so why bother ? Nobody believes it when Californians say they do n't sit around worrying about earthquakes and mudslides ; that they do n't care when two professional football teams leave the state 's largest city inside of three months ; or that in the world capital of nutcase extremists , the guy who really seemed like an odd duck a year ago was Gray Davis , a nerdy gubernatorial candidate who claimed he would govern from the center , of all places . <P> California has the highest and lowest elevations in the Lower 48 , more rich people than anywhere else and more poor people too . Physically and cosmically , it is the fringe . So it was only natural that some natives were skeptical down to their thongs about a plodding career politician who claimed to be a moderate . But nine months into his first term , it appears that the New York City native was n't lying . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week  --  one that , among other things , expands coverage to include breast cancer and mental illnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , creates a panel to review denial of coverage and gives patients the right to sue HMOs that do n't make " the health of the patient the bottom line "  --  he established what could become a national standard by which to judge reform in this area . <P> He also capped a string of successes that required knocking heads in Sacramento and left both Democrats and Republicans crying in the aisles , wondering what happened to the mousy pencil sharpener who was long ridiculed for having the perfect first name and a series of those anonymous government jobs like lieutenant governor and controller , which are somewhat like assistant manager at the K Mart . " It was ' My way or the highway , ' " says a Democratic legislator who had run-ins with Davis early on and found out that the buttoned-up , innocuous-looking Davis could cuss like a sailor . " Sharks are gray too , are n't they ? " asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lefty Democrats whined that Davis abandoned them just when they could have steamrolled Republicans , with a majority in both houses along with the top job in the state for the first time in 16 years . Republicans carp about his grabbing headlines for initiatives set in motion by Republican predecessor Pete Wilson . Ticking off both parties while at the same time shaming them into action is the triple crown of nonpartisan , post-impeachment politics . But being in the middle is n't necessarily easy . It 's like standing on a highway median strip  --  every time you step into traffic , someone is gunning for you . <P> " I suspect voters are not looking for rigid ideology when they vote for Governors , " Davis told TIME one recent afternoon in his office , where he was meticulously reading every word of the 842 bills that sat in a box before him , often exasperating staff with brainiac questions about missing segments of earlier drafts . " They want someone who will get things done . " <P> Assault weapons and " Saturday-night special " bans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On-time budget ? Done . <P> A controversial compact with 59 California Indian tribes restoring some casino-gaming rights that had been lost in a state supreme court decision ? Done .
