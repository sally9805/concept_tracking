<p> LOS ANGELES - Come to this city for the ocean , the sun and some Hollywood glitz . Not for culture . Right ? <p> Wrong . <p> For anyone who wants to see powerful art at major museums - including such masterpieces as Thomas Gainsborough 's " Blue Boy " and Vincent van Gogh 's " Irises " - Los Angeles is the perfect choice . From Denver , which may be near some beautiful mountains but is n't a center for public collections of fine art , L.A. is a great place to go to see a lot of it fast . <p> And , because the time change works in your favor getting there , you can do it on a long weekend - three days - with some careful planning . Here 's how to see seven museums in a culture blitz : <p> On a Friday , take an early plane from DIA to LAX ( United has nonstops that arrive at 8 a.m. and 9:50 a.m. ) and a reserved rental car . You also should have a guaranteed hotel reservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waste time checking in during the day ) . <p> I strongly suggest staying in Santa Monica . The Holiday Inn is adequate , if far from luxurious , with an easy-to-use self-parking garage that does n't require long waits for <p> valet service . It 's also right across Ocean Avenue from the entrance to Santa Monica Pier , a nice place to chill out with a stroll and some snacks and games of chance after all the art . <p> I also suggest two maps : the folding , plastic Artwise Los Angeles sold at bookstores ( $ 5.95 ) and a good highway map of metropolitan Los Angeles ( you 'll need to use the freeways ) . <p> From the airport , head for the heart of downtown to the Museum of Contemporary Art , which opened in 1986 and has been pleasingly , almost surreptitiously , integrated into the California Plaza office complex . Be sure to be familiar with its parking provisions before you get there - if you park in the wrong place , you 'll barely have money left to do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had almost all of its space devoted to a fascinating retrospective of pop-art sculptor Claes Oldenburg 's work . While that now is gone , Oldenberg 's outdoor piece " Knife Ship II , " a gigantic apple-red Swiss army knife with oars poking out of its sides , is up indefinitely . It 's a landmark of L.A. contemporary art . <p> This museum always has some work from its permanent collection on display ; through Nov. 12 a show is up offering such cutting-edge names as Jean-Michel Basquait , Eric Fischl , Sherrie Levine and Cindy Sherman . <p> ( The museum has been renovating a second downtown location , the Frank Gehry-designed Temporary Contemporary , that is scheduled to open on Oct. 15 . Its first show is a big one ; " 1965-1975 : Reconsidering the Object of Art " will have one key work from that decade by many of the most important American , Canadian and European artists . ) <p> After MOCA , it 's on to the massive Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Wilshire Boulevard west of downtown . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built around a central plaza , looks much too big to cover in a day . But it 's open until 9 p.m. on Fridays , so you 'll have plenty of time . This is a good place for lunch , by the way . The Bing Center cafe is attractive and has good food . The museum has five buildings , and its permanent collection is strong in such categories as contemporary art , American art , costumes and decorative arts . The kimono collection in the Pavilion for Japanese Art also is excellent . <p> Yet , interesting as this is , L.A. County is a place to go to see big traveling shows . I caught " Gustave Caillebotte , " the much-lauded ( but now gone ) retrospective of the forgotten French impressionist . At the museum through Jan. 7 is " Frank Lloyd Wright and Japan , " which will display the Japanese objects collected by the architect . And from Nov. 5 through Jan. 21 , the museum will have " The American Discovery of Ancient Egypt . " <p> Farther out Wilshire Boulevard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open until 7 p.m. on Friday . While the UCLA-affiliated museum is part of the Occidental Petroleum cultural complex , it has a beautiful interior . A balcony connecting the galleries overlooks a courtyard where there are live-music performances , and there is an excellent art bookstore . <p> But while the collection of Daumier drawings was interesting , I found few of the displayed paintings compelling . Two exceptions were the intense pastel by Odilon Redon , " Vase of Flowers , " and James Ensor 's Matisse-like painting on a similar subject , " Flowers in the Sunlight . " Appreciators of still lifes should enjoy these . <p> Special exhibitions <p> The Hammer has fairly comprehensive special exhibitions , however . I saw the eccentric , sometimes-hallucinatory and sometimes-ugly " Pacific Dreams : Current of Surrealism and Fantasy in California Art . " <p> From here , I recommend going to Santa Monica to your hotel room . You 'll find one of the best art-related bookstores in the country , Hennessey &; Ingalls , on the Third Street Promenade . Alas , although everything else on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 6 p.m . <p> You 'll still have time on Friday to get to the Santa Monica Museum of Art ; it 's open until 10 that night . <p> It 's worth seeing just for the architecture . Gehry designed the interior to look like an expansive but rugged warehouse . It puts you off guard , as we 're used to a museum reassuring us about the worth of its objects by surrounding them with beautiful , pristine surroundings . Gehry 's building tells us we have to work to appreciate contemporary art , which is what this museum shows . <p> It has no permanent collection , but the temporary show I saw was so good I would n't want to miss this museum on any future trip . It was a terrific display of interactive conceptual art called " Action Station : Exploring Open Systems . " It 's there until Oct. 1 . <p> Head for the Huntington <p> On Saturday , start early for the wealthy enclave of San Marino , northeast of downtown . Here is my favorite L.A. fine-arts site : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 10:30 a.m . <p> Henry Huntington , a California industrialist and collector of art and rare books , left this 207-acre estate to the public . ( He died in 1927 . ) The botanical gardens are wonderful ; in particular , the desert garden and meditative Zen garden are must-sees . <p> In the Huntington Art Gallery is the important British-art collection . In the gallery of life-size portraits are " Blue Boy , " along with Sir Joshua Reynolds ' " Mrs. Siddons as the Tragic Muse , " Thomas Lawrence 's " Pinkie " and an estimable John Constable landscape , " View on the Stour Near Dedham . " A separate building houses the Virginia Steele Scott Gallery of American Art , with some excellent examples of work by Edward Hopper , Mary Cassatt , John Sloan , Frederic Church and William Merritt Chase . If this is n't enough , the library ( a separate building ) displays a Gutenberg Bible and an early manuscript of Chaucer 's " Canterbury Tales . " <p> If you want tea in the picturesque Rose Garden Room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't partake , but the fruit buffet looked ripe and extensive , and my mouth watered at all the iced tea being served . There also is a restaurant on the grounds , as well as a snack cart . <p> It 's onward now to Pasadena 's Norton Simon Museum . The late industrialist and art collector in 1974 reorganized what was once the Pasadena Art Museum , and I found some of its collections - especially the Old Master paintings , post-impressionist , cubist , expressionist and fauvist paintings - more interesting than those in L.A. County . <p> Do n't miss the galleries devoted to Degas ' delicate bronze dancers or the contemporary sculpture garden . A room displaying art from India and Southeast Asia looks out to a garden with a giant sculpture of Buddha . The Simon , too , has temporary exhibitions . Expressionist and abstract art and photographs from the Galka Scheyer collection are up until Nov. 5 . It 's open until 6 p.m. on Saturdays , and you 'll need every minute . <p> Pasadena is a surprisingly hip , busy city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants and some shops . And you still have Saturday night for bustling Santa Monica . <p> After checking out of your hotel on Sunday morning , reserve the day for the great J. Paul Getty Museum , just north of Santa Monica in Malibu along the Pacific Coast Highway . Museum admission is free , but parking is so limited that you must call and reserve a space in advance . You ca n't drive there and get in without a reservation , and the museum wo n't admit walk-ins . <p> There are , however , a couple alternatives . The Chart House restaurant , on the highway north of the museum , allows you to park in its lot on Sunday and take a cab for the short ride to the museum . ( It also runs a shuttle from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m . Tuesday-Saturday . Get there early ; the vans are crowded . ) There are other ways to take a cab or bus to the Getty and get in without a parking reservation ; call the museum for information . <p> Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worth the hassle . The museum re-creates an ancient Roman villa from the city of Herculaneum . The long , narrow pool in front of the spectacular white house is so refreshing that it 's hard to leave it for the art . <p> The Getty dates back to 1953 but did n't start its growth until the oil billionaire 's estate became the property of the Getty Trust in 1982 . It is one of the world 's most aggressive collectors . ( It just acquired two Rembrandts . ) <p> Its Greek and Roman antiquities , including " Seated Musician Flanked by Two Sirens , " are masterpiece-level , and there is room after dramatically installed room of them on the villa 's first floor . <p> The second floor has pre-20th century European art , as well as illuminated manuscripts and selections from one of the finest photography collections anywhere . <p> This is where you can stand so close to " Irises " that you 'll feel like a bug surrounded by a giant garden . Also , do n't miss Edvard Munch 's moody landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence Alma Tadema 's " Spring . " <p> From Oct. 17 to Jan. 7 , the museum will draw from its photography collection to present " Alfred Stieglitz : Seen and Unseen . " <p> Plan lunch in the Getty 's open-air cafe , where I had the best piece of chocolate cake I 've ever eaten . <p> You should have time afterward to drive up the Pacific Coast Highway to the heart of Malibu , where the historic Adamson House is right along the beach . Spanish-style , it has some of the most imaginative decorative-tile work this side of North Africa . Although it 's closed on Sunday ( open 11 a.m. -3 p.m . Wednesday-Saturday ) , you can walk around the exterior and swimming pool and peek inside the rooms anytime during daylight . <p> Since the last nonstop United flight from LAX to DIA leaves at 7:30 p.m. on Sundays ( as of this writing ) , it 's time to drive back to Santa Monica , get on the freeway for the airport and head home . <p> IF YOU VIEW THE ART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of art that a culture-seeker should n't overlook <p> Here is information about museums mentioned in the story : <p> The Museum of Contemporary Art , 250 S.
