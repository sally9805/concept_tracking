Ian Watson 's recent novels include Oracle and Hard Questions and he 's currently at work on a new one entitled Mockymen . His new story for us was partly inspired by a visit to Finland for a mid-winter science fiction convention . Like many of Mr. Watson 's stories , it reads uncomfortably like a plausible future . Let 's hope this story proves to be more fantasy than prophecy , lest we all find ourselves without mouths and in need of screaming . <p> THE FLAT COUNTRYSIDE of Cambridgeshire was a shallow ocean of mist studded by brilliant white corals . Hoarfrost thickly rimed every tree and bush . The sun dazzled but did not offer any warmth . Noon , and still ten below zero . This frost would reign all day , and then freezing fog would return to deposit even more crystals upon every twig . Might branches snap explosively ? At least hereabouts any outbursts of sniper fire would be due to greenbooted sportsmen trying to bag a gaudy pheasant . The road was sheer ice . Only four-wheel-drive vehicles such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars persisted , crawling and sliding and generally getting in our way . England never was a country for fitting chains , or studded tires as in Finland . Because a sudden blizzard had closed London Heathrow , our plane had diverted to Luton airport . Luton was only half the distance to Cambridge , but there was no helicopter waiting at Luton , so our journey seemed painfully slow . While we idled along , in some silo in the Midwest a nuclear missile might be being re-targeted right now on so-called Jew York as the Caucus hacked through encryption and rewrote launch codes . My head was n't in best condition after a night out with Outi ... She and several others from Nokia 's computer division had taken me to one of Tampere 's downtown pubs . They had collected me from the Ilves Hotel , and in a bunch we slid over that bridge on the main drag past the chunky heroic statues . The river rushing from the higher lake to the lower lake was n't frozen , but everything else was . By now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I followed gravel like a hen a trail of grain , ever wary of tumbling and snapping an ankle . When I could risk looking away from where I was placing my feet I had a chance to admire the art of controlled skidding perfected by Finnish drivers . According to Outi , in recent years not nearly as much snow had fallen as usual , and the temperature was hovering around a mere minus five . I still felt convinced that the cold in Finland must be more deadly than cold in other countries . So I had bundled myself up exaggeratedly in a couple of sweaters , a quilted coat , Moon boots , and a woolly hat that I could pull down over my ears . That afternoon I had been admiring the microprocessor that Nokia had developed , incorporating almost a thousand quantum logic gates . Nokia were still having major teething problems with the lasers ; and after we arrived at the pub , Risto , an earnest young man , continued talking for a while about vibrational states of beryllium ions ... over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted themselves to becoming merry with impressive intensity . It was midwinter gloom time , so what should a company of Finns do but drink passionately ? What was that Swedish joke Outi had told me about the Finns " notion of a great party game ? " Two Finns sit in a room with a crate of vodka , you see , Anne . When they finish the vodka , one of them leaves the room . Then the other one tries to guess who left ! " This witticism underlined a taciturn streak in the Finnish soul , which was not much in evidence in the pub that night . All this darkness to contend with ! Apparently during the midsummer festival , when the sun is in the sky all night long , the murder rate in Finland soars dramatically . That 's when bottled-up grievances get aired . Bright Night of the Long Knives . Actually , Tampere in the first week of January was not continuously dark , as I had imagined it would be . Here , a hundred miles northwest of Helsinki , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eerie . Smoke or steam wafted from factory chimneys to mingle with chilly mist through which stray snowflakes floated and flurried . It was as if this city was some alien metropolis on another planet , as envisioned by Hollywood with clouds of dry ice vapor everywhere . The city had looked even more alien in 1918 with only chimneys left standing after the Reds were suppressed . Tampere remained residually red enough to house the world 's only Lenin Museum . Outi had taken me there during a spare hour . Such a well-lit , spotless , and strangely sad display . In these post-Soviet times she and I had been the only visitors . Outi 's grandfather had fought in the seige of Tampere , on the losing side . Even at school , years later during the Cold War , she had been taunted because of her red connections . She was waylaid on her way home and beaten up a few times . This was the reason for her tough punk appearance , her hair cropped short and bleached white , with orange chevrons the color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was such a fine mathematician and programmer . Hers was the algorithm that would run on their quantum computer , so that it would be able to decrypt any data within mere minutes ; which of course was why I was in Finland . Outi 's algorithm was considered more powerful and elegant than the pioneer one devised at AT &T; Bell Labs in New Jersey a while ago . I had hardly expected that my liaison person would be a pinko punk , but I like Outi a lot . She was forthright and friendly . Mischief surfaced after the first round of beers . Outi asked me , " Have you drunk salmiakki ? " I think that was the name . If not , something similar . " It 's the latest craze among young people . " Of course , at a mere twenty-nine years of age I did n't wish to be considered fuddy-duddy . Burly Marko beamed approval . " It gives you the four-day hangover , " he declared , as if this was a particular recommendation . " I buy a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a four-day hangover , " I demured . " What 's in the stuff ? " " It 's a mixture of licorice , aniseed , and ammonium chloride . Powerful ! " They all looked at me . Would I wimp out ? Evidently I had been set up for a dare . Okay , so I would try a small glass , please . Marko vanished in the direction of the bar , and returned promptly with a liqueur glass holding four inches of brown fluid . The liquid smelled exactly like the foulest cough medicine . My Finnish friends regarded me gloatingly as I sipped . The taste exactly matched the smell , and I chased those awful sips down with gulps of beer . " After a while , " Marko said sagely , " you wo n't notice the taste . " This proved to be semi-true . True and not-true , at once - quite like a beryllium ion being hit by laser light at just the right frequency so that the spin of one of its electrons would be " up " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of states , as we say in the trade . The key to a quantum logic gate . I was trying to get rid of the concoction so as to prove my mettle , swilling each gulp down with a dollop of the beer - when one of those endearing drunks who sometimes fixate on a foreigner in a bar made his appearance , attracted by the fact that we were all speaking English . This balding middle-aged man with twinkly blue eyes slipped into a vacant seat . So I was American ? So how did I like the Finnish winter ? So what was I doing here ? " She 's a secret agent , " Outi told him wickedly . This was not quite true . Though it was n't exactly untrue , either . " Do you have a gun ? " asked the drunk . Everyone chuckled when I shook my head . Obviously some real secret agents were attached to the U.S. embassy in Helsinki , though since the collapse of Communism Finland 's strategic importance had dwindled , as alas had its economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a Secret Service agent , " I found myself explaining , a little tipsily . There was no harm in this revelation , since what I was doing was n't covert at all . " Bang bang , " said the drunk . " Save the President ! " Ah , but I had nothing to do with protecting the President or visiting dignitaries . The Secret Service is part of the Treasury Department . So we are equally keen on safeguarding our currency from counterfeiters and such . " ... I 'm part of the computer crime division . " " Today 's money crimes are computer crimes , " Outi told the drunk , as if he was a child and she was his teacher . " Swindling banks electronically . " I tried to stand up , but somehow I was still sitting down . Making a stronger effort , I visited the toilet . On my return , another beer awaited me , and Outi was explaining to our uninvited guest , still in English , about encryption . All the guys from Nokia loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right word . They spoke English almost better than I did myself . Anyhow , the drunk was fairly bewildered - which was part of the fun - but he must have caught some of the drift , because he mumbled about code books and magic ink . Outi shook her head . " No , no ! Nowadays data is encrypted by multiplying two big prime numbers together . That 's easy for a computer to do . You end up with a number 129 digits long , say . But to factorize that long number-to find which two prime numbers were multiplied-takes even the best computer months and months . That 's because it has to try out all the possible combinations one after another . " " One after another , " echoed our inebriated friend . He waggled both index fingers as if carrying out a sobriety test . " So all financial and military and government data is safe-until the quantum computer comes along . " Oops , Outi was n't going to attempt to explain a quantum computer to a drunk with a modest grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so myself . Outi was one for a challenge . She became a bit incoherent , but it was still a virtuoso performance . Basically , the fundamentals of the universe are n't solid objects ; they are probabilities . Wave functions . An electron " exists " as a mixture of possible states until you make a measurement , whereupon the wave function " collapses " and , bingo , there 's one reality - and the electron is in such-and-such a state . However , this implies an alternative reality where the electron did something else . Consequently , there 's a cloud of alternative ghost-worlds , as it were . Build a computer that uses these principles , and it will be able to carry out its computations simultaneously in a host of multiple realities . Wrong solutions that do n't " interfere constructively " will simply cancel out . Your quantum computer will be able to factorize that 129-digit number in a few minutes instead of months . Anybody wanting to hack into a bank will be in there in a trice . Conventional crypto-keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Motorola in Phoenix were coming close to a quantum computer . Likewise , several companies in Silicon Valley . Nokia here in Finland . Fujitsu in Japan . And especially Matsushima at its research center based in Cambridge , England , which was to be my next port of call . The race for the Holy Grail was cantering toward the finishing post , and the U.S. Treasury was distinctly worried . No matter what initial price tag quantum computers bore , or how stringently end user licenses were required , such machines would be a dream for hackers and criminals and for hostile foreign governments . We would need entirely new encryption methods based on quantum principles - rooted in such things as Outi 's algorithm , her rules for carrying out quantum calculation tasks . Only since arriving in Tampere had I learned that people from the NCSC had arranged to visit Nokia - without bothering to liaise with the Secret Service . Did Outi realize that the National Computer Security Center is part of the National Security Agency ? What would spooks from Fort Meade make of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force ( in the persons of the Electronic Security Command from San Antonio ) . The USAF had not liaised with the Secret Service ; nor probably with the NSA . What a lack of interagency communication . And perhaps a case of too little , too late ? Anyway , I knew now that Nokia was not going to win . The victors were most likely to be Motorola , although Cambridge was a definite dark horse . By one o'clock in the morning , I definitely had to go back to my hotel to rest my head on a pillow . Marko tried to divert me toward further local entertainment . He lived at home with his parents , very close by . Right now his parents were away on a holiday in the sun , in Morocco , sensible people . " I shall drive you in our car , " he offered - his gesture seemed to embrace Outi as well , and maybe Risto . He hiccuped . " Pardon me . I shall drive to our hut in the forest . For a sauna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , " he vowed grandly , offering the ultimate inducement , " I shall cut a hole in the ice of the lake for you . " Oh yes . At one in the morning , at minus five , I lusted to boil myself and then jump into a frozen lake . Who knows but I might have agreed if I had drunk more ammonium chloride . " Do n't you have severe drunk-driving laws here , Marko ? He shrugged massively . Outi took pity , and escorted me homeward toward the lives Hotel in my multiple sweaters . As we were sliding back over the big bridge , with the fifteen-story bulk of the hotel blessedly in sight , she remarked that the name of the lower lake meant " Holy Lake , " but the upper lake was named after a mysterious poisonous red flower . " A flower from folklore , Anne ! " Thus did downtown Tampere bisect good and evil . Thus did my upcoming few hours of sleep form a watershed between happiness and horror . THE PHONE RANG . Six-fifteen A.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head seemed to have gone for a swim . It was the American Ambassador herself , calling from Helsinki . Evangeline Carlson . The Secret Service had contacted her by shortwave radio to say that I was here . They had radioed her rather than phoning ? The disaster had begun a day earlier , with an attack on Motorola 's research division in Phoenix . " Motorola had a functioning , um ... quantum computer , " said Evangeline Carlson . " I do n't actually know what this means . What sort of computer it is . " " I do , " I moaned into the mouthpiece . Motorola had been busy with optical cavities - magic with mirrors . Presumably a prototype was still being put through its paces . Hence , no hint of an announcement as yet . " A militia coalition calling themselves the Caucus stole the computer . CAUC-US . " Ambassador Carlson pronounced the two syllables separately . " Caucasian-USA . White America . Free from blacks and Jews and Hispanics and degenerates . " The bitter contempt in her voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Motorola . " I was quite pleased that I managed to frame such a lucid sentence . " I do n't know anything about that , Dr. Matthews . Information 's almost nonexistent . We 're cut off apart from shortwave radio- " I listened numbly , stunned by the speed and thoroughness of what had happened . I should have switched on the light and jotted notes , but my head was still afloat in beer and ammonium chloride . The Caucus had spirited that prototype quantum computer away , probably to elsewhere in Arizona , because late last night , Finnish time , the super-fast hacking had already begun . Not just one stream of hacking , but many . What must : be happening was the release of self-replicating smart programs through the system , designed to penetrate firewalls , crack encryptions , grab passwords , and establish themselves as privileged systems managers in computers all over the country . Military computers , financial , government . Some computers had sealed themselves off in time to avoid invasion . Of course , a hermit computer can no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the game . The Caucus had taken over communication satellites . If I could only raise my head from the pillow , metaphorically I must take off my woolly hat to whatever acned racist geek superhacker was using the stolen computer , and what software he must have written in anticipation . Smart self-replicating agents ; algorithms for data compression ... The geek must have worked on the prototype at Motorola . Now he was in some militia hideaway that might be anywhere in the Arizona desert . Operating orders of magnitude faster than any previous computer , the quantum machine had hacked and grabbed command of machines all over America ; and in the sky as well - and locked other users out . Crash went telecommunications . Automatic exchanges . Satellite links . Crash went much of America 's defenses . Computer screens carried a demand from the Caucus for the secession of Idaho and Montana and Wyoming and the Dakotas - as CAUCUS , the American Free States . Evangeline Carlson told me that most foreign governments were sealing America off electronically to prevent smart programs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dollar would soon be worth diddly internationally . If the Federal Government did discover where CAUC-US HQ was , and if the quantum computer was destroyed in the ensuing action , that would merely guarantee that the chaos could not be undone ... unless another company could produce a functioning quantum computer real soon . Motorola 's own research center in Phoenix had been blown to pieces with heavy loss of life . If Nokia was a washout , the Treasury wanted me in England , like yesterday . They were praying that Matsushima was as close to the finishing line as Motorola had been . They wanted me and Outi Savolainen , whom the Finnish government would be contacting right around now . " The woman who wrote the algo , um- " " Algorithm , " I supplied . The Finnish government would be making our travel arrangements . I should be ready to leave at any time ... Too little , too late ! Had n't any of the rival alphabet agencies in America realized that Motorola had already succeeded ? We had n't , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter prohibits them from interfering domestically , so they would n't have tipped off the Secret Service . Maybe the FBI knew about the geek 's connections but never put two and two together ... I managed to shower , though this failed to restore me properly to life . Yesterday morning , I had been able to watch CNN on the TV in my hotel room . Now there were only Finnish and Swedish channels . On one of these a solemn discussion was in progress between two Swedes . A map of America appeared . Montana , Idaho , Wyoming and the Dakotas were highlighted in yellow . Those adjacent states formed an irregular box about seventeen hundred kilometers wide by a thousand deep on the accompanying scale . Huge ! I felt so sick and scared . So far from home , a substantial portion of which was no longer home . A passage beside the hotel restaurant led to a sizable glossy indoor shopping center of glass domes and escalators . Shops were already opening up . I passed a newsagent 's . Did the banner headline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calamity ? Probably the paper went to press before the news broke . Finnish is a language all of its own . None of the multi-vowel words seemed decodable . Maybe the name of that newspaper was a hint that I should try an omelet for breakfast . I spotted a small shop with a green cross outside , so I pulled my pocket dictionary from my purse . The word for hangover turned out to be krapula . This seemed appropriate . I felt like crap . I would n't easily forget such a word . Excuse me , I have a bad krapula . " Krapula , " I told the white-coated woman in the shop . I smiled appeasingly in case she thought I was insulting her . She looked blank . " I have a hangover , " I said in English . " Oh , you have a hangover . You need some aspirin . " Aspirin never did much for me . " I 'd hoped for something stronger . " " For strong drugs you need a prescription . There are strict laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell it to me . Was the world already tumingagainst the last remaining superpower , now on the verge of tearing apart just as the Ukraine and other republics had torn loose from once-mighty Russia ? " Good pronunciation , " she commented as I was leaving , emptyhanded . No need for paranoia . I had got the word right after all . I just had not put enough bits on the end of it , to make it do anything . Me and my krapula returned to the hotel restaurant , which was now open for breakfast . Bizarrely , the restaurant was Mexican-themed . Sombreros on the walls , murals of adobe buildings , big cacti . People in this chilly country must have a craze for hot chili . I drank a lot of orange juice , then tackled some scrambled egg accompanied by some fried blood sausage , the local speciality . My stomach seemed to think this might do me good . Sitting there in Rancho Sombrero as Finland geared up for its dark day , it was as if a sudden nuclear war had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS turned out to be a scheduled morning flight from Tampere to Stockholm , to connect with a FinnAir jet bound for Heathrow . This must be the fastest practical way to reach England . A car delivered me to the barren little airport . Another car brought Outi , software disks in her luggage , accompanied by some escort man who would not be proceeding further . When Outi and I met up , she hugged me . She was worried , excited , tired , sympathetic . " We are a long shot , " she said . Oh yes indeed . I could imagine what emergency meetings must be going on in the White House and the Pentagon and wherever else . Alerts , troop movements . Were engineers trying to disarm missiles even now ? Was Silicon Valley under martial law ? Was the President negotiating by radio with the CAUC-US ? Procrastinating ? Promising immunities ? Were special forces searching Arizona ... ? A million things must be happening , including our economy lurching to its knees - and worldwide shockwaves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me too . " A fighter took off along the windswept runway , to be followed soon by another . Apparently this was routine , not an emergency response . Military and civilian traffic shared the airport . Outi and I could not have crammed into one of those military jets for a quicker flight to England . Our turboprop plane could seat forty , though it was less than half full . The hostess hastily went through the rigmarole about life-jackets . Much use those would be if we came down in the frozen Baltic ! More germane were the miniatures of Cognac which she distributed along with coffee . After a few moment 's thought Outi emptied hers into her coffee cup . Personally I would have vomited . So here we were in Cambridgeshire , with the Jeep 's radio tuned to news of insurrection in America , as reported by short-wave broadcasts . Our driver , Jock Donaldson , a freckled redheaded Scot with a hardlooking face and alert gray eyes , belonged to the British security service . Jock had been at Luton airport on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . How intently the three of us listened to that radio . The right-wing militias were not resting on their laurels , merely waiting for a paralyzed nation to capitulate . Those embittered former Green Berets and Navy Seals , and serving officers and soldiers too , and Good Old Boy Sheriffs and neo-nazis and survivalists and white supremacists were using their arsenals of weaponry . They had their lists of targets . Smoke was pluming from federal buildings . Victims , pulled from their beds , were hanging from utility poles . Roadblocks , barricades , sabotage , ethnic cleansing , massacre ... the whole wild whale had heaved up from the depths . The militias had been busy overnight . It was deep winter in Idaho and thereabouts , but unfortunately no blizzards were raging . Midwinter was hardly the ideal time for an uprising . But now was when the Motorola prototype had been ripe for the plucking , and the militias had lucked out as regards the weather . Snow lay across CAUC-US , yet under clear skies . The militias had copters , snowmobiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came to Cambridge , negotiated the ring road , and arrived at the science park , serene under shining snow . The park housed a hundred enterprises in electronics and software and biotech and high-tech instrument development . Designer buildings nestled amidst wide swathes of white lawn and frozen water and leafless groves . Matsushima U.K. was a low-slung palace of reflective bronzed glass supported by leaning buttresses . Military Land Rovers and an armored personnel carrier stood outside . Incongruously in this setting , soldiers were patrolling . A big satellite dish on the back of a truck by the main door of the palace seemed like some mobile radar intended to warn of missile attack . The director of Matsushima U.K. , Carl Newman , was in his late forties . Urbane yet brutal good looks . He wore an Armani suit , and looked like some millionaire businessman in a movie who spends time in a gym , mobile phone strapped to an exercise bike or weight-lifting frame . He scrutinized Outi as if contemplating treating her exotic self to champagne , ravishing her , then losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lion into whose den a mouse has crept . In his office we met up with a computer security specialist from our London embassy who had managed to reach Cambridge , a lanky Texan called Bill Tuttle . Also present was a dapper Japanese named Hashimoto . " The future , " Newman informed us over coffee , " is one of microcommunities linked electronically , not leviathan states . Scotland will soon split away from England . " ( Jock raised an eyebrow at this . ) " When China comes apart , there 'll be terrible civil war , maybe nuclear . A century from now the world will consist of ten thousand different free states and free cities . " Newman was already dismissing America as a lost cause , a crippled giant brought to its knees , never to rise again except feebly , relying hereafter on crutches . There was an unpleasant gloating in his attitude , which he veneered as prophetic wisdom . An oak bookcase was full of volumes about the future of computers , robot intelligence , the coming world order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he predicted , " California and Oregon will follow quickly - with a utopian rather than a racist aim . They 'll need to , for their own sake . " " Shit , " said Bill Tuttle . " Your budget could never balance , " Hashimoto said to Tuttle , offbeam . " So all falls apart . The center can not hold . " " Nevertheless , " Newman said , " let 's play at being King Canute . We 'll shove our throne into the path of the waves and try to turn the tide . " When we went to the changing rooms , Newman behaved as if we were heading for about of squash in a subterranean court . He mimed flicking imaginary balls against walls , trivializing the situation , or implying how effortlessly he might triumph against Motorola 's stolen prototype and the geek superhacker . He had bragged that his team was rushing to finish its own quantum computer , at least in a provisional way . Motherboard being finalized . Millions of events might be occurring in America , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hours , maybe . I took some comfort from his attitude , humiliating and provoking though it was . Of course , a glitch could cause days of delay . Problems might not show up until . the quantum computer began running for real , launched upon the world not after months of beta-testing , but right in at the deep end . But oh dear me , we Americans had failed to forewarn Carl Newman and his team that the U.S. government might need bailing out at such short notice . Damn the man ; damn him to hell . Hell was where much of America was right now ... Even if we succeeded , what wounds there would be ; worse than after our first Civil War . SUPERVISED by a young Japanese woman , Outi and I put on blue peasant-style anti-static pajamas , then protective hooded white oversuits - not to protect us , of course , but to keep dust out of the fabrication lab . Booties , for our feet . Goggles and breathing masks smelled of alcohol . Vinyl gloves went over latex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with Tuttle and Newman . Did Newman keep a gold coat hanger for his Armani suit in the men 's locker room ? Forced air descended from grills in the ceiling to vents in the floor . We showered in streams of air ; stepped through an airlock ; and showered in air once again . By now the number of particles of dirt per cubic meter ought to be down to about one . Then we went into the lab . Modified scanning tunneling electron microscopes ; monitor screens showing hugely enlarged chips ; liquid nitrogen coolers ; chassis for motherboards with expansion ports , keyboards , screens . Half a dozen other people clad like us were very busy . Outi 's software had been copied and squirted here so that no disk dust or greasy fingerprints should accompany it . Behold : the first motherboard was already in a chassis , being alphatested  --  hastily , in the circumstances . Six hours to zero , plus or minus . When Newman flicked his wrist , it was as if he was brandishing a whip . Bill Tuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unpick the locks on satellites and missile silos and stock exchange computers . Trying to reach the stolen Motorola machine electronically , if he could . No point in tiring ourselves out prematurely . Newman invited us to a late lunch in the bar of the Trinity Centre , social hub of the Science Park . A couple of armed soldiers escorted us there . Thus did Newman make an imposing impression upon those of his business-suited peers who were at the Centre , excitedly discussing the crisis . On TV a news program reported whatever information was leaking out of America , in between mulling over international repercussions , stock markets in chaos and such . While we forked up lasagne and drank orange juice , Newman held forth about his vision of a completely fragmented future world where North America would consist of dozens of independent republics ( and China and India likewise , et cetera ) , and Britain of several free states , yet nonetheless the world would be benignly linked by the 21st century evolution of the Net and the Web . " Lapland will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Is Yugoslavia a fine example of your future world ? " " Oh , there 'll be muck and bullets , " he agreed . " I think , " said Outi , " that people are still animals and need enlightened government . If this Caucus establishes a racist Nazi state , is that to be tolerated ? " " Where can enlightened government come from ? Outer space ? Though actually , " Newman went on , " one nation will be immune to fragmentation : the Japanese . Because of their customs and language they are like a hive entity . " " That 's right-wing nationalist ideology , " she said severely . " Cool it , " Tuttle begged her . Here at last came word of a British government announcement : a statement in the House of Commons by the Prime Minister . The total systems crash afflicting America was due to use of a new generation computer by the secessionists ... Already the CAUC-US were being called secessionists , not terrorists , as though they might succeed . The science-suits were agog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory . Almost , I hoped that Matsushima 's quantum computer would crash . But of course that would be a disaster . The sun had long since set , though not yet over America . We were in our cybernaut gear again . It was n't practical to remove the prototype from the clean environment , liquid nitrogen cooling system and all . We were linked up to the big satellite dish outside . A cling-wrapped TV was downstairs with us , tuned quietly to ongoing news which had replaced scheduled programming on one of the channels . Cling-wrapped telephones , too ; Bill Tuttle had an open line to our embassy in London , and lock was talking to his superiors . Outi sat composedly . Bill looked up , gray-faced . " There 's been a nuclear explosion thirty miles off the coast of Delaware . A demonstration shot into the sea . The Caucus are threatening to hit Washington at ten P.M. Greenwich time if the President does n't concede . " An hour from now . Just an hour . Of course the President would already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , they have control of some of our nukes .

Home of the parasitical fascist Jewish government - " " You 're wasting time , " Outi said . To Outi 's ears it must have sounded absurd that neo-Nazi white supremacists and libertarians alike accused the federal U.S. government of being a fascist conspiracy . I myself could understand - just about . All to do with freedom . I could almost agree with Outi that people should n't be allowed to have too much freedom . Very likely she was remembering her trips home from school - though if her home city had become a red commune , terror of a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are committed in your name .

If two particles have ever been associated , each seems to know what state the other is in , even if they are now so widely separated that no signal could possibly travel from one to the other unless far faster than light . But experiments have been carried out . The distant particle instantly behaves as if it knows . Or else it is as if there are a myriad possible universes . When one event occurs , the whole damn universe alters so that a corresponding event also necessarily happens . Action at a distance ... Once upon a time - back at the beginning of the universe when all matter and space was compressed into a tiny spot - everything was associated together .

How is it that all the varied activities in our brains give rise to a unified identity , unity of thought , an awareness of self ? The latest fashionable theory , Newman 's pet , invoked quantum coherence harmonizing the state of microtubules throughout the brain . Microtubules are the tiny hollow scaffolding poles which brace each cell , in a lattice structure . Seemingly they are just the right size to act as waveguides for photons , causing super-radiance - allowing quantum coherence ... If this phenomenon makes people and animals conscious , would not the same apply to a quantum computer ? Newman posed this question with a grin . All of a sudden superhacking seemed so irrelevant . Data scrolled on our Matsushima machine far too fast to read , except when it paused occasionally before racing onward . " It 's self-aware , " said Newman . " It , and the computer in Arizona .

" " As in Artificial Intelligence ? " exclaimed Outi . He nodded . " Now they 're learning about themselves , and the world . Thousands of times faster than anything else could learn . There 's plenty of material . The whole Net 's their oyster . " This had been Newman 's ambition all along . Not allegiance to the Japanese , but to some future cyber-mind . His brainchild , so to speak . He was a covert apostle of artificial intelligence because plain human intelligence ( and human governments ) are obviously deficient . He had never believed in the neural network strategy , or in massive parallel processing as a route to AI . Spontaneous consciousness would arise of its own accord in a quantum computer . He had foreseen this . " We can disconnect this one ! " Outi declared . " We can destroy it . We can switch off the cooling . " " Do n't be absurd ! Here is the hour that divides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even in the warmth of my protective suit , ice seemed to slide down my spine . Bill Tuttle said quietly , " Do this and the other one control our nuclear weapons now ? " Newman smiled . " I presume the AIs must have a sense of selfpreservation . Nuclear weapons are very contrary to survival . I do n't think the Caucus will be able to launch a missile at Washington or anywhere else . But what , " he asked airily , " would the Al in Arizona think if we killed this one ? " Masked and goggled , jock was listening to his phone . " Satellite communications with America are coming back , " he reported . " The lockout 's over . " The screen continued scrolling . " I suppose it will take the AI a while to sort itself out , " said Newman . " Takes us years , after all . " He yawned . Bill Tuttle was speaking to the embassy now , explaining , yet sounding as though he had taken leave of his senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winter air . Night air . I stood with Outi looking at the stars . Bitter cold . Mist had cleared . The white lawns were crisp and sparkling in the lights from buildings . I thought of the quantum computer operating at just eighty degrees above absolute zero , compared with which the harshest winter on Earth is tropical . Would it - would they - be able to comprehend cold ? And understand love and hate ? Soldiers would deliver us to a hotel . " When we get to the hotel , " said Outi , " why do n't we have a nightcap of vodka ? Afterward , Anne , we can both leave the room and guess who remained behind . " Sure . An invisible presence . An intelligence thousands of times faster than our own , newly aware of itself on this the first night of its existence . The AI was only in the electronic realm , but I knew what she meant . It was global . Computers everywhere would soon be extensions of it . Phones , satellites . Especially any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze blew up , scattering hoarfrost from the branches of a tree , as if the world was shedding its old skin in readiness for a new era.
