RONALD REAGAN PLEDGED TO BALANCE THE BUDGET by 1984 . Congress , in the first , 1985 , version of the Gramm-Rudman Act , promised to wipe out the deficit by 1990 . Bill Clinton in last year 's campaign merely proposed to cut red ink in half in four years . But if his vow was more modest , it was not , apparently , any more realistic than  --  well , George Bush 's prediction three years ago of a balance by fiscal 1993 . In fact , Bush 's final budget reveals that during his Administration the deficit nearly doubled , rising to an expected $327.3 billion in fiscal 1993  --  the current year . Forecast for fiscal 1997 : $305 billion , or $68 billion more than the White House estimated only five months ago  --  and even that is based on a ludicrously optimistic assumption about what Congress will do . Chances that Clinton can fulfill his pledge : zero . <P> That should not have been a great surprise to the President-elect , since he had been hearing much the same from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealing the dismaying truth . The new figures , however , are so bad as to call into question whether Clinton can cut the deficit at all , as he still insists he will . Doing so might require not just shelving his cherished middle-class tax cut but also enacting actual tax increases and brutal cuts in some spending programs . And those could work at cross-purposes to his program to " grow the economy " by increasing investment  --  which entails new spending .
