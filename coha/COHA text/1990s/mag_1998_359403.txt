On Monday night before a rapt national audience , Bill Clinton 's first-ever public admission of having lied began with  --  a new lie . " My answers were legally accurate ... " he said of his Paula Jones testimony . <P> False . Even if you grant that his denial of " sexual relations " with Monica Lewinsky was " legally accurate " under Clinton 's baroque interpretation of the word sex , his statement in that same deposition that he did not recall ever being alone with her is flat-out false . Seven months later , he recalled very well the " inappropriate relationship . " How do you square that circle ? Claim that the improprieties occurred in the presence of others ? <P> The most poignant of all confrontations with truth is confession . Yet in his nationally televised confrontation with truth , Clinton revealed a notion of truth as endlessly self-reflecting as a fun-house mirror . It has the vertiginous feel of Epimenides ' paradox , which ( in one version ) reads , " All Cretans are liars . I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , of course , if I am a liar , I 'm lying about being a liar , and thus I 'm not . ) The lies-feeding-lies circularity is deeply disturbing . You feel you can never climb out of the box . <P> Clinton does not seem to mind . Scarier still , he does not seem to notice . He seems to really believe that his tortured legalisms , his artful dodges , his facile wordplay , his resort to idiosyncratic definitions that recall nothing so much as the " private language " of some autistic children , constitute an authentic escape from falsehood . It makes you wonder whether what appears to be Clinton 's cynicism is instead a cognitive deficit , that he has by now and by habit lost all recognition of the difference between truth and lies . <P> Truth has a purity . Truth is absolute . Even " your truth , " as the relativists would have it , has a rock-hard core : it is what you actually remember having happened . <P> When , however , words and memory are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is defined not epistemologically but politically . Days before going before the Starr grand jury , the White House was reportedly polling and floating trial balloons in the papers to determine what confession would fly . The truth is not what happened . It is what sells . And because Clinton is so good at selling , he has never needed truth as it is conventionally understood . <P> When the Lewinsky eruption occurred in January , Clinton had three choices . He could say , " I did it . I 'm sorry . " He could say , " None of your damn business . " Or he could say , " I never had sexual relations with that woman . " <P> His choice was preordained . After all , the lie in all its variations  --  the half-truth , the legalism , the critical omission , the elastic wordplay  --  is what he knows . Acrobatics  --  " I did n't inhale , " the Flowers denial , the draft  --  are what brung him to the dance . <P> Assume that Ken Starr had not amassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and including the famous dress . Assume that the Lewinsky question , like the Jones and Flowers and Kathleen Willey questions , remained an issue of he-said she-said . Does anyone doubt that Clinton would still today be sticking to his original story ?
