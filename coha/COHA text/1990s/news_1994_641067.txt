<p> It has been only two months since author Charles Murray wrote his now-famous op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal which urged the nation to end the welfare payment system . That system , Murray said , has encouraged a wave of illegitimate births , first among young black women , but more recently among whites . <p> It is well known that this nation has a serious problem with crime , with poverty , and with poor performance by children raised in single-parent families . What is not so clear is what , if anything , might be done about it . <p> President Clinton has promised to offer a reform of the welfare system , but given the complexity of fashioning such legislation and the pending fight over health care it may be months or years before that issue achieves center stage . <p> That does not mean nothing should happen in the meantime . There is a lot that could be done on the local and state level that directly affects the question of how we might make sure that a greater percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caring homes . <p> Some proposals directly address the issue of how we might re-stigmatize illegitimate births through state law , while others deal with proposed reforms concerning adoption or the process by which parental rights are terminated . Of those , more in a moment . <p> Last September , well before Murray raised his alarms about the illegitimacy rate and the emerging " white underclass , " Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders , speaking in a television interview , linked the issue of teenage mothers and crime in this dramatic form : <p> " Of the young men between the ages of 19 and 35 that are in our prison system , more than 80 percent of them were born to teenage mothers if you do n't know how to parent , you 're not likely to have the same kind of discipline for your children , you 're not likely to teach them as well , so they 're likely to get in more problems , of drugs , alcohol , homicides , suicides . They 're likely to have more trouble . " <p> Only a fool would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is alarming enough , but its impact is heightened by this one , often quoted by Murray : <p> The illegitimacy rate for black women is now over 60 percent and in some American cities has reached 80 percent . For white women it is just over 20 percent , but going up rapidly . <p> True , illegitimate births and teenage births are not the same thing , but the picture is clear enough . <p> It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that a big portion of one generation is in prison , a big portion of a second is on the way and the best the nation can hope for is to lessen the suffering of a third generation . <p> A conference last May sponsored by the Kempe National Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse featured a speech which helps to frame the issue of what might be done to reverse current trends . The speaker , a Jefferson County magistrate , outlined a provocative proposal on how society might intervene to assure that children born to teenage mothers would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The state legislature could pass a law , she said , which would create a rebuttable presumption that a teenager is an unfit parent . <p> Any teenage mother would have to appear in court to overcome the presumption by presenting evidence of her ability to raise the child , either through her own wage-earning ability , or that of a prospective husband , or more likely through the efforts of close relatives willing to share the responsibility . <p> Those mothers who were unable to make such a showing would be subject to another round of proceedings which ultimately could lead to severing parental rights . <p> The proposal has some obvious advantages and some serious drawbacks . The greatest advantage is timeliness . Instead of waiting for the first symptoms of trouble , such as a report of child abuse , signs of neglect or failure to thrive , society would be seeking early on to assure that the mother was able to care for the child . <p> In a sense , the mere proceeding should indicate a collective concern for the child 's welfare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle the responsibility , society at large would have the option to assist , either in finding another home for the child , or perhaps offering specific support . <p> There are , of course , many liberals and conservatives who recoil from the very notion of such a hearing for it interferes with a whole range of private choices which heretofore have been made without the help of government . <p> These critics would argue that society has the right to decide whether to grant aid , but only upon application . <p> If a mother walks into a welfare office and asks for money , the state may establish standards , but it has no clearly established right to summon every underage mother from the hospital down to the courthouse and inventory her emotional and physical resources . <p> Other critics , mostly conservative , could be expected to argue that if you allow the state to establish a threshold standard for motherhood that it is only a matter of time before the state would be dictating not only who would raise the child but how they would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not peddling the notion that the government should become the daddy of last resort . <p> However one feels about the notion of a presumption of parental unfitness , it does nicely illustrate society 's problem if it wishes to change the way things are currently handled . <p> Meanwhile , the battle over parental rights - even under existing laws - has reached a fever pitch in some localities . <p> Just last week in Pittsburgh , a long-simmering feud over Baby Byron reached a climax as the 18-month-old baby was taken from the home of its foster parents who were seeking the right of adoption and returned by court order to the mother who has not cared for him since birth . <p> The case is especially nasty because it contains a racial issue that simmers beneath the surface in many states , including Colorado . <p> Baby Byron 's mother is black , an admitted drug user who is enrolled in a rehabilitation program . The baby was brought into the world six weeks prematurely already addicted to both heroin and cocaine . At the age of six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster family that has been the only family he has known . Early last year the family sought to adopt the child and ran into a buzz saw of opposition . <p> Byron 's mother , to the extent that she had a child-rearing plan at all , planned to leave the child with relatives " until I was able to get him back . " The woman knows something of relying on her relatives . She has already placed one child with her mother-in-law and three others with an aunt . <p> She had planned for Byron to stay with the aunt , who at the time was living in a family grouping of 11 people crowded into just five rooms . Because the living unit was contaminated with lead , the entire group had to be housed for over two months in a community shelter . <p> The court 's determination in this matter has been cheered by members of the black community as proof that African-Americans should raise their own and that white families should not be allowed to adopt black children . <p> An equally troubling case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There a father is attempting to reassert parental rights concerning Baby Christina . <p> The issue in Arizona is whether the father , by failing to take any interest in the child for the first six months of life , abandoned the child within the meaning of the law . <p> The Children 's Legal Clinic in Denver is among those who have filed an amicus brief in the case now before the Arizona Supreme Court . The brief was submitted by Shari Shink , the center 's executive director . <p> It says , " Regular contact with a child is a fundamental indication of parental interest . The father in the instant case made little or no effort to learn the whereabouts of the child or establish contact with her . What early actions he did take were undone and even his very minimal interest wavered . <p> " Such ambivalence at so critical a time for this child refutes his ability to sustain the commitment needed to respond to the demands of the child . " <p> If lack of support , failure to visit and lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are left with a standard in which abandonment occurs only by " leaving the baby at the church door . " <p> In an interview last week , Shink added , " Kids are n't pieces of furniture to be stored somewhere and be picked up when convenient . " A lack of attention at a critical point in a child 's life is crucial and demands prompt action . <p> These cases are troublesome enough when race is not involved . They are much worse when it is . <p> It is unavoidable that there will be more cases like the one in Pittsburgh . The simple fact is that the majority of parents prepared to adopt are white , and a big proportion of those children available for adoption are black or of other minority groups . <p> Either the pool of black adoptive parents will have to be greatly enlarged or there will be more conflict . <p> In the metro area , and especially in Denver , interracial adoptions have become increasingly rare . The Denver Social Services Department frowns - to put it politely - upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preclude them . <p> Pressure from one side , as the Pittsburgh case demonstrates , produces increased pressure from the other . <p> Although several prominent black leaders have spoken out against race-based adoptions , there is a strong contingent that believes it is " wrong " to consign a black child to be raised by white parents . <p> It is unlikely there will be legislation this year to address that specific problem , but there will be legislation proposed in Colorado to limit the period in which natural parents may assert parental rights . <p> That bill deserves support , as does another that would speed up the process for placement of children under the age of 6 . <p> In theory , the placement decisions are supposed to be made within 18 months , but it is a deadline that is often violated . <p> Our juvenile court system , as any visitor can attest , is bogged down with cases and absorbed with procedure . <p> One recent example from the court files must suffice . Last week in Denver Juvenile Court , a nine-member family was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge leveled against the father by the oldest daughter . <p> The allegation is not sufficient to produce a criminal charge , but it has set in motion what may be a months-long ordeal for the family . <p> The father has agreed to leave the home , the girl will stay with relatives and the other children and the mother will await the outcome . There are hundreds of such families in various stages of being reunited . <p> What Shink and others would like to see done is to lessen the period in which these matters go unresolved . <p> Long periods of doubt and uncertainty almost always harm the child . The trick , as she admits , will be to find acceptable ways to speed up the process . <p> There are entrenched interests protecting the existing system . <p> Lawyers are all over the place , as are staffers from social services , from the probation department and , of course , from the court itself . <p> To decide the smallest matter requires assembling what amounts to a traveling road show . <p> The child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easy to feel lost . It is easy to be lost . <p> Ultimately , improvements in this area will be a tougher political challenge than even health care reform . <p> There are enormously important and conflicting interests at odds . Minorities , especially , may see the drive to reform as one that undermines their interests and even their culture . <p> It will take some very high quality political leadership to convince the nation that we are all in this together , as indeed we are .
