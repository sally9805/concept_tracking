JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY HAS HEARD OF Lucy , the diminutive , apelike superstar of human evolution . The discovery of her fossilized partial skeleton in 1974 was startling evidence that humanity 's ancestors walked the earth more than 3 million years ago , hundreds of thousands of years earlier than anyone had imagined . Since that find , paleontologists have unearthed many similar bones , some even older than Lucy 's , in the same part of Ethiopia where she was found . Most believe that all the fossils come from a single species ( scientific name : Australopithecus afarensis ) and that this species was probably the forerunner of all later hominids , including modern Homo sapiens . <P> But there has always been a band of anthropological dissidents who subscribe to a different theory . A. afarensis was not a single species , they say , but a group of loosely related species . If that is true , then there must have been an even older species , still undiscovered , that was ancestral to them all . The debate has been difficult to resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evidence : an intact A. afarensis skull . Skulls are the Rosetta stones of anthropology , bearing unique features that let scientists determine whether two fossil samples come from the same type of creature . <P> Now they have the evidence . Researchers from the Institute of Human Origins ( IHO ) in Berkeley , California , and from Tel Aviv University in Israel report in the current issue of Nature that they have discovered a nearly intact skull from a male A. afarensis who lived about 200,000 years after Lucy  --  call him Lucy 's Grandson  --  along with several arm bones from other males . The new fossils virtually clinch the view that A. afarensis is one species , placing it more firmly than ever at the root of the human family tree . And because the specimens are nearly a million years younger than the very oldest A. afarensis bones , they argue that Lucy and her relatives were an extraordinarily long-lived species . Says Alan Walker , an expert on early human anatomy at Johns Hopkins : " Everybody 's very excited about this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one species was largely based on the wide range of sizes of the specimens . Lucy , for instance , appeared to have been only about 3 ft. 6 in. tall and to have weighed 60 to 65 lbs. , while some males would have topped 5 ft. and 110 lbs . Size variations between the sexes are common among the great apes , but they are n't usually this drastic among hominids . ( Despite the extreme examples of , say , the towering Shaquille O'Neal and the tiny Dr. Ruth Westheimer , there 's only about a 5-in. difference between the average modern man and woman . ) <P> Moreover , the relatively few afarensis arm and leg bones that had been found seemed to show structural differences for different means of locomotion . The smaller females were evidently better at swinging through trees than the males , while the males appeared to be better at walking . It was hard to imagine that members of a single species could be built so differently . <P> But there were good arguments on the other side . While modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hominids did . Besides , argues William Kimbel of the IHO , principal author of the Nature report , if there really were two species , then we have just happened to find only females from one and males from the other  --  an almost inconceivable coincidence .
