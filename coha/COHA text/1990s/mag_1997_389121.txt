Romance novels these days are sensitive , amin and hotter than July // Want to heat up your summer ? Try romance . Not the kind you 'll find between the sheets but between the coversof a romance novel . If you think you wo n't enjoy that kind of fiction , think again . African-American writers of romance ( aka women 's fiction ) are shattering myths with this popular genre , writing stories of substance and relevance to Black women 's lives and also finding a new , hungry audience among sophisticated , literate women . " Many people think romance novels are trash , but I find that Black women write on a deeper level and explore real problems in our lives and communities , " says Renae Shelby , 35 , a middle-school teacher in Montgomery , Alabama , who 's been reading Black women 's fiction since the 1980 's and has a collection of nearly 70 books . Adds Danielle V. Eaddy , 30 , an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn who 's making the transition from fan to author and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Romance novels give me a chance to escape job pressures and dream of that hero I 'd like to meet one day . " These readers are among the thousands of bright , accomplished women of color whom experts believe account for about 30 percent of the $885 million spent annually on the genre , or approximately 177 million paperbacks . That 's more than 50 million romance books bought by women of color per year , which is several times the number of works by best-selling authors Terry McMillan , Connie Briscoe and E. Lynn Harris combined . And creating these books are a group of AfricanAmerican novelists determined to write about the nights and days of our lives in ways that have literally changed the face and economics of women 's fiction .

She is also an inspiration to scores of aspiring writers . As a teenage fan of the genre , however , Kitt had no role models . " All the stories I read then were gothic romances featuring White characters , " she recalls . In desperation Kitt began in the early 1980 's to write novels with Black characters . At first she wrote simply for her own enjoyment . " My idea was to create people I had n't read about before . I did not intend the first book I wrote to be a romance . I was writing what I hoped would be a very complicated contemporary novel with a strong love story as part of the plot . " To accomplish her goal , Kitt had to find time to study the craft of writing while working simultaneously as a graphic artist and librarian . Reading was her method of choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , and I probably developed a natural understanding of how a novel is paced and structured based on what holds my attention in a book , " she says . Kitt 's diligent pursuit of a writing career was rewarded when she had three novels published in 1984 , including the landmark novels Adam and Eva , which was the first Harlequin paperback by a Black writer , and All Good Things ( Doubleday ) , which is in hardcover ( most romances are paperbacks ) . Since then , her career has blossomed and come full circle . Harlequin reissued Adam and Eva last February in a special Black History Month edition . Kitt has always had a career outside writing . She is currently a collection specialist at New York 's American Museum of Natural History . In fact , it was the skill and confidence she gained in the workplace that fueled her creative energies . " I started out as a trained graphic designer and illustrator , and the creative principles are the same , " she explains . " I consider myself very visually oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easier to write . " Kitt also adheres to a consistent schedule , which she considers crucial : " I 'm up writing early in the morning for an hour or so , before heading to work . If I 'm home in the evening , I may write until midnight . " Although she primarily uses a computer these days , " I started out writing longhand , in the pre-desktop-PC days , " she says with a laugh . Kitt also manages to squeeze in writing time wherever she happens to be . " I wrote Adam and Eva while on a beach during a vacation , " she confesses . " I wrote another novel while riding the subway back and forth to work . My train ride was an hour one way , and I would always get a seat , open my pad and work on my book . " Her novels feature believable characters who mirror the complexities of African-American life . " I love exploring our differences as men and women , our vulnerabilities , our strengths , how we become sexually or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we decide to connect with that one special person , " she explains . Having covered subjects as diverse as pediatric AIDS and color consciousness among African-Americans , Kitt says , " I like to throw into the mix an exploration of social , psychological and familial issues that can hinder our attempts to form relationships . By the end of one of my books , when two people have made a commitment to each other , the reader knows the relationship is authentic . " Francis Ray Hunter pulled Erin to him with desperate urgency . She met him the same way . Heat and need too long denied flared between them . His urgent hand swept down her body , his palm cupping her hips to him . She arched into him , urging him on .... Hunter answered in the only way he could . - Incognito ( Pinnacle/Arabesque ) Before she discovered romance writers , Francis Ray had been reading popular fiction and African-American books about " the struggle .

After the third one , I knew I wanted to create similar stories of monogamous relationships with strong , sensitive men and the independent women they love . " Knowing she needed more than enthusiasm to become an author , Ray also read " anything I could get my hands on about writing . " She attended workshops and conferences and joined a writing group in which other women read and critiqued her work . When Ray sold her first book , Fallen Angel ( Odyssey Books ) , all the revisions and rewrites as well as her evening and weekend writing regimen ( which she still follows ) paid off . Writing gives balance for part-time author Ray , who works most of the year as a nurse practitioner in the Dallas public-school system , with more than 1,200 students , faculty and staff in her care .

" Before 1994 the mass-market paperback publishers were n't interested , " Ray explains . " It took the one-two-three punch of Terry McMillan , Toni Morrison and Alice Walker to wake them up to the possibility of a lucrative market . " Even so , she adds , " every month there are dozens of new romance titles on the shelves , while my publisher Arabesque , which does the most African-American romances , only accounts for four books . " Despite the explosion in the number of writers , Ray concludes , the field is wide open for those who want to get into it . " Act now and do n't put it off , " she says .

" I have always loved to read books by and about women , " she says , " but in the 1980 's I was appalled at the lack of popular fiction about Black women and strong male characters . I remember thinking at one point , If I ca n't find the kind of books I want to read , then maybe I 'll have to write them myself . " And Bunkley did just that , working on her first novel while simultaneously teaching languages in adult and middle school and raising two daughters with her husband . After the successful self-publication of Emily , The Yellow Rose , Bunkley signed a two-book hardcover publishing contract with Dutton , which has allowed her to devote all her time to her writing career .

" Where did she get the self-assurance to pursue this career ? " My background in foreign languages gave me confidence in using words to communicate an idea or image , " she explains . " When I decided to become a writer , I subscribed to Writer 's Digest , joined writers ' groups , attended conferences and read books on plot , character development and setting . " Even with this level of serious preparation and a self-published novel under her belt , there was more work in store once Bunkley began writing for a large publisher .
