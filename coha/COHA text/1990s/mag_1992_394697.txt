THE MOON CRUISES THROUGH THE UMBRA For most of us , June means the first month of observing unhindered by a variety of problems . The year 's weather has gone through adolescence into the prime of its life . Except for those of us who go to the mountains to observe , it 's finally warm at night ! Adding to our enjoyment of the season is a potentially dark partial lunar eclipse . With the exception of our friends in the frozen North , all of us in North America will see at least part of the passage of the Moon through the southern edge of Earth 's shadow on the night of June 14/15 . This event precedes by one-half lunation the total solar eclipse of June 30 , which will be observed mostly by the denizens of the South Atlantic , as the shadow touches land only in scenic Uruguay , just after sunrise . Two aspects of a lunar eclipse attract viewers year after year : the color of the light within the shadow and the relentless march of Earth 's shadow across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shadow during a lunar eclipse is caused by Earth 's atmosphere . If Earth lacked an atmosphere , the shadow 's edge would be sharp , dulled only by the effects of diffraction . In reality , however , our atmosphere refracts some of the Sun 's light into the shadow , which means that the Moon never really disappears during an eclipse . The darkness of any lunar eclipse is strongly affected by what will be going on in Earth 's atmosphere at the sunrise/sunset line around the planet . That 's the strip around Earth where the Sun 's light refracts into the shadow . If the atmosphere is filled with clouds along much of the strip , less light will get through and we 'll have a dark eclipse . If not , the eclipse will be relatively bright . Another element controls both the darkness and the color of a lunar eclipse : the amount of dust and volcanic ash in the atmosphere . The dust and ash particles are considerably larger than the wavelength of light at the blue end of the visible spectrum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the atmosphere . Light toward the red end of the spectrum has a longer wavelength and is not blocked as easily by the particles , so much more red light makes its way through the atmosphere to fill the shadow . Quite a bit of yellow light , whose wavelength is almost as long as red , gets through to fall on the Moon 's disk . Therefore , reds and yellows are the dominant colors in a lunar eclipse . To emphasize the colors of the eclipse , use the lowest power your telescope is capable of providing . Also , be sure to view the eclipsed Moon in your binoculars or finderscope . June 's lunar eclipse could be quite dark , due to the large amount of fine ash deposited in the atmosphere by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines last year . In photographing the partially eclipsed Moon , especially through your telescope , you 'll see enough light to use relatively short exposures . In fact , the built-in light meter in your camera should allow you to determine the exposure needed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a big difference in the brightness of the Moon 's surface between the part in the umbra and the part in the sunlight . So be sure to take exposures at least two stops on either side of that indicated by the meter , then one stop , and so on . Although timing the ingress of a crater into the umbra is no longer of any particular scientific value , I still find it fascinating to watch the onrushing shadow swallow up crater after crater . You may too . A RARE APPEARANCE BY MERCURY Conventional wisdom says that Mercury makes good evening apparitions only in the spring and good morning apparitions in the autumn . That 's because the ecliptic makes its biggest angle with the horizon at those times and , thus , Mercury does n't waste its meager angular displacement from the Sun by trying to stretch it along the horizon . Conventional wisdom is n't always completely correct , however , as Mercury 's evening apparition this month demonstrates . Beginning at mid-month and extending into the first week of July , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's seldom much time , so set up your telescope before sunset . Because Mercury does n't get very high in the sky , be sure to select an observing site that allows you an unobstructed view of the western horizon . Once you 've satisfied that criterion , another is to try to avoid sources of heat . They ruin the seeing . If you can , accurately align your equatorial mount the night before so you can use setting circles to aid in finding Mercury . If you 're not using setting circles , be sure to locate the point on the horizon where the Sun sets . You should be able to find Mercury by looking just east of that point thirty minutes after sunset . ( You can begin looking a bit earlier when Mercury will , of course , be a bit higher . ) One nice feature about an apparition of Mercury is that you can see as much of its full range of phases as possible in just a few weeks . So if you first find this shy planet at mid-month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to past " half-moon " in the space of three weeks . Aside from the phases , note that Mercury 's rough surface scatters much of the shorter ( blue ) wavelengths of the Sun 's light while reflecting the longer wavelengths more faithfully . We see this as Mercury 's distinctly yellowish cast . THE LAST OF OLD JOVE Jupiter was at quadrature with the Sun on May 26 and is thus high in the sky after sunset throughout June . However , this is the last month for serious observations of our largest planet , because it will be quite a bit closer to the horizon next month and almost lost in the proverbial " solar glare " in August . Plan to make Jupiter your second target after Mercury during the last half of June . Doing so will allow you to observe it while it is high in the sky and above much of the bad seeing near the horizon . Jupiter 's equatorial diameter as seen this month ranges from 36 " to 33 " . So even if your seeing is marginally good , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jupiter 's disk . The Great Red Spot is the wild card as this cyclonic storm wedges its way along the South Tropical Zone while spilling over into the South Equatorial Belt . The " movies " made from images taken by the Voyager spacecraft as they approached Jupiter in the late 1970s show the Great Red Spot gobbling up smaller dark spots and then spitting them out . Because these movies are speeded up from real time , they are quite vivid . But you can see a lot of this immense , distant storm from your own backyard . SUMMER STAR PARTY TIPS With the arrival of summer , you may get the chance to attend a star party with your astronomy club or simply a group of friends . It 's important to take careful looks through the eyepiece and think about what you 're seeing . And do n't take a short look , either : slowly drink in the view . Study the details you see in the eyepiece carefully and ask questions of the telescope owner about objects and the equipment you 're using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how different objects look through different instruments . More than anything , make sure you enjoy yourself this summer . Amateur astronomy is a relaxing , enjoyable , and stimulating way to spend your time . PLANETS IN THE EYEPIECE While June finds Mercury making a modest splash , Venus lurks so close to the Sun that it 's really not visible . Mars lies in Pisces , but its 6 " disk will show you little in the way of interesting detail . Its poor position near the horizon in the morning also argues against devoting much , if any , time to it . Saturn is finally high enough in the sky to warrant serious attention , although you 'll still have to wait until well after midnight for the ringed planet to transit the meridian . Saturn 's 17 " disk and 40 " rings make it a fine object in any telescope , and , since you 'll be observing it after midnight when the seeing can be expected to be good , you should see quite a bit . Since Saturn produced a Great White Spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in viewing not just the rings of Saturn , but also the belts and zones on the planet itself . Although they are more subtle than those observed on Jupiter , they can be very interesting . Try using a variety of filters to observe the belts and zones on Saturn . Many observers find that a blue filter makes features near the red/yellow end of the spectrum appear darker than the rest of the features , effectively enhancing contrast . You 'll find Saturn in Capricornus , where it will outshine any of that constellation 's stars . While waiting for Saturn to reach the meridian , you can also take a look at Uranus and Neptune , which may be found in eastern Sagittarius , just south and east of the 3rd-magnitude star Pi Sagittarii . ASTEROIDS IN THE EYEPIECE June finds 2 Pallas , the second asteroid to be discovered , reaching opposition on the 18th of the month .
