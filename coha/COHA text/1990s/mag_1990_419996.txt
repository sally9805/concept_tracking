It has taken years and many volunteers to change this area from a New York dump into something approaching a birder 's paradise <p> You might have mixed feelings about asking Jasper Danckaerts to come back to Jamaica Bay , a modest body of water on an edge of New York City . When he was last here , he said : " We sometimes encountered such a sweet smell in the air that we stood still " to breathe the fragrance of peach and apple blossoms . The bay , he was pleased to see , was " well provided with good creeks for . . . fisheries , " and the settlers made good use of it . Their cows fed on the marshes and so did they , going out " to shoot snipe and wild geese . " <p> If Danckaerts did come back today , after three centuries , he would find the bay surrounded by a city whose settlers have made very bad use of it . He would encounter the smell of auto fumes and garbage dumps , and see sewage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polluted bay 's crabs and flounders regularly , he could soon be certified as a toxic waste site . If he continued the journal he kept , it would tell a disheartening story of urban degradation . But he could add a sequel of restitution and redemption . <p> Multitudes of waterfowl and countless shorebirds fly over the dense metropolis to alight here . Ibises come up from the tropics to nest in summer near the subway line , and Arctic owls come down from the tundra in winter to feed at airport runways . Aromatic camphorweed sprouts from mounds of rubbish at the tidelines , and bluefish chase schools of herring into the bay to corner them in littered coves . A hawk saunters through the air , past the towered Manhattan skyline , which is draped across the horizon like a theater backdrop . <p> The bay sits just inside New York City 's most heavily populated boroughs , Brooklyn and Queens . A crow would cover some ten miles flying from the Empire State Building to the eastern shore of the bay , where , as it happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockaway peninsula separates the bay from the Atlantic Ocean , whose tides come in to flow slowly around it . It is 40 square miles of shallow water ( and many additional miles of shoreline ) , but it used to be even larger . After the Civil War , the expanding city started dumping the rubble of construction into its marshes and using the filled land to build factories and homes . Almost every inch of today 's shoreline is man-made . The bay itself was dredged to build roadways and embankments , and in a monstrous dig , 53 million cubic yards were taken up to build the John F. Kennedy International Airport ( originally known as Idlewild ) on the eastern side . Many travelers know Jamaica Bay as the last body of water their plane skims over before landing on a runway . <p> Meanwhile , neighborhood garbage dumps grew into municipal mountains . Fish oil factories and animal rendering plants filled the air with noxious smells . Sewage plants and industries flushed unfiltered wastes into the bay . It was illegal to fish commercially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad joke went , you would dissolve before you drowned . <p> By the middle of this century , the bay seemed all but hopeless  --  not dead but failing fast . Natural cleansing processes were hampered by all of the dredging , which had deepened the channels so much that by 1984 the fresh ocean waters  --  which once took two weeks to circulate around the bay  --  now took a month . One deep area left by dredgers mixed sediment and toxic heavy metals into a gunk known as " black mayonnaise . " <p> Across from the airport , sharing the bay 's miseries , sat Conchs Hole Point , a small peninsula now called Dubos Point Park . Rene Dubos , who died in 1982 , was a distinguished microbiologist ; his discoveries were crucial to the development of modern antibiotics . He was also a philosopher of the environment , an elegant thinker whose writings influenced a whole generation of ecologists and won him a Pulitzer Prize . He described himself as a " despairing optimist , " saddened by what Man had done to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for it . In workable ways , he preached , Man can restore and even improve on nature . " Think globally , " he instructed . " Act locally . " Jamaica Bay was his ecological pet , and his intervention stopped an environmentally disastrous expansion of the airport . <p> Dubos Point serves neatly as a text for its namesake 's sermons . The first thing you confront as you walk out there is an old Cadillac body resting in a thicket of goldenrod and poison ivy , with a fleet of other wrecks hiding in the brush behind it . The path is paved with chunks of old concrete , rotting wood and moldy plasterboard . Your shoes crunch on broken glass and clamshells and the skeleton of a chicken head ( the remnant , you 're told , of a voodoo rite ) , and then you come , astonished , upon a lovely bed of purple gerardia , with a buckeye butterfly feeding on a blossom , and a couple of plastic bleach containers sitting on some others . Across the water , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing . A casually kicked beer can startles a snipe out of the reeds and a great blue heron out of some wild cherry trees . A worn-out Firestone tire lies half sunk in the sand , and inside its wall a colony of periwinkles , mussels and tiny crabs have set up their own little ecosystem . Some blue crabs are slowly simmering in a battered pot over a small fire , and the cook is fishing close by . Do n't eat anything that comes out of that water , he is warned . You could get very sick . That would be a shame , he answers with a lilting Caribbean inflection , and he goes right on fishing . <p> In a world of pure justice , someone might have suggested that Dubos Point Park be renamed Bernie Blum Park . That would be a complete antithesis . Rene Dubos was urbane and cogent . Bernard J. Blum is blunt and vociferous , and his response to your telephone answering machine 's request for a brief message could be a ten-minute monologue . He is the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rene Dubos was a despairing optimist , Bernie Blum is a fulfilled Cassandra . He has an informed interest in nature and a proprietary passion for the point . More than 20 years ago , he began crying woe over what was being inflicted on it . He mapped the sites where stolen autos were being abandoned , where waste oil was being poured , and where , to his puzzlement , somebody had dropped a truckload of lawbooks , including the complete statutes of the State of New York . Otherwise-tidy neighbors were using the point for dumping their rubbish . <p> The land belonged to the city , and Bernie began a crusade to get it made into a park . He enlisted anyone who would listen to him and a great many who did n't want to  --  the community board , conservation groups , city commissioners , national park workers , city park officials , environmental task forces , local schools and the Friends of Rockaway , an organization consisting of Bernie as president and what he describes as a " tiny little following which is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for recognition and credit , Bernie saw his doleful prophecies come true . Trash begot trash , bad got worse and developers talked of building on the point . As the years passed , Bernie gained allies  --  and often lost them . Some took up the cause independently and with more practical effect . Al Appleton , a former state attorney who volunteered tirelessly for the New York City Audubon Society and has recently been made the city 's environmental commissioner , heard about the point , and in early 1984 began working on a plan with the city 's parks comissioner to make the area into a park . The Audubon Society and another conservation group , the Trust for Public Land , produced a detailed survey of Jamaica Bay 's unprotected lands . <p> What had been a cause now became a viable project . After years of maneuvering , the deal was worked out and the point was made into a park , with the Audubon Society taking care of it . Bernie did n't play much of a role in the negotiations , but in 1988 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved again . He had written the Parks Department several years earlier proposing that Conchs Hole Point be renamed Dubos Point Park . Having made the first moves , Bernie Blum now had the last word . <p> For Marc Matsil , Dubos Point Park is a battle won in a war that has not been . As director of the Division of Natural Resources in the New York City Parks Department , he helped lead the campaign for the point and now oversees it . Matsil is shrewd and dedicated and has been around . He spent two years making a census of whales and seals in the Arctic Ocean , and taking vacations in Paris as in-house playwright for a theater of the absurd . He is not easily satisfied . All around the bay are other pieces of land he aches to rescue from development . At Four Sparrows Marsh ( above ) , on the western side , some 80 acres lie right off six lanes of frantic traffic . Matsil walks in , kicking at the rubble and pushing through a jungle of mugwort , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park  --  eroded iron pipes , slimy logs , tight rows of houses hemming the water . Then , framed by the skeleton of an old barge , an egret appears , stepping delicately through the ooze . Right behind comes a smaller one . " Baby hatched here , " Matsil explains . He strides to the top of a grassy island . Before him stretches a glistening expanse of amber marsh grass and backlit water . A northern harrier glides by and an American bittern perches on a derelict boat . Matsil surveys his disheveled Eden . " Pristine , " he says , and he wants it all . But other city agencies want to sell it to builders : New York needs cash and jobs . Matsil sighs and , as he walks out to the highway , stops to break a stem off a weedy plant . A sharp fragrance springs from the crushed leaves . " Wild pepper , " he says , hope back in his voice . <p> He goes on to Fresh Creek , a couple of miles away . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a mile and a half long and some 30 yards wide , with its sources paved over . On this balmy afternoon there are some egrets on a small island , some mallards on the water , a monarch butterfly on a milkweed . The stream seems innocent of what is happening up on its banks . There , enlarging an already huge apartment complex , trucks are dumping loads of fill , and bulldozers are pushing it around . The dense clay smothers small trees . Boulders hang on the brink . Matsil stomps across the fill , torn between rage and mortal despair . <p> During the past 50 years , about half of the bay 's shore and island area has been made into parkland , much of it by bits and pieces . In 1988 the Trust for Public Land pulled off a real estate legerdemain of trade-offs and tax exemptions to get part of Motts Point for a state park . Currently the National Audubon Society is in court fighting for a few nearby acres that had been bequeathed to it and were then taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By far the biggest section of parkland is the Gateway National Recreation Area . Its base is the old Floyd Bennett Field at the southwestern corner of the bay , where , in the days of aviation pioneers , Amelia Earhart , Wiley Post and Wrong Way Corrigan took off on their historic flights . After the war the facility was deactivated , and it eventually ended up with the city 's Parks Department . That agency handed over to an amiable horticulturist named Herbert Johnson the formidable task of making the deteriorating airfield and other untidy wetlands into a nature preserve . <p> Johnson 's main qualification for the job was his experience in breeding and testing grasses for golf courses , but he set out purposefully to save the bay . He planted indigenous shrubs and trees , and enough beach grass , it was calculated , to make a walkway from the bay to Boston . Barren uplands grew into small woodlands , and eroding tidelands into protecting marshes . An enlightened piece of political builying gave Johnson a chance to make a big improvement on nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a causeway . It could do that , decided the parks commissioner ( none other than the estimable Robert Moses ) , but only if it built two freshwater ponds . The bargain was made , and around the ponds Johnson created a nature sanctuary . Birds that prefer fresh water  --  Ibises and night herons , for example , and many kinds of ducks  --  now came to the bay . Frogs , toads and turtles appreciated the new habitat . So did nature-watchers , who discovered that it was possible to walk from a subway station into a wildlife refuge . <p> In 1972 the city ceded its Jamaica Bay parklands to the National Park Service , which formed the Gateway National Recreation Area out of the bay and other wetlands around the metropolitan area . By the mid ' 70s , the bay was showing signs of recovery  --  through Johnson 's work , through environmental laws and popular pressures . The city was forced to treat its sewage wastes , and Kennedy airport was required to control runoffs of oil and fuel . Industries were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping . With commercial fishing forbidden , the bay has become once again a major breeding ground and nursery for flounder and bluefish , and its bottom supports untouched populations of crustaceans , shellfish and the microscopic organisms that are the base of aquatic food chains . The bay still may not seem an entirely wholesome environment for people , but life for some of its other inhabitants may actually be richer than it would be in purer waters . <p> The airport runways , both the idle ones at Floyd Bennett and the busy ones at Kennedy , have been a blessing to displaced birds . The constant clearing of brush and shrubs necessary to keep the runway areas open has created large stretches of grassland . Years ago grasshopper sparrows , upland sandpipers and horned larks nested in the ancient grassy plains on eastern Long Island . When housing tracts destroyed the plains , the airport grasslands were waiting to provide alternative nesting sites . At Kennedy , upland sandpipers now lay their eggs , hatch and bring up their young barely 12 inches from the runways . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or frighten the fledglings . <p> The airport has other attractions for birds . Gulls bathe and preen in pools that form on the runways when it rains . Hawks and owls come to hunt jackrabbits . When some laughing gulls built nests in Joco Marsh a few years ago , the activity was greeted as a landmark in the bay 's comeback . They had n't nested anywhere on Long Island for almost a century . But Joco Marsh is only a quarter of a mile from runway 4L at Kennedy , and the airport , seeing a threat to air traffic , is reluctantly taking steps to discourage the multiplying gull population . <p> Once there were grandiose plans to build the bay into a huge international seaport . Today , the plans forgotten , it serves as a port only for local shipping ( mostly oil barges ) and a great many private pleasure boats . It also serves as a science laboratory for Beach Channel High School , which is built on its shores . Its waters provide specimens for zoology dissections and samples for chemistry-class analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for botany and ecology courses . In their science rooms , along with tanks of eels and Fowler 's toads and pipefish , the students have a tongue-in-cheek exhibit of the bay 's unique habitat  --  crunched beer cans , a shoe circa 1900 and a 50-year-old Hennessy cognac bottle . <p> On a bright autumn Saturday , the students are out at Dubos Point . It is Cleanup Day , but before they start tidying up the place they get a botany lesson from Lou Siegel , who is head of the science department . Siegel shows them how to bend the stalk of Spartina alterniflora , uncover the seed heads and shake out the seeds ( p. 112 ) . The students scatter some of their harvest on bare pieces of beach and save the rest to plant in flats so they can set out seedlings next spring . <p> Then the class goes out to help other volunteers who have been gleaning the litter . Big plastic bags are filled with cans and bottles . Bathroom tiles pile up beside old mufflers and car springs . A long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avant-garde sculpture . The paths are neatly raked , and Conchs Hole Point begins to look and feel a little more like Dubos Point Park . <p> You can see what Dubos may eventually become by going to Gateway 's Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge , out in the middle of the water , flanking a multilane highway . This is where the freshwater ponds were built . When Herb Johnson first started working here , some 60 bird species had been counted . Now , including spring and fall migrants , summer nesters and winter residents ( and , yes , with more watchers to count them ) , the number is up to 326 species . This is one of the world 's greatest year-round birding spots , and arguably the best to be found anywhere within a city 's boundaries . <p> Oldtimers had to bushwhack through brambles and brush to get within sight of the water . Now , graveled paths lead you around the marsh , and pruned bushes give you good sight lines . But the neatness does not drive away the sense of wildness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the jet trails marking up the sky . For the many city people who come back here again and again and feel a protective affection for the bay , these intrusions only emphasize the isolated loveliness . <p> Starr Saphir comes to the refuge regularly with flocks of her birding students . A former actress and a lifelong birder , she works as a freelance naturalist and frequently conducts birding tours for Audubon . As she goes along now , she delivers an ornithological monologue . In the sumac over there at 2 o'clock is a whiteeyed vireo . What is that duck sleeping on the pond ? A green-winged teal . That statuesque figure on a log is a double-crested cormorant airing its outspread wings . Starr stops and gives a loud pissh-pissh . A golden-crowned kinglet answers with a soft teee-teee-teee . <p> While the group sits down beside one of the ponds to tally the day 's score  --  47 sightings and a song sparrow heard but not seen  --  you go across the highway toward the other pond . The shore is beyond a row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and you follow , thinking she will guide you to a break in the barrier . She does , but though the duck goes through , it is too low for you to manage . As you walk across a field of sedge , you look down , and underfoot are patches of a wild orchid  --  nodding ladies ' tresses , with their tiny white flowers spiraling up a still stem . You pick your way carefully  --  nobody steps on an orchid . <p> At a wooden blind the pond opens like a child 's pop-up picture book . Northern shovelers feeding on duckweed float with their heads submerged and their rumps tipped up . Mute swans rest near a flock of brant . In a cove , six black ducks share a log with five turtles , while a belted kingfisher perches on an owl box nearby . A flock of snow geese come up off the water , black tips etched on their wings . The air seems syncopated as some herring gulls , flying with steady four-four wingbeats , cross a line of cormorants flapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brants purr , the kingfisher rattles . A subway train comes clattering across the tracks at the back of the pond , but just then some noisy Canada geese fly by and you do n't hear the train at all . <p> By Joseph Kastner <p> <p> Joseph Kastner is the author of " A World of Watchers , " a history of birding .
