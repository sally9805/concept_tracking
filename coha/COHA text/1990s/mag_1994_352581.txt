adoption "  --  but not with the cash that might keep mother and child together . Orphanages were not the subject of Gingrich 's speech , but they were not a throwaway either . The notion reappeared in the Republican welfare-reform bill ( with the inflammatory word orphanages changed to " children 's homes " ) , which is a basis for Gingrich 's famous " Contract with America . " <P> It was not a smart move . The news media were quick to note the orphanage proposal 's obvious incompatibility with " family values . " Hillary Clinton told a New York audience last week that the " idea of putting children into orphanages because their mothers could n't find jobs " was " unbelievable and absurd . " Eager to be seen as the way of the future , the Newtonians found themselves tarred with images of the distant , Dickensian past . <P> Many Republicans were loath even to repeat the dread word . So it was left to a lowly House staff member who handles welfare policy for the Republican conference to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphanage option ? " If they were , they have buttoned their lips . This thing has been mercilessly crucified , " he says . " I would not be surprised if they strike the provision from the bill , because it 's given us so much grief . " <P> Nearly everyone agrees that illegitimacy and teen pregnancy are key elements in poverty 's vicious cycle and that the government should try to reduce them . Gingrich 's orphanage proposal , however , seems punitive  --  not to mention odd , coming from a man who was born to a 16-year-old mother eight months after she left his abusive father . It would violate federal law , which mandates family- based care over institutions , and ignore the public policy consensus  --  first expressed by the Teddy Roosevelt White House  --  that " no child should be deprived of his family by reason of poverty alone . " <P> It would also be a budget buster . According to an analysis done for TIME by the Child Welfare League of America , the annual welfare cost of one child living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child living with a foster family costs the public $4,800 a year . The average cost for the child 's care in " residential group care , " today 's closest approximation of an orphanage , is $36,500 . If even a quarter of an estimated 1 million children who would be cut loose under Gingrich 's plan ended up in orphanages , the additional cost to &; the public would be more than $8 billion . <P> That said , however , Gingrich perhaps inadvertently stumbled into a contentious ongoing debate among child-welfare experts about " congregate care . " The wrangle is not about whether half a million mothers who may love their children should be forced to give them up to institutions . It is about the half a million children already in the system , whose parents are either dead or have proved themselves abusive or negligent , and whether orphanages should be used to supplement foster placements that do n't work out . " Orphanages " proper have been out of vogue for so long that it is hard today to locate a building with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but growing number of social scientists and social-welfare professionals has been advocating their return . And in so doing , they have broached a disturbing question : Have America 's attempts to find families for its abandoned and damaged children failed so badly that some institutionalization looks good ?
