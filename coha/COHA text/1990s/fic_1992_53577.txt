Margaret Many Wounds was dying . Three years earlier she had been diagnosed as diabetic , and now , although she felt her health rapidly declining , she refused to go to the hospital . <p> " I am old anyway , " she told her relatives . " Leave me be . " <p> Early one morning she called to her daughter : " Let me have a mirror . " Lydia fetched her mother a compact mirror , removing the powder puff before she placed it in her hands . Margaret thanked Lydia and fluttered her fingers to wave her daughter away . <p> Margaret peered at her reflection , moving the compact in a circle so she could see her entire face . She thought she looked transparent as baby crayfish in the Little Heart River . Margaret had never been a vain woman , one to consult each mirror she passed or smooth her hair as she caught her reflection in a storefront window . She simply wanted to make certain she was still there , still flesh and sweet blood and silver hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't be sure . She felt herself floating beneath the covers , held down by sweat and three-star quilts . She could n't eat anymore . Tender meat was like gristle , dinner rolls like gravel and the sunflower seeds Margaret had once craved hard as cherry pits . But she requested a bowl of wastunkala , Sioux corn soup . It had been a staple on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation where Margaret lived , but was now a delicacy as it required extensive preparation . Margaret 's twin daughters were busy in the kitchen , fixing what might prove to be their mother 's last supper . Evie soaked dried corn in water while Lydia cut venison into strips . <p> Evie poked her head into her mother 's bedroom . " Will you be able to eat it once it 's made ? " she asked . <p> " The broth will slide down my gullet just easy , " Margaret said , stroking her throat with emaciated fingers as if to demonstrate . <p> " It 'll be a while , " Evie told her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broth simmer for most of the next day . <p> " I know , " said Margaret . <p> Evie was impatient . She wanted to serve it now and see her mother 's dark brown eyes shine , flash once again with amber sparks . This is just typical , Evie thought . She believed reservation life was out of balance , a place where everything that was trivial took an inordinate amount of time while the momentous things occurred with obscene rapidity . It 's why I left all those years ago , she told herself . And why I never came back . Until now . <p> " What ? " Margaret asked . She snapped the compact shut and placed it on her bedside table . <p> " Nothing . " Evie returned to the kitchen , the central area of Margaret 's small cabin . <p> " And do n't you let that Father Zimmer near me ! " Margaret called after her daughter . " All he wants to do is have the last word over my body , and go fishing for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Father Zimmer 's faithful . But in past weeks , bedridden and preoccupied with mortality , she had withdrawn from him . <p> " I 'm not a sheep , " she 'd ranted late at night when everyone else was asleep . " There 's still time to go back . " Margaret had recovered an old faith from her youth , from the days when there was magic , before the concept of sin had washed over Sioux people as the Oahe Dam had flooded their reservation with stagnant water . <p> I have been defeated by guilt , Margaret decided . That is when she had her grandson , Harley , bury her cedar rosary in the dirt yard . " Maybe something useful will grow , " she told him . She took to praying to Wakan Tanka , the Great Spirit of her childhood who had not been a jealous God , she thought , but had waited patiently for her to honor Him again . <p> " Mama 's sure down on the old padre , " Evie said . Lydia nodded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'd think at a time like this she 'd want to hold onto him for comfort , " Evie continued . Lydia shrugged her shoulders . <p> " Well , I wo n't let him in . " Evie would n't push Catholicism on her mother . She did n't like what she considered the powerlessness of faith , preferring the safety of a world she could see with her own eyes . <p> " I wonder where Philbert 's taken off to , " Evie said . Her husband , Philbert , had left early that morning in their dented Chew . <p> " I 'm off to rediscover warrior country , " he 'd told her , blowing Evie a kiss as he backed out of the cabin . <p> " He 's probably discovered a six-pack and some no-good buddies , " Evie said . <p> Moments later she heard a car door slam in the yard , and her missing husband , chewing Spearmint gum to mask his beery breath , burst into the kitchen and caught Evie around the waist in a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thoughts . <p> Evie had n't looked back after leaving Standing Rock and moving to Minneapolis seven years earlier . " You look back , you never get off the res , " she told Philbert when he complained of being homesick . But Lydia 's short note  --  Please come , Mama 's dying  --  roused her . <p> Philbert and Evie drove from Minneapolis to Fort Yates , North Dakota , in a day , their trunk full of groceries they bought in Bismark . It was July 17 , 1969 , and all the way from Minneapolis they listened to news programs covering the Apollo 11 mission to the moon . Astronauts Nell Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin were due to land ' on the moon in three days . <p> " It 's gon na be a miracle , " Philbert had said at the conclusion of each special report . Upon hearing it for the umpteenth time , Evie glared at him . He was oblivious . He steered the car with his elbows , leaving his hands free to mop sweat from his forehead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that air conditioning , " he complained . He stuck his head out of the window to catch a breeze but was whipped by sandy grit . <p> Evie thought Philbert looked like a bug . More like a bug each year with his long skinny arms and legs , loose as tentacles , and stunted round torso . His head was shaved in a buzz cut because he was lazy and did n't like to comb his hair . Philbert was thirty years old , five years older than Evie , and currently retired . At the peak of his rodeo career as a champion bull rider he 'd been stepped on . The bull 's hoof left a small V-shaped scar directly over his heart , and even though several doctors had declared him healthy , he said his heart could n't take it . " It wo n't let me do this anymore , " he told Evie when she urged him to ride again . <p> Evie had no patience with Philbert 's heart but she did n't argue . She worked full time as a secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she returned home at night . She supposed there were women in America who would chide her for such slavish devotion , but she knew something they did n't ; she had never loved him . She had been drawn to him because he was a successful bull rider , because he was bowlegged and uncomfortable without his dusty cowboy hat jammed tightly on his head . In short , she was attracted to him because he matched perfectly the image of her father she 'd developed in a cloud of ignorance . Spoiling Philbert was Evie 's way of apologizing for her lack of sentiment . <p> During the tedious drive from Minneapolis , Evie had time to anticipate her reunion with Lydia . The endless comparisons she 'd once made between them had tapered off in the years they were apart , but Erie found herself resurrecting the habit as her husband fiddled with the car radio . <p> Lydia had always been the good daughter , sweet-tempered and incurious , never dreaming of taking flight . And Evie was n't beautiful like Lydia . Her nose was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared when she smiled . Her hair was dry and frizzy from too many perms and she wore black-framed glasses attached to a beaded daisy chain around her neck , removing them in order to read . But she had won Philbert because she inherited what he called her mother 's magnetism , a term Evie hated . <p> All her life Evie had envied her sister 's beauty and placid nature . Right up until Lydia 's husband and son were killed in a car accident . Lydia was pregnant with Harley at the time , and Evie believed his existence was what kept Lydia alive . As it was , she had seen her sister give up pieces of herself , including her voice . Lydia had n't spoken a word since the accident , although she did sing at powwows . <p> People said she had the voice of a ghost . When Lydia sang , women would carry their tape recorders to the drum to record her , and men would soften their voices to let Lydia 's rise , above the dancers ' heads , above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the atmosphere to that dark place where the air is thin and Wanagi Tacanku , the Spirit Road , begins . <p> When Evie and Philbert finally pulled up in front of Margaret 's cabin , five-year-old Harley was playing in the dirt yard , arranging pebbles and abandoned keys in elaborate patterns . He watched solemnly as his aunt and uncle stepped out of the car . <p> " Grandma is dying , " he said in a voice surprisingly deep and hoarse . <p> " I know , " Evie said , moving past him to enter the house . Philbert remained behind to meet the nephew he 'd seen only in photographs . <p> Margaret 's cabin was whitewashed and clean , but bare . There had been a dirt floor when Evie and Lydia were growing up , but now there were planks covered with red-speckled linoleum . There were two large rooms and an outhouse in back . Lydia had placed cornflowers on the kitchen table and was cooking wozapi , a berry pudding , when her sister entered . <p> Evie thought that perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greet her , but instead she calmly set aside her mixing spoon and gave Evie a quick hug . <p> " Good to see you , " Evie whispered . Lydia nodded and retrieved her spoon . <p> Evie looked in on her mother , who was so pale she was almost white . She is n't dying , she 's fading , thought Evie . <p> When Margaret saw Evie , she said , " My girl , " and waved a creamy hand . <p> Mama looks like a white woman , Evie thought as she sat down on the edge of Margaret 's bed . <p> " You were always my favorite , " Margaret whispered to her daughter . <p> " No , Mama , this is Evelyn , " Evie said in a loud voice . <p> " That 's right . I know it . " <p> Mama is confused , Evie decided . <p> " My girl , I 've missed you . " Margaret held Evie 's hand . " I have just a few things to give away so let me tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a set of books including the complete works of Jane Austen should be given to Harley in ten years , on his fifteenth birthday . Lydia was to have her mother 's wedding moccasins , which had only been worn the one time . They were exquisitely beaded : a background of white cut beads framing beaded crimson roses . Evie was to have a gold locket she never knew her mother owned . Margaret pulled it from beneath her nightgown . The gold case was big as her thumb , with the monogram MMM . Evie wondered what was inside but did n't ask . <p> For the next couple of days the sisters looked after their mother together and spent hours at the kitchen table playing gin rummy . Evie no longer enjoyed the game . When she was little all she wanted to do was beat Lydia , even if it meant cheating , hiding unmatched cards beneath sets she spread like a fan and set down with a flourish . Lydia never seemed to suspect Evie 's string of wins , but played round after round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any moment . <p> Evie no longer cheated but found herself winning just as regularly . It was too easy . Lydia gave up the cards Evie needed time and again , and even when she passed them up to help Lydia win , inevitably the card she drew from the deck was equally valuable . She could n't lose . But Evie continued to play because the game made Lydia 's silence less oppressive . As children they had played quietly . Each knew where the other wanted to go , what she wanted to do , with one glance . Evie realized that the present suspension of speech was different , uninformed , but she found it comforting , anyway . It was the way they had always played cards . <p> Two days after her prodigal daughter returned , Margaret had requested the last bowl of corn soup . It was good to hear the girls moving together in the kitchen . The soup would n't be ready until the next day , but already Margaret could taste it , could feel the warm broth in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their own little house a half mile down the gravel road . Evie and Philbert made pallets on the kitchen floor , and Margaret could hear them whispering in the dark for a while . <p> Margaret tried to sleep , but she heard scuffling feet and smothered giggles at the foot of her bed . She saw people crowding her bedroom . They were sitting on little wooden chairs , facing her bed , waiting like an audience . She started to ask them who they were but caught herself just in time . It would be rude . Sioux hospitality required that she welcome all visitors . <p> " Do you want me to tell you the story ? " Margaret asked the dark figures . " It 's been in my head for so many days now . " They all nodded . Margaret closed her eyes and pressed her hands together . She began to speak : <p> " Charles Bad-Holy MacLeod returned to the reservation in 1912 when I was seventeen . He came back from the Indian School in Carlisle , Pennsylvania , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He came back with twenty books and a head full of education . He came back lonely and ignorant . He looked like a full-blood despite the way he 'd parted his short hair straight down the middle , but he did n't remember one story about Fort Yates or his own tribe . He did n't remember one honor song . <p> " We worked a trade to educate one another . He read to me until eventually I learned to make out the words . Our favorite book was Pride and Prejudice . I liked that little white girl , Elizabeth Bennet , because she had wit and a backbone . I thought she would have made a good Sioux . In return I told him all the stories and legends about where he came from . I taught him many songs . We liked the warrior ones best because they were so conceited . We would laugh when we sang the chores : I have arrived , the battle will soon be over . I even took him to the Grand River one night so he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief 's son who was a winkte  --  a man who loves other men  --  mourning the loss of a lover killed fighting the Arikara . You could still hear him singing where his people had camped along the river . <p> " I wanted to reclaim Charles Bad-Holy MacLeod for the tribe and for myself . I pitied him because the reservation agent had taken him away at age four and let Pennsylvania keep him until he was twenty-one . I was grateful my parents had kept me so well-hidden in the brush of Angry Butte , guarded by sunka Sapa , Black Dog , each time the agent came around . sunka Sapa would have eaten the agent 's scrawny throat before letting him take me . But we always had the last laugh because those Indians taken away to Carlisle would return to the reservation and make up for lost time . They would become the most fanatical traditionals . Even Charles would have given up his white man 's suit and learned to dance again if he 'd been with me long enough . <p> " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shocked him . On our wedding night I undressed in the lamplight , folding each garment as it was removed , placing it on the back of a chair . I unbraided my hair and used it to wash my breasts . My mother would have been disgusted because I was so immodest . But I did it because the part in my husband 's hair looked like a straight white road , the kind I would never travel . His body was brown and I was relieved . I though.t the tight clothes might have pinched him white , leeched the color right out of his cells . I had to undo all those buttons and release him because he could n't move . <p> " I had the two best years of my life then . Charles did the accounting for a shopkeeper who did n't mind admitting he could n't figure numbers and an Indian could . We were delighted with one another . My mother thought we were too delighted . She wanted to know when she could expect a grandchild . It 's funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were together . Maybe if I 'd had the son or daughter of Charles Bad-Holy MacLeod I would have managed better when he died of tuberculosis . I would n't have left so much of myself in his coffin . " <p> Margaret 's voice had awakened Evie and Philbert . They listened , transfixed , to a story they had never heard . <p> " Why is she doing this ? Who 's she talking to ? " Evie asked . <p> " She 's telling her life , " Philbert explained . " Probably just trying to let it go . " <p> " It is n't fair , " Evie whispered angrily . " I begged her to tell me things when I was little , family history , all kinds of stuff . And she would just laugh . Tell me I had to find my own answers in the world . " <p> Evie was crying . Philbert had never known Evie to cry before and he did n't know what to do . He wrapped an ann around her and pulled her close , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the hard floor beneath them . <p> " I guess people change when they see death coming , " Philbert told his wife . She was suddenly quiet , her weeping ended . Philbert believed she had fallen asleep when he heard her sigh . <p> " I wonder what those astronauts are doing , " she said . <p> In the morning Margaret waited for the sun to light her room , expecting to see the faces of her audience . But the figures and chairs were gone . Margaret heard a cough and looked towards the window . There they were , clustered around her cabin and peering in , whole families with children perched on their fathers ' shoulders . She could n't make out who they were . <p> " It 's pretty hot for so early in the morning , " Margaret said . The crowd nodded and she saw a flash of white hankies drawn across moist faces . <p> I will finish the story , Margaret thought . <p> " In seventy-four years I had just two men . One was big passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you think ? To have passion and understanding ? <p> " I was forty-nine years old in 1944 when I came to be working in Bismark . They called me a nurse , but I 'd had no training , just a willingness to work with prisoners of war . About a thousand of them were in the Bismark camp . <p> " I worked with Dr. Sei-ichi Sakuma , a surgeon from San Francisco . He 'd volunteered to work at the camp after his wife died of food poisoning in Manzanar . Dr. Sakuma had brought his own surgical instruments with him and they were superior to any in the camp . ! thought those instruments were beautiful and terrible . They fit nicely in my hand ; the weight of them was just right . I handled them efficiently in assisting the doctor . He would tell me about his wife as he worked . How she wrote limericks and how she loved to jitterbug . Her name was Evelyn . I remember her as someone I knew , although we never met . Dr. Sakuma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched me closely . ' I never knew Indians before , ' he said . <p> " In our loneliness we became lovers . ' I thought I would never want anyone again . It has been thirty years , ' I told him . But we did n't talk about it much . There was n't time . There was n't space , either , so we had to use the medical supply room to have any privacy . Dr. Sakuma had thin hair and wore wire-rimmed spectacles that pinched his nose . He was strong , but the bones in his face looked delicate . When I kissed him I was gentle . <p> " My mother never told me you could do it standing up . We had no choice because the medical supply room was so small . Three feet by three feet , but most of the shelves were bare , so we could spread our hands across the wood , pressing for balance . We smelled like rubbing alcohol and had to swallow sounds to keep our secret . It became a test of will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless , but horribly silent . <p> " It sounds vulgar , but there was n't a vulgar thing about it . Mostly we needed someone to hold onto , reassurance that we were alive and warm under the skin . For me , it was a thaw . <p> " I did n't worry about getting pregnant . I guess I thought I was an old lady . Then I dreamt one night that I had swallowed two marbles and could feel them in the pit of my stomach . They were talking inside me like little chatterboxes . ' Quiet , be still , ' I scolded . Later I realized they were my twin girls talking to me in a dream . <p> " From the day I discovered I was pregnant I avoided the camp . I called the medical director to resign and never returned . This is a sin I have n't wanted to admit . I left Dr. Sakuma with no explanations , knowing he could n't leave the camp to find me . When the war ended I thought maybe he might try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You know , I 've asked myself so many times why I did this . Maybe I was worried my girls would be teased because their mother went to bed with The Enemy . Maybe I was afraid people would call them ' breeds . ' Maybe I was afraid Dr. Sakuma would reject me once he found out . <p> " After Lydia and Evelyn were born I returned to Fort Yates with a big lie about marrying a Canadian Indian who left me . That lie made me a member of the church and my daughters full-blood Indians . But it has never tasted right , and maybe that 's why I ca n't eat the food my daughters bring me . Maybe the higher powers are scolding me , telling me to let the lie nourish me as I have nourished it . But it 's time for the lies to perish , do n't you think ? " <p> Evie was stunned and too angry to cry . She was glad she alone had overheard Margaret 's confession . Lydia and Harley had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by a flock of wild turkeys . Evie could n't bear to look at her mother . She imagined she would see the words strung out across the room , suspended above her mother 's bed . <p> Margaret had told her daughters their father was a Blood Indian from Calgary . A champion rodeo rider who had won the All-Around title in North Dakota the year Margaret was forty-nine and starting to get an itch . He had been ten years younger but crazy in love , taking Margaret back to Canada when he returned , where they married . Eventually he 'd left her , and she made her way back to Fort Yates to have Evie and Lydia . <p> That was the legend . That was Evie 's understanding of her own history . Margaret had kept his name secret , ostensibly to prevent the girls from trying to trace their father . The family name they used was Many Wounds , Margaret 's maiden name . But Evie had come up with her father 's name . In a dream she had seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphantly in the air . She could n't see him clearly because the bull leapt and twisted , but she heard his name called by the emcee . " The best ride of the day ! Let 's hear it for Sonny Porter ! " <p> All her life Evie had been the daughter of Sonny Porter . She 'd married Philbert because he rode the Brahma bulls so much the way her father had . Evie had even called the Calgary operator once , asking if there was a listing for Sonny Porter . She 'd had no luck but imagined he could be anywhere . <p> At eight years old she 'd drawn a picture of him with the silver All-Around trophy in his hand . His face was empty of features except for a great crescent smile traced above his chin . <p> She believed her father was passionate and adventurous . I take after him , she had told herself over the years , and the idea pleased her . <p> A hot breeze moved through the kitchen , and Evie held onto the kitchen table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She had composed herself by the time Philbert returned from his walk . She focused her attention on the simmering corn soup and a stream of radio reports on the moon landing . <p> Philbert had brought the television set from Lydia 's place to Margaret 's cabin . He placed it on her low bureau so she could watch it from the bed . <p> " What 's he doing ? " Margaret asked Evie . <p> " The astronauts are landing on the moon today . We thought you 'd like to watch it , Mama . " <p> " I 've been there , " she told Evie . She watched Philbert struggle to reach the outlet behind her dresser . <p> " What do you mean ? " Evie asked , irritated by her mother 's remark . <p> " When I was little , my Tunkasila , my grandfather , woke me up in the middle of the night . I was about your age , " she told Harley , who stood directly behind Philbert . <p> " He carried me on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his waist . He showed me the moon , told me I could go there if I wanted to bad enough . And for just one second I really was there , looking back at the spinning earth , bright as a blue eye . " <p> " Oh , " Evie said . Years ago she would have treasured this anecdote , but it had come too late for her to enjoy or believe . <p> Philbert brought in kitchen chairs for Evie and Lydia to sit on while they waited for the astronauts to emerge from their lunar module . <p> Margaret paid no attention to the broadcast . <p> " Takoja , come sit with me . " Harley sat on the bed with his grandmother . She stroked the back of his head . <p> " Someday when you 're grown up you should liberate my grandmother 's dress , " she told him . <p> " Mama , we can tell him about the dress later . Do n't you want to see the men walking on the moon ? " <p> Margaret waved her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are they going to put on a show ? " <p> " Yes , " said Evie , and Philbert stared at her . " Never mind , " she told him . <p> " My grandmother 's dress was the most beautiful and unusual dress people had ever seen . It took her years to finish beading the top of it , from the collar , over the sleeves , down to the waist . The background was blue beads , and she beaded buffalo and Sioux warriors on horseback running through the sky ; pictures of their spirits because so many of them were dead . She only wore it to the most sacred ceremonies , and when she danced at the edge of the dancers ' circle , she said she was dancing them back to life . " <p> Harley could imagine a buffalo hunt in the sky . He pulled back his right arm and aimed an invisible arrow at the space module settled in lunar dust . <p> " Okay , it 's any minute now . Look , Mama , the astronauts are getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for her mother to see . She looked to Lydia for support but her sister stared straight ahead at the television . <p> " Someone got hold of that dress after Grandma died , and now it 's in the Field Museum in Chicago . The Plains Indian section . I was in Chicago just once , years ago , and that was the only thing I wanted to see . I stood there all day practically , trying to figure out how I could get that dress back . " <p> Harley took his grandmother 's hand and gave her the rusty skeleton key he 'd found in the yard . " I ' 11 get it for you someday , " he told her , slipping out of bed to stand beside his mother 's chair . <p> Evie was desperate for the astronauts to leave their vehicle and walk on the moon . She wanted to see it happen and know it was real ; a scientific miracle worked out with equations . " It will be history , " she said aloud . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skeleton key in her palm like she was trying to find a way out of her skin . <p> Evie and Lydia were making fry bread , waiting for the corn soup to cool enough to serve their mother . Philbert sat at the kitchen table eating the bread as quickly as it was made . <p> " Save some for Mama , " Erie scolded . <p> She was in a sour mood . Her mother had been totally unimpressed by the shots of men walking on the moon . Evie had left the bedroom disappointed , convinced that Margaret was so ill she could n't understand the significance of what had just occurred . <p> Even Lydia seemed unaffected , kneading the dough as efficiently as ever . She 's getting more like Mama all the time , Evie thought . <p> Harley alone remained behind to entertain his grandmother . He saw there were two moons in the world : one on television and one in the sky outside his grandmother 's window . <p> " Two moons , " he told Margaret , curling his thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " More than that , " Margaret told him , " many , many more . For every person who can see it , there 's another one . " <p> Harley ducked his head . The idea filled all the skies he could imagine , and all the rooms , and the spaces between trees , until moons like opaque marbles tumbled out of heaven to roll in a spectacular avalanche down the buttes . <p> " That way everyone has a moon of their own . " <p> Harley extended his arm so his hand neatly blotted the moon outside the window . He was bending his fingers to encircle its white image , wanting to cup it in his left palm . <p> " Mine will be a yo-yo , " he told Margaret as he tried to pluck it out of the sky . <p> " Takoja , come here . I will show you the moon . " <p> Harley turned away from the window and stood beside Margaret 's bed , She told him to close his eyes and pretend . She would pretend right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of his head . It merged with bone and popped his ears . He felt an expansion , then an adjustment . Harley stood before his grandmother with the moon in his skull , eyes pouring cool light onto her quilt-covered body . Stellar wind rushed through the passages of his ears , wave upon wave like the undulating roar of a conch shell . <p> Harley could read his grandmother 's lips but could n't hear her . She was saying , " That is the moon . That is the way into the moon . " <p> He shook his head because he did n't understand . So she pointed to the television screen where the men walked in a floating manner that was both heavy and light . <p> " They can only walk on the surface , " Margaret mouthed . <p> Harley could n't think . His mind was squeezed , crushed close behind his eyes . The moon left him so suddenly , he fell onto the bed . His small arms slammed across Margaret 's legs , making them twitch and shudder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " Margaret told him . " It 'll be all right . But remember that feeling . Remember what it 's like to be the moon , and you , and the darkness and the light . " Her hand moved in a circle . <p> Margaret Many Wounds decided to die early ; before a last taste of wastunkala , before kissing her family goodbye , before Father Zimmer performed the Last Rites to purify her Everlasting Soul . She needed the extra time to work her own magic . <p> Do you have faith ? she asked herself . She nodded and slipped into the water . It had been coursing around her bed for two days , parting at Evie 's feet , lapping against Harley 's sneakers , and splashing hot spray onto Margaret 's face . But the water was cool now . She did n't need to breathe , and she was conscious of movement . I am moving , she thought , but she could n't say in which direction . I am I , she thought with relief . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a light without color . She was alone . She could n't feel her body , but it was still there , she could see it from the outside . <p> She was wearing her grandmother 's dress with matching leggings and moccasins . The beads were brighter than she remembered ; each bead sparkled , dazzling as a sun . I remember the sun , she thought . A single eagle feather was pinned to the back of her head , tilted at an angle to the right . Her belt was silver conches on black leather with a trailer falling to her ankles , silver at its tip . Three sets of dentalium shell earrings dangled from her ears , set in holes an inch apart moving up her earlobes . Her hair was plaited in two thick braids , weighted at the ends with hair ties made of bullets and bones . She tried to guess her own age but it was useless . ! am beautiful , she thought . <p> She looked out from her body . A figure stood before her . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit . <p> " I 've been waiting for you , " he told her . <p> " I 'm glad to see you again , " she answered , confused because her joy was so calm . " They let you dress like that ? " Margaret had immediately noticed that his high collar , now a burning , blue-hot white , still bit into his throat . <p> " I was accustomed to it , " he explained . <p> " I left Fort Yates early , " Margaret told him , and Charles nodded . " I have one last thing I want to do . " <p> " That 's acceptable to us , " he said , and for a moment Margaret thought she heard the others . " Do what you have to and then join us at the council fire . " <p> " How will I find the council fire ? " Margaret wished she could go there directly , eager to learn what the ancestors already knew . <p> " Follow Wanagi Tacanku to its very end . It wo n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe you will see us by the fire . Push across the border . Five steps will bring you to us . " <p> " Mama , your soup is ready . " Evie brought the wastunkala into her mother 's room . <p> " She 's not there , " Harley said . He was sitting at the foot of his grandmother 's bed , watching the television screen . <p> " Of course she 's there , " Evie snapped . The soup spilled a little and burned her hand . " Shoot . " Evie placed the bowl on the bedside table , cooling her hand with her tongue . " Wake up , Mama , it 's what you 've been waiting for . " <p> Margaret 's body was warm , but Evie knew when she clutched her mother 's shoulder that she was dead . Evie felt naked and afraid . " Can you see me ? " she asked . " I ca n't see you . Maybe I 'll never see you again . " Evie sat beside her mother , holding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braid and brought it to her nose . The scent was baby shampoo Lydia used to wash Margaret 's hair . She kissed her mother 's lips . <p> Evie did n't cry until she fished Margaret 's locket from beneath her nightgown . It opened with a snap , and Evie had to clean the tiny photographs with her pinkie finger to remove the lint . Charles Bad-Holy MacLeod was on one side , his black hair parted severely down the middle and slicked back on either side . A high collar choked him , and his eyes burned with intelligence . The other photo was of a balding , middle-aged Japanese gentleman . His smile was nothing but pain , his teeth hidden behind stretched lips . Evie recognized the smile and the gentle eyes . The expression was Lydia 's . <p> Everyone had forgotten Harley . He dragged the cane-bottom chair in front of the television set and knelt on its seat . His hands rested on the bureau as he watched the black-mirrored surface of Neil Armstrong 's face mask . <p> Behind him Evie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap and gentlest strokes . They washed her hair and spread it on the pillow to dry . It ran over the edges like a spill of white ribbons . Lydia painted Margaret 's face the old way ; she dabbed crimson lipstick on her forefinger and ran it down the part of her mother 's hair . She drew a large circle above each cheekbone , then filled them in . Lydia removed the old nail polish and put on a fresh clear coat . Then she and Evie dressed Margaret in the silky buckskin dress she had worn to powwows , wrapping her in a dance shawl quilted with a thunderbird design on the back . <p> You will fly with powerful wings , Lydia was thinking . <p> You will never dance again , Evie thought . <p> They dressed Margaret in the wedding moccasins she had willed to Lydia . The soles were still clean on the bottom , and the sisters were startled when the slippers were in place because it looked like roses grew from the arch of each foot . <p> Father Zimmer sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was inconsolable . Philbert stood across from him , hands plunged deep in his pockets , jingling change . Philbert thought the priest was going to cry . <p> " I should have been here to ease the passage , " Father Zimmer said , stirring his coffee with a spoon , though he 'd added nothing to it . The rising steam was like the vapor of souls . He cried to think that Margaret 's soul would hang over the buttes like fog because she had died without his blessing . He did n't want her to be caught between Here and There . <p> " I will say a mass for her , " he said , and Philbert bowed his head . <p> Harley 's knees were beginning to ache , but he continued to kneel on the chair . As he listened , the voices of Walter Cronkite , the astronauts , and Ground Control at Cape Canaveral were sucked away . He heard the Sioux Flag Song pounding from the black vent on the television set , but when Harley checked over his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin were facing the camera , and Harley smiled because they reminded him of two white turtles standing upright . Armstrong was using an aluminum scoop fitted into an extension handle to collect samples of rock without bending over . Aldrin was using a set of tongs to pick up larger pieces . <p> Somewhere inside the music , Harley heard a familiar voice calling , " Tak6ja . " <p> Harley was no longer lonely or invisible on the chair . He saw his grandmother 's figure emerging on the screen , dancing towards him from the far horizon behind the astronauts . He recognized her weaving dance as Sioux powwow steps , but her beautiful blue-beaded dress was unfamiliar to him . <p> At first he thought , Grandma is young . But then she smiled at him , and the smile was old . Her hair was black , and her hair was white . Her progress was steady , and he noticed she did n't bounce like the men in space suits . <p> He waited for Armstrong and Aldrin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . Finally she came upon them , and Harley caught his breath because Margaret danced through Neil Armstrong . The astronaut never ceased digging at the ground , leaving footprints like heavy tank treads , but his oxygen system quivered a little as she passed . <p> Margaret Many Wounds was dancing on the moon . Look at the crooked tracks ! make like a snake , she thought . At first it seemed the circuit she was making would take a long time . Am I dancing orflying ? she wondered when instead it happened very quickly . <p> Names came to her , though she had never learned them . That is the Sea of Crises , she knew , and that is the Sea of Serenity . She crossed the Sea of Fertility and then backtracked to the Sea of Tranquility . That was where she felt Harley 's presence . <p> Takoja , she called with her spirit . Look at me , look at the magic . There is still magic in the world . <p> Margaret danced beyond the astronauts and their stiff metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of her trail in the gritty Lake of Dreams . She raised a foot and found Wanagi Tacanku , the Spirit Road , rippling beneath her feet . She set off , no longer dancing , walking towards the council fire five steps beyond the edge of the universe . <p> <p> By Susan Power <p> Susan Power is a Native American ( Yanktonai Sioux ) , originally from Chicago .
