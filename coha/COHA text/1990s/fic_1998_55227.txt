We never can find their fuckin ' houses . <p> We get a set of shit directions there , a different set of shit directions back . OK , we 've got an attitude about the goddamn load no matter what we 're told it is  --  grand , baby , standup , damaged , used , good used , or good  --  fifth or first floor , basement , attic , narrow or wide staircase  --  the kit or the whole coffin  --  it 's the same to us . <p> We carry it out into the light beyond the lighted , decorated , dimwit room we rearrange , rip , gouge , and nick all we want on our way out . Make way , we say , make way  --  words that give us rights greater any day than the owners ' , am I right ? <p> Some are widows , widowers , divorcees or divorcers , retiring or retired . They are not as sensitive as you would think . We 're hauling off something they wanted bad or still want , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . They stall out , clamp up , they stutter those fucked witty things we never get or ever got . <p> What makes us us and them not us ? What makes them them and us not them ? They were politely chewing when we were swallowing hard . That 's how they were , that 's how they are . They learned putting together when we were learning pulling apart . <p> So fucking what ? So , fucking what ? So-fucking-what . <p> We amputate the legs , mummify the sound and the keyboards in blankets , rope , and tape , and cart the thing to freedom , taking no educated guesses about how the damned load has gotten in there , how the fuck it will get out , how many hours we 'll take making way and making way and making way . You do this job long enough and you ca n't think of anything good to say about the people who own pianos , with their walk-in closets and their screened-in porches , their Eurostyle custom kitchens , wet bars , hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scar scars that bandaged monster we bump against the plaster or wallpaper . We make the walls drum , the floors groan . We strike the chandeliers and bronze standing lamps , strum the dumb , leggy houseplants these people hang in jute from their ceilings . <p> Fuck yeah , they 're the people who macrame and refurbish and antique  --  or would , or have that look like they might . They might , they might , they might , they say , and never have to speak it , do they ? Whatever they want , they only have to say they want it once . <p> I love them . <p> I love the people who own pianos decorated with some shredded pieces of lace or crochet they want to tell you the story of . I hate their stories about some other piano in some foreign country someone fled for some reason that has to be recited , for some reason , and ca n't just be said . I hate their sad , ugly mugs , but I love them , and I tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why I 'm here  --  to ease your pain at Your Time of Loss . See , I brought my best crew of compassionate men . They love you too . They do . Right , guys ? Hourly employees . Hourly they love you . ( OK , all right , I do n't say any of that to the people who own pianos . You ca n't say that shit to them . ) <p> If they want , they can talk . God , they can talk . They can . You can listen . One time , this guy says to the crew  --  and the crew was all parked on his couch because he told us to  --  he made us  --  he was about to fuckin ' cry  --  he called us " Boys "  --  he said , " Boys , our dog has gone to prison , boys . For life . " <p> A strange thing to hear from an old guy sitting alone at his worthless standup piano with no " our " in sight , one chair at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who probably meant " our son , " " our grandson , " or " our minister " has gone to prison , but could n't have meant the dog unless it was another dog than the humming , haunted-looking , balding red hound dog cowering like a convict or ex-con against the piano pedals and chewing on a rubber dollbaby that kept its eyes and mouth shut , its arms and legs straight out . <p> " Boys , " the old man said , " I was a piano mover "  --  gray boogers floating in both his eyes . " Can you believe it ? " <p> Fuck no , we thought . Fuck no , I said . Oh , hell , I did n't really say it , I could n't , but I must 've almost did because he made a snorting sound and said , " Fuck yes . " <p> The people who own pianos are never people who moved them . He couldn't 've been the player . It couldn't 've been his piano . <p> " Get off my bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might 've been a foldout or something , how do you know , because their couches are n't always couches , and their groomed , good-looking dogs are more like blue or yellow budgies in sparkling wire cages . He couldn't 've been the owner . It couldn't 've been his dog . <p> " Our dog was the one who played , " he said . Probably meant " our daughter , " " our granddaughter , " " our ghost , " " our god " played this monster . We got up anyway . We petted his dog , named after that prick Judge Bork . It was on his tags . " Hey , get this , " we said to the old guy who could n't have got it , owned it , named it . " Bork , " we said . " Bork ! " Bork never moved , never stretched , yawned , scratched , twitched . Just chewed on the doll 's eight toes and hummed and made the old man 's same snoring sound . " Fetch , " we said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music and sofa pillows and shit like that at Bork 's head , with no results . <p> But the old man . The old man on his piano bench flinched , bent , and all of a sudden he thumped the closed key-cover and said , like it meant something , " Piss on it . " He meant on it all , the whole thing , piano , piano makers , buyers , sellers , players , movers , traders , and the entire damn unjust prison system , but at first we thought he wanted us to lift our legs and piss on his dog , and we looked at Bork like he was a fire hydrant , and he might 've been , he might 've been , he was that red and that immovable and stupid . <p> He said " Piss on it " again , which we did n't . He said , " Do you know who I am ? " which we did n't . He said , " Of course not , " and shook his head . <p> I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love is like that , you know . <p> We took the piano , took the couch , the table ; took the one chair , the one glass , the magazines and sheet music . We took the rubber dollbaby . The last thing we did was shovel Bork onto the piano cart and roll him out like the royal dog he was or the genie or dragon or troll who played the old man 's piano really well before he did a life sentence and died and came back as a red dog . Make way , make way , we said . And the old man did . <p> Hell , we are different , to be honest . So-fucking-what . So fucking what ? They never cuss . We cuss . They tell the truths that lie ; we tell the lies that lie , and that 's the truth . The people who own pianos never share the stories they are most ashamed to share , and that 's no lie . That 's how they are , that 's how they were . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were learning rest when we were learning restless . Oh , fuck yeah , sometimes we have to put the damned thing on the floor or the stairs . Or we get as far as the front yard , and lay it down there that loving way you lay down a tire you just busted off a rim . We rest our backs or heads on the hard pillow , the hard , lost island of overambitious , undertalented piano-bangers , the hard , silent coffin you could fit three little Mozarts and their wigs inside . We slap the black giant on its ass or pet its smooth , hard chest , or we make a guess at middle C and play muffled " Chopsticks " through the ropes and tape and blankets . What ? Did you think we never knew people who knew the people who played pianos ? <p> Well , we did . <p> And all the people who own pianos stare at us through their clean front windows or lean out their solid walnut doors or stand on but not beyond the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like our cussing , laughing , or our doll we call " Sleeping Ugly " asleep on the dash , dreaming of an open mouth and open eyes ; dreaming of two more toes , of chewing on the dog to show him what it 's like ; dreaming of some clothes , for God 's sake , to cover her genitals , and some cash to cover her ass on the short fall into trouble and the long climb out of it ; dreaming of a halfway house or a hospital room or a cardboard box on a steel steam grate ; dreaming of toothaches and nosebleeds and rubber or  --  why not ?  --  real scabs , and nails to pick the scabs ; and dreaming of prescription drugs and sex toys and sleeplessness  --  fabulous fucking sleeplessness . And teeth . And a tongue  --  and the spit to go with it . And bile . And blockage and gas and life-size shit , and no bitchy sisters and no goddamn prince . Dreaming of leaving home with a mean red dog and criminal friends in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van . <p> ( OK , OK , she 's not dreaming of any of that . Probably not . Probably not . So-fucking-what . So , fucking what ? Soooooo fuuuuuucking what ? ) <p> They do n't like us . <p> They do n't like our dog 's erotic dancing , and they hate the applause when we applaud ourselves . They do n't like our need to know the kind of happiness they knew before they needed something else . <p> <p> By KEVIN McILVOY <p>
