These are trying days on American campuses . Faced with the double dilemma of a shrinking student population and rising costs , colleges and universities across the country are simultaneously rattling tin cups and wielding budget axes . One result : sharp cutbacks in programs and services . " The 1990s , " says Cornell University President Frank H.T. Rhodes , " are going to be very tough . " <P> He should know . Last week Cornell announced plans to seek $1.25 billion in private donations by 1995  --  the largest fund-raising target in the history of American higher education . Cornell 's drive is but the latest in a series of efforts to acquire huge sums for colleges and universities . Last month Columbia set a new five-year goal of $1.15 billion . Yale will embark on a $1 billion-plus campaign sometime in the next 18 months , and Harvard is said to be considering a target as high as $2 billion . <P> As they dun alumni and other donors for funds , schools are also pinching pennies , sometimes in dramatic fashion . Bryn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anthropology . Lehigh has eliminated its classics department , while Northwestern has cut its nursing and dental hygiene programs . Columbia , which earlier abandoned its linguistics and geography departments , announced in June that it would follow the University of Chicago 's lead and shut down its library science school . Dartmouth has cut 55 staffers and eliminated seven junior varsity sports , including men 's tennis , lacrosse , soccer and golf . <P> Some colleges are hiring strategic planners ; others are contracting out janitorial services . Stanford recently decided to form a new management % company , complete with a nonacademic CEO , to handle its finances and investments . Harvard , Duke and Princeton already have similar organizations . Last spring Franklin &; Marshall College sold its bookstore to a private company , netting the school $900,000 and saving it the burden of carrying unsold inventory . " This is not a onetime adjustment , " says Lehigh President Peter Likins . " It 's going to be a way of life . " <P> Post-secondary institutions are feeling both an economic and a demographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilt , schools can no longer expect robust returns on their endowments , so they are struggling to refurbish their capital . Meantime , the days of bulging classrooms are long gone . The 1965-75 baby bust led to a 10% dip in the number of college-age students in the 1980s ; the head count will plummet a further 25% by the mid-1990s . The ability of institutions to simply crank up tuition and fees has also hit a ceiling . Last spring Princeton scaled back a projected 6.9% hike in tuition , room and board to 6.7% , leaving a still daunting annual bill per student of $20,498 . " We used to view tuition as a tithe paid by grateful parishioners , " says Northwestern President Arnold Weber . " Now there clearly is price resistance . "
