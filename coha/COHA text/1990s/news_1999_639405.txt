<p> The two teams have cursed each other , punched each other , taunted each other , hated each other . And that was even before Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe extolled the merits of Chiefs linebacker Derrick Thomas ' girlfriend to his face . <p> Fair to say , the Chiefs like the Broncos about as much as Boston likes baseball umpires . The Broncos do n't feel a lot different about the Chiefs . But if the Broncos can save their world and their season today in New England , Denver owes a debt of gratitude to none other than Kansas City . <p> The Chiefs inadvertently provided the Broncos with the formula for beating the Patriots . <p> Two Sundays ago , the Chiefs did everything the Broncos must do today if Denver wants to come out of Foxboro , Mass. , alive and kicking . The Chiefs rushed the ball , rushed quarterback Drew Bledsoe and rushed to a 16-14 victory . Denver 's surest shot today is to follow the formula Chiefs coach Gunther Cunningham helped cook up . <p> Cunningham knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches do , just as everyone in football does . When Bledsoe has his way , so do the Patriots . <p> In the Patriots ' four wins , Bledsoe has had a quarterback rating of no less than 96.3 . In the Patriots ' two losses , Bledsoe 's highest quarterback rating was 71.9 . In the Patriots ' four wins , Bledsoe completed no fewer than 60 percent of his passes . In the Patriots ' two losses , Bledsoe completed no more than 51 percent of his passes . <p> So , the Chiefs got after Bledsoe . Kansas City sacked Bledsoe three times and knocked him down 10 more . The knockdowns , not the sacks , were key . They affected Bledsoe , mentally and physically . Twice he had receivers wide open downfield . Twice he missed them . The Chiefs had gotten to him , and gotten inside his head . <p> ' We wanted to keep somebody in his face at all times , ' Chiefs safety Jerome Woods said , explaining his team 's strategy after Kansas City handed New England its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everybody , so he was n't able to see his target . ' <p> The Dolphins did a similar thing last Sunday , mimicking the Chiefs before the Broncos could . They got after Bledsoe , and the Patriots were forced to keep in seven blockers to help control the Dolphins ' pass rush . It did n't work . Miami hurried Bledsoe into a season-low 46 percent completion percentage . His quarterback rating was 63.5 . New England , not surprisingly , lost . <p> There is a trend , there is a blueprint , and it is right there , on the game film of Kansas City 's victory over New England that Denver looked at last week . The Broncos ' coaches know just what they have to do . Now it 's up to their players to implement it . <p> Denver was able to come up with one defensive masterpiece against the NFC 's top quarterback , Brett Favre . ' We rattled Favre , ' Broncos defensive tackle Mike Lodish said moments after Denver 's 31-10 win over Green Bay . ' Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was just serving it up . ' <p> Now they must come up with another defensive masterpiece against the AFC 's top quarterback , Bledsoe . But hail the Chiefs . The Broncos know it can be done , and they know how it should be done . Control the ball , control Bledsoe , control the game . <p> THE AFC <p> Seahawks wide receiver Joey Galloway 's fine total is up to more than $ 973,000 - and counting . Galloway has been fined $ 5,000 per day for a holdout that reached 83 days on Thursday . He has missed the first six weeks of the season , at $ 93,000 per week . And he even has lost the proposed $ 7 million signing bonus the Seahawks initially offered . Does n't sound like Galloway wants to play for Seattle again . But to get out of the final year of his contract , and become the free agent he wants to be , Galloway must play six games this season <p> Southern California 's 28-27 loss to Notre Dame two Saturdays back was a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one losing bet , Seau had to wear San Diego guard Aaron Taylor 's Notre Dame jersey around the Chargers ' training complex , which was ugly enough . But then there was his hair . To pay off another bet to kicker John Carney , Seau had to dye his normally black hair Irish gold , and it was a dye job not exactly to die for <p> Shortly after San Diego beat Seattle to take sole possession of first place in the AFC West , somebody informed Chargers coach Mike Riley that Denver had blown out Green Bay . His mood instantly changed . Sensing the Broncos are not quite as finished as one national publication would lead you to believe , Riley muttered , ' Why did they have to do that ? ' Even Seahawks running back Ricky Watters knows how close this AFC West race could be . ' We 've said all along this division was going to come down to the wire , ' Watters said <p> With Denver 's Terrell Davis and Atlanta 's Jamal Anderson out for the season , Oakland defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the NFL 's finest . ' Best running back in the league , ' Harris said about Wheatley . ' Easy . He might not have the most yards because our offense is n't like that . But pound for pound , he 's done more for us than any other back in the league . ' Would be hard to argue , too . The Raiders ' rushing offense is No. 1 in the NFL <p> Privately , it has been said that Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart locks in on one receiver , and that he is playing with subpar wide receivers and offensive linemen . Last week , Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan said it publicly . Stewart and the Steelers must be pretty bad if Buchanan is willing to blast them before he has to go head-to-head with them Monday night <p> The only quarterback the Browns selected in the expansion draft was Scott Milanovich , whom the team cut in May . Bad choice . Most know by now that they passed on St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner . But they also passed on Jacksonville quarterback Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and led the Jaguars to victory over Cleveland <p> One thing that would help the Jaguars ' offense would be if wide receiver Jimmy Smith could hold on to the ball . In six games he has eight drops - seven more than he had all last season . The Browns have their own problems . As a team they keep dropping the ball . They have taken a lead into halftime in their past three games but still have been outscored 32-2 in the second half <p> Beginning one week from today , when they play back-to-back games against St. Louis and Miami , we 'll begin to learn how good and real the Titans are . So far , excluding their win over expansion Cleveland , the Titans four other wins have come by a total of eight points over teams that are a combined 9-13 <p> One more reason the Bengals are the worst-run organization in football : In 1996 , the Bengals elected to keep quarterback Kerry Joseph - who now plays safety for the Seahawks - over University of Washington free-agent quarterback Damon Huard . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beat the Patriots <p> The Dolphins might have found themselves a running back in Cecil Collins . But if he does n't come through , they 've certainly limited their options . In recent months , the Dolphins have either cut or traded Karim Abdul-Jabbar , John Avery , Bernie Parmalee and Wheatley . <p> THE NFC <p> The Vikings , who visit Mile High Stadium one week from today , have been the NFL 's most mismanaged team during the past year . First they signed quarterback Randall Cunningham to a five-year , $ 28 million contract extension , and now he 's on the bench . Then , they traded quarterback Brad Johnson to the Washington Redskins for a first-round pick they used on Central Florida quarterback Daunte Culpepper , who is years away from being ready . And now they 're starting quarterback Jeff George <p> Nobody throws a nicer ball than George , but no quarterback is as much of a career loser . George 's record as a starting quarterback is 37-70 . After the Vikings signed George , who is notorious for putting himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager said : ' If he winds up helping them over the long term , the entire league will be shocked . It 's not the arm with George . It 's his attitude . ' <p> One guy who is tough is Vikings running back Leroy Hoard . After biting through his lip last Sunday , he had three makeshift stitches sewn in his mouth without taking any painkillers . Then , after playing more football , Hoard had to have those three stitches removed and 13 regular ones put in . Ouch <p> The Vikings ' starting quarterback of choice last Sunday , Randall Cunningham , lost . But on the same day , three former Vikings quarterbacks - Oakland 's Rich Gannon , Washington 's Brad Johnson and Jacksonville 's Jay Fiedler - all won <p> When the 49ers and Vikings square off today , the game will feature the top two touchdown reception leaders in NFL history , neither of whom is the player he has been . 49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice has 166 career touchdown catches and Vikings wide receiver Cris Carter has 103 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' I do n't see any reason I ca n't rush for at least 100 yards a game . ' How ' bout in one game ? Williams still has yet to crack the century mark this season <p> Instead of grabbing his crotch , maybe Saints coach Mike Ditka should just grab his throat . The Saints have blown fourth-quarter leads in their past four games . ' The Bible tells you that God does n't give you more than you can take , and I 'm starting to wonder about that right now , ' Ditka admitted <p> Turns out Ditka 's wife , Diana , is as feisty as her husband . On Oct. 18 , the day Iron Mike turned 60 , Diana Ditka remarked : ' Never been to bed with a 60-year-old man . I 'm going to get him a Viagra cake . ' <p> Hamstring problems have hobbled Rams receiver Issac Bruce the past two seasons . But this season , Bruce is healthy , and has 494 receiving yards - 37 more than he had all last season . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training camp , proclaiming , ' When I 'm well , I 'm hell . ' <p> Nobody is more depressed about the Chargers ' good start than the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . During the 1998 draft , Chargers general manager Bobby Beathard traded his first-round pick in 2000 to Tampa Bay for a second-round choice that he used on wide receiver Mikhael Ricks . <p> We have a winner in the injury of the year . Buccaneers defensive end John McLaughlin could not practice Wednesday . During Tampa Bay 's bye week , he got a sunburn on his forehead that was so severe , he could not get his helmet on his head <p> By the middle of last week , when Green Bay was supposed to be getting ready for San Diego , Packers coach Ray Rhodes was mumbling about getting blown out in Denver . ' How does it feel when you get somebody to put a size 12 up your rear end ? ' Rhodes said . ' You tell me how it feels . That 's how it feels when you 're getting drilled like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but clearly more losses are ahead . Since Papa Bear George Halas ' on-again , off-again coaching tenure ended after the 1967 season , the Bears have hired seven head coaches , including current coach Dick Jauron . None of the previous six , including Ditka , ever posted a winning record in his first year on the job . @p#
