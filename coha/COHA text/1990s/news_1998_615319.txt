<p> No school system , even one as tiny and poor as Talbot County 's , could have dreamed up the public school that Mike Biggs opened Aug. 17 in a former restaurant and hair salon next to the Talbotton Plaza Shopping Center on Ga . 41 . <p> Biggs , 39 , has enrolled 45 students ages 13 to 20 in what could be called the first real charter school in Georgia . <p> What makes his Talbot County Charter Alternative Academy radically different from the 27 other charter schools in the state is that Biggs , the founder and director , is from outside the local school system . Other differences : His staff of six includes no fully certified teachers , the students attend by their own choice and , although the Talbot County school system must send Biggs $ 5,700 a year for every student he enrolls , it does not have to provide a roof over the students ' heads . <p> These differences are the result of a new charter school law that went into effect July 1 . So far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerge under the new law , which enables nonprofit , nonreligious groups to open publicly funded schools as long as the local school district approves them . More than a dozen others are already busy preparing applications . <p> The students at TCCAA , most of whom have been expelled , jailed or held back , bear the physical and mental scars of failure . But here , under the broken electric menu board that last year advertised the Talk of the Town 's barbecue ribs and " 3 pc. dinner , $ 4.75 , " they are engaged in writing outlines from used biology textbooks and discussing group projects . They are electing a homecoming king and queen . <p> Biggs graduated from Troy State University in social science , worked as a mental health counselor and was the first director of Meriwether County 's alternative school . Back home since last spring in Talbot County , where he grew up , he is a man on a mission , trying to save black youth that remind him of himself , with academic problems similar to his own at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in social services and the business world . Although all are expected to be certified as teachers eventually , Biggs said , the school board waived this requirement . His teachers make $ 27,000 , about 6 percent more than starting teachers in Talbot County but without benefits and with longer hours , Biggs said . His principal , a 53-year-old third cousin with experience as a teacher , an engineer and a real estate agent , makes $ 52,000 . But Biggs is paying himself only $ 20,000 and is restlessly courting business support from here to Atlanta to make his dream succeed . <p> " This is my life , " he says of the modest little school . " If it fails , it wo n't be because I did n't put everything into it . " <p> TCCAA , in many ways , is typical of most of the 1,100 charter schools in the 33 states that have passed charter school laws since the movement began in 1991 . With about 240,000 children now enrolled  --  still less than half a percent of the total public school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for capital funds , serving needy populations ill-served by the existing system and infused with an energy rarely found in traditional public schools . <p> Nationally , advocates of the movement say charter schools introduce a healthy dose of competition to the existing school system by allowing private individuals or groups to meet the goals of public education in new ways on a contract , or charter , that spells out those goals directly to the public while allowing the school to operate apart from the education establishment and its rules . <p> Georgia 's original 1993 charter law allowed existing public schools to achieve some autonomy by applying for a charter , but since outside groups were excluded , the law was weak on competition and choice . Some national experts said Georgia 's law was not a true charter school law . <p> This year , the law was expanded to allow nonprofits a chance to pitch a charter idea to local school boards . Biggs won unanimous approval from the Talbot County school board in May , and , on Sept. 10 , became the first outsider to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education . When the unanimous vote was cast by the state board after Biggs ' presentation , the board and about 50 onlookers there for other business broke into sustained applause . Joe Nathan , a charter-school advocate who directs the Center for School Change at the University of Minnesota , sees charter schools in America as a needed challenge to a system " in which funding is a given and failure is accepted . " <p> National research on charter schools has revealed that , in some states , charter schools can create broad changes beyond their own campuses by inspiring whole systems to meet the competition . For example , in Flagstaff , Ariz. , the school district created all-day kindergartens , improved parent services and invited in the business community , all in response to a charter school initiating these things , he said . <p> It is not yet clear whether Georgia 's new law will create the same dynamic , since local school boards still have absolute power to veto any charter proposal . Here , local boards have little incentive to approve charter schools that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , but might be inclined to approve charters designed for students they would rather not have , as in Talbot County . Nathan said states that allow other avenues for approval , or for appeal of denial by a local school board , such as a state school board or separate state-run charter school commission , are far more likely to enjoy the wider benefit of competition . <p> Still , 17 private groups or individuals have applied for planning grants from the state Department of Education to design proposals , ranging from a kindergarten-to-sixth grade " African-centered methodology " school in Atlanta to a school-to-work " Opportunity Academy " for 8th-graders in Griffin . The state board is expected to vote on the grants Nov. 12 . <p> Biggs said he did n't have time to apply for a planning grant but still put together a 75-page charter petition . According to his petition , TCCAA will be a private nonprofit corporation run by an 11-member governing body , six of them parents or guardians elected at an annual school meeting . The first year 's budget , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five-year charter calls for an expansion to 100 students the second year and 200 the third year . The school will need a bigger home if it is to grow . <p> The charter calls for eighth-grade standardized test scores in five years to be 5 percent higher than the 1998 scores at Central High , the county system 's only high school , and for the percent of 11th-graders passing the state graduation test to rise a similar amount . TCCAA 's graduation rate will be better than Central 's , the charter says . <p> Edward Barnwell , the principal at Central High , said students who chose the charter school needed an alternative setting , and those who remained at Central will probably benefit by not having to be in class with youth uninterested in learning . The county 's elementary , middle and high schools are clustered in one location a half-mile away , with 879 students , 97 percent of them black , 90 percent impoverished and 5 percent retained each year , according to 1997 state data . No students were in gifted classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sixth and ninth grades and had spent many school days at home while suspended from Central High . He says he is happy to be at TCCAA now because the teachers take the time to help him , for example , going over math problems on the board step by step until he understands . Walker , who has a stitched gash over his right eyebrow from a hit by brass knuckles , says he is determined to graduate from the charter school in two years . <p> Biggs , who plays a kind of fatherly role around the school by encouraging individual students but correcting their grammar and their behavior , exudes a confidence that has inspired support from many . It helps , too , that he knows the people of Talbot County from his childhood and seems related to many of them . <p> " Mike has done an outstanding job to have the foresight to create something where there 's such a need , " said Johnny Johnson , a Los Angeles-based former National Football League defensive back whose company produces a video series , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school 's staff and students and is meant to teach self-confidence and life skills . <p> But the level of enthusiasm for the charter school bothers C. Robert Koon , a member of the Talbot County Development Authority who has been invited to be a member of the school 's governing board . Koon said he supports the idea of the school , but worries that not enough questions were raised by the community before it was approved . " This deserves dialogue , " he said . <p> Biggs acknowledges that TCCAA is bound to make some mistakes , and might even fail , as the first Georgia school of its kind . But charter school supporters around the state hope Biggs will blaze a trail for others . <p> " He 's not only the first , he has a win-win idea , " said Martha Nesbitt , a Savannah food writer who is organizing a proposed charter called Oglethorpe Academy , which she hopes will be approved by the Chatham County school board soon . Nesbitt , a middle-class white mother who works out of her home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openness . But since Biggs ' students were already on the street , or headed that way , she said , " You ca n't go wrong . Nobody can hate you . " Coming Monday : A look at the Edison Project , a for-profit business that is talking with some metro Atlanta school officials about running a few schools here . Reminded of himself by the students attending , Mike Biggs , 39 , founded the Talbot County Charter Alternative Academy in Talbotton . The school , located in a small building in a strip mall , still retains vestiges of its previous incarnations . It formerly housed the ' Talk of the Town ' restaurant and the ' Glam Slam ' salon . / KIMBERLY SMITH / Staff Map : Map shows location of Talbot in relation to Atlanta .
