Section : GARDENS TO VISIT With an architect 's eye and a plantsman 's passion , one man has fashioned a multifaceted gem <p> John Treasure was 80 this year . We first met in July 1952 . A mutual friend and I dropped in on him at his suburban bungalow in Tenbury Wells , and he was hoeing . That is characteristic ; John has always abominated weeds . <p> We soon became and have ever since remained close friends . It was a great thrill when , in 1954 , he and his brother acquired Burford House , an early 18th century brick dwelling , and its extensive grounds of 11 acres or so , which slope down to the steep banks of the River Teme and its tributary , the Ledwych . <p> At that time John was architect to the family building firm of Treasures at Ludlow . But not long after moving to Burford House he started the nursery firm , Treasures of Tenbury , which became famous for its clematis , winning a series of Gold Medals for exhibits at the Chelsea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Tenbury Wells and is on the boundaries of three counties : Shropshire ( in which it actually stands ) , Worcestershire , and Herefordshire . This is in the West Midlands and the countryside , with its rolling hills , red earth , and hop yards , is beautiful in a semiprosperous , semiuntamed way . The Welsh border is not far distant . Being in a river valley , the three and a half garden , which John designed from scratch with informal borders of sinuous outline set in sweeps of lawn , is subject to heavy mists , severe frosts ( by British standards  --  minus 7 degrees Fahrenheit was registered in the 1981-82 winter ) , and periodic floodings . These last ensure its fertility but also bring fresh supplies of weed seeds , carried in on the alluvium . <p> The main garden lies to the south of the house . The borders are all mixed  --  very mixed , from trees down , but also carefully considered . When I first knew the borders , there were masses of low-growing heathers , which unfortunately grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know their good fortune in finding them difficult ) . Every suburban British garden has to have its bed of heathers  --  long interest , beautiful color , ground cover , etc . But the plants are formless and lack presence . Lovely wild , on moorland ; they should stay there . I wo n't say John has got tired of them  --  he has never admitted that  --  but few are left . He has moved on , and there are other things . <p> He is a wizard with clematis and at growing them in different ways , not least of all on walls . Often he simply has them crawling over the ground but achieving height when they find shrubby obstacles in their path . For instance , C. texensis Duchess of Albany ' , with elongated pink bells , envelopes hard pruned bushes of the August-September flowering Caryopteris Kew Blue ' . <p> By and large , clematis which flower over a long period from midsummer , on their young growth , are the most rewarding . John has the viticella hybrids Abundance ' ( deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white eye ) splashing about on the ground but also growing up into the incredibly glaucous foliage of Berberis temolaica and over the tall blue Juniperus scopulorum Springbank ' . The magenta clematis Rouge Cardinal ' looks good over and among the upright pink spires of Erica vagans Mrs D.F . Maxwell ' and is probably killing her ( may the good lady rest in peace ) ; in gardening you have to take a fairly phlegmatic view of death by strangulation . He also grows clematis through his shrub roses , of which he 's very fond , training and tying them carefully around stakes each winter so that by June they look as though they 'd done it all themselves . <p> On the garden 's west side and , later , where he extended his operations to the east , John created stream beds . These habitats provide exciting opportunities for growing moisture-greedy plants . In water gardening we can gratify our appetite for a whole range of handsome aquatics and bogophiles ( I must patent that word ) . <p> I shall refrain from extolling the charisma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it has made itself rather comfortable ( but are n't you a shade too neurotic about it ? ) . Another kind of loosestrife , Lysimachia ephemerum , with spires of tiny white stars above lusty glaucous foliage , grows to six feet in John 's stream bed . <p> At its lowest end , the east stream broadens into a pool surrounded by informal paving and gentle banks where has created a sunken fern garden . Not just ferns  --  John does n't make the mistake of compartmentalizing his plantings  --  but also other associates such as hostas , hellebores , and Arundinaria viridistriata that like the same conditions of moisture and some shade . The ferns look all the better for their contrasting company . <p> Nearby , in a tree 's slightly deeper shade ( shade is easily overdone in England ) , I particularly like a ground cover of interlocking Helleborus argutifolium foliage ( with bold trifoliate leaves edges in mock prickles ) and a very dwarf and miniature lacecap hydrangea that I call Diadem ' , but maybe this is a synonym for his Hydrangea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisk ourselves across the south lawn to a completely open area just above the precipitous river bank , we can admire an energetic planting where John has interfolded flowering grasses with ferns . Early on an August morning , the fluffy heads of Pennisetum orientale were glistening , weighed down with dew , while by their side grew the upright plumey fronds of a shield fern , Polystichum bevis . " Ferns out in the sun ? " do you query with an ecological snort ? Eco-communities are stiff with contradictions . <p> The other , taller grasses here are Stipa gigantea , whose oatlike flower heads make a diaphanous pink veil in June , and Miscanthus sinensis Gracillimus ' , which admittedly does a lot better in the U.S. but is still worth growing here for its foliage , if not for its flowers . The spiky blue , porcupinelike Helictotrichon sempervirens is near at hand , and also wand flowers , Dierama pulcherrimum , their flexible but steel-strong stems bent over beneath the weight of their bells . ( John has the white form of this ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping our heads down , but I should mention that there are many good trees in the garden . Having been planted 30 or more years ago they are now as many feet high . A handsome dawn redwood , Metasequoia , for instance , stands at the bottom of the south lawn and near it the best Robinia pseudoacacia Frisia ' I have seen . It is a suburban favorite in England and its bright yellow coloring sticks out aggressively , but looks surprisingly comfortable near white willows on the river side . On my last visit a catalpa on the lawn was covered in panicles of white blossom , exceedingly popular with bees . I had n't realized before that it is sweetly scented . <p> Many birches thrive in our climate . With its pale trunk , Betula ermanii makes a strong feature alongside the south lawn . Across on the other side of the lawn is a Betula pendula Youngii ' . This is such lachrymose birch that a central branch had , originally , to be helped into an upright position by tying it to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quickly as they can and look as though they needed sorting out with a comb . Elsewhere , the dead white stem of B. jacquemontii has a border planting beneath its branches of Rhus glabra Laciniata ' and Liatris spicata Kobold ' in front . The sumac makes a suckering colony , which is cut annually to the ground , so that its foliage , exquisitely laced , is extra large . The liatris was generously planted so that its spikes of mauve flowers are strongly eye-taking . <p> Foliage appeals to John . I remember on a June visit the everlasting pea , Lathyrus grandifolus , with flowers of a dashing magenta , was climbing through an unpruned smoke bush , Cotinus coggygria Royal Purple ' . Hard pruning gives rise in this to the strongest purple foliage , and John generally prunes . So , imagine this cotinus as a background to the glaucous pinnate foliage of Melianthus major . <p> There are high old brick walls along the garden 's northern edge , giving the opportunity to grow tender shrubs such as Magnolia delavayi , with sumptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourished and flowered here for many years until it succumbed to a killer winter . The October flowering Buddleia auriculata has none of the coarseness of most buddleias . Cold winters never kill it outright , once it is fairly established , and it grows to 8 feet high after a hardish annual spring pruning . <p> Soon after buying the house , Treasures removed its Victorian wings . In place of the west wing there is now a small , enclosed courtyard garden with a central rectangular pool planted only with an arum lily , Zantedeschia aethiopica , and a pink waterlily ( Nymphae ) of beautiful form , Rose Magnolia . <p> This little formal garden is informally planted  --  so often the best treatment . Daphnes flourish remarkably here  --  Daphne collina , D. retusa , and the coarser D. tangutica , which , however , is generous in its second blooming in July-August . It has a strong evening and night fragrance . <p> As a feature of the paving there is Eryngium pandanifolium , an evergreen species from Uruguay with gold , saw-edged leaves and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paving cracks , Allium pulchellum , both in its lilac and white forms , self sows . With its whiskery bracts it has a lively personality . On the wall of the house is the blue evergreen Ceanothus xburkwoodii with the old double white Clematis florida Alba Plena ' trailing through it . <p> Fuchsias do well in this sheltered area , carrying on for many years . The evergreen climber , Berberidopsis corallina , with drooping waxy red clusters , will also flower strongly given a mild winter . <p> There is a sitting out terrace on the south front ( we seldom have to protect ourselves from sunshine in England ! ) in which the little Mexican daisy , Erigeron karvinskianus , seeds itself freely . Against the house is a huge specimen of Wisteria floribunda Macrobotrys ' , with its dramatically long mauve racemes . I notice that many Americans talk of wisterias with dread , as they might of a python in the bathroom , so vigorous and overwhelming are they in the east coast states , for instance . Not so here in our less sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juxtaposition in a bed below the terrace of Nicotiana Lime Green ' and Petunia Plum Purple ' with pronounced bicolor veining . Behind them was the purple and white fuchsia , Rose of Castille ' , behaving here as a hardy perennial rather than a shrub . John has always been fond of bedding plants , raised from seed or perpetuated annually from cuttings , and he likes experimenting with different combinations . He is a plantsman , too , but realizes that every plant is seen in a context . <p> If You Go <p> Burford House Gardens are located in Hereford , one mile west of Tenbury Wells on the A456 .

I prune and train these during the early-winter months , a long , patience-testing operation . Clematis was my first favorite , and if I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really have not got one , unless it be those delightful hybrids that are the progeny of the scarlet clematis from Texas . <p> After clematis I turned my attention to the old roses , and then to ferns ; there are many varieties of ferns in the garden and I would not be without them . Now that I have to work in the garden on my knees I find I have an increasing interest in alpines . But quite apart from all these " favorites , " I have over the years tried to build up an interesting collection of hardy and semihardy plants . <p> When I first started planting the garden , I made many errors , which I unashamedly admit . For the first two or three years I was constantly changing plants around , being dissatisfied with the locations I had originally chosen . A ' Koster ' blue space was moved on two or three occasions , as were Acer Pensylvanicum and many shrubs . Other plants had to be discarded either because their habit of growth offended me or they were ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on the riverside lawn had to go ; very pretty it was in spring , rather like the spring sequence in the Cinderella ballet , but quite unsuitable in that position . Six Swedish birches at the end of the south lawn also had to go ( one good specimen still remains ) , for a glade of birches was not the answer there . My mistakes have taught me a lesson : Look and think very hard before you leap ! <p> Hard winters have taken their toll in the garden . The winter of 1963 was a brute ; deep snow lay for many weeks and any garden work was delayed until early March . The winter of 1982-83 was the worst I ever remember . The cold was intense ; during the week of January 10 , I recorded night temperatures as low as -7 degrees with midday readings averaging 10 degrees . The losses in the garden were enormous . <p> Slowly the garden has matured , and I feel pleased with it , but never satisfied and always critical , which is as it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been enjoyable , and I believe my staff of two who help to maintain it would agree with me . ( I worked the garden by myself until the autumn of 1962 . ) Every year thousands of visitors from home and overseas come to the gardens ; many are full of praise and this gives me great Pleasure , not perhaps for my achievement but for the fact that it gives pleasure to others . <p> By John Treasure <p>
