Section : WALKER 'S WORLD <p> Phyllis Yaglowski recently wrote to me about something she lost while walking in Tennessee : the extra 90 pounds she 'd been carrying around for 20 years . As Prevention 's Walking Editor , I 've read lots of letters like hers about people who lose weight by walking . I 've met people who started walking to get some exercise in their lives and ended up getting whole towns into the act . I 've heard from , read letters from and met scores of ordinary people who , with a tiny seed of commitment , grew healthier , happier lives by walking . <p> So this month , I 've put together a " holiday letter " of sorts  --  like the ones you get from friends and families at this time of year . This way , I can keep you up to date on some of the insights and inspiration going on among walking friends across the country . LOST IN TENNESSEE <p> First off , let 's go back to Phyllis Yaglowski , the woman who walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me because , unlike a lot of now-skinny people , she can remember exactly what the pivotal point was when all the inner arguments against exercise stopped and when she committed herself to change . Her story may touch you , too : <p> Phyllis was visiting her mother in Kentucky . At the time , she was 51 years old and was carrying 235 pounds on her 5 ' 2 " frame . She 'd been losing weight slowly by regulating her eating for several months , but she had n't been able to convince herself to add exercise to her program . On that visit , her mother had two other guests : a friend and her 14-year-old granddaughter , Melissa , who had juvenile diabetes . <p> Says Phyllis : " One morning , Melissa came into the room where the rest of us were and said , ' I 've just tested my blood and my blood sugar is high . I have to go for a walk . ' It just hit me square in the face . Here was this lovely young girl for whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' Come on Melissa , I 'll walk with you . ' She told me she had to walk only half an hour , so I suggested we walk 15 minutes away from the house and then walk back , which we did . That walk changed my life . " <p> The next day , Phyllis got up before everyone else , and decided to try walking again . She kept on walking . " I lost 99 pounds on 40 minutes a day in 19 months . No excuses . I work a crazy schedule : swing shifts . When I work days , I start at 4:30 in the morning . Those days , I walk in the evening . When I 'm on nights , I come home , go to sleep , and as soon as I wake up , I take a walk . I was a size 24 and now I 'm a size 10 . " <p> Phyllis has an album where she keeps the stories of inspirational people . One is about an 87-year-old woman who still runs for exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifelong pursuit , so I love reading about older people who are still active . " THE ULTIMATE MALLWALKER <p> I remember meeting Sara Struve at Prevention 's All-American Walker 's Rally in Tampa , Florida , in 1989 . Sara was about my age and had recently taken up walking to lose weight . She got seriously involved in racewalking right away , and had traveled from Minneapolis to race in an event held in conjunction with the rally . I was impressed with her vivacious personality , her enthusiasm for walking and her down-to-earth attitude . <p> Recently Sara sent me a note to bring me up-to-date on where walking had taken her ... and why it had been so powerful a force in her life . <p> Sara was a die-hard dieter for many years , always struggling with extra weight . When her 10-year-old son finally became frustrated with her never-ending cycle ( the whole family went on her diets ) , he asked that she " never diet again . " <p> " He really saw the vicious circle of my predicament , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also saw it . When I promised to stop dieting , I knew I had to find another way to control my weight . And because running and aerobics caused back problems for me , walking became , almost by default , my choice . Interestingly , several years later , my son went through an agonizing time of withdrawal into drugs and alcohol . Walking , which I had in effect begun because of him , was a major support for me when we went through that time . It kept me from imploding with fear and guilt . " <p> Sara trained for racewalking for several years , not only entering events , but winning awards . Gradually , racing took a backseat to judging racewalks ( " somebody has to do it " ) and spreading the word to her community about the benefits of walking . When administrators approached her to coordinate a walking program for their 4.2-million-square-foot Mall of America , Sara was ready for the job . The mall has four levels , three of them with a half-mile loop ( not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " card they run through a special machine when they come to walk for fitness during specified hours . At monthly meetings , computer printouts show how many minutes everyone has walked and prizes are awarded accordingly . <p> " Of course people could cheat and go shopping for an hour , instead of fitness walking , but what would be the point ? " says Sara . " Besides , everybody watches everybody else ! " <p> With the Mall of America in full stride , Sara went on to organize the skyways of Minneapolis and St. Paul into convenient " health clubs " for downtown workers . ( The winters in the twin cities are cold and windy and the skyways were built to connect downtown buildings so people do n't have to go outside . ) Meetings of the Skywalker Clubs are held at lunch-time in a central location , so workers can participate . They receive a quarterly newsletter and work toward awards . Downtown businesses now recommend Sara 's program to their employees , and there are more than 600 members in each city . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Sara . " I 'm not in charge of anybody else but me . And walking is the way I take care of me . I enjoy sharing that with others . " Look out for Sara . She plans on going national with her mallwalking program ! LOOSENED UP IN HAWAII <p> Diane Shuey wrote me a note a few months ago . She 's a new Prevention reader and has been walking for four years . I was awed by the magnificence of the backdrop she has for her daily constitutional and was equally impressed at how well her experience tells the universal story of walking . <p> But first , the scene : " I live on the slopes of Haleakala Crater in a little town called Makawao on the island of Maui , Hawaii . Makawao is one of the few remaining towns where you can still tie your horse up in front of the general store and do a little shopping . <p> " My walks take me through lush green pastureland . The road is lined with eucalyptus trees , night-blooming jasmine , plumaria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cows and goats . If I look straight in front of me , I can see the top of the Haleakala Crater . Behind me I can see the north and south shores of the Valley Isle . " Diane , if I ever get over to Hawaii , I hope you 'll take me for a long walk in your neighborhood ! <p> Now the story , in her own words : " I just finished my 3.8-mile walk . I started walking 4 years ago after I read so many articles about the benefits . I have arthritis in my ankles , hips and hands . It used to be very hard for me to get moving in the morning , because of the stiffness . As I started walking , I could feel the ankle and hip joints loosening up . The more I walked , the looser I became . I gained muscle tone and strength . And I started to sit up straighter . <p> " My clothes are looser and I have much more mental and physical energy , handling life 's problems with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of walking , you will make time for it and never want to stop . It makes you feel so alive ! I will be 50 years old next month , and I honestly feel better than I did at 25 ! So come on , guys , slip on your walking shoes !
