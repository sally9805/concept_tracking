Section : Trial by cross-section . <p> Was there a single news report on the Rodney King verdict  --  setting off the Los Angeles riots last spring  --  that failed to mention the racial composition of that jury in Simi Valley ? The universal assumption was that ten whites , one Asian , and one Hispanic could not fairly decide a case in which white police officers were accused of beating a black man , or at least that a verdict of acquittal rendered by such a jury could never be accepted as fair . Even if we indignantly reject the first assumption , events might force us to concede the second . <p> Suppose you had the job of choosing the people called for jury duty in the court where William Lozano is to be retried  --  that 's the Miami police brutality case  --  or where the " L.A. Four " will be tried for their part in the televised attack on Reginald Denny , the truck driver dragged from his vehicle at the start of the Rodney King riots . Or just suppose your court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Current political sensibilities virtually demand that the pool of potential jurors show a good racial and ethnic mix . The closer you can get to proportional representation , the better people will like it . <p> Supreme Court rulings on the composition of juries pull in the same direction . In 1975 the Court announced that the Sixth Amendment guarantee of an " impartial jury " in criminal cases required that jury lists ( though not the jury actually seated in a particular case ) reflect a " fair cross-section " of the communities from which they were drawn . This was a new requirement , and it changed the law more radically than might at first appear . <p> Earlier constitutional doctrine had imposed a negative standard  --  no discrimination  --  drawn from the Fourteenth Amendment . States could not exclude blacks , women , or any other significant group from jury service , either overtly or by the discriminatory application of a neutral standard . But a rule of non-discrimination does not require any particular result : states were free to draw potential jurors exclusively from lists of registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was open to all on equal terms . By contrast , a constitutional requirement of " fair cross-section " imposes an affirmative duty to put together a jury list in which significant groups are appropriately represented . As criminals began to get their convictions reversed on the ground that women or blacks ( or , in later cases , Hispanics or young adults ) were underrepresented in local jury lists , court administrators moved swiftly to rectify any imbalance . <p> DeKalb County , Georgia , where I happen to live , offers an extreme example of the procedures adopted in some jurisdictions . The traditional source of potential jurors in Georgia is the list of registered voters . Because various groups within the population are not equally likely to be registered , however , a jury list drawn at random from the voter list underrepresents some categories by comparison with census figures  --  notably blacks , males , and people aged 18 to 34 . In the aftermath of the Supreme Court 's " fair cross-section " decision , county officials tried first to supplement the voter list with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-voters to volunteer for jury duty . These efforts were notably unsuccessful . Faced with the choice between balancing its jury list and losing its ability to convict criminals , DeKalb County decided to adopt the desired results directly . <p> The method is straightforward . By an analysis of census data , the entire voting-age population of the county is broken down into those groups treated as " cognizable . " The relevant groups at present are black males , black females , white males , white females , " other " males , and " other " females , each subdivided into age groups 18 to 24 , 25 to 34 , 35 to 44 , 45 to 54 , 55 to 64 , and 65 plus . Taken together , these categories yield a grid of thirty-six squares : each square is assigned " requested quota totals " by percentage and , for a jury list of given magnitude , by head count . The computer fills the quotas by a random draw from the list of registered voters in the various categories . ( Yes , Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once arguably unconstitutional , is now welcomed by the Justice Department as a means of facilitating its review of the state 's compliance with the Voting Rights Act . ) <p> The computer selection is necessarily less random for some classes of voters than for others . Any black male aged 18 to 24 who registers to vote is virtually guaranteed a spot on the jury list . By contrast , the chance that someone in my own group ( middle-aged white male voters ) will find his name on the most recent list is just over one in eight . The disparities are less pronounced for other sectors of the grid , but black voters overall are still nearly 40 percent more likely to be drawn than white voters . Jury duty is commonly thought to be one of the burdens of citizenship , not one of its benefits , and its uneven incidence along racial lines appears to deny equal treatment to black voters  --  subjecting them , in effect , to a racially discriminatory tax on suffrage . <p> The jury list that results from this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-section of anything . It reflects neither the voting population nor ( since non-voters are excluded ) the county as a whole . But that 's not the objective . What DeKalb County gets for its trouble is a bulletproof jury list , one in which each " cognizable group " enjoys near-perfect proportional representation . As I was told at the courthouse , " When people want to challenge our jury list , we show them these figures . They challenge something else . " <p> The case in which the Supreme Court announced the fair cross-section requirement involved a law affecting the jury participation of women . A Louisiana statute ( already repealed when the Court declared it unconstitutional ) required that women be left off jury lists unless they filed a notice of their wish to be included . Plainly , an " opt-in " provision like this could have been held unconstitutional under the old non-discrimination standard . ( If an optional exemption for women strikes you as a quaint but well-meaning accommodation of the burdens of motherhood , imagine an identical " opt-in " requirement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law on the very different ground that it infringed a criminal defendant 's affirmative right to a jury drawn from " a representative cross-section of the community . " The announcement of a new constitutional test , in a case that could easily have been decided on the basis of an old one , signaled an important change in the way the Court conceived the underlying problem . <p> The shift from non-discrimination to fair cross-section as a standard for jury lists paralleled the redefinition of other , more visible aspects of the law of race during the early 1970s . School desegregation turned into racial balancing ; " no discrimination " in employment under the Civil Rights Act came to mean " no disparate impact " ; " voting rights " became a claim to proportional representation . The transition in every case was from a prohibition of racial discrimination to a demand for race-specific results . The social ideal reflected by the legal rules was no longer a world in which racial distinctions were irrelevant , but one in which racial groups achieved representation in proportion to their numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sixth Amendment right to trial by a cross-section of the community made a problematic addition to the list , because it imposed a requirement that the Court was not prepared to address in logically coherent fashion . " Fair cross-section , " the Court has insisted , concerns only the jury list . Neither the group summoned to jury duty on a particular day , nor the panel of prospective jurors assigned to a particular case , nor the jury ultimately seated needs meet the test . But this crucial limitation is practical , not logical . Once the consensus of " a representative cross-section of the community " is deemed necessary to produce a just verdict ( or a verdict publicly perceived as just ) , then there is no way to explain why the panel from which each jury is selected should not present a representative cross-section ; or , for that matter , why the twelve jurors who hear the case should not reflect in obtainable proportion the " cognizable groups " within the community . If we accept the underlying premise of " fair cross-section " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant no more than a sporting chance at a trial meeting what is implicitly the constitutional standard . <p> Some court officials not only accept this logic but propose to do something about it . Instead of summoning potential jurors at random , some Georgia counties have tried programming their computers to summon jurors in groups that mirror the carefully constructed proportionality of the master list . ( The practice has been criticized by the Georgia Supreme Court , and its present extent is difficult to ascertain . ) In Hennepin County , Minnesota  --  commonly regarded as one of the nation 's most progressive , reform-minded jurisdictions in matters of criminal justice  --  a task force has recommended that at least two seats on every twenty-three-member grand jury be reserved for members of racial minorities . The proposal is currently under consideration by the Minnesota Supreme Court . If a minority quota can be adopted for grand juries , comparable procedures for trial juries are the logical next step . <p> The social and political forces favoring some degree of race-conscious jury selection are nearly irresistible at present , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical constraints would be idle . Yet when the question arises  --  as it will , sooner or later  --  we should hope that the courts will avoid saying that institutionalized racial quotas are permissible , whether for jury lists or for juries themselves . <p> The old aspiration that government deal with individuals without regard to race has a particular force where it touches the voting booth or the jury box . The argument for proportional representation in legislatures and courtrooms rests on the unmistakable premise that a person can neither represent another 's interests effectively nor judge him fairly unless he is of the same race . That is the repulsive implication of the modern law of " voting rights , " which  --  since both political parties have apparently decided that it serves their own interests  --  we are plainly stuck with for the foreseeable future . We now run the risk of extending the same destructive premise to modify our official conception of what constitutes a fair and impartial jury . <p> Grant , for the sake of argument , that raw racial nerves perceive potential unfairness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury . " This is a reason to try to avoid seating many such juries . It is still not a reason to admit , at a constitutional level , that a juror 's race can be of any consequence . If either the DeKalb County jury list or the proposed Hennepin County grand jury quota were upheld against a constitutional challenge , the implication would be that the judgment of citizens of different races is so fundamentally different that a fair and impartial jury can not be constituted without offering to each group , in effect , a racial veto . This comes close to denying that Americans of different races share a common citizenship . Some people might deny that we do . Yet a Constitution even acknowledging such a proposition would describe a political system far less attractive than the one to which we ought to aspire . <p> We still have a choice in the matter . If the ideal of non-discrimination were thought to be important enough , DeKalb County could pursue racially mixed juries the hard way : supplementing voter registration as a source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipients , and every other source of adult citizens ' names . Georgia counties do n't do it this way , for two reasons . One is the additional time , trouble , and expense . But the second reason is probably the decisive one : trying to come up with a fair-cross-section jury list simply by spreading the net wider will never yield quota-perfect results . No judge has ruled that jury lists must match census data to a tenth of a percentage point , the way they do here , but from the standpoint of a court administrator it 's impossible to err on the side of proportionality . The only countervailing consideration  --  other than the burden on the black voters , which anyone can avoid by not registering  --  is the distaste people once felt for the government 's sorting people by race . <p> The alternative to race-specific measures , in jury selection as in everything else , is the long , costly process of constructing a system whereby race-neutral procedures produce socially acceptable results . The country has been unwilling to undertake that burden in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition  --  where the pressure for a suitably proportional result is , if anything , more intense than elsewhere  --  a return to the constitutional standard of non-discrimination is plainly not foreseeable . That is not to say , however , that the resort to racial quotas in the selection of juries  --  directly or indirectly  --  should be constitutionally permissible . <p> Recent Supreme Court decisions prohibiting the use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors on racial grounds  --  widely hailed by civil rights advocates  --  carry necessarily different implications about race and the jury system from those that underlie " fair cross-section . " In one of the peremptory-challenge cases , Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that " if race stereotypes are the price for public acceptance of a jury panel as fair , the price is too high to meet the standard of the Constitution . " The standard of the Constitution confounds the assumptions of every newspaper story and television newscast about the high-profile trials by which the issue of jury composition comes to public notice . The news media are surely not wrong about this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we ca n't realistically deny and what we ca n't afford to admit . Better to live with such a contradiction than to resolve it , however , because it preserves for future use a charter for a better society than the one we now inhabit . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Andrew Kull <p> <p> ANDREW KULL is the author of the Color-Blind Constitution ( Harvard University Press ) . <p>
