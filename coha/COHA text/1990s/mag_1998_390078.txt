Section : THE TIME MACHINE Fifty Years Ago The Geeks Have a Word for It <p> As 1945 came to an end , America 's intellectuals and pseudo-intellectuals were avidly discussing the book that would launch a thousand compound words , Cybernetics : Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine , by Norbert Wiener . The book had come out in the fall but took a while to catch on as readers struggled with its daunting mix of mathematical notation ( which pops up without warning around page 60 ) , formal logic , metaphysics , neurophysiology , psychopathology , electronics , and socialism , all set forth in orotund sentences of baffling length and complexity . Like the latter-day Goedel , Escher , Bach and The Name of the Rose , Cybernetics became known as a book that millions bought and dozens finished . In time , however , enough readers either fought their way through or skipped the hard parts to make Cybernetics the hottest thing in faculty lounges , coffeehouses , and dormitory rooms across the country . <p> Wiener was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the age of fourteen . As a boy he had had the good fortune to be overshadowed by an even greater whiz kid , William James Sidis , who lectured at Harvard on four-dimensional bodies in 1910 at age eleven . Unlike Wiener , Sidis soon tired of academic life and fled from public view , and however abstruse Cybernetics may seem , it can not help being more interesting than Sidis 's only publication , a three-hundred-page treatise on streetcar transfers . Wiener went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy from Harvard ( after getting kicked out of Cornell ) in 1913 and eventually ended up in the mathematics department at MIT . Cybernetics brought together decades ' worth of his scattershot notions about intelligent machines , feedback , causality , geometry , perception , and just about everything else . <p> Nowadays critics tend to agree that Wiener was a much better thinker than writer . One biographer calls Cybernetics " a collection of misprints , wrong mathematical statements , mistaken formulas , splendid but unrelated ideas , and logical absurdities . " Another says : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuss was about . " Despite its flaws , Cybernetics remains influential among those stout souls with the patience to disentangle Wiener 's worthwhile thoughts from the morass . Still , the book 's most pervasive legacy is the first half of its title . <p> As the inventor of a new field , Wiener had the privilege of naming it . Since his ideas were all related ( quite loosely in some cases ) to the concept of control and guidance , he came up with a word based on the Greek kubernetes , meaning " helmsman " or " steersman . " Wiener later learned that comparable terms had been used in the 1840s by the French physicist Andre-Marie Ampere ( cybernetique ) and a Polish writer named Trentowski ( cypernetyki ) . Further inquiry discovered a similar word in one of Plato 's dialogues . <p> The usefully vague neologism spread rapidly , and in the 1950s and 1960s it seemed to appear in the title of every book with pretensions of deepness : Psycho-Cybernetics , Philosophy and Cybernetics , even The Cybernetic ESP Breakthrough . Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to almost any situation , and if it was used with sufficient assurance , readers or listeners would blame themselves when they did n't understand what it meant . <p> Compounds began to spring up too , such as cybernation ( control by machines ) , cyborg ( a human-machine hybrid , contracted from cybernetic organism ) , and the cyberpunk school of science fiction . But it took the Internet to make a prefix denoting control grow completely out of control . Once everyone had heard all the puns that could be made from the phrase information superhighway , cyber- became the favorite way to indicate that something was related to computers . Hackers were said to be in cyberspace instead of the more precise but less impressive wasting time with video games . A tabloid headline used cyberslut to describe a woman accused of making adulterous assignations via the Internet . The 1998 Manhattan telephone directory lists more than fifty businesses that start with the prefix , including the menacing Cybergirl and the mysterious Cyberitalian . There is no telling how Wiener , who died in 1964 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he coined . It 's likely , though , that he would have taken enthusiastically to cyberspace , whose constant jumping from topic to topic can be every bit as engrossing and annoying as his book . Gidget Meets Frosty <p> Southern California awoke to find lawns covered with frost , pipes and car radiators frozen , and breath condensing into clouds when they ventured outside . On the way to work , drivers wrestled with the unfamiliar sensation of skidding on frozen pavement . The worst cold wave in anyone 's memory had brought unfathomable temperatures across the entire region : 28 in Los Angeles ( that 's Fahrenheit ) , 23 in Pasadena , 22 in Palm Springs . Even San Diego recorded an overnight low of 27 . A dense layer of smog covered the area , this time not from cars but from ten million kerosene heaters lit by citrus growers in an effort to save their crops . Although the smog was thick enough to close Los Angeles Harbor and Long Beach Airport and leave an oily film on clothes and furniture , the heaters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many farming districts . <p> The freeze came on the heels of an equally unusual Southern California event : a Rose Bowl victory by Northwestern . After the Wildcats ' 20-14 defeat of California , a train carrying hundreds of fans got stuck in a blizzard in Cheyenne , Wyoming . The enterprising Northwestern students took advantage of the enforced layover to write and perform a short play . With equal resourcefulness , a Hollywood press agent converted the foul weather into a photo opportunity . The next week 's Life magazine featured a picture of a blonde starlet named Cleo Moore , who was holding a snowball and either smiling or grimacing as flakes fell to earth past her skimpy two-piece sunsuit . Miss Moore parlayed the shot into a career in 1950s low-budget films with titles like One Girl 's Confession and Women 's Prison , proving that even in Southern California , it 's an ill wind that blows no good . <p> By Frederic D.
