" Drive for show ; putt for dough " is an expression golfers understand . So should members of Congress , many of whom are fond of playing the game at someone else 's expense . However , despite the legislative long balls hit over the past season , Capitol Hill 's 535 members were unable to master one essential stroke : reforming the rules for their own behavior . True , both the House and Senate gave the appearance of movement on laws designed to tighten campaign financing and lobbying regulations . But both bodies moved so late and in such contradictory directions that any reconciliation they are able to fashion next year would still not apply to 1994 elections . <P> It was n't supposed to be this way . A Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress spent the year contemplating ways to change lawmakers ' staffing and spending . After producing many recommendations , though , none have been enacted . <P> Least of all the zealous proposals by some reform-minded neophytes to limit gifts  --  such as the meals and trips  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the watchdog group Public Citizen showed that in 1991 House members took 4,000 free trips , two-thirds of them paid for by corporations or trade associations . <P> As matters stand , it 's perfectly legal for members to accept speechmaking or " briefing " invitations from well-heeled lobbyists  --  typically at cushy resorts in balmier climes during dreary winter months . Last January , for example , U.S. Tobacco staged a legislative briefing in Boca Raton , Florida , with 17 past and present members of Congress . In April , 10 members and their spouses spent four days and three nights at the South Seas Plantation resort off Florida 's Gulf Coast , with airfares , hotel bills and , of course , greens fees paid for by the Electronics Industries Association . <P> Idealistic first-termers in Congress tried unsuccessfully to impose a $20 limit on gifts that members may accept from lobbyists . That measure would have had no effect on the seaside getaways favored by the Congressional Golf Caucus , as the regular junketeers are derisively called . Still , when the proposal stalled , fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a million reasons for why this is a problem or that is a problem , " complains one freshman lawmaker . Foley first insisted that he was not blocking the measure , then cited miscommunication with the Republicans when the measure failed to get a vote last week . Not so , countered the G.O.P. , prompting Foley to claim that there may have been " some misunderstanding . " <P> You 're up , Mr. Speaker .
