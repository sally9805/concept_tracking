TIME 's coverage of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century will culminate in December , when we name a single figure as the Person of the Century .

Living as we do on a speck in a universe whose extent is beyond our capacity to fathom , the unprecedented growth of human power has correspondingly created an imperative for humility . It is no accident that during a life of incomparable scientific achievement , Einstein often said , " God does not play dice with the universe . " <P>  --  Henry A. Kissinger , former U.S. Secretary of State                  @ @ @
