<p> This city in the heart of Basque country , known around the world mostly for separatist terrorism , will take its place on the world stage in October for a nonviolent reason . <p> It is then that an American-designed art museum of the highest architectural order will open its doors here . Paid for entirely with local funds , the $ 100 million structure is a symbol of Basque regional power and independence that its sponsors hope will attract visitors from all over Europe . <p> But it turns out that the museum and the terrorism are not unrelated . In a city that is home to half of Spain 's Basques , the museum also is the cornerstone of a broad-based campaign against the violence that has cost nearly 800 lives in 30 years . It is a campaign focused not on police and guns , but on culture and investment . <p> Bilbao and all of the Basque country are undergoing a massive , $ 1-billion-plus redevelopment designed to undercut the separatists by allowing mainstream Basque nationalist pride to flourish in the sunlight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , if Basques govern their own fate  --  and hold their own purse strings . <p> If the effort succeeds , it may offer lessons to other developed nations with angry ethnic minorities . If it fails , more people will die . <p> " We think culture will help combat the violence , " said Bilbao Deputy Mayor Ibon Areso . " It 's not the only goal of the museum , but it 's important . More and more , the cultural and economic aspects are related . If we can raise the economic level , young people will be less attracted to violence . " <p> Last week was fiesta week in Bilbao , and signs of the redevelopment were everywhere . Revelers could take the new subway  --  modeled on Washington 's Metro  --  to the bullfights , walk across gleaming new pedestrian bridges to the outdoor concerts , look down the Bilbao River from the fireworks display and see the gleaming facades of the museum . <p> A new airport is under construction , and a neighboring high-tech business corridor is attracting foreign and Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local orchestra is rising from the shells of broken-down factories on the riverbanks and , farther along the river , a library and cultural center is being built . The entire port of Bilbao , on which the local economy once was based , is being moved downriver and offshore , at a cost of $ 258 million . <p> The regional parliament just approved a sweeping plan for urban renewal designed to revitalize the decayed riverfront along its entire 10-mile length from Bilbao to the Atlantic , placing office , commercial and institutional space beside , and even in , the river . High-speed rail connections to Madrid and Paris are planned , as is a thorough cleaning of the foul-smelling river . <p> Such grand projects often founder on financing , and some of these may not come to pass . But the Basque country has both the political clout to extract money from Madrid and the European Union in Brussels and the autonomy to raise its own revenue . The intent of both Basque politicians and the government of Spain is clear  --  to use development and prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process , to marginalize and weaken the violent separatist movement known by its Basque initials , ETA . <p> " There is a collective desire to transform the city of Bilbao , " said Alfonso Vegara , director of the Madrid architectural and planning firm that created the regional plan . " The project has a high political and social meaning . If the Basque country can succeed with the project , they can find themselves again . " <p> The jewel of the project is the museum . Designed by California architect Frank Gehry , its vaguely maritime , vaguely petaled shapes dominate the riverbank . Its gray titanium panels reflect the industrial history of the city : Its towering glass panels are open to the river view , and its limestone towers are made of local materials . More than 90 percent of the work was done by Basque companies . <p> Local and regional officials hope the museum will alter the image of this run-down industrial city and become a symbol of rebirth that will attract tourists and businesses and spur growth . It was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will manage the museum and display some of its vast collection of 20th-century art there . It will also have a sizable component of Basque art . With much fiscal sacrifice , Basque governments are paying the entire price ; the Spanish national government is not involved . <p> " They 're reaching out with this building to the global society , " Gehry said . " That 's what this is all about . They could subsume themselves with the rest of Spain , but they choose not to . " <p> The Basques , nestled in the rocky hills below the Pyrenees for 4,000 years , represent one of the oldest surviving cultures in Europe . Their homeland was divided between southwestern France and northern Spain in 1512 , but the people preserved their language  --  which has no known connections to any other  --  against both French and Spanish . <p> Even as steel , shipbuilding and shipping blossomed here during the Industrial Revolution and after , kings and other rulers in Madrid revoked rights and powers the Basques felt should remain with them . During the reign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basque in public or studying it in school was forbidden . <p> In 1958 , ETA was formed to fight such oppression ; its first killing was carried out in 1968 . Since then , it is estimated , about 800 people have died at the hands of ETA . <p> One of its most vicious assassinations came on July 10 . On that day , ETA gunmen kidnapped Miguel Angel Blanco Garrido , 29 , a town council member from the Basque village of Ermua . Blanco was a member of Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar 's center-right Popular Party . <p> ETA said it would kill Blanco unless some 500 Basque prisoners in jails around Spain were transferred to prisons in Basque country . They were not , and 48 hours later Blanco was found lying by the side of a country road , shot twice in the head . He died shortly afterward . <p> Spain went into mourning . A half-million people demonstrated in the streets of Madrid . The same number  --  one quarter of the entire Basque-country population  --  marched in Bilbao , calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Madrid has intensified police efforts against ETA , but the more important developments may be occurring in this region . The town council of the village of Mondragon threw out its mayor , a member of ETA 's political wing , and replaced him with a moderate from the mainstream Basque National Party . And some residents of Bilbao are boycotting restaurants and stores owned by people with ETA connections . The feeling is that ETA has gone too far . <p> Fewer Basques are aligning themselves with ETA 's political arm , called Herri Batasuna ( Popular Unity ) . Herri Batasuna has refused to condemn the ETA killings on grounds that they will stop when all the Basque provinces , including those in France and in the neighboring Spanish region of Navarre , are politically united and can exercise their right to self-determination . <p> " We say if ETA continues the armed struggle , it is because there is no Basque democracy , " said Karmelo Landa Mendibe , the party spokesman and one of 11 Herri Batasuna members of the Basque regional parliament . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To Herri Batasuna , the museum , the subway , the airport and the other projects are part of a Spanish plot to buy off Basque nationalism . " The museum is fantastic ; the building is magnificent , but it should not be used as a mirror to hide the truth , " Landa said . " The investment for the museum has drained funds for Basque cultural activities . We have other cultural and social needs . " Among them is an unemployment rate of 23 percent , one of the highest in Spain . <p> The museum has cost a great deal of money indeed  --  about $ 100 million to design and build , plus overhead and art acquisition that bring the total cost to roughly $ 130 million . And it will lose money each year even if a forecast of 500,000 visitors annually proves accurate . Moreover , Inaki Esteban , coauthor of a book on the museum , has pointed out that museums do not have a great track record as anchors for economic development . <p> But even the most ardent supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fine office buildings will not stop the killing no matter how slim support becomes for ETA and Herri Batasuna , which received 15 percent of the vote in the last regional election . The problem , they say , is that ETA is not really a political organization at all , but a kind of economic way of life . <p> By demanding the regular payment of so-called " revolution taxes "  --  protection money  --  from companies and rich individuals , ETA has created a self-perpetuating organization that will fight to preserve itself no matter how much autonomy and political pride come to the Basque country . Landa confirmed that ETA survives on these payments .
