It had been a hundred years since Hershleder had taken in a late afternoon movie , a hundred years since he had gone to the movies by himself . It was 5:45 . There was a 6:15 train Hershleder could still make . But why give in , why not not do something as inevitable as being home on time for dinner ? At heart he was a rebel . Hershleder walked up the avenue to Kips Bay . There , there was a movie house . He could enter the theater in daylight . When was the last time he had done that  --  gone from a dazzling summer afternoon , when the air was visible and everything looked like it was in a comic book , only magnified , broken down into a sea of shimmering dots into the dark , cool mouth of a movie theater ? It was a dry July day . It was hot out . Who cared what was playing ? Porno . Action . Comedy . All Hershleder wanted was to give himself over to something . <p> He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl behind the counter was dispensing pharmaceutical cocaine and he was still a young and reckless intern  --  the kind he had always planned on being , the kind Hershleder was only in his dreams . She had big hair . Brown hair , sprayed and teased into wings . She had a dark mole beneath her pink lips on the left-hand side of her face . It looked like the period that marks a dotted quarter in musical notation . She was a beautiful girl in an interesting way . Which means if the light were right ( which it was n't quite then ) , if she held her chin at a particular angle ( which she did n't , her chin was in a constant seesaw on account of the gum ) when she laughed or when she forgot about pulling her lips over her teeth ( which were long and fine and , at the most reductive-canine ) she was a lovely , cubist vision . <p> Hershleder bought two tickets from this young girl . He bought two tickets out of force of habit . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket taker and realized that he was alone . <p> Back at the box office , the girl would n't grant Hershleder a refund . She said : " It 's a done deal , doll . " But she smiled at him . <p> Hershleder gave the extra ticket to a bag lady who sat under the marquee where the sidewalk was slightly mote shaded than the street , where the open and close of the glass doors to the air-conditioned theater provided the nearest thing to an ocean breeze that she would feel on this , her final face . <p> Hershleder the blind , Hershleder the dumb-oblivious to the thrill of a beautiful big-haired girl 's lyrical smile , a smile a musician could sight-read and play . Blind and stuck with an extra ticket , Hershleder gave it away to the old lady . He was n't a bad guy , really . Had n't the old woman once been somebody 's baby ? Was n't it possible , also , that she was still somebody 's mother ? Were there ever two more exalted roles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinnacle of her being ; and she 'd fallen . She suffered from La Tourrette . Hershleder held the glass door open for her ; he 'd been well raised by his own mother , a woman with a deep residing respect for the elderly . <p> " Bastard , " said the old lady , smiling shyly . " Cocksucker . " <p> Hershleder smiled back at her . Here was someone who spoke his language . Had n't he seen a thousand and one patients like her before ? <p> " Fucking Nazi prick , " the woman said , he voice trailing low as she struggled to gain control of herself . Her face screwed up in concentration ; she wrestled with her inner , truer self . " Faggot , " she said through clenched teeth ; she bowed her head now , trying to direct her voice back into her chest . The next word came out like an exhalation of smoke , in a puff , a whisper : " Motherfucker . " <p> The old lady looked up at Hershleder from beneath hooded lids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not held back , of words unleashed , epithets unfettered  --  there was a locker room of vile language in her head , but her face seemed apologetic . When Hershleder met her gaze , she fluttered her lashes , morse-coding like the quadiplegic on Ward A , then turned and shuffled away from him . <p> It was delicious inside the theater . Cold enough for Hershleder to take off his jacket and lay it flat like a blanket across his chest . His hand wandered across his crotch , stroked his belly . In the flirtation of film light , Hershleder felt himself up under the curtain of his jacket . There were a couple of teenagers in the back of the house who talked throughout the movie , but what did Hershleder care ? It was dark , there was music . Stray popcorn crunched beneath his feet . A side door opened , and he got high off the smell of marijuana wafting on a cross breeze . An old man dozed in an end seat across the aisle . A beautiful girl on screen displayed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , drowning Hershleder 's view . Above war planes flew , bombs dropped , the girl moaned , fire fire fire . Something was burning On screen ? Off screen ? The exit sign was the reddest thing he 'd ever seen . It glowed on the outskirts of his peripheral vision . Time passed in a solid leap , as in sleep , as in coma . When the lights came up , Hershleder was drowsily aware that much had happened to him  --  but what ? Could n't the real world have jumped forward at the rate of onscreen time in quantum leaps of event and tragedy and years ? The movies . Like rockets hurtling a guy through space . <p> It was a way to make the hours pass , that 's for sure , thought Hershleder . For a moment he had no clue as to what day it was . <p> Grand Central Station . <p> Hershleder waited for information . On the south wall was a huge photo essay , Kodak 's , presenting the glories of India . A half-naked child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his smile radiant . A bony cow . A swirl of sari , a lovely face , a red dot like a jewel amidst the light filigree of a happy forehead . A blown-up piece of poori : a bread cloud . The Taj Mahal ... In All Its Splendor . <p> The lobby of Bellevue looked something like this . The women in their saris , the homeless beggars , the drug addicts that punctuated the station like restless exclamation marks . Inge , his chief lab technician , had told him that at the hospital , in the ground floor women 's bathrooms , mothers bathed their babies in the sinks . Hershleder could believe this . There , like here , was a place to come in out of the cold , the rain , the heat . <p> The signboard fluttered its black lids , each train announcement inched its way up another slot . Hershleder 's would depart from Track 11 . There was time for half a dozen oysters at the Oyster Bar . He headed out past Zaro 's Bakery , the bagels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cholesterol  --  how it could slather the aeries with silken ecstacy ! ( Hershleder had to watch himself . Oysters would do the trick  --  in more ways than one . What was that old joke ... the rules of turning forty : never waste an erection , never trust a fart . ) He hung a left , down the curved , close passageway  --  the tunnel that felt like an inner tube , an underground track without the track , an alimentary canal , a cool stone vagina . Vagrants sagged against the walls , sprawled beneath the archways . There was a souvenir stand . A book store . A florist ! Daisies , bright white for Itty , beckoned from earthenware vases . This was a must-stop on his future trek to Track 11 . The passageway smelled like a pet store . The horrible inevitable decay of everything biological , the waste , the waste ! Hershleder did a little shocked pas de bourree over a pretzel of human shit , three toe-steps , as lacy as a dancer 's . <p> They slid down easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the polished wood and ordered another half dozen . Not liquid , not solid  --  a fixed transitional state . A second beer . So what if he missed his train ? There would always be another . Death and taxes . Conrail and the Erie Lackawanna . The fact that oysters made him horny . <p> They slid down cold and wet . Peppery . Hershleder was n't one to skimp on hot sauce . The shell against his upper lip was blue and smooth , his lower lip touched lichen or was it coral ? Pinstripes made up his panorama . The other slurpers were all like him . Commuters . Men who traveled to and from their wives , their children , " the Office . " Men with secret lives in a foreign land : the city . Men who got off on eating oysters , who delayed going home by having yet another round of drinks . They all stood in a row at the bar the way they would stand at a row of urinals . Each in his private world . " Aaach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips . His mouth was flooded by ocean . <p> Delays , delays . A lifetime full of delays . Hershleder the procrastinator , the putter-offer . Hershleder of the term papers started the night before , the grant proposals typed once into the computer , the postmarks fudged by the hospital 's friendly postmaster . He was the kind of man to leave things to the last minute , to torture himself every moment that he did not attend to what needed attending to , his tasks , but also the type always to get them done . While in his heart he lusted after irresponsibility , he was never bad enough . Chicken-shit . A loser . <p> Hershleder 's neighbor at the bar was reading The New York Times . <p> " Hey , Mister , " said Hershleder , sounding like he was seven . " Would you mind letting me look at the C section ? " Now he spoke like a gynecologist . <p> The neighbor slid the paper over without even glancing up . <p> Hershleder turned to the book review . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of the sucker . A picture ; why a picture ? Hershleder thought . It was n't even Josephson 's book . He was just a translator , that schlep was . <p> Josephson had not fared well over time , although to be fair , the reproduction was kind of grainy . A hook nose . A high forehead . He still looked brainy . That forehead hung over his eyes like an awning at a fancy club . Hershleder read the article for himself . <p> A 1,032-page study of the Nazi gas chambers has been published .... The study is by Jacques LeClerc , a chemist who began his work doubting that the Holocaust even took place .... The book , written in French , ( translated by that bald rat Josephson ! ) ... presents as proof , based entirely on technical analysis of the camps , that the Holocaust was every bit as monstrous and sweeping as survivors have said .... It is also a personal story of a scientific discovery during which , as Mr. LeClerc writes in a postscript , he was converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exterminationist . What a hell of an appellative . Hershleder shook his head , in public , at the Oyster Bar , at no one in particular . Exterminationist . Is that what he himself was ? His beloved mother , Adela Hershleder , just a child , along with her sister and her mother , her father recently dead of typhus , smuggled out of Germany on Kristallnacht . His mother 's mother lost six brothers and sisters in Hitler 's crematoria . And the friends , the extended family , even the neighbors they did n't like  --  all gone , gone . Hershleder 's grandfather Chaim and his grandfather 's brother , Abe , came to this country from Austria as refugees after World War I , the sole survivors of the sweeping tragedies of Europe that did away with their entire extended family . <p> And heerre ... was Hershleder , the beneficiary of all that compounded survival ; Hershleder the educated , the privileged , the beloved , the doctor ! Hershleder the first generation New York Jew , Hershleder the bar mitzvahed , the assimilated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Christmas , bacon in their breakfast , mayonnaise spread across their Wonder Bread , the daughter who once asked him if calling a person a Jew was really just another way to insult him . <p> He was lucky ; his ancestors were not . What could you do ? Is n't this the crux of it all ( the history of civilization ) : those of us who are lucky juxtaposed against those of us who are not ? <p> Mindy and Lori , his sisters , married with children , each active in her own temple , one out on Long Island , one on the Upper West Side . IN , his father , retired now , remarried now , donating his time to the Jewish Home for the Blind . Were they any more Jewish than he was ? Was n't it true , what his own mother had told him , that what mattered in life was not religion per se , but that one strived to be a good person ? Was n't he , Hershleder  --  the researcher and , on Tuesdays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the father , the husband , the lawn mower , the moviegoer ( he did show that bag lady a good time ) , the friend to Josephson ( at least in theory )  --  a good person ? <p> My God , thought Hershleder , just imagine being this chemist , this LeClerc , having the courage to disprove the very tenets upon which you 've built your life . But Hershleder knew this kind , he had seen them before : LeClerc 's accomplishments wee probably less about bravery than they were about obsessive compulsion : LeClerc was probably a man who practiced a strict adherence to facts , to science . After all , Hershleder had spent much of his adult life doing research . You let the data make the decisions for you . You record what you observe . You synthesize , yes , you interpret ; but you do n't theorize , create out of your own imagination needs and desires . He knew him , LeClerc , LeClerc the compulsive , the truth-teller . They were alike these two men , rational , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not the ephemeral mumbo jumbo of politicians , philosophers , poets . <p> Hershleder and LeClerc : they told the truth , when they were able , when it stared them in the face . <p> Hershleder folded up the paper and left it on the counter , its owner , his neighbor , having vanished in the direction of the New Haven Line some time ago . Paid up and exited the comforts of the Oyster Bar and headed out into the festering subterranean world . He stopped at the florist to pick up those daisies , two dozen , a field of them , a free-floating urban meadow . He held the bouquet like a cheerleader 's pom-pom in his hands . <p> " Daisies are wildflowers , " said the florist when he wrapped them up , those hothouse posies , in a crinkly paper cone . What did he think , that Hershleder was a poster child ? He 'd been to summer camp , away to college . Did n't he live in the suburbs and have a wife who cultivated daisies of her own ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bright , so fresh , so clean , petals as white as laundry detergent . <p> As he made his way to Track 11 , Hershleder had a musical association : " Daisy , Daisy , give me your answer true . " He had a poetic association : " She loves me , she loves me not . " He had a visual association : the daisy stickers on the leaded glass windows that faced his yard , the plastic daisy treads that his mother had stuck to the bottom of his bathtub so that he , Hershleder , her precious boy-child , the third born and most prized , would n't slip , hit his head and drown . The big bright patent-leather daisies that dressed the thongs of his own daughter 's dress-up sandals . The golden yolk , the pinky white of Itty 's eyes when she 'd been crying . <p> Hershleder walked through the vaulted , starred , amphitheater of Grand Central Station with a sensual garden , his human history , flowering bitterly in his hands . <p> " Smoke , " hissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thai stick , dust , coke . " The young man stood outside Track 11 . Hershleder saw this dealer there , this corrupter of the young and not so young , this drug pusher , almost every day for months and months . Hershleder nodded at him , started down the ramp to the train tracks , then stopped . He had been a good boy . At Bronx Science he had smoked pot , at Cornell he 'd done magic mushrooms once in awhile at a Dead show  --  then usually spent the rest of the night in the bathroom throwing up . For the most part , he 'd played it safe ; a little blow on a pom night or some graduation , but no acid , no ups , no downs , ( well , that was n't true , there were bennies in med school , valiums after ) , no needles in the arm , no track marks . No long velvety nights of swirling hazy rock songs . Drugwise , he was practically a virgin . Had n't this gone on long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much ? " asked Hershleder . <p> " For what ? " said Mr. Black Concert T-shirt <p> For what ? For what ? <p> " Heroin ? " asked Hershleder , with hope . <p> Mr. Black Concert T-shirt looked away in disgust . <p> " Pot ? " asked Hershleder , humbly , in his place . <p> " Smoke , " hissed the young man , " Thai stick , dust , coke . " <p> " Thai stick , " said Hershleder . Decisively . " Thai fucking stick , " said Hershleder the reckless , the bon vivant . <p> And then , even though he was in danger of missing his train ( again ) Hershleder went back into the lobby of the station and officially bought cigarettes . He bought Merit Ultra Lights , thought better of it , backtracked to the kiosk and traded in the Merits for a pack of Salems . <p> The john was small enough that if you were to sit your knees would be in your armpits and your elbows in your ears . Hershleder and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asiatic ( the Thai stick ) . The chemical smell of toilets on trains and airplanes permeated all that steam . The resultant odor was strong enough to etherize an elephant , but Hershleder the rebel was nose-blind to it . He was wasted . <p> The MetroNorth rumbled through the tunnel . Outside the scenery was so familiar Hershleder had it memorized . First the rude surprise of 125th Street , all those broken windows , empty eye holes , the flash of grafitti , of murals , loud paint . The decals of curtains and cozy cats curled up on cheery sills pasted to crumbling bricked-up tenements , the urban renewal . Then onward , the Bronx , Riverdale ; Spuyten Duyvil . The scramble of weedy green , the lumber yards , factories , houses that line the train tracks in the suburbs . At night , all of this would be in shadow ; what he 'd see would be the advertisements for Cats , for Big Mac attacks , for Newport cigarettes : usually of a man gleefully dumping a bucket of something over an equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform waiting for the train to carry her home two towns away . A couple of emasculated teenagers without driver 's licenses . A spaced-out commuter who had stumbled off at the wrong station . Hershleder knew this route by heart . <p> In the train car itself , there was always the risk of running into one of his neighbors , or worse yet the aging parents of a chum from college . Better to hang out in that safe smoky toilet pondering the meaning of life , his humble existence . He was stoned for the first time in years . Drunken synapse fired awkwardly to drunken synapse . His edges were rounded , his reflexes dulled . The ghosts that lived inside him spiraled around in concentric circles . Hershleder 's interior buzzed . His head hung heavy off his neck , rested in the field of daises . A petal went up his nose , pollen dusted his mouth . He could n't really think at all  --  he was full to the brim with nothing . <p> It was perfect . <p> " Laaarchmont , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . <p> Hershleder lit up a cigarette and coughed up a chunk of lung . Larchmont . The Station . A mile and a half from Casa Hershleder , a mile and a half from Itty and the kids , a mile and a half from his home and future heart failures . His eyes roved the Park and Ride . Had he driven his car this morning or had Itty dropped him off at the train ? Had he called for a cab , hitched a ride with a neighbor ? Where was that beat-up Mazda ? His most recent history dissolved like a photograph in water , a dream upon awakening , a computer screen when the power suddenly shuts down . It receded from his inner vision . Must have been the weed ... It really knocked him out . <p> Good shit , thought Hershleder . <p> He decided to walk What was a mile and a half ? He was in the prime of his life . Besides , Hershleder could n't arrive home like this , stoned , in front of his innocent children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enought to sober him ; it would be a head-clearing , emotional cup of coffee . <p> Larchmont . Westchester , New York . One curvy road segueing into another . A dearth of street lights . The Tudor houses loomed like haunted mansions . They sat so large on their tiny lots , they swelled over their property lines the way a stout man 's waist swells above his belt . A yuppie dog , a dalmatian , nosed its way across a lawn and accompanied Hershleder 's shuffling gait . Hershleder would have reached down to pat its spotty head if he could have , but his arms were too full of daisies . He made a mental note to give in to Itty ; she 'd been begging him to agree to get a pup for the kids . There had been dogs when Hershleder was a child . Three of them . At different times . He had had a mother who could n't say no to anything . He had had a mother who was completely overwhelmed . The longest a dog had lasted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept giving those dogs away . Three dogs , three children . Was there some wish fulfillment involved in her casting them aside ? His favorite one had been called Snoopy . A beagle . His sister Mindy , that original thinker , had been the one to name her . <p> Hershleder remembered coming home from camp one summer to find that Snoopy was missing . His mother had sworn up and down that she had given the dog to a farm , a farm in western Pennsylvania . Much better for the dog , said Mrs. Hershleder , than being cooped up in some tiny apartment . Better for the dog , thought Hershleder now , some twenty-eight years later , better for the dog ! What about me , a dogless boy cooped up in some tiny apartment ! But his mother was dead , she was dead ; there was no use in raging at a dead mother . Hershleder the motherless , the dogless , walked the streets of Larchmont . His buzz was beginning to wear off . <p> Why neurology ? Mrs. Hershleder had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Family practice ? Dovidil , do n't make the same mistakes I made , a life devoted to half-lives , a life frozen in motion . But Hershleder had been drawn to the chronic ward . Paralysis , coma . He could not stand to watch a patient suffer , the kick and sweat , the scream of life battling stupidly for continuation . If he had to deal with people  --  and was n't that what a doctor does , a doctor deals with people  --  he preferred people in a vegetative state , he preferred them non-cognizant . What had attracted him in the first place had been the literature , the questions : what was death ? What was life , after all ? Did the answers to these lie , as Hershleder believed , not in the heart but in the brain ? He liked to deal in inquiries ; he did n't like to deal in statements . It was natural then that he 'd be turned on by research . Books and libraries , the heady smell of ink on paper . He 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run off things for the teacher . He 'd stand close to the Rexograph machine , getting giddy , greedily inhaling those toxic vapors . He 'd walk back slowly to his classroom , his nose buried deep in a pile of freshly printed pages . <p> Hershleder was not taken with the delivering of babies , the spreading of legs , the searching speculum , the bloody afterbirth like a display of raw ground meat . But the brain , the brain , that fluted , folded mushroom , that lovely intricate web of thought and tissue and talent and dysfunction , of arteries and order . The delicate weave of neurons , that thrilling spinal cord . All that communication , all those nerves sending and receiving orders . A regular switchboard . Music for his mind . <p> A jogger passed him on the right , his gait strong and steady . Hershleder 's dalmatian abandoned him for the runner . <p> Hershleder turned down Fairweather Drive . He stepped over a discarded red tricycle . He noticed that the Fishmans had a blue Jag in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nemesis . Charlie Fishman could run faster , hit harder . No matter that Hershleder 's own boy could speak in numbers -a = 1 b = 2 , for example , when Hershleder arrived home at night the kid said : " 8-9 4-1-4 " ( translation : Hi Dad ! )  --  the kid was practically a savant , a genius ! So what , the Fishman boy could kick harder , draw blood faster in a fight . Could Charlie Fishman bring tears to his own father 's eyes by saying , " 9 12-15-22-5 25-15-21 " when Fishman 's father tucked him in at night ? ( Even though it had taken Hershleder seven minutes and a pad and pencil to decode the obvious . ) Charlie Fishman had just beaten out Hershleder 's Jonathan for the lead in the second-grade play . The Fishman father was a famous nephrologist . He commuted to New Haven every morning on the highway , shooting like a star in that blue Jag out of the neighborhood , against the traffic , in the opposite direction . Hershleder admired the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It glowed royally against the darkness . <p> The jogger passed him again , on the right . The dalmatian loped after the runner , his spotted tongue hanging from his mouth . The jogger must have circled around the long circuitous block in record time . A powerful mother-fucker . Bearded . And young . Younger than Hershleder . The jogger had a ponytail . It sailed in the current of his own making . His legs were strong and bare . Ropey , tendoned . From where he stood , Hershleder admired them . Then he moved himself up the block to his own stone Tudor . <p> Casa Hershleder . It was written in fake Spanish tile on the front walk , a gift from his sisters . Hershleder walked up the slate steps and hesitated on his own front porch . Sometimes it felt like only an act of courage could get him to turn the knob and go inside . So much tumult awaited . Various children : on their marks , getting set , ready to run , to hurl themselves into his arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumped  --  dressed in an undulation of circling Indian shmatas  --  hungry for connection , attention , the conversation of a living , breathing adult . Itty , with tiny clumps of clay still lodged like bird eggs in the curly fed nest of her hair . Itty with the silt on her arms , the gray slip-like slippers on her bare feet . Itty , his wife , the potter . <p> By this point , the daisies were half-dead . They 'd wilted in the heat . Hershleder lay them in a pile on his front shrub then lowered himself onto a slate step seat . If he angled his vision past the O'Keefe 's mock turret , he would surely see some stars . <p> The steam of summer nights , the sticky breath of the trees and their exhalation of oxygen , the buzz of the mosquitos and the cicadas , the sweaty breeze , the rubbing of his suit legs against his thighs . The moon above the O'Keefe 's turret was high , high , high . <p> The jogger came around again . Angled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flushed with all that good clean high-octane blood that is the result of honest American exertion . He looked young  --  far younger than Hershleder , but had n't Hershleder noted this before ? Must be wanting to know the time , or in need of a glass of water , a bathroom , a phone , Hershleder thought . The jogger was jogging right towards him . <p> In a leap of blind and indiscriminate affection the dalmatian bounded past the runner and collided with Hershleder 's head , his body , his lap . David was stunned for a second , then revived by the wet slap of the dog 's tongue . He was showered with love and saliva . " Hey , " said Hershleder . " Hey there , Buster . Watch it . " Hershleder fended off the beast by petting him , by bowing under to all that animal emotion . The dalmatian wagged the bottom half of his spinal column like a dissected worm would , it had a life all its own . His tail beat the air like a wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an internal organ . " Hey , Buster , down . " Hershleder 's arms were full of dog . <p> The jogger jogged right past them . He wiped his feet on Hershleder 's welcome mat . He opened Hershleder 's door and entered Hershleder 's house . He closed Hershleder 's door behind him . There was the click of the lock Hershleder had installed himself . That old bolt sliding into that old socket . <p> What was going on ? What was going on around here ? <p> Buster was in love . He took to Hershleder like a bitch in heat , this same fancy mutt that had abandoned him earlier for the runner . A fickle fellow , thought Hershleder , a familiar fickle fellow . <p> " Hey , " said Hershleder . " Hey , " he called out . But it was too late . The runner had already disappeared inside his house . <p> The night was blue . The lawns deep blue-green , the asphalt blue-black , the trees almost purple . Jaundiced yellow light , like flames on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the Coen 's , from the second floor family room , a T.V. flickered like a weak pulse . Most of the neighborhood was dark . Dark , hot , blue and yellow . Throbbing like a bruise . <p> A car backfired in the distance . Buster took off like a shot . <p> Hershleder sat on his front step feeling used . He was like a college girl left in the middle of a one-night stand . The dog 's breath was still hot upon his face . His clothes were damp and wrinkled . The smell of faded passion clung to him . His hair  --  what was left of it  --  felt matted . He 'd been discarded . Thrown-over . What could he do ? <p> Stand up , storm into the house , demand : What 's the meaning of this intrusion ? Call the cops ? Were Itty and the kids safe inside , locked up with that handsome , half-crazed stranger ? Was it a local boy , home on vacation from college , an art student perhaps , hanging around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge ? The possibilities were endless . Hershleder contemplated the endless possibilities for a while . <p> Surely , he should right himself , climb his own steps , turn his key in his lock , at least ring his own bell , as it were . Surely , Hershleder should do something to claim what was his : " If I am not for me , who will be for me ? If I am not for mine , who will be for mine ? " Surely , he should stop quoting , stop questioning , and get on with the messy thrill of homeownership . After all , his wife , his children were inside . <p> The jogger was inside . <p> Hershleder and LeClerc , they told the truth when it stared them in the face . In the face ! Which was almost enough but was n't enough , right then at that exact and awful moment to stop him , the truth was n't , not from taking his old key out of his pocket and jamming it again and again at a lock it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this unyielding frustration , to stop him from ringing the bell , again and again , waking his children , disturbing his neighbor . Which was n't enough to stop him , the confusion , the shouting that ensued , that led Itty his wife to say : " Please , Sweetheart , " to the jogger ( Please , Sweetheart ! ) and usher him aside , that pony-tailed bearded athlete who was far , far younger than Hershleder had ever been , younger than was biologically possible . <p> She sat on the slate steps , Itty , her knees spread , the Indian shmata pulled discreetly down between them . She ran her silt-stained hands through her dusty strawberry cloud of hair . There were dark , dirty half-moons beneath her broken fingernails . She was golden eyed and frustrated and terribly pained . She was beautiful , Itty , at her best really when she was most perplexed , her expression forming and reforming like a kaleidescope of puzzled and passionate emotion , when she patiently and for the thousandth time explained to him , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home , that the locks had been changed for this very reason . He had to stop coming around here , upsetting her , upsetting the children , that it was time , it was time , Dave , to take a good look at himself ; when all Hershleder was capable of looking at was her , was Itty , dusty , plump and sweaty , sexy-sexy Itty , his wife , his wife , sitting with him on the stoop of his house in his neighborhood , while his children cowered inside . <p> Until finally , exhausted , ( Hershleder had exhausted her ) Itty threatened to call the police if he did not move , and it was her tiredness , her sheer collapsibility that forced Hershleder to his feet  --  for was n't being tired one thing Itty went on and on about that Hershleder could finally relate to  --  that pushed him to see the truth , to assess the available data and to head out alone and ashamed and apologetic to his suburban slip of a sidewalk , down the mile and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would take him to the city and to the medical student housing he 'd wrangled out of the hospital , away from everything he 'd built , everything he knew and could count on , out into everything unknown , unreliable and yet to be invented . <p>
