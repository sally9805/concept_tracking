Section : Defense &; Technology <p> THE GULF WAR was a wake-up call for ballistic-missile defense . With Iraq 's air force knocked out on the first day , ballistic missiles were the only way it could attack the territory of the nations arrayed against it , especially Saudi Arabia . A single Iraqi ballistic missile accounted for 20 per cent of all U.S. combat fatalities in that war . <p> Iraq also sent missiles raining down on Israeli cities , in hopes of provoking Israel 's entry into the war and the subsequent defection of Arab states unwilling to be part of a coalition including Israel . This strategy undoubtedly would have succeeded had the United States not deployed Patriot missiles to defend Israel . Despite hundreds of sorties , U.S. aircraft simply could not find the mobile launchers from which Iraq launched its missiles . Not a single one was destroyed from the air . Although not designed to defend urban areas , the Patriots were our only available countermeasure , and they knocked down a sufficient number of ballistic missiles to defeat the Iraqi strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We could face even more serious threats in the future . By the end of the decade , we could see over 20 countries with ballistic missiles , 9 with nuclear weapons , 10 with biological weapons , and up to 30 with chemical weapons . <p> The threat presented by ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction can arise quickly . While it takes a long time to develop such weapons from scratch , they can be easily transferred from a state already possessing them . China has supplied ballistic missiles to Syria and Pakistan . North Korea has offered Libya and Iran its new Nodong I missile with a range of over 600 miles . From those countries a Nodong could reach cities in France , Italy , Greece , and Turkey ; from North Korea itself , the missile could reach Japan . North Korea is developing two missiles with ranges that unofficial sources place as exceeding 1,200 and 2,000 miles , respectively . The latter may put cities in Alaska and Hawaii within reach of North Korea . <p> It is not just that ballistic-missile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states can emerge with little warning . Who would have thought in the fall of 1989 that we would be at war with Iraq just one year later ? In 1987 , China began delivering its 1,700-mile-range CSS-2 missile to Saudi Arabia . If its current government were replaced by a radical fundamentalist regime , Saudi Arabia could pose a direct threat to Israel . <p> FORTUNATELY , our nation seems to have learned the lessons of the Gulf War when it comes to defending our overseas troops and our allies against ballistic missiles . A broad consensus supports congressional funding for such theater missile defense ( TMD ) systems . An upgrade to the Patriot ( PAC 3 ) will enhance protection of critical targets by the late 1990s . A Theater High Altitude Air Defense ( THAAD ) system will protect broad geographic areas ( including both military forces and cities ) after the year 2000 . A TMD system on Navy Aegis ships ( the Navy Lower Tier ) will protect coastal installations and military forces going ashore beginning in the late 1990s . We can dramatically enhance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Brilliant Eyes ' ' ) . <p> But the lessons of the Gulf War have not been learned when it comes to defending the American people at home . Put simply , the United States has no means to defend its own territory against ballistic missiles . The long-range missiles required to fly over the oceans that protect our shores will fly too fast to be intercepted by Patriot , THAAD , or Navy Lower Tier . While research is under way , no defense against such missiles currently is being built . <p> The risk that we may someday face such missiles is real . It is true that their longer range makes their development technically more challenging . But the risk of transfer is much the same as for shorter-range missiles . Japan , India , and Brazil all have or are developing ballistic missiles for launching space satellites . Russia may sell a space launch ' version of its most modern ballistic missile ( the SS-25 ) . China may sell similar space-launch versions of its missiles . While they are sold for space launch , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver weapons . <p> We should not wait until such threats actually materialize . The National Security Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has proposed deploying ground-based interceptors at one or more sites in the United States . This would cost an estimated $5 to 15 billion , and the sites could begin operation in 4 to 7 years . <p> Interim protection could be achieved by following the recommendation of the Heritage Foundation 's Team B report . It suggests taking the Navy 's more advanced TMD system ( the Navy Upper Tier ) and optimizing its capability against longer-range ballistic missiles . This would take advantage of the nearly $50 billion already invested in building the fleet of Aegis ships . At an additional cost estimated at $2 to $3 billion , this approach could provide protection to the American people beginning in three or four years . <p> Although this is not a return to Ronald Reagan 's Strategic Defense Initiative , which envisioned a substantial defense against Soviet ballistic missiles , it is a modest program providing a thin layer of protection against the ballistic missiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who suggest that this approach is a return to Star Wars ' are either woefully uninformed or engaged in willful mischaracterization . <p> WHAT are the principal arguments against this self-evidently sensible approach ? There are six : <p> 1 . We have more critical priorities . Social Security , education , and health care must come first . <p> We are currently engaged in an unprecedented debate on national priorities and the role of the Federal Government . But certainly if there is one pre- eminently federal function , it is to defend the country against external attack . Few modes of attack could be more devastating than ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction . What could be a higher priority for our national leadership than defense against such an attack ? Especially when the dollar amounts are relatively modest . <p> 2 . No one would dare attack America . We would retaliate with overwhelming military force . This will deter any potential adversary from attacking us . <p> Maybe  --  or maybe not . We have seen fanatical terrorist groups and even fanatical national leaders ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . And on the other hand , our own actions are by no means certain . Would we really retaliate if a single ballistic missile armed with only a conventional warhead ( not a weapon of mass destruction ) struck a single American city doing little damage ? But would not such an attack have a devastating impact on public willingness to risk further attacks  --  attacks which the next time could involve chemical , biological , or even nuclear weapons ? <p> The risk is of blackmail , of a hostile state invading its neighbors and telling the United States to stay out or risk an attack on its own cities . Would we have come to the aid of Kuwait if Saddam Hussein could have made such a threat ? Would we come to the aid even of a close ally like Israel ? The danger is that we will be deterred  --  from defending our interests , from standing by our allies . <p> 3 . There are easier ways to deliver weapons of mass destruction . Such weapons could be hidden in commercial aircraft flying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containers . A nuclear weapon could be fashioned Oklahoma City- style into a truck bomb . Chemical weapons could be discharged Tokyo-style into subways . Biological weapons could be even easier to disseminate . <p> But why is this an argument against ballistic-missile defense ? We make great efforts to cope with these other kinds of threats . We have anti-aircraft weapons to shoot down hostile aircraft . We suspend commercial flights from potentially hostile countries . The immigration and customs services monitor people and goods coming into the United States . Law-enforcement agencies seek to identify terrorist groups and to step in before they act . Our tools may be woefully inadequate , but we make considerable efforts . <p> Not so in defending the country against ballistic-missile attack . We agreed not to deploy a national defense against long-range ballistic missiles when we entered into the Anti-Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) Treaty with the Soviet Union in 1972 . That we can not fully defend the nation against other kinds of threats is no reason to do nothing about long-range ballistic missiles . Especially since this is an area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building defenses will harm our efforts to prevent the spread of these weapons , by suggesting that we are not serious about stopping it . If other nations do not believe we are serious , they will not be either . <p> But we have to be realistic . The ability to build ballistic missiles and the weapons they might carry has already spread to several countries hostile to us . To show that we can defend ourselves against these weapons will actually strengthen our efforts to discourage their spread . For defenses will deprive these weapons of the potentially decisive political and military benefit that now makes them so irresistibly attractive . By reducing their value , we reduce the incentive to acquire them . <p> 5 . Building defenses will unsettle our allies . We will be protecting ourselves while leaving them exposed . This will confirm their worst fears about U.S. isolationism on the one hand or unilateral U.S. interventionism on the other . <p> Nonsense . Our development of defenses can make a significant contribution to the global effort of like-minded states to deal with the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Patriots available to Saudi Arabia , Israel , and Turkey in the Gulf War . We have encouraged our allies to build their own defenses while offering to include Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union in those efforts . On June 16 , 1992 , President Bush and President Yeltsin agreed that their two countries should work with other interested states on a concept for a global defense , to protect the world community from the tyranny of ballistic missiles . <p> 6 . We will violate the ABM Treaty and provoke a crisis with Russia . The Russians will read our building of defenses as a signal that we regard them as an enemy , returning our relations to the days of Cold War confrontation . It will make impossible any further reduction in the number of nuclear forces possessed by the two sides . For the Russians will fear that at lower numbers the United States could build defenses that would neutralize the whole Russian nuclear arsenal while leaving Russia still vulnerable to our nuclear weapons . <p> The truth is that the ABM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to prevent massive nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union by ensuring that both sides would be annihilated in the process . But the Cold War is over . We no longer fear a massive Russian nuclear attack . The ABM Treaty meanwhile prevents both the United States and Russia from dealing with a common national-security problem . <p> Both nations must worry about ballistic missiles launched from other potentially hostile nations . Indeed , the threat is greater for Russia , since most of the countries of concern ( Iraq , Iran , North Korea ) are closer to its borders . U.S. Government officials have pointed this out to the Russian military on numerous occasions , and they agree . <p> It is time for both the United States and Russia to move beyond the ABM Treaty . Contrary to common belief , the ABM Treaty did not prohibit the parties from deploying anti-ballistic missile defenses on their respective homelands . They retained the right under the Treaty to build limited defenses at two sites ( later reduced by agreement to one ) . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union built and Russia continues to maintain an ABM system to defend Moscow . <p> What both nations need now , however , is not limited defenses of specific sites but a thin layer of protection for the entire country . Whether our version was based on the Navy Upper Tier or on a limited ground-based deployment , these defenses would not have sufficient technical capability or sufficient numbers to defeat the Russian nuclear deterrent at levels even lower than those negotiated to date . <p> The United States should begin to build its limited defenses unconstrained by the ABM treaty . At the same time , we should assist Russia ( and other former Soviet republics ) in building similar defenses as part of a broader cooperation with friends and allies on a global protection system . In due course , Russia should adopt our view that the ABM Treaty must not be allowed to stand in the way of such deployments . If it refuses to do so , however , we must build our defenses even if it means withdrawing from the Treaty altogether . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. homeland with a ballistic missile , the American people will simply not accept the explanation that a 25-year-old treaty with a nation that no longer exists prevented our national leaders from defending them . <p> CARTOONS <p> By STEPHEN J.
