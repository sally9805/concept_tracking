The road doglegs near the river there . The bend comes on you suddenly , especially at night . The road itself is a long , uneven trace of earth that seems to end completely in a dark forest of pine . Then , at the very last moment , you see the rest of the road . The old man had driven that road as both man and boy , but this fall morning , an hour before daylight , he missed the turn and slid off into a ditch . He said nothing . It was a shallow ditch and he spun out of it without stopping completely . He had been driving too fast since they left town and the man with him , who out of respect said nothing aloud , said to himself : Dammit , he is going to kill us both for the sake of a few squirrels . The two men had hunted together for ten years now . They hunted doves and squirrels for fun and deer with great seriousness , fun of another kind . Sometimes they hunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends for ten years , too . That was how long he had been married to the old man 's daughter . Ten years is a long time in any man 's life , and now he could not find a good way to tell the old man : Slow down ! This is not that important . You are not acting like yourself , and the world will not come to an end if we are not in the woods by daylight . " That 's part of it . " That 's what the old man would say . He knew that . The old man never complained and he did n't like others to . He had worked his way out of poverty as a boy , fought in a World War , and had been suffering from a rare blood disease for several years now . Yet , when something was less than perfect , the old man shrugged and said , " That 's part of it , " if he said anything at all . It was the most important thing he would ever learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it yet . The two men had been on the edge of the big woods when they missed the turn . It was 3 or maybe 4 miles to the faded pineboard house where they left the truck . No one had lived there for many years but sometimes hunters used the house . It had an artesian well with warm , sweet water bubbling from an iron pipe . As they took turns drinking from it the old man said he would hunt southward through the River Swamp . He knew it better . The young man could hunt the riverbank and they would meet by noon where Buck Ridge runs to the river . That would be a long morning 's walk . It was dark and absolutely quiet when the young man came to the river . It was so completely quiet he could hear the river flowing . The deep , wide river was named for an old Indian chief . The man was part Indian himself , though his hair , eyes , and skin were not dark like his father 's . Nor could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man admitted he saw and heard things in the woods that others did not . It was like a secret door in a house you lived in as a child . You knew where it was and how to open it , but you were never allowed to show it to anyone else . You could only tell them about it . They had to find it on their own . The young man leaned against a tree in the darkness to listen and wait for dawn . He loaded his gun quietly and watched the sky . There was a glow of red through the woods , as of a distant fire , but the woods themselves were dark . When they began to turn from black to gray the fire disappeared . Before he could see the limbs of the trees he heard the boom of a shotgun rolling through the swamp , and he knew the old man had killed his first squirrel of the day . It would be a small one . The old man liked them young and tender and slowly cooked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from the west . He could not hear squirrels in the trees but he could hear the wind in the treetops . They were very tall trees , including hickory , gum , cypress , pine , and many kinds of oak . They had not been cut since before the old man was born , and it took a .22 or a magnum load of No. 6 shot to reach the squirrels when they ran up into the tops to hide . Sometimes you could n't reach them at all , but they would come to the ground to feed if you kept yourself hidden and quiet . The old man had taught him that . He had been hunting squirrels since he was big enough to shoulder his father 's old .22 pump , ten or eleven , he guessed . When he was twenty-six the old man had taken him to these same big woods and shown him how patience killed more than haste . That above all did not square with the old man 's behavior this morning , and he knew something was wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that had been running away on the ground and another as it ran spiraling up the trunk of a huge red oak tree . One was a sow and the other a full-grown boar , or what the old man called a " Bo " squirrel . He knew damn well who would find the Bo squirrel sitting on his plate come dinner , but he hoped maybe they could fry them or stew them with dumplings this time . His wife , the old man 's only daughter , had once joked that the way her father cooked squirrels with greens made them look like dead rats floating in seaweed . He had never been able to get that image out of his mind . The sky had clouded over completely now and it began to rain . It was too warm for rain gear and the young man had left it in the truck . He rarely wore it anyway . Neither he nor the old man had ever minded getting wet . The blood disease made it worse for the old man because water , even bathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him irritable , but he rarely let that or anything else slow him down . He was a strange old man , sure of himself , yet so much like a boy . It did not rain hard but it rained steadily , and the woods were wet and dark . The young man backed away from the river , though he could see it through the trees . The squirrels were holed up in their nests . That could mean anything , but he knew if he found them feeding soon it would mean the rain had set in . Thanks to the old man they had been invited to an afternoon dove hunt and the rain would ruin that . The trick was to make the best of the morning . The young man found plenty of nests but saw no squirrels . He had shoot into a nest once when he was very young . It had been a perfectly clear autumn afternoon and the nest had been in the only tree in the middle of a huge field . The nest should not have been where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did . It was the kind of thing you knew was wrong as soon as you 'd done it , and it made him sick to think of it even now . There were better ways to get squirrels out of a nest , and the old man had taught him some good ones . In the River Swamp there are great , long vines , as thick as the lower part of a deer 's leg , that grow up into the tops of some of the tallest trees . There were no such vines where the young man had hunted as a boy , but here you could sometimes find a tree with vines growing up into the nest and you 'd shake and pull on the vines until squirrels came out . Then you 'd shoot them . But there were not many nest trees with vines , and he had to cover a great deal of territory to find them . When it was warm like this you had to walk with your eyes on the ground and pause every few steps to check the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make themselves look like a pile of leaves , and it was difficult to see them unless they moved . The young man had placed his foot within striking distance of three poisonous snakes in his lifetime already : a small timber rattler when he was a boy ; a water moccasin that he 'd narrowly missed as he stepped out of a boat on a hot day ; and a copperhead as thick as his forearm that he had thought was dead and had stepped over as casually as you would step across a threshold , only to turn and see it crawl away . Those were the ones he knew about ; the ones he had seen . When they had first started hunting together the old man had been very critical of the way the young man moved through the woods so quickly , with his eyes on the treetops . The man 's own father had taught him to shoot , but he had worked 70 and 80 hours a week and had little time for hunting . Most of what the young man knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time to reteach him some of it . The young man found six small squirrels eating hickory nuts on the ground . They were in a dry , sheltered slough that looked like a huge brown bowl studded with cypress knees . There were still some cypress trees near the river , but many of them had been cut for lumber . He killed two of the squirrels there with two quick shots . He tried to watch where the others went while placing the two dead squirrels in the pouch of his hunting vest . The vest and the rest of his clothes were soaked , and water spilled from the brim of his hat when he moved his head . He picked one of the squirrels to follow . Each time it stopped he would mark the tree and walk to it . It was a slow way to hunt . The squirrels led him farther away from the river and it took him most of an hour to get close enough to shot without having the squirrel jump to another tree . When he had killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man saw that he was lost ; not badly , but he would need his compass to find his way back . The old man had shown him how the low ridges and shallow sloughs all led to the river . But they also led away from the river , and on a day like this he doubted if even the old man could the tell the difference . He heard the old man 's gun boom twice more as he made his way to Buck Ridge . This ridge was only slightly larger than any of the dozens of other small ridges in the area , but it bordered a big cypress slough right on the river that you could not miss . He must not have heard one shot because the old man had four squirrels and was already skinning them . The old man said it had rained all morning , and he thought the dove hunt would still be on because the doves would be hungry . Maybe they would not fly in the rain , but he wanted to be there if they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the squirrels quickly and easily . It was something he did well and he liked to do it . Using a very sharp pocket knife , he cut the feet off and made a small slit around the tail . Then he placed his foot on the squirrel 's tail , and by grasping the rear legs , peeled the skin up over the head . It looked simple , but was hard to do correctly . The old man could skin a deer or rabbit with the same easy skill . When he was skinning the last squirrel , the old man slipped and stabbed himself in the knee . It was a deep wound and it bled for a long time . It bled much more than normal because the old man 's blood disease had become suddenly worse . He did not know that then , nor did he know that the wound would never heal properly or that he would never hunt again . He insisted that the young man take him home and go to the dove hunt alone . The young man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not argue with him now . He did as the old man wished . When the young man arrived at the dove field , the other hunters were surprised to see him there alone . They asked about the old man , and he told them the old man had hunted all morning but had gone home to rest now , and even his heart , he did not know how very soon that would be true . <p>
