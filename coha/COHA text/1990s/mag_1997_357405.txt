Diana Spencer was nothing like as gifted as Judy Garland , nowhere near as sexy as Marilyn Monroe , but like those equally doomed young women , she had the power to touch us  --  that is to say , if one examines the response dispassionately , to make us feel sorry for her . She was a terribly mixed-up kid . We felt close to her ( when we were not infuriated by her ) because she represented in herself so many of the worries our own children are likely to foist upon us  --  disappointing school grades , anorexia and bulimia , unsuitable young men , a tendency to show off , a preoccupation with clothes and publicity , a rotten marriage , single motherhood and trouble with the in-laws . <P> Sometimes she went too far , as children do , and we were fed up with her . Sometimes we felt that she was deceiving us . She doth protest too much , we occasionally thought , when she complained about the attentions of the paparazzi . When , after so many years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last so squalidly in that underpass , some of us for a moment thought , as the Friar thought about Romeo and Juliet , " These violent delights have violent ends ... " <P> But she touched us  --  that 's the thing . As the Friar went on to remark , " So light a foot will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint . " She was so lovely to look at . She appeared to be so shy . Like all our children , she seemed to float above the drab and everlasting flintiness of our ordinary lives . Time and again we found ourselves ready to forgive her , just as in the end we always give in and send our wayward offspring another check to pay the telephone bill ; and we did it as always with a shrug of the shoulders that was part affection , part exasperation , part amusement , part forgiveness  --  and part pity . Even a doubter like me , when the news arrived from Paris that Sunday morning , felt the tears come to my eyes . <P> But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirrored our personal anxieties , and the perennial anxieties of the young  --  for it is hard to believe she was 36 years old . She was truly a cliche of the age itself . Much of the angst of this troubled fin de siecle was indexed in her brief life . Wars and poverty , sickness and prejudice , uncertainty and despair  --  this daughter of an earl , this mother of a putative King of England was paradoxically familiar with them all : and when the end came , it was a properly symbolic end as , with her playboy lover , she was driven at midnight by a drunken driver much too fast in a Mercedes through a city underpass , pursued by photographers on motorbikes . <P> How sad ! What a pathetic life , after all , enlarged for us all by unrelenting advertisement , blown up like a fictional drama so that it is already entering , before our eyes , the realm of myth  --  an apotheosis that in previous ages took centuries to happen . In the world at large , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flying saucer somewhere : in Britain she is mourned with a hysterical intensity that seems pathological , ordinary people standing in line for seven or eight hours to sign a memorial book nobody is ever going to read , or preparing to camp out all night long to see the funeral cortege pass by .
