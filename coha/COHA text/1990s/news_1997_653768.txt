<p> Steven Roth , chairman of a high-flying real estate trust called Vornado , had lost twice this spring in bidding for properties in what is suddenly every investor 's hot market  --  Manhattan . He was determined not to strike out a third time . <p> So on Friday , April 25 , when it appeared that a rival had emerged as the leading bidder at 90 Park Avenue , where Sumitomo Trust and Banking was selling the mortgage , Mr. Roth plunged into a weekend of negotiations , landing the 41-story property for $185 million  --  $20 million more than Sumitomo originally anticipated . <p> Vornado Realty Trust 's decision to shove its way into the winner 's circle is but one example of the competition for prime office buildings in Manhattan and elsewhere around the nation  --  a battle rapidly propelling prices skyward . <p> At the heart of the battle are real estate investment trusts like Vornado . REIT 's , as they are known , are essentially investment pools . They have been around since the 1960 's , mostly as mortgage holders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But lately they have begun to own property outright , particularly office buildings , and they have become hot properties themselves  --  with investors . <p> With office space becoming tighter , these so-called equity REIT 's have an edge , since they can move faster and raise money more cheaply than old-line real estate moguls , hedge funds and investment banks . And with the number of REIT 's specializing in office buildings soaring  --  there was just one in 1994 but there are now 15 and at least four more are on the way  --  they often push prices beyond the seller 's giddiest expectations , even when they do not win . <p> That has longtime real estate executives and some analysts nervous . Indeed , after a tremendous run-up in the price of office REIT stocks last year , their values are down 5.8 percent this year , John Litt , an analyst with Paine Webber , said , because " investors were worried that office REIT 's are paying too much . " <p> The most aggressive trusts are buying properties less for the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later  --  a stark reminder of the bad old days , in the 1970 's and then again in the late 1980 's and early 1990 's , when many trusts and traditional real estate partnerships got into terrible trouble . Those deals were also based on high rent projections , which never came to pass . <p> In 1985 , for example , the prospectus for the real estate trust that held the mortgage on Rockefeller Center predicted that rents would double by 1995 , to $75 a square foot . Instead , rents plummeted to about $34 after a devastating recession , and the REIT teetered at the edge of bankruptcy . Goldman , Sachs and a developer , Jerry Speyer , ultimately paid $8 a share to buy out shareholders who had once seen the stock trade at $21 . <p> No one is predicting an imminent collapse now ; the real estate markets are too healthy for that . Rents are generally moving upward . But with prices pushed to the limit by the trusts ' buying sprees , the days of easy money in commercial real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates are down , said John Lyons , a founder of Granite Partners , a real estate investment bank . " But as the competition for quality properties has increased due to the vast amounts of capital in the market , " he said , " pricing has increased and therefore the returns have decreased . " <p> For real estate operators , the REIT structure provides tremendous access to capital , through either the stock market or private lenders . As long as the trust distributes 95 percent of its income to shareholders , it pays no corporate income tax . And while the private real estate partnerships popular in the 1980 's often involved a single risky asset , today 's trusts provide individual and institutional investors with a diverse portfolio of properties  --  and stock that can be bought and sold at any time . The market capitalization for all REIT 's has jumped from $56 billion in 1992 to more than $142 billion last year . <p> " We 've raised over a billion dollars , " said Thomas A. Rizk , president of the Cali Realty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.J. " We can enter transactions without financing contingencies and close transactions very quickly . " <p> Until recently , investors also made out handsomely . In 1996 , office REIT 's delivered a total return of nearly 50 percent , more than double that of the S. &; P. 500 , according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts , a trade group . If the trusts are overpaying for properties now , though , investors who have poured in billions of dollars in the last 24 months could see the once hard-charging stocks falter or retreat further than they already have . <p> Equity trusts emerged in the early 1990 's as REIT 's focused on apartment buildings and condominiums , the first properties to show signs of life after the recession . As the recovery spread , trusts appeared for retail , health care and hotel properties . <p> In 1994 , office REIT 's appeared in suburban markets on Long Island and in California , Massachusetts , New Jersey and Texas . Spurring their rise was a decline in office vacancy rates in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1996 from 16.2 percent in 1994 , according to Oncor International , a real estate data service . <p> Despite their relative youth , office REIT 's have a voracious appetite , gobbling 47.5 percent , or $6.7 billion , of the $14 billion in major office deals nationally so far this year , up from $5.2 billion in all of 1996 , according to Granite Partners . <p> The race to become a big , multibillion-dollar company is fueled by a sense that investors will reward size and diversity . A bigger company , in turn , can command lower borrowing rates , funnel more money into acquisitions and reduce administrative costs . And a bigger company must make bigger acquisitions to sustain a pattern of growth . <p> Yet real estate is a notoriously cyclical industry , and real estate trusts still control only a fraction of the nation 's commercial real estate , which undercuts their ability to impose hefty rent increases when tenants can easily go elsewhere for less . <p> Many REIT operators and analysts argue that the new trusts will not repeat the sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . It is also unlikely , they say , that the companies will venture too far out of line with the market this time . <p> The modern real estate trust , they note , is not heavily leveraged and public companies are required to release reams of financial data , which act to restrain aggressive impulses . <p> " There are buyers out there who have overpaid , " Mr. Rizk said . Still , he added , " I think investors have so much information that they can discern this very quickly and discourage companies from doing anything . " <p> Mr. Litt of Paine Webber suggests that some office REIT 's are now a relatively good buy because of the recent retreat in stock prices . <p> Meanwhile , there are signs everywhere of the trusts ' efforts to gain heft rapidly . In suburban Philadelphia , three REIT 's accounted for 10 of the 12 largest office deals in the last year , said James Vesey , a broker at Cushman &; Wakefield . Stephen Conly , director of Carey Winston Institutional Investment Group , described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In San Diego , Sam Zell 's Equity Office Properties outbid 31 prospective buyers for the Smith Barney Building , paying $36 million , or $193 a square foot , the highest rate in eight years , according to Property Information Exchange , a real estate research firm in New York . Equity Office Properties anticipates a jump in rents , though the property provides only a 6.7 percent return . A year ago , many REIT 's were looking at 10 and 12 percent returns , before subtracting the cost of capital . <p> " Prices have now risen by at least 10 to 15 percent in 1997 , for the same cash flow you were buying last year , " said Michael Kirby , a principal with Green Street Advisors , which follows the REIT industry . " There are probably still some opportunities out there , but if you throw darts at every contest , you 'll fall on your face . " <p> In March , Vornado was among the first real estate trusts to plunge into Manhattan , when the company paid $437 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving Mr. Roth control of four million square feet of New York office space . In the bidding for 90 Park Avenue , Mr. Roth , who has one of the best records of any REIT , went on to outmaneuver Starwood Capital and Leon Black 's Apollo fund . <p> REIT 's now consider Manhattan a promising market because there is plenty of room to raise rents . The economy is thriving , but there has been virtually no new construction in five years . So space is tight , while rents are well below what is needed to justify new projects . <p> The situation , though , is not as sanguine in other markets . " It 'll be interesting to see what happens , " said Jeffrey Newman of W &M; Properties , a landlord in Stamford , Conn. , who has watched three REIT 's  --  Equity Office Properties , Cali and Reckson Associates  --  battle for office buildings in Connecticut . " If their growth strategy is based on the continued escalation of rents , it makes me wonder . The rental buck stops somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be amiss came in March and involved two well-regarded REIT 's  --  Beacon Properties of Boston and Patriot American Hospitality , a large hotel REIT based in Dallas . <p> Word appeared on Wall Street that Patriot and Paine Webber had beaten four others in a bid to buy the Chubb Corporation 's huge Bellemead office portfolio in New Jersey for $1 billion . Investors reacted negatively , questioning both the high price and the decision to mix two very different kinds of properties , hotels and office buildings . <p> Though neither Chubb , Paine Webber nor Patriot ever commented publicly , people involved in the discussions say that Patriot backed away in light of the criticism . Recently , a joint venture between Paine Webber and the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II said it had agreed to buy the bulk of the Bellemead portfolio for a reduced price of $649 million . <p> " The best news may be that Patriot did n't participate , " said Mr. Kirby of Green Street Advisors . " It did n't make much sense to dilute the hotels with office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase of $601 million in office properties in Chicago and Los Angeles that were expected to yield a return of only 8.3 percent in the first year . <p> Alan M. Leventhal , chief executive of Beacon , which provided a total return to shareholders of 70.2 percent in 1996 , more than any other REIT , is unimpressed by the criticism and remains optimistic that continuing job growth will fuel a tightening of the market in many cities and thus a jump in rents . <p> " Those acquisitions will look better over time , " he said . <p> Graphs : " Conspicuous Consumption " Real estate investment trusts , or REIT 's , are hotter than ever , especially as buyers of commercial office properties . But now , increased competition among buyers is leading to higher purchase prices for buildings . That has hurt many REIT stocks , including these big ones .
