He vaults from behind the basket , back arched , arms extended , ball merely falling from his fingertips . But he is n't shattering backboards on the court or impishly destroying lamps at his grandmother 's New Jersey home as he did as a child . Shaquille O'Neal , the 23-year-old Orlando Magic megastar center and master dunkster , is tossing a miniature basketball through one of the many hoops positioned throughout his sprawling , two-story , $7 million home in an exclusive Orlando , Fla. , suburb . Standing 7-foot-1 and weighing a staggering 303 pounds of pure muscle , Shaquille Rashaun ( an Islamic name that means " little warrior " ) can afford to kid around . In 1992 , after his sophomore year at Louisiana State University , he became the first pick in the NBA draft and since has rebounded and slam-dunked his way to All-Star status . His power-packed , rough-edged playing style led to a handsome seven-year , $41 million contract with the Orlando Magic . But it was his raw talent and imposing frame coupled with his charismatic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag him as Michael Jordan 's heir apparent . O'Neal an articulate , soft-spoken star in his own right , refuses to make such a comparison to the retired Chicago Bulls star . " They paved the way for the rest of us , " O'Neal says , respectfully speaking of Jordan , Larry Bird , Magic Johnson and others he considers legends as well as mentors . " I 'm not a legend  --  yet . I just work hard at what I do . " Over the past three years , the NBA marquee player 's work has paid off in powerjam leaps and bounds . From the time he arrived on the pro scene , O'Neal not only has been seen as the savior of the fledgling expansion team ( whose record went from 21-61 to 50-32 just a year after his arrival ) , but an American icon and a multimedia celebrity . In addition to his basketball accomplishments , he has a platinum gold rap album , Shaq Diesel ; a box-office movie , Blue Chips ; an autobiography , Shaq Attaq ! My Rookie Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belt . Not to mention a personal net worth estimated at $70 million . But inside his palatial , 17-room retreat with its marble floors , vaulted ceilings and neoclassic design , the surprisingly mild-mannered jock speaks more like a restless kid than the king of an ever-growing empire , which includes a private company that manages all " Shaq " - trademarked products . In spite of his fame and fortune , O'Neal says he has been unable to fulfill one childhood dream  --  going to an amusement park . " I 've never had a chance to do that , not when I was younger and not now , " he says bashfully . Besides being faced with the possibility that his presence at a public park could cause a mob scene , the seven-footer says there is another reason why his fantasy has n't come true . " I ca n't fit in the seats , " he says . In the early years , he also had a problem fitting in and doing the right thing . " Yes , I did a little of everything : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls . At his worst , he says , he jumped from rooftops , threw tissue bombs at teachers , pulled school alarms , even bullied classmates . But his mischief and his stepfather , Philip A. Harrison , soon caught up with him . Harrison , a military man , married Lucille O'Neal when her son was two years old . A tough disciplinarian , Harrison kept Shaq in line with a swat on the butt when discipline was called for , O'Neal remembers . " I got tired of butt-whippings , so I asked my father one day what I needed to do to stop getting them . We said , " Do right , " so I did . " That lesson did not sink in immediately , but eventually a maturing O'Neal replaced his penchant for mischief with a love or sports . An " Army brat , " O'Neal moved with his family every three years , shifting from his hometown of Newark , N.J. , to bases in Georgia , Germany and San Antonio , Texas . He recalls having a modest , yet happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retired Army supply sergeant , worked three jobs to make ends meet . Yet the sergeant , O'Neal says , always took the time to coach him in football and basketball . Pride and respect reverberate in O'Neal 's voice when he mentions his parents , the two people he credits most for his success . He refers to his mother as " Mommie , " and calls Harrison his harshest , yet fairest , critic . The bond that O'Neal shares with his parents and his siblings  --  sisters , Lateefah , 17 , and Ayesha , 16 , and brother Jamal , 15  --  is a cord that fortune , fame and even O'Neal 's estranged biological father have been unable to shake . " He left me and my mother when I was just a couple of months old , " O'Neal says of Joe Toney , the biological father he says he never knew . Nevertheless , Toney recently resurfaced , making appearances on several talk shows in hopes of meeting with his famous son . " I did n't hear from him through high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's showing up on Howard Stern 's show , " says the basketball star . O'Neal has refused to say more than a cordial hello to Toney through a third party . And he says he has no plans to make room in his life for Toney as a father or a friend . As O'Neal sees it : " I have a father Harrison , and I have enough friends . " To vent his feelings about the situation , Shaq says he did it the best way he knew how  --  through rap . The result ? A top single , " Biological Did n't Bother , " the first release off the basketball star 's second album , Shaq Fu : Da Return . O'Neal may not want to rekindle a relationship with his natural father , but he is quick to shower his closest relatives with fine gifts . He bought houses for his grandparents in Newark and purchased a charming home in Orlando for his parents . He also presented the Harrisons with his-and-her Mercedes-Benzes . In O'Neal 's eyes , such lavish gifts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . " His strong convictions about family are what drives him to advise children to look up to their parents , not sports celebrities , as role models . " I do n't think children should try to be like Shaq , " he says . " There are only a few kids I can directly affect . Parents need to be the role models . My parents were the people I looked up to as a kid . And I still do . " Yet , the young athlete with the bald noggin and Shaft-inspired sideburns ( who usually sports a skull cap , a thick gold bracelet and a huge ring with his jersey number 32 outlined with diamonds ) , enjoys touching the lives of youngsters . Each year , he brightens the lives of children and adults alike by donating toys at Christmas , food to local shelters at Thanksgiving , gift packets to terminally ill and disadvantaged youths during most home games and flowers to nurses at local hospitals on Valentine 's Day . On the personal front , O'Neal 's heart belongs to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name , it only takes a few minutes of speaking to him to realize that the romance the two share is special to him . " She 's a real sweet young lady . She 's a regular person , not a Hollywood type , " he says of the business major he met at a dance club in Houston . " She reminds me of my mother . " At one time the sports star was romantically linked to actress Holly Robinson . Those reports , he says , were exaggerated . " It was nothing , " he contends . " We just dated a few times . " It 's been a long road toward self-actualization for the young man who used to stutter and intentionally slump over at age 14 , to hide his 6-foot-8 frame . But today , the NBA All-Star uses his height to dominate on the court . Thanks to Shaq 's domination , this season could turn out to be the best yet for O'Neal and his team . As the NBA 's top dunker , he leads the league ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , and he is among the NBA 's best in shooting and rebounds . As for the only perceivable flaw in his game  --  a free-throw average which hovers around 55 percent  --  O'Neal insists that improvement is in the air . " I 'm working on it , " he says while grimacing . " It 's not that bad at practice , but when I 'm On the court , it 's a whole different story . " O'Neal 's pace off the court is just as frenzied as it is on . There always seems to be a new project for him to launch or complete , such as his new martial arts video game , Shaq Fu , his new rap single , " No Hooks , " and plans for his next film , which he hopes will be an action adventure . ( " I think it would be cool to have a Black " Terminator " against Arnold Schwarzenegger , " he says . ) Plus , the off season is the one time of the year when O'Neal can work to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before turning pro . During down time , the young star enjoys the company of family and close friends . His mom , who helps with his fan mail , drops by his house regularly , sometimes bringing his favorite meal : fried chicken and macaroni and cheese . O'Neal enjoys entertaining guests in his fantasy game room , which includes coinless arcade-style video games , a digital pinball game that bears his name , a pool table , vending machine and a life-size alien figurine . For further R &R,; he takes his pet rottweilers , Thor and Shazam , for walks , or cruises around town blaring hip-hop beats in one of his four customized vehicles . It can be difficult to stay centered when your face is regularly plastered on T-shirts , toys and autographed photographs that sell for as much as $750 , but O'Neal , who is expected to gross $100 million by his 25th birthday , says his strong upbringing helps to keep him grounded . " The secret is not to be Hollywood . I 'm real . I 'm myself , " O'Neal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day the limelight will belong to someone else . " Until then , the basketball/entertainer extraordinaire says , " I 'm just a big kid , living it up and enjoying life . " <p>
