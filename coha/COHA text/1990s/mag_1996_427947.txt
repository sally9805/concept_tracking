// Four Southern restaurants charm us with legendary food and family service . The jokes were relentless-and decidedly in poor taste . Welcome to Miami Beach , folks , where the only " beautiful people " are elderly women back from the beauty shop . Movers and shakers ? Ambulances and paramedics . Says a smiling Stephen Sawitz , the fourth generation to run Joe 's Stone Crab Restaurant in the oncebeleaguered , now trendy , south Miami Beach : " We always knew this was a great place . It 's nice to have the last laugh . " With its legendary food and family charm , Joe 's Stone Crab Restaurant not only survived Miami Beach 's desolate years-when rocking chairs were the only movement in the once-faded Art Deco district-but also thrived . Like the stories behind Middendorf 's in Manchac , Louisiana ; Joe T. Garcia 's in Fort Worth ; and Stephenson 's Old Apple Farm in Independence , Missouri , Joe 's echoes the solidity of Southern restaurants rooted for 50 or more years in the same family , in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Weiss opened Joe 's Stone Crab Restaurant 83 years ago , the place has evolved into the Brown Derby of seafood . It 's the place to see , be seen , and indulge in the ultimate in seafood : stone crab claws . The rambling Mediterranean stucco structure with sophisticated , old-world touches inside and out is a far cry from the look of Joe 's original fish joint , which after numerous additions and renovations is buried somewhere in the midst . And although folks do wear fish-joint-style bibs , you 'll find business suits under them . ( Wear beachwear and you 'll not be seated . Joe 's has class . ) Visitors have included countless celebrities-from real-life terminator Al Capone to Terminator film star Arnold Schwarzenegger . Ask anyone-Joe 's is an event . At work , Stephen is swift on his feet , his eyes scanning for patrons to be acknowledged or waiters to be prodded . So many things need watching : the fleet of fishermen who provide a ton of stone crab claws a day from October 15 to May 15 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food preparation for as many as 2,000 diners-daily . Stone crab claws-recently priced at five large ones for $28.95 ( " they sell by the karat , " quipped Joe 's fan Damon Runyon ) - are the ultimate obsession for thrill seekers who love to dunk these chilled gems in butter or Joe 's famous mustard sauce . But Joe 's also reels in raves for other menu fare , from an unbelievable $4.95 for a plate of 10 cornmeal-crisp , plump oysters , to a flavorful Ginger Salmon ( $15.95 ) . Thirty-year patron Larry Aberman is always seen mingling at Joe's-shaking hands at one table , flirting at another-looking all the world like a maitre d ' . " They put up with me ' cause I 'm so happy here , " he says . " I 've eaten at the best restaurants in the world , but this is the best . " There is only one Joe 's Stone Crab and no plans for a franchise . " I could n't sell Joe 's , " Stephen says . Says Larry , " Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Restaurant , 227 Biscayne Street , Miami Beach , FL 33139 ; ( 305 ) 673-0365 . Open lunch and dinner year-round . Stone crab claws available October 15 through May 15 only . EAT AT JOE'S-AGAIN Just outside Fort Worth 's historic honky-tonk mecca , the Stockyards , another Texas landmark stands ( well , leans ) on its own , even without the area 's flashy neon **25;83;TOOLONG band attitude . After 61 years , Joe T. Garcia 's ropes in patrons with only a humble sign , an even humbler building , and a narcotic aroma of the freshest , most authentic family style Mexican food this side of Michoacan , the family 's native state . Joe T 's was Tex-Mex before Tex-Mex was cool . They still do n't take credit cards . And it was n't until recently that they caved in and offered fajitas . " We 're not big into change , " says Jody Lancarte , who for 25 years has helped husband Lanny run the place with his six siblings , and their mom , Hope Garcia Lancarte . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bakery and cafe , and its mail-order picante sauce business . " We could probably cut corners , but our customers demand authenticity . It 's the only thing that separates us from them the chains . " Photograph An early photograph shows Joe T Garcia ( behind register ) and his daughters at his namesake restaurant in Fort Worth . We raised my children in the kitchen , " says Hope Garcia Lancarte ( center ) . // Well , not the only thing . Joe T 's reputation for great ness has allowed them to expand their original 24-seat eatery over the decades into a kingdom of 1,200 seats . You 'll gaze at Joe T 's food disbelievingly , lovingly memorizing each curve of velvety , handmade corn and flour tortillas ; each luscious chunk of avocado and tomato in the guacamole ; each bite of feisty , tender barbecued meat or chicken . You 'll hurt yourself trying to drink it all in , especially if you drift too far into their top-shelf margaritas ( $5.25 ) while kicking back in Joe T 's lush courtyard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold platters of the thin-cut fried catfish that 's made the Pass Manchac , Louisiana , restaurant famous for 62 years . // Diners come en masse for " the dinner " ( $9 ) : warm tortilla chips and a delightfully hot sauce , two cheese nachos with jalapenos , two cheese enchiladas on a platter of rice and beans , two beef tacos , fresh guacamole , pico de gallo , and those heavenly tortillas . " We 're blessed with good business , " Jody says . But it 's " the everyday families that return again and again that make us the happiest , " she says . " I guess it 's because they like to see our family at work . It 's a good feeling . " Joe T. Garcia 's , 2201 North Commerce Street , Fort Worth , TX 76106 ; ( 817 ) 626-4356 . Open lunch and dinner daily . WILL DRIVE FOR CATFISH By the time you span what seem like endless miles of swamp-water bridges to get to Middendorf 's in Pass Manchac , a tiny fish camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anything . But you 'll get the exceptional : catfish sliced so fine , cornmeal-dredged so gently , fried so fast in oil so hot that you get the thinnest , crispiest , most golden rinds of sweet catfish you 'll ever want to-sorry . We get carried away . But that 's okay . The only real problem with feasting at the world 's greatest catfish shack is the need for a monorail so you can nap on your way back to New Orleans or Jackson , Mississippi , or wherever else nearby I-55 takes you . Photograph Middendorf 's servers Pam Millet and Dee Dee Holt hold platters of the thin-cut fried catfish that 's made the Pass Manchac , Louisiana , restaurant famous for 62 years . // Opened by Louis and Josie Middendorf in 1934 , the place is a bit less remote than it used to be , but it 's still off the beaten path for folks set on dining in New Orleans . " We 've had to work harder because of that , " says third-generation owner Susie Lamonte . It shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . Outside Middendorf 's , reeds and nettles whip in the hot breeze ; a nearby bait shop offers raccoon , turtle , and gator meat ; fish trucks rattle to and fro ; dragonflies bounce clumsily into your head ; hungry cats meow for discarded fish parts ; and hungry patrons line up for the real thing . Inside there are old family photos , wellenjoyed yellow Formica-top tables , and sideboards stocked with dozens of prized bottles of ketchup . Customers order from a menu that 's almost the same as it was 62 years ago-except for more healthconscious additions such as broiled catfish . Highlights include the house specialty " thin " fried catfish ( $9.50 for a large order , $6.50 for a smaller helping ) , more recognizable " thick " catfish tenderloins ( same price ) ; buttery fried oysters ( a dozen large , pillowy ones for $10.50 ) , and delicately sweet fried shrimp ( $10.75 ) . The secret ? " It 's all done by hand , " Susie says . " Our food 's just plain and simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleans off I55 ( Exit 15 ) at U.S. 51 North in Pass Manchac , LA 70421 ; ( 504 ) 386-6666 . Open lunch and dinner daily .. THE BUCK STOPPED HERE Stephenson 's Old Apple Farm in Independence , Missouri , is truly an American institution . It 's as American as apple pie . As American as apple fritters , apple cider , apple dumplings , and apple butter ( all made and sold there ) . And it 's as American as Independence native and President Harry Truman , who frequented the rambling , barnlike restaurant . " The apple business is all we ever knew , " says Les Stephenson , who with fraternal twin brother , Loyd , opened Stephenson 's in 1946 . The boyish brothers nibble on apple fritters in one of the red booths in The Parlor . With its red walls and Victorian furnishings , it 's the most gussied up of Stephenson 's nine homespun rooms . " See , it was after the war , and we needed jobs . But we did n't know what kind of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our grandparents had sold apples and other produce since 1870 , but I wanted a chicken dinner kinda place . " " Yeah , and I wanted a nightclub , " adds Les . " And we knew apples are what made Missouri great , " Loyd continues , " so we combined the best of both . " The brothers served 38 people that first day . These days ( after seven remodelings and additions to their grandparents ' original store ) they serve as many as 5,000 folks a week . All come in for such " scratch cooking " delights as Hickory Smoked Ham ( $14.95 ) , Brisket of Beef ( $14.95 ) , and apple everything-from drinks to dessert . With such Missouri charm , Stephenson 's became the apple of everyone 's eye-including President Truman 's . " He loved this place . It said ' home ' to him , " Loyd says . " But he and Bess did like to have a good time . One time we catered a party over at the Truman Library , and originally , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us she wanted some punch , and I want some with a little authority in it , ' " he recalls her saying . " Well , we concocted one for her Mrs. Truman 's Famous Fruit Punch , and we 've been selling it ever since . " These days the family business is stronger than ever , with Les and Loyd 's children helping with the original restaurant and four newer ones . " This is tough work , " Loyd says . " Even Truman once said , after seeing how busy it gets here , ' I would n't wan na run this place . ' And he was running the country !
