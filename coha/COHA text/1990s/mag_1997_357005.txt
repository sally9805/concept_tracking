Even as the President last week was sweet-talking big Democratic Party donors into pledging $250,000 each , the Clinton Administration was readying a new feint on the campaign-finance front : trying to reverse the Supreme Court 's landmark 1976 ruling , Buckley v. Valeo , which held that limits on candidates ' spending infringe on their free speech . Last fall Clinton boosted his efforts to pass the McCain-Feingold bill that would curb soft money and give candidates cheap TV time , but now it 's pretty much dead . Two weeks ago , he asked the Federal Election Commission to ban soft money by regulation , a request most reformers regarded as only a gesture . The Justice Department is now eyeing some pending cases from the Midwest , hoping one might be the ticket to persuade the court that unbridled spending is so corrosive to democracy that its First Amendment absolutism is outmoded . Court watchers say it 's a long shot at best . <P>  --  By J.F.O. McAllister and Karen Tumulty              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
