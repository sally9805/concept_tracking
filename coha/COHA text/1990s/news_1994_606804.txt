<p> In 1961 , Columbia Records released the four-record " Fletcher Henderson Story : A Study in Frustration , " accompanied by a provocative essay by Frank Driggs that began , " Why was the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra the single most important musical force in big band history ? " Now those same 64 songs  --  and Driggs 's provocative essay  --  have been reissued by Columbia/Legacy as a three-CD boxed set . Ultimately , the music does n't quite support Driggs 's assertion , but these 64 numbers are rewarding for their propulsive syncopation and inspired solos . They also have played an indisputably historic role in the birth of big-band swing . <p> The three greatest swing bands of the ' 30s and ' 40s  --  those led by Duke Ellington , Count Basie and Benny Goodman  --  each owed a huge debt to Henderson . Ellington not only hired many of Henderson 's best soloists but also admitted in his biography , " Fletcher was a big inspiration to me ; his was the band I always wanted mine to sound like . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basie said , " If it had n't been for his music , I do n't know where we would have been . " Goodman actually hired Henderson as an arranger and later acknowledged , " Without Fletcher , I probably would have had a pretty good band , but it would have been something quite different from what it turned out to be . " <p> Henderson was a recent college graduate and accomplished pianist who led a fairly conventional New York dance orchestra in the early ' 20s when he started to incorporate elements from the " jass " fad out " West " ( i.e. , New Orleans and Chicago ) . His first stroke of genius was to emphasize horns over the unwieldy amalgamation of banjos , pianos and violins that dominated the contemporary orchestras . His second inspiration was to ditch the stock arrangements sold by Tin Pan Alley publishers ; instead , he had alto saxophonist Don Redman write custom-made arrangements full of " hot " rhythms and solo openings for the band . Henderson also hired Louis Armstrong away from King Oliver in 1924 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This boxed set , which skims the cream from Henderson 's notoriously uneven output , includes not only the famous Columbia sides but also notable recordings for other labels ( but not , alas , any Bluebird sides ) . Featured are nine numbers with Armstrong ( including the legendary " Copenhagen " and " Sugarfoot Stomp " as well as Armstrong 's first recorded vocal on " Everybody Loves My Baby " ) . The trumpeter was so far ahead of his fellow musicians that it was n't until after Armstrong had left the band that Henderson 's Orchestra finally absorbed his lessons and turned them into such exciting jazz performances as " The Stampede , " " King Porter Stomp " and " Come On Baby , " with solos by Stewart , Redman , Benny Carter , Joe Smith and the first king of the tenor saxophone , Coleman Hawkins . <p> Henderson did not regularly achieve the rhythmic confidence nor the harmonic density of his three more-famous disciples , but he made their accomplishments possible and created some thrilling music in the process . <p> Geoffrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this album , call 202-334-9000 and press 8171 . ) <p> ' Louis Armstrong : Portrait Of the Artist as a Young Man ' <p> The indelible image of **27;433;TOOLONG Louis Armstrong as the affable performer of " Hello , Dolly ! " and " What a Wonderful World " has done little to shed light on his role as jazz 's first great virtuoso . <p> Perhaps the new " Louis Armstrong : Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man " ( Columbia ) will restore Armstrong 's stature as a player who was capable of flash , but also of substantial ensemble contributions and situational versatility . What is striking about this four-CD set is the manner in which Armstrong 's work personifies the democratic principle . He is both the shining individual and the selfless member of the ensemble . <p> And yet " Sleepy Time " and the more celebrated 1931 interpretation of " Stardust " aptly display Armstrong 's vocal prowess  --  his knack for melodic development and discreet but profound embellishment . During " When Your Lover Has Gone , " Armstrong 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terse trumpet chorus stings like heartache itself . <p> By 1934 , such standards as " Stardust " began to dominate Armstrong 's commercial output , but the unashamedly bluesy end of the trumpeter 's artistry is also presented here . There is 1929 's gently rocking blues " Knockin ' a Jug , " as well as Armstrong 's growling contributions to vocalist Maggie Jones 's 1924 " Anybody Here Want to Try My Cabbage , " a performance Madonna might envy . <p> Those unfamiliar with Armstrong 's versatility might initially find this collection dizzying . They should n't . This collection is the aural equivalent of a restaurant in which nearly everything on the menu is fine . <p> Reuben Jackson <p> ( To hear a free Sound Bite from this album , call 202-334-9000 and press 8172 . ) <p> ' Early Ellington ' <p> There are basically two methods of compiling a reasonably priced boxed set devoted to the expansive and daunting legacy of composer Duke Ellington : Keep a tight focus or offer a broad overview . The three-disc set " Early Ellington " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material Ellington recorded between 1926 and 1931 at the Brunswick studios in New York . It was a time of tremendous artistic growth and commercial success for Ellington , a period in which he developed his trademark " jungle " sound , gained celebrity at the Cotton Club and began writing for ( and giving license to ) an extraordinary array of inventive musicians . The moody " East St. Louis Toodle-oo , " in which Bubber Miley 's trumpet growls over commiserating reeds , opens the compilation and initiates an earthy , elegant and swinging procession of performances that include " Yellow Dog Blues " and " Tishomingo Blues " and the Jungle Band 's recording of " Mood Indigo . " <p> Because Ellington 's Brunswick recordings represented only about a quarter of the material he recorded during the period , " Creole Love Call " ( recorded for Victor in 1927 ) and other favorites are conspicuously absent from this anthology or are represented by alternate versions . Still , among the 67 performances are such revealing , entertaining and often overlooked gems as the " Twelfth Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Benny Payne ) , and tap dancer Bill Robinson 's wondrously rhythmic cameo on " Ai n't Misbehavin ' . " <p> ( To hear a free Sound Bite from this album , call 202-334-9000 and press 8173 . ) <p> ' Beyond Category : The Musical Genius of Duke Ellington ' <p> By contrast , the two-disc set " Beyond Category : The Musical Genius of Duke Ellington " ( Smithsonian/BMG ) views Ellington 's work through a wide-angle lens spanning four decades  --  1927 to 1967 . Drawn from the recordings his various bands made for the Victor , Bluebird and RCA labels , the anthology is dotted with definitive examples from the Ellington oeuvre . Many of them stem from the early ' 40s , when his ensemble boasted saxophonists Johnny Hodges , Ben Webster and Harry Carney , clarinetist Barney Bigard , trumpeter Cootie Williams , trombonist Tricky Sam Nanton and bassist Jimmy Blanton . These players were exceptional melodists , colorists and improvisers : Blanton elevates the role of the bass on " Jack the Bear " ; Williams deftly adorns " Concerto for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Webster enlivens and enriches " Cotton Tail " with a brief but glorious two-chorus solo . <p> Not the least of this set 's merits , though , are its lesser-known tracks . Hodges ' 1967 elegiac reading of " Blood Count , " inspired by Billy Strayhorn 's death , is preceded by his similarly sensitive rendering of the Ellington-Strayhorn ballad " Isfahan . " " Ad Lib on Nippon " is playfully unpredictable , and perhaps best of all is a live recording of the brilliantly evocative extended work " Harlem Suite . " Compiled and annotated by the Smithsonian 's John Edward Hasse , this collection complements his recent biography , " Beyond Category : The Life and Genius of Duke Ellington . " <p> Mike Joyce <p> ( To hear a free Sound Bite from this album , call 202-334-9000 and press 8174 . ) <p> ' Complete Bud Powell on Verve ' <p> High among the short list of be-bop 's most brilliant practitioners is pianist-composer Bud Powell , whose work is documented in two newly released boxed sets , the five-CD " Complete Bud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue Note and Royal Roost Recordings . " <p> Powell is understandably celebrated for the dazzling manner in which he handled be-bop 's often brisk tempos . The latter collection , which begins in 1947 and ends with a wooden 1963 reading of " Like Someone in Love , " aptly illustrates that melodic prowess . Eventually , the occasional tentativeness of " Indiana " and the ornamentation of " Somebody Loves Me " would be replaced by commanding improvisational mastery and witty yet declamatory chordal work . By 1949 , Powell 's first year of recording for Verve , he had mastered every tempo and could breathe brisk life into old material such as " Sweet Georgia Brown . " He was also a commanding ballad player , turning standards like Jerome Kern 's " Yesterdays " into melodically rich yet brooding meditations . <p> Much has been written about Powell 's physiological problems , which stemmed from a brutal police beating in 1945 , the results of which continued to plague him the remainder of his life . Both collections document the slow but sure decline in Powell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1954 's " Spring Is Here " demonstrate , Powell 's ability to infuse arresting emotion had deepened . <p> Reuben Jackson <p> ( To hear a free Sound Bite from this album , call 202-334-9000 and press 8175 . ) <p> ' Joe Henderson : The Milestone Years ' <p> The boxed set " Joe Henderson : The Milestone Years " ( Milestone ) contains eight CDs , is nearly 10 hours long and documents a nine-year stretch in which the tenor saxophonist often transcended prevailing musical settings and taste . No matter how dated or misguided some of these sessions sound today  --  and several are marred by electric keyboard doodling , psychedelic effects and overdubbing  --  there 's no mistaking the vocal-inflected emotion and harmonic daring that fueled Henderson 's playing . <p> Henderson 's 1967-1976 tenure with Milestone came between his early dates as a leader on Blue Note ( 1963-1966 ) and the widely ( and deservedly ) acclaimed recordings he 's made for Verve since 1991 . He recorded 12 albums as a leader for Milestone , under circumstances that occasionally mirrored the politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning , however , we find him working in untrendy settings that recall his Blue Note days , fronting small , aggressive groups at once animated and anchored by a first-rate rhythm section  --  pianist Kenny Barron , bassist Ron Carter and drummer Louis Hayes . Early on , though , producer Orrin Keepnews also suggested that Henderson perform " Chelsea Bridge , " and the result  --  a tender , languid , warmly harmonized interpretation of the Billy Strayhorn ballad  --  ranks among the compilation 's most haunting performances . <p> In addition to accommodating Lee Konitz 's cerebral designs on the austere but affecting saxophone duet " You Do n't Know What Love Is , " Henderson later proved equally adept at meeting other challenges . The evidence gathered here is both abundant and diverse , including " The Bead Game , " a totally free improvisation ; electric dates with keyboardist Larry Willis and guitarist James " Blood " Ulmer ; atmospheric alliances with harpist and pianist Alice Coltrane ; and concert performances with trumpeter Woody Shaw . <p> In fact , in the liner notes Keepnews quips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album  --  except a hit . " That was n't entirely for want of effort , though . Some of the once fashionable jazz-funk tracks Henderson recorded in the 70 's were clearly aimed at expanding his audience . Yet , as annotator Bill Kirchner points out , the effort may have failed because even these recordings reflected Henderson 's " undiminished intensity .
