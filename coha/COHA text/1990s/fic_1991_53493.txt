The only time piece in the house was his watch ; and that was under his pillow still , still on his wrist . His brother would be here in half an hour ; his overnight satchel was already packed  --  a clean pair of drawers , his toothbrush and razor , a Hershey bar she hid in a pair of his mended socks . There was nothing for her to do here now but make the coffee and watch him walk through the door , down the slope to his brother 's car and then away . <p> She had halfway dreaded the news all summer ; but when the letter came three weeks ago and he said " Well " and left it open on the table to read , she knew this morning would be the last . No way the Army would turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as men were , this late in the war . When he had seen her pick up the letter , he stood at the screen door , watching the woods , and told her the ways you could beat the draft  --  all the foolish dodges he 'd heard from scared boys . His favorite seemed to be vinegar and prune pits . The night before your physical exam , you drank a tall glass of white cider vinegar and swallowed three prune pits . Then you told the Army you had stomach ulcers ; they x-rayed your belly , saw the dark shadows and shriveled lining and sent you home with a sympathetic wave . <p> Without a word , she had bought the prunes and left them out on the shelf by the stove ; the vinegar was always there in plain view . But he never mentioned the plan again , and last night she knew not to bring it up . Every bone in her body guessed he meant to leave . It made good sense , though it hurt like barbed wire raked down her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he never said it . And she would n't force it from him , not that last night . That was up to him . <p> After she brushed her teeth on the stoop and peed in the bushes , she came back in , damped the woodstove down , then shucked her sweater and dungarees , put on the flannel night shirt and crawled in beside him . She had lain there flat , saying her few prayers quick before he touched her . But he never did , not with his hands . Their hipbones touched and parts of their legs ; but somehow the warm space built up between them till she felt gone already , that near him . <p> After five minutes he said " Remember , I set the alarm . " He knew how much she hated the bell ; it was one more way to say You do it . You wake up and spare us . <p> She had said " All right " and then " I 'm thinking you 'll live through it , Kayes . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he 'd die overseas ; and most of the times , he would laugh or sing a few lines of some hymn . But she knew he meant it ; she said it to help him face the night , not because she was sure . And as far as she could tell , he had slept like a baby . She thought I slept like a baby too , a mighty sick child ; but she also knew she had not dreamed once . That froze her as much as the cold dawn air  --  If I did n't dream last night , I 'm the corpse  --  and she calculated they had the minutes to hitch up , one more farewell time . Her hand went toward him under the cover . <p> For the only time in the months he had known her , he stopped the hand with his own and held it . In another minute he said " Much obliged , " then threw back his side of the cover and sat up . <p> It was still too dark to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamp , she thought " Except for this war , we 'd stay right here . He do n't give a goddamn for nothing but me . " Even without the sight of his face , she almost half-believed it was true . And early as it was in a chilly week , she was more than half-right . It had been nearly true for six quick months . He had never admitted as much by day ; but he proved it at dusk by turning back up at this door here , living her life beside her in private and sometimes in town and telling her things with his body by dark that , she almost knew , were meant to last . <p> When he finished the coffee , he poured hot water in the big tin pan , lit the lamp by the mirror and slowly shaved . <p> She sat at the table and watched every move . All her life , she envied men those minutes each morning , staring at a face they seemed not to notice , not trying to make it thinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put on the first necktie he had worn since moving here ; it had waited on a nail in the old pie safe . He took his change and knife from the shelf and portioned them out into several pockets . He took up the long narrow wallet and searched it . She thought " Oh Jesus , now here it comes . Like every other white man God ever made , he thinks we can cross this out with money . " <p> But he managed it altogether differently . He came the whole way to the table and sat again , in a fresh cold chair . He said " Please look right here at my eyes . " When she looked , he said " You have been too good to me , every day . I will know that fact from here to my grave , wherever I find it . If I do n't come back alive in time , remember I said I love you true . I was sober when I said it , and I meant every word . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now give me both hands . " <p> She had no choice but to spread both palms between them on the table , though she watched him still . He laid two fifty-dollar bills down first ; then he took off his watch and laid it on them . He had sometimes let her wear it on days when she doubted his promise to be here by dark . <p> She said " The money will help me a lot ; thank you kindly . But you 're going to need that watch overseas . " <p> He understood she did n't mean that ; she meant she thought it belonged to his wife , had been her gift to him years ago . So he dosed both her hands now , money and watch , and said " I bought that watch myself . It 's yours till the day I walk back in here , claiming it again . <p> " She had to nod , dry-eyed as a boy . <p> He stood up and , before he got both arms in his coat , a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped to the door . <p> She stood where she was . <p> With a hand in the air , he kept her in place . " Do n't let me see you in the cold , " he said . Then some way he melted , silent , and was gone . <p> It was then that she knew the room was hot and dry as a kiln . She thought she was free to howl like a dog , and she sat there and waited for a moan to rise . But the car door slammed ; and she heard it leave and fade completely away toward Raleigh with still no tears in her eyes , no moan . She said his name Kayes and waited again . But no , nothing came . So she stood and rinsed out both their cups and set them upside down on the shelf where they sat before he ever came here . Beyond her even , they had been her grandmother 's and had sat unbroken in this same room long before she was born to meet this man that hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything  --  I used to answer . But from way beore I remember good , every soul I knew but my mother called me Blackie . <p> That was because my skin was n't black . Mama was medium dark , a good walnut . And Red , Mama 's aunt that mostly raised me , said my gone daddy was what they called blue gum that long ago , with skin so black his gums were blue . Most Negro babies are born real pale ; but even with the kin I had behind me , everybody said I was born nearly white and stayed that way when most children shade on off , tan or dark . So somebody called me Blackie early , the way they called my fat friend Skinny Minnie ; and Blackie hung onto my life like a burr  --  Blackster , Black , Blackheart . I answered . <p> Even Kayes sometimes called me Black but just if he got mad or hungry  --  " Black , get your butt to the stove and start frying . " Mostly he called me Leah or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mama always said it came from the Bible . But when I got old enough to read for myself , the Bible said Leah was what Jacob got for his first wife when what he worked so long for was Rachel . It even said he hated Leah , and that set me back  --  I was meeting stiff winds from a good many sides , without adding that . So I waited till Mama was gone one night , and then I asked Red . She said " Your mama ca n't read a soap box , much less the Good Book . What you think she knew about some dead Leah ? She just heard a preacher calling that name and liked the sound . Your mama would crawl to the moon for a sound  --  music in her bones ; her daddy could sing . " <p> There have been many people that took me for white . And they did n't think my name was a joke , or maybe it came from my straight hair . Red said I come here , a happy-haired baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Half the men I know  --  any color you name  --  have tried to touch my hair , just for luck if no more , no serious fun . I been a clean person ; I mean my skin . Even before I could hardly talk , in this cold house , Red said I would scrub in icy well-water before she had time to boil the first kettle  --  said " Black , you would fiat-out polish your hide . " <p> I would . And it paid . I do n't mean I 've yet took one penny for it . I 'm way too proud and , till this spring , I never saw a man I wanted to have it . I mean my skin is the finest I 've seen ; and I 've been up and down the land since 1919 , when Mama lit out of here with me by the hand . First stop was Wilmington , Delaware . She stayed a few years ; then came on bach , too sick to take that winter they have . Watching her cough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I traveled a lot while I had strength . <p> Harlem , Springfield , Pittsburgh  --  you name it . And nobody , white or green , can match me , nobody I 've seen ; and I 've seen a heap of shows . It 's made me good friends , all up the line . Friends , I 'm saying , not tomcats prowling  --  they 'll eat any meat . Monied ladies in Packard cars , old men at clubs where I served meals , they told me time and again " You 're splendid . Can I touch you for luck ? " I tell em I 'll touch them and then touch their hand or the back of their wrist . That does the trick . <p> It puts them at ease , almost every time , and I pass on . I 've met little meanness , wherever I went ; and the little I meet , I dodge in the road or slap up side the head bad , then run . So I was up North from eighteen to thirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till fifteen months ago when Red broke her hip and sent for me . I hauled my precious skin on home , this ramshackle room , and kept watch with her till she passed on . <p> If I do say so , I did more than watch . Red got far more worse off than a baby , could n't hold her water nor none of her mess . She thought I was my own mama most nights . She would lay me out for bringing men close as her Cape jasmine bush , under that window facing the road , and humping on the ground where Red could hear . <p> I heard more of it than anybody knew . And God 's my witness , till I got Red laid out in a casket in white satin pleats and deep in the grave , no man nor boy  --  not to mention hot women , and several have tried-ever laid more skin on me than a finger . I was one brown girl that had heard enough from two tails pumping . I 'd take any music on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All through Red 's last weeks alive , men would walk in here with hot fish dinners , chicken salad , peach pie . I 'd thank them " profusely , " as Red used to say , and ask had they heard any war news today ? That would throw em for a loop ! They were all 4-Fers with pus in their blood or , worse , they were hiding out from the Army . Till this war 's over , I wo n't take that ; I feel right patriotic someway . Back at first , I even had dreams of being an Army nurse and going to England when they were so bad off , bombs every night . I was still fool enough to think they could train you fast and ship you out . Every Negro I told said " Get your head tested , child . It ai n't your fight . They do n't want you . " So I stopped telling my hopes and dreams . But my mind never changed , which is why I could n't tell Kayes to shirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He came to Red ' s funeral with Riley his brother . When Kayes walks in , nobody sees Riley ; but he 's all right or used to be . Red had been their grandmother 's cook many years ; and they were so welcome that one of my cousins , the big head-usher , set Kayes on the front row next to the aisle . When they led me in behind the casket , the only pew vacant was that same pew . So I nodded to Kayes , that was next to me , and sat two or three yards ' distance from him . <p> Make a long story short  --  he came on with us to the grave out back and saw Red covered . It near killed me and , swear to God , I thought he filled up . See , he had loved his grandmother much as I loved Red . She had raised him when his own mother left , run off with her own first cousin  --  a drunk  --  and left Kayes ' daddy , Kayes himself who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . She left them , clean as a bat leaves Hell every evening at dusk . And Kayes ' old grandmother , Miss Marianne , she took the whole crowd in and raised him right . Or at least the best she knew how to do , with my Red cooking every crumb they ate and washing and pressing every thread they wore . So sure , he ought to have cried at her grave . <p> What he did after that was walk halfway through the grove to his Chevy with Riley beside him . Then he stopped in his tracks like my eyes had shot him . I had n't been watching him all that close  --  I was bent with the hardest grief I 'd known , till this week now  --  but he spoke to Riley , who kept on going , and then he came back . When I saw him turn , I said in my heart " He 's coming to me . " I was dead-out wrong . It was still too early in the spring for flowers . But somehow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen better days . It was in his left hand . No other carnations were anywhere near , no wreath he could have stolen it from . I know I told myself " Black , he 's grown it . " I must have thought it bloomed that minute in his fist  --  big fist that had already bruised it some . <p> Anyhow not looking to me one time , he came right back to the edge of the grave , where Red ' s coffin sat with clods on the lid  --  two boys were standing there , waiting for me to move out of sight so they could finish-and he reached far down as his arm would go and let that one bloom fall on the dirt , where I knew Red ' s face was still looking up . I 'd never been partial to grown white people . Red and Mama both said you could trust them if you 'd known them long . <p> I 'd known Kayes Paschal since I was maybe four years old  --  Red bringing me to work some days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead . I never had paid him that much notice . There at the grave though , I thought he looked good . Everybody but Kayes thought that and still thinks it . But sad as I was , he got no deeper into my mind or bosom than any tan man , not to mention the dark . I knew he married the banker 's daughter that Red once said " could frost the sun , " and she did n't mean with sugar . <p> But once I heard that lower hit Red ' s dirt , something snapped inside me in the midst of my chest . It takes a lot more than a white carnation to catch my eye . I did n't forget we were separate people , Kayes and me . I never once thought he 'd speak to me , and I did n't dream I 'd want it . But for some strange reason , I had held up good , right to that moment . You 'd have thought I was some neat-dressed great-niece of Red 's . But with Kayes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my heart " Live through this , Leah , and you 're guaranteed . " I do n't know what my fool mind meant . <p> I sure did n't think how hard his family had worked poor Red and or what slim pay , or how they 'd drive her out every night to this piece of a shed , saying " See you tomorrow , " when for all they knew she 'd die in the night of cold or snakebite . All I understand , even today , is I took the first step forward to meet him . Kayes saw me moving and stepped on toward me . It was n't till he put out his big hand that I saw the wide gold ring on his left ; he was still married to her . But it meant no more to me that day than a callus or a mole on his finger would . <p> Four days later though , as I was thinking I might better get my butt back North , I had stepped out into Red 's yard to wash my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something made me look toward the road . And here came Kayes again , walking the way he had to Red ' s grave , with his chin tucked down and leaning a little forward on the air , like a wind was trying to send him home . I said to myself " It 's nothing but Kayes . " <p> But once he got through the blackberry vines and spoke to the dog-they were friends , way back  --  I felt my eyes go straight to his hands . Big as they were that day by the grave , they had grown again . The right hand carried a brown paper sack ( turned out it was three of the Hershey bars that Red used to want ) ; the left hand that day was naked as mine . My mind said " Blackster , here it comes . Say no . You 're too good or this . " Even if no two people alive would believe a woman named Blackie was a virgin at thirty-one , I meant not to change , not for this white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . Turned out I was wrong . <p> Kayes 's only brother was driving  --  Riley , three years younger but badly nearsighted and safe from the draft . He had married young , a plain girl tall as Riley and patient with all his shyness and fears . And they had two daughters , both smart and so lovely you might have looked at their pleasant parents and thought each girl was bought or adopted from a line of beauties or personally sent as a gift by God . As Kayes sat quiet in the car beside him , he thought " You 're plain as boiled potatoes , but you sure got the luck . " <p> It was not self-pity , just the visible truth  --  look at Riley 's wife , their girls , his money . Kayes and Riley had split their father 's land with an amicable coin toss . Kayes got the better half and a hard-working tenant but lost money most years . Riley coined gold on sandy soil with a string of tenants no better than thieves . Look at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from poor country stock but a certified saint . Kayes 's wife Daphne had money to spare from her banker daddy and blood so blue it could pass for ink ; but her mind had shut when the son was born , named Curtis after her dead father . <p> Good as Curtis was , the boy drew all her care onto him . Kayes had guessed that things would balance out as the boy got older . But now he was fourteen , and still Daphne watched him like the first angel landed . So for that many years , except on unpredictable nights when her gate swung open with no complaint , Kayes was lonesome as the last tree standing on the moon itself . And full though he was of love and need , until he saw Leah that day at Red 's funeral , he had touched no more than three other women . And all were white , all big young country girls that laughed at the end and went back to work with barely a word to prove he 'd known them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned away from Red 's graveside , and Leah there behind him , he told himself " Forget her now . " And he nearly succeeded . Despite the fresh sight of Leah 's good face and his older memory of tales his friends told , long years back about colored girls , Kayes 's mind soon turned to the things he must order for his tenant at the Feed and Seed  --  a load of cottonseed meal , one of lime , a case of formula powder for the baby ( the tenant had four , none old enough to work ) . <p> It was n't until he climbed the steps of his house an hour later and heard Daphne calling to Curtis  --  " Baby , run "  --  that Leah rose again in his mind , exactly as fine a face and bones as anybody left in the county , any woman . And before his hand touched the front-door knob , Kayes thought " I 've known her since before she could talk . " It was simply true but it meant a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on till now today . <p> Riley cleared his throat to break the long silence . " You think they 'll want you ? " <p> Kayes was so far off , it came at him strangely . " Want me ? The Army ? They 'd want you , Bud , if you were n't blind . " <p> Riley took both hands off the wheel and bent to the windshield to search out the road , a blind driver . Dawn was in progress , a dull tin color , and the windows were still transmitting cold . " You used to have your old heart murmur . What happened to that ? " <p> Kayes said " My heart ai n't spoke for years . " He did not mean anything deep or sad ; but once it was out , he thought it through . It was wrong ; he had spoke out to Leah , just now , in the room . Knowing they had less chance in the world than a baby left all night in the snow , Kayes had finally told her the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to the side of his brother 's thin face . They had not shared secrets for twenty-odd years ; but they 'd never broke faith , never lied when pressed or failed one another 's unending trust . So Kayes said something he had planned for days , " Riley , if I get killed over  --  " <p> Riley did n't look but his right hand came out accurately and brushed Kayes 's mouth . <p> " No , old Bud , this has to be . If I come back in less than top-shape , you 'll be my executor ; so you need to know . Daphne has got her own money , a plenty . Anyhow the law gives her a widow 's share . Most of the rest goes to Curtis of course , but I put down five thousand dollars for you . Please give half of that to Leah . " <p> " Leah ? " <p> " Lee  --  Blackie  --  you know . Do n't fail me , Bud . " <p> Riley said " Absolutely . " And when Kayes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave , do n't you , Kay ? " <p> Kayes nodded . " Yes , God  --  leave now awhile but not die , I guess . " <p> Then he chuckled . <p> Riley said I 'll be here to meet you , be sure . But where will you live ? " <p> Kayes looked to his right . The sun , in climbing , had turned the pines from a near-black green to a color that made him think " Emerald . " As a boy Kayes collected the most , the best , the scarcest things ; and somewhere he read that perfect emeralds were rarer than diamonds and cost more money . Though he was the least poetic of souls and cared less for money than a year-old infant , he looked at the pines now and thought " Countless billions . " Then he wondered what in the world he meant . Well , surely he was trying to dodge Riley 's question . So he kept on looking , counting pine trunks now . <p> Riley said " You understand Blackie will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Kayes said " Why 's that ? " He still faced outward . <p> " Assuming some white trash does n't burn her house down , what will she eat ? Nobody that knows about you and Daphne will give Black a job . " <p> Kayes saw that was right . But he played the words again in his mind  --  was Riley hateful at all , out to hurt him ? Did he mean to harm Leah ? But in memory , the words played back straight and true . As ever , Riley had no grain of spite . So Kayes felt safe to look around  --  Riley met his eyes for as long as was safe  --  and said " O.K. , I 'll authorize you to pay her a wage to stay at old Red 's house and fix it up . Paint the walls , mend the windows  --  Lee 's smart with a hammer ; she says she 's worked , painting rooms up North . " <p> Riley said " I do n't doubt it . But Kay , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't forget . Grandmother gave it to Red , long since , and the halfacre round it . " <p> It was news to Kayes ; he thought the house was on Riley 's half of the family land . All through his time out there with Leah , when his mind backslid , he told himself " My family 's owned this house forever . Let any fool tell me to leave . " He gave a little shake and tried to laugh . But Riley 's profile was solemn again . So Kayes said " You might should have told me that , months ago . " <p> Riley said " You 're a grown man . You chose your path . " <p> Kayes waited a good while . " How lost did I get ? " <p> " Beg your pardon ? " <p> Kayes saw Riley now as he was in childhood , a serious boy who would answer you true  --  anything you asked . " How much have I broke ? " <p> Riley knew they were in deep water now ; he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked over , for the time he could spare . " Maybe nothing . Daphne 's strong as an iron stake . " He tried to end there . <p> Kayes pushed him on . " I 've got a son  --  " <p> Riley nodded . " I 'm his godfather . You forget that ? " <p> " Have you talked to Curtis in all these months ? " <p> Riley said " Every Sunday but Easter  --  he was busy . " <p> " How much does he hate me ? " <p> Riley said " A good deal . He 's protecting his mother . You know how that is . " <p> " Any chance he could ever feel better about me ? " <p> To both their surprise , Riley suddenly laughed . " If you died a big hero , scaling the breastworks , shot in the brow , Curt might recover . " <p> Kayes managed to smile . " I may oblige him . " <p> " They do n't have breastworks these days , Kay . " <p> By now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful sights  --  trees and fields and low white houses in bare oak groves , the big hollow rock where a family was buried upright in a shaft , a mother and father and three young boys . Now they were coming to the fringe of Raleigh , where the town swelled out and killed the land from bedrock upward . Even the vacant ground was blighted , unwilling to yield . Kayes told himself " They are all better off , with me out of sight . " He meant all the people who thought they needed to lean on him ; he hoped they knew better . <p> Riley spoke as if each word cost thousands . " I guess this here is your best bet , a piece of the war . But I want you to know  --  I 'll miss you terrible . You 're a lot to me , Kayes , and nothing 's changed that . " <p> Kayes knew not to look ; it would break them both . But he said " I guarantee I feel the same . " And from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and assorted men and boys would be examined for nothing but strength and the sense  --  if called upon  --  to die decent , Kayes thought about Leah . <p> Forget about Hitler and the wide Pacific , I could die this minute in full possession of all I hoped to find in life , whoever I hurt  --  and I stand ready to pay for them , two of the faces  --  ( 1 ca n't help Leah ) . One smart grown woman wanted me . Just me in a room , no money , no stunts , no lifetime deal . No mention of what any blind man could see  --  we were different animals , her and me , not meant to plow in a double yoke , not here nor now . <p> But we made it last for six whole months . Any hour on the clock , I could slide my car in off that road , below Red 's pitiful piece of a house , and set my foot to the ground to climb those last hundred yards ; and Lee would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was back and would raise her whole fine shape to meet me . Not a time , no single time I recall , did I climb all the way to the house without her walking to meet me or waiting in the yard with a cup of water or , if it was cold , in the window at least with oil light behind her and both eyes ready to smile me in . <p> My skin . She evermore used my skin . She was like a sensible squaw in the winter , kids starving around her and then her man kills one last deer  --  Leah took my body and used every part to save us both , not a particle wasted . It was all food and easement . That 's a word I 'd never used but in arming , giving somebody an easement on land , to haul his crop across some corner of your woods or fields . But toward the end of the first whole week I stayed at Red 's , I woke in the night and could hear Leah breathing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The few other women I 've known , deep in , would need to speak at a time like that , just to prove it was real . Lee was calm as ever . So a word just came to my lips , and I said it  --  " Easement "  --  and Lee said " True . " 1 still think she understood all I meant , though we never discussed it by daylight . Never . <p> Have I wrecked her too ? Bud 's right ; some trash boys might try to scare her  --  the Cagles or some of the moron Coggins . But once 1 finally told her , last night , the possible mess I might leave her in , did n't she say " Where you think I been ? I did n't turn nigger this afternoon . All my life I lived for trouble  --  and child , trouble came  --  so I take my chances , like I took on you . Look what that got me . " When I asked her what ? , she said " Some time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , if I live to keep thinking and figuring out . " Then she broke out smiling in the dim oil light , the smile that could give me all I lost . And when I tried to say what to do tonight , if the Army kept me , she put both hands to her ears and frowned  --  a grown woman 's frown , knowing all she knows . And speaking of pain , she out-knows me . <p> Riley found a parking place in sight of the warehouse and killed the engine . He looked to Kayes and said " Can I come in ? " <p> Kayes said " Thank you , no . They 'd ship you straight to Japan by noon . " It did n't mean anything but " Clear out please ; let me do this right . " <p> " But what if they fail your stiff old joints ?  --  you 've got to ride home . " <p> The fact had really not dawned on Kayes ; he was so sure of leaving . He thought it out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that ? ) and then said " The bus will stop right by Red 's , if I ask it to . I wo n't need it though . " He leaned over slowly and amazed his brother with a silent hug . When Kayes sat back , he looked to the panel clock ; it was almost seven  --  he was in good time . He opened his door and said the last thing . " If you do n't hear from me by dusk , please drive out to Red 's and tell Lee I 'm gone . If she needs to go on somewhere safe  --  maybe one of her cousins  --  I 'll pay for your gas . " He handed Riley the keys to his car . <p> Riley took them and nodded . <p> And Kayes loped away . Within three yards , he told himself " I will never see that boy 's face again . " The boy was Riley , as ever in his mind . Sad as he knew he ought to feel , Kayes was light on his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the building first , Kayes said " We 're in the same rowboat , son . You first . After you . " <p> The boy said " Yes sir " and took the lead with all the joy of a Judas goat at the slaughter pen . <p> For an instant as the boy moved , the side of his face looked like young Curtis  --  young as Curt anyhow , smart and distrustful . But still Kayes could laugh . <p> 4 Since it was Saturday , Curtis had planned to sleep till ten , maybe closer to noon . Then he meant to find Cally , his friend with the rifle , and go squirrel hunting . But at eight o'clock , Daphne came to the shut door , waited a minute , creaked it open and said " Please , Curt . I need you today . " <p> He could always wake on a dime , that fast ; but he lay on and thought " You need somebody but I 'm not the man . " Beneath him , his dick was hard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down in time . " But he said " What for ? " <p> " What time did your father say he was leaving ? " <p> Kayes had been at the west-side door of school yesterday afternoon as Curtis came out . The boy had seen the car , first thing , and was split between a taste for running straight to it with pleasure and the colder sense of his mother 's pride  --  what she was still bearing and would need from him . He had seen his father only four short times in the past six months , and each time was harder than the one before . So Curtis walked over slowly now , opened the door and leaned in gravely . Kayes asked him to sit for a minute and talk . The boy obeyed but the talk came mostly from Kayes  --  he had already given Riley instructions to pay for anything Curt really needed . If the Army took him , he 'd write letters weekly ; please write to him . <p> All Curtis could do was nod " Yes sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man so much and so deeply , so faraway back in the fourteen years that felt long to him . Bitterness poured up into his mouth now and nearly choked him . Curtis kept saying , time and again to himself , " If he just wo n't say that woman 's name "  --  the only name Curtis knew was Blackie ; and he heard that at school , not once from his mother . She 'd die before speaking it . <p> When Kayes let up , the boy looked at him for the first full time and said " I 've thought this through a lot . I hope they take you , I hope you come back , I hope it 's you when you get here though . " Kayes waited awhile , looking ahead , and then said " I thank you . And I 'll work on it , son . But this may be me , right here and now . " Then he gave Curt an envelope that , back home , turned out to be two fifties  --  new as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's mother asked if Kayes had seen him . Curtis told her all of the truth he could risk , " Yes ma 'm . He looked ready . " She started the growling edge of a sneer ; but Curt faced her down  --  no word , wide-eyed . <p> Now as he lay still , praying she would vanish , she held her ground and repeated " What time ? " <p> " Ask Riley , " Curtis said . <p> " Uncle Riley  --  " <p> " You know who I mean ; he 's got a phone . " <p> " Do n't be impudent , son  --  I slept at least two minutes last night . Anyhow I know Riley 's driving him to Raleigh . " <p> " Then you know more than me . I was sleeping fine . " <p> " Curt , where is his car ? " <p> " In Raleigh , I guess . " <p> Daphne said " Surely not ; he 'd ride with Riley . " <p> Curtis sat up suddenly and faced his mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strung tight now and scarily pale . Still he said " Then I guess the damned car is at Blackie 's place . He gave it to her . " Curtis had never seen Blackie , not close at hand . But once her name was loose in the room , it threatened to stand her between them now , tall and stern and smelling like Kayes . <p> Daphne swallowed hard but concealed the shock . Finally site said " Is that a known fact , or are you just dealing in meanness today ? " Curtis said to himself " One more bull's-eye , " anti his face flushed red . <p> He turned to the wall , but he said " What now ? " <p> She said " I 've thought all night . By decent rights , that car is ours  --  " <p> " He 's not dead , Mother . " <p> " Hush . But you know full well the Army will take him . " <p> " I do n't , no ma 'm . " <p> Daphne waited . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Curtis said " His ear , that strawberry mark . " <p> Before she thought , Daphne said " No , that used to be lovely . " Then she heard herself and took a step to leave . <p> But Curtis said " We could drive out and get it . " <p> " You and me ? But who would drive it back ? Baby , you are n't legal at the wheel , not yet . " <p> " You got your key ? I can drive as good as any two men ; nobody will stop us . " <p> Daphne said " What if she 's there ? And what if Riley brings him back ? " <p> Curtis 's dick was calm for the moment . He knew he must take that chance to dress . As he threw back the cover , he said " I 'll tell my father it was my idea ; he still likes me . You can let me out on the road and head back . I 'll handle the rest . " As his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice easy ; but what he said was " My father 's name is Kayes  --  remember ?  --  not just he . " <p> Daphne said " I ca n't say it . " It was only a fact , not a plea for pity . <p> But all the way into deeper country , with Curtis sullen on the seat beside her , she gripped the wheel and thought little else . Kayes , Kayes . I want it all back , those short first years we were good to each other . You ca n't want this ; surely you 're crazy . But none of your people have lost their minds ; God knows , none of mine . And I ca n't blame liquor , which both of my sisters can blame in good faith  --  I doubt you 've had three drinks in ten years  --  so here I 've stood with no explanation to give the world , except to say you 've lost your mind . <p> All the women I know say that much already , when I 'm not present-though ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of the absolute blue , ' Daph , the fact that the girl 's light-skinned as you makes it all the worse . ' I pretended I missed it and Roe shut up . But I understood her-Kayes , if you 'd gone to a coal-black girl , we 'd have had this over long months ago and be back together , on the old right rails . Tell that to any three doctors south of Baltimore , and they 'd sign an order in a New-York minute to strait-jacket you and cool you off till reason prevails . <p> But you picked a woman no darker than I get , after two or three clear days at the beach . And stayed beside her in a house the wind can walk right through , I 've been there with you , far more than once , to see old Red at Christmas and Easter . Remember 1 told you her roof was bad and you sent a man out with brand-new tin , and Red sent me two big dressed chickens , ready to fry ? Red would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child she raised , a Negro that naturally thinks you 're God or , if she does n't , ca n't help herself ; ca n't make you leave ; may even die for knowing you , if you leave today and the trash get at her . <p> I 'd pray to die , if Curtis did n't need me . I 've asked the Lord if I can pray for you to die in battle soon , in some brave act that cancels this and lets us lift our heads and move on . But I get no more from God than from you  --  not a word , not a look . I go to church and sit there waiting . It might as well be one dim coffin with me nailed down , alive and stifling and beating the lid ; but nobody hears and no help comes . <p> The nights I 've lain awake and watched your pistol on the table , begging me to pick it up and drive the six miles out to Red 's and blow you and her to deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've cursed the marksman lesson you gave me . Remember that ? Remember anything we liked to do or pledged to keep on doing forever  --  like trusting , honoring , serving each other , come sun or storm ? <p> We were not back from the honeymoon for more than a month when you took me out that bright cold Sunday . I thought we were riding around , just looking . We passed the farm and waved at the tenants . I thought you 'd stop and give the children the Tootsie Rolls we bought in town . But you pushed on , not saying a word and finally took a sandy trail that sloped so steep downhill I thought we 'd be in water any minute , deep in . I remember quoting St. Paul to myself , " Love hopes all things , endures all things . " <p> I thought I was joking , whistling in the dark . And the sand did deepen till we nearly got trapped and you stopped cold in a thick bank of briars . I said " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes like some rank stranger . And that was the time I first had to think I 'd married a boy I 'd never met , much less really knew . <p> Finally you said " I want you to learn something useful for once . " You always laughed at my fund of knowledge . Remember telling my father that Christmas " Daph knows everything but how to breathe " ? You reached down under your edge of the seat and pulled out the pistol in a clean white rag . It looked as big as a cannon to me . ' Till then I had n't seen it  --  you 'd bought it that week . Strange as you looked , I did n't feel scared , just puzzled as always . You got out then and beckoned me on . And what did I do but follow behind you in two-inch heels for what seemed a mile of ruts and briars ? Then the brush stopped dead , we were in a wide clearing  --  the light was murky . <p> But you stood still , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpless pine . Then you reloaded and  --  still not meeting my eyes or speaking-you held it my way . <p> No choice but to take it . Well , I learned to shoot , at the same old tree . We must have killed it  --  maybe sixty rounds , most of them mine . Not a single miss . I could find the pine right now , if it 's there . <p> Were we on Mars ? Has any of this , these sixteen years , really happened , Kayes , or am I asleep ? I thought I 'd love you till both of us died . I thought it meant  --  the one weird day you taught me to shoot  --  that you had to love me . You wanted me , above all , to be protected in a world you already claimed was wild , though I did n't believe you yet awhile . <p> Even now , this close to Blackie 's face , I beg you to live and come on in . I can say your name . I can even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private mind , I can barely say home . Come back to where you promised to stay . Everybody will know it was nothing but a nightmare . Wake on up , Kayes . There may be time . <p> 5 The car was there , parked just off the road in a patch of young cedars . The path to Red 's ran uphill from it ; and by the time Daphne pulled to the shoulder , smoke was pouring from the chimney up there . For an instant she thought " They 've burnt it . " Then she thought " She 's burning up things of his . " But she knew both were wrong . And Curtis was reaching to open his door . So she said " I 'll drive on down to that sycamore , turn and then follow you on home . Drive slow and easy ; and if a patrolman stops you , I 'll explain you 're helping your mother out . " <p> Curtis had got his door wide open , and one leg was out . " Mother , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope I 'm near if you get stopped . " He finally looked back and halfway grinned . <p> But Daphne had seen a flash of green . The door of Red 's house had swung back silently ; and somebody wearing a bright green coat was standing there , at the top of the steps . A long brown skirt , tall , a lot of black hair . That moment , for some entirely strange reason , Daphne wanted to wave , to lean out the window and say " Step here please . " The idea scared her but still , to her wonderment , she felt no shock . She had not seen Blackie for twenty years maybe ; but now the memory of her face in childhood came to Daphne  --  such a pale child , more than normally serious with lovely hair , coarse and strong as an Indian 's . <p> By then Black had come down two of her steps . Two more and she 'd be in the yard , by the path . <p> Daphne said " Curt , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just unlock the car and be ready when I turn . You take the lead . " <p> Curtis shut the door gently and moved to the car . As he bent to unlock the door , Blackie gave a wide slow wave , took the last two steps and started toward him . <p> Then Daphne was scared but also angry . Curt must get out of this , with no more hurt or shame on his head . So she opened her door to meet what came . Blackie was no more than twenty yards off , looking down but still moving . <p> Curtis looked back with a heavy scowl . " I 'm serious , Mother . Go turn around and wait down there . " He pointed ahead to the white sycamore . And when his mother paused , he said again " Go ! Go straight home now . If anything 's wrong , I 'll hitchhike in . " <p> His power was so new that Daphne obeyed it . She went to the huge tree , backed around slowly ; and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing as still as horses , Daphne passed on by . <p> When the sound of her car had vanished , Leah said , " You got to be Curtis . " <p> " Yes ma 'm , I  --  " He felt his face burn and pointed to where his mother had gone . " I guess I 'm supposed to drive this home . <p> " Leah said " Was it his idea , your father 's ? " <p> " No ma 'm , she  --  " He pointed toward Daphne again . <p> Leah smiled a little and raised a hushing finger to her lips . " No need to call me ma 'm now , Curtis . I may be pale but I live with the niggers . " <p> He laughed , then flushed again  --  this was all wrong ; he was falling all over himself like a child . Finally he said " If this car 's yours , or anything in it , I 'll hitch right back . It do n't really matter . " Not thinking , he had switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrected him  --  " Does n't matter "  --  but renewed her smile . " I been to school , Curtis ; I did right well . " She leaned to see inside the car . The back seat was littered with Kayes 's farm papers , old catalogs , a pair of gray socks . " Not a thing of mine , nowhere in sight . " Her smile hung on . " You might be standing there , two or three days . This road is lonesome . " <p> Curtis nodded . " I know it . My father and I , we hunt out here . " They had not hunted for nearly two years . <p> Leah said " You know how much you look like him ? " Her hand carne up and touched her own face . <p> Curtis said " Exactly , before he changed . " <p> " How much has he changed ? " She asked sincerely , truly not knowing . <p> Somehow the boy felt stronger now , older and honest . He said " I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . " I mean all the years I 've known him , fourteen . " <p> Leah said " I knew him longer . My grandmother cooked for your grandmother . I was in her kitchen when he was a boy . " <p> Curtis said " I did n't know that . " It was only the truth , though even as he said it , he knew he could barely hear himself think . Nobody had dealt with him like this , in his whole life till now  --  this clean dead-level eye-to-eye truth . He knew he was being rammed forward through time . Any second now , he would be a grown man , tall enough to do what was right . But though they both stood waiting for a long time , nothing right or wrong , came to his mind . <p> At last Leah said " What if they say no and he comes back ? " <p> " Fine by me  --  " <p> " The car , I mean . What will he have to drive , if you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitch into town and get it . You do n't have a car ? " <p> Leah looked around as though she might . The only other machine in view was a dead old cookstove , flung in a ditch . She turned back to Curtis . " I do n't have good sense , much less a car , " She wanted to laugh but a hoarse bark came . She wiped her lips slowly with the back of her hand . <p> So Curtis said " Did he live here ? " He pointed uphill . <p> " Who ? " <p> " Mr. Kayes Paschal , the man we mentioned . " <p> Leah also looked behind , to the house , as if she had waked in another life and sought landmarks . And she spoke uphill , away from the boy . " He spent most nights for the past six months , ate a good many suppers , drank a whole world of coffee  --  " <p> " Hope the Army has coffee or he 'll desert . " <p> She said " They got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came out here to be mean , but tell me one thing please  --  what was this for ? " <p> At first Leah thought " He ca n't be a child . " Then she knew nobody but a child could have aimed it , that dead-eye straight . She said " You trying to kill me , fast ? " <p> " No , I 'm hoping to find my father . See , I 'm the one missed him all this time . " <p> Leah 's hand went out again  --  stop please now . Thank Jesus she 'd spent no time around children . " I wish I could answer , son . Did we hurt you bad ? " <p> " Bad . Yes . And I 'm his son . " He tried to ease it with a partial smile . <p> She took it full-face but had to wait . " Did me being colored make it worse on you ? " <p> Curtis knew at once and shook his head firmly . " It was you being in this world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for the time , Leah said " You want me to die right now ? " <p> He said " No . Not now  --  years ago , before I was born . " <p> " What about your mother ? " <p> He said " What about her ? " He had already noticed they had n't mentioned her . <p> " You do n't fault her for any of this ? " <p> Curtis said " Not more than fifty percent . " <p> Calm as she looked , this meeting had struck Leah harder than anything yet , anything her mind had bothered to store . She said " How would you be different now , if this had n't been ? " She also pointed back at Red 's house . <p> He tried to think . But all he could find was " At least I would n't be praying my father would head out to war and be shot dead . " <p> Her hand went up to her own open mouth . <p> Curtis nodded . <p> " Say no . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she shook it between them in the strong new light  --  the sky had cleared all through their talk . " Tell God right now you do n't mean that . " <p> Curtis said " I do n't . I meant to hurt you . " <p> Leah said " You did , man . Do n't worry , you did . " But he looked so much like her memory of Kayes  --  Kayes way back when  --  that she had to say " You hate me this much ? " <p> Curtis had heard her call him man . He all but smiled . " I 'd probably like you . I 'm an outgoing fellow . " <p> " But the way things happened put bad blood between us  --  " She read it as if it was printed plain on the hood of the car . <p> Curtis said " I guess . " He did not know yet , but his face was sliding back in time . He looked like a child again , tired and hungry . <p> Leah said " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came out here too fast . " <p> " I 'll cook you some eggs . " <p> He meant to say yes ; he could learn so much . But now he was young , he said " My mother is waiting for me . " <p> Leah said " If Kayes comes back , I 'll tell him you drove it . " She looked at him closely , the first time since they grappled so close . He looked even younger than he had at the start . " You sure you got a driver 's license ? " <p> Curtis said " No but that wo n't matter . All the young patrolmen are off killing Japs . These poor old fellows wo n't even see me . " <p> Leah nodded and walked a long five steps on the uphill path . Then she turned and said " I see you , Curtis . I wish I 'd seen you sooner than this . " <p> He said " No you do n't . I 'd have ruined your time . " He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smile once more but his mouth refused . <p> Back in the house , Leah went to the mirror and faced herself . No change , same eyes , same clean tight skin . She thought I 'm going to pack my duds and walk out of here , whoever comes back . I did n't set up to be this harmful . But the thought alone hurt as much as any words said this whole long day , that had only just started . In the glass she could also see behind her the neat-made bed where her grandmother died and she and Kayes had spent their nights . <p> In that empty space , above those pillows , they said things neither one had said elsewhere  --  Kayes promised her that . And where were they now ? The words anyhow were gone past hearing ; they had hurt as many people as they helped  --  she must get them out of her mind right now . Before she could turn away to pack , Leah faced herself a final moment . " Leave it all here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all through his peaceful ride back home , Curtis knew he had learned some large true thing that would lead him into a better life than he 'd known till now  --  less mess , less meanness , fewer people draining his life for blood . He tried to name his hard new knowledge ; he wanted to say it out loud in the car so he 'd never forget it . And he dug to find it but got no further than the words " I must  --  " <p> He pounded the wheel with both clenched hands and rode for more than a mile , feeling bad . But then he noticed how the sky had opened . The sun was strong as he eased into town ; and when he paused at the first stoplight , two country girls from his grade in school crossed the street before him  --  Willie and Flay . They were both already grown up front and had known , for months , things that still baffled him . So he knocked on the windshield and leaned his face well forward in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him , shrieked ; then waved and skipped faster , though they looked back , time and again , and talked a clear blue streak till he turned left and moved away  --  Curt Porter 's driving , like he 's got good sense when we know he ai n't . <p> 6 Kayes walked through the morning like a man still dreaming . When he entered the draft induction center , he found exactly the room he expected  --  a dim tall space , two-tone gray walls with benches and maybe a hundred men . Mostly boys , as he 'd imagined , all smoking like chimneys and nervous as squirrels . The obvious cause for worry was a sergeant , built like a concrete bunker and seated on a low platform in a kind of pulpit . Everybody tried not to notice him , Kayes included . So Kayes stopped inside the door , leaned on the wall and searched all the faces . Some of the boys looked younger than Curtis and were digging at their crotches , trying to laugh . Only when he hunted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A deep voice called his first two names , " Wilton Kayes . " An arm went up , a man half-stood ; and Lord , it was Brutus Bickford from grade school . <p> Kayes stepped over to him . " Brutus , they caught us . " <p> Brutus had grinned but now his face sobered . When Kayes was safely down beside him , he said " They ai n't catching me , I tell you . " He fumbled in his watch pocket , drew out a capsule not much bigger than a grain of rice , revealed it to Kayes , checked to see that the sergeant was turned away and then gulped it . <p> Kayes said " What will that do ? " <p> " You remember I had high blood pressure , do n't you ? " <p> High blood pressure in the third damned grade ? Still Kayes said " Sure , I forgot for a minute . " Wide as Brutus was , and dazed in the eyes , he looked like a calm rock bathed in the sun . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A friend of mine claims this pill guarantees me freedom today . " <p> Kayes thought " Well , death may amount to freedom  --  good luck , old son . " But he said " We 'll know in an hour , I guess . " <p> Brutus said " Kayes , Christ , when have I seen you ? " <p> To his surprise , Kayes knew , to the day . " The morning your mama pulled you out of Miss Allen 's class and left . The sixth grade , right after Easter Monday . Y'all moved up here , if memory serves . " <p> Brutus took it for granted that his past was remembered . He merely nodded and said " That bastard , Calvin Pepper  --  Mama said they were married , her third or fourth husband ; I still think they were just shacked up . Anyhow some scoundrel meaner than Cal took umbrage one Saturday night that summer and drilled Cal 's pea-brain with one clean shot , smack-dab right here . " Brutus tapped a huge finger between his blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a case of Pepsis with his cash and two bus tickets to Carolina Beach . " <p> " You still live there ? " <p> " Oh no . She may ; I come on back up here and been working . I got a young wife , and she 's got kids of her own to feed , so I 'm a plasterer and good at it too  --  let me lay you some walls . " Then he locked an unblinking stare on Kayes . " Where you been , Bo ? " <p> Kayes suddenly knew he would tell the truth , and it felt like a fruitful island discovered after months at sea . " I been living in the country with a Negro woman named Leah Birch , Red Birch 's niece . You remember old Red , mean as a snake ? " <p> Brutus said " I 've known very few niggers , Kayes . We could n't afford em and now I do n't care . " <p> Kayes took it peacefully , telling himself That 's a novel approach . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was nothing to say . <p> But after a wait , Brutus said " You love her ? " <p> Here was a whole new level of surprise . It seemed as unlikely as an angel visit . And a need to tell the truth was still strong . So Kayes said " I doubt I know what love amounts to . " <p> Brutus laughed . " Sure you do . You used to he smart . " <p> Kayes suddenly saw a new part of the afternoon when Brutus ' mother took him away . It was right after lunch ; and they were into rest time , hearing Miss Allen read Bob , Son of Battle . No warning at all , the hall door opened . And there stood a tall woman , dark purple dress , like a country girl with a big open face but confused in the eyes and with caked-on rouge . She did n't even speak to Miss Allen but looked round wildly and said " Where you at ? " Brutus sat two seats from Kayes ; and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dawn . She said " Hey , boy . We 're leaving out . " By then Miss Allen had summoned her wits and was asking questions . But all the woman would say was " No , he 's mine and we 're going . " <p> When Brutus had got his jacket from the cloakroom  --  his books were still inside his desk  --  he went to his mother but looked back at Kayes . And when Kayes half-waved , Brutus had to pretend he could n't see . His eyes flinched hard but then firmed up and never blinked , from then till the time she turned him and vanished . Kayes had thought before that the worst thing would be to have your father come to school drunk and call your name . But to have your mother come like this , a raucous gypsy-it shocked Kayes , even now , to see it . So he said to this big man beside him , " I hope I do . " In the midst of the words , Kayes wondered what in the world they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl ? " <p> How would Brutus know that ? " Legally , yes . " <p> Brutus laughed again , not mocking but in sympathy . " That 's what matters , ai n't it ?  --  that thin piece of paper . They can slice you with that worse than any bullwhip . " <p> Kayes tried to smile and skate on through it . " They got you over miles of barrels , all right . " He wondered how many wives Brutus had left , but he knew not to ask . The sergeant had picked up a clipboard and was standing . <p> Brutus said " You 're praying he takes you , I bet . " By then his face was a new shade of red ; the pill was working . <p> The sergeant said " Alphabetize yourselves . " The alphabet was strung round the walls on dingy cards . A lot of the boys were baffled by the order , and Kayes was trying to smile at that . <p> Brutus spotted the B and pointed to it , but he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that money would n't fix . How dark is she , Bo ? " <p> Kayes said " Light as me . " <p> Brutus said " Then you 're waist-deep in cow pies , ai n't you ? " But he did n't explain and before Kayes could ask , he whispered " Look , I 'm not feeling so good . If I stroke out here , tell the doc what happened and send my regrets . " <p> Kayes said " Be glad to . " <p> Brutus laughed and went . <p> Half an hour later when Kayes got upstairs , naked as a newt in a line of men in similar trouble , huddled there in a corner was a ring of doctors around a cot . As Kayes worked through a set of chores for medics  --  kneeling , bending , exposing his ass and throat and coughing  --  he came near enough to see the cot . Brutus was laid out naked too , pink as a shrimp with a blood-pressure sleeve on and two doctors , each one holding a wrist . Brutus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed himself with that one pill . He figured the doctors did n't know names , so he said " Brutus " firmly . <p> Brutus looked up and found Kayes near . Hot as he was , for a long moment Brutus tried to look solemn . But then he checked on the doctors-they were busy  --  so he winked at Kayes . <p> Kayes lifted a finger and smiled . But through the rest of the next half-hour , in other rooms , he went on seeing Brutus two ways  --  the boy leaving school and the clown on the cot , swollen with blood , gambling with death . And when he had done all the shameful stunts they forced on his body and another sergeant had looked down a list and said " So Paschal , you 're found fit to serve , " Kayes walked away with a stinging surge of raw grief in his eyes and mind . Over and over , he told himself what he thought was the truth . With all the pain he had on his own  --  the people he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now was for no <p> one or nothing but Brutus Bickford years ago , a twelve-year-old boy run like a wind-up doll by a whore . <p> 7 Twenty minutes later , dressed and calm , Kayes got his turn in a dark phone booth . He paid for the first call , to Riley 's house . Riley would hardly be home yet ; and though his wife had let Kayes know she despised his face , he could tell her at least that now he was boarding a bus to Fort Jackson and basic training . That should satisfy her so much she might unbend enough to say his name , which had not crossed her lips since the night he left home . <p> But Riley answered on the second ring with a slow " Riley Paschal . " <p> Kayes seized up again but cleared his throat . " Sir , this is Dog-Soldier Paschal , reporting . " <p> Riley said " Oh God  --  " <p> " They 're herding us onto a bus any minute now , for South Carolina . <p> I passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll write you from down there , soon as I can . " <p> Riley said " Kay , call me , night or day . And call collect ; that 'll make it go faster . " He needed a long pause . " You bearing up ? " <p> " I plan to live . " <p> Riley said " Do n't say it . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Just do n't make claims . This is one show run by others now . " Kayes chuckled . " I recently got that impression . " <p> " What can I send you ? You 're bound to need something . " <p> Kayes said " I 've got my shaving kit . They throw in the clothes at camp , I guess . " <p> " Sure , you 'll have a full khaki wardrobe , down to the handkerchiefs . I just meant  --  what ?  --  snacks , playing cards , writing paper , a Bible with one of those bulletproof covers . " <p> Kayes said " Could you ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pardon ? " <p> " A head , in good working order . I could bolt it right on . " <p> Riley said " Got a headache ? " <p> The joke bad failed . Kayes paused to say it right . " You remember I asked for one more favor . " <p> " I do indeed . " <p> " Will you please do it soon ? " <p> Riley said " You think she 'll still be there ? " <p> " I guarantee it . " <p> " Then what do I say ? I do n't want to tell her too much , good or bad . " Riley might have been contemplating trade with the stars ; he was that far out of his element . <p> But Kayes stayed calm . " Just tell her the news  --  I 'm gone ; I 've already told her the rest . Then see if she wants you to drive her somewhere , in reason , today . She 'd never use mine and you scared me a little there , mentioning trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know Red 's got those peculiar nieces on the Alston farm , the ones with orange hair . They 'd take Leah in , for a few days at least . She 'll run it from there . " <p> Riley said " Red 's house is Black 's now , do n't forget . I ca n't make her leave . Far as we 're concerned , she can stay on there till the roof falls in or she 's dead  --  one . " <p> Kayes said " That may be any day now . " He knew he was suddenly past understanding himself . <p> " You want her to stay ? " Riley spoke with the cool authority of a good secretary , taking dictation . <p> Kayes had never asked his brother 's advice in this before . But the desolation of an airless phone booth forced him on . " What if I say yes , keep her there till I 'm back ; set her up in style ? " Riley knew at once . " I 'd say you were cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked sooner  --  Riley would never volunteer a judgment ; but ask him and you got it , full blast , both barrels in the mouth . " Bud , is that all I 've been up to now ? " <p> Riley said " I prize you too much , Kay , to answer that . I think you did what you wanted to . I know you watched where you put your feet . You saw who you crushed . And I doubt you pressed anybody too weak to bear your weight . " <p> Kayes said " Curtis . " <p> Riley said " Well , Curt  --  " and he paused too . <p> Kayes knew he could not take up the slack yet . And in that instant , the smell of boys ' feet and the scurf of this old phone 's mouthpiece hit his empty gut . He swallowed hard at a gob that rose to his tongue and teeth . <p> Riley said " You and Daphne have swamped that boy . You owe him and me a careful war , Kay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make him a father for a few more years . " <p> " Perfect , " Kayes thought . " Thank Jesus for Riley . " But all he said was " Bud , my ass comes in halves like yours . " <p> Riley said " I wore my ass off years ago , dragging after you . " <p> Kayes said " I love you . " <p> Riley said " Ditto . " <p> Kayes took ten seconds to crack the door , draw a deep breath and ask the next boy in line for two minutes . Then he dialed the operator and placed a call , collect to Curtis Paschal . The ring went on till he almost quit , though he could n't imagine the maid at least was n't home to answer . <p> Then it stopped , a long wait  --  Kayes thought it was dead  --  and Daphne spoke . When the operator asked for Curtis , she said " Curtis Paschal is n't here . I 'll accept the charges if your party has a message . " <p> Kayes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through that prologue , he could barely listen for the shock he felt in hearing a voice he had all but forgot , a voice he had once loved near to distraction  --  what ?  --  two or three seconds ago in his life . Time felt that short ; his whole sorry life felt five minutes long . So he said " Operator , I 'll talk with the lady , if she accepts . " <p> Daphne said " Surely " and the operator vanished . <p> " Daphne , it looks like I 'm in the Army . " <p> " I 'm sorry , Kayes . " She meant it , though she had not thought of the ways . <p> " Curt 's gone , you say ? " <p> " Right now , " she said . " He 's out at old Red 's place , getting the car . " <p> Blood flooded into Kayes 's eyes and mind but he knew to wait . Then he said " That ca n't have been Curt 's idea . " <p> " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody else yet . " Her voice was level , no glint of meanness , just the facts to-date . <p> Kayes said " But what if I 'd got back tonight ? " <p> " The car would have been yours the instant you asked . " <p> He waited again . <p> So Daphne said " I 'm sorry you 're mad . " <p> " Oh Jesus , I 'm not . I 'm standing here though , trying not to break . " <p> Daphne said " I know . Think how I 'd have felt if that girl drove your car up here and knocked on the door or left it in the yard . " <p> Kayes said " She 's a full-grown woman , Daph , with manners the equal of any I 've known . Red raised her , remember , the same as me . " <p> " Your manners  --  yes , well . " Then she heard that they 'd come , one more sad time , to the place where every speech was a blade they forced each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some word for Curt ? " " just the news  --  the government wants his dad for a while . <p> I 'll be in South Carolina by dark and will write him a letter as soon as they let me . " <p> " I 'll tell him , Kayes . " She seemed to be writing the actual words . " Will you go overseas ? " <p> " May well . This war is far from won . " <p> " We 'll both pray for you . " <p> " Can you do that ? " <p> Daphne thought , to be certain . " I have n't stopped yet . I married you  --  yesterday , it feels like now . " Then she almost laughed . " It 's hardly likely I 'd cease to care . " <p> " Can you say how much ? " He amazed himself . <p> " No , not here , not down a phone wire . " <p> Riley was right ; he had n't broke Daphne . So he honored her pride and said " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a rotten  --  no  --  I 'm the youngest boy in this whole building , and that 's a big claim , it 's a poor damned excuse , but I swear it feels true . " He knew nothing else . <p> She said " I 'm so old , I knew Elijah . " And she thought " Where in God 's name did that come from ? " She found herself laughing . <p> Kayes joined in , glad for the first time in days . <p> But before he could say a decent good-bye , she was gone , hung up . <p> He spoke her name twice to the dead receiver , then hung up also , clamped his eyes to flush the pain and opened the booth . To the tall young Negro patiently waiting , he said " I wish you better luck , friend . " <p> The solemn black face nodded but said " If I get it , be the first time I smelled luck . " <p> Kayes wanted to stand , like a steer in the road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . But he looked for the bus door and soon found a sign for " Loading Dock . " Those wide red double doors had to be it . Three boys that looked a bare fifteen were pushing through , grinning . For a long moment , Kayes saw their skulls and how they looked in the graves they would find , no time from now . <p> 8 By four that afternoon , Curtis and Cally his only real friend had shot three squirrels and a rabbit between them . They would head on in by dark , skin the catch and take it to the freezer-locker plant where they were storing the fall and winter meat for a stew to serve their grade at school on an early-spring picnic . But while the light was as good as this , they sat on a broad flat rock by the creek and watched the creatures they had spared for now . <p> Cally watched anyhow ; he suspected Curt was not seeing much . Beyond the water was a chattering flock of starlings that a full cyclone could hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies through the woods like handfuls of fat black seed ; then walked around like important Negroes , casing the leaves . <p> Cally knew that today was touchy for Curt , and Curt had not met his eyes for hours , so he finally took the risk and spoke . " You see your pa off ? " <p> Curtis nodded . " Yesterday . " <p> " Will he let you know if they draft his ass ? " <p> " No , Cal . He 'll just vanish off like a ghost . He do n't give a shit . " <p> The voice was so hard , and the fury behind it , that Cally thought Curt meant all he said  --  he hated his father for living with a nigger and was glad to lose him . They 'd said very little about this , through these past six months ; but with Curt not caring now , maybe he could ask . Cal said " You ever get a look at that girl ? " <p> " What girl ? " <p> " Blackie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Curtis faced around with eyes blank as washers . And he waited about a month to speak  --  it felt that long anyhow to both boys . " I spent a good part of this morning with her . " <p> " No . " <p> Curtis swore in silence , with his hand up between them . <p> Cally had known Curt all his life . Even with rifles beneath their hands , he knew he was safe . " You feel like telling ? " <p> Curtis looked off again , back toward the starlings but still blankeyed . Then he passed his left hand over all he saw . " I feel like wiping out everything but me . " His right hand dug in the dead rabbit 's fur , as if for gold . <p> Cally said " You 'd wipe out everything  --  the WACs and nurses and General MacArthur ? " He had always served as Curt 's private jokester . But Curt nodded fiercely . <p> " Present company included ? " <p> Curtis stood up suddenly ; the starlings lifted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet on the rock . Throughout what came , he kept on hurling rocks at the birds , who hardly noticed . " I flat-out liked her . I saw the damned point . " <p> " In him living with her ? Leaving you and your mother to live with a nigger in a one-room shack ? " <p> " Your mother did n't tell you that word was trash ? " <p> Cally said " Sure but I figure she 's earned it  --  that Blackie girl . " <p> " She 's old enough to be your mother . " <p> " Thank Christ she ai n't . " When Curt said nothing , Cal tried again . " You 're bound to know what people are saying . " <p> " People are what I 'm wiping out , when my time comes . " <p> Cally said " Halt , when 's that going to be ? " <p> " Me and God only know . " <p> " You think any white girls will go with you now-down the road , I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said " I screw my own right hand . It 's free and it 's safe , never hurt nobody . " <p> " How about your friend God ? He claims it 's a sin . " <p> Curtis said " Friend God has said He loves my ass , right down to the ground . I bet He forgives me . " <p> " I wo n't stand by you on Judgment Day though ; I might get singed . " <p> " Cally , you were jacking off four times a day , when I thought dicks were plumbing fixtures . " <p> " You know better now . " <p> Curtis said " I know they 've caused more trouble than Adolf Hitler and the Japanese Navy . " 0 <p> Cally said " Not mine . Mine 's good to me . " <p> " You wait . " Curtis put both hands to his mouth and threw a long shout to the trees beyond them . It was not a word ; but it seemed to have meaning , though no one bird paid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd killed and , one by one , pitched each one gently toward the deepest pool of the creek below them . Then he bent for Cal 's rifle and stood a long moment . He thought Pray Jesus do n't let him speak . I might go wild . <p> But Cally sat still as the rock beneath them , still watching the pool where the squirrels had sunk . For some weird reason the rabbit 's head was floating still . <p> When it finally sank , Curtis started back to a home he 'd rather have died , here now , than see again . <p> Cally spoke out strong enough to carry . " I 'm still what I 've always been to you , hear ? " <p> Curtis never looked back . <p> " That 's my damned rifle . " <p> Curt said " Come get it . " But he thought " Die , fool " and kept on going , hoping he would see , sometime between this minute and the grave , one narrow path in the thicket ahead that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the road just before five . He saw at once that the car was missing , and he naturally thought that Blackie was gone . But smoke was rising from the chimney still ; and since the house might burn if the stove was lit , he got out and headed up the hill . Before he had gone six feet , up there the door opened ; and Blackie was standing  --  it had to be her , right age and color , though Riley had n't seen her since Red 's funeral-day and then just a glimpse , when her eyes were down . <p> She watched him come another three steps , then put a hand to her mouth , turned back and shut the door . <p> Riley saw a good stick beside the path and leaned to get it , in case of dogs . Since childhood Riley had dreaded dogs ; and Red kept a rough old mongrel that could be here . Dogs hated strange skin color worse than people did . But he got to the front steps with no mishap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window at least . When a quiet minute passed , he called out " Hey ? " No answer , nothing . So he climbed the rickety steps and knocked . Absolute silence , a far-off crow , cars on the highway two miles west . He tried the china doorknob  --  open . So he entered slowly . <p> The room was dark but he stood on the sill and let his eyes open . Then sitting there on Red 's old bed was a woman , fine hair and skin , with eyes big as saucers . He said " Is it Blackie ? It 's been a long time . " <p> " Leah Birch , " she said . " You called me Blackie when we used to play . " Riley covered the distance and held out his hand . <p> She stood and met it  --  her own palm was cold . Then she went past him and stood by the stove . " I know they took him . " <p> Riley could hear she was sealing a fact , not asking for news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to Raleigh that morning and Kayes 's phone call  --  no mention of the will . <p> She heard him out , with hardly a move , both her hands flat down on the stove as if it was cool or she was iron . But even when Riley said that Kayes had asked him to drive her to her cousins ' for safety , she never budged , shed a tear or spoke . Even as the stillness grew in the room , she stayed there upright frozen inside . <p> Riley saw Kayes 's watch on her wrist . What else ? How much more of his brother would walk out of here , if she left now ? He did n't mean theft , just sad curiosity . Like others , he noticed when Kayes stopped wearing his wedding ring . Where was that for instance  --  in his shaving kit ? What chance did it have when this all ended , Blackie up North and the war truly won ? He told himself he was wasting time . And at last he spoke to Blackie again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not said what he was sorry for  --  that Kayes was gone with four people hurt , that this here was ended or that Black must scuttle in the cold dusk now like a wanted thing . That far , Riley was truthful with himself and her  --  he did not know what he meant and might never . <p> Still no move from Blackie ; was she drunk or doped ? So he said " Kayes is gone , to parts mysterious . That much we know . He and I talked about you as kind as we could . We think you may be in trouble here , if you try to stay on  --  all the mean old boys are n't dead yet , Leah . So I 'll be glad to drive you on to your cousins ' place or even the bus station now , while it 's light . But listen , it 's over . This time here at least . " <p> Of all wild things , she broke out smiling ; and her lips came open but still no words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed . <p> He looked behind him and there on the floor was a cardboard suitcase , a green umbrella , a bright green coat and a mannish hat . " Good . I 'll take these down to the car . But first let 's see if the stove is safe . " <p> " Safe . I looked . " <p> Why had that broke her loose ? Whyever , Riley knew he must trust her . If the place burned down , and the brush all round it , he must not doubt her now . He saw into Leah 's clenched mind that far . He took up the suitcase and said " I guess you 'll wear that hat . " Then he thought of the dog . " Red 's old dog  --  is he still alive ? " <p> " He was way too old , and nobody round here to take care of him . I killed him , this morning . Buried out back . " She pointed through the wall . <p> " Killed him ? How ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached up and tapped the crown of her skull . <p> " Red never had a gun . " <p> Leah nodded . " Did . Your grandmother gave it to her , week before your grandma died . " <p> " Where is it now , Black ? " <p> " In your hand . In that suitcase . " <p> " Is it loaded still ? " <p> She nodded . " Five shots . " <p> " Can I open the bag and take out the bullets ? You keep them on you , just not in the gun . " <p> " I 'll do it . " She stayed there but held out her hand . <p> So Riley stepped over and gave her the suitcase . <p> She took it with both hands and looked hard at him . " Riley , please go on down and wait . I wo n't keep you . " <p> At first he thought she wanted the privacy to open her things ; so he stepped out and was halfway down before he thought Oh God , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . If it came , he knew the sheriff would believe him  --  no risk for him . But for everybody 's sake , he hoped she 'd live . The sight of her hair came now to his eyes , in beautiful waves . He actually spoke , " No , Black . Go easy . " <p> By the time he reached the car , there had been no sound . So he stood on the far side there and waited . The light was leaking away fast now , and a chill was rising . By then he was thinking it might be fate  --  he believed more nearly in fate than God , some blind hand liable to thrust in the dark . And nothing behind him , in all his life , told Riley who to blame . He thought they had each done the natural thing , every soul involved . Nobody had set out to strew blood and pain . Nobody was wrong but he knew who lost  --  everybody in sight , Black and Curtis the most . What was taking so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would break whatever spell they were under , that barred them apart while each one waited for life or death . With both hands up to his mouth , Riley called out " Leah ? " twice . <p> And at once she was there in the door , climbing down . Even this late , the green coat looked like spring on the way . The hat was far on the back of her head , and it made her look tall as the nearest pine . She had left the umbrella but clutched the suitcase . <p> Whatever he believed , Riley said " Thank you . " Then he went to help her , the little he could . <p> When he met her halfway down the path , she held out the bag ; and when he took it , his hand brushed hers . To himself Riley said " It was simple as that "  --  he meant the tie between her and Kayes . What else was it for but two human skins , together awhile ? It was not a mean or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been here . Now- it was over . In all his years , Riley had touched no woman but his homely wife . And though his mind , even now , could drift in warm spring weather , no one yet had drawn him toward her  --  God knew , none here . This pitiful soul with no home to take her and skin that was four strikes against her , wherever . Again he thought " Just let the pain fade . " He mostly found that was all you could hope for . <p> They reached the car . Riley opened the trunk and put in her suitcase . It did n't weigh six pounds ; was this all she owned ? Surely she had things stored up North . He knew he had a twenty-dollar bill ; he 'd give her that much . <p> By the time he got to the driver 's door , Leah had seated herself in back , the usual seat for Negro women bound home from work . <p> Riley almost asked her to sit up front , no harm in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought he could see that her eyes were closed . He cranked the engine and looked again . By then the eyes were open but fixed ; so he said in the gentlest voice he could manage " Which is it  --  the bus or your cousins ' place ? " <p> She waited . " Riley , I just do n't  --  " She stopped , dug into a pocket of her coat and brought out a quarter . She cupped both hands to make a tumbler and shook the coin for a long ten seconds , saying " Heads is the bus . " Then she opened her hands and looked . " Heads it is . " <p> " The bus station then ? " <p> " That 'll be a first step . " She still looked down , talking to the coin . Riley said " To Wilmington , Delaware ? " <p> " Or North Hell , Arkansas . I 'll know when I get there . " She suddenly laughed . <p> He tried to join her . " You sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a little . " <p> Leah said " I 'm richer than you know , Riley . I could buy me a ticket from here to the moon , if the notion struck me . " <p> " Let it strike . Shoot fire !  --  that 's a fine idea . " He turned back , grinning at the change of tone . <p> And Leah nodded to him but said " Easy , child . We 're all too sad . Let 's show some respect . " <p> Riley also nodded , then backed out slowly . By the time they stopped at the first crossroads , it was pitch-black night , that soon and final , the dark of the moon . <p> 10 At that same time a long way south , Kayes woke in a dim bus among boys , mostly asleep and dreaming . He checked the watch of the gaunt lad beside him and saw that somehow he had slept two hours . Then he checked his mind  --  no dreams he recalled , no blameful faces . But then the stifling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again . He shut his eyes and , for the first time , asked to know what he could do to heal some part of the lives he 'd crushed  --  his wife and son and Leah Birch . <p> Curtis and Daphne at least stood together and shared the weight . But the sight in his mind of Leah alone hurt too bad to watch , even here far off . So he silently asked her face for pardon ; no sound came . Why in God 's name should it ? He knew there was no least hope of pardon till Riley could write and say she was gone , was safe again working and fed somewhere up North where people , at worst , would just ignore her . <p> It could be a long wait . How could he last through it ?  --  well , minute by minute like all the pain a grown man causes . How could she ? Kayes tried to imagine her mind , a thing he had never attempted before . Even as a young boy , he thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he could read all Daphne 's thoughts ; it was part of why be had to leave  --  she ached too much every time he touched her . <p> But part of Leah had stayed shut to him , the part of her mind that planned for him . He was almost sure it had nothing to do with her color ; he had known old Red like an easy book . ( Among what Kayes could not know here was that , trusting him with her actual life , Leah was forced against her will to hide and damp her hope and dread . ) So now he cleared his mind , leaned back again and asked for strength to wait in patience , for the grace to recognize and make all due amends as time cooled down . He sat for a long dry spell in the dark . But no help landed , no word , no clue but the moaning breath of the boy beside him . <p> In the orange shine of the aisle light , Kayes reached to his own feet , found his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beggar . Finally , under a damp washrag , he found the ring that Daphne gave him , before God and man , the day they were married fifteen years ago . He knew it would be wrong to wear it now , wrong to all concerned , a sorry joke . But vain as all his prayers had been , this empty circle might hold inside it his only chance of coming back whole from this new danger and starting over in decency . <p> He knew the notion was maybe childish , maybe wild as Brutus risking his life on a dynamite pill . Still he checked to see that no one watched . Then he brought the gold to his lips and slid it under his tongue . For all the last miles to this next place , it stayed there , hard and bitter but hot . He hoped there would be a place at the camp , some vault or locker , to hide it . <p> But what Kayes knew  --  all he knew tonight  --  was a harder fact than a golden ring or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be parts of a riding dream ) . This much was true  --  he had spent from eight to twenty-four hours a day , these six months , beside a kind intelligent person who fit against his mind and body , and chose to fit , in every way a sane human being would pray to find this side of death . She was one real woman named Leah Birch  --  whatever her color or the size of her house  --  who had finally cared so deep and steady as to all but fill the gully cut in him by his beautiful mother when she heard his prayers one December night and kissed his cheek and then left him forever by morning . Now Lee was gone too . He had run them both off . <p> Who else on Earth will ever risk Kayes Paschal again ? <p> 11 Five hours later , home from the picture show and asleep , Curtis told himself the night 's first story , a dream to mend as much as he could in his own cut mind . This boy and I are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a big picnic  --  plates on all sides , chicken bones . All but us have gone on home , but we stand here and face the sunset . I tell him we ought to watch till it 's gone , completely night . He says well no , then we 'll never get down . But I can see he 's not really scared ; he just may not want to scramble in the dark . I think it 's because he 's older than me , more dignified . At least he 's taller and his eyes blink less . I want his company so I fall in with him as he leaves too . <p> He was right . Before we 're halfway down , the light is too thin to see the rocks and gullies beneath us . I ca n't even see him clear ahead . Pretty soon I 'm scared but I feel my way by listening to where he puts his feet . Before long though , even they fade off . I 'm feeling my way with bleeding hands , from root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so deep gone in the dark , and losing blood , that I think " I 'm going to yell . He 's bound to come . " But Lord , I ca n't remember his name ; so I do stop there in the miserable dirt and call my own name , more than once . <p> Then something pulls my messed-up hands . I ca n't even see them , but I feel the tug . And then there seems to be a new light , way above me . I 'm not even sure which way up is , but I take a chance . And yes , my friend  --  is he still my friend ?  --  is flying there in a kind of fire that he seems to throw as he moves , like a falling star . But he rises . He rises in slow perfect circles  --  he knows the way or is climbing to find it  --  and after a while , I can barely see . I think he goes that far to catch the last daylight , and I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurts my hands . My friend is moving now like a kite , and I 've got the string . It 's a thick plaited line and is almost gone , so I grab at it while I still have time . And recalling kites and how not to lose them , I reel him toward me turn by turn till , sure , he 's back on the ground in reach . But his back is turned . By now I 'm guessing it 's Kayes somehow . Once he moves though , he 's dark again and I ca n't know . Still I feel the line draw tight once more , and I guess he 's tugging me on back down . Without even knowing his face or voice , I try to bet he 's taking me home . <p> Even as the dream threaded Curt 's mind and drew him on , in a whole cool room of his understanding , he saw he was dreaming , saw he was easing himself ahead with childish hope . Yet in that same room , he had watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curt even shouted his thanks to the arms that worked in pure dark now  --  or so he trusted . At the least , that sight of a useful father let Curt sleep till Sunday daylight , clear and dry with slow church bells , the first whole day of his grown man 's life . <p> <p> By REYNOLDS PRICE <p>
