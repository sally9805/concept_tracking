The Air Force has been grumbling about a lack of funds . So why has n't it been keeping a closer eye on its petty cash ? Embarrassing case in point : an audit of the publicly funded renovations to the Air Force Academy 's Carlton House , home of the academy 's head , LIEUT . GENERAL TAD OELSTROM . <P> The service 's auditors found that the cost of the kitchen renovation  --  estimated at $151,000  --  had ballooned to $308,000 . That 's steep , since taxpayers had paid to remodel the kitchen in 1988 . And 1968 . And 1958 . <P> Apparently , the place needed " seamless Corian countertops . " That boosted the price 17% . And then there 's the dishwasher that does a load in 90 seconds . It cost $4,717 . Installation of the dishwasher incurred an additional $12,479 . " Justification for this type of dishwasher , " the auditors noted , " was not documented . " <P> Academy officials say the 1930s-era home is often host to public gatherings that require a big kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they moved by the Air Force 's official grounds for the remodeling  --  that " the area is always hot , the lighting is poor , the refrigerator is not functional for a family . " Sort of makes the $2.4 billion B-2 bomber seem like a steal . <P>  --  By Mark Thompson/Washington
