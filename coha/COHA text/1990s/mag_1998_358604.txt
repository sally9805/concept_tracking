Opposites attract . If we did n't believe that slightly dubious premise , our culture  --  not to mention our inner lives  --  would be infinitely poorer : no Wuthering Heights , no Bringing Up Baby . On the other hand , to be strictly fair , had we been spared that thought we would also have been spared Abie 's Irish Rose and Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner ? You win some , you lose some . <P> Right now in the realm of movie romance , we 're on a major losing streak . For we live in a world where all the old dramatically and comedically interesting barriers to love 's fulfillment have tumbled . Class , race , religion , all the things that used to keep a man and woman apart until the final reel  --  and even sometimes through eternity  --  have lost their potency . Or , to put the point a little more carefully , in a time when the very idea that society actually contains implacable opposites is  --  smokers and nonsmokers aside  --  officially discouraged , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause to potential lovers . <P> You 'd think maybe sexual preference might have some potential in this regard . Wendy Wasserstein , the playwright , obviously does . She 's been trying to get an adaptation of Stephen McCauley 's novel The Object of My Affection off the ground for something like a decade . It offers a gay guy named George ( Paul Rudd ) getting jilted , taking a room with a straight woman named Nina ( Jennifer Aniston ) and having them fall into , yes , affection . On her part , though , that develops into something a little more intense , especially when she contrasts his sweetness to the abrasiveness of her straight lover , Vince ( John Pankow ) . Those feelings grow when she discovers that she 's pregnant and that George is a much more supportive prenatal companion than Vince . Maybe , she thinks , he 'd be a better father too . As for sex , well , as someone once said , nobody 's perfect . And George does encouragingly tell her that he once had a not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddle , especially since Wasserstein provides the couple with all kinds of complications . She has rich , interfering relatives ( Alan Alda and the divinely bitchy Allison Janney ) . He soon has a new gay flame ( Amo Gulinello ) whose worldly-wise longtime companion ( wonderfully portrayed by Nigel Hawthorne ) gets hurt as hard as Nina does . But it 's also too much of a muddle . There is no logical way to arrange the kind of romantic reconciliation the writer , director ( Nicholas Hytner ) and we desperately want to enjoy . For neither Wasserstein nor Rudd quite wants to come to grips with the fact that George , despite his sweet smiles , is a careless , selfish man . Eliding the consequences of that problem , Wasserstein turns the whole bunch into an extended family  --  even adding a sweet-souled black policeman to the mix as Nina 's consolation prize . Wasserstein can spritz New York-smart talk with the best of them , but she ca n't make us believe this mass conversion to sociopolitical correctness , with everybody loving and forgiving everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another remain essentially unresolved .
