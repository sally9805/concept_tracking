<p> Scientist Rick Stevens hands each of a dozen visitors what look like oversize Ray Ban sunglasses as they step into the next-generation Internet , the granddaddy of all computer networks . <p> Yes , they literally walk into a room and are surrounded by three-dimensional images generated by a computer . The system at Argonne National Laboratory is one of the first trials to put 3-D virtual reality on line . Some people who worked on the original Internet say this is what comes next . It 's the technology that masses of people will use after today 's red-hot World Wide Web - the most popular area of the Internet - becomes as passe as Pong . <p> It is astonishing . The system can make computer-animated fish swim around your legs , then rush to nibble cartoon food dropped from a hand-held wand . It can let people thousands of miles apart design a full-scale car together , walk around it , look under the hood . Someday , systems like this may let a grandfather play with his grandchild who lives in another city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other - like a whole-person video phone call . <p> The 3-D room , called the CAVE - short for Cave Automatic Virtual Environments - is a big step into the future . Connecting them is a bigger step . There are CAVEs at General Motors , Cornell University and a few other places , including the National Center for Supercomputing Applications . <p> USA TODAY was allowed to join an exclusive demonstration of the Argonne CAVE for telecommunications companies and potential users , including Ford and McDonald 's . Ford is looking at it to design cars without building expensive prototypes . McDonald 's might use the system to design restaurants , train staff or entertain patrons . <p> This month , the federal government plans to announce support for the project . In December , at the Supercomputer ' 95 trade show in San Diego , Argonne and collaborators plan to end a year-long rush to build the technology by putting on a major public demonstration . <p> " It 's such a right time to do this , and it 's within our grasp , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supercomputing Applications . He was a member of the group that created the NSFnet , now the Internet , a global computer network of some 20 million users . Computer and communications scientists , he says , " are gravitating to this now . " <p> The system starts with Argonne 's CAVE . It looks like a 10-foot-square white room with one missing wall . Actually , the walls are projector screens . Surround-sound speakers hang in each corner . The CAVE is connected to an IBM supercomputer system that takes up a room itself . The whole thing can pump information into the CAVE at 10,000 times the speed of a Pentium personal computer hooked to a 14,400-baud modem . <p> Stevens asks the technicians to turn on the CAVE and a blurry image of a machine-shop floor and a computer-generated grinding machine comes up on all the walls . Visitors are asked to put on the glasses . Each pair has a tiny infrared sensor on the bridge . It reads an unseen beam bouncing around inside the cave to coordinate the image with the glasses , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the glasses , and the image pops into crystal-clear 3-D all around . <p> The glasses are n't the blinding goggles of most virtual reality systems . Participants can still see each other as if they were looking through regular sunglasses . There are no earphones . Sound comes from speakers . Several people in a CAVE could interact and collaborate . <p> One person in the CAVE wears glasses that have a slender ear-to-ear band that spans the head . On top is a tiny magnetic tracking device that tells the computer where the person is in the room . <p> Put on those glasses , take hold of the wand - kind of a 3-D mouse - and you control the CAVE . In the machine-shop demo , you can turn on the machine and run materials through it and change the angle or speed of the grinding wheel . You can walk around the machine to see it from the back , in 3-D . You can even stick your head under the wheel - probably not what engineers had in mind when creating this test project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost as intuitive as walking around in real life . " As you 're playing with it , you 're actually driving a supercomputer , which is not something most people get to do , " Stevens says . <p> The visitors ooh and ahh as Stevens changes the CAVE simulation to put them inside a gigantic electromagnet , watching atomic particles fly past . In the real world , no one could go inside such a magnet or see such particles . But the CAVE lets engineers change the magnet 's design and see how particles react . It also could let engineering students see and understand high-tech magnet design in ways never before possible . <p> Finally , Stevens turns on the fish tank . Some of the animated fish look like airplanes with gills , making the visitors chuckle . All the fish are in striking 3-D , swimming at all different depths and angles . <p> The year-long project to connect CAVES is called I-WAY , for Information Wide Area Year . I-WAY members have run multi-CAVE tests , but widespread networks that can handle such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why companies such as Pacific Telesis and Sprint were invited here . <p> The I-WAY project is a serious drive to make virtual reality communications happen . Some early applications could be amazing , says Mary Spada of Global Growth Strategies , a consultant to I-WAY . One is virtual firefighter training . A supercomputer could be programmed to run the sessions . CAVEs in major cities could connect to that computer and let recruits learn how to fight an almost-real fire without risk . <p> During a lunch break , two executives from McDonald 's - both eating salads - talk about how their company might use connected CAVEs . Besides designing restaurants , McDonald 's might use it to train employees . " We could put somebody in a CAVE and simulate a situation ( like an angry customer ) and let him or her react to it , " says Patrick Krause of McDonald 's computer department . <p> Eventually , smaller , portable devices might be able to project 3-D virtual reality images the way the cumbersome CAVE does now . Such devices , Krause says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kids ' first experience with virtual reality , and it would be associated with McDonald 's . " <p> Argonne 's Stevens , sitting next to the McDonald 's guys , adds that professional couples who travel a lot might like to go to restaurants that can put a 3-D screen across the table and connect it back home . " Have dinner with your virtual reality spouse , " he says , not at all joking . <p> That kind of stuff may be more than a decade away . But clearly , on-line virtual reality is moving forward . Fifty-six applications are being developed for the I-WAY project . Some are esoteric science , but others are like the one from Caterpillar , which may use CAVEs to develop construction vehicles . " We 're not too sure exactly how or where all this technology ought to be used , but we think it 's promising and we want to stay on the forefront of learning about it , " says Caterpillar 's Kem Ahlers . <p> In April , MCI unveiled a super-network called vBNS , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also might handle CAVE connections and begin creating the next Internet . " Too many view the Internet as the end-all , " says MCI chief engineering officer Fred Briggs . " It 's one step in what will be ongoing for many years . " <p> After all , the Internet was built in 1985 as a high-end network for science and now it 's becoming commonplace and transforming communication . The I-WAY project is about making history repeat . Says Argonne Labs ' Ian Foster : " We need to get people thinking bigger than they ever have before . "
