VN kith the recent flurry of proposals for universal health insurance , including a new plan submitted on June 5 by Majority Leader George Mitchell on behalf of leading Senate Democrats , a struggle that began three-quarters of a century ago in the United States has resurfaced . Four times ? in the Progressive Era , during the New Deal , under President Truman , and again in the 1970s ? reformers believed that passage of legislation was close at hand . Yet on each occasion the movement failed and the issue receded . Can we expect anything different this time ? Standing in the way of any action are formidable political obstacles : the lack of presidential leadership in health policy , the Democrats ' inability to set the national agenda , and the seemingly endless fiscal blockade of all domestic initiatives . Yet the underlying pressures for adoption of national health reform are stronger now than they have been for decades . One key factor improving the chances for comprehensive reform is the increasing jeopardy of the middle class . In retrospect , it is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second World War and the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s ( which provided coverage for the elderly and some of the poor ) created a virtually insuperable political problem for advocates of universal insurance . For while the remaining uninsured numbered in the millions , they had no organization or even any clear identity . Scattered across the society and composed disproportionately of children , the uninsured have been a population that can be measured but not easily mobilized . As a result , advocates of universal insurance , like advocates of so many other liberal policies since the 1960s , found themselves in recent decades appealing to middle-class voters to support change not for the voters ' own good but for the benefit of a minority and a hazily defined , politically inaudible minority at that . As health expenditures grew under both private insurance and government programs , the prospective cost of national health insurance seemed more and more forbidding . To the middle-class taxpayer ? even the family of the unionized worker , or the elderly protected by Medicare ? national health insurance seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many Americans more or less protected against the costs of illness , advocates of national health insurance could not easily answer an inevitable question : Why change the system for everyone if it was failing only a minority ? Recently , however , many people who once assumed that the system protected them have begun to feel threatened , as private insurance companies refine their methods of avoiding those with the highest health risks . Groups with older employees , particularly small businesses , and even whole industries and occupations , find today that they have been redlined as uninsurable . Millions of people , even those with insurance , discover they have no coverage for preexisting conditions , and others are reluctant to change jobs for fear of losing coverage . In response to rising health costs , employers have been modifying their insurance plans every which way : They have switched insurers , begun to self-insure , promoted health maintenance organizations and other plans limiting choice of doctor , required second opinions for surgery and other controls , imposed greater employee cost-sharing in premiums and higher co-payments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided some temporary relief , they have failed to produce any long-term solution . At best , firms have managed to shift costs to someone else ; at worst , they have simply abandoned providing health insurance altogether . The net result is that after years of efforts at cost containment , managers are frustrated and many employees are angry and fearful as they see their health benefits rolled back . This " desocialization " of health insurance increasingly exposes the middle class to the same insecurity as the uninsured poor . Few people under age sixty-five can be entirely confident today that they and their families will continue at all times to be protected by health insurance . They may be conservative and prudent and may even vote Republican ; still , if they develop a serious illness , lose their job , or change employer , they can not count on the private insurance system to protect them . In effect , the market-driven responses of employers and private insurers are undermining the traditional middle-class insulation from health costs that has made it so difficult to construct an alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class also has other objective causes for concern . One major reason why take-home pay has stagnated in real terms since the early 1970s is the increasing cost of health benefits as well as the share of taxes now taken by health programs . It is true that many who are still comfortably insured do not see how much health costs are hurting them , since the costs are partly hidden in employer contributions to health plans , tax subsidies , and complex public budgets . Yet hardly anyone , least of all the business and political leaders who confront total costs most directly , disagrees that the system is dangerously out of control . Today , the economic pain caused by the framework seemed hopeless . It no longer does . Years of tinkering with the framework , all to little avail , have broken down confidence that anything short of structural change will work . This growing recognition of the need for system-wide reforms fundamentally alters the politics of universal insurance . During the 1980s , with national health insurance off the agenda , many advocates of universal coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to extend it . They defined their objective as simply filling in the gaps in health insurance at the least political cost . Consequently , they came to support a variety of incremental steps , including requiring firms to provide insurance to their employees and broadening eligibility for Medicaid . Incremental reform aimed at minimizing opposition , but it did so with little regard for overall costs . That 's because this typically adds new people to the ranks of the insured and creates new benefits for some currently underinsured , while taking nothing away from the doctors , hospitals , and insurance industry . Such an approach raises total costs , often making the system even less efficient , but it has the political virtue of minimizing the tax burden of universal coverage . And since most public discussion of the issue confuses tax costs with total social costs , the supporters of incremental reform reasonably expect that most people will think the approach to be cheaper than national health insurance , which it ? almost certainly is not . Besides , by increasing the stream of revenue flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other providers , who are among the most enthusiastic supporters of such measures . These political considerations are shaping the current debate about health reform among Democrats . The Mitchell plan takes the path of incremental reform , with an additional step ( ot is it a bow ? ) in the direction of cost containment . By requiring employers to provide coverage or pay into a public program for the uninsured that would replace Medicaid , the plan both minimizes tax costs and places the burden of new taxes on a seemingly culpable party ( cheap and irresponsible employers ) . And by setting expenditure targets that are voluntary , this approach makes a gesture toward cost containment without actually enforcing limits and thereby antagonizing health care providers . The short-term political logic here is powerful . Frustrated in previous campaigns by the opposition of organized physicians , proponents of universal insurance now see an opportunity to win their support and to avoid arousing the resistance of the insurance and pharmaceutical industries . But precisely because of its accommodation of health care interests , the Mitchell plan does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place . The legislation just may be enacted , particularly if the Bush administration recognizes that by accepting some version of this approach it will deprive the opposition of its best campaign issue in the Nineties . Indeed , failure to control health costs or to change insurance-industry practices will almost certainly exacerbate current problems for the middle class , for business , and for the economy at large . Even the currently uninsured who gain coverage under this program will see its value erode unless there is real control of health costs . In the past , when confidence in the current framework of insurance was still strong , it may have made sense to accept the political necessity to build on it . But to build on it today , when its failures are manifest , is to underestimate the potential and need for change . he alternative of comprehensive reform , as I understand it , does not necessarily entail a governmental insurance plan . The key question is not who operates the insurance system but under what rules it operates . In the Euro-. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly lower than that which America pays for health care , the governments do not necessarily own the hospitals , employ the doctors , or run the insurance plans . But nearly all the governments set limits on health spending and establish rules that apply across their health care systems : setting ceilings on budgets for hospitals and doctors , limiting and regulating capital spending , regulating the rates that insurance companies charge , and insisting that insurance payments to providers constitute payment in full ? to prevent the providers from using the insurance system as a floor for ever higher charges . The keys to success are , first , " hard " budget constraints that force decision-makers ? from physicians to managers ? to develop styles of practice and plans of investment that make conservative use of the nation 's resources ; and , second , a framework for insurance that does not segregate the poor in a second-rate public plan or allow insurers to dump onto the public sector those whose medical history puts them at the greatest risk . While the public debate in America is warming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposing , debate remains constricted by a virtually unshakable conviction that any solution will be costly . Most Americans have firmly fixed in their minds the idea that national health insurance necessarily entails spending more money on medical care . That was certainly the case years ago , when a national health insurance program would have produced a sudden surge in health care spending . But now the United States has far higher health costs than do other Western countries ; we spend more than 12 percent of our gross national product on health care , compared with only 8-9 percent in Canada and Western Europe . Why higher costs here ? the one country without universal coverage ? Almost certainly because we did not enact national health insurance years ago . What Americans have feared as too costly has elsewhere evolved into a system for controlling costs . It could here too : The additional expense of covering the uninsured is now far outweighed by the potential for cost containment that an administratively streamlined national program could provide . Contrary to what many people assume , the lesson of Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be controlled only by rationing beneficial care . The chief savings are to be found in a reconstruction of health insurance along administratively simpler lines and in the constraints on health care provider income that a unified system affords . Of course , to secure these savings requires confronting entrenched financial interests . Ultimately , the real determinant of the cost of any health care reform is not the technical details of the proposal but the political support behind it . A political leadership capable of mobilizing the middle class and American business on the basis of their real interests could use national health insurance to achieve the results that other countries have seen : universal coverage at a moderate and stable percentage of national income . But while the nation 's leadership has begun to rethink its assumptions about health care , it has not yet broken loose from a skittish solicitude for established interests that fixes in place the current system of health care finance and precludes the fundamental reforms we need .                @ @ @ @ @
