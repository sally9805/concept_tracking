The last time I 'd seen my father he behaved like one of those wolf-boys , those kids suckled and eared in the wild by animals , and I was never sure , during the ten confusing minutes I stood on the lawn outside the house , whether or not he recognized me . The security chain on the back door remained slotted . Inside , through the crack , he asked me when I was going to relinquish my disease , which made me think either he was speaking rhetorically or confusing me with my brother Miles , who is schizophrenic and lives in a halfway . Then he seemed to have a moment of lucidity and called me a loser for dropping out of college . He had trouble breathing and rasped and swore like someone twitched by demons on a downtown corner . All the flowers , in the hanging baskets , in the clay pots , in the whiskey barrel , were dead and hissing dryly in the wind , so it was true , apparently , that he had watered the garden with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latinate with potty talk , calling my sisters complicitous cunts and my mother a vituperative bitch . His shouting had always had the effect of diminishing me , the sheer volume of it taking away the ground I stood on , for it would sound as if he were screaming across the country or into the past , to someone , at any rate , who was not present , and the longer I remained there , listening , the more invisible I felt . He had a certain emotional vigor that turned his head purple , and all during that most recent visit his head was purple . When I was a kid he 'd put that purple head in my face and grab my jaw and tell me , " If you were me you 'd be dead because my father would have killed you . " Driving away , I had that feeling , of echoes within echoes . <p> Certain he was finally and forever crazy , and in need of professional help , I called his shrink , Dr. Headberry , but that poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , about a werek later , my father tried to take his suffering public . He came to church dressed in his version of sackcloth and ashes  --  tin pants , snake boots , a wool coat with suede ovals at the elbows and a plaid cap with foam earflaps . These things had long ago been banished to hooks in the garage , and smelled , I knew , of motor oil and grass clippings and dusty , forgotten fabrics that have gone damp and dried , then gone damp again and dried again , endlessly over the years . He 'd locked away his guns after my brother Jackie ( as my father liked to say ) sucked a barrel  --  shoved a twelve-gauge Mossberg back in his tonsil-area and opened his skull against the bedroom wall . While both my older brothers were evidently fucked up , I , as the baby of the family , was luckily buffered by my four sisters . If it was n't for them , I knew I 'd be way more of a mental clodhopper than I was , o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Meg and especially Roxy , they all had this special way , this oddball interest in good places to paddle canoes , and herb remedies , and parks where you could take safe walks in the dark , and sardonyx and black fire opals , and weird healing practices , and crow feathers and chips of eggshells , and numerology , and playing records backwards , and food that did n't come out of a can or box . My father thought they were witches . Roxy carried a bull thistle in a tea infuser chained around her neck . The Salish believed thistles would ward off back luck , and the Scots believed they would keep away the enemy . Roxy gave me a thistle of my own and once she gave me a pomegranate . I 'd never seen one before , and I was shocked that someone could think of me , sitting downstairs in Jackie 's room , on Jackie 's old bed , and bring me a gift out of nowhere , and for no reason . A pomegranate . Out of nowhere , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , and it was . <p> I watched my father from across the aisle . He knelt in a pew with his head bowed , and his hands hung limply over the backrest as though he 'd been clamped into a pillory . Lawyers for both sides had called me , asking if I 'd testify if the divorce went to trial , but I had no idea what I 'd say if I were being deposed . He looked drunk and sleepy and wired , and also penitent in this odd , remembered way , as if he were still trying to fool some buzzard-backed nun from his childhood . He wiped sweat from his brow with a wrinkled hanky , mopped the back of his neck , held the thing like a flag of truce as he folded his hands for prayer . During the offertory he began crying or wereping  --  wereping , I guess , because there was something stagey about it . He beat the butt of his palm against his head , lifted his eyes to the cross , and said , " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wish I could be crucified , " my father had told me over the phone , the day after he was served papers . " That 's really the only way to settle these things . " <p> Despite the lunacy of pitting his agony against the agony of Jesus Christ , I now decided he was n't crazy . This was calculated . He 'd come to menace and harass my mother . For years church had been her only bastion and retreat and he 'd come as a trespasser to violate it , to pollute its purity and calm , to take it away from her , and make it ugly like everything else in our life , and that 's what I 'd tell the lawyers . I was no disciple or defender of the church and no big fan of the snobs who werekly attended mass . With its pale green walls and polished pine benches and high windows of distorted glass it seemed a place for lame rummage sales , a place where fussy old men sold boxes of yesterday 's best-sellers , soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the old seemed ancient  --  widowers in pleated pants who had retired into a sallow golden age , bereft men with nothing to do but sip their pensions like weak tea in a waiting room whose only door opened on death . And the women  --  some so fanatically dedicated to a pre-Vatican II universe they still wore hats within the nave , and if they 'd forgotten a scarf or hat , they 'd unclasp their purses and find a Kleenex and bobby-pin that to their hair . Arranged in the pews these women with toilet paper on their heads looked like planted rows of petunias . Yet that Saturday , as my father crudely interrupted the service , I considered the possibility that the heart and soul of any faith is absurdity , and that these ridiculous , otherworldly women , with their silly gestures , might just be saints . The mass stopped and everyone turned from the altar and stared at him . Everyone  --  the Greys , the Hams , the Wooleys , Mrs. Kayhew and the Grands and the Stones . Also the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with whisperings of disbelief and doubt , and only my mother , who was the eucharistic minister and sat in the sanctuary , remained quiet and calm . She laced her hands together and set them like a dead bird in her lap . Sitting in her chair , icily withdrawn , she looked as she did when I was a child and dinner was not going well , evenings when my father occupied the head of the table like a cigar-store Indian and silence settled in our bones and we could hear little else but the tink-tink of fork tines and the sound of chewing and it was painful to swallow . Those nights I would n't eat the hard things , the raw carrots or breadsticks , for fear of making a noise , and my mother would n't eat at all . My mother liked to say that silence had made her a very slender woman , and it was true , she was slim and at sixty still looked girlish in blue jeans . <p> The priest drank wine from the chalice and , wiping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He leaned toward her , whispered something in her ear , and she nodded her head deliberately . Together they stepped down to the communion rail . My father waited until the line dwindled down , then lifted himself awkwardly , stumbling up the aisle alone . I saw Mrs. Grand lay a hand on her husband , restraining him . My father stood , swaying a little , before my mother . Later , after my mother returned from her trip to Texas , she would tell me it was not her place to judge , and certainly not the role as the morning 's eucharistic minister . Her faith gave he the ability not to judge anything , even movies . To me , as an outsider , and someone without any faith at all , the scene at the communion rail seemed a show of profound strength , but my father , later , would say he only went up there to prove what a chickenshit she was . The church was dead quiet . My mother lifted the eucharist as you would a bright , promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father looked up . " Body and Blood of Christ , " she said , and he responded , " Amen , " and then she very carefully set the host on his waiting tongue . <p> After the blessing my mother left the sanctuary and knelt in the front pew . The door in the vestibule had been jammed open with a rubber wedge and a cool wet wind circulated through church , stirring the lace edge of the altar cloth and the sprigs of white gladiolas in their fluted gold standards . He friends filed out , and cars left the lot . She remained kneeling on the padded hassock and prayed with her eyes shut and with her eyes shut she heard , from the vestibule , the ruffle of the priest 's soutane as the black skirt swept the floor , and then the hurried , heavy steps of my father . She remained still and continued to pray . <p> " She denied me and she denied me , " my father said to the priest . " She denied me even the simplest things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the confessionals  --  the penalty boxes , my father called them , those two upright coffins in the corner of the church . Probably it crossed the priest 's mind that the formality of this arrangement might help contain my father 's apparent madness . A closed door , at the very least , might muffle his complaint . My father did n't often go out in public because he thought people did n't like him , and when he did socialize , out of nervousness and excessive drinking , he was a terrible gas bag , and most people did try to avoid him , and so the fact that he 'd come to church , and made such an awful ruckus , now swayed me back in the direction of the idea that he must be crazy . I was about to step in , but the priest waved me away . <p> " Even bedtime pleasures . " <p> The priest said , " I 'm sure there 's more to the story . " <p> " Do n't tell me about stories , " my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins . " <p> " No it is n't , " the priest said , firmly . <p> My father ignored him , shouting at my mother . <p> " How dare you judge me ? You call yourself Christians ? " <p> The altar boy returned to snuff the candles and collect the cruets of wine and water . My mother could smell the curls of black smoke rising from the burnt wicks . With her eyes closed , she felt as though she could lift herself up , she could rise away and soar , as she said her prayers , on the whispered fluttering wingbeat of words , away , away , away ... while my father stared after her from what then seemed a lifetime of hatred . She did not move . He skin was pale to the point of appearing blue . Her fingers , interlaced , were delicate and weak . She was as still in her pew as the pale crucified Christ floating high above the sanctuary , but she was gone . <p> " Goddamn you to hell , " my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't dropped out of school . In early March the bursar asked me to withdraw until the outstanding balance on my tuition bill was paid . I stuffed a rucksack with clothes and left campus that night . I was relieved . My lisp made me quiet and shy , embarrassed at the sound of myself , and also something of a hostile shit . People gathered in their dorms , smoked bong hits under batik bedspreads that breathed and endlessly analyzed their families . I could n't get into it . The soft sibilance of my voice did n't square with what I had to say , and I felt paralyzed by a pressure , a sense that if I started talking there was a good chance I 'd never stop . To cue this , or get around it , I had signed up for a writing course , but dropped it when I could n't figure out the economy of a story , the lifeboat ethics of it  --  who got pitched in with the sharks , who got rescued . By the end of January I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written assignments , and sometime in February I pulled the curtains and lay in bed for a werek . <p> I left school without telling anyone , in part because as a rule , a policy , I never say good-bye . The night I walked off campus was quiet , I remember , that country quiet where every sound seems to have a distinct place in the world , and by the next morning I 'd hitched to Altoona , Wisconsin . From there I hopped a freight train home to Seattle . Twice , as the train crossed trestles over the Yellowstone and then later over the Clark Fork , I considered jumping off to do some fishing , but the divorce was already in progress and I was convinced my father was going to destroy the contents of our house . ( He did : he burned the christening dress we 'd been baptized in , he tossed our photo albums . ) Back in Seattle I rented a shoe box room and got a job busing tables at a restaurant owned by two lesbians I knew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I spent most nights hunched over my vice , drinking beer and tying flies , filling one box with hate 's ears and pheasant tails , and another with size 16 blue-winged olives and pale morning duns . My only plan in the world right then was to hop a train to Livingston , head into the park and fish the Firehole near the west end of Fountain Flats , a place that was a favorite of both Miles and Jackie . After that , after Memorial Day , I planned to take my tent and stove and live in the park all season . ( Which I did , until in mid-October I woke one morning with my tent sagging like a collapsed parachute and was driven out by snow . ) <p> The only things I wanted out of our house were Miles 's old fly rod and the original fifteen and a half pages of Jackie 's suicide note . <p> Realtor 's signs had been staked into the front and side yards , and a sandwich board stood spraddled on the sidewalk . OPEN HOUSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name was Cynthia . My father 's beat spy car was parked in the drive , the passenger door lashed shut with loops of clothesline , the landau top half-scalped , peeling back to raw metal . For wereks he 'd been tailing my mother around town in this battered , rust-bitten Plymouth . Was this corny or dangerous ? In the last days , as the end drew near , he 'd thrown her down the stairs , grated her arm with a grapefruit knife  --  but the end had been drawing near regularly for twenty years ; my entire life , and the tragic end of it all was the very rhythm of all our hearts , and if two of my sisters , Roxy and Karen , had n't finally abducted my mother , had n't dragged her out of the house , she would have stayed , I bet , and would still be getting chased around the house with knives and screamed at . <p> As the youngest of seven children , my family 's history had always been my future , a past I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place where the choices had been made , irrevocably . As a result I was never very interested in the riddle of heredity or the way dysteleology can become design . I arrived too late to believe any other world existed . I was fourteen when Miles started living either on Western Avenue behind the Skyway coat factory or at the V.A . or in a series of ratty halfway houses , and by now I just assumed the voices Miles heard would speak to me also . I was sixteen when Jackie killed himself . At twenty , I assumed madness would visit me , and so would suicide . I assumed they would approach quietly and hold out their hands and claim me and take me where they had taken my brothers . Miles had tried to kill himself too , driven by his voices to jump off the Aurora Bridge , but he 'd survived . Frequently , obsessively , I fantasized sitting on the bridge railing and shooting myself in the head . That way in one moment I 'd bring my brothers together in me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . And my father ? Would I know him ? Could I even describe him ? Often my father could n't take a shit unless my mother held his hand . But I could n't really imagine that . <p> I looked up , and there he was , framed in the open window of Miles 's old bedroom . <p> " You ca n't come in , " he shouted . " My lawyer guy said nobody can come in the house . Not you , not anybody . I 'm sorry , I know it sounds stupid , but too many negative things redound in my direction . " <p> " I came to get my stuff , " I said . <p> " I have to insulate me totally . " <p> He disappeared from the window and reappeared at the back door . He opened it a crack , steel chain still slotted . <p> " We did this last werek , " I said . <p> " You ca n't come in . I 'm sorry , too many negative things . You 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't my idea . I wanted to work it out . There 's family solutions to family problems , but this , this is appalling and obscene , it 's immoral . " <p> " I have a key , " I said . <p> " Not any more you do n't . I changed the locks . " <p> The back porch was lined with clay pots full of dead marigolds , woolly brown swabs on bent black stalks . <p> " What 's wrong ? " I asked . <p> " Wrong ? Nothing 's wrong except your mother 's got me by the fucking balls . She 's got her hooks in me , but I 'm fine . " <p> I picked up one of the clay pots and put my nose to the soil and it had the cold smell of gasoline . <p> " Did you pour gas on the flowers ? " <p> " That 's just more of your mother 's calumny . " <p> " I think we should call Dr. Headberry , " I said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no real problems . He 's got your mother analyzed perfectly , though . It 's ugly . She 's got control of my life . " <p> He was lying about Headberry , of course , and unless something happened we were going to continue having the kind of conversation that you have when there 's only one seat left on the bus . <p> " Let me in . " <p> " I do n't understand the ugliness  --  the enormity of the entire process . So many hooks there  --  they 've got control of my life . " <p> I dropped the pot , letting it shatter on the porch , and started walking back out to my truck . <p> " This is against my better instinct , " my father said . He closed the door and slipped the chain off . " It 's against everything I know and against my lawyer 's advice too . " <p> " Thanks , " I said . I nodded out toward the Realtor 's sign . " There 's an open house tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , I guess you 're here and you 're coming in and we 'll talk and maybe have a drink and then you 'll leave . So let 's start . Come on in . " <p> Except for boxers drooping off his ass , he was naked . His hunting outfit was piled on a shelf in the kitchen . <p> He shook his head , and scratched the thick , knotted hair on his chest , then rubbed his arms , his stubbled face . <p> " Feel like my veins are turning into worms , " he said . <p> " Why 'd you come to church ? " <p> " Hey , do n't forget I let you in , " he said . He fumbled inside his coat and pulled out a piece of paper . " I got the restraining order right here . I take it with me everywhere I go . I felt the need to talk to a priest . " He scratched the pale insides of his arm , and examined the legal document . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Once you get inside you get asylum . " <p> He returned the paper to his coat pocket and then picked up the kitchen garbage can , reached his hand in , and pushed aside newspaper , a tuna can , a melon rind . <p> " See ? " he said . <p> He meant to show me a prescription bottle at the bottom of the can . I lifted it out , gave it a rattle , and held it to the light . <p> " There 's one left , " I said . <p> " I quit , " he said . " Thirty-five years and now I 've kicked ' em cold turkey . " <p> My father never talked about his own father , and the oldest story he ever told me about himself was of the way snow whipped off Lake Erie in August of 1953 , great blinding gusts and rolling drifts , the summer landscape sculpted into a sea of white . Fantastic ! A miracle ! Naturally , of course , it had n't been August . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanatorium and then shocked out of his mind for six months , and it was January , the day of his release . Why , in telling me this , had he left the story in its state of confusion ? Now I thought of the snow in August . At the time , electro-convulsive therapy was an experimental procedure and current thinking called for barbituates in long-term intractable cases . That , then , was science and the bold sci-fi future . My father , the day of his release , filled his prescription at a corner druggist and renewed it regularly , like his subscription to the Wall Street Journal , for the next thirty-five years . <p> " When d' you quit ? " <p> " It 's a booger , man , " he said , clawing at his arms and again at the matted hair on his chest . " I tried watching TV . Then I tried taking a shower and banging my head against the wall . " <p> " You just now tossed these , " I said . <p> " Why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked ? " he shouted . " My clothes were driving me crazy , that 's why . " <p> " I 'd like to call Headberry . " <p> He scratched himself some more . " Worms , man . I feel like I could explode . You want a drink ? " <p> The gin and limes and a tray of melting ice were already out on the sink counter . He fixed us two drinks and we sat at the dining table . Across the street the Grand and Wooley families walked out onto their adjoining lawns . A badminton net was strung across the property line on metal stakes . The kids , some of them my age , stood on one side , and the parents stood on the other . Everybody carried rackets and Mr. Wooley , in chinos and a pink shirt , opened a cannister of birdies . Bill Grand said something and Bill Wooley leaned back and aimed a silent laugh at the sky . <p> " I hate those redundant bastards , " my father commented . <p> " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , you know one you know ' em all . " He sipped his drink with fine relish . " Where 's your mother going ? " <p> It surprised me that he knew she was going anywhere , and I was caught off guard . <p> " I 'm not saying , " I said , and now there was a secret betweren us . <p> " She 's having an affair . " <p> " Mom ? Mom 's not having an affair . " <p> " What makes you so sure ? " <p> " Who with then ? " <p> My father looked away , out the window . " Jesus Christ , probably . " He sucked an ice cube out of his drink and bit it , spitting glassy splinters . " She 's got me by the nuts . " <p> " Hardly , " I said . " You 're free . " <p> " Free ? Free my ass . You know , I 've never been to the rainforest  --  is n't that a phenomena ? She 's mortgaged my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought this was an old bromide all fathers told their kids . Do n't mortgage my work effort . No one in this house is going to mortgage my work effort . Roxy took me to the dictionary and explained . Mort , she said , means dead . And gage , she said , means security . <p> " That does n't make any sense , " I told him now . <p> " No ? Okay , fine . What 's up with you ? " <p> I guessed we were going to ignore the scene at church . Somehow we had agreed to forget it . <p> " I had a dream about you last night . " <p> " Other people 's dreams are boring . " <p> " I was over here , in the kitchen . You were trying to give me some medicine , like when I was a kid , with a squeeze dropper . Like liquid aspirin . But I was n't a kid anymore . You were holding the back of my head and telling me to open my mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you put a gun in my mouth and kept saying , take your medicine . Take your medicine , you 'll feel better . " <p> " Goddamnit , " he said . <p> " It 's just a dream . " <p> " Let 's talk about something else . You hear the latest about Mr. Kayhew ? " <p> " No , what ? " <p> " You knew a blood vessel popped in his head ? Up in an airplane , up there behind the curtain , first class , knowing the Kayhews . He was n't dead , just in a coma . I heard they rented him his own apartment and he lived there in a coma . " <p> " I did n't know . " <p> " I 'm practically there myself . " <p> I must have made a face . <p> " What ? I 'm serious . When I die I 'll be exploded to shit . People 'll look in the box and say , ' Good God , what the hell killed him ? " <p> My dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the lip of his glass . <p> " Just everything , " he said , answering himself . " Anyway , Kayhew 's out . " <p> " Out ? " <p> " He was in a coma . " <p> " You told me that , " I said . " So he 's out of it now ? " <p> " I guess . I guess you could say that . He 's dead . " <p> " That 's not what people usually mean when they say someone comes out of a coma . " <p> " Well , it 's a little discussed medical fact , but dying is the other way out . " <p> After a moment , he said , " We were friends , you know , me and Kayhew . Not great friends , but I liked him all right , and he liked me . I think he liked me . He never actually said he liked me , but  --  anyway , the point is , I read his obit  --  he was much beloved , survived by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's five years older than me . You know how many days that is ? " <p> " Do you ? " I said . <p> " 2,190 , " my father said . " Given my habits , I figure I 've got 2,000 days left . " He raised his eyebrows . " This is one of them . " He shrugged . " How 's your drink ? You want another ? I 'm having another . " <p> " I 'll hold off , " I said . <p> But he made me a drink anyway . When he returned to the table , a cigarette dangled from his lips . <p> " Smoking ? " <p> " 2,000 days , man . Who gives a crap ? " <p> I left the split seeds and floating pulp of my old drink and started the new one . I held the glass to the light and the fresh gin at that moment seemed to be the clearest thing I 'd ever seen in my life . <p> " Miles used to say certain streams were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he 'd describe them . " <p> " I hate fishing . " <p> " I was only remembering . It was just something to say . " <p> " I 've worked in insurance all my life , " he said . " The actuarial tables are incredibly accurate . They 'll nail you to the wall just about every time . You can read those things and then call a mortician and make an appointment . Like Jackie . " <p> Jackie 's last day , his last hour , was an obsessive concern of mine . I 'd reconstructed it . I knew where he went , who he talked to , the last tape he played in his stereo ( " Johnny Was , " by Stiff Little Fingers ) . The night Jackie shot himself my mother had come into his bedroom . He was at his desk , writing . It was shortly after 8:30 . He wore a green and gray flannel shirt , blue jeans with blown out knees , black army boots . Jackie would n't turn around and face her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strange , that Jackie had a shotgun in his room . " I 'm watching a TV show , " he said , " do n't interrupt me . And close the door when you leave . " But that does n't really explain . What he told my mother that night he told her every night . Without the punctuation of Jackie 's death the night of November 26 , and all the information I 'd gathered about it , would mean nothing . But at 4:30 in the morning , when the police lights pulsed in the graying air and a couple cops stood on the lawn discussing the case , I ran out there in my pj's. " it was n't suicide , " I screamed at them . " It was murder ! " <p> " You want a smoke ? " My dad waved his pack of Pall Malls at me . He went to the kitchen and fished in the garbage can and set the tuna can between us . " No ashtrays . I quit these buggers to save money . I calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year on cigs . That was when I only made two hundred a month . A whole month 's salary . So I quit . " <p> " Where 's the rug ? " I asked . <p> I had just felt with my feet below the dining table that the oriental rug was n't there . <p> " What ? The rug , I do n't know . " <p> " That 's weird , " I said . " All my life it was under the table and now it 's gone . " <p> " Crazy , huh ? " <p> I finished my drink , stood and said , " I 'm gon na split . First I want to get some stuff . " <p> " Stay here , " my dad said . " I ca n't having you running around the house . " <p> " It 's my house too . " <p> " On what piece of paper does it say this is your house ? " <p> " There 's only two things I want . " <p> " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have another drink . " <p> " I want Miles 's fly rod . You do n't fish and I want it . " <p> " It 's yours , you can have it . Okay ? Jesus . I hate fishing . Fishing makes me feel fucking hopeless . " <p> " And the christening dress , I want that too . " <p> " I 'm not sure where that is , " my dad said . <p> " Crazy , huh ? " <p> " It 's fucking nuts , " he said , " the way things get lost . " <p> Out the window the Grands and Wooleys were still playing badminton in the lowering light . I could faintly hear their shouts and cries as they chased the birdie . The gray air seemed to be filling the house like rising water . <p> My dad said , " It 's wild . " <p> I waited for him to say what was wild , but he only looked out the window . <p> " What ?

" <p> " She went to the travel agent . She used our credit card to charge the ticket . That 's how . " <p> " You put on quite a show at church this afternoon . " <p> " A show ? " <p> I was starting to feel hazy , blurred . " Yeah , a show . You almost looked like somebody in need of pity . " <p> I shook a Pall Mall from the pack , lit it . My dad watched the badminton game wind down . The Wooleys and the Grands seemed to be running around their lawn swatting flies . Cheers went up , moans , cries , but I could no longer see what they were chasing . It was too dark . A clock ticked in the living room and the refrigerator buzzed and a wind must have risen because behind me a branch scratched the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , " I said . <p> " You know what the agent told me ? Cynthia- that 's her name , Cynthia  --  she told me the place had bad vibes . " <p> " I do n't get it . " <p> " We 'll have to sell below the appraised value , " my dad said . " We wo n't get near the asking price . They all know Jackie killed himself in the basement , they know Miles is crazy , they know all that shit . " <p> " They ? Who 's they ? " <p> " People . " He looked at me . He smiled , grimly . " Do what you have to do . I 'm having another drink . This gin is something , huh ? " <p> Our basement was a museum housing a collection of all the usual artifacts . In bins and racks , we had baseball bats , broken skis , tennis rackets with warped guts , wingless gliders , golf clubs , aquariums , hula hoops , a bowling ball and several orange lifejackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an old O'Brien waterski and a gas can , all with the idea , a very sudden , impulsive idea , that he 'd buy a boat , too . For weeks after we saw boats gleaming in showrooms or parked on trailers in someone 's driveway or heading out to sea or docked at a slip in the Union Bay Marina . I do n't know what happened to that idea , but here were four faded lifejackets , hooked on tenpenny nails . Along a rickety wooden shelf were cases of canned peas and corn and thirty-weight oil , a box of powdered milk , several bottles of novitiate wine  --  bulk items of a big family . In boxes were tools , tools to fix everything , from loose chair legs to leaky faucets . C-clamps , crimpers , a circular saw . With a tool in his hand , my dad was no better than a caveman . He could n't fix anything . He usually ended up clubbing whatever would n't work , breaking it worse . But he loved tools , he strolled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enthusiasm other people might reserve for the Louvre . <p> I found what I was looking for : a polished cherry wood case , narrow and about two and a half feet long . I brought it upstairs and turned on a light . I popped the hasp , and opened the box . The inside was lined with crushed velvet , and hand-carved bridges at either end held the rod in place . I lifted the butt end out , cradled the sanded cork in my hand . The cane was pale blond , unmarred by knots or coarse grain , and the lacquer , gin clear , seemed only to draw out the bamboo 's simplicity ; the reel seat was rosewood , the fittings nickel plated ; the guides gleamed ; the ferrules were wrapped in blue and green thread , winding in a spiral pattern . I heard the ice in my dad 's glass clink , and then he was there , looking at the rod over my shoulder . I turned the rod in my hand . Miles had called us all down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He used a Chinese brush from which he 'd clipped all but a single horsehair . I remember watching him do it , the way he held one hand steady with the other while , miraculously , his name looped across the cane in a single stoke . <p> " That 's art , man . That 's a piece of work , " I said . <p> " Not bad for a crazy fuck , " my dad said . <p> " He was n't crazy then . " I angled the rod in the light . " It 's just the opposite of how he is now . It 's simple . " <p> " Have another drink ? " <p> " No thanks , " I said . <p> From the kitchen , Dad said , " You planning a trip ? " <p> " Wyoming , " I said . " I 'm gon na live in the park all season . " <p> " That 's stupid , " Dad said . " Here 's your gin . " <p> " I said no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . " <p> " What about school ? " <p> " What about it ? " <p> " Do n't look at me that way , " my father said . " I 'm broke . " <p> " Anyway , it 's where I tossed Jackie 's ashes , " I said . After he 'd been cremated , we were each given an envelope of ashes , just a pinch  --  you 'd throw more oregano in a pot of spaghetti sauce . <p> " Where ? " <p> " Well , you 've never been there , so it 's hard to describe . " <p> " Hey guy , " my father said , " it 's good to see you . " <p> " You 're drunk . " <p> " Sure . Been drunk . I do n't think I 've talked to anyone for ten days , two weeks . " <p> " You 're talking pretty good tonight . " <p> " I guess I am . Imagine if you were God and had to listen to all this . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone back to the shoe box , and there were four or five opportunities to say I 'd had enough , I got what I wanted , see you . But the evening kept opening up , wider and wider , accepting every vague word and half-assed idea . Everything was finding a place ; there was a room at every inn . The night became like a fairy tale in which every juncture is answered with a yes , and the children hold hands and merrily mach down the dark trail into a furnace . The gin fan clear , the tuna can was full of stubbed Pall Malls , I was drunk and awake and my dad was drunk and awake , and the space was there , yawning , and something had to happen . <p> " Tell me where your mother is ? " Dad was saying . <p> " No way , " I insisted . <p> " Tell me . " <p> " Okay , " I said . I squinted a teasing look across the table . <p> " I 'll trade you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I want the original of Jackie 's letter . " <p> " Ca n't do it . I do n't know where it is . " <p> " Oh well  --  " <p> " Get it , " I said . <p> " You do n't trust me ? " <p> " Oh , I do n't think so . " <p> When he brought the letter back I checked to make sure all fifteen and a half pages were there , licking my fingers and counting them like bills . <p> Then I said , " She 's gone to see an angel . " <p> " An angel huh ? " <p> " In the bark of a tree , a cottonwood . In the middle of a junkyard somewhere in Texas . There 's been reports , so she 's going to see for herself . " <p> " It 's been in the papers . I 've read about that angel . " He lit a cigarette , waved the smoke from his face . " Hey , we got coffee stains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house . " <p> A bus passed out front . An old habit , I looked through the window to see if any of my brothers or sisters were coming home . <p> " Your mother was never anything but a whore . She got me fired off my job . All slander . " <p> " The reason you were fired is because no one likes you . You 're an asshole  --  that 's actually a quote . " <p> " Who said that ? Markula ? " <p> " I 'm not telling . " <p> " I got something else to give you , " my father said . <p> He disappeared again and when he returned to the table he set the shotgun and a box of shells in front of me . <p> I said , " That 's the gun . " <p> " Cops took this as evidence , " my father said . " Suicide 's a crime . Evidence ? Heigh-ho  --  but I got it back . " <p> In the garage we gathered up gunnysacks , some twine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Me and Miles used to do this , " my dad said , as we drove away . <p> Again I thought he was confusing me with my brother . <p> " I 'm not too big on guns , " I reminded him . <p> " Neither was Jackie . You took after him on that . " <p> I thought there was a joke in there somehow , but I could n't find it . <p> " A gun does n't mean anything . " <p> " Huh ? " <p> " Take a caveman , " my father said . " You put a short-arm of some sort , a .38 or what have you , you put it on the ground with some other stuff , like a rock and a sewing machine and a banana . Ordinary things . What 's the caveman going to do ? Huh ? He 's not going to look at the banana and think , Oh , this 'd be good on cornflakes . He 's not going to take the sewing machine and stitch up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun and think , Maybe I ' 11 blow my head off . You see what I 'm saying . " <p> I thought I did , and then I was sure I did n't . <p> " I 'm nearly broke , " my dad said . <p> " No you 're not . " <p> " I thought I 'd be living with more dignity by this time , but it 's not turning out that way . " <p> " You 're lying , " I said again . It was n't an accusation , more like a statement . We were stopped at a four-way intersection . My father curled his hands tightly around the wheel to steady them . <p> " Maybe I should do the Jackie thing , " he said . <p> " Fuck you , " I said . The words just popped out of my mouth , like a champagne cork . Now my hands were trembling , and I put them in my coat pocket . " Do n't ever say that again . " <p> " Why are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's just go . Let 's get those birds . " <p> I 've read and reread Jackie 's letter to us , I 've searched the final paragraph for a summation . Now I had the original . The letter is long . In it he lists the things he likes : wolves and trains , the Skagit River , coasting a bike down Market Street in Ballard . He talks about my mom , Dad , my four sisters and Miles , but at no time does he mention me . Toward the last few pages I sense a creepy mortmain , as if my father 's hand is folded over his , guiding the pen across the page , line by line , word by word . Is he trying to say something about himself , or about my father ? I look at the last word and think of the moment when he put down the pen and picked up the gun and pulled the trigger . How much time passed ? Had he been thinking it over ? To pull the trigger he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the paper . What went on in that space ? Between the pen and the gun ? <p> Under the freeway we found a cement ledge . A sleepy cooing came from the recess , the occasional flutter of beating wings . It sounded like a nursery at nap time . <p> " You stay down here , " Dad said . " I 'll hand the birds to you . " <p> He chinned himself onto the ledge , grunting loudly . He wiped shit o his hands , and I passed him the flashlight . He aimed the beam at the birds , a row of them squatting along the ledge . The first bird was mottled gray and brown with beady eyes like drops of melted chocolate . Its eyes remained wide open , stunned and tranced , staring into the beam , unable to move or turn away from the white light . Dad stroked the bird 's throat gently . " Come to papa , " he said , and when he 'd soothed it somewhat he grabbed it by the neck and passed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my hand . I slipped the bird into the gunnysack . The pigeon flopped around , trying to orient itself . Dad jacklit another and another . Some were white , others black as crows . After we 'd bagged five birds I tied off the first sack with twine and started a new one . Dad handed me five more paralyzed pigeons and then jumped down . <p> " That ought to do it , " he said . He brushed molted gray feathers from his face , from his arms . " Look at that , " he said . <p> The sacks were alive with confused pigeons , two blobs rolling down the hill . You could see the birds struggling to take off , stupidly beating against the burlap . We tan after them , two drunks at a pigeon rodeo , each grabbing a sack . <p> We put the birds in the back seat of the car . I picked a downy feather from my father 's ear . <p> " You still pissed ? " he said . <p> " Do n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow ? " <p> " I 've heard it before . " <p> " Feel like it was just yesterday I was driving around the woods with the Beauty Queen , trying to get my hand up her skirt . " <p> My father laughed . The Beauty Queen was my mother . She 'd been Miss Spanaway in 1954 . <p> " Well , " he said , gesturing broadly with a sweep of the bottle , " I did . Seven kids . One dead , one crazy . Four girls who do n't want a damn thing to do with me . Then you . What the fuck 's wrong with you , I wonder ? " <p> " We going ? " <p> The pigeons were insane , jumping around inside the sacks . A crazy burlap aviary . My father got out of the car , took the sacks , and spun the birds in circles . When he put them back in the seat , they were quiet . <p> " You 're the only one left . You 'll bury me , " my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Generally my father was what people call a paper killer . He drove to a firing range and clamped on ear protection and stood in a port lined with blue baffle shield and shot two-bit targets . Bull's-eyes , black silhouettes , now and then the joke target of a dictator 's face in profile . At the end of an afternoon of shooting , he 'd roll up and rubber band his targets , tacking the best to a wall in his den , like trophies . " You shoot against your old self , " he 'd told me . Of the boys , it was my crazy brother Miles who enjoyed guns . Jackie hated them . The first and only time he 'd ever fired a gun , the barrel was in his mouth . Obviously , you do n't need to be a sharpshooter to kill yourself . Even before Jackie , I 'd never liked guns . My father sensed this hesitance , and took me out to the woods , trying to teach me to see things and then trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , robins . The only time I 'd actually fired a gun with him was at a gravel pit . He stood behind me and watched as I leveled his bolt-action .22 at a row of pop cans . He calmly gave me directions , but I quickly aimed high and pinched off a round , missing , then chambering another round and missing again , spent shells skittering at my feet in brassy flashes , until I dry-fired and knew the gun was empty . I was ten years old , and it was the first time I 'd ever felt like I was not in control of myself . I 'd been feeling the urge to turn around and shoot my father . <p> It was near dawn when we parked at the gravel pit . I had n't been there in ten years and it was now abandoned , a maze of packed dirt roads , each ending in a cul-de-sac of bitten earth . I carried the pigeons and Dad carried the gun . The sky was just beginning to pale with a metallic dawn light outlining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Ca n't drink like I used to , " Dad said . <p> I raised an eyebrow . " How 'd you used to ? " <p> " I did n't mean I do n't drink like I used to , " he said . " Just I ca n't . " He coughed up a laugh , breathing in short , swift asps . He lit a cigarette . " My lawyer call you ? " <p> " He did . " <p> " You gon na testify ? " <p> I though about it , briefly , as shapes in the gravel pit took on solidity . People were using it as a dump . Washing machines , the odd chair , boxes and lawnbags , bent and twisted gutters , a suitcase . <p> " I would n't let it go to trial , " I said . <p> " You mean I do n't have a chance ? " <p> I imagined my father 's life caught up in the snare of the law , the courts , in the web of family history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I knew he would not fare well . <p> " I 'd settle . " <p> My father nodded . He pointed the shotgun at the gunnysack of pigeons . <p> " Better than skeet , " he said . <p> " I 'll release them . " <p> " You do n't want to shoot ? You want , you can go first . " <p> I looked at the gun , resting across my father 's lap . I knew no magic inhered in the piece itself , that it was just a shotgun , but even though I could convince myself that the thing housed no resident bogey , I would n't touch it . <p> " I 'll just do the birds , " I said . <p> I carried both sacks about fifty yards away , intensely aware that my back was turned to my father . A spot at the base of my neck grew hot . My heart beat in a way that made me conscious of it . I untied the knot on the first sack and gently cradled a pigeon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father . He nodded . I spun the bird in circles , round and round , and then I set it down . It fell over . The next few moments were kind of vaudevillian . The pigeon flapped its wings , raising a cloud of dust , scooting sideways over the ground , pratfalling , and then it took ( light , rising drunkenly in the air , executing a few goofy loops and turns . By instinct the pigeon appeared to know it was supposed to fly , but could n't figure out the up and down of it . It smashed to the ground , leaden , then rose again . Before it could gain equilibrium and fly level , I heard the deep percussive blast of the shotgun , and the pigeon jerked back , propelled by the impact , and fell like a limp dishrag from the sky . Immediately I grabbed another bird . Its heart raced in my palm . Dad nodded . I spun it around and released it , watching as it rose so far and then exploded in a flakburst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I held the bird , I could feel its life , the heart and the breast bones and the soft cooing in its throat , but there really was no moment of decision on my part , no hesitation , as I released the bird . I tossed another into the air , watching it struggle wildly against falling , then rise erratically , lifting above the trees , and get blown out of the sky . <p> " Take a shot , " my Dad said . <p> " No thanks , " I said . <p> He came to me , and we sat down again . He drank from the gin and passed the bottle . <p> " This used to be open country out here , " he said . " But I think we 're inside the city limits now . I think we 're in the suburbs . " <p> I took a drink , and said , " You know the christening dress ? All of us were baptized in that . Mom was , and grandpa too . " <p> " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " She 'll get an annullment . Everything to nothing in the eyes  --  " I interrupted . <p> " But we 'll never see it again , right ? " <p> When he did n't answer , I said , " Let 's head out . " <p> " There 's one more pigeon left . " <p> I folded open the sack and let the bird go . It walked around , head bobbing , among the dead ones . <p> My father , on thorazine , always became childlike . He walked in slanted , headlong , stumbling bursts that ended when he smacked into walls or collapsed in a heap on the carpet . He hid in closets , he broke his head open falling down stairs . We cleaned up after him , we mopped piss off the bathroom floor , we helped my mother wipe his muddied ass . At dinner , we wrapped a bedsheet around his neck and spoonfed him pureed carrots and canned spaghetti and pale green peas we mooshed with a fork . We fought over the chance to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He babbled and sputtered and sometimes through the thorazine fog the rudiments of language bubbled up . Once , while the nine of us sat at the table , silently eating our dinner , he began to mumble , and we all leaned forward to listen . " Fuck you , " he said . " Fuck you . Fuck you . Fuck you . " My mother pushed another spoonful of mashed potato in his mouth , and it burbled back out in a fuck you . <p> As the youngest I was never left alone with my father , never left to care for him by myself  --  except once , and briefly . Everyone was out and I remember the strangeness of being in the house alone with him . I asked him , did he want to watch TV ? When he was crazy , the television ran constantly . I flipped the dial from sports to cartoons to network coverage of the last lunar mission , Apollo 17 . Then he spoke  --  it was a miracle , like hearing a child 's first words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up all the sunglasses I could find . Despite his ongoing bouts of insanity , he was still my father , no crazier than the dads in the Old Testament , and I obeyed him . I thought it was a game . I tore through the house . " Thataboy , " he shouted whenever I found a new pair of glasses . I gathered up Jackie 's wire rims , a pair of aviators and blocky tortoise shells , the girls ' red and yellow and green plastic Disney glasses . Ski goggles , protective eyeware . My father arranged them on the floor , shuffled them one way , then another way , and then he asked , " Who do you think we can call about these glasses ? " I said I did n't think there was anyone . And he said , " Well , I guess we 're sitting ducks then . I guess there 's no hope . Is n't there anybody we can call ? " <p> This memory came back to me at the open house . My father had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to wear his glasses . Immediately he looked lost . He stumbled around the house , filling shallow dishes with salted nuts , setting out a cardtable with potato chips and pretzels and pop . There were so many things missing from the house  --  things like family photos and favorite sympathy cards , things that had earned their places on the wall , on the fireplace mantel , simply by virtue of having always been there  --  that my father seemed spatially confused and kept rearranging his dishes of nuts , putting them down on the coffee table , then the end table , then setting them back in their original spots . <p> " Sit down , " I said . <p> " I 'm not supposed to be here , " my father said . " Cynthia asked me to vacate for a while . " <p> Cynthia , the agent , was openly miffed when she saw my father . She introduced prospective buyers to me , and then quickly moved on . I tagged along . She had a proprietary air as she showed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , childless couple upstairs and showed them the master bedroom . She stood by the window and pointed to the view , the long sloping hill , the mountains in the west , offering this vista as a possibility for the future . ' We touted the kitchen , the livingroom . Then we all went downstairs , to the basement . Half of it was unfinished and the other half was panelled in knotty pine . While the Realtor talked about turning the basement into a rumpus room , I lifted the lid of an old Te-Amo cigarbox and found some pennies and pen caps , a few buttons , a harmonica and several hypodermics . When he was fifteen and sixteen , Jackie had been a junkie , and he 'd shoot up in the basement . I 'd find him downstairs , nodded off , a needle dangling from his arm . It felt like ages ago now , my childhood . I closed the box . <p> The most earnest and eager buyers showed up early , followed by a few dreamers who obviously could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tone of things changed . I was standing at the picture window when I saw Mrs. Wooley stroll up the walkway . She was wearing a short skirt and heels . She rang the doorbell , and I let her in . <p> " Bobby , " she said . " I 'm surprised to see you . " <p> She was an intimate of my mother and had to have known , of course , that I 'd left school . She had a daughter my age finishing up at Yale . <p> " Nice to see you Mrs. Wooley , " I said . <p> " Call me Lois , " she said . " I think you can do that now . " I offered her a drink . She looked at her watch and said , " No , thank you . " <p> She bit her lip , and a little pink came off on her teeth . <p> " Last time I saw you , " she said , " was at the funeral . " <p> " You thinking of buying the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Yeah , well , you always are . You live across the street . You 're our neighbor . " <p> " Lois , Lois , " I heard my father say . He clasped her hand and smiled warmly . " It 's been forever . How are you ? " He looked down at this feet . " Things have been crazy . " <p> " So I 've heard , " Mrs. Wooley said . <p> " Can I show you around the house ? " he asked her . <p> Mts . Kayhew tottered across the street and walked up the stone steps to our porch as if avoiding cracks . And shortly after , Mrs. Greyham followed , along with several other women from the neighborhood . My father greeted each of them with the same warm somewhat chastened smile and then , like a docent , he led the entire group on a tour of our house . He was especially kind to Mrs. Kayhew . He took her arm in his and was guiding her up the stairs . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up at a precise angle , as if her blue eyes were pools of water she did n't want to spill . <p> The little group stood on the upstairs landing . All the bedroom doors were closed , and the thickly coated brown paint gave them a certain feel , as if they 'd been sealed shut a long time ago . <p> My father nudged a crucifix with his foot . He 'd knocked it off the wall the day he came home to find my mother gone . The brass Jesus had come un-nailed , and was wedged between two spikes in the bannister . Mrs. Greyham looked at the cross and then at my father . I waited to hear the lie he would tell . <p> " I knocked it off the wall , " Dad said . <p> My dad hitched his trousers and bent down on one knee . He picked up the cross and the Jesus and held them , one in each hand , and then tried to fit them together . <p> He opened his bedroom door , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the half-bath and the big closet still filled with my mother 's clothes . The big king bed still held the outline of my father in the wrinkled sheets , an intaglio of a head and legs and an arm stretching out toward the other pillow . He looked down at the impression , as if he might slip right back into bed , occupying the mold of himself . <p> My father offered to make a pot of tea . <p> " Tea ? " I blurted out . <p> " That 's okay , " my dad said . <p> But none of these women had come to see the house , which was unexceptional ; they 'd come to see him . Now they were ready to leave . <p> When they left , I asked my father if he 'd like to have a drink . The last light faded from the day and the streetlamps were flickering to life . My father seemed dispirited . <p> " I think I 'll just sit , " he said . He pointed to his chair in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down and removed his wingtips , his navy socks , and began massaging his feet . <p> " Boy , they 're sore , " he said , squeezing his toes . <p> He sat in the dark , very quietly , as if he 'd discovered a still point . <p> " Any buyers ? " <p> " Huh ? Oh , maybe . " <p> I went to the kitchen and fished my dad 's last babiturate from the garbage can . I rattled the amber bottle and popped the top and dry-swallowed the pill . I used to steal them out of his medicine cabinet all the time . The thing about barbiturates is they make you feel caressed or gently held , your skin humming all over with the touch of a thousand fingers . I sat at the dining table and took apart Miles 's old reel , dabbing drops of Remington gun oil on the pawls , and then went outside and rigged up the fly rod , drawing the line through the guides . I stripped out twenty-five feet of line and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , throwing wide loops that dipped low on the backcast and piled up on the forecast , but with each stroke I made a minor adjustment and soon I could feel the rhythm , marking time . To Mrs. Wooley across the street I might have looked like a man sending semaphore to a distant ship . I worked the line until I was casting forty , fifty feet , and the back and forth motion felt substantial , bending the rod down to the butt . I took up a couple extra coils in my left hand and shot those forward . The line sailed smoothly through the guides and unfurled across the street . <p> Holding Miles 's rod in my hand I thought of him , my living , wrecked brother . A few weeks after he jumped from the Aurora Bridge , I decided , one night , to walk out there . I 'm terrified of heights , and I walked slowly out onto the bridge , step by step , my hand rubbing the dirty railing , until I 'd made it midway onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned with sweat . I had not yet looked down but I did n't need to ; the fear rose toward me . I closed my eyes and felt the gritty wind suctioned by oncoming traffic . I heard the clack of tires over the concrete , the screech of a seagull . When I looked down , some three hundred feet , where the black water of Union Bay glinted with city lights , I could n't move , I froze . My legs would n't work . I felt the fall in my stomach , an opening up and a hollowing out . I could n't move forward up the bridge , or back where I 'd come from . I could n't let go of the tail . I might have been there for an hour , easy , when a woman , out walking her dog , came by . My fear of heights overcame my normal fear of speaking to strangers , and I told her I could n't move . " I 'm afraid , " I said , pointing over the edge . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I could cross , " I explained . The woman took my hand . She talked us across , I know , because I remember the sound of her voice , but I have no idea what she said , and on the other side of the bridge I thanked her ridiculously , over and over , and the next day I rode the bus to pick up my truck . <p> My father came out . He was barefoot , but still wore the suit . He scratched the back of his hand , and looked over his shoulders at our house . I lifted the line off the street and started casting again . <p> " I 'll never settle , " he said . <p> " Your choice , I guess . " <p> I kept casting , working the rod back and forth , the line flowing gently in watery curls , whispering over our heads . <p> " It 's beautiful , " my father said . " Like haiku . " <p> " Let me give it a try , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closing his hand around the cork , then closing my hand over his . <p>
