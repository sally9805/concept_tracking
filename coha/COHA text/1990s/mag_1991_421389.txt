A tale of cosmic eggbeaters and born-again pulsars <p> Globular clusters rank among the oldest residents of the Milky Way . Viewed through a telescope , these ancient objects take the breath away : Glowing with the fire of thousands of optically bright stars , they bathe the galaxy in a halo of light . <p> Astronomers have puzzled for years over the evolution of these " mini-galaxies , " an estimated 150 of which surround the core and periphery of the Milky Way ( Globular clusters also accompany many other galaxies . ) Each packs as many as 1 million stars into a spherical space about 200 light-years across , or the diameter of the Milky Way 's disk . <p> Understanding the formation and composition of globular clusters may provide vital information about the evolution of our galaxy , more distant star systems and , perhaps , the universe as a whole , scientists assert . Now investigators may be closer to unlocking the gravitational secrets bound inside these star-packed objects , thanks to new images from the Hubble Space Telescope , as well as recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new observations focus on M15 , a dense globular cluster located about 42,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Pegasus . For nearly 30 years , researchers have debated about what lies at the heart of this object . Some have maintained that a black hole lurks there , while others have argued that the core contains a myriad of compact , burned-out stellar objects called neutron stars . <p> M15 drew special attention in the 1970s when astronomers found that the intensity of light it emits increases steadily from its edge to its core . In fact , ground-based images indicated that a brilliant " spike " of light radiated from the cluster 's center . Although these images could not fully resolve M 15 's tiny core , they suggested that the region contains an unusually dense clump of luminous stars  --  similar to what would surround a supermassive black hole . Moreover , by 1975 , researchers had discovered that the cores of 10 globular clusters orbiting the Milky Way emit intense X-rays  --  radiation that could be generated by matter falling onto a black hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports prompted several researchers , including John N. Bahcall of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , N.J. , and Jeremiah P. Ostriker of Princeton University to propose that a black hole more massive than 1,000 suns resides at the core of each cluster . <p> But in the early 1980s , results from the Earth-orbiting Einstein X-ray Observatory contradicted that interpretation . The observatory found that M15 's intermittent X-ray emissions originate from sources a small distance from the center , a discovery at odds with the black hole scenario . <p> That finding thrust to the fore an alternative theory to explain the character of globular clusters and their spectral emissions : that M15 and other X-ray-emitting clusters contain a large number of neutron stars . Less dense than a black hole , neutron stars nonetheless possess an exceptionally strong gravitational field  --  one powerful enough to capture another star and form a special type of binary system . Indeed , given the abundant supply of neighboring stars inside M15 's core , a neutron star would have ample opportunity to couple with a lower-mass companion . Material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot disk around the neutron star , radiating X-rays similar to those detected from M15 , notes astronomer Haldan N. Cohn of Indiana University in Bloomington . <p> The fact that these binaries would reside throughout the core of the cluster could account for the off-center location of the observed radiation , he adds . Helping to clinch that argument , French astronomer Michel Aurire reported in 1984 finding an ultraviolet counterpart to M15 's X-ray emissions . While the disk of material surrounding a neutron star would emit both ultraviolet and X-ray light , the matter encircling a black hole should only emit X-rays . <p> Still , the debate persisted . Some theorists suggested reviving the black hole model in the mid-1980s as improved ground-based , visible-light observations ( though still lacking full resolution of the core ) continued to indicate an intense spike of light coming from M 15 's center . In the December 1989 ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL , Patrick Seitzer of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , along with colleagues from the University of Chicago and the Whipple Observatory near Amado , Ariz. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their velocity measurements of stars in M15 indicated that those nearest the core had , on average , significantly higher speeds  --  an indication that M 15 and objects like it might contain a black hole massive enough to pull in surrounding stars at high speed . <p> Enter the Hubble Space Telescope . For nearly a decade , researchers studying globular clusters pinned their hopes on this long-awaited orbiting observatory They anticipated that Hubble 's images , expected to have unprecedented clarity , would finally resolve the cluster controversy But shortly after Hubble 's long-delayed launch last year , their hopes appeared dashed . The instrument 's flawed primary mirror placed a fuzzy halo around every star it tried to sharply image , and the swarm of stars in the core of M 15 proved no exception . <p> Scientists analyzing Hubble 's images of M 15 , taken last fall , faced a second hurdle : At the ultraviolet wavelength they chose to study , a handful of stars known as red giants shines as brightly as the thousands of other stars inside the core of M15 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' blinding light confounded the results , preventing scientists from determining whether an intense spike of light  --  the hallmark of a hidden black hole  --  truly existed in the globular cluster . <p> By using computer techniques , Tod R. Lauer of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories in Tucson , Ariz. , Jon A. Holtzman of Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Ariz. , and Sandra M. Faber of the University of California , Santa Cruz , found a solution . With the help of image processing , the astronomers erased the Hubble-generated fuzzy halos and subtracted the bright red giants from their images , leaving behind a background of less luminous but far more abundant stars . <p> These processed images  --  the first to apparently map stars at the core of M 15 proved surprising , Lauer says . They confirmed that M 15 's central region is indeed dense , containing nearly 7,000 stars in a core only 0.8 light-year in diameter about one-fifth the distance between our sun and its closest stellar neighbor . But what of the ultimate test ? " If there 's a massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit area should keep climbing up as you go to the center , " says astrophysicist Shrinivas Kulkarni of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena . Instead , Hubble 's images reveal that the density at M 15 's core plateaus at a density just 1 percent of that expected if a massive black hole were present . <p> " On a very basic level , this finding does n't support the black hole picture at all , " notes Kulkarni . <p> In fact , says Lauer , the results suggest that M15 's core has already reached its point of maximal collapse and has begun to reexpand . He and his colleagues speculate that rapidly orbiting star pairs formed when the cluster 's core was denser . Acting like cosmic eggbeaters , they transferred enough kinetic energy to nearby stars to fling them to the outskirts of the core , or even eject them . Thus , temporarily at least , the core is bouncing back , growing less dense . Lauer and his colleagues reported their findings at a meeting in January of the American Astronomical Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's findings remains speculative , Kulkarni and other astronomers note that this new scenario dovetails with recent ground-based observations suggesting M15 and other globular clusters may possess a surprising abundance of single neutron stars and binaries . A series of surprising observational discoveries since 1988 have uncovered at least 40 radio-emitting pulsars in Milky Way globular clusters . Flashing like cosmic lighthouses , the pulsars rotate rapidly enough to beam radio waves at Earth every few hundredths of a second . Astronomers believe that the strong magnetic fields of spinning neutron stars generate such pulses . <p> Using the 300-meter radio telescope at the Arecibo ( Puerto Rico ) Observatory , Kulkarni and his colleagues found five such pulsars in M15 . The research team , which included Stuart B. Anderson , Aleksander Wolszczan and Thomas A. Prince of Caltech , describes its work in the July 5 , 1990 NATURE and in an upcoming ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS . Other teams , including scientists at the Parkes ( Australia ) Radio Observatory , have found radio pulsars in the globular clusters 47 Tucanae , M28 and M4 . <p> These findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a binary star system  --  play a key role in the evolution of globular clusters , say Kulkarni and other researchers . <p> Without the option of forming a binary , all rotating neutrons stars in the ancient Milky Way clusters  --  now about 15 billion years old  --  would have long ago spun down , exhausted by the braking action of their own magnetic fields . Radio emissions would have come to a halt , Kulkarni notes . But just as some of these stars were about to sing their swan song , they paired off with a neighboring , lower-mass star in the cluster 's core , he says . Instead of dying , the neutron stars captured material from their new companion and spun back up . <p> These " born-again " pulsars , says Kulkarni , account for the recently detected radio pulsars . The same tightly bound , spinning binaries could also act as cosmic eggbeaters , he adds , kicking out of the core lower-mass stars that happen to pass by the orbiting duo . Caltech astronomers E.S . Phinney and Steinn Sigurdsson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the June 10 , 1990 ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL , Kulkarni and other collaborators from Caltech and the University of Arizona calculate that Milky Way globular clusters likely contain 10,000 pulsars . Since only about 10 percent of neutron stars form these rapid rotators , the Milky Way clusters may contain an astonishing 100,000 of these very compact stars , Kulkarni told SCIENCE NEWS . <p> Though the prevailing wisdom held that only big , dense clusters contained a pulsar , " we 're finding pulsars even in clusters that people two years ago would have laughed off as being unimportant for this kind of work , " Kulkarni says . " Even the scruffiest lowest-density globular cluster seems to have a pulsar . " Most important of all , he adds , the abundance of neutron stars inside globular clusters suggests that most of these stars  --  created in the aftermath of a supernova explosion  --  formed early in the development of the universe . <p> At the January meeting of the American Astronomical Society Brian W. Murphy of the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands reported on optical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clusters . Working at La Palma Observatory in the Canary Islands of Spain , he and colleagues from four other institutions detected strong calcium emissions from the center of M15 . Murphy says these emissions signify high magnetic activity , either from rapidly rotating single stars or from binary systems . <p> Since single stars in the aging cluster can not spin fast , Murphy believes that light from calcium atoms originates in binaries . Paired stars produce the light when their large magnetic field heats the outer layer of the neutron star 's partner , he proposes . Beyond their intrinsic interest for Milky Way astronomers , studies of our galaxy 's globular clusters may also shed light on more distant collections of stars , says Cohn . Collaborating with Robert P. Grabhorn and Phyllis M. Lugger at Indiana University he has designed several computer simulations of the structure and evolution of globular clusters . Their venerable age , he and other astronomers contend , represents a lower limit for the age of the universe as estimated from redshift measurements and the apparent velocity of distant galaxies . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter to the age determined by stellar evolution  --  of globular clusters , " Cohn notes . <p> Moreover , he says , these clusters provide a laboratory for understanding how densely packed stars interact gravitationally " It gives us a nearby analog to active galactic nuclei  --  clusters of 100 million or more stars at the centers of galaxies that very likely do have supermassive black holes at their core , " he says . " We develop theories similar to the globular cluster theories to explain how stars in active galactic nuclei , which are thousands of times more distant , interact with each other . " <p> " If we can understand the relatively nearby globular clusters , we have a much better basis for understanding what 's going on in galactic nuclei and quasars , " Cohn says . The newest model developed by Cohn and his collaborators indicates that the core of M 15 may have undergone periodic collapse and expansion several times before its latest apparent reexpansion . <p> Several mysteries about globular clusters continue to perplex astronomers . For instance , Kulkarni notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so many neutron stars inside clusters did not rip apart these star-packed regions . He speculates that certain stars  --  " halo " stars orbiting the outskirts of the Milky Way  --  may in fact represent remnants of globular clusters that did n't survive the violent creation of neutron stars . <p> " If that is true , " Kulkarni concludes , " we have really learned a lot from pulsars and globular clusters .

Computer processing has removed obscuring bright light from red giant stars , revealing the distribution of the dimmer , more numerous stars at the center . The absence of a bright " spike " of light indicates that a supermassive black hole does not lurk there . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Map of globular clusters ( circles ) superimposed on schematic of the Milky Way .
