The Bard of Avon taught us that Hell has no fury to rival these eponymous women . But enough of Satan 's realm-what of our own plane of existence ? Robert Grossbach , whoses last story for us was the popular Blew on a Chip " ( Dec. 1997 ) , investigates the question from an intriguing technological viewpoint . <p> T CORNAVIN STATION the rental agency had given him one of the new Electriques with the re-designed fuel cells , and he 'd accepted it reluctantly , knowing it would not have the pickup of the old gas-driven models . Yes , yes , of course it was a thousand times better for the environment , ten thousand times , but still he liked the feel of the gas pedal , preferred it over the accelerator . One more thing to make him cranky , as if the TGV ride from Paris , his sore left buttock , and France 's first round World Cup elimination were n't irritants enough . He drove now on the Route de Meyrin , westbound from Geneva , passing a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , an automated radar speed monitor , and a Citroen dealership , regarding all with a faintly disapproving and dyspeptic eye , which was how he viewed everything , for reasons he 'd never cared to plumb . After eight kilometers , he arrived at a hangar-sized building of corrugated metal , situated amidst a scattered complex of structures , all surrounded by a paved parking lot and double chainlink fence . The sign over the guard booth read ORC ; ANT oN EUROPIENE POUR LA RECHERCHE Nuc. , or , as the English and Americans called it , CERN ignoring in their usual obtuse manner that the first word had been changed from CONSEIL nearly seven decades earlier .. ) He flashed his credential at the guard , passed with an indifferent wave through a flimsy looking gate , and parked next to a blue Mercedes . He locked the doors of the Electrique out of habit , and trudged toward the building , upper left hamstring throbbing at each step . On a low hill just beyond the complex , he thought he could see sheep grazing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance . He signed in at a long , polished wooden desk , filling in the " Name , " " Entry Time , " and " Person to Be Seen " columns , but leaving blank the " Purpose of Visit " space . When the young receptionist had finished on the phone , she presented him with a plastic yellow rectangle that identified him as a visitor . " Ici est votre - " " English will be fine , " he said . She nodded . " Here is your badge , Inspector . Someone will be out momentarily to escort you . " He grunted a thank you , then went to stand awkwardly near one of the vinyl waiting-area couches , pausing to knead his eyebrows and temples in a futile attempt to ward off the headache he already knew was inevitable . When he looked up a moment later , a fortyish woman stood before him , wearing a loose blouse and pleated gray skirt . " Inspector Lagrange ? " Short black hair framed a slightly roundish Kewpie-doll face : button nose , cherub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lagrange thought her just short of pretty . " I 'm here to see Dr. Elizabeth Parkes , " he said . " I am she . " Apparently , his expression did not sufficiently conceal his reactions . " I do not fit your conception of a nuclear physicist ? " He smiled back . " No , no , it 's just ... the receptionist said they were sending somebody . I assumed - " He waved his hand . " It 's of no importance . " She stared at him bemusedly . " Well then , shall we ? " She motioned toward a doorway . " I assume you 'd like a look at the experiment first ? " " That would be fine , yes . " She held the door , and he stepped through . The hangar area was vast ; they padded along a blue steel catwalk past a dozen rows of huge , thrumming machines . " Generators , " said Elizabeth , over the din . " They feed the superconducting magnets for the accelerator . " " They give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pain in his head and his ass ; he supposed somewhere along the way he 'd stub a toe . They emerged finally into the rear half of the building , seemingly empty except for a giant overhead crane suspended from a heavy steel girder . But as they approached the far end , Lagrange suddenly saw that a huge section of floor simply vanished into a cavernous rectangular pit . He fought off vertigo as they stared over the edge . " Six stories deep , " said Elizabeth . At the bottom , amidst scattered pieces of equipment , tools , and ladders was a structure that looked like two piggy-backed railroad cars . **26;1898;TOOLONG ropes of cable , numbering in the hundreds , ran from the cars up the sides of the pit and disappeared into boxes of electronics that lined the walls . Lagrange pointed to a circle on the roof of the top car . " That 's where Monsieur Parino entered ? " Elizabeth nodded . " A hatch . Hard to tell from up here . " " And you 're absolutely certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment ? " She shrugged . " You should know , Inspector . Your people have been over that structure about a thousand times . " " Not my people . " " You 're Swiss ? I 'm sorry , I just assumed you were French . I know there was some sort of a jurisdictional dispute because the tunnel straddles the border and - " " I 'm with Europol . " Her eyes rose in feigned admiration . " Ah , Europol . Yes , someone said they were sending an expert . " " Hardly an expert , " said Lagrange . " Far far from it . But I suppose , relative to my local colleagues , I am perhaps ever so slightly more educated in the area . " " Would you like to go down to make an examination ? " she asked . " I 'm sorry , but there are no elevators , we 'll have to use the ladders . " Immediately , Lagrange felt his buttock spasm in anticipation . " That wo n't be necessary , I 've studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the pit , five stories below . " That 's where the beams emerge ? " " That 's the opening into the collider tunnel , yes , but " emerge " is perhaps not the right word . In operation , of course , the tunnel is continuous through the experiment . An extremely high vacuum must be maintained . " Somehow , she seemed to sense his discomfort . " Would you be more at ease in another area ? " " That would be fine Yes . " said Lagrange . They exited the building by a rear door , emerged into bright sunlight . Almost immediately , he tripped over a raised section of concrete walkway , winced as he regained his balance . " Are you okay ? " She reached out to steady his arm and momentarily , quite against his will , he became aroused . How pathetic , he thought , that the mere incidental touch of a woman could do that to him . " I 'm fine , " he said . " I strained a hamstring while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose , to stop trying to interfere with her course . " " Now you sound like Giorgio . " " Really In what wav ? " " He was always talking about death . Well , alluding to it , anyway . That is , when he was n't talking about physics . He seemed to feel he was racing against a timetable . He wanted to get the Nobel while he could appreciate it . " They entered a narrow , two-story building that connected at an odd angle to two other identical structures . " He was disappointed he did n't get it for the Higgs ... " " You know about the Higgs ? " They walked down an asbestos-tiled corridor . " Not much . I know it 's the name given to fields of some sort and also to the particles that presumably transmit them . Higgs bosons , I believe they 're called . Goldman found the first one right here and got the prize - when was it ? - about fifteen years ago . " " Two thousand three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been his . " They entered a small cantina . Candy and Coke machines on one wall . Ten tables and chairs . Microwave oven . Coffee stand . " This okay ? " she asked . " Anything , " he said . " As long as I do n't have to hear those generators . " They sat at one of the tables , and she brought over some caf6 au lait . He sipped at the Styrofoam cup . " So Giorgio was bitter . " " Oh , of course , " she said quickly . " Is n't that de rigueur for world class physicists who feel they 're being overlooked ? Bitter , driven , obsessed , callous " - her voice deepened , her gaze drifted off- " manipulative , cold , self-absorbed- " " But you were in love with him . " Her focus abruptly returned . " As I said , I 've seen the reports , " he added , almost apologetically . " It was in the interviews . " She shrugged . " I was at one time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossip like anyone else . " " And was the love reciprocated ? " He could see the hurt ripple across her features , and he leaned forward . " Mademoiselle Parkes , I am truly sorry for what I realize must seem like an outrageous intrusion into your personal life , but I beg you to try to understand my position . Giorgio Parino was perhaps the world 's greatest experimental physicist . His disappearance under the conditions of the experiment - " " Some of us would not call it a disappearance . " He nodded stiffly . He was not quite ready for semantic scientific nitpicking . " Nevertheless , the pressure from the authorities and the public and the press for a complete explanation- " " Fuck the authorities ! " said Elizabeth . " And the public . And the press . And - " " And the police . Of course , " filled in Lagrange , grinning . She softened , grinned back . " Of course . " He drained his cup . " Tell me about the Higgs . " She pursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of field . Still far from being understood . The Large Hadron Collider we have here was meant to investigate it . Current ideas have been expanded from theories first developed in the 1980s and " 90s to explain how the electroweak force , which is transmitted by four zero-mass particles , could be transformed into two separate forces , one of which has massive particles as its carrier . The thinking was - is - that there 's some kind of a field , the Higgs , that permeates all of space and that gave particles their masses when the early universe congealed . " " And the collider is able to remelt that field . " " You smash together two beams of protons at seventeen terravolts , you get a hell of a lot of interesting effects . " " Including travel through time ? " Again , she smiled . Then stood up . " Let 's walk . You feel like walkin ? of He did n't . " Fine . " " I 'll show you the Megatek room . " " Okay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know , Lagrange is a famous name in physics , " she said . " Unfortunately , yes , " he responded . " So my mother used to inform me practically every day . Even at one time claimed he was my ancestor , although I doubt it . If he was , I 'm afraid I 'd have been a terrible disappointment to him . " " You were not a good student ? " " I barely managed to eke out a masters at Columbia . " " Ah , so that explains your excellent English : You went to school in the States . " " As I said , my family had hopes . Fortunately , the experience demonstrated quite clearly that I 'd never be any more than a third-rate physicist , if that . " They turned a corner . " You must not let others " opinions of you become your own , " she said with unusual intensity . " I had to constantly fight with Giorgio . " " He considered you third-rate ? " No answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said ... " She swallowed . Muscles worked high in her jaw . " He said I was very good on the details , but that I did n't have the vision to be truly insightful . He said he realized it sounded sexist , but that all the women scientists he 'd known seemed to have the same restricted perspective . Tunnel vision , " he called it , and then he 'd laugh , because of-I do n't know - some private double entendre . He said I was wonderful at poring over data and attending to minute individual tasks and that I should n't beat myself to death trying to be something I was not . " " And you did n't , I presume . " " No . " " Did you beat him to death ? " They came to a room marked " Megatek , " and she paused at the door . " Am I being charged with a crime , Inspector ? Is this an official Europol interrogation or a casual conversation ? " Lagrange shrugged . " The answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Official interrogation . " I apologize if my manner has been too informal . " She frowned , but Lagrange could see that the gesture was theatrical . " Perhaps I should have an attorney present . " He nodded slightly . " With all due respect , Dr. Parkes , this is not America . There is no Miranda law here , nor any direct equivalent of habeas corpus . " She unlocked the door . " Whatever Giorgio did , he did to himself . " Inside the room were a half dozen scattered computer terminals , a shelf-lined wall filled with black notebooks , a bulletin board sprinkled with particle-collision photos , and finally , in the center , two large machines that looked like three-D video games . It was in these , the Megateks , that computer enhanced , three-dimensional recreations of the experiments in the collider pit could be displayed . " Some people say you could have stopped him . " " I tried . He would n't listen . " " But it was you who threw the switch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make me a criminal ? " " Perhaps . There are several dependencies . " " Such as ... " " Such as what exactly has happened to him . Such as whether you knew the consequences of his order . " " He was Director General of CERN , my immediate supervisor . " " Nevertheless , if your direct superior commands you to fire a loaded gun at his head and you do it " - he held out his hands - " the law says you are guilty of murder . And no matter that he is an arrogant , patronizing , womanizing bastard . " He paused . " Now , did you know the consequences of throwing that switch ? " She inhaled deeply . " I ... " She shook her head . " Giorgio had so undermined my confidence I could n't be sure of anything . I doubted my own mind . " " So you were n't certain ? " " No . " " But you are more confident now . " " I am more confident now , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gateks , fiddled with the joystick . " How did Giorgio first get the idea about time travel ? " She leaned over one of the computers , began punching a few keys . " Here , better to show than tell . " A moment later , at the center of his machine 's holographic projection volume , a schematic display of a detector appeared : cylinder for the central portion , larger cylinder for the electromagnetic calorimeters , rectangle for the hadronic calorimeters . She punched another button and , instantly , thirty or forty multi-colored spaghetti tracks shot through the display . " A reproduction of event 1431 , " she said . " The detector assembly surrounds the location where the protons collide . " She hit another key , and all but a half-dozen of the tracks disappeared . She moved a joystick to enlarge the display . Three-inch-long traces fanned outward from a single point . " A jet , " said Elizabeth . " Not that uncommon . The energy was 11.3 terravolts . Now " - again her tapered fingers flew over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time passes . " The traces slowly extended in length . " Each inch on the display scale takes about .2 picoseconds . " Suddenly , at about four inches , each trace seemed to double , joined by an adjacent twin , which streaked alongside it for about an inch and a half before disappearing . Lagrange turned , brow knit , palms up . " I 'm sorry , I do n't understand . " " No one did , " said Elizabeth . " Particles identical in every Fermi number-I know it 's impossible-had appeared from nowhere alongside the originals . Giorgio finally made the mental leap . " Lagrange 's mouth opened in a silent Ah . " There were no new particles . The originals simply moved back in time to join themselves at an earlier instant . " Elizabeth nodded . " The Higgs field had melted , mass had disappeared - and popped back about .3 picoseconds . The calculations confirmed there was a chunk of energy missing ; Giorgio called it tau-sub-e , the temporal component . " " A totally unexpected effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giorgio immediately recognized the macroscopic ramifications . " Lagrange shook his head . " The effect had occurred over a linear extent of nearly a millimeter , but there was no reason why that could not be expanded arbitrarily . Apparently - Have you read his 2017 Physical Review paper ? " Lagrange said he had , but with very limited comprehension . " Apparently , " she continued , " as the universe cooled , the Higgs field congealed into microscopic domains , separated by walls like , mmm ... " As she searched for an analogy , a tiny crevice appeared between her eyebrows ; despite himself , Lagrange found it charming . " Like that plastic bubble paper they use to wrap gifts . The colliding beams popped the bubbles , releasing their energy . " She raised her eyebrows . " Anyway , Giorgio did the calculations for how to scan the beams so the bubbles would coalesce into a volume of arbitrary size . " " And inside the volume , " ventured Lagrange , " whatever was there would move backward in time ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him two Nobel prizes , one was n't enough . " She grinned . " I suggested he should hold the prize a few minutes , then move back in time and stand alongside himself . " The grin vanished . " He took you seriously . " " Not immediately . His first priority was to go around the world , giving speeches . You understand , he was an incredible hero to physicists everywhere . He must 've visited a hundred different countries . " " While the rest of the staff ... " " Eighty of us . Studied the effect , repeated it , tried to understand it , tried to extend it . Eventually , we built a six-cubic-meter test chamber , used a magnetic field to suspend and levitate it in a vacuum - and sent it back approximately 3.3 picoseconds . " " You must 've been ecstatic . " She gave a little snort . " I was disturbed . I felt there was something fundamental we were missing . " " And that 's when you gave the speech . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire staff to discuss recent events in time travel . A conference room . Ninety-six yellow chairs in six even rows blackboard in front , TV monitors lining one wall . Giorgio had taken a sub-orbital from Tokyo to attend . Seven or eight of the physicists had gotten up to speak , discoursing on this or that arcane area , making recommendations , complaining fending off Giorgio 's staccato questions and comments . Finally , it was Elizabeth 's turn . She took the low podium , hesitantly began to talk , showed several prepared slides . Unfortunately , she could not quite conceptualize what was bothering her , and when you could not quite conceptualize , Giorgio jumped down your throat . " So the photographs were fuzzy , " he rasped . " So what . Clean your camera lenses . " A chuckle rippled through the audience . " They were clean , Giorgio . And the focus was checked . " " So what is your point ? " " There ... there is some spatial effect associated with time travel . Perhaps it is second-order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth , your data hardly justifies the conclusion . Frankly , I would n't even call it data . " " But the chamber ... My measurements show it shifted nearly a millimeter - " " Oh , so we 're measuring distances now ? Very good . Did you use a wooden ruler or a metal one ? " More laughter , much of it strained . " I used a laser calipers . " " Ah , pardon me . I underestimated your technical ability . " Openly , savagely patronizing now . " Elizabeth , we are talking about a six cubic meter volume , subject to quite substantial forces here . Why are you surprised by a minuscule movement ? Why do you think it 's important ? Have you checked the magnetic field servos ? Have you checked the uncertainties in the energy budgets ? " " I tried , but I couldn't- " " Have you done any supporting calculations ? Any math at all ? Any thinking at all before you came up here with these details ? Details are fine , Dr. Parkes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little perspective on what is not a waste of time ? " White-faced , choking , Elizabeth had whispered a " sorry " and fled the stage . Lagrange leaned back . " He humiliated you . " She nodded . " In front of everybody , " she whispered . " You left the conference ? " " Of course . I studied the minutes afterward . " He pictured her , alone in some small room , a high school girl who 'd missed the senior prom , reading about it instead in some dry secondhand report . He wanted to hug her , tell her he was a kindred soul in personal disappointment . But almost as if readinghis thoughts-and rejecting them-she drew herself up . " I was angry . I felt " - her eyes blazed - " I may be an inferior scientist , but sometimes an inferior does good work . A hack writer comes up with a great novel . A poor soccer team beats a much better one . " She thrust out her chin . " An average detective has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " So you felt you were onto something and were being ignored . " " More accurately , I felt Giorgio was missing something . I guess , at bottom , what was really bothering me was the old grandfather paradox . You know , somebody goes back in time and kills their own grandfather , so that they were never born ... which means they were n't around to go back in time . " Lagrange crossed his legs . " You did n't buy the many-universe theories ? As I understand it , the concept is that when someone goes back in time he is really travelling to another universe , which is identical with the first up to the instant of his arrival , but different thereafter because of his presence . That way- " " In the universe he leaves , his grandfather is alive and he is born . In the one he enters , his grandfather dies , and he is n't born . " She shook her head . " That was Giorgio 's explanation and most of the others ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CTC 's , between universes . " She chuckled mirthlessly . " To me , it sounded like magic . Invoke enough different universes and you can explain anything . It was n't true understanding . And I had my experiments . There 's something that working with actual hardware gives you - I know it sounds mystical but there 's something that world travelers get out of touch with . " The door opened then and two men entered , dressed casually in slacks and open-coll ; ar shirts . Lagrange stood up , withdrew his wallet , and flashed his badge . " Gentlemen , I 'm sorry , but I must ask you to leave . We 'll only be another five minutes . " The men seemed uncertain , but eventually departed . " You know them ? " asked Lagrange , when they 'd gone . " Not well , , " said Elizabeth . " The younger one 's been here a year , some kind of mathematician from Colltge de France . The other fellow I believe is Russian , specializes in muon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright idea . Do you think it was always in the back of his mind ? " She shrugged . " I doubt it . I think it was one of those spur of the moment things , one of those flamboyant I-am-the-boss megalomaniac power moves he loved so much . " " Then it was for the benefit of the Japanese ? " " Partly , yes . They had sent in a large visiting delegation . They were talking about a huge funding increment  --  that 's what it 's all about in high-energy physics , as it 's always been - and Giorgio was anxious to make a grand impression . " " And that 's when you picked to tell him you thought the experiments might not be safe . " He raised his eyebrows . " Awkward timing , no ? " She bristled . " It was n't " timing " at all . I broached it to him as soon as I felt I had a solid basis for it . A couple of the Japanese just happened to be in the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And your concern was - " " The small spatial dislocations I 'd mentioned earlier . I was worried about what might happen if an object interpenetrated an earlier version of itself . " " But Dr. Parino did not share your anxiety . " " He was furious with me for bringing it up . As it turned out , he was right . There was a problem , but that was n't it . " " Nevertheless , he decided to demonstrate the process safety by using himself as the subject of an experiment . " Lagrange began tapping his foot . " How did he justify that ? " " He did n't , really . In his position , you did n't have to . Oh , later on he offered up some mumbo jumbo about taking a bit of future information into the past , something that required a human mind , in order to test or dispel the so-called knowledge paradox . An example would be paintings brought from the future to the original artist in the past , who copies them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one considered that seriously . We all knew Giorgio was just being Giorgio . " " Was it his idea to go a full five seconds backward ? Was n't that trillions of times longer than you 'd sent anything else ? " " It had already been shown that the regression in time depended exponentially on the rate at which you melted the Higgs domains , not the collision energy . It meant only that we had to increase our luminosity and scanning speed . Giorgio claimed five seconds was the minimum duration required for his future self to record and bring back a number they could be photographed with next to a sealed clock . " " The Paris closing gold price . " " Yes . " " What did the other physicists think of his plan ? " " That he was entirely crazy , of course . But it was a genius move for publicity . " " And were they worried , too , about safety ? " " Oh , most agreed it was rash , but no one could justify their feelings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some lipstick from a tiny purse she carried . " Giorgio was not the kind of person who inspired feelings of protection . " " Except in you . " She stopped applying the lipstick . " I was up the entire night before the experiment . That was when I figured everything out . " " You could see him from the control room ? " She nodded . Lagrange remembered the tape - control room activity was always recorded . Sixty television monitors . Two dozen physicists sitting at consoles , hunched over screens , harried , looking up to scan a readout , to shout something , to scream a command . On one of the consoles , Giorgio strides confidently toward the pit in the hangar floor . Underground area fifteen , or UA15 , the time travel experiment . He says something to one of the Japanese visitors and the man smiles . Giorgio is wearing an orange jumpsuit , a white lined pad under his arm . WAITING FOR A COMMAND scrolls down one of the monitors . WAITING FOR A COMMAND . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Firing away , " says another . " I got it in the logbook . " A mechanical voice announces , " Proton check , " and three of the screens fill up with numbers and graphs . A moment later , the voice declares , " SPS ready , " and more numbers tumble onto additional displays . The camera catches Elizabeth , sitting at the main control panel . Her face is gaunt , her eyes wide . She uses a microphone to address people in the hangar . " Giorgio , I beg you not to do this . I beg you . " Giorgio waves and smiles , pats the Japanese on the shoulder . Lagrange shook his head . " Why did he make you the SLIMI ? " SLIMI was Shift Leader In Matters of Information . Elizabeth spoke in a near whisper . " It was n't that unusual . I had done it before . " She inhaled sharply . " I suppose it was further punishment . " Lagrange recalled the final moments . Giorgio descending the ladder into the pit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mechanical voice saying , " Beam scanning sequence ready , " and Elizabeth making one futile last attempt . " Giorgio , please ... please ... " And the response : " Is the gold price in ? As soon as it comes in , close the fucking switch and read me the fucking number when the counter goes down to two . I order it , Elizabeth . " She hesitates several seconds , looks around at the other physicists , whose expressions are maintained at careful neutrality . A man wearing headphones approaches her and whispers something . She delays another moment and then , finally , chest heaving , she presses a key . The mechanical voice says , " Cycle one , " and begins a countdown from nine to zero . At two , Elizabeth reads in the Paris close in New Dollars per ounce , 29.32 . At zero , small dips appear on lines crossing three of the monitors . Even in the hangar , there never was any sound . When the Time Chamber disappeared , it happened in vacuum ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and stretched . " You knew immediately , of course . " Elizabeth nodded . " All instrument readouts from the chamber went dead . " He began to slowly pace , ignoring the hamstring twinges . " You knew where he 'd be ? " " Not exactly . I knew how far , but not precisely the direction . " " So it was more or less luck that Farside II happened to be pointed toward that sector . " " I suppose . Chances were some telescope would catch it . " " Your distance was correct ? " A faint grin . " Within experimental error . " " Your so-called equivalence principle ... " She puffed her lips . " It seemed reasonable . Travel through space requires time , therefore , travel through time might very well require space . " " It resolves the grandfather paradox . " " It occurred to me the night before the experiment . You ca n't kill your grandfather if you ca n't reach him . If you travel through time , you ca n't affect anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're flung far enough away from your original position . " " But how far is far enough ' ? " " In general , the speed of light multiplied by the time interval . Nothing could travel back fast enough to cause a problem . The universe could protect itself from inconsistencies and non-causal events , it did n't need other universes to help . " He pondered a moment . " But what if you 're transported right near your grandfather , whom you immediately murder ? " She shook her head . " Either he 'd have already sired your parent , so it would n't matter , or he could n't have been your grandfather . In tech-speak , in the time interval you went back , no concatenation of world lines could traverse as much distance as you did . " Lagrange was content to grasp the essence . " So , therefore , when Monsieur Parino was popped back five seconds in time , in space he was thrust - " Her eyebrows rose . " A million and a half kilometers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you . The interview is officially concluded . If you could see me back to UA15 ... " She stood . " Of course . " They exited the Megatek room . The two men who 'd entered before were waiting outside and eyed them venomously as they receded down the hall . " So tell me , Inspector , " she asked , " am I to be charged ? " Lagrange : looked at her alongside him , pursed his lips . " Well , that is not for me to decide , mademoiselle . I only make a report . " He could not keep a straight face . " But I think not . " At a corner , he dared take her arm . " I think not . " He had heard talk that it was she now who might get the Nobel , sharing it with the departed Giorgio for " the Parkes-Parino principle . " " Have you seen the actual pictures from Farside II , Inspector ? " " Oh yes , " said Lagrange . " Quite beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment to imagine himself in Parino 's shoes . There was a porthole in the chamber and he undoubtedly had looked out . Lagrange wondered if he 'd been able to see the Earth from his position , how small it must 've appeared from a million kilometers beyond the moon , how resplendent amidst the jeweledbackground of scattered stars , how achingly , utterly unreachable ... " The glare made the chamber look almost like a comet . " " Well , " said Elizabeth , " there is a fair amount of energy associated with temporal re-entry . " An impish expression crossed her face . " And , of course , Giorgio always was brilliant . " Unprofessional as it was , Lagrange laughed .
