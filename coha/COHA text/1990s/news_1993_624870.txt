<p> It is a typical afternoon in the Recoleta neighborhood of Buenos Aires . <p> In the plaza facing Pilar Church , a somewhat ragtag , 50-ish couple is dancing a sultry tango , accompanied by a lone accordion player . Dozens of people look on , some joining in the dance . <p> A few feet away , groups of portenos , as residents of the capital are called , are sitting around tables , sipping espresso . <p> Most are dressed in designer jeans and sweat shirts . <p> Their children play in the shadow of a huge " " gomero , " or rubber tree . <p> Few places in Latin America offer a greater sense of urban well-being than Buenos Aires . And an afternoon at the Recoleta is perhaps the best way to experience it . <p> Unlike most American cities , the center of Buenos Aires is residential , home to the upper and upper-middle classes . <p> Argentines stroll along the streets late into the night with little fear of harm .

Shows nightly except Mondays . <p> A soccer game here is both a cultural and sporting event . <p> The largest stadium is River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three miles north of the center . <p> The stadium in the barrio of La Boca , known as " " Bombonera , " 805 Brandsen , where the Boca Juniors team plays , has a rowdier crowd , but the heat of the Argentine spirit is felt more intensely . <p> There is at least one game at one of the stadiums every weekend .
