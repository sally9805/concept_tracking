<p> Of all the marquee elements attached to yet another Dallas Cowboys vs . Washington Redskins clash on Monday Night Football , purists welcome the latest debate : Who 's got the best cornerbacks ? <p> Opinions can vary , depending on taste , style , team success and perhaps from one third-and-long situation to the next . <p> Yet when expanding the theme leaguewide , there 's little argument : the Cowboys ' tandem of Deion Sanders-Kevin Smith and the Redskins ' Darrell Green-Cris Dishman duo are at the top of the charts . They are walking textbooks for how to play one of the NFL 's most pressure-packed and heavily scrutinized positions . <p> " Look , I 'm a 37-year-old cornerback , " Green , a 15th-year veteran , said while gearing up for his 208th regular-season game . " Any time anybody says something good about me , I 'll take it . Sounds great . But I do n't go on the field with that . I 've got to play the game . You 're only as good as your last play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been pretty good . <p> The Redskins have allowed the fewest passing yards per game in the NFL ( 134.6 ) and , thanks to Green and Dishman , have given up one passing touchdown through five games . <p> Dallas brings the NFL 's No. 2 unit for passing yards per game ( 137.6 ) and total defense to New Jack City , also known as Jack Kent Cooke Stadium ( ABC , tonight , 9 ET ) . Passing TDs allowed ? Four . <p> " I was showing Deion the stats , " Smith said late last week . " The team in front of us is the Redskins . Before this week , they were at 106 ( passing yards per game ) . . . So , it 's something we look at in competing against the rest of the league . But you know , it 's not just the corners . " <p> Still , with the cornerbacks capable of airtight coverage , the Monday Night Football - record 10th meeting between the Cowboys and Redskins could be determined by which team gets its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornerbacks can at least influence this , too . <p> As Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo put it , " Having those two guys ( Sanders and Smith ) on the corner allows you to utilize your safeties in different areas . " <p> In other words , man-to-man cornerback coverage can allow extra safety support in eight-man fronts to challenge the run . <p> New Redskins coordinator Mike Nolan , trying to fix a unit that ranked 28th in the NFL in 1996 , might agree . Dishman , who signed as a free agent last spring after nine seasons with the Oilers , is one reason Washington has reduced its rate of big passing plays allowed while mixing man and zone schemes . <p> " When you 're as experienced as he is , it makes it easier on all of us , " says Green , who still runs a 4.3 in the 40-yard dash and earned his sixth Pro Bowl nod last season . " You do n't get the mental mistakes because he 's seen so much . One of the easiest jobs right now probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It helps that the Redskins cornerbacks are on the same page , bonding from the instant Dishman signed . Then there are the mental notebooks they share in film study sessions , practices and sideline chats while in the heat of the game . <p> Green and Dishman , with combined NFL tenure of nearly 25 years , can write their own thesis on how to cover top receivers . <p> " I 'm always coming to Darrell , asking , ' What did you see on this route ? ' " Dishman says . " There are not too many routes or formations that neither of us has seen . We constantly talk . He works on my technique . He 's like a big brother . <p> " I 've never had a teammate that could really tell me how to play it . I was always the one . But now I 'm the ' other ' cornerback . In Houston , I did n't get much action . But now I 've got to be on the top of my game , or I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can relate . Sanders still goes entire quarters without teams throwing a pass in his direction . Says Campo : " He 'll get two or three passes a game , maybe . Not much has changed . " <p> Before Sanders joined the Cowboys in 1995 , Smith would sometimes long for attention as opponents aimed at opposite corner Larry Brown . But that 's changed . <p> " It 's a lot more pressure , " says Smith , a sixth-year pro . " I have to hold the ship down . Not to knock Larry , but before I was the guy who did n't get a lot of action . Now , we are so much more aggressive in our schemes . We do n't play as much zone as we used to . " <p> Growing up , Smith loved to watch Lester Hayes , so much that he tried to pattern his game after the physical , bump-and-run style of the former Oakland Raiders all-pro . Yet with such an approach , Smith has had unwanted attention ( or as the Cowboys contend , lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been flagged about a half-dozen times this year for pass interference , including two costly downfield calls in the Oct. 5 loss to the New York Giants . <p> Will he alter his approach ? <p> " I 'll be more aggressive , " Smith says with the resilient mind-set good cornerbacks seem to cling to . " It means I just have to do more work on the receivers at the line of scrimmage . They 'll have to work harder at the start of their routes . " <p> Sanders , on the other hand , is often been knocked for not being physical enough . But he 's hardly lacking confidence . <p> He can make his job on the left post sound so easy . <p> " They put a number on a guy and say , ' That 's him . That 's your man . Now go get him , ' " says Sanders , the NFL 's Defensive Player of the Year in 1994 with San Francisco . " We do n't single guys out and try to put one cornerback on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So there 's really no big playbook . We just play a lot of man coverage . " <p> Campo still marvels when considering that Sanders is such a remarkable athlete that he can excel in baseball and football , not to mention as a punt returner , too . <p> Insists Campo , " He has not missed a beat . " <p> Adds Smith : " Maybe the thing that impresses me the most about Deion is his intensity . He loves to compete each play . He 's not getting many passes , but if you watch him on film , he plays like every pass is coming his way . " <p> The special ones always leave a distinct impression . In Green 's case , part of that is his ability to take a 5-8 , 184-pound frame and still match up to taller , stronger wideouts . <p> " Darrell Green is the Charles Barkley of the NFL , " former NFL all-pro safety Ronnie Lott says . " You know how they say Barkley is 6-4 but plays at 6-8 ? That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I call ' climb the body ' of the big boys . He 's able to go up with a receiver and fight all the way to the ground . " <p> Turf tests <p> Big receivers , likw Dallas ' Michael Irvin and Washington 's Michael Westbrook , surely will offer tests tonight , regardless of status , reputations and Pro Bowl appearances . Certainly , the outstanding cornerback tandems are braced . <p> Two weeks ago , the Redskins beat Jacksonville 24-12 as Green and Dishman neutralized two 1,000-yard receivers , Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell . <p> " But just like we shut them down , we ended up giving up over 250 yards to Ty Detmer , " Dishman says of last week 's 24-10 loss at Philadelphia . " How do you figure that ? You 've got to prove yourself every week . " <p> Much can be proved tonight under a national spotlight , with intriguing subplots galore and the NFC East lead at stake . <p> And maybe Pro Bowl votes can be earned , too . <p> Says Dishman : " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro Bowl cornerback slots . But we do n't have to be the best tandem as long as we reach our ultimate goal . " <p> LOTT 'S DYNAMIC DUOS <p> Former all-pro safety Ronnie Lott , a studio analyst for Fox Sports , was asked by USA TODAY to rank the NFL 's five best current cornerback tandems . Lott , considered a lock for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame , earned four Super Bowl rings as a member of the San Francisco 49ers and was named to 10 Pro Bowls during a 15-year career . His picks : <p>  --  Deion Sanders and Kevin Smith , Dallas Cowboys  --  " Deion is the best . What makes Deion special is an ability to recover when he 's been beat . He gets back to the ball . He 's a lot like Lester Hayes in that regard . Another thing I like about Deion : When the ball 's in the air , he goes after it like a receiver . Kevin Smith is solid , too . Very physical . He gets after receivers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best attribute . " <p>  --  Dale Carter and James Hasty , Kansas City Chiefs  --  " It 's really a tossup between Carter-Hasty and Sanders-Smith as the absolute best tandem . I 'd say they are the top two tandems . Athletically , Dale Carter is right there with Deion , and he 's very physical . Of this whole group , James Hasty is the most underrated . He 's very consistent . . . a strong tackler who will hit you . He may be the game 's most complete cornerback . " <p>  --  Darrell Green and Cris Dishman , Washington Redskins  --  " Darrell has great speed and uses it to run guys down . Plus , he loves playing the game and even now still looks for ways to improve . Dishman is in the same class as Kevin Smith when it comes to being very physical . They do n't want footraces , but they like beating receivers up and getting them out of their game . " <p>  --  Terry McDaniel and Albert Lewis , Oakland Raiders  --  " The Raiders have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luxury of that option with these guys . They are still formidable . As you get older as a DB , you get smarter in knowing how to take better angles to cut off receivers ; you understand quarterbacks better and how to use the other players on the defense in your coverage . They are good examples of this . " <p>  --  Troy Vincent and Bobby Taylor , Philadelphia Eagles  --  " They like to get after you . Troy has gotten better because he 's tougher now . He 'll get up and challenge a receiver . Bobby is one of the young guns . He has those long arms you love to see on a cornerback . He 's not as strong as Mel Blount was , but he has that Blount-Eric Wright body . And Ray Rhodes tells me that when they get beat , they come right back and keep challenging people . "
