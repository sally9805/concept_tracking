I stood in the Robert Bly book-autographing line and handed Bly a copy of Iron John , asking him to sign it " for Walter " ( it was my father 's book ) . Bly studied me for a moment over the rim of his glasses , wild white hair flying out from either side , and then scribbled something . On my way out I peeked inside the cover . Bly had drawn two fish swimming to the right , a moose headed left , and topped it off with an inscription , " For Wal-Tor . " Invoking the thunder god ? I felt I 'd gotten my money 's worth . Unlike some of my feminist friends I 've never been a Bly-basher . Feminism has taught me new ways of understanding myself and history , and I welcome the chance for men to have a similar opportunity . Bly seeks to reenergize men through a model of masculinity that is neither " Dow Jones " macho nor New Age " soft . " I was eager to see how Bly planned to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary . It was clear from the start that Bly is an entertainer , a storyteller . Ruddy-faced and colorfully vested , he strode up the aisle of the crowded chapel with an instrument tucked under one arm . He perched on a stool like a folk singer and began strumming chords and reciting his poetry and lines from a medieval prayer . This was billed , loosely , as " An Evening with Robert Bly . " ( I was n't quite sure when to start taking notes . ) Bly fleetingly reminded me of Garrison Keillor : two Lutheran storytellers from small-town Minnesota who use music , farm life , the church and ordinary folk to tell their stories . The comparison ends there , however . Bly lacks Keillor 's patience with the church and his breadth of interests . It was also clear that Bly is primarily a poet , not the leader of an intellectual movement . Bly has written eight volumes of poetry and only one Iron John . He speaks and writes in images , dropping nuggets of wisdom . His remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , male mentors and grief  --  clippings from his books . He paused often to read his poetry , quote statistics about men , gaze into the distance and sigh , and offer political commentary such as , " Americans have so much father hunger , grandfather hunger , that even though Reagan was a fake actor , we hired him anyway . " In performance , many of these nuggets seem profound . They are less convincing in written form . For example , Iron John contains gems like this : " Because animals exhibit hair in profusion and because we see our own sexuality as animal , the linkage is unavoidable . A man 's moustache may stand for his pubic hair . " The poems Bly recited were mostly about the grief caused by his father 's emotional distance . He presented the poems as teaching tools , much as he used the fairy tale " Iron John " in his book . After every poem he stopped and asked , " Is that clear ? " Bly 's lament for his father 's ineptitude  --  " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am my father 's son "  --  is meant to stimulate self-recognition in his listeners and a free flowing of grief or anger . ( This process is a close as Bly got to an actual program for healing men 's wounds . ) Bly encourages men not just to bemoan but to redeem their fathers ' memories . In a poem about his father 's funeral Bly describes seeing a " young hawk " as well as an " old hawk " in the wasted body . While the old hawk " cleaned his Bly 's bones more than once , " Bly sees the young hawk as one who will guide his father " to the Lord of Night who will give you the tenderness you wanted here . " If your father was not too badly wounded ( and Bly says all men over 35 are wounded ) . Bly 's poetry may not grab you . One man told me that he could n't understand Bly 's poems and that he 'd much rather read Robert Frost or Maya Angelou or Langston Hughes . Most men present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Bly the poet . They had specific questions for him , usually couched in the guru 's terms . " How can men recapture their nondestructive warrior energy ? " seemed basic to Bly 's agenda . Yet faced with such a question Bly looked bored and replied , " Well , what do you think ? " If Bly the storyteller and poet has become Bly the leader of a men 's movement , it is mostly by default and thanks to Bill Moyers 's 1990 PBS special . I 'm not sure what " healing " this audience was able to receive from Bly , who got his start in the business of men 's wounds when , in leading workshops for both men and women , he discovered that the men had never been " talked to " by older men . Lacking such mentors , they lacked direction and a genuine sense of masculinity  --  a sense of how to be both emotional yet passionate , fierce but nonaggressive . These men had what Bly calls in Iron John a " hole in their psyches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he needs someone else to derive a nuts-and-bolts agenda from his images . Who can really argue with his general concerns  --  that men need time out for reflection so that they can more fully re-enter family life ; that they need to find alternatives to violence ; that they must become articulate beyond John Wayne 's " Yup " and " Nope " ; that they must learn " inner struggle " now that they 've mastered struggle in " blizzards and deserts " ? One impediment to going further with these concerns is Bly 's reliance on fairy tales ( he says he prefers fairy tales because Jungians and Freudians have pretty much left them alone ) . " The hearth and fairy stories have passed as water through 50 feet of soil , " Bly writes , " through generations of men and women , and we can trust their images . " But fairy tales are like unmoored images . They may float around in our consciousness , but they are n't grounded in historical reality or embedded in our cultural tradition the way that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is interesting to read about the young boy in " Iron John " who knows when to be modest and cover his golden hair , Christians have a rich ethical tradition to guide their behavior , and such texts as the one about the tax collector in the temple who knows how to pray humbly . Biblical stories are time-tested , and are deeply rooted in our culture . And they also offer plenty of examples of father-son relationships , good and bad . Another problem with Bly 's approach is that it seems to encourage self-absorption . This tendency has alarmed some feminists , who claim that whenever men are absorbed with nurturing their individual power , both men and women are going to suffer . To move beyond narcissism , the men 's movement needs to be grounded in a commitment to a community . The church , ideally , can be that community which , without denying individual needs , urges people to look beyond their wounds to those of their neighbors . The church can also remind us of our individual and collective sinfulness and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sinned against . Bly argues that the church is neglecting that duty . It tells us to boycott grapes , but it no longer tells us to repent . Church and seminary have become too cheerful for Bly 's taste . At the same time he maintains that the church has wrongly suppressed male sexual energy and spontaneity-represented by the hairy Wild Man in " Iron John . " But there seems to be a contradiction here . Does Bly mean for the church to instill a greater sense of repentance while at the same time allowing men to express their Wild Man energy more freely ? Contradictory elements such as these may work well in poetry , but they do n't make for a coherent movement . Bly 's central concern seems to be to recover male passion and energy , linked symbolically and mythically to hair . In " Iron John " the Wild Man is " a large man covered with hair from head to foot , " lying on the bottom of a pond . This hairy man  --  Bly says he 's more a woodsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisiveness . " Bly accuses the corporate world of producing " sanitized , hairless , shallow " men and he asks men to descend into the male psyche and welcome the " deep male , " the " nourishing dark , " the " Hairy Man . " Hairiness represents " wildness , irrationality ... intuition , emotion , the body , and nature . " This new man is not the long-haired ' ' 60s hippie ( too soft ) , nor is he a violent creature who seeks to inflict harm . Perhaps Bly can not be much more specific because not many men have embodied this third model of masculinity recently . He notes that the church and culture as a whole dropped those hairy gods and figures who represented male energy , sexual and otherwise , such as Pan , Dionysus , Hermes , the Wild Man , Shiva , and Enkidu in the epic Gilgamesh . We even rejected hairy Esau . " The ethical superstructure of popular Christianity does not support the Wild Man , " Bly writes , " though there is some suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry , a hairy John , after all , baptized him . " Bly refers later to a " hairy Magdalene . " Actually , there are plenty of hairy Johns and hairy Magdalenes in the Bible  --  not Wild Man equivalents , but prophets who have passion for justice , mercy and holiness . These voices crying in the wilderness sought to criticize and change society from the margins . ( Unlike the Wild Man , however , who listens for his inner voice , the prophets ' lips were sealed so that they could hear and then speak only the word of God . ) The biblical tradition itself , then , offers ample material for a self-critique , as well as a warrant for a " hairy " passion . Bly rightly reminds us that we need more teachers and mentors , people of passionate beliefs . In claiming that sexuality has suffered from " the trimmed , the sleek " and " the tyranny of the bald , ascetic and cerebral , " he affirms folklorist Marie-Louise von Franz , who believes that we need a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with God and sexuality , with spirit and earth . " Perhaps , as a response , Christians could heed more closely the " hairy " within their own tradition . <p>
