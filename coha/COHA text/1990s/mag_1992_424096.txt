These early-blooming perennials boast exquisite flowers and attractive foliage <p> Some say that one of the first signs of becoming a serious gardener is a growing interest in hellebores  --  sumptuous perennials that bloom during the bleakest months of the year . Their nodding , open , cup-shaped flowers are large in comparison to the usually modest blooms of winter ( usually two to three inches in diameter ) and they come in a ravishing array of colors . White , primrose , emerald , chartreuse , palest pink , crimson , maroon , dusky purple to almost blue-black  --  the hellebore family contains countless alluring shades , some so subtle you can hardly put a name to them . In addition to their beautiful flowers , hellebores boast handsome , bold , divided leaves that are evergreen in many varieties . Indeed , in the case of Helleborus argutifolius , H. lividus , and H. foetidus , their sculptured mounds of foliage alone warrant their inclusion among the very best architectural plants . <p> Yet another bonus is that , unlike snowdrops , crocuses , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season of bloom : From the moment their buds first show color early in the year , they gradually increase in beauty until at last the flowers are fully open . And for many long weeks , almost until spring turns into summer , the fertilized flowers remain on the plants , slowly ripening their seed , their now muted tones mingling with the fresh , bright colors of later-blooming plants . <p> If you thought that hellebores would not flourish in your climate , you need n't worry . They are as happy in Georgia or Maine as they are in my garden in Dublin , where the climate is similar to that of Seattle , but with less sunshine . Almost all the species are hardy to at least USDA Zone 6 , and some of the loveliest  --  including Helleborus niger , H. orientalis , and H. foetidus  --  will endure Zone 4 winters . Although all hellebores flower early in the year , the plants adapt their flowering times to local temperatures . In the Deep South , for example , it is not unusual to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 garden in the North may have to wait until April . Long-lived , easy to grow , and not particular about soil provided they are well fed and not allowed to become too dry , these are plants for every sort of gardener , asking only protection from the harshest sun . And because they are happiest in the dappled shade of deciduous trees and shrubs , they are ideal candidates for the woodland garden . <p> The most widely encountered hellebores are the so-called orientalis hybrids , more correctly known as H. xhybridus , because they are descended not only from the Lenten rose ( H. orientalisMDRV ) but also from other species such as H. cyclophyllus and H. torquatus , which have added greens , pale yellows , and purples to the Lenten rose 's basic white . I well remember the time I first saw one of these hybrids : It was approaching dusk on a blustery March evening in Northern Ireland . In a small grove of silver birches , where the setting sun lit up the white trunks , were some hellebores of great quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their owner kindly gave me one , and from that moment on I found hellebores impossible to resist . <p> The orientalis hybrids not only have the widest color range of all the hellebores , their beautiful blossoms are often spotted inside . These markings can range from a faint speckling to a heavy mottling , which only adds to their slightly sinister , brooding charm . The foliage is almost as handsome as the flowers themselves : The dark , glossy , divided evergreen leaves form an imposing clump about 18 inches high and two feet across . In the North , the foliage can look rather bedraggled at the end of a harsh winter ; in such cases it is advisable to remove the leaves so that they do not spoil the floral display . A flush of new growth will quickly follow . <p> If you succumb to hellebore mania , you may wish to grow some of the species that have contributed their rich colors to the orientalis hybrids . Many years ago I caught sight of Helleborus torquatus in a Scottish garden . The color was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigeon , a sort of dove-gray with a faint pink flush . It was 15 tantalizing years before I was given a piece of the plant , which unfortunately seems to have been weakened by years of vegetative propagation . The extraordinary color of the flowers , however , has prompted me to encourage it with side dressings of dried blood . Plants raised from seed will be much more vigorous , although the flowers ' color will vary considerably . In its native Yugoslavia , H. torquatus can range from a deep black-purple through a clear green , with any number of intermediate shades . ( The darkest-flowered forms have produced amazing hybrids , such as the blue-black Philip Ballard ' , raised by Helen Ballard at her nursery near Malvern , England , and named after her husband . No photograph can do justice to the color : You will have to imagine a piece of very dark , wet slate in evening light . ) One of the most enticing variants is illustrated in Brian Mathew 's excellent book Hellebores see " For Further Reading , " page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has petals that are velvet-black on the outside and luminous green inside , deliciously veined in darkest maroon . In other respects H. torquatus resembles the orientalis hybrids , although the foliage is not evergreen and can sometimes be more finely divided . <p> Another attractive orientalis type is the plant that has been known for years as Helleborus atrorubens of gardens . ( In reality , according to Brian Mathew , it is a particularly dark clone of H. orientalis subspecies abchasicus , but it is invariably listed as H. atrorubens in catalogs . ) The large flowers are a rich purple with green overtones , and again the deciduous foliage is similar to that of the orientalis hybrids . This plant is one of the first hellebores to flower , and in mild areas can generally be relied upon to bloom in January . <p> Helleborus orientalis and its allies are not the only hellebores worth growing , however . Almost as well known , and certainly as beloved , is the Christmas rose ( H. niger ) . Contrary to its name , the plant rarely blooms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get an early-flowering form is to take a mid-winter tour of your friends ' gardens with a bucket and spade . If by chance you are lucky enough to have one , it is a good idea to cover the plant with a cloche to keep the flowers from being splattered with winter rain and mud . ) Regardless of when it blooms , H. niger is a most beautiful plant . The nodding white flowers , which may have a lovely pink glow on the backs of the petals , sport a boss of golden stamens and are usually borne above one-foot clumps of evergreen foliage . Some gardeners find H. niger difficult to establish . The best solution is to give the plant a limy , retentive soil along with regular spring feedings of old manure and leafmold . Also , a fungus that causes a black spotting of the leaves may be a problem in mild-winter climates . Regular spraying with a fungicide may help , but the spotting is n't always easy to eliminate . <p> The Lenten roses and related species are members of the acaulescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basal leaves and leafless flower stems . A number of species , however , have semiwoody stems that persist through the winter and that bear flowers along with the leaves ; the stems die after flowering and are replaced by offsets . These plants are known as the caulescent hellebores , and although they bear exceedingly handsome flowers , they are grown primarily for their foliage . <p> The Corsican hellebore ( H. argutifolius ; formerly known as H. corsicus ) is an architectural plant with an almost shrublike presence . The pale-green three-foot stems are in perfect accord with the luminous cup-shaped flowers , the color of lime ice with lemon stamens and emerald nectaries . The blossoms , in turn , are set off by darker green , sharply-toothed , stiff , leathery leaves  --  the whole making a striking decorative mound . Given its Mediterranean origins , it likes a bit more sun than most and is slightly less hardy . ( It can survive a Zone 6 winter with protection , although the flower buds may be killed . ) <p> The closely related Helleborus lividus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majorca . It is smaller than H. argutifolius ( it reaches only 18 inches ) and the gray-green leaves are marbled with silver . The flowers and the backs of the leaves are usually stained with purple . Unfortunately , it is hardy only to Zone 8 , but it can be successfully grown in a cool greenhouse . If it is planted outside anywhere near H. argutifolius you will get masses of hybrids known as H. xsternii , which vary enormously between the two parents . The best forms , such as Boughton Beauty ' , raised by the English plantswoman Valerie Finnis , make a decorative mound of gray-green foliage throughout the year . The flowers have a lovely pinkish flush inherited from H. lividus . <p> A plant that merits much wider use is Helleborus foetidus , which has been saddled with the unfortunate common name of stinking hellebore . Actually , the plant gives off no odor unless the leaves are bruised , and even then the scent is n't all that bad . Among its many virtues are its clusters of palest green bells , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dark green , deeply divided leaves , which grow to about 18 inches . An obliging workhorse of a plant , it will grow in the most inhospitably dry , shady places and can light up many a drab corner early in the year . The Wester Flisk ' strain is particularly desirable , with leaves that are a glaucous lead-gray , and flower stalks prettily washed with crimson . If kept apart from other forms of H. foetidus it will come reasonably true from seed . <p> Hellebores are among the greedier plants we can grow . Whenever I plant any of the orientalis hybrids or H. niger I dig in at least two buckets of fresh topsoil mixed with old manure or compost , leafmold , and bonemeal . Any plants that are not fattening as fast as I would like get side dressings of dried blood and liquid manure in the summer . To prevent the spread of fungal disease I cut off the old leaves in late autumn and spray the plants regularly with fungicide every few weeks . ( These precautions are seldom necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spread of fungus . ) H. argutifolius , H. lividus , and H. foetidus do not need as rich a diet , and because they are caulescent , and you should never cut off their leaves  --  there 'd be nothing left of the plant . However , the old spent flowering stems may be cut off when they begin to yellow in summer . Aphids are the one insect pest that can be a problem with hellebores , and if they remain unchecked the young leaves can become distorted . Applications of insecticidal soap , repeated if necessary , will keep them under control . <p> Like many other herbaceous plants , the orientalis hybrids and H. niger eventually wear out the soil and tie their roots into such a knot that they greatly benefit from division . I used to believe that the larger the piece of hellebore one moved the better . Not so . Small pieces are healthier and reestablish more quickly . If they are cut up just as the leaves start to grow ( February in my garden ) , they seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 1732 Philip Miller remarked in The Gardeners Dictionary that hellebores " are propagated either from Seeds , or by parting of their Roots : The best season for this work is in February when you may divide the Roots into small heads .... " Because the rootstock forms a tangled woody mass , the job is best done with a sharp kitchen knife and a bucket of water to wash off the soil . <p> While propagating hellebores poses no great difficulty , it is not easy to obtain plants with superior flowers , particularly when it comes to the orientalis hybrids . In the absence of nurseries that will sell hybrids by color , the best recourse is to raise them from seed . ( See " Raising Hellebores from Seed , " page 00 . Happily , from a dark plum-colored hybrid you will usually get some good dark-plum seedlings ; a pink-spotted plant will produce pink-spotted progeny , and so on . Thus , if you start off with a fine seed strain , you are already halfway there . ( You should bear in mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will almost always produce freckled children . ) <p> However fascinating hellebores may be in themselves , it is unlikely that they can make for a satisfying all-season border without the addition of some suitable companion plants . The small pure-white , four-petaled flowers and shiny bright-green leaves of Pachyphragma macrophylla , a not-often-seen member of the cabbage family , associate particularly well with dark-purple hellebores , which need something to brighten them up . Two other ideal plants from the same family are Cardamine heptaphylla ( formerly Dentaria pinnata ) and C. pentaphyllos ( formerly D. digitata ) , both easy , early-flowering perennials with fresh-green divided leaves and white and lilac-pink flowers respectively . A patch of Primula vulgaris subspecies sibthorpii , a pale-lavender primrose , or Primula Easter Bonnet ' , a pink double primrose with an excellent constitution , would look lovely with the dark slatey hellebores . Pink Corydalis solida , Chionodoxa siehei Pink Giant ' , and Erythronium revolutum nearby could complete the picture . <p> If pinks are n't to your liking , blue scillas , blue primroses , and blue pulmonarias are equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulmonarias , or lungworts , seem specially designed as companion plants for hellebores  --  they like the same shady growing conditions and many flower at the same time . Pulmonaria officinalis , with its spotted leaves and blue flowers , is a pleasant , old-fashioned thing , but there are many good cultivars such as Roy Davidson ' ( sky-blue with pink buds ) and Blue Mist ' ( pale blue ) , to name but two . Pulmonaria longifolia Bertram Anderson ' has the same silver-patterned foliage but its flowers are a darker blue . Other choices are early-flowering daffodils and snowdrops , the latter of which contribute glaucous foliage that is handsome against bare earth . For later in the year one should think of plants with good contrasting foliage  --  ferns , epimediums , hostas , and bergenias , for example . Self-seeders such as foxgloves , white musk mallow ( Malva moschata Alba ' ) , double white feverfew ( Tanacetum parthenium White Bonnet ' ) , or peach-leaved bellflower ( Campanula persicifolia ) will add welcome touches of color here and there . <p> What kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It is probable that the trend toward pure , clean colors  --  either with or without spots  --  will continue . And double hellebores , which used to be just a daydream , may become increasingly available . Several double-flowered clones are already circulating in the United Kingdom , and about 40 percent of their seedlings retain the desired double trait . The star of my double hellebores is an exceedingly pretty plant that originated in Germany . It is pinkish-green and very spotty indeed ; if you did n't know it was a hellebore , you might think it was some kind of beautiful winter-blooming waterlily that had somehow found its way onto dry land . Perhaps the most tantalizing new hellebores are the picotee hybrids now being bred in England : Imagine a white-flowered hellebore with each petal delicately edged in purple . With all of their virtues of flower and leaf , it is only a matter of time before hellebores assume their rightful place among the first rank of herbaceous perennials . <p> For Further Reading <p> The best book on hellebores currently available is Hellebores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden Society , 1989 ; available from Mr. D.

With chapters on natural history , classification , culture , propagation , and hybridization , as well as every known species , it is an indispensable resource . Enthusiasts will also want to keep an eye out for a new work on the genus by Elizabeth Strangman , noted British nurserywoman and raiser of hellebores , and Graham Rice , to be published in this country by Timber Press in 1993 or 1994 . <p> Helen Dillon 's garden was featured in the December 1990 issue of Horticulture . <p> TABLE <p> PHOTO : This gathering of orientalis hybrids highlights their seductive subtlety of color and form .

( LAMONTAGNE ) <p> <p> By Helen Dillon <p> GROWING HELLEBORES FROM SEED <p> Although the better-known hellebore species are usually available from mail-order nurseries , the more unusual species , along with orientalis hybrids selected by color , are not . For the gardener who wishes to grow these scarce but desirable plants , the best recourse is to raise them from seed . ( See " Sources , " for a listing of nurseries and seed companies that offer a wide assortment of species and hybrid seed . ) <p> Hellebores belong to the buttercup family , or Ranunculaceae , and like many members of that family , their seed contains chemical inhibitors that must be broken down by alternating periods of warmth and cold before germination will occur . The traditional method of raising the plants is to sow fresh seed in a freely draining soil-based potting mixture , and then simply to leave the pots outdoors for the winter , making sure that they never become completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin layer of grit over each pot to prevent the growth of algae and liverworts . ) When the seedlings appear in early spring they can go into a cold frame or into individual pots , and by early autumn will usually be large enough to be planted out . <p> A somewhat more reliable method was discovered by Dr. Norman C. Deno and reported in his book Seed Germination Theory and Practice . ( See a review in the June/July issue of Horticulture , page 85 . ) Dr. Deno found that good germination could be obtained by sowing fresh seed and keeping the pots at 70 degrees Fahrenheit for three months . The pots must then be moved to 40 degrees for another two to three months ( a refrigerator works well ) , after which germination is rapid . ( Once the seeds have sprouted , the seedlings no longer need to be chilled and should be treated like any other perennial . ) <p> David Culp , president of the Mid-Atlantic chapter of the Hardy Plant Society , favors yet another technique .
