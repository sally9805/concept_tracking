I was on the front porch , drinking espresso and watching birds squabble at the feeder . It was late autumn ; the apple and cherry trees had dutifully dropped their leaves and stood naked beside the evergreens . Otherwise , the only way to tell the closeness of winter on my two acres of California was by the incredible fruitfulness of the garden . I looked forward to the first good frost , which would relieve me of the need to go out every day and find homes for tomatoes and zucchini with friends who already had too many of their own . Compared to that , giving away the last litter of kittens had been a snap . I 've considered imitating a desperate friend , who abandons baskets of produce on the doorsteps of strangers . <p> A limousine pulled up to the gate . One of those rented jobs , a chauffeur in front . Two biker goons got out . Leather and chain berserkers in a stretch Cadillac . Probably lost and needing directions to one of the illegal dope farms for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slim , dissipated , a light Italian suit with no shirt . Long hair limp and dirty . Evan something or other . I recognized him from channel surfing past MTV . He was evidently big with Beavis and Butt-Head . <p> He slipped inside the gate and walked up to the house . The dogs paced beside him , neither friendly nor unfriendly , like cops at a peaceful demonstration . <p> He stopped and looked up at me . " Hello . You 're Arwen Wildflower ? " <p> Okay , the name seemed cool when I was a sixteen-year-old runaway with flowers in my hair . And now I 'm stuck with it . <p> " The former Shirley O'Malley ? " <p> I had n't heard that name since 1969 . A little knot of paranoia began to form somewhere under my cotton and lace peasant shirt . " Maybe . What 's it to you ? " <p> The rock star tried to smile with a face accustomed to leers and smirks . His face got sort of crooked and he showed bad teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Shit . It 's not like I 'd been spending the last quarter century anticipating this Hallmark Moment . <p> I stood up and pointed into the house . " Want some espresso ? " <p> My cat loves her babies ; I once saw her attack a Doberman who got too dose . The Doberman lost . But once the kittens hit puberty she wo n't have a thing to do with them , even chases them away . And she seems , in general , to be a better morn than my German shepherd , my quarter horse , my cow . <p> And then there 's the birds . They 'll die defending their nest  --  but if a baby falls out and lies there chirping , they just sit there and watch it die . <p> Motherhood . Donna Reed and Harriet Nelson and Jane Anderson tried to convince me it was the only reason I existed . Get born , grow up , get pregnant , have babies , raise them , have grandchildren , die . The last three thousand years of philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my future was meant to be as uncomplicated as a brood mare 's . <p> Maybe if everything had gone as planned I 'd still be in Ohio , married , housewife , two sons in college , two daughters starting their own families . More likely I 'd be divorced , trying to raise all those kids on minimum wage and minuscule child support , while my ex-husband the dentist drove his new wife around in a Lotus sport . <p> In fact , I bet Donna Reed 's doctor divorced her for a trophy wife , and Harriet 's raising grandchildren on her Social Security check , and Jane 's in a nursing home that her kids never visit . <p> The rock star sat at my kitchen table and briefly fooled with one of the dulcimers I build . He had musical talent  --  not that you could tell from his videos . <p> " You need something , " I said . <p> " A guy ca n't wonder about his real mother ? " <p> I shrugged . " You 're twenty-five and look forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tattoos you have to be very drunk to hold still for ... You do n't strike me as the sentimental kind . " <p> He grinned . " Right . You dropped me like a dog taking a dump and ran . My adoptive family raised me to be a little Republican ' til I was old enough to smoke and drink and screw around , and then they ditched me too . ... I do n't need anyone . " <p> Like I said , a real Hallmark Moment . <p> " So what is it , bone marrow ? " <p> " Close . How 'd you like fifty grand ? " <p> Well hell . How 'd I like to pay off the mortgage and the back debts ? Selling homemade berry jam and dulcimers , and playing flute in classy restaurants for tips is n't exactly financial security . <p> " What for ? " <p> " Something you are n't using . Your eggs . " <p> Sometimes  --  not often  --  I 'd lie there in the night and wonder how my kid had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own . That was n't one of the options you had in 1969 . <p> Besides , I never liked kids . I hated baby-sitting , hated being at the kids ' table at holiday dinners , did n't even think babies were cute . They were smelly and formless and boring . Until they got big enough to be smelly and unintelligible and demanding . Even now when some friend 's two-year-old starts talking to me , I nod and fix a smile on my face and pray someone will rescue me . <p> Maybe if I 'd met Mr. Right and lived a normal middle-class life I 'd have eventually wanted to reproduce , and maybe I 'd have wound up loving my kids the same way I get attached to stray cats . But I suspect I would have been a lousy more , abusive or at best neglectful . Strung out on whatever prescription tranquilizer was au courant . Building job security for my kids ' future psychotherapists . <p> When I wondered about my kid , I figured he 'd have musical talent , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start thinking there was more to life than money and status and predictability . <p> Only when I discovered music in the Sixties it came with a philosophical background of love and peace . When Evan 's time rolled around it was just sex ' n ' drugs ' n ' rock ' n ' roll . Live fast , die young , leave a burned-out body . <p> At twenty-five , when most kids from his background were finishing law or medical school , starting a career and a family , he 'd somehow managed to get such bad alcoholic pancreatitis that now he was diabetic and dying . A real overachiever . <p> " I do n't do well with insulin , " he said . The groupies and the drugs tended to interfere with a regular diet and medication regimen . So it was in and out of hospitals with the various forms of diabetic coma . <p> " The docs say I have a year to live , maybe less . Maybe more if I clean up my act . " He snorted derisively . Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look sympathetic . I 've seen friends lose children ; it seems like the worst thing that can happen . They never recover . Years later they 're still haunted and bitter . It makes you wonder how people ever survived , back when half your kids routinely died . <p> Yet here my own son had just told me his death sentence , and it affected me no more than the news of the latest flood in Bangladesh : too bad , what 's for dinner ? He was a stranger to me . <p> " My only hope , " he continued , " is a pancreas transplant . " <p> " Well , go for it . " <p> " It 's not feasible , " he said . " See , you have to at least pretend to clean up your act , something I 'm no good at . Then you have to wait for someone right to die , and you take all these immunosuppressive drugs that make life unpleasant . " <p> " Okay , so is this some **28;1146;TOOLONG trip ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got too much money to die . I 'm going for the best transplant  --  from my own body . From a clone . " <p> He 'd brought a video with his pet scientists giving the pitch . While I watched , he prowled around the house looking at pictures , noodling on my guitar , hassling the pets . I 'd have been nervous if I 'd had anything worth stealing . <p> I 'd never thought about clones . I 'd seen enough Star Trek to figure you just took any old cell from the human body  --  even hair or skin or blood , which it turns out do n't even have enough DNA to work with  --  and grow one . <p> But it seems that only germ cells  --  eggs and sperm  --  have the appropriate DNA . Chromosomes are modified with methylation so the DNA of each cell line turns on in a specific way . That way liver cells ca n't grow into spleen cells , let alone become a baby . <p> To make matters more confused , even the chromosomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something called genetic imprinting , meaning that you need both male and female contribution for the baby to turn out right . In illustration , the scientist went on and on about what happens when someone gets a wrong set of chromosome 14 . If both come from Mom  --  it 's called uniparental disomy , in the unlikely event anyone cares  --  the kid gets Prader Willi and he 's retarded and fat . If both chromosomes come from Dad , then the kid has Angelman 's syndrome , retarded and autistic . <p> The whole thing was incredibly complex , and since my tenth grade bio was back in the dark ages I was lost . <p> I understood the bottom line , though . They needed my germ cell chromosomes to build a copy of Evan . <p> They 'd give me a drug to make a bunch of eggs mature simultaneously , then harvest them laparascopically  --  Band-aid surgery . Then they 'd separate out the chromosomes they needed  --  the explanation for that was so technical I zoned out completely  --  and then add the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Whoa , more than Oedipal , " I remarked to the video . <p> They 'd implant the fertilized egg in a host mother and let it grow . Just before six months they 'd do a hysterectomy/abortion , dissect out the pancreas , and transplant the tiny islets of Langerhans into Evan , curing his diabetes . His own cells  --  a perfect match . He would n't need any immune suppressants . <p> " Two things , " I told him after I 'd stared at the blank TV a while . " You can have the eggs . I 'm not exactly using them . But I also want to be the host . " I could use a hysterectomy . Menstruation has always struck me as a sexist God 's punishment for lack of reproduction , and I was sick and tired of it . " Package deal , half a million bucks . " <p> We haggled a couple hours , settled on a quarter million , and called the lawyers . <p> Two months later I was pregnant . Deja vu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . <p> " You ca n't be ! " We were whispering in the school rest room . She 'd been puking , and I was supposed to be helping her get to the school nurse . " I mean , you ca n't get pregnant if you have n't ... " <p> " I have . " <p> " Wow . " That stopped me . Back then , no one did . <p> " My folks 'll kill me . " <p> I did n't doubt it . <p> The father was one of the hippie poets in our class . He was terrified . Knocking someone up was grounds for reform school . For the girl it was a shotgun marriage , or an extended trip to some fictional relative out of state . In any event , you were grounded for the rest of your life . <p> Good girls did n't have sex . Everyone knew that . So if you did , and people found out , you were doomed . You 'd never get a job or married . No decent person  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . You 'd wind up a hooker in a seaport town , and die of degradation or booze . No second chances . Absolute ruin . <p> The hippie poet got some money and found a guy who 'd " take care of it . " I borrowed the car , said we were going to the football game , and drove to the sleazy side of town . The father was too chicken to come along . He said he had to meditate . <p> Nowadays when you think of abortions , you think of a nice clean clinic with doctors , nurses , anesthesia , and assholes picketing outside . Back then abortions were in someone 's kitchen , so dirty you would have refused to eat there let alone have surgery , and a guy with thick glasses and poor personal hygiene who claimed he knew how to do it . You did n't ask for credentials . <p> Mary got up on the table and spread her legs . She was crying . <p> " Shut up , " he said offhandedly . " Hold her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very shiny , and a few surgical tools that he wiped off with rubbing alcohol . Mary screamed . <p> " If you do that again , I 'll stop . " She screamed again . <p> " Shut up , stupid bitch , " he remarked . I was feeling pretty sick myself , and my hands hurt from where Mary was squeezing them . I gave her a rolled up handkerchief to bite . <p> All in all , it was n't much more sophisticated than a coat hanger . " You 'll bleed for a few days , " he said . " Tell anyone and I 'll kill you . " <p> " You have a lousy bedside manner , " I told him as we left . That struck him as funny . I heard him laughing halfway down the stairs . <p> Mary bled all over the front seat . Try explaining that to your parents . <p> THE WORST BIT about being pregnant is the morning sickness . That sudden queasy feeling and , if you 're lucky , a successful sprint for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive and get sicker at the thought of food . <p> That was how I knew I was pregnant last time . I knew this time when I woke up puking . <p> I called the mad doctor in charge of the program . Frankie , I called him ; he looked a little like a grown-up Frankie Avalon playing Dr. Frankenstein . <p> " I think I 've got morning sickness . " <p> " Great ! " <p> " Easy for you to say . " <p> " No , this means it took . You 're pregnant . " <p> " Look , just get me some phenergan or something . " <p> " No , nothing that could cause birth defects . " <p> " Who cares about that stuff ? So it can screw up the heart or make the kid retarded  --  it 's not like that matters . I want something for nausea ! " <p> " No drugs . You 're pregnant , remember ? " <p> At that point I dropped the phone and ran for the sink . Frankie waited on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long distance and I was paying . <p> I 'd been playing guitar when Mary came over . I could play the folkie stuff , as long as none of it was anti-war , while my parents were home , but I had to save protest or hard-line rock for when they were out playing bridge . <p> " You do n't look good . " <p> " I 'm sick , " she moaned . She was hot to the touch , and she felt clammy and smelled bad . <p> " I 'm still bleeding . " <p> " He said you 'd do that for a while . " <p> " Yeah , but it 's black and kind of stringy . " <p> " Yuck . ... Maybe something 's gone , you know , wrong . We could go to the hospital . " <p> " No ! They 'd find out . ... I 'll be okay . I just need to sleep , okay ? Play some Dylan . " <p> So I played " The Times They Are a Changing , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our parents did n't know what we were up to , and " Subterranean Homesick Blues . " She seemed to be asleep and then she had a seizure . I called the ambulance , but it was all over when they got there . <p> The cops grilled me , but I denied knowing anything . I got grounded for a month , anyway . I felt guilty , too . A couple years ago I told my doctor about it . " What if I 'd made her go to the hospital , instead of waiting ? " <p> " She 'd have died anyway . Do n't let it bother you . " <p> Like you can let it not bother you , watching your best friend die on your bed from a botched abortion . Doctors are like that . <p> ROCK STAR CLONED ! NATURAL MOTHER CARRIES TINY METAL MAN . <p> The last people you 'd expect to break a real story ... I found out at the supermarket checkout stand , where I was loading up on Seven-up and soda crackers . It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my entire sleazy life story . No onus involved in getting pregnant when I was sixteen . No , now I was to be pilloried for not raising the kid . Plus ca change , plus c ' est le meme chose . <p> " How did it feel to give up your baby at birth ? " <p> " I du n no , how did it feel to give up your journalistic integrity ? " <p> A roadie had broke the story for ten grand . Evan 's bikers broke him . Then Evan sent one of his toughs to keep reporters away from me . It was a real sweet gesture . <p> The hiker 's name was Tony . He was my age and on the wagon due to a mild case of cirrhosis and a moderate case of chronic bronchitis . Bikers have an early expiration date . Tony had a degree in philosophy from a midwest aggie college , had learned to smoke and drink and shoot up in Nam , and had detoxed during his last stay in jail . His goal , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real old Harley . <p> He had a lot of interesting tattoos . We got friendly , and he showed them all to me . <p> I used to hang out at the record store and listen to all the flew stuff as it came in . I loved the Doors , Hendrix , the psychedelics . There was this college guy working there that summer , and he liked the same groups I did . <p> One day I was in the booth listening to the new Cream when he told me he had a bootleg Dylan tape . Wow ! It was illegal , but I could come over to his pad and listen . . . . <p> This was still the Sixties . Girls did n't go to a guy 's place to hear music . Guys then thought , you know , that if you came to their room it meant you were going to sleep with them . <p> They thought that if you said , yeah , you 'd try some wine , you were going to sleep with them . <p> They thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to sleep with them . <p> They thought that it was no fun having sex with a virgin , it was a dirty job but someone had to do it . Sort of a civic duty . <p> So it was the worst afternoon of my life . And the guy came out of it feeling like a boy scout who 'd just helped an old lady across the street . <p> The problem with heating up goons is it just makes them mad . So Evan 's roadie called the reporters from the hospital and told them the whole story . I was n't bearing Evan 's clone because I was some California weirdo who never had the chance to raise her kid the first time . I was growing an organ donor . <p> Now it was n't only reporters camping outside my place , scaring the livestock , running over my cat , annoying the hell out of the neighbors . It was right-to-life fanatics too . They called me names you ca n't repeat in public even now . They threatened to kill me . Real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my phone number , checked all mail for explosives . Tony and I alternated days of hiding in the house with days of sitting on the hood of my car and yelling back . <p> I was showing by then , wearing stretch pants and waddling when I went to feed the horse . <p> I 'd bred her seven times . I was convinced she was smirking at me . Now I 'd know what a pain motherhood was . <p> I did n't tell Mom and Dad about the rape . See , it did n't matter if you 'd done it on purpose or not , ruin was ruin . I was n't a virgin anymore , and that meant I was evil . A disgrace to the family . A whore . <p> Besides , I knew they 'd take his side . I 'd gone over to a guy 's house to hear a bootleg Dylan tape . I 'd asked for it ! <p> I kept it secret because I did n't have a choice . When I 'd gone without my period for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed . I could n't do what Mary 'd done . I was too chicken . But it did n't matter , my parents would kill me anyway . And I deserved it . <p> Frankie called me . " We 've got a little problem , " he said . Namely his lab had been firebombed . It was almost funny . He was a fertility specialist . Other than his little deal with Evan , the vast majority of his work was devoted to helping people have babies . That 99 percent of his career goals coincided with theirs did n't stop the nuts from targeting him . <p> " And the hospital wo n't let me operate , " he said . <p> " Find one that will . " Evan had enough money , someone would give <p> Frankie temporary privileges long enough for one lousy hysterectomy . <p> Then came the injunction . <p> I thought , you know , I 'm an adult . I can do what I want with my body . <p> No total stranger can go to court and sue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Boy , was I naive . <p> Time was running out . It was five months . At six the annoying growth became a legal person , and I 'd be stuck with him . Shit . <p> We had lawyers , they had lawyers . They dressed like yuppies and bragged like TV wrestlers before a match . That did n't give me much confidence . <p> I was sent to visit " Aunt Martha in Missouri . " I had no Aunt Martha in Missouri . What I had was a concentration camp where you did chores and got moral lectures from the nuns , with schoolwork in whatever spare time was left . By the time they were done with you , you had no doubt that you were a worthless piece of shit doomed to hell in this world and beyond . Unless you decided to become a nun yourself , and atone by making other unlucky girls miserable . <p> Some people glow when they 're pregnant . Some people say it 's the best time of their life . I figure they must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nausea , the back pain , the forty extra pounds weighing you down . All leading up to the delightful experience of trying to shove an object the Size of a watermelon through a hole the size of a needle . <p> I did it without anesthesia . Without the support of anyone who thought of me as anything more than a moral lesson . <p> On the upside , it 's very easy to escape from a maternity hospital . No one expects it . <p> It 's also easy to hitchhike to the Haight Ashbury , to change your name , to move into a commune and learn to make dulcimers and jam . It 's easy to build a new life  --  until the old one finally catches up with you . <p> Pregnancy sucked when I was sixteen . The second time was worse . My back was already bad , my ankles swollen anyway ; I did n't need the additional stress . <p> " If I do n't get rid of this fetus next week , I 'm going to be stuck with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen table , having a war conference . <p> " Do n't worry , we 'll take care of it , " said the lawyer . <p> " So you 've said . For three months . Why am I not reassured ? " <p> " I need this damn clone , " said Evan . " I 'm dying remember ? " <p> " Worse comes to worst , " said Tony , " we head to Mexico and get the surgery there . " <p> " There 's an injunction against me leaving the state . " <p> " I 've got a friend who smuggles dope , he 'll fly us . " Tony was very resourceful . " If we ca n't come back , hell , money goes further down there . I know some friends with a cantina in Baja . " Practical too . <p> " I 'm an officer of the court , do n't say anything about breaking injunctions in front of me , " said the lawyer . " I have a friend in San Diego who does a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I need a drink , " said Evan . <p> So we got in Tony 's pickup truck and drove through the demonstrators to a crummy bar on the outskirts of town . <p> " I 'm having a drink , " I said . " You 're pregnant . You ca n't drink . " <p> " Pregnant women have had a drink since the dawn of time and it has n't hurt a damn thing . Gim me a bourbon . " <p> For some reason this really ticked off Evan . " You bitch , did you drink when you were pregnant with me ? Is that why I 'm all screwed up ? " <p> " Trust me , I would of if I could of . " <p> " Oh yeah , you 'd have liked it if I 'd been retarded or had three arms or something . " <p> " You ca n't hold your liquor , " I said . " You never got that from me . " <p> " What did I get from you ? " Evan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mom who never wanted me ... " <p> " You ca n't speak to your mother like that , " said Tony . <p> " I can say anything I want . I own you . Own you all ! " <p> So Tony hit him over the head with a pool cue . And ran like hell . You should n't annoy a biker , even when he 's sober . <p> The only TV shows the nuns let us watch were The Flying Nun and Bewitched . I still ca n't watch Bewitched . Think about it . The woman is a witch . When she gets married she 's expected to give up her identity , her entire self , and just be a housewife . Whenever she does something bright , fixes things , she 's betraying her husband . Go figure . <p> All I can do now is watch TV and hope the rent-a-cops keep the loonies out . Last week a drive-by maniac shot one of my dogs . Life-affirming , huh ? <p> I got a postcard yesterday from Tony , somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and woke up one day to find himself married and teaching philosophy to high school students . And I thought my life was hell . <p> I 'm so damn pregnant I can barely move . I look like a balloon about to pop . Social Services tried to get me to go to Lamaze classes . I told them to get bent . <p> The baby will come . That 's the thing about life , once that sperm hits that egg you 've got no choice about it . You 're going to take a risk and hurt like hell whatever way you go . <p> The lawyers are still fighting . Only now Evan 's lawyers are squabbling with his adopted parents ' lawyers over the estate . The baby could be born with a silver spoon up his nose . It seems that maybe the fetus is Evan 's real heir  --  it 's not only his illegitimate kid , but genetically it is him . This should break legal ground , they tell me . I could care less . <p> Some friends of mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are desperate to have a kid . I do n't know why , it 's something genetic , I guess . But they like jam and dulcimers and stray dogs , so I 've promised them the baby . If they get twenty million bucks with it , hey , good karma comes back to you . <p> I did n't want the kid twenty-five years ago , and I do n't want him now . It 's just that last time , society screwed me . This time , I did it to myself . <p> <p> By S. N. Dyer <p> S.N.
