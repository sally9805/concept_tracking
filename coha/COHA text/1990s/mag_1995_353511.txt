Aloysius Snuffleupagus is under siege . It 's nothing personal against the beloved elephantine creature from Sesame Street , but as a symbol of quality children 's television , Snuffy is trying to hold the fort while Rita Repulsa , Newt Gingrich , Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills , Armani-clad copywriters from Madison Avenue , Rupert Murdoch , professional wrestlers , professional lobbyists and Nickelodeon emcees armed with green gook storm the walls . <P> Despite years of efforts by parents , educators , children's-TV activists , and occasional FCC commissioners and members of Congress , the forces of commercial television are overwhelming the true believers in quality children 's programming . Peggy Charren , founder of the now defunct advocacy group Action for Children 's Television , says , " There are more choices than when I began act 27 years ago because of cable and the vcr , but broadcast television has just gotten worse . What 's so sad is that 's all that 's available to poor children , and they are the ones who need the most help . " Newton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " vast wasteland " in 1961 , argues in a new book ( see excerpt ) that children 's TV is still a wasteland-and that the government ought to step in and do something about it . <P> Indeed , these are perilous times for those who care about what our children watch on television . Consider : <P>  --  The 28-year-old Children 's Television Workshop , producer of such acclaimed programs as The Electric Company , 3-2-1 Contact and Square One TV , is down to a single show in first-run production , namely Sesame Street . In February , abc canceled ctw 's animated Saturday-morning science program CRO , and its pbs show Ghostwriter is on indefinite hiatus , having lost its funding . In the fiscal year that ended in June 1994 , ctw lost $5.8 million , and two weeks ago it had to lay off 47 people  --  12% of its staff . <P>  --  While Senate majority leader Robert Dole and Speaker of the House Gingrich bemoan the state of American culture , they oppose government mandates on children 's programming and demand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nauseating , " says Charren , " that the same guy Dole who is attacking what 's terrible in entertainment is working very hard to keep the alternatives from getting on the TV screen . " <P>  --  Efforts to put some regulatory teeth into the Children 's Television Act of 1990  --  which requires that TV stations air at least some " educational and informational " programming for kids  --  are long overdue . FCC chairman Reed Hundt is soliciting comment on several proposals , including one that would require broadcasters to air at least three hours of quality children 's fare each week but would allow them to pay other stations  --  presumably PBS stations  --  to run two of those three hours . Representative Edward Markey , the Massachusetts Democrat who sponsored the 1990 act , has said that the proposal " completely fails children . " <P>  --  While programming choices for kids have multiplied with the explosion of cable channels , much of the most popular children 's fare still gives parents fits . The king of them all , Fox 's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month will appear on the big screen for the first time ; that means small children will be kicking one another in record numbers as they exit the local multiplex.
