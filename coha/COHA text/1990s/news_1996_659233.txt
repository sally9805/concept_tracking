<p> In the fall of 1991 , two wood crates arrived at CIA headquarters from the Persian Gulf on an Air Force cargo plane . The flight manifest said they contained " radio equipment " destined for a lower-echelon worker in the spy agency 's Latin America department . <p> It was not radio equipment . <p> Inside those boxes and others in the shipment were enough guns and ammunition to invade a small island . <p> But they contained something much greater - an embarrassing postscript to the Gulf War . It seems that a cocky ex-general and a sticky-fingered gunsmith had tried to sneak guns home , and with a flimsy lie they had almost snookered their employer , the Central Intelligence Agency . <p> Two rascals had nearly pirated a tidy arsenal . What 's more , the agency knew - or should have known - they were rascals when it hired them . <p> For five years this episode has remained untold , even while it dragged on into a federal court case . <p> The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its files . The agency refused to release other records , claiming they are " CIA classified files . " Yet much is on the public record - including the CIA 's internal report - at U.S. District Court in Alexandria , where the story reached its climax with the ex-general 's indictment and acquittal . <p> The story begins a world away , in the Middle East . <p> Fleeing Iraqis had left the Gulf War wastelands littered with weapons . Abandoned guns and grenade launchers , mortar shells and bullets turned the desert into a paradise for souvenir hunters . <p> The U.S. government claimed title to the spoils , however . Anyone else was forbidden by order of Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf and federal gun laws . <p> The CIA wanted some of that war booty . Here was a gold mine to supply America 's secret friends while checking out arms-making by its enemies . <p> The agency assigned scavengers to pick through the pile . Among them were retired Army Brig . Gen. Charles Getz , a CIA free-lancer ; Wayne Osentoski , a top CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man usually assigned to Latin America operations . <p> The four accomplished their mission . But Getz also wanted guns for his own purposes . <p> The weapons in question , 54 in all , were powerful , and exotic . The inventory included Soviet pistols , AK-47 machine guns and grenade launchers ; British submachine guns ; Iraqi pistols ; Belgian , British , German and Egyptian rifles ; plus a 60 mm Chinese mortar ; and a 84 mm Swedish training rocket . There was even a Hungarian copy of a Walther PPK , the sidearm favored by fictitional British superspy James Bond . <p> Also in the haul were 1,800 rounds of ammunition . <p> Getz is the central character in this saga ; he has said he only wanted guns to give them away , as gifts . <p> " This Getz is a blowhard ... and he was trying to impress a lot of people , " said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Rich , who prosecuted Getz . " And he was one of these guys we call a ' barrel sucker ' " - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marines . Like Getz , he rose to brigadier general . " There are a lot of barrel suckers around , " Rich said . " A good number ... are Army , Navy , Marine Corps . They 're just a big fraternity of barrel suckers . " <p> The West Point yearbook for the Class of 1959 sized up Getz : " Studies were never any trouble for him because he never let little things worry him . With his winning ways , Charlie is headed for much success in later years . " <p> In Vietnam , Getz earned a Distinguished Service Cross , the nation 's second-highest award for bravery . The citation reports that as a battalion commander he left the protection of a helicopter to sprint through gunfire , kill three enemy soldiers , plunge into an enemy tunnel to pluck out one more - then lead two platoons to wipe out an enemy camp . <p> In 1980 he made general , the first in his class . <p> Then he took a VCR from a Navy exchange in the Philippines without paying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Max Thurman blasted Getz in a Nov. 20 , 1985 , letter of reprimand . Thurman was Army vice chief of staff , second man from the top . He called Getz " reprehensible . " <p> Getz shot back a three-page excuse : the VCR was a lemon ; he had pricier models on layaway ; he needed it for work ; he had returned it when his tour ended . He also suggested his Filipino accusers were crooks . <p> Thurman let the reprimand stand . <p> Promotion unlikely , Getz left the Army in 1988 and became an independent contractor for the CIA . <p> The second key player in the scheme was Wayne Osentoski . <p> A skilled gunsmith and shooter , Osentoski had worked for 10 years at the Connecticut Army National Guard in Windsor Locks , Conn. , as a gun repairman . Weekends he competed on the Guard 's marksmanship team , winning accolades for his prowess . <p> CIA records say that before Osentoski was hired in 1981 , a lie- detector test revealed he had pocketed weapons parts , tools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Osentoski , since retired from the agency , disputes the CIA 's interpretation of his test results . He pilfered no parts , he said in an interview from West Virginia , where he lives . " I said I had them legally in my possession , and turned them in before I left . " <p> As for poaching weapons in the Persian Gulf , Osentoski said , " We did n't do anything that had n't been done a million times before . " <p> Osentoski evaluated the weapons and , with his helper , packed the boxes . The logistics man arranged for shipping , obtaining a cargo number for the two boxes of " radio equipment " from his unwitting supervisor . <p> On Sept. 14 , 1991 , the weapons flew out of Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington . When they reached CIA handlers , the two crates aroused a buzz of questions . <p> The scheme was already unraveling . <p> When the logistics man returned to the United States in August , he learned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kickback on a private recreational vehicle when he bought two agency cars . <p> Unnerved , the logistics man confessed to a CIA security officer that two guns in a shipment for a " General Getz " were actually for him . He said he no longer wanted the guns . <p> Two days later , CIA in-house detectives opened their investigation . They spent more than a year untangling a knot of deceit in which stories changed or did n't match . <p> Wading through the conflicting accounts , it seems Getz wanted at least the 12-gauge East German shotgun for himself . Prosecutors later identified 15 weapons as Getz 's intended cache . Osentoski was to get at least a German rifle , an Egyptian semiautomatic rifle and a pistol . The logistics officer had his eye on an Italian shotgun and a rifle , while Osentoski 's aide hoped to get a rifle , a pistol , a tank periscope , a weapon sight , M-16 magazines and six road spikes . <p> But what of the rest ? <p> For about half the weapons , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected or who was to get them . Osentoski variously claimed they were for Getz , or other CIA departments , maybe the CIA Historical Exhibit . <p> Some witnesses told interrogators they had been told Getz wanted the weapons for various officers , for an Army sniper school , as a " thank you " for helpful troops from Fort Bragg , N.C. <p> The story Getz told most often , and which helped win his acquittal , was that he planned to donate most of the guns to the U.S. Army Ranger Museum . Sometimes he placed the museum at Fort Bragg , N.C. , other times at Fort Benning , Ga . <p> The location did n't matter , because no such museum exists . <p> But Army Col. David Grange , who was married to one of Getz 's daughters , showed government investigators a display of Ranger mementoes - the so-called " museum " at Fort Benning . <p> He said the donation idea germinated shortly after the war ended . The two men met in Kuwait City . Grange was about to take over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need Iraqi weapons . Grange is now a brigadier general at the Pentagon ; through a spokesman , he declined to be interviewed . <p> On Aug. 30 , 1990 , shortly after Schwarzkopf took charge of Operation Desert Shield , he issued General Order No. 1 forbidding anyone , military or civilian , from taking enemy weapons as keepsakes . <p> But Getz 's gift list , it appears , included top brass . <p> Investigators linked Getz to Maj. James Guest , the head of Special Forces whose younger brother , Robert , was deputy commanding general of Operation Desert Storm . When they first interviewed James Guest , he claimed ignorance of questionable shipments by Getz , whom he had known some 30 years . <p> Then he remembered a call from Robert , who said he was " shipping guns for Getz " and would James like Getz to get him a war trophy ? <p> In a later sworn statement , James Guest said he spoke directly to Getz . " I made a fleeting remark to him , in passing , that if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one . " <p> James Guest , 58 , retired to Toccoa , Ga. , where he is part owner of a ceramic coating company . <p> " What Charlie was going to do before they put the clamp on the weapons ... , " said the one-time leader of the Green Berets , without completing the sentence . " I guess everybody in the United States was wanting one for these museums - and that 's what he intended to do . " <p> Robert Guest runs an Army school at Fort Lee . He would not talk about the case . " I 've done lots of things since then , " he said . " I 'm just not willing to discuss something that was in the courts . " <p> When the matter was handed to federal prosecutors , they cast Getz as the mastermind and Osentoski as an eager opportunist . A federal grand jury charged both men with conspiracy , stealing government property , illegally transporting weapons across state lines , illegally importing weapons into the United States , lying to CIA investigators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the United States . <p> In a plea bargain , Osentoski pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor - stealing two rifles valued at under $ 100 . He paid a $ 1,000 fine but kept his federal gun license . <p> Today the 54-year-old Osentoski lives in Kearneysville , W.Va. , and works as quality control manager in an ammunition recycling plant . " You know , we 're not the choir boys , " he said of his dozen years in the spy game . <p> He 's lost touch with Charlie Getz , he said . <p> Just 37 miles away in the village of Round Hill , Getz makes his home in a brick- and stone-faced ranch house 3 miles down a dirt road below the Blue Ridge Mountains . <p> Getz wo n't say who employs him now , and he declined to tell his side of the story one more time . " The case was closed , and I want to leave it that way , " he said . <p> U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr . spared Getz two years in federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1994 , verdict acquitting Getz in a bench trial , Bryan called the case " extremely close . " After chiding Getz for his behavior and conflicting testimony , Bryan concluded , " I ca n't say beyond a reasonable doubt I am convinced he had criminal intent . <p> " I think he probably did , but probably is not enough . " <p> Asked recently to explain his ruling to a reporter , Bryan said he could n't recall the case . <p> " Even if I did , " the judge said , " I would n't discuss it with you . " <p> As for Osentoski 's aide and the logistics man , they escaped criminal charges . They were both reprimanded by the CIA but the agency continues to employs them . <p> Many in the military accused of violating the booty ban fared far worse . <p> More than 280 people faced charges . Scores were court-martialed . Some were booted out of the service . One man spent a year in Fort Leavenworth , Kan . An Air Force major general accused of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashed his pension nearly 25 percent . <p> The CIA regards the episode as an aberration . <p> " Anything like this is extremely rare , " said CIA spokesman Rick Oborn . " For numbers of weapons and numbers of people involved ... there 's really no precedence for this . " <p> The CIA , he insisted , " has always been very particular about the people it hires , " Oborn said . <p> And the guns ? The CIA spokesman says the guns were destroyed .
