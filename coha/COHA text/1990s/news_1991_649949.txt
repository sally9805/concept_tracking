<p> On the imitation wood-grain surface of the table lay a pile of fliers , small print dominated by letters two inches high : STOP THE WAR NOW ! Like Proust 's madeleine on low-grade bond , it flung me back , to hundreds of undergraduate bulletin boards , dozens of speeches , but especially to one march in 1972 . I held my notebook like a shield between my face and the angry man , on his way home from the night shift , who was watching people move down the avenue beneath banners of peace . " Put down that they 're a disgrace to this country , " he shouted over the noise of the chanting . " Put down that I 'm a veteran of World War II . " <p> By the imitation wood-grain table sat a man , narrow as an exclamation point , telling why he came to the first meeting of the New York City chapter of the Military Families Support Network . " I 'm a World War II veteran , " he said softly . " My youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be a war . There must be another way of dealing with this . It seems to be going on every 20 years . It has to stop . " <p> Today we wake in the shadow of war , some from the sound sleep of onlookers , others from the long nights of parents , wives , husbands and children of soldiers . The antiwar effort now is immediate and powerful , as though it were a kind of retribution . This time , the activists seem to be saying , we will get it right . There are marches and vigils planned aplenty . There is an 800 number that provides information on resistance and a 900 number that arranges overnight delivery of letters to senators and Congressmen . Every leading religious denomination and several powerful labor unions have come out in opposition to war in the Persian Gulf . <p> This is not because of great similarities between Southeast Asia and the Middle East . It is because of great differences between who we are now and who we were then . With the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom and the disintegration of our families , we are a nation struggling to understand itself . One of the most powerful events of our national history was fermenting and souring 20 years ago , a war that divided and defined us in ways we came to hate . <p> Our national character has changed . Our notions of masculinity , always linked to our notions of face and force , are different today . The woman thing , as the President might call it , has shaped this event . Statistics show a gender gap : 57 percent of men in a recent Times poll favored military action if Iraq does not withdraw from Kuwait by Tuesday 's deadline , while 37 percent said we should give sanctions more time to work . The results for women were almost exactly the opposite : 36 percent voted for immediate action , 56 percent for patience . <p> Our earliest image of this conflict was of women in camouflage fatigues kissing their children goodbye ; say what we will about the idea that fathers are as important as mothers , it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war means . ( Memo to Senator Alfonse D'Amato : Forget the rhetoric about " our boys " during debates and fast-forward to 1991 . ) Last week a group of feminists demonstrated , personifying the button making the rounds : We 're Going To War To Defend People Who Wo n't Let Women Drive ? <p> To the extent that we still think of men as resolving differences through force and women through talk , there is a feminization of national feeling . Macho is no longer our national pastime , and there seems to be a declining number of little boys exhorted " Go out there and fight like a man . " So far , no " Love It or Leave It " bumper stickers . " I love my country , but . . . " began two of the testimonials at the Military Families Support Network meeting . <p> We no longer have illusions about war . We have seen the carnage on CNN . Some protesters are sending the White House black plastic trash bags , to remind the President of how people come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be the shadow of another war . But it is really the shadow of what we will think of ourselves when this is over . Dorothy Thompson , for many years America 's most prominent woman columnist , wrote a column after World War II about disarmament . " You can not talk to the mothers with planes and atomic bombs , " she wrote . " You must come into the room of your mother unarmed . " <p> Some of her editors found her sentiments treacly and hard to take . They need to be updated in one respect ; many of the fathers now feel the same way . Some people consider this a failure of will . I think it 's progress .
