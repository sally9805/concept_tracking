Top tube length For Rarick , this is the most important frame dimension . His rule of thumb : If your shoulder blades are drawn forward , the bike 's too long . Conversely , if your back is hunched , it 's too short . ( See also : " Stem and handlebar . " ) DO IT YOURSELF Check your shoulder and back position in a mirror while riding the bike on a trainer Fore/aft saddle position Rarick positions the knee over the pedal spindle by dropping a plumb line as described in the road bike section-with one qualifier . " Once we have it right , the saddle should be clamped in the middle of the rails so there 's some room for adjustment , " he says . " If you have to shove the saddle all the way forward , the seat-tube angle is too slack . " ( A laid-back seat tube-less than 72 degrees-places the rider farther rearward . ) Also , the top of the saddle should be horizontal to the ground or have the nose tilted down 1 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower , both for increased low-rpm power as well as greater agility in technical terrain . Rarick eyeballs riders to ensure that there 's a significant bend in the knee . DO IT TOUR SELF Find the saddle height that eliminates hip rock ( see previous page ) , then lower the saddle another 3-5 millimeters to accommodate the rigors of off-roading ( Figure A ) . Handlebar width " Most bars are too wide , " says Rarick , " so we use a hacksaw to cut almost every one . But we never take off more than inch at a time . You ca n't put it back on if you make a mistake . " Most standard ( flat ) bars are 22-23 inches-a good width for control and leverage , but too wide for forested singletrack or a narrow , wind-cheating position . Most rise bars are 25-27 inches . DO IT YOURSELF Shoulder width also affects this-you may find you can breathe easier with a wider bar , which opens the chest . How do you make the change ? Most brake and shift levers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly . The best way to remove grips is to pry up the end with a screwdriver and drip alcohol inside . This will loosen them enough to slide off . To install grips , use hair spray . It will enable you to slide on the grips , but then it dries fast . Stem and handlebar With the correct frame size , a 120- to 130-mm stem should provide the right reach . " If you have to install a 150-mm stem to get enough reach , the top tube is too short , " says Rarick . Two other factors affect reach : stem " rise " and handlebar type . Off-road stems vary in rise angle from 0 to about 10 degrees , affecting your reach to the bar which affects your back angle . And using one of the popular riser handlebars with an upward bend will shorten the distance even more .
