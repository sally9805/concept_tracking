Im sure one of those near-therapists with a bestseller book on the nonfiction charts has a theory why sometimes men leave home under the guise of going to buy one of the necessary food groups , only to drive aimlessly . Not that I ever watch television talk shows in the afternoon , but I would bet one of those women has had an entire segment on men , and why they talk to complete strangers . I 'd bet the whole studio audience has a thousand reasons and answers , and it all comes down to something like fear of commitment . Fuck America . Me , I collect ashtrays . I quit smoking cigarettes , and I took up collecting glass advertising ashtrays , especially the kind with short phone numbers like BA9-3822 , or 3822 , or 22 . You 've seen them before : Tom Taylor Motors  --  DeSoto Sales and Service-Phone 6I73 . They 're harder to come by these days , probably because I own nine thousand of the things . <p> I 'd just bought two dozen cool ashtrays for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flea market outside Athens , Georgia , and was on my way home a hundred miles away . I 'd gotten a fifty-pound bag of dog food at the flea market , too-that 's the whole reason why I left my own driveway-when out of nowhere this bar popped up on the side of the road with only " J of N " painted across the threshold . A nonlighted rent-a-sign with one of those Holiday Inn kind of arrows stood out front with magnetic letters promising a pool tournament . I did n't give a shit milkshake whether or not I could win fifty bucks that moment , but it looked like the kind of bar that might have its own ashtrays , et cetera , and I 've been known to stick a Huddle House in my down vest more than once . <p> The woman at the flea market said her ex-husband was a traveling salesman . It did n't matter to me . She kept pulling out bad motel ashtrays from up and down the east coast , and you 'd think she'd 've figured something out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled into the J of N bar , locked my doors twice , and walked in like I knew everything there is to know about dark shotgun shack bars on minor roads off major interstates . I sat down at the counter between a peanut machine and a jar of pink pickled eggs and said to the bartender , " Whatever 's cold , " like that , you know-like he should 've seen from my face that I did n't care to drink an import , or anything from St. Louis or the Rocky Mountains , that the beer I wanted got brewed in Milwaukee and nowhere else . <p> He did me right , of course . I said , " Hotdamn that 's a good flea market y'all got yourselves down the road , " because from the looks on the six or eight guys in the bar I knew that they sold their wares there between the pine trees of the jockey lot . I said , " Say , what 's ' J of N ' stand for ? Why 's this bar called J of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Narcotics , " and " Jalapenos and Nachos , " and " Jets and Napalm . " That 's the mood I was in . <p> The bartender looked at me hard and said , " Jesus of Nazareth . It stands for Jesus of Nazareth , son . " <p> What do you say to something like that with a Pabst Blue Ribbon in your palm ? I said , " Huh . " <p> " It used to be a church . Now it 's a bar . I do n't make no claims . It 's only the fact . " The bartender had a high voice , and when he said that last thing it sounded like he sang some kind of Neil Young song . <p> I said , " I quit smoking cigarettes , but now I have this horrendous obsession with collecting ashtrays . I 've been at the flea market checking out ashtrays . You ai n't got no ashtrays with ' J of N ' on them , by any chance . " <p> My dogs usually eat in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I did n't go out to get dog food at eight , drive a hundred miles et cetera , finally get the dog food , and then go to a bar at two o'clock . Understand that I just got up and said to my wife Martie , " Hey , we 're out of dog food , " like that , and then started driving south on I-85 for some reason . <p> The guy to my left said , " I got an ashtray that says KOA on it . It 's metal . It 's red and metal , and says KOA . " <p> The other men laughed . One guy raised his can of beer . There were no women inside J of N. I said , " I 'll give you fifty cents for it , " only because I felt sorry for the guy immediately , and knew that he 'd end up shifting over a stool and telling me some kind of story that involved a high school equivalency exam , house trailer , drowned child , and one of the fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Homer , New York . I said , " If it 's made of pure gold I 'll give you a dollar . " The bartender slid a beer only six inches to my partner . The bartender said , " On the house , Herbert . " <p> " Shit , " the guy with the KOA ashtray said , " I 'll give it to you , man . " He looked at the bartender and said , " House , house , house-goddamn it , Cuz , do n't rub it in . " <p> I did n't call Martie in the next hour , because Herbert kept talking . He said , " My wife and I lived in a regular ranch-style house . There was a tree farm across the street . I had a job over at the shirt factory , and Helen worked for some lawyers doing their busy work . She was somewhere between a secretary and a real lawyer , is what I 'm saying . Anyways , the guy who owned the tree farm sold off his land , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right across from our house . Let me say this : when a tree farm 's cut down , some field rats lose their homes . All these rats showed up in our garage and basement , and I guess some tension built on both our parts . Next thing you know , I 'm moving out . " <p> I did n't know what to say . At this point in the story I figured that Herbert 's wife needed blaming so I said , " My wife has so many personalities she could work as a one  --  woman chorus . " It just came to me , like that . To be truthful , my wife Martie let me drive around aimlessly whenever I wanted , no matter what every psychologist in America might say about it . I said , " You show me a woman in love with tree farms and I 'll show you a woman who wo n't buy you toilet paper when a snowstorm 's on the way . " I swear to God that everyone inside J of N looked over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Virgin Mary pictures . I said , " Because she does n't like killing trees to turn into paper , you know . " <p> Herbert said , " I just moved across the street . Helen told me to leave , and I did . I moved across the street . We did n't do no split-up of the valuables-I just took the tent , seeing as I 'd bought it so we could go to Myrtle Beach once a year . I took my clothes . " <p> I ordered two beers . I asked the bartender what his name was . He said , " Pabst ? " I figured out later , though I called him " Pat " for the rest of the night . <p> " Tell him about Helen 's signs , Herbert , " this guy from around the L-shaped bar said . I 'd not seen this fellow at the flea market , but I could tell he was the kind of man who set up a table selling cheap chalkware . He had an uncontrolled beard . " Tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Herbert stared straight ahead . Pat turned a cassette over in the tape deck , and hit Play . Herbert blew air out of his mouth and made his lips do that motorboat sound . George Jones started singing about the bars being all closed . I looked at fake pictures behind the bar of Pat shaking hands with famous sports personalities : Hank Aaron , Richard Petty , Joe Willie Namath . Pat wore the same clothes in each photo-a blue tuxedo-and his right hand was cut off in a way so that his wrist jabbed into the other guy 's grip . <p> Herbert said , " Do n't think I do n't have a gun on me , Rodney , " and pulled this pistol out of his sock , of all places . Herbert set it on the counter as if it were a half  --  eaten pickled egg . <p> Pat the bartender only nodded . I said , " Maybe I should 've gotten my head shaved before I came in here . That 'd make it easier for the emergency room doctors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back for an emergency exit . When I 'm not buying old glass ashtrays with abbreviated phone numbers printed on them , I 'm searching for emergency exits . <p> Herbert said , aReconciliation , not Divorce . Heart , not Thought . Living , not Life . ' He nodded his head with each syllable , pretty much . He said , " I put these signs in the front yard until she got the restraining order , Smokey . She got the restraining order once I went out and put one up that said Oven , not Sterno . Fuck , I had to move one campsite backwards when the judge said I could n't stay within a hundred yards . " I do n't know why , but I said , " My name 's Norfleet . Do n't call me Smokey . Dan Norfleet . Everyone calls me Norfleet , though . Hey , man , I know what you 're saying . Listen , sometimes I get all my ashtrays out on the floor and just listen to what stories comes out of the crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes I got all my ashtrays out and looked at them . Other times I heard voices , no lie . There was n't a day that went by where I did n't plain drive around on purpose , thinking some junk shop might be there that was n't the day before . <p> Herbert said , " I got the KOA ashtray now . I bet I got a hundred other ashtrays inside my house . Helen used to steal ashtrays all the time when she went to those conferences she used to go to . Listen , I know what you 're thinking . My wife did n't screw any of those lawyers she works with , though . I can prove that , if nothing else . " He pointed in my face , as if I were a seventh grader telling the teacher on him for farting . <p> I said , " I believe you , man . Hey , did your wife ever have to go to a conference in either Omaha or Topeka ? " Out of all the ashtrays I owned-I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Kansas . It 's as if people there never smoked , as if they just walked around clenching shoots of wheat from their mouths . Pat took George Jones out of the tape player . He stuck in Merle Haggard . Understand that I did n't mind any of this at all . Even though no one at the bar may have seen me as a regular , I felt at home . <p> Herbert said , " My wife 's been to Six Flags twice , goddamn it . " <p> Martie did n't think the tobacco industry would ever get squashed . Martie thought America would go through some kind of moral scrub-a-dub with itself , and then we 'd all be OK later . She thought in time everyone could go to a regular bar and listen to jazz music and smoke cigarettes freely . Fuck , my wife thought marijuana would get legalized before we died . More than once she said to me , " Norfleet , fuck off . " She thought hotels , motels , bars , restaurants , truck stops , casinos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and doughnut joints would once again hold cigarette  --  smoking customers , and that the ashtrays I collected would only go down in price once people became aware of the fact that they were n't collectible . <p> Sometimes I called Martie a pessimist to her face . Sometimes I said I would n't cut the grass seeing as some scientists said a new Ice Age was on its way , so nothing mattered . When Herbert said , " Over at the flea market Madame Tammy told me the stars were in a way that should mean something other than having to settle on plain white bread , " I thought about leaving . I thought about setting down my beer and feigning vomit . " Madame Tammy 's never been wrong , in my book . She told me moving across to the campground was a good idea , that I needed a place where the same people could n't watch me daily . She said , The way of the pioneer outlaw is fairly misunderstood . ' I wrote it down . " <p> I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " like that . I did n't care . Herbert had put his pistol back in his sock . I figured that I had time to run should he pull the thing out . In my mind over the previous five minutes I 'd gone through some kung fu moves I 'd seen on TV involving swoops and curves . I said , " If you ask me-and maybe you should n't , seeing as I have a marriage that allows me to drive around aimlessly looking for ashtrays-you should pretend that your wife 's not there . Ignore her . Do n't put up signs in the yard . I read all this somewhere . Stay cool . " <p> " See ? " Pat said . " I told him . I told him , but he would n't listen to me . He 'll listen to a complete stranger , but he wo n't listen to me . " Pat dumped and swabbed a plain black plastic ashtray I did n't care about . He said , " Man asks me for an answer and gets it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants , so I give it to him . Shit . " For the first time I thought that my bartender maybe had a thing for Herbert , you know . I thought , I need some headache powders . I thought , Where 's the women in this bar to slice some of the tension ? <p> Herbert looked at me sideways , holding his chin as if he posed for a novel 's back jacket . This guy had the waviest black hair ever , too-he could 've been a stunt double for burnt meringue . " Daniel Boone was a pioneer . Davy Crockett . The Cartwrights were pioneers . And in their own ways they was outlaws , too . " I said , " Uh-huh . " <p> Herbert said , " We all need a little pioneer outlaw in us-this whole goddamn country was built on pioneer outlaws , and that 's what makes us the people we are , right ? " I did n't say anything . It seemed a rhetorical question . The guy with the beard said , " Did y'all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to God . He saw some kind of connection . I motioned for Pat to pass me one of those hot eggs . Herbert said , " That might be a good enough reason for me to go see Helen in the face and tell her I 'm sorry . Let 's you and me go over to my house and look at them ashtrays she got . " <p> I said , " I have to get home . I live way down outside of Opalika . My wife 's going to be mad at me , not to mention all my hungry and once-trusting dogs . " Herbert stared , and even though I looked in his eyes I could see those black locks on top of his head waving like some kind of evil sea anemone . He said , " It 's not one of those KOA campgrounds like in the movies . We got showers and we got telephones . I got a second tent set up , too , in case you need to crash , Smokey . " <p> I thought to myself-now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idiot I thought , Martie would n't mind making up some scrambled eggs and sliced bread for our dogs . <p> I 'm sure there 's some kind of name for people who want to see other people get in trouble-that some goddamn New Age therapist has a label for people who ca n't wait to see other human beings get in trouble one way or the other . I do n't give a shit cheese stick about psychology . But for some reason I wanted to show up at Herbert 's old house and have his wife come out with a rolling pin , like in the movies or something . I left my car at the J of N and drove out with him out there to the KOA campground , not two miles from the bar . We drove straight down the road , then took a turn into the front of the campground . A guard waved us in at the information booth . <p> We were in Herbert 's Volare . Going through the loop of tents and campers I noticed how nobody else had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeked out their flaps and wondered who this wealthy person was driving in their midst . Herbert pulled up to two tents perched right at the edge of a minor road at the back of the campground . He hit his brake lights twice , for some reason , and cut off his headlights . " I can move the stuff out of the guest tent if you want to stay , " Herbert said when we got out . He pointed across the road and said , " That 's my old house there . That 's where Helen 's living alone now . If you want some ashtrays , that 's where they 'll be . " I looked across the street , through the scattered loblolles left behind , through the honeysuckle , daylilies , slip of kudzu , and freak tulip poplar yearlings . Herbert 's house was a regular ranch-style , painted tan or gray , I could n't tell in the light . Herbert fucked up from a two-thousand-square-foot house to an eight-by-four tent , is what I 'm saying . There was about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " My dogs must be starving , " like that . " We ca n't make this much of a social visit , man . " <p> " Come on , then , " Herbert said , and I followed him through a small path , crossed a drainage ditch , crossed the two-lane bad asphalt road , and stepped foot in his old yard . I said , " I thought there was some kind of restraining order against you being a hundred yards between your wife . " <p> Herbert said the only thing I could 've imagined . He held his thumb and index finger apart and said , " My dick 's a mile long . " <p> Herbert 's wife answered the door halfway through a second round of knocking . She did n't look entirely pleased to see her husband , and opened the glass storm door only enough to say , " I hope this is your lawyer with some papers to sign . " Herbert said , " Honey , this here 's Norfleet . I brought him out here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to sell off some of those ashtrays you collected over the years . Those ashtrays . " <p> She still did n't open the door much . Helen wore a thin printed robe cinched hard right below her breasts . She looked older than Herbert , especially around the eyes . Helen looked as though she swapped third and first shift jobs every other week before she landed the job as a legal secretary . She said , " Are you a dealer ? There 's one thing that pisses me off , it 's an antique dealer buying up everything for nothing , then turning around and selling it ten times what it cost him . " <p> I said , " No , ma'am . I quit smoking . I quit smoking , and I took up a hobby . I have no intention of selling ashtrays later on . " <p> Helen looked at Herbert and said , " You know you 're not supposed to be over here . I could call the police and get you arrested . " <p> Herbert said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extra money , you know . OK , OK-call me selfish-but I wanted to know what you thought of my last sign , too . " <p> Helen held one finger up and closed the storm door . She left the front door open , though , so we 'd know she would return . Herbert said , " Two nights ago I put a sign in the yard that said , Heat , not Fire . ' It was supposed to be romantic . It was supposed to let her know that I 'd controlled my temper . " <p> From inside Helen said , " I guess y'all can come on in . Y'all can come in , but only to the kitchen . Nowhere else , Herbert . " <p> I held the door open for him . I heard Helen pull out ashtrays and set them down on the table . Right away I thought to myself , Offer her twenty-five cents each , and do n't go over a dollar . Herbert said , " She keeps them in the kitchen . She keeps them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whisper , like that 'd mean something to me . <p> I walked ahead of him and had the very first near-vision of my life : one day he 'd come over here with a stranger , feigning to have that man do something beneficial for his estranged wife , and then Helen would reach inside a cabinet pretending to go along with them and pull out a pistol the size of Florida . I said , " Dog food . I left to buy dog food , and I need to feed my dogs . " <p> In the kitchen Helen pulled out ashtrays I 'd only seen in the ashtray collectors ' books : amber and smoky four-seaters from Las Vegas , Los Angeles , and New York places long gone out of business , all worth over ten dollars each . She pulled out , no lie , a good fifty of them , plus another hundred regular Holiday Inns , Ramada Inns , Hampton Inns , Howard Johnson 's , Western Inns , and a good joint called The General Lafayette Motel on the Valley Forge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought to myself , " Offer a hundred dollars , and go up to two . " There was money in my pocket . The fifty-pound bag of flea market dog food only cost me five bucks . <p> " I told you she had her some ashtrays , " Herbert said . He put his hands down the front of his waistband in a way I knew probably added to why Helen asked him to leave . Helen said , " I think that 's it , " and made a noise when she stood up straight for good . She looked at me and said , " You do n't look like the kind of man who 'd deal in antiques and collectibles . Do n't think I do n't know what things are worth . " <p> I said , " I 'm not . Seeing as ashtrays do n't cost anything , that 's what I collect . What the hell . I like the art work and designs on the things . " Let me say this : I foresaw at that point buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a hard-on the size of a regular NASA space probe . <p> For some reason Herbert decided to pick up the one ashtray I wanted most and say , " King of Prussia ? You never went to Russia on a legal secretary convention , girl ! " like that . <p> I 'm sure there 's a game up North where kids make and stockpile a bunch of snowballs , pile them in pyramids , and wait for their best friends to come out the front door . That 's what it looked like when Helen turned and started throwing ashtrays at Herbert and me . <p> I ducked under the table . Herbert ran out the front door , and left . <p> The first thing I thought to say was this : " Well , that proves it . I do n't think I can represent your husband anymore . You 're right . He 's nuts-he brought me over here wanting to pretend that I was some kind of ashtray buyer , just so I could see that you were obsessed . He 's nuts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against the wall , and not far from her feet . She cried , and made this noise not unlike a slight siren going off in the distance . Helen said , " I knew you were his lawyer . " <p> I said , " I try not to look that way , but I ca n't get beyond it . " I stood up and held my hands out . I said , " It 's OK " <p> " It 's not OK , " Helen yelled out . She held her head in a way that some chiropractor would notice . She held her head forward , as though the last couple vertebrae between her skull and backbone were fused . " Trickery is not something we can overlook . What 's your real name ? " <p> I said , " It 's Dan Norfleet . People call me Norfleet . Just call me Norfleet , like everyone else does . " Out of the corner of my eye I saw all the shattered good ashtrays on the floor , like stalagmites . I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between stalagmites and stalactites . I said , " Your husband asked me to meet him at the J of N bar , and then he brought me over here . I need to go get my car . " Helen said , " He 's still looking in the windows . He 's got a telescope . He 's in his tent across the street looking over here . " <p> I turned around , stupid . Helen said , " Let 's give him something to look at , " and was on me like corn meal on fat dimpled bream . This is true : my old college friends make fun of me when I wo n't cheat on my wife , or tip a good Atlanta lap dancer more than five bucks a session . I do n't cheat on Martie , is what I 'm saying , and I do n't get into voyeurism outside of rubber-necking at I-85 crash sites . I do n't give a good shit corndog about my friends and their views , though , and I said to Helen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix those ashtrays up I ai n't got that much to say . " I said , " The only thing I want out of you is a trip back to Jesus of Nazareth so I can get my car and thus get home . " <p> She had my pecker out of my pants , but made no eye contact . She unzipped my pants , and pulled the thing out , and I swear was slowly melting down to the linoleum amongst the glass shards . Helen kept looking out the half-window towards the KOA campground across the way , where Herbert , evidently , watched . Helen said , " You ai n't no lawyer . You ai n't no lawyer . Goddamn it , " she said and got up . <p> I said , " Yeah , that was all a lie . It 's the first thing I thought about saying when you went on the rampage . Listen , I really collect ashtrays . It 's the truth . " She said , " Herbert 's taking pictures so when we go to divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-year I-ain't-seen-nobody separation . So he can get out of all this by saying I cheated on him . Hey , more than half this house is mine . I 'm the one who works more than he does . I 'm the one with a job . " <p> Helen stood up enough to slap me hard across the face three times in a row . I could only think , I hope Herbert 's got a camera running , so I can get something out of an assault and battery charge . <p> Then she reached down without looking and zipped my pants up hard . Luckily , I 'd retreated quickly during the first slap , thinking , Well I did n't have an orgasm , so it 's probably not adultery on either of us . <p> I ended up walking across the street to Herbert 's tent , only to find his Volare gone . I stood stupid and yelled out , " Herbert ! " like that , thinking maybe he only drove to those showers he spoke so high and mighty about earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst , playing a joke on me . The whole time I crossed Helen 's yard she stood out there on the front stoop yelling-I swear- " I can do better than that , I can do better than that , " as if I 'd walked straight out of her mouth with my pants around my ankles . <p> I had no clue what Helen meant across the way . I only looked at her from Herbert 's campsite and noticed that , underneath the front porch light she held the same expression on her face as that of an interstate dog . <p> This little Mexican kid peeked out of a tent next door and I said , " Hey , amigo , did you see the guy who lives here about fifteen minutes ago ? Did you notice if he took off in a hurry or anything ? " <p> The kid held a statue of the Virgin Mary and showed it to me , one of the little dashboard variety . Someone inside the tent said , " Julio , " and the kid said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " Adios , " and realized that I would need to ask Helen to give me a ride again . I took about three steps in her direction when she turned and ran inside the house . She switched off the front porch light but , inexplicably , turned every light on inside . I knocked hard a few times to no answer , then half-jogged around the house twice banging on every screened window . During the second lap the inside lights switched off until , back at the front door , Helen said , " I 'm calling the sheriff 's office now . " <p> I said , " Come on . Be a human being and give me a ride back to my car . At least call a cab . " <p> Helen yelled into the long narrow glass window on one side of the door , " Eye for an eye ! I 'm calling the cops . You deceived me twice , and then you made me feel ugly and useless . " <p> I stepped closer on the porch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burglar on the premises , " into , I assumed , a portable phone . I heard the crunch of ashtray shards beneath her hard soles . <p> I ran . I took off . It did n't take me five seconds to cross her yard , jump a ditch , cross the road , jump the other ditch , and wave at the little Mexican kid next to Herbert 's tent . I followed the winding dirt road out of the KOA , then followed the tree line towards the J of N bar . I thought to myself , There 's an eleventh commandment about hitchhiking in Georgia-stay away from any headlights . I thought , Since I quit smoking I can run further-if I never quit smoking and started collecting ashtrays , I 'd not be in this situation . <p> In the distance there were no sirens going off . <p> My car , of course , was n't quite the same . I went into the J of N and said , " OK , where 's Herbert ? Where 's my engine , tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give a short shit off a tall pier if Herbert 's got a gun . I want some answers . I do n't know how y'all do things in Georgia , but it 's different where I come from , how we treat strangers . " <p> Pat the bartender said , " We thought Herbert was with you . We thought y'all went on over to see Helen 's treasures . " <p> Two men at the bar turned away and laughed . Pat slid a can of beer my way . He kept eye contact with me and I interpreted it as " You 're in an area of desperate men who 'll do anything if it 'll get them some money down at the flea market . " In his face I read , " We 've all been tricked and crucified in here , mister . " <p> I sat down . In a while I 'd take an informal poll and try to figure out how to call my wife and explain the situation , the sequence of events . I thought back and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows I never watched ever got in a similar situation . I knew that whenever Herbert returned I would n't ask him where his cohorts hid what they extracted from me , or what percentage he and Helen got out of the entire scam .
