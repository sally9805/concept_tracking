The scenes are political-family gothic that read as if Tennessee Williams had written them . While riding on the campaign trail , the congressional candidate and his wife get into a screaming match in the car . He punches the dashboard ; she slaps the seat . At a stoplight , she suddenly leaps out , and the car roars away . In another scene , years later , a guest in the politician 's home overhears him singing a lullaby to his one-year-old daughter : I want a div- or-or-or-orce . I want a div-or-or-or-orce . ' ' The Governor raises the subject of divorce with fellow Governors whose marriages have broken up . Eventually , the marital spats in the Governor 's mansion grow so loud the employees want to run away and hide . <P> The specific anecdotes may be new , but the former Arkansas Governor portrayed in the meticulously detailed First in His Class , a forthcoming Clinton biography by Washington Post staff writer David Maraniss , is a familiar one . The book depicts Clinton as a lover and a fighter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was White House bound from early on . But the book , which is due out in March , resuscitates some more troubling issues as well : that as an elected official Clinton used state troopers to help him get sex , and as a presidential hopeful he tried to cover up his earlier efforts to avoid the draft . <P> According to Maraniss , who won a 1993 Pulitzer Prize for his articles on Clinton 's formative experiences , Clinton decided against running for President in 1988 in part out of fears that rumors of extramarital affairs would scuttle his chances and destroy his Family . Maraniss quotes extensively from on-the-record interviews with longtime Clinton friend and aide Betsey Wright , who described sitting down with Clinton and listing the names of women he had allegedly had affairs with and the places where they were said to have occurred . ' ' They went over the list twice , Maraniss writes , trying to figure out which women might tell their stories to the press ; at the end , Wright advised the Governor not to run . Wright also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and he for them . ' ' Wright , now a Washington lobbyist , issued a statement last week saying Maraniss misunderstood what I told him about the troopers . ' ' <P> The portions of First in His Class about the President 's attempts to avoid the draft also offer up damning new insight . According to Maraniss , when Clinton ran for Congress in 1974 , he was worried about a letter he had written to his ROTC colonel thanking him for saving me from the draft . ' ' How Clinton . . . persuaded him to return the letter is unclear , ' ' Maraniss writes , but the colonel did , and Clinton believed he had put the matter to rest . He had not ; an aide to the colonel kept a copy , which did near fatal damage during the ' 92 campaign .
