FICTION <P> 1 AMERICAN TABLOID by James Ellroy ( Knopf ) . This big , brazenly entertaining novel begins in 1958 and ends seconds before the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas . In between , James Ellroy  --  a crime-noir cult writer making his mainstream debut  --  propels two rogue FBI agents and a former Los Angeles County deputy sheriff through a fictionalized , nightmarish tour of five tumultuous years in U.S. history . Life is seldom horrifying and hilarious at the same moment . On nearly all its 576 pages , American Tabloid manages to be both . <P> 2 SABBATH 'S THEATER by Philip Roth ( Houghton Mifflin ) explores the beginnings of geezerhood ( Roth 's resolutely obnoxious hero , Mickey Sabbath , is a randy 64 ) with some of the same comic sexual energy that set readers goggling in Portnoy 's Complaint . Sabbath is an ex-puppeteer whose present occupation is perfecting his scabrous personality . As he searches his disorderly past for meaning , largely without success , he is an equal-opportunity boor , richly offensive to women , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliantly written character , rampaging through a novel about facing death in a lonely old age . <P> 3 GALATEA 2.2 by Richard Powers ( Farrar , Straus &; Giroux ) . The Galatea in this reworking of the myth is not a statue but an enormously complicated network of computer circuitry that , on a bet , is being taught to think . The Pygmalions  --  there are a couple of them  --  are an acerbic cyber-scientist and a lovelorn novelist named ( hmm ? ) Richard Powers . A scheme that might seem mechanical and too clever works out instead to be humane and thoughtful and , when the computer is troubled by 3 a.m. brooding ( " What race am I ? What races hate me ? " ) , surprisingly moving . <P> 4 LADDER OF YEARS by Anne Tyler ( Knopf ) . Here 's an almost perfect summer-weight , drip-dry , easy-care novel . Delia Grinstead is terminally comfortable , or nearly so , in her life as a 40-year-old wife and mother . The trouble is she has become all but invisible , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintest of whims , she wanders away from the family beach house and lights out for the territories . Such fantasies have grabbed all of us now and then , and Tyler writes her runaway 's adventures not just as stylish comedy but as intriguing possibility . <P> 5 OUR GAME by John le Carre ( Knopf ) . Despite much prophesying to that effect , the end of the cold war did not mean the end of the moral and political murk in which spying and spy thrillers flourish . Le Carre continues to be the master of this shadowy genre , and he is near the top of his form in his latest novel . His hero is a middle-age intelligence operative put to pasture by bosses who decide ( wrongly , as it turns out ) that his skills and mind-set are obsolete . A bittersweet love affair winds through a landscape of modern menace , whose vectors , by now quite familiar , are ethnic and religious mania . <P> NONFICTION                 @ @ @ @
