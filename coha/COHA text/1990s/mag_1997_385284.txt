WHEN A BLAZING STAR AND GRAVITY FACE OFF , GRAVITY ULTIMATELY WINS . AND WHEN IT DOES-BOOM-SUPERNOVA ! // SOME STARS ARE TOO BIG FOR THEIR OWN GOOD . A star lives its life in a constant battle with gravity . Its hot gases press outward , while gravity pulls inward . Gravity ultimately wins : The star burns out and collapses . But a big star does n't just quietly crumple . A shockwave blasts the star apart . The explosion is so bright-up to 100 million times brighter than the sun-it can be seen from other galaxies . Smaller , Smaller ... BOOM ! Astronomers call this death blast a supernova . And they never can be sure when a blast is coming . It all starts with an enormous cloud of gas , mostly hydrogen . Gravity-the attraction of each piece of matter to anothershrinks the cloud into a ball . This builds up pressure in the center . When pressure goes up , so does heat . Eventually , hydrogen atoms fuse together , forming another atom , helium . Now the battle begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should make the ball expand . But gravity is still at work , pulling the mass inward . The battling forces become locked in a standoff , turning the ball into a bright , burning star . The Standoff Keeps Going ... and Going ... and Going A star like our sun can continue this standoff for billions of years until eventually it quietly shrinks into a planet-size cinder . But astronomers believe that a much more massive star-one with at least eight times our sun 's mass-goes much more quickly and much less gently .

It may use up its hydrogen fuel in a few million years . When its fuel runs out , it starts to collapse . But the growing pressure on the star 's core heats it even more . Helium atoms fuse into carbon atoms , releasing more heat that pushes back against gravity . The Final Collapse The cycles of collapsing and heating continue . The heavier carbon atoms fuse into even heavier ones , with the heaviest ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fusing iron does n't release energy . The star is finally out of fuel . The final collapse begins . In a flash , astronomers theorize , one of two things happens next . If the star is massive enough , it collapses into a black hole-a mysterious object so dense not even light can escape its powerful gravity . In a less massive star , the core hardens and its collapse stops almost instantly . Still falling , the outer layers smack into the iron core and bounce back-with a bang . Startling Earthlings Such cosmic blowups have startled earthlings for centuries . Chinese observers noted a " guest star " in the sky in the year 1054 . Ancient Americans carved starlike pictures on sandstone-a record , some astronomers believe , of the same event . Chinese records say the star was visible for more than a year . Modern astronomers , zeroing in with telescopes , found the glowing tatters of its remains . Calling it the Crab Nebula , they measured its distance at 4,000 light years-the distance light travels in 4,000 years , or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star as little as 30 light years away could wipe out much of the life on Earth . Its intense radiation would knock out Earth 's ozone layer , a protective layer of atmosphere that shields us from the sun 's deadly ultraviolet rays . We can count our lucky stars that no nearby star-including our own sun-is likely to explode anytime soon . Photograph In this digitally mixed image , the remnants of the supernova known as Tycho 's star come in full view of the radio telescopes near Socorro , MM. , that constantly scan the skies . Tycho 's star , named after Tycho Brahe , the Danish astronomer who first reported it , is one of only four known supernovas in our galaxy and the brightest to appear in 500 years . Photograph Astronomers like Carl Pennypacker use high-tech computers and radio telescopes to scan the skies for exploding stars . // A Supernova Glossary Sidebar SEARCHING FOR SUPERNOVAS Sidebar Early astronomers had only their eyes to view supernovas . Now , a battery of space-age machines-some in space , some deep underground-helps scientists figure out why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Southern Hemisphere in 1987 , the first sign of it came as a burst of neutrinos that flashed through huge tanks of water buried deep under Japan and North America . Neutrinos are tiny particles , smaller than atoms , that pass Sidebar right through the Earth without slowing down . Scientists built the large tanks in the bottom of mine shafts , where nothing else would interfere with ultrasensitive neutrino detectors . More recently , a distant supernova that popped up in 1993 greeted scientists with X-rays that could only be detected from space . Space telescopes can see much more than the visible light streaming from a supernova ; they can detect invisible X-rays and gamma rays that ca n't reach the ground through the Earth 's atmosphere . // <p>
