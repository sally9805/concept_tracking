On Thursday Cora woke up and knew that she was in trouble . She knew it the minute she opened her eyes , knew that sometime in the night while she slept , she had crossed the threshold into final despair . She 'd been hovering on the brink of it for weeks , ever since losing her baby two months before . Since then , whispering veils of darkness had flapped about her like wings , first gently , then violently , threatening to wrap her completely and spirit her away . <p> Away to where , she did n't know , but often in the past weeks she 'd wanted to stop fighting the veils , wanted instead to reach out to the edges of grief , to pull its filmy fibers around her and sink into surrender . But everything she knew about living told her she must go on . She could n't give in  --  that would invite the anxious , pitying scrutiny of people who cared : her husband , Chris , her parents and relatives , well-meaning friends . Each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's way , they had told her , their voices stroking her unspoken pain . <p> That Thursday Chris had already left the house when Cora awoke . He 'd risen in the darkness and slipped out to work . Cora had n't heard him leaving , and in the stillness of the house she felt utterly abandoned and alone . She did n't know what Chris felt about all this anymore ; she could n't pierce the silence he 'd erected around himself like a wall . She imagined him safe within it , his sorrow folded into its appropriate place so it could n't keep trapping him as he maneuvered in the world . <p> When it had happened two months ago , they could n't have been closer . Cora had wondered if the little spirit that might have been their child had n't given them a gift after all . Chris had been so composed the afternoon that Cora had called from the doctor 's office to tell him there was something wrong with the baby . She was 19 weeks pregnant , and a routine sonogram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The baby had ceased growing ; its fragile skin had collapsed on its bones like that of a wizened old man . The doctors were advising " termination . " The word had sounded alien ; Cora could n't comprehend that they were telling her to abort her child . She kept seeing the blurred image of her baby on the black-and-white screen : a skeletal little creature , heart pumping bravely in her dry womb . The doctors explained that the baby 's lungs could not develop without fluid , that its limbs could not be exercised . The child could not survive once born ; its body would be twisted and clawed with horrible contractures ; it would never draw breath . Cora 's brother , a doctor , begged her to " give up on this one " and try again . Patiently he explained that by delaying , Cora was risking an infection in her womb that would cause her never to bear children . <p> That night Chris rocked Cora in his arms , buried his face in her hair , and told her that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for her . Cora remembered feeling fortunate to be so loved . She thought about the life the child would have , if by some miracle it lived . She saw its crippled little body , tortured and accusatory , like the skeleton on the sonogram screen . <p> The next morning at six-thirty they drove to the hospital . Sunlight streamed through the ceiling-high windows of the hospital room to which they were taken . They might have been checking into a hotel , Cora thought , as they explored the contents of the drawers and closets , noted the cleanliness of the bathroom . Cora liked the quality of light in the room and the fact that they could see the river , with tiny sloops in the distance knitting the water . <p> Soon a young resident arrived to take Cora 's blood and administer other tests . Cora had never stayed overnight in the hospital before , and she was feeling pampered . She congratulated herself on her sense of detachment . Chris 's presence made the whole thing seem rather like an adventure , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of their intertwined lives . <p> At one o'clock Cora 's doctor arrived to administer the first suppository ; she was to be given one every two hours until she delivered . The doctor had warned her that the pain would be excruciating , nothing short of " real " labor , with contractions and nausea and vomiting . " I 've prescribed something for the pain , " the doctor told her . " Do n't hesitate to ask for it . " Chris stood to one side and looked away while the doctor put the prostaglandin tablet inside Cora . <p> " Well , the die is cast , " the doctor declared , her voice falsely bright . A sudden chill rose through Cora , emanating from the base of her spine to the farthest reaches of her limbs . The sunlight dimmed a little ; the adventure palled . She felt the first intimation of the dark veils that awaited her . She remembered something Chris had told her the evening before , when she 'd wanted to wait , even though all the specialists had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris was whispered : " I hate to think of him suffering in there , gasping for breath , in pain . " Those words more than anything had helped convince her of the course she must take . She clung to the words now , trying to remind herself that their decision was merciful . <p> At three o'clock the contractions began . By that night the contractions were so close they felt like one continuous agony , and Cora wished she could drift into darkness rather that endure any more . Chris was at her side the whole time , giving her water , holding the bowl as she threw up , wheeling the drip alongside her as she stumbled to the bathroom . Cora could n't speak , could n't cry . She had to save all her wits for the pain . Her mind railed at God , at the bitterness of labor with no hope of a living child . And yet , in the midst of her desolation , she was overwhelmed by gratitude toward Chris , for his unflinching concern , his loving presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and wondered what ironic lesson the fates were trying to impart . <p> At midnight the doctor came to check on her . She pushed a plastic-gloved hand inside Cora 's body and pulled out the dead fetus , placing its crumpled form in a clinical white bucket . She reached back in for the placenta , her fist inside Cora causing a pain more brutal than even the contraction had been . Cora prayed fervently for the ordeal to be over , for the long night to end . But the placenta could not be reached . It was trapped somehow , and Cora 's body refused to deliver it . The doctor left with the nurse to find forceps , a better light , other surgical equipment . Cora breathed deeply , the pain momentarily gone . <p> Chris was standing over the bucket , which the nurse had placed on the night table . Almost furtively , he nudged the cover aside and looked in . " It 's a boy , " he said . Chris had wanted a boy . <p> " What does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Like a little rubber doll , " Chris answered , his voice also hushed , " much bigger than I expected . " <p> " How big ? " Cora asked . Chris made a sphere with his hands ; the circular air inside them was the baby 's head . <p> " That big , " Cora murmured and closed her eyes . <p> " Will seeing him give you nightmares ? " she asked after a while . <p> " No , " Chris said . " I 'm glad I looked . " <p> " Let me see ; I want to see him , too . " <p> " Are you sure , Cora ? " <p> " Yes , " Cora said weakly . " Very sure . " <p> Chris brought the bucket to the side of the bed and held it low enough for Cora to look inside . Their baby boy , lying in profile in the bucket , looked perfectly formed . His head was smooth and incredibly round , his tiny ears exquisitely shaped , two muscular little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five delicate toes . He looked nothing like he had on the sonogram , a skeletal monster , more like a rodent , not human at all . In the bucket , in life , their baby looked flawlessly proportioned , impossibly human  --  a little rubber doll , Chris had said , serene-looking . Dead . <p> They took the placenta surgically the next morning , and at lunchtime Chris and Cora went home . Everyone called to offer condolences . The house brimmed with flowers and gifts : Cora thought how blessed she was to have so much support . But after a few days , she wished everyone would stop calling . The voices over the phone were thick with pity , so that Cora felt obliged to act more damaged than she felt . Eventually she stopped answering the phone ; if Chris was home , she let him take the calls . " We just have to look ahead . We 're young , we can start again , " she heard her husband say over and over again . More and more often , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other babies , she found herself thinking , but not that baby , not that little boy . <p> One cousin , an apprentice spiritual healer , explained to Cora that on the other side time is a meaningless whisper , and that the baby 's spirit would possibly come back to them in their next child . She speculated that the baby had come and gone so quickly to help Chris and Cora work out some mutual karma ; with the loss of their child , she assured Cora , a mysterious debt from another life had quietly been paid . Cora liked to imagine the possibility of other lives ; she liked to think that souls came together after death , in a place where loved ones were reunited and all sorrow erased . If Cora could keep her thoughts running in this stream , she felt comforted , for she could contemplate the time that she would find her lost baby 's soul ; her love would draw her to wherever he was . <p> After two weeks Cora went back to work . In her head she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serene on the floor of the bucket . Everyone had stopped calling by then , and now Cora , feeling unaccountably lost , began to call certain friends , hoping she could happen upon a definition of the melancholy that had begun to oppress her . But her friends were uneasy when she referred to her lost child . <p> " It was a fetus , " her best friend told her firmly . <p> " Well , you still have Chris , " another friend said . <p> Cora stopped reaching out . She looked up the word miscarriage in a thesaurus and found the words failure , malfunction and mismanagement . She began to think that she had sorely mismanaged her youth ; she had smoked too much dope and had neglected opportunities for spiritual growth , and so was not worthy of the soul that would have been her child . She did n't know how to say these things to Chris . He would think her melodramatic and would counsel her not to indulge in needless recrimination . She must accept what had happened and simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You play out the hand you 're dealt , " he often said , as if life were a game and events as random as a split deck of cards . Cora realized that she had no heart anymore for the game . The cards were strewn all around her , their burlesque pattern mocking her imitation of sanity , divining her bottomless pain . <p> On the Thursday morning that she had awoken in despair , she could feel the veils surrounding her more closely than they ever had . She knew there was no question of going to work , so she sat as motionless as fractured stone in the dark house . At nine o'clock she called in sick . Then she lay down on her bed and waited , waited numbly for the silken cloth to close over her , for the rich veils of grief to smother her and deliver her over to the other side . <p> But somewhere beyond the veils , sleep crept back in . Cora fell through fiercely swirling silk into dreams of a little brown child , breathless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and brows that swept gently together over the bridge of his nose . The child , a graceful , long-limbed boy , ran laughing among the veils , his wind-voice calling her name . Cora stood transfixed , unable to move forward , still fearing the heartbreak of hope . " Mama , " the child called and raised his arms . The paralysis lifted ; trancelike , Cora began to move toward the child , tentatively at first , then more swiftly , till her feet were running behind him as he darted through the veils . <p> When she awoke , it was evening . Chris was bending over her , his troubled eyes more familiar than they 'd ever been , and yet more strange . Chris stroked her forehead , placed a small kiss in the curve of her neck , then moved his lips to her ear . It took another moment for Cora to rise out of the trance of her dream , so she did n't hear what Chris whispered at first . But as she folded herself against him , as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll find our baby , " he had whispered . In that moment the veils parted and Cora understood . <p> Rosemarie Robotham is a New York-based writer and editor and the mother of a seven-month-old son . <p>
