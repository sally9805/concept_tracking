TITLE : PLEADING GUILTY <P> AUTHOR : SCOTT TUROW <P> PUBLISHER : FARRAR , STRAUS &; GIROUX ; 386 PAGES ; $24 <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : In this irresistible tale , Turow proves it is hard to catch a thief when nearly everyone seems suspect . <P> A slight , er , problem has cropped up at the large ( 68 partners ) law firm of Gage &; Griswell ; the Management Oversight Committee wonders if maybe McCormack A. ( " Mack " ) Malloy might not be able to help them solve it . Seems that Bert Kamin , like his friend Mack a partner at Gage &; Griswell , has disappeared , and so has about $5.6 million . The money was lifted from an account the firm had assembled to settle insurance claims against the fatal crash of a TransNational Air plane in 1985 . Since TN is by far the firm 's biggest and most lucrative account , the missing money could prove especially embarrassing ; evidence of embezzlement might prompt the airline 's executives to look elsewhere for legal help . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the money back ? <P> In other words , Scott Turow is about to condemn another summer 's worth of beachgoers to addictive page turning . <P> The setting is Kindle County , the imaginary Midwestern tract that also provided the Rust Belt backdrop for Turow 's first two best-selling novels , Presumed Innocent ( 1987 ) and The Burden of Proof ( 1990 ) . The moral climate remains much the same as in the earlier books : inducements to lie , cheat , steal , even kill , proliferate , while those in the legal profession  --  unsworn priests of the social order  --  struggle to sift right from wrong and to keep themselves , if possible , uncorrupted . <P> That is not easy for Mack Malloy , Turow 's most complex and problematic hero to date . Pushing 50 , Mack agrees to look for the missing partner because he fears his own high-paying job at Gage &; Griswell may be in jeopardy ; if he succeeds , he should be able to coast on his partners ' gratitude for a few more years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . And the job may distract him from the dreariness of his personal life : his recent divorce , his unruly adolescent son , the drinking problem he hopes he has solved by abstinence . <P> There is something else too . The idea that his friend Kamin has actually pulled off such a scam intrigues him : " What a notion ! Grabbing all that dough and hieing out for parts unknown . The wealth , the freedom , the chance to start anew ! I was n't sure if I was more shocked or thrilled . " <P> Needless to say  --  this is , after all , a Scott Turow novel  --  the matter of the purloined money proves to be far more complicated than Mack or his colleagues anticipated . Finding Kamin turns out to be the easy part ; the identity of the person who finally winds up with the millions remains perfectly hidden until almost the very end of the book .
