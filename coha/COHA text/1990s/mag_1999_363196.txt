In its first incarnation , this revue , mounted off-Broadway in 1993 , suffered from comparison with its predecessor , the plotless Side by Side by Sondheim , which was a joyful feast of the composer 's best songs . The successor ( with Julie Andrews and a mismatched company of four ) seemed to consist of leftovers garnished with Sondheim 's less nourishing material and served up thematically as an odd sort of cocktail party . This Broadway revise finds the party device strengthened , but still forced , and the selection of songs improved . The new cast , led by Carol Burnett with great warmth and good humor , is creamy . Yet this remains a chilly pudding of a show that leaves one admiring Sondheim 's artistry and the performers ' panache , but still hungry . <P>  --  By William Tynan
