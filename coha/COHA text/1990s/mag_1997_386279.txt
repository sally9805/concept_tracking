Dear Dr. Cory : In a recent letter , you answered a question about why you should drink more milk . I am lactose intolerant . What should I do so that I can get the nutrients I need since I am unable to drink milk ? Brittany Blackburn Minford , Ohio Dear Brittany : So that our readers will understand , we should explain lactose intolerance first . Lactose is the name for the natural sugar found in milk . People who are lactose intolerant do n't have the special enzyme in their stomachs needed to digest milk and other dairy products.This enzyme is called lactose . Normally , lactase is made in the small intestine . It breaks the natural sugar in milk into simpler forms so that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream.When there is a shortage of lactase , the milk sugar does not get broken down until it passes into the large intestine.There it is broken down by bacteria instead.This process produces fatty acids and gas . If the body can not get rid of these by-products , it develops gastrointestinal symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diarrhea . But not everyone who has a shortage of the enzyme lactase is completely lactose intolerant . Some are able to eat some dairy products and even drink a full glass of milk with meals . It 's when lactose-intolerant people eat too many dairy products for their large intestines to handle that the side effects begin . " Cultured " dairy products , such as yogurt , are easier for lactose-intolerant people to digest and are an excellent source of calcium . Cheese is also often easier to digest because much of the lactose is removed in the cheese-making process . Hard cheeses , such as Cheddar or Swiss , seem to cause the least side effects.There are also lactose-reduced or lactose-free products in your grocery store . If you can not tolerate any dairy products , make sure that you are still getting your calcium through other foods , such as tofu , calcium-fortified orange juice , salmon with bones , broccoli , kale , and sardines.You may also need to check with your doctor about taking a calcium supplement . Dear Dr. Cory : // Why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? Jennifer Moderie Seely Lake , Montana Dear Jennifer : Everyone has earwax . Some people have more than others . It is a normal and helpful part of the body . Earwax has chemicals in it that can help prevent infections . Along with tiny hairs inside the ear , earwax helps to keep dust away from the eardrum . It also protects the lining of the ear canal . The light brown , sticky substance is produced by a type of sweat gland in the ear . Every day or two , you may see a little earwax in the opening of the ear canal . It moves outward during chewing and during the normal growth of the ear canal lining . Then it usually rolls out on its own . Sometimes too much wax builds up inside the ear and hardens and blocks the canal . This can cause hearing problems.The wax needs to be removed by a doctor or nurse . Do n't damage your ear by poking objects into it . In fact , earwax buildup is commonly caused by using cotton swabs or hairpins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper into the ear . Dear Dr. Cory : // Why are some kids double-jointed and other kids not ? What does " double-jointed " mean ? I think that I am double-jointed . Clara Lubansky Queens , NewYork Dear Clara : // Joints are where two or more bones meet-like our knees , elbows , and knuckles . They allow us to make twisting and turning motions . " Double-jointed " people have the same number of joints as everyone else.They just have very loose and flexible ligaments that allow their joints to bend farther than other peoples ' or at unusual angles . ( Ligaments are strong , elastic-type bands of tissue that hold bones together at the joints . ) Sidebar Send your health questions to : " Ask Doctor Cory " Child Life , P.O.
