The Bay of Pigs operation was doomed by presidential indecisiveness and lack of commitment . <p> THIRTY-FIVE years ago , 1,500 exiled Cuban patriots landed on the south coast of their country , at the Bay of Pigs , in a gallant effort to free Cuba from Communist rule . They were abandoned on the beach without the supplies , protection , and support that had been promised by their sponsor , the Government of the United States . They had no chance of succeeding in their mission , and nearly all of them were captured or killed . <p> For 35 years , bound by my oath not to reveal classified information , I kept silent about the fatal errors in judgment that led to this disaster . Now this information is no longer classified , and I believe the facts should be reported . <p> My involvement with the Cuba Project began during the Eisenhower Administration . In late August of 1960 , the Commandant of the Marine Corps , General David Shoup , told me that the CIA had requested the services of a Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cuban exiles . I had the required experience in amphibious operations , and also in guerrilla warfare ( Philippines , 1943 ) , and so he was assigning me to the job . I reported to the CIA on September 1 . <p> At the CIA , I was assigned duty as Chief of the Paramilitary Staff of the Cuba Project , responsible directly to the Chief of the Cuba Project , Mr. Jacob Esterline . <p> I soon learned that the Cuba Project had been initiated by President Eisenhower in January 1960 , when it had become clear that Castro was a Communist bent not only on establishing a Communist state in Cuba but also on subverting other Latin American countries . President Eisenhower decided that Castro should be overthrown and directed the CIA to prepare plans to that end . <p> The concept of the operation , developed by the CIA before my arrival , involved training paramilitary teams of Cuban exiles to be introduced secretly back into their country for purposes of intelligence , sabotage , propaganda , and political and guerrilla activity . Each team would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was planned also to form a small infantry force of 200 to 300 men that could be sent in to augment guerrilla activity fostered by the teams . <p> The project was flawed from the outset owing to diplomatic/political considerations . The safest and most efficient venues for both training camps and bases of operations would have been in the United States or Puerto Rico . However , the CIA was anxious not to have the operation appear to be run by the United States , and so training camps and airfields were established in Guatemala and Nicaragua , at extremely unsuitable locations . The training camp in Guatemala was located on the side of a remote volcano with very little level ground . Conditions there were extremely crowded and became health-threatening as additional recruits arrived . And from the airfield in Nicaragua chosen for tactical air operations , Cuba was just barely within range of the B-26 bombers procured by the CIA for the exile air force . <p> If the Cuban forces had been trained here , they could have been ready for action months earlier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , the Soviet Union was pouring great quantities of arms and other materiel into Cuba , enabling Castro to organize and equip large militia forces and consolidate his security system for control of the Cuban people . In view of these rapidly growing capabilities , the Deputy Director for Plans at the CIA , Mr. Richard Bissell , decided that the planned infantry force of 200 to 300 would not be large enough ; more like 1,500 men would be needed to establish a serious presence in Cuba . I expressed reservations about a force this large in view of the increased difficulties in recruiting , training , and providing support . However , President Eisenhower directed that preparations be made for a larger force . <p> In late 1960 and early 1961 , teams of paramilitary agents were landed in many places on the Cuban coast . Most of the teams established radio communication with the CIA , but some were captured immediately and never heard from again . The surviving teams reported that there were large numbers of men in all provinces of Cuba who were willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to supply arms and ammunition to some of the teams by nocturnal parachute drops , but without success . The Cuban pilots were not experienced enough for these difficult missions , and our request for permission to use American contract pilots was denied , again so that the U.S. would not appear to be too deeply involved . The only sizable delivery of arms through the efforts of the agent teams was made by sea to a 400-man guerrilla unit operating in the Escambray mountains of central Cuba . About 1,000 guerrillas operated in this area in separate groups for many months . <p> Soon after President Kennedy 's inauguration , Mr. Bissell briefed him about the Cuba Project . The new President was interested and scheduled a series of meetings at the White House involving the Secretary of State , Mr. Dean Rusk ; the Secretary of Defense , Mr. Robert McNamara ; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Gen. Lyman Lemnitzer ; and Mr. Bissell . Each of these officials brought assistants to these meetings , and I usually accompanied Mr. Bissell . <p> President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a way that U.S. involvement could be plausibly deniable . ' This was the fundamental mistake underlying the other fatal errors that led to the failure of the operation . It should have been apparent to all concerned that the recruiting of large numbers of Cubans in Miami , followed by the landing of a well-armed Cuban exile force in Cuba with air support , would be attributed to the United States . If that was held to be unacceptable , the operation should have been canceled ; if it was not canceled , it should have received the support required for success . As it was , the Administration neither escaped blame nor succeeded in liberating Cuba . <p> THE crucial point at issue was air support . Throughout my participation in the Cuba Project , I frequently emphasized , both orally and in formal correspondence , the absolute necessity for complete destruction of the opposing air force at the outset of the operation . In January 1961 , in a memorandum to higher CIA authority , I recommended that the landing operation be canceled if sufficient air operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 1961 , I stated flatly that if Castro 's aircraft were not all destroyed before the troop transports arrived at the landing beaches , a military disaster would occur . An unarmed freighter can not approach a hostile shore , drop anchor , and unload troops , supplies , and equipment while under fighter and bomber attack . Mr. Rusk did not seem to grasp this point . At the White House meetings , it became clear that he was unalterably opposed to any air operations whatsoever . To my surprise and chagrin , neither Mr. McNamara nor Gen. Lemnitzer spoke up in these meetings in defense of the necessity of eliminating Castro 's air force completely by preliminary air strikes . And so , when the recommendations of the State Department conflicted with those of the CIA , the President usually adopted Mr. Rusk 's position . <p> Absolute control of the air was essential not only for the landing but also for further operations in Cuba . Our Cuban Brigade was small and could not be expected to undertake operations beyond its initial lodgement unless the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by defection to our side . Many of the militia were of dubious loyalty to Castro and might well have turned against him had this operation been properly launched . <p> As the spring of 1961 approached , the Brigade , now up to planned strength , and its supporting tactical air force of 16 B-26s were nearing readiness for combat . Commercial freighters were chartered for the operation , four for the assault phase and three for follow-on delivery of supplies . Meanwhile , the time element was becoming critical . The Soviet Union continued delivering arms and equipment to Cuba and was training jet pilots for Castro in Eastern Europe . Soon Castro would have a modern jet air force , and a paramilitary effort to overthrow him would have no chance of success . <p> After long study , the Paramilitary Staff had concluded that by far the best place , and probably the only place , where a successful landing ( i.e. , one likely to lead to the overthrow of Castro ) could be made was at Trinidad near the middle of the southern coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Escambray mountains , where , as noted above , anti-Castro guerrillas were already operating . The Brigade could quickly establish itself in these mountains and incorporate the guerrillas already there . <p> Trinidad itself had a population of about 18,000 , offering the possibility of recruiting additional volunteers . Our agent teams had informed us that most of the people in the area were opposed to Castro . <p> The Paramilitary Staff prepared a complete plan for the Trinidad operation , which was presented to the President and his advisors . Mr. Rusk strongly opposed the plan , saying that it was too much like an invasion and too easily attributable to the United States . He thought the Soviet Union might be provoked to the extent of taking action against the United States in Berlin or elsewhere in the world . <p> Once again , the President agreed with Mr. Rusk . He rejected the Trinidad plan and directed that a plan be developed that would be less noisy and less like an invasion . He also adopted the restriction advanced by Mr. Rusk that an airfield capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day so that all air operations could be attributed to that field . <p> This was the first fatal error made by President Kennedy : rejecting a plan that offered a good chance of success and placing plausible deniability ' ahead of military viability . <p> Pursuant to Mr. Bissell 's oral instructions to me , the Paramilitary Staff studied the entire coast of Cuba in an effort to find a landing area that would satisfy the President 's requirements . We found that the only place on the Cuban coast which did so and could be held even for a minimal time was at the Bahia de Cochinos ( Bay of Pigs ) . <p> I reported this orally to Mr. Bissell and briefly described the area . Behind the beach lay a long narrow strip of flat , scrub-covered land from three to six miles in depth and forty miles wide . This land was cut off from the interior by a great swamp , impassable except for three narrow causeways approaching the beach from the north and a coastal road from the east , all of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and on the other side of the swamp by Castro 's militia ) . <p> I pointed out to Mr. Bissell that the Brigade could hold on there for only a limited time and would have no hope of breaking out through the swamp and reaching guerrilla country in the Escambray mountains eighty miles away . However , since the Bay of Pigs was the only place that met the President 's requirements , Mr. Bissell decided on the spot that we would have to go ahead on that basis . This was another fatal error , as Mr. Bissell later acknowledged , lamenting that he had never informed the President that landing at the Bay of Pigs ruled out the possibility of guerrilla warfare in the Escambray mountains . Our plan for the Bay of Pigs landing provided for an attack on three Cuban military airfields by 16 B-26 bombers on April 15 , the landing itself during darkness in the early morning of April 17 , and a second 16-bomber attack against the military airfields at first light on April 17 . The President approved the plan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that he would not finally decide whether to execute the operation until 24 hours before it was scheduled to begin . <p> Not long after this , the Chief of the Cuba Project , Mr. Esterline , and I had a serious talk about the outlook for the Bay of Pigs operation and found ourselves in complete agreement that it was certain to fail . We went to Mr. Bissell at his home on a Sunday to attempt to dissuade him from continuing with the operation . We even went so far as to say that we did not want to be parties to the disaster we believed lay ahead . <p> Mr. Bissell tried to reassure us and implored us not to let him down . He said he thought he could persuade the President to permit an increase in our air capability to ensure destruction of Castro 's air force . But he gave no assurance about other weaknesses of the plan . <p> I thought that after hearing unequivocal predictions of complete disaster from his two principal staff officers who were most familiar with the military aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . It had become obvious that the military requirements for a successful operation and the President 's insistence on plausible deniability were in irreconcilable conflict . However , Mr. Bissell could not bring himself to give up on the plan . This was another fatal error . <p> On April 14 , devastating instructions came from the White House . The President informed Mr. Bissell that he wanted the number of participating aircraft reduced to the minimum . Mr. Bissell , without consulting Mr. Esterline or me , volunteered to cut the number by half , from 16 to 8  --  although 16 was considered the minimal number for destroying 18 opposing aircraft scattered on three different fields . The President accepted Mr. Bissell 's offer . Military failure was now virtually assured . <p> The attack was carried out the next morning with only eight B-26s , and our fears were confirmed when post-strike photography revealed that half of Castro 's military aircraft , including five fighters , had escaped destruction . These posed a deadly threat to the landing and to our B-26s as well . <p> News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , a leading figure in the Democratic Party , who had not been informed about the operation , denied U.S. involvement . When he learned the truth , he was outraged and protested to the President that this affair was extremely embarrassing both to the President and to him . He was reinforced in that position by Mr. Rusk . <p> This led the President to make another decision , which made disaster absolutely certain . I was in the CIA operations room at about 10 P.M. on April 16 , three hours before the troops were to commence landing , when Mr. Esterline hurried in with an ashen face and told me that the President had canceled the second attack on Castro 's air force , the one scheduled for first light the next morning . Appalled , I rushed to the telephone and called Mr. Bissell , who was at the State Department , and urged him in the strongest terms to call the President and explain that the invasion force faced certain destruction unless the order was reversed . I predicted that our troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be sunk . <p> After my plea , Mr. Bissell and General C. P. Cabell , the Deputy Director of the CIA , spoke to Mr. Rusk . He telephoned the President , who had left Washington , and told him that the CIA wanted to reinstate the air strike but that he believed the decision should not be changed . McGeorge Bundy , the National Security Advisor , seconded Mr. Rusk 's advice . The cancellation remained in effect . <p> This final incredible mistake doomed Brigade 2506 . The President himself had initially approved the original operation plan , which provided for forty B-26 sorties in preliminary air strikes . After his last-minute cuts , only eight sorties were flown , a reduction of 80 per cent . <p> While Washington floundered , the troops of Brigade 2506 landed successfully in darkness . But when morning came , Castro 's fighters and bombers attacked , and they continued to attack all day . Unloading supplies from the ships was impossible . Two ships were sunk , and the remaining two had to flee at top speed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not overrun or driven from its position . With their supply ships either sunk or chased away , the troops eventually ran out of ammunition and had to surrender . <p> During three days of combat , from 3,000 to 4,000 casualties were inflicted upon Castro 's hard-core militia , mostly by B-26 attacks on troop convoys . The hard-core militia , the only troops trusted by Castro , were limited in number and could not long have endured casualties of such magnitude . <p> Before the surrender , Admiral Arleigh 31-knot ' Burke , the Chief of Naval Operations , requested permission from the President to have carrier aircraft eliminate the rest of Castro 's air force and fly cover and support for the Brigade , and to use Navy landing craft to evacuate the troops from the beach . The President refused . <p> It was noteworthy that when the Brigade landed , the defending militia unit fought little and surrendered quickly . About 150 men were captured , and nearly all volunteered to join the Brigade and fight against Castro . Civilians in the landing area also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our concept of the operation had merit , and that , if the landing had been made at Trinidad as recommended , and with adequate air support , the objective of overthrowing the Communist government might well have been accomplished . <p> But , as things turned out , Brigade 2506 was left stranded on the beach , shamefully misled and betrayed by the Government of the United States . The last message from Jose Pepe ' San Roman , the Brigade Commander , was , How can you people do this to us ? ' <p> Less than four months into the Kennedy Administration , the Bay of Pigs fiasco caused the U.S. Government to be perceived as weak , irresolute , and inept . Undoubtedly , Chairman Khrushchev was reassured that he had little to fear from the United States as he pressed on with his plans to turn Cuba into a Soviet armed camp . <p> If those plans had been aborted at the outset , there would have been no missile crisis bringing us to the brink of nuclear war , and Cuba would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACK HAWKINS <p> <p> Jack Hawkins is a retired colonel in the United States Marine Corps . <p>
