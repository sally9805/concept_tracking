The Andersons ' house perched on the corner of our block like a dinosaur , with wings and a tail that spread into the lot behind it , growing in sections as the family increased . Mrs. Anderson had five children by her first husband , who died in bed of a heart attack the morning of their tenth anniversary . The couple had taken a trip to the Caribbean as a sort of second honeymoon , and to escape the Illinois winter . When Mrs. Anderson awoke one morning , she turned to her husband to embrace him . Feeling his inert body , she almost cried out for help . Then she had a vision of the dreary days ahead of her , the years with no one at her side , and she thought that perhaps she was wrong  --  he was n't dead after all . So she lay her head in the crook of his arm and treasured the scent of his body . Finally , at lunchtime , she rose and showered and dressed and called the hotel manager . <p> Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the neighborhood children , that except for her five babies , she would have thought her life had ended . Who could have known that she would meet Dr. Anderson , a man so beautiful , so loving and refined , and that he would have the power to resurrect her ? He came to her with three children of his own ; his wife had gone crazy , and the Catholic church agreed to annul his marriage so that he could marry Andrew Scannell 's widow . ( The annulment scandalized the Protestants on our street and provoked another round of stories about secret passageways between convents and monasteries , where the bones of babies fertilized the soil . ) The first three years of the Anderson marriage produced no children at all , and Mrs. Anderson said that it broke her heart to imagine she might never carry the child of this beloved husband . But then she had two more babies in a row , and one or the other was always riding on her hip . All the children from her first marriage had golden blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch-black . The two they produced together had nut-brown hair ; it was almost too neat to be believed . <p> Dr. Anderson , the object of all this affection , was the oddest man I had ever met . Something of a dandy , he combed his hair straight back from his narrow forehead and was only ever seen in checkered flannel suits . Every few minutes , he consulted a gold watch he kept in an inner pocket . He never said anything but always looked as if he were about to ask a question . Once , when <p> was sure a question was forthcoming , I said , " What is it , Dr. Anderson ? " and he said , " Nothing , nothing , " with a nervous turn of his head . He walked twice around the block after he got home every evening . He was so tall and thin , his shadow sliced across the street like a pencil or a knife . <p> The entire family adored him and stood in awe of his genius . Every night after dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked a passage , and he , seated at the head of the table , would read laboriously . When he was finished , Mrs. Anderson would say , " Thank you so much , " and the children would nod their heads at their father , as if he himself had written the psalms . Then he would retire to his study . Once , I sneaked into this study and discovered , in his bottom drawer , a Penthouse and a bag of jelly beans . <p> I was part of a neighborhood gang that included Sally , Dr. Anderson 's daughter ; Christa , from Mrs. Anderson 's first marriage ; and Sam Button and Jack Cartwright , boys from down the street whom we sometimes fought and sometimes kissed . My sister , Anna , tagged along when I could n't shake her off . There were other kids , too , and although every fall we were buttoned and scarfed and sent to separate schools , every summer we reassembled our motley group , various in height and age and wit . Evenings , we congregated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were preordained . Our games of baseball and " Mother May I " began and ended inconspicuously , with little discussion and no fuss . Always there was the sense of possibility  --  of what we might do if an adventurous mood overtook us . We encouraged the traits we knew each other by ; Jack was a generous show-off , I was bossy and gregarious , Christa was whimsical and stubborn , Sam was fat and cunning . Sometimes a week would pass without our seeing each other , but we would come together again , and take up where we had left off . We were like a family of our own ; sometimes I imagined I would marry Jack , and we would have babies together . <p> The Andersons ' house was open to us , as it was to any children . Train sets , art projects , and half-finished jigsaw puzzles covered their living room floor . There was a drawer in the kitchen for us to rummage in , stocked with peanuts and raisins and potato chips . In spite of a three-car garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because one of the boys raised chickens and used the garage as a coop . <p> Mrs. Anderson had an otherworldly quality which dignified the confusion of her household . Utterly occupied with cleaning , cooking , and caring for children , she had the air of understanding a larger significance for all her undertakings , so much so that , watching her shake out her linen and pin it on the line , I half expected her to levitate , to lift off with a breeze into the sky . Her spiritual air enhanced her maternal authority , and it was to visit her as much as her offspring that we came knocking at the door . Aware of this , she would say to one fortunate soul , " Darling , would you be so good as to help me grate the carrots ? " If you were chosen , you would follow her , the kitchen door rocking into place behind you . She would set you up with carrots and a grater or cereal to feed one of the babies . As she moved about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you confided the secrets of your heart : how jealous you were of your baby sister , that you 'd cheated on a science test at school . As you spoke , you felt yourself relaxing , and it slowly became clear what course of action you should take . I do n't know what gave her the mysterious power of absolution ; perhaps as you sat there in that kitchen chair , aware of your friends who had sat there before you and would sit there again , you began to see that what you faced were the customary hurdles , and your pain no longer seemed so personal . When you finished talking , she would reassure you , " I wo n't tell anyone . Except Dr. Anderson , of course . I share everything with him . " I did n't mind if the two of them shared my secrets . Odd as he was , I was fond of Dr. Anderson ; unlike my own father , who terrorized my family with bouts of violence , he seemed harmless enough . <p> I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I suspected that she secretly disapproved of me , that my confessions were not of the sort to stir her generosity . Whenever I visited her house , I felt the lure of that paneled kitchen , the smell of chicken stew , a baby groggy in the high chair . More often than not , my reserve would melt away , and I would slip in to visit her . Spurred on by a perverse instinct , I would relate the sins I imagined she would least like to hear  --  how I mocked Mr. Gregory , my history teacher , whenever he turned his back , how the class laughed until his ears turned red  --  until I 'd convinced us both of my spitefulness . That night I would sleep fitfully , for the worst of it was that I longed for Mrs. Anderson 's approval . I would return to her house the following day , determined to talk myself out of my ill position , but something would come over me , and instead of referring to Mr. Gregory 's vast store of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing how his voice squeaked out of his ears . <p> Jack Cartwright was in love with Mrs. Anderson . Before ringing her bell , he combed his hair and tucked in his T-shirt ; after peeing at her house , he lowered the toilet seat . He made the rest of us shut up while the babies took their naps , though our silence worried them more than our noise . When Sally Anderson opened the door to Jack , she 'd run her hand down her black ponytail and say , " Oh , look , it 's Joseph come to visit the Virgin Mary , " but neither she nor I could ruffle him nor disturb his sense of sacred mission . Inside , he was a pilgrim ; outside , he swore and sneered like the rest of us . <p> Jack transferred some of his ardor to Mrs. Anderson 's oldest daughter , who lived at home and attended a two-year Catholic college . Then one May morning , Maria held up a finger decorated with a small but glistening stone and announced her engagement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Andersons ' living room became a sewing center as mother and daughter hovered over folds of lace and chenille . Jack had to watch as Maria grew more pink and breathless every day with love for another man . A mere eight years his senior , now she , too , was slipping from his grasp . To top it off , Mrs. Anderson neglected him , occupied with the transformation her daughter was about to undergo , from Maria to Mrs. White . <p> Even Mrs. Anderson was flustered that summer . Maria was her first child , the daughter she and Andrew had cherished , and she wished she could impart to her what she had learned in all her years of marriage . Maria 's naivete touched her . She longed to preserve her innocence , to wish upon her an idyll of married life . Yet she had to relinquish her to the painful accretion of experience . <p> Maria , moved by her mother 's turmoil , watched her with new appreciation . Once , when both babies were whining and the teapot screamed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you do it ? " Mrs. Anderson grasped Maria 's hands , and tears came to her eyes . " Sweetheart , " she said , her voice wrinkling with emotion , " you 'll do it , too ! You 'll grow as your duties grow , and you 'll get pleasure , such pleasure from your husband and children . ' <p> I hovered at the borders of these scenes , taking it all in . Maria was the oldest among us , and I looked to her for dues about my fate . Mrs. Anderson could see this , and she encouraged me  --  she even let me help her pin the wedding dress . She said you never knew , maybe somewhere in the wedding party would be a boy who would grow into the man who would answer my dreams . I did n't tell her about my fears that something terrible would happen the day of the wedding : an uninvited aunt materializing out of an explosion of dust , hurling a curse on the bride and groom . I was also terrified that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarantined . Every morning , I stood in front of the mirror and searched for little red spots . Sometimes I imagined the boy I would marry looking in the mirror , too . <p> One evening Maria brought her fiance back to the house , and Dr. Anderson brought out a bottle of champagne . He must have drunk a little something before the celebration , because after he toasted Maria and Frank , he kissed all the girls in the room , and Mrs. Anderson forced a laugh . When it came my turn , he stuck his whole tongue in my mouth . It felt like a mouse trying to get down my throat , and I tried to pull back , but he wrenched me closer . I think he did the same thing to Christa , because she , too , tried to jerk away . But her mother shot her a look that said " Do n't make a scene , " Frank said , " You think I 'm not a fast learner ? " He emptied his glass , and he , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to Christa that I thought the kissing was pretty gross . She glanced at me as if she could not believe what I had said , as if I were vulgar beyond belief . Her pretty , oily skin turned red , and she said , " God , what 's the big deal ? " And so I dropped the subject , but I wondered what else she had to put up with in that household , in the name of not making a scene . <p> The wedding was set for the fifteenth of July . As the date approached , we watched for signs of rain . The reception would be in the Andersons ' backyard , manicured that summer like never before . Sculpted shrubbery and potted flowers awaited the appointed day , while sprinklers spun arms of water as far as they could reach . Frank flew to California the week before the ceremony ; a great-aunt had left him some property there , and he wanted to sell it and be free of the responsibility . He said his great-aunt was the meanest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to be reminded of her . He said she was a shriveled-up old spinster who needed a fuck , only she was so ugly no man could ever get his rocks off . <p> Maria blushed when he talked like that . Already thin , she grew waif-like in those final days . She made all of us nervous as she pined away , waiting for her love 's return . <p> Because of the commotion at the house , the older Anderson kids found themselves on a new leash of freedom that summer , and Sally and Christa took to sleeping in the treehouse at the bottom of their property . They cushioned the floor with sleeping bags bought at the army surplus and stored their drinking water in 7-Up bottles . If they had to pee in the middle of the night , they went in a tennis ball can . The treehouse hung in a branching oak on the lower slope of a ravine , the site of our happiest childhood play . There was a ditch at the bottom that flooded up to our waists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we put on rain gear , pulled old washtubs out of the cellar , and went rafting down the ditch , using broken tree limbs to guide us . In winter we 'd toboggan down the slope . On the other side of the ravine , there used to be a cornfield where we played cops and robbers , sliding on our bellies through the dirt , trying to stalk like Blackhawk Indians , without rustling the corn . <p> Now a line of identical colonial houses hung on that slope , part of a new development called Hillcrest . The tree line had become strangely regular . The whole row of houses seemed hardly deeper than a stage set , presided over by telephone poles with endless parallel wires . I could n't believe that real people lived in those houses , but Sally said Maria might move into that development . <p> The week before the wedding , I wanted to join Sally and Christa in the treehouse . We planned to get Sam and Jack to camp out , too , and for all of us to sneak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . <p> My mother 's permission was never a problem . I waited until she lay down after lunch and gave her a kiss , her lips cool and minty from the gin-soaked ice cube she 'd been sucking . " Do as you like , " she said to me , with a weak pat on my behind . " You 're a good girl , Maggie . " <p> " Such a good girl , " I teased . I fiddled with her fingers . <p> " You are , " she said , shutting her eyelids . Her skin was like mine : so thin you could see the blue underneath . She added , " I 've never had to worry about you . " <p> I bent to kiss her again , but she was already asleep . She lay there with her mouth slightly open , her arms winding down to little wrists . I shook out an afghan to cover her , raising a cloud of cat hair . My mother was allergic to cats , but that did n't stop her from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kissed her on the forehead . Her skin felt so cool that I looked around for another cover , but there was only the one afghan . <p> I found my father in his den in his leather chair , smoking a Camel and reading the Sunday paper , his cowboy boots propped on the table . Though last year he had built us a nice sun deck , he preferred to sit alone in his musty room , in the company of the stuffed bear head on the wall , its red tongue and toothy snarl . <p> low-watt lamp sent his shadow sprawling over the carpet . I hesitated at the door . <p> " It 's okay by me , " he answered amiably enough , when I had made my request . " If you take Anna with you , and your mother agrees He always verbally deferred to my mother , the more so now that my mother spent her afternoons on the couch . But we knew better than to bypass his permission . <p> " Thanks , Pa , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped back automatically , quicker than him by now . He liked it best when I called him " Pa . " But I would n't go so far as to play the tickling game . That game belonged to the past . <p> My father meant for Anna to serve as our moral guardian , for she could be counted on to report violations to the nearest adult in sight . When Sally heard about this problem , she took the situation into her own hands . From the moment we pushed our sleeping bags up through the trapdoor of the treehouse , she fussed over Anna like she 'd just discovered her . <p> " What a nice bag , " she said . It was orange and blue and rolled up like a snail , a wormy head poking out the end . I had just told Anna how revolting it was . <p> She beamed up at Sally . " You get them at the Globe Store . They come with six Richie Rich comic books . " <p> Sally kissed it on the nose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The oak trunk ran through the middle of the treehouse , which was just wide enough for a sleeping bag to fit along each of the four screened walls . I put the head of my bag next to Sally 's , clearing a space to roll it out . <p> Anna began to whimper . " I was going to sleep there , " she said , rubbing her nose . She looked like she was about to fall asleep that second , but that was nothing new for her . She liked to get her fourteen hours a night , and sometimes she napped in the afternoon as well . She was so greedy for sleep , I was sure when I had insomnia , it was because she had taken my share . <p> " Shut up , Anna , " I said . <p> " I had my bag there first . I do n't want to sleep over the trapdoor . " <p> Sally popped a Sweet Tart into her mouth and held out a fistful to Anna . Anna sniffled and plucked out the mint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's room over here by me . " <p> I did n't treasure the prospect of Anna 's smelly little breath next to my head all night , and I thought that Sally was laying it on too thick , but by the time we got around to revealing our plans , Anna was completely won over ; her eyes fairly gleamed with the excitement of being included . I had to hand it to Sally : she had mastered her stepmother 's techniques and learned to apply them to her own ends . <p> After dinner , when it began to get dark , the four of us gathered to catch lightning bugs . They were easy targets , spotting the ravine with light . If you stood at the top of the slope and ran down the hill with your arms at your sides , like a swooping bird , you could catch them in your hands without even trying . Then you let them rattle around inside your fist . If you dug out the light-maker with your thumbnail just as the bug lit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each fingernail and waved our glittering hands through the dark . " We 're society ladies , " said Sally . Christa studded a string of the lighters around her neck , making a brilliant choker , and the rest of us copied her . As it grew later , our features dissolved until we could n't see each other at all , but only the light-beads , glowing chains floating through the night four feet off the ground . <p> We climbed up into the treehouse and lay on our bellies in the sleeping bags , our newly sensitive breasts pressed into the plank floor . The crickets ticked away , reek , reek , reek . I stuck my face up to the screen and looked at the world through the miniscule squares of netting . A light breeze swished the leaves ; we were up in the tree world , up with the squirrels and the birds . Christa let a fart , and all of us giggled . Sally tried to let a bigger one , but she only made a squeak , and that made us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sally passed around a bag of red licorice , which we chewed on as the lights went off along the hill and the neighborhood sank into sleep . As soon as it was safe , Jack would come with Sam . <p> " This licorice reminds me of something , " said Sally . " Christa started her period last week . " She and I giggled , but my heart jumped inside me . Christa was only ten  --  two years younger than Sally and me  --  and she was the first to start . <p> " Shut up , " said Christa . " You 're gross . " <p> " Not as gross as Billy Shawgo , " said Sally . " Someone told Billy that Christa had started , and when we were walking home from Mr. Fresh , Billy and Sam were right behind us , and Billy said , ' Christa , you 're looking really ripe . Mmm , you 're looking like <p> cherry tart . ' " <p> " I was so embarrassed , " said Christa . <p> Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going ? " I asked . " I mean , are you still bleeding ? " <p> " Gross , no , " said Christa . " It only lasted a couple days . But Mom said they 'll get longer . " <p> " What are you using for it ? " <p> " Pads . Mom gave me pads . " <p> " Yeah , " said Sally , " and she left a bloody one in the wastebasket and Mom had a fit . " <p> " What are you supposed to do ? " I asked . <p> " Wrap it up , " said Christa . " Stick it in a box . I do n't know , but keep it out of sight . " <p> We contemplated this for a while . <p> " You know what else ? " said Sally . " I think Jack is getting a crush on Christa . Now that she 's a woman , I mean . " <p> " Shut up , " said Christa . <p> I said , " You 're crazy , Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so leave her alone . " <p> Sally was twirling her ponytail around her wrist . " What are you so touchy about ? " she said . " Do n't tell me you have the hots for Jack . " <p> I said , " That 'll be the day , " but I was glad it was dark and she could n't see me . <p> " Shh , " said Sally . " Listen . " <p> There was a rustle in the bushes . <p> Christa whispered furiously , " How long have they been there ? " <p> " Shh , " said Sally . <p> It was n't Sam and Jack . The noise came from up the hill , and it was female voices : Maria and Mrs. Anderson walking in the garden . The night was still enough that we could almost make out what they were saying . Mrs. Anderson 's voice was low and purposeful ; Maria 's sounded excited . The two women talked for a long : time , their voices dipping and rising , falling to a murmur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a circle around the yard , and when they approached the corner nearest us , where , with the moon 's illumination , we saw them emerge from the line of rhododendrons , Maria started crying . She was wearing a white blouse that caught the light ; the rest of her receded in the dusk , but the blouse shook and trembled and swayed : for a moment I thought it was a ghost . The cries were silent at first , just breaking through the crickets , but they kept on building until Maria could n't support herself , and she fell to the grass , out of our view . " He does n't love me , " she was saying . " He does n't love me , Mother . " <p> Mrs. Anderson dropped down , too , and then we saw nothing , just the line of rhododendrons and the neighbor cat slipping into the bushes . Then the two heads appeared again , Maria 's blond one drooping on her Mrs. Anderson made her stand up straight and continue walking . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripping her arm above the elbow and proceeding around the path . Finally , the porch door snapped behind them . <p> In the treehouse , all of us lay still . Nobody sighed ; nobody whispered . I turned my face to the trunk of the oak tree and studied the dents and ledges , the dark , dark bark that got even darker in the rain . We were all perfectly quiet . As far as I could tell , no one was even breathing . <p> I woke up to Jack 's low whistle and a pebble glancing off the screen . The next stone came harder ; it split right through a tear in the screen and ricocheted off the trunk . <p> " Jesus , " said Sally . <p> I pulled my sneakers on and followed Christa down the ladder . Anna was snoring in a little ball and grinding her teeth ; I was all for letting her sleep through our escapade , but Sally said if she woke up while we were gone , she 'd tell on us for sure . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treehouse like a sleepwalker , up the hill and into the cobble street . Jack and Sam went ahead of us , veering away from each other then back together again , grinning , kicking a piece of concrete chipped off from the curb . <p> I caught up to them . " Jack , " I whispered . " What 's the plan ? " He had a bag slung over his shoulder , carrying something heavy . He shrugged , feigning nonchalance , but I could read excitement in his features ; the soft pug nose , the lively forehead , expressed a barely suppressed hilarity that often spurred me on to acts of daring . I wrapped my palms around the smooth eggs I 'd hidden in my pockets , and squeezed them as hard as I dared . <p> The streets were empty . The houses looked remarkably tame , moonlight yellowing the cropped grass , cars sleeping in the driveways . We passed Colonials , a Dutch-like brick , a modern ranch . We knew most of our neighbors by name , but now they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gowns , an anonymous crew of sleepers  --  dentists and secretaries and housewives and accountants who would , when their alarm clocks rang , plug back into their lives . Yet if any one of them woke up now , the trouble they would cause ! Walking through the neighborhood , we felt an odd exhilaration ; we were a tribe apart , and we had tricks up our sleeves . <p> Christa did a cartwheel in the middle of the street , showing off . Next she tried a back walkover , but she was hampered by several rolls of toilet paper under her T-shirt , which was tucked into her cutoffs . Jack veered close to her and punched at the false paunch . " Do n't hurt my little baby , " she said . <p> " Leave her alone , " I said . I hated it when he got rough  --  it made me want to sock him . <p> He scowled at me . <p> " I mean it , " I said . " Just do n't be an asshole , Jack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch , Mother . " <p> We entered Valley Court , which sloped down and around a gentle hill , lined with newish houses . We were looking for the perfect target : a place isolated enough to provide protection , but close to the road so we could get away fast if we had to . <p> One lot in the development was still open ; Christa took out the toilet paper and began to wrap around a tree . Jack took the roll from her and looped it around another low-hanging branch . Sally scrambled up a little maple ; she had acrobatic talent , too , and she did a little tree dance . She twisted the toilet paper through the upper branches with her long arms , her long , lean torso stretching , her ponytail swishing on her shoulders . Anna looked on with stupefaction , and I grinned to myself : my little sister could n't back out now . Sam was too lazy to help , but he stood by Anna , nodding his appreciation . " This neighborhood will wipe its ass for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We wove a maze of white , and when Sally got down out of the trees , she and I wrapped Christa up in toilet paper , too , with several long tails streaming out behind , like the train of a wedding gown . " Here comes the bride , " we sang , as she paraded through the makeshift cathedral . Suddenly Jack lunged like a bear out of the shadows , grabbed Christa by the shoulders , and kissed her hard on the mouth . <p> " Gross ! " she spluttered , pushing him away . Anna was grinning like an idiot . Jack lunged at Christa again , only this time she tried to fight him off . When he tackled her to the ground , Sally and <p> came running to help . We each took a boot and started pulling him off of her . He giggled madly and grabbed at Christa 's hair . She screamed . A shot of fear went through me . I dropped Jack 's leg and unpeeled his hand while Sally pulled him away . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rubbed her scalp , scowling . <p> " It 's not funny , " I said to Jack . My heart was still pounding hard . <p> Sally said , " You did n't have to scream , Christa , " She looked past the lot at the low-lying houses , where no lights , at least , had come on . " We 'd better get out of here . " <p> " You try talking politely when he 's pulling your hair , " said Christa . <p> " Wedding celebration , " said Jack , and as if nothing had happened , he went to his bag and pulled out a jackknife and a Pepsi bottle , only the bottle was half-filled with a clear liquid . He used the tip of the knife to knock the cap off of the bottle , raised it to his lips , and choked . I did n't need to taste it to know that it was gin . He passed it around to all of us . I let it wash around my mouth until my head filled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack 's face . From the hurt look in his eyes , once he dried them off , you 'd have thought he 'd offered me his kingdom and I 'd scorned it . <p> Wordlessly , I headed for the street . Everyone followed me but Jack . A few steps on , I turned to wait , but Jack was headed in the other direction . <p> Sally touched me on the arm . " Let him go , " she said . <p> " That 's right , " I said . " We 're better off . " <p> We were quiet now , following the curve of the road . Each footstep made a skidding noise against the pavement . All thoughts slipped from my mind , and I let the night seep into my skin , the smell of grass giving up its store of heat , the distant barking of a dog , the resting cars , the shimmering pool of light beneath the corner streetlight . I would have liked living at night forever , sleeping out the day and coming alive when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no clear rules for how to be ; you had to make it up . People did n't go to school or to the bank in the middle of the night ; they did n't get married then , either . In the nighttime , people loved and hated and kissed and fought ; they robbed grocery stores and started revolutions . All the real stuff happened in the dead of night . <p> We 'd walked in a loop around the town , and now we were heading into Hillcrest . At the bend of the road was a pale green house with a pale green car in the yard . It belonged to a family by the name of Hedquist ; Kim and Nancy went to the Catholic school with Sally and Christa ; Mrs. Hedquist and Mrs. Anderson were friendly . I did n't know them well ; I only knew that the two girls were tall and overweight , and they dressed alike in frilly clothes that their mother sewed . The shrubs in their yard were perfectly trimmed . The grass was level ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole place was spic and span , as if awaiting some pathetic version of a stately visit  --  some knight come to court the princess daughters . <p> As I stared at that house , a kind of disgust came over me and filled me with a sense of purpose . <p> " Let 's hit it , " I said . We stood in a group in the middle of the road , our arms dangling loosely at our sides . When we were quiet like this , I could hear each person breathing : Sam in his wheezy asthmatic spurts ; Christa emphatically , as if with each breath she were making a statement ; Sally in measured , careful time ; Anna trying to hold it in . <p> Christa pulled down on the legs of her jean shorts  --  her hips were getting wider and the jeans kept shifting up . " No way , " she said . " We 'll get caught . " <p> " You 're crazy , " said Sam . <p> It was true that this house lacked all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window inspired me with hatred , and I wanted to strike now . <p> " Mrs. Hedquist has been to our house , " protested Sally . <p> I was silent . <p> She tried again . " They go to church with us . We go to catechism with their kids . " <p> " It 's the perfect target , " I said . <p> One thing I liked about Sally was that she knew when to give up . She and I had four eggs between us ; we gave one to Christa and one to Sam , and we all took cover behind trees in the opposite lot . Sam went first . He ran into the Hedquists ' yard and pitched his egg at the window . He had the pleasure of being the first to spoil its pristine look and also the knowledge that the Hedquists were unlikely to jump from their beds before he made it back to his tree . Christa ran next , but she stopped short in the middle of the street . She threw with admirable force ; her yolk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran out next , and Sally followed right behind me . We threw our eggs together , and they hit at the same time . The noise startled us ; we looked at each other with mutual fright and ran back down the street . The other three fled from their trees to follow us . Sam was so heavy , he waddled when he ran , but I never saw a waddler move so fast . He headed straight for his basement door and disappeared like a possum into its hole . The rest of us monkeyed into the treehouse and , in spite of our excitement , fell asleep . We did n't wake up until ten o'clock the next morning . <p> It had been a beautiful sight , the four eggs dribbling down the picture window , the splattered shells sticking for a moment then slipping into the bushes . What started out as a little adventure became an obsession with me . I could n't get the Hedquists out of my mind , and the more I thought of them , the more I hated them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces , pursed in disapproval . I thought of the reticent parents and their moral outrage when faced with their bespattered house . I thought of Nancy and Kim growing up and marrying men like their father and producing more overweight Nancys and Kims . I pictured them at a double wedding , in fussy white dresses that their mother sewed , and everyone beaming at them . Nine months later they 'd be pregnant and cow-like , and they 'd think they were in heaven . I made a trip to the grocery store and bought a whole carton of eggs . <p> Anna found them in the corner of the treehouse , tucked under my sleeping bag . Her eyes grew wide , and for once , I thought , she looked fully awake . <p> " Where are we going tonight ? " she asked . <p> I could n't help smiling . " I 'm going to the Hedquists ' . You might not want to come . " <p> Anna considered this , looking no more shocked than if the eggs were for french toast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze . Sally and Christa had refused to hit the same house twice  --  especially the Hedquists I was alone in this . <p> Anna said , " I 'll go . And Sam will come , too . " <p> That night , Anna and I climbed over two sleeping bodies when Sam gave us his call . <p> Each of us took two eggs , one to a palm . Sam and Anna lagged behind me , and none of us talked . We walked straight to the lot across from the Hedquist house . Their window was wiped clean . We took up our positions . <p> Tonight was a big occasion for Anna  --  her first shot  --  and she ventured out ahead of Sam and me . She was so afraid of missing the window that she ran up within a few yards of it . Even then , her egg crashed on the sill . She slipped in the grass trying to run back fast . Sam and I bent over to keep from laughing out loud . Embarrassed but grinning , she resumed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots , and we ran back home again . <p> I walked by the Hedquist house at noon the next day , and already the window was scraped dean . You 'd have thought there had never been a moment 's trouble there : no nasty eggs , no vandalism , nothing but two proud parents and two sweet girls in matching dresses . <p> That night , I left the treehouse with all the remaining eggs , six smooth weapons in a jacket pocket . I meant to go alone , but Anna followed me , inspired by a strange new fidelity . The house was dark as we approached ; each night , it had looked exactly the same , the pale green split-level home , no hint of the sleepers within . But this time , as I reached the curb in front of the yard , a light went on , and a man 's deep voice hollered . My knees went loose . Anna started running . I took an egg from my pocket and ran forward to pitch it , a murderous fastball . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I kept my eyes on the pavement as it flowed beneath me , like water slipping under a boat . My skin stung as I imagined falling forward , banging my head on the concrete , stripping the skin off my cheeks and hands . When I reached a garage around the corner , I hid behind it and peeked back . There were people in the yard , angry voices , but they were n't following me . I caught my breath and ran back to the treehouse . Anna was in her bag , her eyes open , clutching the zippered corner . I tried to look casual , but my hands shook , and I shivered as if I were cold . <p> Soon enough , my father appeared at the top of the hill . You might have thought he was a tree trunk lopped off at a strange height , he looked so thick and dark . " Maggie , " he called . His voice was soft  --  he did n't want to wake the neighbors  --  but he was angry . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christa were awake now . They lay still and passive as I crawled over them , climbed down the ladder , and walked up the hill to the line of rhododendrons where my father stood . He opened and closed his fists . His eyes jerked in his head . <p> I said weakly , " Sorry , Pa , " and my knees buckled . I tried to skirt around him . <p> The snag in my walk must have got to him . His leg shot out , and his boot was in my stomach , knocking the wind out of me . I fell , and before I even caught my breath , I tried to crawl away , but his leg shot out and took me to the ground again . My mouth filled with grass and the toothy taste of blood . One more time <p> raised my knee to my chest and tried to get up . Then all I could see was his boots , the cowboy boots he put on after work , the ones with the pointed toes and the swirls etched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have seen his boots , for his kicks were aimed at my stomach and my back , as he rolled me over and over . <p> I did n't cry ; I knew that would infuriate him . And yet , as he came toward me again , I heard gasps and sobs . Could I be crying after all ? Or were the sounds from farther off ! Of course , I thought  --  they watched from the treehouse , and Anna , she was crying . <p> My father whispered , " Get back to the house . " <p> I could feel him behind my back , the way I always felt my father , a shadow looming after me , even when he was n't there . I crawled a little farther , and then I got up and ran . <p> I missed the wedding two days later because I was grounded for three weeks . By all accounts the bride was ravishing , the weather could n't have been more perfect , the wedding just gorgeous . My mother brought me back a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with joy . She said the Hedquist family also attended the wedding , and she was ashamed to see them there . My father said he still could n't believe I would do such <p> thing , and three times in a row . What kind of woman would I grow up to be ? Anna told me all the good stuff , how the hens in the garage started squawking whenever the music started up , and a squealing cat nearly tripped the groom , and Jack got blitzed by draining the last drops of champagne from a hundred glasses . Maria herself could hardly walk , she was so far gone . " Too bad you could n't be there , " she said . <p> She had brought a tray of cookies and chocolate milk up to the room we shared . Downstairs , no doubt , my mother was pouring her afternoon gin . My father would be settling back into his den , smoking a Camel . Mrs. Anderson would be tucking the babies in for a nap while Dr. Anderson slobbered over the very last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tornado in the glass . <p> Anna went to the window , pulled up the screen , and leaned halfway out . Her blond head caught the sun . " You getting bored up here ? " she asked . <p> " The wallpaper 's giving me a headache . " <p> " You chose it . " <p> The bright yellow flowers and pink bows had seemed cheerful and sweet , but now the walls looked like a slaughter of canaries . <p> Anna leaned farther out the window . " I do n't know how you could sneak out of here , " she said . " Unless you pulled a Rapunzel . " <p> I stuffed a cookie in my mouth and leaned out the window next to her . Down at the Andersons ' corner , streams of toilet paper littered the grass . Someone must have wrapped up the newlyweds ' car . <p> " Screw Rapunzel , " I said . " I 'd rather fly out of here on a broomstick . " <p> I 'd fly to a city well beyond these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray spires and steamy streets , with angry posters being slapped on walls , excited crowds gathering in public places , and in the air , circling all around , hundreds of other witches . <p>
