Two weeks into the new school year , fourth-grader Scott Salas came home in tears . He had forgotten to write his name on a homework assignment , and his teacher had refused to accept the work-scolding Scott in front of the entire class . " My husband and I were furious , " recalls Linda Salas , of El Ceritos , CA . They called to set up an appointment with the teacher , and their anger had n't diminished much by the time they arrived for the meeting . Predictably , things got off to a rocky start . " Everyone was on the defensive , " Salas says . But after some tense conversation , the teacher explained that she felt it was extremely important for fourth graders to learn to follow instructions-a point of view that made sense to Scott 's parents . Scott never forgot to put his name on his homework again , and his mother was able to forge a civil relationship with the teacher after the dust had settled . " It was important to keep the conversation going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids , you ca n't just walk away . " Good parent-teacher communication has been linked to stronger student performance-higher grades and test scores , better attendance , and more positive attitudes about school . No matter how difficult the situation , the right approach can help you to make your child 's teacher an ally rather than an adversary . Here , the best ways to handle some of your common concerns . SITUATION : I want to make sure my child 's teacher gives her the attention she needs . SOLUTION : It 's important to talk to the teacher early on . But do n't make the mistake of trying to engage her in conversation at the beginning or end of the school day , when she 's trying to corral a room full of children . Instead , ask her to give you a call when she has time . Then keep the conversation short , ten minutes or less . That 's enough time for you to get a sense of the teacher 's style-what she emphasizes , what kind of disciplinarian she is-and for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finish your conversation by letting the teacher know you 're eager to hear from her throughout the term . And drive home your point hy sending the teacher your home and work phone numbers with convenient calling times . SITUATION : Walking into a classroom makes me feel like a little kid . I freeze up and ca n't tell the teacher what 's on my mind . SOLUTION : You 'll feel more selfassured if you make a list ahead of time about what you want to discuss , says Marsha Levy-Warren , Ph.D. , associate director of the Institute for Child , Adolescent , and Family Studies in New York City . Start by making a special point of asking your child what she 's concerned about . " Voicing your child 's concerns as well as your own will make you feel more like an advocate , which should decrease anxiety , " says Levy-Warren . If you 're going with your husband , decide which of you will bring up specific topics , she suggests . If one parent is more anxious or emotional , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also consider whether one of you is more knowledgeable about a specific area . Finally , before you walk into the classroom , remind yourself that " when it comes to your child , you 're every bit as much an expert as the teacher , " says Levy-Warren. ( tonlinued on page 62 ) SITUATION : I 've noticed my son 's grades slipping-on tests and homework assignments-and I do n't know xv why . SOLUTION. : Grades drop for aI variety of reasons-the distraction of basketball season , for example , or a problem at home . It could be just a momentary blip It if your instincts tell you something is tip , do n't wait for the next report card . Call the teacher to set up an appointment . When you sit down to talk , remember that it 's key to pinpoint the cause before trying to solve the problcm . And be wary of jumping in too ( quickly with your own opinions . L , et the teacher tell you her iml ) rcssions first . Ask her to explain any tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with his class Pose a few qiestions : " Why do you think his grades are filling ? " " . Is he not doing the work ? " " Is he being careless ? " I , isten for subtle messages ; your goal is to get the teacher to tell you what she really thinks is going on . When you 're ready for solutions , ask the teacher for both at-school and at-home strategies . If you suspect her classroom methods are n't meshing with your child 's learning style , bring it up politely but clearly . For example : " Susan seems to learn best when she works on her own with her math workbhok . ( Could you incllde that in her learning ? " Be sure to find out when the teacher expects results and how you 'll know whether the strategies are working . Give the plan a month to get up and running , then telephone every two weeks until you see a definite improvement . SITUATION:TI he teacher seems to be picking on my child .

" ( ' ' , all the teacher and get the other side of the story . " I'Iake a deep breath , and try to remain calm . Rage only fuels hostility , and you want to communicate in a way that will make things better . For example , say , " Jennifer came home upset about an incident she says happened in school . What can you tell me ? " If the teacher 's explanation rings true , you 've done you r job : made her aware of your concern . Bot if you feel even a slight prickle of discomfort , ask to meet . " I'here , repeat your child 's version of the story , using neutral phrases such as " Bobl ) by feels ... " " Ihen let her respond . If you truly believe the teacher has acted unfairly , ask : " Can we work something out so that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're asking for her input while still standing firmly behind your youngster . And do n't be shy about pointing out athome successes : " Mly experience with Jane tells me shouting does n't work . Having her write about what she 's done wrong is usually effective . I 'd appreciate it if you could try that if the need comes tip . " SITUiN ' ' : I think mv child needs more of a challenge SOLUTION : First , ask for a meeting And then avoid telling the teacher she 's not teaching enough . Instead , open with a broad question : " How do you think Arthur is enjoy=in his year ? " " ' I , Ilis lets the teacher think and talk generally about what 's happening In the classroom , and sheds light on your concern , " says George Burns , the middle-school head of New York City 's Bank Street School for Children If the teacher has n't yet picked up on your child 's boredom , introduce it diplomatically . " Arthir 's complaining of being bored . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is affirmative , ask what extra challenges the teacher can provide and what you can do at holie . TIn , recap the plan : " We 'll enroll Arthur in the clifdren 's museum science program . You 'll assign him independent science projeers . " Ask for a bimonthly progress report by phone or note . If your perspective and the teacher 's seem far apart after your conference , do n't feel obliged to automatically accept his ideas . Mary O'Donnell of Croton-on-Hudson , NY , realized her son Brendan , 7 , was reading more advanced books at home than he was at school-in fact , he 'd started holding his books upside down to give himself the challenge of deciphering the letters . O'Donnell suggested that the teacher move him to a more demanding reading group . But Brendan 's teacher felt he was inattentive and distracted-not lacking for challenge . Still , at O'Donnell 's request , the teacher agreed to try the more rigorous reading program . Within two months , Brendan was back on track , and O'Donnell credits parent-teacher tcamxvork . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally right , " she says . " But we both realized something was n't working for Brendan , and we talked abolit it and worked it through . " * Taking the Next Step When you ca n't reach an agreeable resolution with the teacher , experts suggest contacting a school counselor or the principal . Explain the situation and ask for the counselor 's help in resolving the problem . He or she often will be prepared to act as a mediator . If necessary , the counselor or principal will invite one teacher to help represent your side and another to act as an advocate for the teacher involved in the controversy . Go to the principal immediately in any abusive situation-or any time you feel you have no other option . -D . U. <p>
