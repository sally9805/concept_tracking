<p> BALLET , FOR MANY PEOPLE , IS STILL AN art of swans , peasants and supernatural creatures , neat lines of dancers who frame and complement the stars of the performance in perfect synchrony without a leg or arm or wisp of hair astray . Whether the " boys and girls " of the present or the " ladies and gentlemen of the ensemble " of earlier times , the corps de ballet has been the motor of 19th-century works like " Swan Lake " with its fluttering birds and " Giselle " with its vengeful Wilis , the ghostly spirits who , mesmerized and mesmerizing , invariably draw applause as they travel en masse across the stage . The corps has been there to magnify atmosphere , plot and the architecture and spectacle of the choreography . <p> But that has changed . No 19th-century choreographer would recognize the corps in modern ballets . Corps dancers are no longer ciphers in ordered rows of uniform bodies that move as one . Now they often perform the same steps as the stars and are recognizably individual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring season on Tuesday in the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center , is the prime example of this change . City Ballet is widely acclaimed for a corps that may not be the neatest but is certainly one of the most exciting anywhere . In its youthful ranks are to be found lead dancers of the future , and they are routinely plucked from the chorus to take on roles normally danced by the soloists . ( Because of the loss of 15 dancers in 1995 , nearly a third of the corps is new this year . ) <p> It is not surprising that the democratized ballet of today is embodied by City Ballet , because the transformation of the corps began with George Balanchine , co-founder of the company with Lincoln Kirstein , and " Serenade , " Balanchine 's first American work , created in 1934 . " Serenade " established one of Balanchine 's most important  --  and peculiar  --  credos . An ode , in effect , to the corps de ballet , " Serenade " celebrated what had historically been the lowliest dancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they spent more time on the stage than anyone else in a company . <p> There was a great power and a beauty to their ranks , Balanchine 's choreography suggested , and an extraordinary sensitivity to spatial relationships . Yet it was from those ranks that the ballet 's soloists darted . " We have no corps , " Balanchine explained years later , in a typically gnomic statement that was his way of saying that at City Ballet , a corps dancer was required to be as good as any soloist . <p> This season , in addition to 14 soloists and 21 principals , there are 47 members of thecorps at City Ballet . The median age in the corps is 22 , making it one of the youngest in memory . Many of the 47 are likely to advance to soloist within five years ; some will spend their careers in the corps , but almost all would be considered good material for soloists in any company . To some degree , that is because of what these dancers perform . <p> " Balanchine 's ballets will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way up , " said Peter Martins , who became City Ballet 's ballet master in chief after Balanchine died in 1983 . " I have ballet directors come in here saying they would like to have a Balanchine ballet because it 's the best way for their corps de ballet to learn to dance . " The Mission : ' Real Dancing ' <p> The idea of the corps as a kind of wallpaper in motion was not established until the Romantic era , nearly four centuries after the creation , in 1581 , of what is considered the first ballet . In the Romantic ballet , corps dancers were seen as a collective personality intended to communicate the poetry and atmosphere of a work . <p> Balanchine , though he trained in St. Petersburg , Russia , in the traditions of pure classicism and formal splendor epitomized by the ballets of Marius Petipa , came of artistic age in a time of experimentation . In Europe , touring troupes  --  more adaptable companies in which divisions were blurred and for which it was possible to create more complex choreography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines were erased . <p> Balanchine 's later ballets would often allude more directly to the classical traditions of his youth . But the corps would never function as mere decoration for Balanchine , Jerome Robbins or others who created dances for City Ballet , or for the ballet choreographers who have come into prominence elsewhere late in the 20th century . <p> " The choreography for our corps is real dancing , " said Sean Lavery , a leading principal dancer in City Ballet in the 1980 's , who is now Mr. Martins 's assistant . " Ours is more free , harder steps , more of a challenge . I love ' Giselle , ' but the corps really has to hold back . What makes it work is that they 're all in one line . " <p> It was not so many years after " Serenade " that Balanchine had virtuoso dancers to work with , many of them developed at the School of American Ballet , which he and Lincoln Kirstein founded in 1934 to provide dancers for a City Ballet predecessor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most City Ballet dancers today have passed from the school into the company as apprentice dancers and then corps members , thus insuring a uniformity of style . <p> " There are no auditions , " said Sean Savoye , who at 33 is a senior corps dancer at City Ballet , having been with the company for 10 years . The company takes very few dancers who have not come up through the ranks . " Basically , it 's a farm system , " Mr. Savoye said . <p> The students are often taught by members of the company , and Mr. Martins directs the school as well as City Ballet , keeping an eye on the young dancers . " We look for talent , quality , adaptability , " Mr. Martins said of the candidates for the corps . " They must learn a lot of ballets , learn them quickly , shift gears and be able to do it all : classical , neo-classical , modern . " <p> Because of the relatively large loss of dancers in 1995 , Mr. Martins has added 13 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the company from the school . Seven senior corps members were dismissed last year . ( Older dancers are less resilient and carry fatter salaries . The corps salary range is from $750 a week to $1,240 ; soloists receive $1,450 a week for performing . ) To Mr. Martins 's dismay , another eight were lost when they decided to move on to marriages , parenthood or other jobs . Even with the six apprentices , the corps is now one of the smallest since Mr. Savoye joined in 1983 , when it stood at 78 . ' Nutcracker ' to ' Tombeau ' <p> The corps dancer has generally first been an apprentice , restricted by union rules from performing in more than five ballets a season and from remaining an apprentice for more than two years . The first chance to be seen onstage usually comes in Balanchine 's " Nutcracker . " <p> " You put them in ' Flowers ' and ' Snow , ' and you learn a lot , " Mr. Martins said , referring to two large ensemble dances in that ballet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' which is the true test . It 's fierce , fast and furious . In many ways it is the toughest ballet to look good in . It shows what you truly are . It reveals you . You can not hide . " <p> Other apprentice repertory includes Balanchine 's " Chaconne " and the monster roles in the Balanchine-Robbins " Firebird . " <p> As the newest corps members learn " how to become a dancer , " as the soloist Michael Byars put it , they begin to work their way up to ballets like Mr. Martins 's " Ash " and Balanchine 's " Concerto Barocco , " " Stars and Stripes , " " Piano Concerto No. 2 " and " Theme and Variations . " " Serenade " and " Le Tombeau de Couperin , " created by Balanchine for the corps , are reserved for experienced dancers who are considered to have earned the honor . " ' Tombeau ' is a real gift , " Mr. Lavery said . <p> Eventually , the job of corps dancing becomes a routine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 ballets a season , a lot more than other companies , " Mr. Savoye said . " I must know 100 ballets . You 're responsible for 60 hours a week . Class is at 10 or 10:30 in the morning . The show 's out at 10:30 . Six days a week . " <p> Dancers begin to find a niche on the stage . " I dance with the same guys , the ' buffalos , ' who are taller , bigger corps men , " Mr. Savoye said . " They 're the backbone , not just because they look the best but because they 're reliable and experienced . " <p> What makes a good corps dancer at City Ballet ? It is a tricky job that requires dancers to be constantly alert and to subjugate their egos . The accomplished corps member knows how to coordinate with others almost intuitively , echoing body lines and maintaining the right distance without seeming to be aware of positions onstage . <p> Not everyone can pirouette with equal facility to the left and the right ; up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch up with the women in technique , it was possible to spot men turning the wrong way in the finales of some of Balanchine 's large ballets . Still , some dancers just ca n't seem to dance in the corps . <p> " They do n't know how to function in a group , " Mr. Savoye said . " In class , they teach you to be a virtuoso . A lot of what I do in class I wo n't have to do onstage , though this is changing . You develop a reserve of technical proficiency , as well as the wind to dance the puffy , or ' aerobically challenging , ' roles . " <p> Mr. Lavery was one who had problems adjusting to the corps . " I was terrible , " he said , laughing ruefully . " I could never stay in line . It was hard for me to dance with other people . " One of his worst memories is of a performance in which he forgot the direction he was supposed to move in the Diamonds section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the air like a big X and did n't commit myself until I saw the way the others were going , " he recalled . Fate , it seemed , had ordained that Mr. Lavery dance alone as at least a solo dancer . <p> There are dancers who enjoy the sense of community and safety that dancing in a group provides . " Some dancers are very uncomfortable being alone onstage with 3,000 people staring at them , " Mr. Lavery said . At City Ballet , though , the corps is primarily a proving ground , not a haven . <p> " Thinking back over my 19 years here , I remember a lot of people being thrown into things , " Mr. Lavery said . " Balanchine would try them out , often with no warning . It was hard because we were n't videotaping in those days , so you could n't just go in a room and stare at a video . " <p> " After the first or second year you are in every ballet in the repertory , " he continued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , but if you 're good you 're in ' Concerto Barocco . ' People develop at different speeds , but that 's the time when you see the progress , when you see who 's going to make it or not . Some kids you ca n't take your eyes off . They could be a monster , all covered up in ' The Firebird , ' but they 're the best monster . They 're really dancing . " Plucked From the Ranks <p> Will the dancer snatched out of the corps take command or crumble ? Maria Kowroski , a 19-year-old from Grand Rapids , Mich. , joined City Ballet as an apprentice in June 1994 , fresh from the School of American Ballet , and became a full member of the corps in January 1995 . In her first couple of weeks as an apprentice she was called to a rehearsal for Hippolyta , Queen of the Amazons , a challenging pyrotechnical lead role in Balanchine 's " Midsummer Night 's Dream . " She did n't get the part , but in her first full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more major roles . <p> Ms. Kowroski performed the Siren in Balanchine 's " Prodigal Son " exactly a year after dancing in the school 's workshop performances . " It was incredible , " she said . " I have probably never been so nervous in my life . I had never seen the ballet before . I watched a lot of tapes . I read about it . " <p> She received a greater shock later in the season . Mr. Lavery had told her to start working on her fouettes , a kind of virtuoso whipping pirouette , in preparation for dancing the demanding fourth movement of Balanchine 's " Western Symphony . " Soon after , she heard her name announced for a rehearsal of " Swan Lake , " which meant she was dancing Odette , queen of the swans . <p> " It ca n't be , " she told her friends . " They said it had to be . I went to rehearsal , and it was . Then Sean said to start looking at the second movement in ' Symphony in C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another new thing . But it was exciting . " <p> It was also an overwhelming experience , she said . Ms. Kowroski danced Odette at the end of the winter season this year . The corps had been further depleted by injuries , so she was asked to perform in the corps the night before her big debut . " I blanked out a couple of times because I was thinking about Odette , " she said . " Then I went back into the corps afterward . It 's tough at the end of a season , when so many people are injured . <p> " I was in different positions in the corps before and after , because I was replacing different people , " she explained . " That was the thing I had to focus on . But that is also what I have to do . " Making Art and a Living <p> That sense of responsibility is typical of most City Ballet corps dancers . It is a notion that recurs frequently in Mr. Savoye 's talk of his life in the company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me was an unbelievably defined sense of direction at an incredibly young age , " he said , looking back on a career that started at 12 , when he played the little prince in " The Nutcracker . " <p> He took two years off in 1990 after he married and " felt the pressure of my future breathing down my neck . " He returned with a new love for ballet but is beginning to prepare for the time when he must stop . <p> " I do n't think anyone enters the corps thinking they 're going to stay there , " Mr. Savoye said . " The process of coming to terms with that is an individual one . For me , it 's the fish-and-pond analogy and I consider us the biggest pond . For me , it 's the best job . I 'm a corps dancer , a team player . <p> " It 's never been work . Sure , I 've paid my dues . I 've had three knee operations , and we 'll see how I walk when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living . I dance . Not many people can do it . Which is why bitterness in the corps always amazes me . " <p> There are boring times , certainly . " Four weeks of ' Nutcracker ' can be excruciating , because it 's four weeks straight , " he said . " We do two of ' Sleeping Beauty ' and one of ' Midsummer Night 's Dream . ' But otherwise we do n't do the same ballet more than four to six times a season . Can you imagine doing ' Cats ' for 15 years ? " <p> In the City Ballet corps , a dancer dances . A revealing description of that pleasure came from Tracy Bennett , a corps dancer of the 1970 's , in an interview in 1975 , referring specifically to the Balanchine repertory . <p> " No matter where you are and what you 're doing , you feel like everyone is the star , " said Mr. Bennett , who died in 1991 . " Everyone is so important , and plays such an important role in pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so incredibly excited about everyone doing the same thing , and with that rhythm , that cosmic rhythm , and that motion , you get carried away . It 's like the Negro spirituals. "
