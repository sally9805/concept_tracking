WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WITH MY FIRST CHILD , thirty-one women in Oxford , including my stepdaughter , Tippy , were due to give birth within three months of each other . Theories abounded as to the cause of this phenomenon-a record-breaking cold winter , some new farm chemical in the drinking water-but nobody knew for sure . We were written up in newspapers all over the country : " Fertile Indiana County to Produce Bumper Crop of Babies , " etcetera . When I first found out I was expecting I imagined my large self strolling the streets of Oxford and people stopping to inquire how the baby was doing , remarking on my healthy glow , but by the time I began to show , pregnant women were so common nobody gave us a second look . I did n't even get special attention from my husband , because his darling daughter Tippy , who lived with us , was having twins . <p> One day in late June , when I was eight months along , I got an invitation in the mail from People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the other pregnant women , a photo to be taken in a cornfield on the edge of town . " Not me , " I said to my husband that evening . " They only want to make us look like a bunch of hicks . " I was sitting at the kitchen table watching him chop vegetables from his garden . I 'd stopped cooking because it hurt my back to stand for more than a minute . <p> " We are hicks , hon , " he said . He could talk that way because he 'd grown up in Indianapolis . When he first saw Oxford he was like an explorer who 'd stumbled upon a lost paradise . He 'd spent most of his life in apartment complexes and condos , so he 'd embraced my life-me and my parents and brothers and the entire town of Oxford , which he called Leave It to Beaverville-with a giddy devotion . At first I 'd found his attitude flattering , but we 'd been married for three years and reality had yet to sink in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him . <p> The woman who manages the cafe " accidentally " poisoned her invalid mother . My brothers used to make me go door to door collecting money for the Mentally Retarded Foundation . " Those things give a small town charm , " he said . We lived in a converted chicken hatchery because he thought it was quaint . It was brick , had high ceilings , lots of windows , and wall-to-wall carpet , but we could never get rid of the mice or the smell . I was beginning to suspect I 'd married a happy fool . <p> He stopped dicing carrots and held up the knife . " What about us fathers ? " he said . " Why not take a picture of us in front of the hardware store , displaying our tools ? " He wore nothing but a pair of plaid shorts that showed off his flat stomach . He was thirty-eight , twelve years older than me , but his graying hair looked like a disguise on a much younger man . <p> " Hey there , mother-to-be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though she was only five months pregnant , her stomach was bigger than mine . <p> I waggled my fat fingers at her . <p> " Greetings , Egg , " she said . When they moved to Oxford , Tippy gave her father the nickname Egg because right away he joined the Lions Club and Friends of the Library and got elected to the town council . A good egg . <p> Egg tossed Tippy a tomato . " Hi , kiddo , " he said . " Got Rudy and Loretta 's medicine chest stocked today , " Tippy said . " Everything but a thermometer . " She 'd known for weeks she was having a girl and a boy , and she 'd been calling them by name for just as long . She took a big bite out of the tomato and licked the seeds from her lips . " You got yours done , Katie ? " <p> " Have n't had time , " I said . " I do n't get to hang around the house all day . " Egg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government research study . Egg once said he really admired me for doing it , but he was n't interested in unpleasant details , and neither was Tippy , because she did n't want anyone else getting any attention for anything , even for drinking themselves to death . <p> Egg tossed a rotten broccoli stump into the sink , then cheered like he 'd scored a three-pointer . " Beaverville 's gon na be a great place for Rudy and Loretta to grow up . " He winked at his daughter . Then he smiled politely at me . " And baby X , too , " he said . <p> Egg and I still had n't settled on a name , because , though we 'd been thrilled at first , now we hardly ever talked about our child . Tippy and her babies had overshadowed us and ours . I knew I should initiate a discussion of baby names , or help with the salad , or wipe the coffee splatter off the wall , or fix up the baby 's room , which was still a storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room . Tippy dropped her tomato pulp in the trash and followed me , plopping down in my new rocking chair . <p> I sat cross-legged on the carpet , which smelled like chicken poop , and tried to do yoga , a position I 'd seen in one of the books . " Think I 'll call People magazine and offer to pose nude , " Tippy announced . She was always saying and doing things to make her seem more interesting than she really was . One time she and her high-school friends got caught walking around Oxford at midnight dressed only in their underwear , wearing dog bowls on their heads . Egg treated Tippy like she was Anne of Green Gables , though all evidence pointed to the contrary . She 'd been living with us the entire time we 'd been married , and I 'd tried to be tolerant , counting the days till she finished high school and moved out . But on the night of her graduation , driving home from the ceremony , Tippy calmly announced her pregnancy . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was , and when I asked , he shot me a reproachful look . " I ca n't tell you , " Tippy said , " it would n't be right " - as though the father were the President of the United States instead of one of the shifty-eyed grease monkeys from the high school . She also said she 'd decided to keep living with us while she went to Purdue , so we could help each other with childcare . There was no question of her living with her mother , who traveled around the U.S. doing healingtouch therapy . When we got home that night I locked myself in the bathroom and cried in the shower till the water ran cold . <p> Tippy was rocking vigorously in my chair . She 'd done up her hair in stubby little pigtails , and she wore one of her creations-the bottom half of a pair of overalls sewn onto some hacked-up workshirts . She made spending money by sewing old flannel shirts together to make dresses and selling them to rich idiots in West Lafayette . Any day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of her sense of style , her good looks , and her singing/acting talent . Oblivious , just like her father . <p> " Your hair looks dumb , " I said . <p> " Good , " she said . " That 's the effect I wanted . " She flipped her braids around like propellers . <p> In the kitchen , Egg dropped silverware on the table . " Hey , guys , I wo n't be able to go out Friday night , " he called . " Board meeting . You two can celebrate without me . " <p> Friday was Tippy 's nineteenth birthday . She leaned toward me and said in a low voice , " Let 's skip dinner and go to the Stabilizer . It 's dollar pitcher night . " Tippy always told me about the drinking and pot-smoking and screwing around she did , thinking , I guess , that she was making me jealous . Or maybe she was trying to be pals . Either way , it was annoying , because I was attempting to be a grownup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , " I said , but even as I said it , I thought it did n't sound half bad . Tippy was more fun when she had a buzz on . " Never drink alcohol when you 're pregnant , " the books instructed , so I 'd just drink Coke and watch Tippy pickle the twins . Egg would disapprove , and that thought pleased me . Served him right for sticking me with Tippy . <p> The following morning I left my office in the Purdue psych department and drove out to Whispering Winds Treatment Center to interview a new research subject . Whispering Winds was housed in a former country club , tucked back on a gravel road and surrounded by oak trees and meadows , but the beauty of the setting could not penetrate the building . I waddled through the first set of doors , checked in with the guard-a precaution against court-ordered patients bolting-stepped up to the desk , where a young black woman wearing a spiffy gold blazer sat doodling , and asked for Dub . The light inside was murky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Where 's Dub ? " she shouted at a patient shuffling by in his bathrobe . <p> " Ai n't seen him . Whoa , " he said , taking note of my pregnant state . I stepped out of his way . Though I tried not to let on , the patients spooked me-looking as if they 'd just risen up from hell and would slide back down first chance they got . Most probands , as we called them , had been in treatment at least ten times . At first I was mesmerized by their tragic stories about car accidents , vicious mothers , club-wielding boyfriends , wrist-slittings , lost jobs and lost houses and lost children and on and on , until at last they began to sound like one big collective wail of self-pity and despair . I 'd majored in psychology because I thought it would expose me to fascinating pathologies while at the same time reassuring me I was normal , sort of like an inoculation , and I also had the vague hope that my normalcy might somehow rub off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred . I kept at it because it was my first real job and I did n't know what else I wanted to do . My fellow interviewers performed their jobs like efficient machines , but the misery emitted by our clients seemed to soak into my pores , weighing me down , and pregnancy only made it worse . <p> Dub sat waiting for me in a group-therapy room . His hair , on the crown of his head , stuck up like a mitten . He was missing his left arm below the elbow , and a dirty shirt sleeve flapped over the stump . Except for the stump , he looked like most of the people I interviewed . " I 'm Katie , " I said . <p> " And I 'm a sorry son of a bitch . " He thrust out his hand for me to shake . His grip was firm and confident , which took me by surprise . I sat down across from him , set up my tape recorder , and explained the confidentiality bit , his payment of fifty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about drinking but also about other things related to drinking , and , finally , that we might want a sample of his blood . He nodded when a response was called for , a half-smile never leaving his face . I had a hard time not smiling too . <p> I quickly discovered that Dub was n't a typical proband at all . He had a master 's degree in philosophy from Berkeley . " Ethics , " he said . " Can you believe it ? I 'm a sorry son of a bitch . " <p> " No , you 're not , " I heard myself say , and then , red-faced , I went on to the next question , reminding myself to erase that part of the tape . I 'd once gotten in trouble because my boss , Dr. Schmidt , listened to a tape of an interview I 'd done . When the subject said he 'd never smoked pot , I said , " Wow , really ? " <p> It took Dub forever to answer the questions , which would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let alone someone who 'd lived for years in an alcoholic fog-questions like " Have you ever drunk more than you intended ? How many times ? " Subjects usually caught on in a hurry that they were supposed to guess , but not Dub . " Do n't think too much , " I told him cheerfully . But still he sat there , twisting up his face , trying to come up with the correct response as if for my sake . I found myself staring at the posters on the walls , posters made by patients for therapeutic reasons-cut-out pictures and letters from magazines that said ambiguous things like , " Love is a fourletter word . " I kept expecting Dub to tell me how he 'd lost his arm , but he never mentioned it . <p> Finally , halfway through the manic-depressive section , after four bathroom trips for me and four cigarette breaks for him , Dub 's diligence got to me . Though I knew Dr. Schmidt would not be pleased , I reached over and punched off my tape recorder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , gathering my materials officiously . I told myself that even someone holding a gun to my head could not make me ask Dub another question . As if relieved by this decision , my baby began to roll , and I stifled an impulse to watch . <p> Dub pointed at my belly and said , " That 's one lucky kid . " Tears welled in my eyes , and I did n't know if they were tears of frustration or gratitude . " You 'll get your check next week , " I said , blinking , telling myself it was probably just my hormones . <p> On Friday night , Tippy and I drove fifteen miles into West Lafayette to go to the Stabilizer . I 'd hung out there in college , and Tippy 'd been sneaking in on a fake ID since she was sixteen . The place was nearly empty-only a few booths were occupied by morose students , and the long trestle tables in the middle were empty . The bartender , leaning on the bar , looked half-asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pitcher of beer and a clean glass in front of him . I 'd never run into one of my research subjects in public before , let alone in a bar . I knew I should n't speak to him , but I could n't help it . I walked over and stuck my bulk in his line of vision . " Off the wagon already ? " I asked . <p> " I 'm a sorry son of a bitch , " he said again , but it did n't sound the same . He wore an Oxford-cloth shirt pinned neatly over what was left of his arm . He tossed his shiny blond mane back from his forehead . " Two pregnant women come into a bar , " he said . " Must be the dt 's . " When I did n't laugh , he said , " Do n't worry , I wo n't drink more than I intend to . " <p> " It 's not like I care , " I said . " I just collect data . " He turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is that ? A bunch of shirts sewn together ? " He bit his lower lip boyishly . <p> Before I could stop her , Tippy slid in beside him . I hulked over them disapprovingly for a minute , then squeezed into the opposite side of the booth , watching them drink , listening to him impress Tippy by describing his travels around the world and the various philosophies he 'd held . It was hard not to fall under Dub 's spell . Nobody from Oxford ever went anywhere or changed philosophies . I lived on campus while going to Purdue , but though I constantly complained about Oxford , I never considered not moving back . Countless times I 'd drunk myself stupid in the Stabilizer , flirting desperately with frat boys , sometimes hooking one for a month or two . After graduation , though , the frat boys went off to Chicago or Minneapolis , and I met Egg in the library parking lot when he volunteered to jump-start my car . He did n't mention Tippy until our fourth date , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and felt so guilty about the divorce and her lack of a mother that he could never deny her anything or discipline her at all . And now look at the result , I thought , watching Tippy lean against Dub , pat his shoulder , giggle at his jokes . I 'm her stepmother , I thought . I should drag her away by the hair . <p> " I used to hang out in an ashram in Santa Clara , " Dub was saying . " I was super religious , had my own temple . Ever heard of Leufredus ? " Tippy said , " Who ? " <p> " A French monk . Eighth century . Patron saint invoked against flies . The flies were bothering old Leufredus one day while he was praying , and ZAPI They never darkened his door again . " Dub shook his head as if he felt sorry for the flies . " A woman called him bald , and he caused all her hair to fall out . A thief slandered him , and he and his family lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I muttered . <p> " Hey , " Tippy said , scolding me . " Saints do n't have to be nice , just intense . " <p> " Anyway , " Dub went on , " when I was living in California , I read up on saints , and I decided why not be one . It was a lucrative deal . Never had to work a day . I called myself Leufredus , sat on some pillows in my log cabin , and people came to see me and give me money . I 'd promise to get rid of something bothersome in their lives , like houseflies . " <p> " Or teeth , " I said , trying to be funny , but they both just looked at me as if they 'd forgotten I was there . <p> " Dub 's a bad hat , " I told Tippy on the way home . We were driving down a two-lane road , the windows open , and the air smelled like rotten bananas-fumes from the Eli Lilly plant . I was about to break every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing more about Dub than Tippy did . " He 's taken every drug known to man , " I said . " Could n't even count his sexual partners . " <p> Tippy , spread-legged beside me in the front seat , just snickered . " I 'm meeting him tomorrow night . Pregnant women turn him on . " <p> " But he 's a one-armed al-co-hol-ic , " I said loudly . I 'd had a couple of beers myself . " Besides , " I said , " he 's my alcoholic . I found him first . " <p> She shrugged . " I guess he likes me better . " " What would Egg think ? " I said , but she knew I 'd never tell him , because I could n't bear to see his innocence destroyed . And it was useless to appeal to Tippy 's sense of right and wrong . She played Joni Mitchell songs on her guitar and told her friends she 'd written them , figuring the ' 60s were too long ago for anyone to remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He 's so boring . " She was drunker than I was . " God bless Egg . " She burst into tears . She was acting like Vera in Auntie Mame , the role she 'd had in her senior musical . Nobody had the heart to tell Tippy she had a mediocre voice , not even the director . The audience clapped wildly after she did a number , impressed by her sheer gall . For my high-school musical I 'd played cello in the pit orchestra . <p> A great horned owl swooped out of a cornfield , glared at us through the windshield , then disappeared into another dark cornfield across the road . " If you sleep with Dub , " I said , stepping on the gas again , " do n't tell me a thing about it . " <p> A week later , when Egg was out at a Methodist Men 's Group meeting , Tippy and I sat across from each other at the kitchen table , hunched over our own games of solitaire . I had three aces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked smug , the way she 'd been looking since she met Dub . I finally blurted out , " So what was it like ? " My skin was stretched so tightly over my stomach that it prickled . Egg and I had stopped having sex when it became like gymnastics and we laughed ourselves out of the mood , but lately I found myself wanting to do it more than ever . The books never mentioned this . <p> " The things he can do with that stump , " Tippy said , pushing my aces aside to make room for one of hers . " I 'd give anything to wake up next to him every morning . " <p> I studied my cards again , looking for a play , though I knew there was n't one . I 'd never had to ask for details before . " What exactly did he do with the stump ? " <p> " All kinds of things . " She fingered the cards in her hand , pulled out a two of diamonds , and slapped it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Let 's just say I 'd love to wrap myself around that stump again . " She glanced up at me . " You 're pouting , Ma . " " I 'm fine . " <p> " I 've got a plan , " Tippy said , snapping down cards on her aces with a flourish . " Dub and the babies and I will go down south . We 'll live on a plantation and wrap our heads in rags . " <p> " The rag part sounds feasible . " I scooped up my cards , tapped them into a pack , and began shuffling again . " I 'm going out to Whispering Winds tomorrow , " I said . " Maybe I 'll find you a new boyfriend . " " Tell Dub to call me , " she said . " If he 's there . " <p> " Really ? " <p> She studied her stomach , her face thoughtful . " I feel like Rudy and Loretta are part Dub 's now , " she said . " They could both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his stump . " She glanced back up at me . " What are you wearing to the People magazine picture ? " <p> " A sheet . If I go . " <p> " I ordered a new dress from Mamadear , " she said . " Black satin . Maybe I 'll get some commercials out of it . " My last proband at Whispering Winds was a crack addict with a long greasy ponytail who could n't sit still . He paced around the room , spitting out answers to my questions . " How many times have you smoked marijuana ? " <p> " Two hundred three , " he said , not even pretending to think about it . He kept going off on tangents about how he was a trained sous-chef and how his son , now in prison for a drive-by , had raped his daughter , and he kept tearing strips of tape off a dispenser , rolling them into balls , and flicking them across the room like boogers . We completed what was usually a four-hour interview in six hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brick wall by a fire hose . <p> On my way out to the car I saw Dub sitting in the courtyard , wearing a white T-shirt and khaki shorts , sunning himself and smoking a cigarette . The fact that he was missing part of one arm seemed like an optical illusion . He looked so good I wondered if he was back in treatment again or just visiting . I walked over and stood beside him . " Dub , " I said , and it came out sounding like " duh . " <p> " Oh , hi , doll . " He squinted up at me . " How 's your stepdaughter ? Great girl . Too good for me . But who is n't ? " He smiled ruefully at his cigarette . " At least they let me sit out here . I go along with the program , even though it never takes . Have a seat . " <p> I sank into a webbed lawn chair in the shade of an oak tree . A breeze cooled my forehead . I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . <p> " Beautiful day , huh ? " Dub said . He pointed to a meadow that used to be the golf course . " Saw thirteen ostriches out there last night , " he said . " It was mystical . " <p> " There 's an ostrich farm next door , " I said , hating the sound of my practical voice . <p> Dub just smiled . A cardinal sang from the oak . There were wildflowers in the meadow-blue chicory and pink asters . It was mystical . I did n't want to go back to the office . I tried to gaze out at the meadow , but found myself watching Dub instead . <p> " Would you like to know , " he said , " how I lost my arm ? " " I guess so . " It was strange to be talking to Dub like a person instead of a research subject . It felt natural and wrong at the same time , <p> Dub took a drag of his cigarette . " Back when I was living in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like now . Only I convinced myself I had a higher calling . Every once in a while I 'd get really stoned and drunk and tell my friends to hold me down and chop an inch off my arm . " <p> I looked down at my own arm , pale but substantial . " Why ? " " To prove I was holy , " Dub said . " That 's how I convinced people I was a saint . It worked so well I did n't mind the pain . " He stroked his stump with his hand . " But one morning I sort of saw the light . After a six-day binge . " <p> " That 's crazy , " I said . " It is on the sick side , " Dub agreed . I wondered why I was n't more repulsed by his story . For some reason it only added to his appeal . <p> Dub must 've read my expression . " You look sweet . " He bit his lower lip . " Hope you do n't mind my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembering what Tippy 'd said about pregnant women turning him on . I wished I 'd worn my blue gauze maternity dress instead of the denim jumper . Wishing this made me nervous . " So have you seen Tippy lately ? " I asked . " Not since that one night , " he said . <p> I kicked my briefcase over in front of my chair and propped my swollen , sandaled feet on it . Dub looked at my briefcase and must 've remembered that I was there on business . " What can I do you for ? Should I chop off my other arm for the U.S. government ? " " Just wanted to say hi . " I swung my feet back onto the ground . " Wait . " Dub pulled my chair closer to his and placed his bare stump on my stomach . The stump was pure white . Both baby and I held still . <p> " It 's a boy , " Dub whispered . " Sleeping peacefully . " " Good , " I said . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid or hurt for even a second . Suppose my baby turned out to be a proband ? " Future Probands of America , " my coworkers and I called the children we interviewed . " What about after he 's born ? " I said . " Will he still be happy ? " <p> " Sometimes , " Dub said , nodding . " He 'll love canoeing , I can promise you that . " He drew his stump back . His eyes were the color of chestnuts . " I have to tell you , " he said . " I 'm very attracted to you . I felt it right away , the day you first interviewed me , when I first saw you fiddling with your little tape recorder , when you first started in with your spiel about locked cabinets and limited access . " <p> I knew he was lying , but my face flushed , and then the rest of me . " I think Tippy 's in love with you , " I said . <p> Dub leaned forward , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even his sweat smelled good . " Now what 's this ? " he said , and he looked so much like a regular person , a person who could live a good life , that I wanted to hug him . <p> " Promise you 'll stop drinking forever , " I said , knowing it was the absolute wrong thing to say . <p> He reached for my hand , like for some reason he had to console me , but I pulled it away . I did n't want comfort from Dub . I did n't know what I wanted . " Tippy told me she wants to wake up with you every morning , " I said . " She thinks of the babies as part yours . " <p> " Really ? " He did n't look surprised so much as happy . He sat for a while , grinning into space , and then slapped his thigh . " This is just what I need to straighten my ass out . " He jumped out of his chair , bent over and kissed me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bless you . " I said , " Thank you , Leufredus . " <p> " I 'll be right back . " He handed me his burning cigarette , turned , and ran into the treatment center . The screen door slapped closed behind him . " I 'm going to be a daddy ! " I heard him yell . " It 's twinsl " Sunlight was eating up my shade , but still I sat there . All the books claimed that pregnancy was a serene , introspective time , so why was I feeling the need to consort with an alcoholic ? I might not be an alcoholic , I thought , but there is definitely something wrong with me . Get up and go , I told myself , but I sat there , flicking ashes off Dub 's cigarette , sniffing secondhand smoke , waiting for him to return . <p> When he did , the cigarette had burned out and he had a strangely earnest look on his face . " I 've got to go see Tippy , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Call her up . " I was sitting in full sun , sweating . I was n't sure what I 'd set in motion , but there did n't seem to be a way to stop it . He sat down beside me , radiating energy . " I already called her , " he said . " Now I 've got to see her . " He lowered his voice . " I 'm court-ordered this time . Thirty days . I 've only done five . " <p> His insistence seemed all out of whack . " Ca n't she come see you ? " I said . <p> He shook his head . " Not in here . Not like this . " I reached over and touched his stump , thrilled by my audacity . The skin was soft and thin , but underneath it his arm was muscular and pulsing . I could n't see any veins , but they had to be there , somewhere . " Tell them I 'm taking you to the lab for a blood draw , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I wo n't come back , " he said . " I do n't need this idiot box . " " That 's true , " I said . " It does n't seem to be helping . " Dub said , " If you spring me , you 'll be cooking your goose . They 'll never let you in here again . " <p> " Would n't that be a shame , " I said . I felt like I 'd taken some sort of drug , a drug Dub and his kind were most likely very familiar with , a drug that convinced me I could , and should , do whatever I wanted . " Let 's go , " I told him . <p> Dub asked me to take him straight to his apartment . He stared out the window of my university car , cradling his stump and bumping his knees together , and only spoke to give me directions . By then I felt like I was tripping . As I turned onto the bypass the Escort felt as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything was hyper-real-Dub 's hairy knee , a child tossing a blue ball in a parking lot . The movie theater looked like a garish Oriental temple . When I pulled up in front of Valle view Villas , Dub unfolded himself from the car , said , " Bye now , " like I was nothing more than a taxi driver , and disappeared between two brick buildings . I sat there for a moment , wondering for the first time if his sudden interest in Tippy was nothing more than the desire for a drink . Either way , I had to admit that I 'd enjoyed our ruse more than I 'd enjoyed anything in a long time . Did that make me as mentally ill as he was ? I drove away , slowly coming down from the Dub drug . It was no fun being bad alone . <p> By the time I got home the scenery had flattened out to normal , and I was left with a queasy aftertaste of guilt . I knocked on the door of Tippy 's room . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was racing a sports car . A little girl 's dress with a plaid skirt was under the needle . Tippy wore a sundress of different plaids . Her hair was up in hot rollers . <p> " Going out ? " I asked over the roar of the machine . I sat down on the trunk at the foot of her bed . I did n't want to get comfortable . I had my speech all prepared . I 'd only told Dub what she 'd told me . Even though I knew she had n't meant him to hear a word of it . She would n't look at me . " Dub 's coming by . We 're heading out to the East Coast . Vermont , maybe . " <p> She did n't sound very happy about it . I felt a stab of jealousy , which I covered over with a stern voice . " You wo n't have much of a future , " I told her , " if you start out like this . " My finger traced the decoupage Smokey Bear on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Better than staying in Oxford . " Tippy flipped up the needle and whisked the dress out of the machine . " The thing is , " she began , and turned toward me . Her eyes were puffy . " Dub was n't really good in bed-he passed out on me . I just said all that to get your goat . But now I 'm stuck . He 's so excited about being a father . " <p> " That does n't make any sense , " I said ; but somehow , in our little world , it did . I shifted uncomfortably on the edge of the trunk , feeling like the weight of my belly was going to pull me onto the floor . I tried for a mature response . " You can make it on your own . You do n't need Dub . " <p> " You do . And you ca n't have him . " <p> I took a deep breath , but it did n't help . " Dub did n't even remember your name , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had n't remembered my name either , but I did n't mention that . There was a horrible silence . No one talked to the great Tippy like this . The words kept coming . " He touched me with his stump , " I said . " He predicted that my baby will lead a happy life . " <p> Tippy shook her finger at me , her face crumpled with disgust . " You look like Patty Duke , going around in those ugly clothes . Why do n't you live your own life for once ? " I could tell she 'd been wanting to say that to me for a long time . Then she sighed , as if she could n't be bothered with me anymore . She held out the plaid dress . " Here 's a going-away present for your baby , " she said . " I 've been working on it all day . It has a matching hat . " <p> The dress had a blue-and-green plaid skirt sewn onto a little white onesie with blue satin trim . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my cheek . I knew she had n't been planning to give the dress to me , and I knew my baby was a boy , but for some reason that made me treasure it even more . I 'd wanted to apologize to Tippy , but it seemed she was the one apologizing to me , not just for going off with Dub , but for leaving me here with Egg . <p> When Egg came home from playing basketball , I was propped up in my rocking chair with a box of chocolates . He collapsed on the futon couch , working his sneakers off without untying them . He was all wound up about a Chicago Tribune reporter lurking around Main Street . " He interviewed me , " Egg said . " It was fun . " <p> " Why you ? " I popped another chocolate into my mouth . " Limit your intake of caffeine , " all the books insisted . " They 're thinking maybe something 's buried under our house , " Egg said . " From when it used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaking into the soil . " <p> " She 's gone , " I said . " Who ? " <p> " Your daughter , " I said . " She ran off with a proband . " I expected Egg to spring up and do something , and when he did n't , I kept talking . " I helped him escape from the treatment center today . A hard-core alcoholic , but a nice guy . Somebody I sort of had a crush on . " I popped another chocolate . " Anyway , I 'd introduced him to Tippy a while back and they fell madly in love and now they 've run off to Vermont , and it 's my fault . " I had no idea what Egg 's reaction would be , because I 'd never been so honest with him before . <p> He lay there , staring at the ceiling , his profile lit by the floor lamp , until I wondered if he 'd heard me . Finally he sat up and rubbed his head till his hair stood on end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time since I 'd known him . he looked his age . And he looked desperate . " Where in Vermont ? " he said . <p> " You have another chance , with our baby , " I said . " A fresh start . " I handed him my box of chocolates , but he pushed them aside . " I 've got to go find her . " <p> " She did n't know for sure where they were going . " The hair of my arms bristled , though the room was warm . " She 's an adult , " I said . " Leave her be . " <p> " This is exactly what you wanted to happen . " His eyes hardened . He saw this as a contest between me and Tippy , and in any kind of contest , for him , Tippy would always win , even if her prize was dubious . <p> " It 's not exactly what I wanted , " I said , wondering what that would have been . <p> But Egg was already in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the People magazine picture , I got dressed up in my new Laura Ashley dress , made for very large nonpregnant women , and walked to the cornfield . The humidity was so high I felt slick all over . I passed the farm supply store , and the old guys who were always sitting at the counter gave me a wave . Egg had been gone over a week . He 'd called twice and sent postcards from all over Vermont , promising to come back for the baby 's birth , but I was n't holding my breath . <p> " I quit my job , " I told him one night when he called . " I told Dr. Schmidt that Dub jumped out of my car at a stoplight , so he did n't fire me , like I hoped he would . " <p> " What are you going to do ? " Egg said . " Be a checker at the Jack and Jill ? " <p> " I 'm going to be a mother . " <p> From all over Oxford , by foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cornfield . There was the new woman in town whose husband was in management at Purina Chow , the sixteenyear-old girl with terrible blue eyes , the Japanese woman , two teachers from the high school , and , of course , Marcia Tolliver in her army uniform . People magazine people were rushing here and there , waving clipboards . The photographer , a tall , thin woman who smoked cigarillos and wore little red sunglasses , ordered all of us to stand in a line between two rows of corn , up on a rise , turned sideways to expose our bellies . I looked out at the cornfields unfurling all the way to the horizon , at the wispy clouds hanging in the pale sky like afterthoughts . Even with my bulk I felt weightless , like I could drift off at any second and disappear . It was a pleasant sensation , and I could experience it anytime , I realized , if I 'd only come up and stand on this hill . I knew I should be unhappy , having no gainful employment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> My baby pushed up against my ribs , and I massaged him through my skin , kneading his tiny limbs with my fingertips , and for some reason I thought about Dub , cutting off his own arm , inch by inch . " I know why all these women got pregnant , " I told Marcia Tolliver , who was standing next to me . " We all decided we 're going to add on to ourselves , by having a baby , and make ourselves holy that way . " <p> " I did n't decide any such thing , " Marcia said , stepping back . " Anyway , that does n't explain why we all got knocked up at once . " " Maybe it 's a miracle , " I said . " I 'm going to name my baby Leufredus . " <p> " That 's nice , " she said , and turned her back on me . I never thought I 'd miss Tippy , but right then I did . I could just hear her saying , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many times do I have to tell you not to play with that hacksaw ? " <p> The photographer snapped pictures from down below , looking up at us . " Say whiskey , mommies , " she urged , but I was already smiling . <p>
