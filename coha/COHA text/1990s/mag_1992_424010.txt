Section : Global Warming Watch <p> One of the best-kept secrets in the global warming debate is that the plant life of Planet Earth would benefit greatly from a higher level of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in the atmosphere . <p> You read that correctly . Flowers , trees , and food crops love carbon dioxide , and the more they get of it , the more they love it . Carbon dioxide is the basic raw material that plants use in photo-synthesis to convert solar energy into food , fiber , and other forms of biomass . Voluminous scientific evidence shows that if C02 were to rise above its current ambient level of 360 parts per million , most plants would grow faster and larger because of more efficient photosynthesis and a reduction in water loss . There would also be other benefits for plants , among them greater resistance to temperature extremes and other forms of stress , better growth at low-light intensities , improved root/top ratios , less injury from air pollutants , and more nutrients in the soil as a result of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurserymen have been adding carbon dioxide to their greenhouses to raise the yields of vegetables , flowers , and ornamental plants . And for decades , it has been well known among botanists , biochemists , agriculturalists , and foresters that a shortage of carbon dioxide is the most common limiting factor preventing photosynthesis from proceeding more efficiently . <p> There is no question that the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere has been rising , and that this rise is due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels and to deforestation . Measured in terms of volume , there were about 280 parts of C02 in every million parts of air at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution , and there are 360 parts per million ( ppm ) today-a 30% rise . The annual increase is 2 ppm , and rising . If present trends continue , the concentration of C02 in the atmosphere will about double to about 700 ppm in the latter half of the 21st century . This increase would not be a direct threat to human life ; the threshold in mine-safety regulations is 5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this magnitude in the atmosphere requires careful efforts to understand its consequences . <p> While scientists disagree about the likely effects of additional carbon dioxide on global temperature , they generally agree on another important effect of a rise in the C02 level . A doubling of the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere , as is projected , would increase plant productivity by almost one-third . Most plants would grow faster and bigger , with increases in leaf size and thickness , stem height , branching , and seed production . The number and size of fruits and flowers would also rise . Root/top ratios would increase , giving many plants better root systems for access to water and nutrients . <p> More Efficient Photosynthesis <p> There are two important reasons for this productivity boost at higher C02 levels . One is superior efficiency of photosynthesis . The other is a sharp reduction in water loss per unit of leaf area . <p> Photosynthesis converts the renewable energy of sunlight into energy that living creatures can use . In the presence of chlorophyll , plants use sunlight to convert carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supply almost all animal and human needs for food ; oxygen and some water are released as by-products of this process . The principal factors affecting the rate of photosynthesis are a favorable temperature , the level of light intensity , and the availability of carbon dioxide . Most green plants respond quite favorably to concentrations of C02 well above current atmospheric levels . <p> A related benefit comes from the partial closing of pores in leaves that is associated with higher C02 levels . These pores , known as stomata , admit air into the leaf for photosynthesis , but they are also a major source of transpiration or moisture loss . By partially closing these pores , higher C02 levels greatly reduce the plants ' water loss-a significant benefit in arid climates . <p> Thousands of Experiments <p> Thousands of scientific experiments have been conducted to measure the effects of carbon dioxide enrichment on specific plants . In most green plants , productivity continues to rise up to C02 concentrations of 1,000 ppm and above . For rice , the optimal C02 level is between 1,500 and 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 to 50,000 ppm . <p> Bruce Kimball , a research leader of the Water Conservation Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Phoenix , has pulled together nearly 800 scientific observations from around the world measuring the response of food and flower crops to elevated C02 concentrations . The mean ( average ) response to a doubling of the C02 concentration from its current level of 360 ppm is a 32% improvement in plant productivity , with varied manifestations in different species . <p> Greenhouse-grown vegetables , including tomatoes , cucumbers , and lettuce , show earlier maturity , larger fruit size , greater number of fruit , a reduction in cropping time , and yield increases ranging from 10% to 70% , averaging 20% to 50% . <p> Greenhouse-grown flower crops , including roses , carnations , and chrysanthemums , grow to earlier maturity ; have longer stems ; and larger , longer-lived , more colorful flowers . Yield increases range from 9% to 15% , with a mean of 12% . <p> Flowers and ornamental plants propagated by cuttings , such as geraniums and a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooting , with greater plant heights and dry weight . There are also significant reductions in the time needed to grow a marketable product . <p> Cereal grains , including rice , wheat , barley , oats , and rye , show yield increases ranging from 25% to 64% , resulting from a rise in carbon fixation and reduction in photo-respiration . Flag leaves , the ones closest to grain panicles or heads , show a 60% increase in photosynthetic rates . <p> Other food crops , including corn , sorghum , millet , and sugarcane , show yield increases ranging from 10% to 55% , resulting primarily from superior efficiency in water use . <p> Tuber and root crops , including potatoes and sweet potatoes , show dramatic increase in tuberization ( potatoes ) and growth of roots ( sweet potatoes ) . Yield increases range from 18% to 75% . <p> Legumes , including peas , beans , and soybeans , show yield increases of 28% to 46% . For soybeans , frequently planted not only for their food value but because they naturally fertilize the soil , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be shown below . <p> Aquatic plants are commonly limited in their growth by a shortage of carbon dioxide . Carbon dioxide enrichments induce three- to five-fold increases in algal biomass when light and mineral nutrients , especially phosphorus , are plentiful . <p> In lakes and ponds with severe pollution , a higher C02 concentration may therefore accentuate the danger of oxygen depletion through a buildup in algae population . This could lead to the death of fish , as happened in Lake Erie until there was a major reduction in pollutants , including phosphates . Aquatic species with foliage above the water , such as the water hyacinth , produce about 40% more biomass when the C02 concentration is doubled . Such an increase could aggravate an already serious weed problem in fresh water lakes and streams . <p> The benefits of carbon dioxide enrichment are well-known among commercial growers of flowers and vegetables . Paul Nielsen , a rose grower in Santa Barbara , California , puts carbon dioxide into his greenhouse every morning before the vents are opened . " We find that roses respond well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Nielsen . " The stems are larger and thicker , and there are more stems per plant . " <p> Dick Oglevee , of Connellsville , Pennsylvania , is America 's largest grower of geraniums . From the beginning of September through . " More carbon dioxide gives us stronger stalks , better breaking , and more cuttings per week , " says Oglevee . " I wish we could do this in the summer too , but it 's too hot to keep the vents closed . " <p> Richard Gerhart , a cucumber and tomato grower in North Ridgeville , Ohio , is also a big fan of C02 enrichment : " Half the dry matter in a tomato or cucumber is carbon , and the only place that comes from is carbon dioxide in the air . " Gerhart maintains a 600 ppm concentration in his greenhouses , except on cloudy days , when he gets even better results by raising the concentration to 800-1,000 ppm . <p> American commercial greenhouses have used carbon dioxide fertilization for tomatoes , lettuce , cucumbers , flower and foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The benefits of this enrichment were first discovered by nurserymen in Germany 100 years ago , and the practice is widely used in Sweden , Denmark , Holland , Germany , Australia , and Japan , as well as the United States and Canada . Carbon dioxide enrichment is economical when greenhouse vents can be closed . It is therefore used most often in winter in northern areas and in the southerly latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere . <p> It is also standard practice for laboratory scientists working with algae cultures to conduct their research in C02-enriched environments . " Most experiments with algae are conducted at C02 concentrations of up to 20,000 ppm , " says N.E. Tolbert , professor emeritus of biochemistry at Michigan State University . " Cultures that can be grown in three days at high levels Of C02 would require 10 to 14 days at the normal atmospheric concentration . " <p> Phenomenal Response in Trees <p> Some of the most convincing evidence that the rising level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is good for plants comes from the response measurement of individual trees and overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's land area , and account for two-thirds of global photosynthesis . <p> Trees and their seedlings grown under controlled environments or in open top chambers simulating the outdoors have shown remarkable growth responses to elevated levels of C02 . Practically every species evaluated thus far in the seedling stage has shown a positive response . Addition of carbon dioxide to black walnut seedlings  --  at concentrations of 1,000 to 2,000 ppm for three months  --  increases dry weight by 80% , height by 96% , and leaf area by 79% . Similar results have been obtained for sugar maple , oak , ash , sweet gam , pine , and eucalyptus . The forestry department at Michigan State University has produced plantable trees in months , rather than years , by subjecting seedlings to 1,000 PPM C02 concentrations under optimal conditions of light , temperature , day length , and nutrients . <p> The Water Conservation Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has compared the growth of orange trees under the current atmospheric C02 concentration of 360 ppm , and a concentration of 650 ppm . The trees at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years , and in their first two years of production produced 10 times more oranges . <p> Deeper Breathing Biosphere <p> If plants respond so well to additional carbon dioxide , then we would expect to see positive responses to the substantial increase in atmospheric C02 over recent decades . Several pieces of evidence suggest exactly such a response . <p> A fascinating report was published by scientists with the Finnish Forest Research Institutes in the April 3 , 1992 issue of Science magazine . The researchers reported a 25% to 30% increase in the growing stock of forests in Austria , Finland , France , Sweden , Switzerland , and West Germany between 1971 and 1990 , and attributed this growth in part to a 9% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide during the same period . <p> Hartwell Allen , a plant scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Agricultural Research Service in Gainesville , Florida , has estimated that soybean yields have increased by 13% because of a rise in global carbon dioxide concentration . Another source of dramatic evidence for rising biological productivity comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the terrestrial vegetation of the earth is in the Northern Hemisphere , so more photosynthesis takes place in the spring and summer than in the fall and winter . The carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere begins to fall in the spring , and continues to fall through the summer months , as C02 is removed by the vegetative cover of the north . In late autumn , at least in northern latitudes , much of this vegetation dies and decomposes , and photosynthetic activity drops to a low level ; much of the carbon sequestered over the growing season is then returned to the air as C02 . <p> This oscillation in the C02 level is called the " biosphere 's breath , " and its amplitude is measured by the Mauna Loa recording station in Hawaii . When the first records were made in 1959 , there was a 6.5 ppm difference in C02 concentration between summer and winter . Last year , the difference was 7.5 ppm . What this means is astonishing-during their major growing seasons , the plants of the Northern Hemisphere have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did 33 years ago . <p> Other Important Benefits <p> Besides greater efficiency in photosynthesis and a reduction in water loss , higher levels of carbon dioxide provide other important benefits for plants . <p> Rising levels of C02 help compensate for the deficiencies in light that frequently occur in the winter months in northern Europe , Canada , and the United States . Indeed , flowers and vegetables grown in C02-enriched greenhouses experience an even higher-percentage boost in plant productivity under very low light intensities than under normal light . <p> Enrichment of the air by carbon dioxide also appears to offer some protection to plants against both extremely hot and cold temperatures . There is also evidence that high atmospheric levels of C02 raise the optimal temperature for plant growth . The implication of this for the global warming debate is significant-if the higher C02 world of the future leads to higher temperatures , plants will respond favorably both to increases in carbon dioxide and to the warmer conditions . <p> Plant responses to a higher carbon dioxide concentration do appear to be limited by deficiencies in nitrogen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of future C02-enriched atmospheres , it may be necessary to apply more fertilizer in many parts of the world . Even so , higher C02 levels have a remarkably stimulatory effect on biological nitrogen fixation by legumes , such as soybeans . <p> Elevated concentrations of C02 also offer protection against air pollutants . The partial closing of the stomata at higher C02 levels reduces exposure to ozone , sulfur dioxide , nitrous oxides , and other harmful substances in the air . The benefits are particularly pronounced for soybeans and other legumes that are especially sensitive to air pollutants . <p> Good News for the Planet <p> The benefits to plants that would result from a doubling of the carbon dioxide concentration do not necessarily mean that such a doubling is good for the planet . We do not know what the optimal level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is . So many variables could be affected by a major increase in C02 , including temperature and a redistribution of water resources , that the honest observer has to conclude he does not really know what will happen . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to project a number of features of the global ecosystem in the next century . <p> First , we can expect a rapid expansion of food production that may offset some of the presumed adverse climate effects . As crop yields rise with higher C02 levels , the amount of land devoted to agriculture can decline . It will be much easier to protect environmentally sensitive land areas from over-cultivation for crops . <p> Plants , directly or indirectly , provide 95% of the total food of the earth . Since plants are at the bottom of the food chain , a boost in plant production should lead to major increases in bird , fish , and mammal populations as well . <p> The rising carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere must be viewed with caution . But it is inappropriate for public discussion of the issue to focus only on the hypothetical danger of global warming that might result from higher carbon dioxide levels . It is important to stress as well the known benefits of a higher carbon dioxide concentration for the productivity of food crops , trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ILLUSTRATION : Plant <p> By Sylvan H.
