For the Russian Air Force , it was the stuff of instant legend . The elusive rebel in crisp combat fatigues drives into an open field under a starry Chechen sky to speak on his satellite phone . As he talks , an unseen Russian plane far above is hunting him . It locks in on his satellite signal , launches its missiles and blasts the field . Jokhar Dudayev , the flamboyant and impassioned leader of Chechnya 's rebellion against Russia , is dead . <P> Of course , it might not really have happened that way . This was the version put out on Russian television , but Dudayev has used his satellite phone often , and one mystery of the war has been that the Russians have never tracked its signal to target him . There was no explanation of how they suddenly managed it . The Russian army commander in the region , General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov , gave a completely different explanation . After first denying that there had been any fighting , he then claimed his forces did fire shells at the Chechens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed Dudayev . <P> However it happened , though , Dudayev is gone . Yeltsin has said publicly that his re-election could depend on the outcome of the Chechen war ; and in the short term , the elimination of the charismatic rebel , who had turned himself into a personal nemesis for Yeltsin , may look like a success and give the President a boost . In the longer run , the abrupt end of Dudayev 's one-man leadership could result in splits and instability among the Chechen rebel commanders and make a settlement even harder to reach . Still , Yeltsin will no doubt be glad Dudayev is finished . The dapper , mustached former Soviet Air Force general had the infuriating habit of outwitting and outlasting Russian troops , turning up on television and giving interviews to inquiring correspondents . <P> " With or without Dudayev , " Yeltsin said last week , " we shall wind up everything in Chechnya with peace . " That still seems a far-off objective . Yeltsin 's March 31 announcement of a cease-fire and an attempt at new negotiations brought no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week with visiting President Bill Clinton at his side , Yeltsin insisted that " military actions are not going on " in Chechnya . Was he lying or out of touch with reality ? <P> Perhaps neither of those extremes . Yeltsin had issued hold-back orders but gave the military considerable latitude in how to carry them out . As an administration official says , " I do n't think Yeltsin is lying  --  from his point of view . He would n't lie to Bill Clinton . From his own perspective , it 's a matter of what comprises a military operation . The way he sees it , the Russians are n't planning any big operations ; the troops are just defending themselves . " However Yeltsin views the conflict , it still looks very much like a war . Two weeks ago , Chechen rebels ambushed a Russian convoy and killed more than 70 soldiers . Last week they attacked Russian positions with rifles and grenades dozens of times each day , and the Russians responded with artillery and air strikes .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
