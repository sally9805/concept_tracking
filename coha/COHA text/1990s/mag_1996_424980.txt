MAGIC POTIONS Just a Regular Guy WHEN Michael Huffington spent $28 million to run for a California Senate seat , it may have taken a bigger piece of his family fortune than people thought . A Washington source says that his wife , author/conservative philosopher Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington , has been quietly hawking Herbalife , a controversial nutrition product . After all , every little bit helps . Some health experts have questioned the contents of Herbalife , and the tactics used by its distributors ( think Amway ) have come under attack . Mrs. Huffington , according to the source , has even gone to her good friend Newt Gingrich , trying to interest the Speaker of the House in using or distributing the product . Huffington did not return phone calls . " Gingrich demurred , " says the source . " He has enough to worry about . " GRAY MATTER About Men AS THE Sulzberger family squabbles over succession at The New York Times , a previously unheralded " heir " has emerged : thirty-nine-year-old George Alexanderson , who claims to be Arthur " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born to Times reporter Lillian Bellison Alexanderson in 1957 . That year , she filed a paternity suit against Sulzberger , who was then the assistant to the publisher ; Sulzberger denied being the father . He did , however , agree to pay the woman $41,000 over sixteen years because , his lawyers said , he wanted to avoid publicity . Now , amid the battle over who will take the Times into the twenty-first century  --  heir apparent Arthur " Pinch " Sulzberger Jr . may not be so apparent  --  Alexanderson 's name has once again surfaced . " He has been a specter here for years , " says one source . " Now he has rematerialized . " MYOPIA Inside Hillary 's Briefs SOME Beltway insiders are grousing that CBS 's White House correspondent , Elita Braver , is a bit too close to her subject . Braver is married to lawyer Bobert Barnett , of Washington-based Williams &; Connolly , who was once President Clinton 's personal attorney . Barnett recused himself when his wife got the White House beat , but he remains close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barnett testified at the Whitewater hearings  --  a subject Braver regularly covers . What 's more , several publishing insiders say that Barnett , who also negotiates publishing deals ( Ben Bradlee , William Bennett , and James Carville are clients ) , worked on Hillary Clinton 's contract for It Takes a Village . Publisher Simon &; Schuster denies this , saying the attorney was James Fuller , a Williams &; Connolly tax lawyer . A Barnett defender says , " Braver and Barnett have managed to keep the issues separate . " But another insider is less sanguine : " It 's just too close for comfort . " Sort of like if a president 's wife ran his health-care agency . SECRETS Brevity Is the Soul of Lingerie THERE MUST be something about the life of a madam that makes a woman want to stay close to underwear . When Heidi Fleiss " retired " from her lucrative Hollywood business , she went on to make boxer shorts . Now the Mayflower Madam , Sydney Biddle Barrows , is getting into lingerie , as it were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade ago , she tried her hand at selling real estate , being a talk-show host , writing , lecturing , and running a consulting agency . According to a fashion-world source , Barrows is now giving advice on being sexy to those Victoria 's Secret models . Barrows recently pitched in backstage at the lingerie company 's fashion show , helping the girls adjust their G-strings , et cetera . Barrows insists she 's not working for Victoria 's Secret but would n't comment on who was paying her to help at the show . " I hate to be obnoxious , " she quite sweetly said , " but I have no comment . There are some areas of my life that I just have to keep private . " She 's so well-mannered . KINKS That Costs Extra JADE , that psychosexual thriller ( not ) , did n't exactly make a killing at the box office , but several Hollywood sources say it was also hit by some unexpected expenses . Paramount paid Showgirls screenwriter Joe Eszterhas $2.5 million for the script , then turned it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friedkin and the already hirsute Eszterhas . Friedkin made so many changes to the script , say some film insiders , that Eszterhas wanted his name taken off the credits . " Why pay millions for an Eszterhas script if you ca n't bill it as a Joe Eszterhas film ? " asks one Hollywood source . So when Paramount gave Eszterhas a deal worth $2 million to $4 million for a blind commitment to his next script , Hollywood cynics derided it as an " incentive " to keep his name on Jade . Eszterhas denies the story , calling it " deeply malicious and untrue . " He adds , " I liked Jade very much and look forward to working with Billy Friedkin in the near future . " That may be so , says one source , as , Friedkin had been mentioned as a possible director for Eszterhas 's next movie , One Night Stand . That project , however , has been taken over by Leaving Las Vegas director Mike Figgis . Such plot twists . VIRTUAL REALITY CHECK Psst . Wan na See Delta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or supermodel on-line is child 's play . But for really embarrassing pictures of celebrities , check out Before They Were Stars ( http : **49;0;TOOLONG ) . Based on the television show of the same name starring Chachi himself , Scott Baio , BTWS features such photographic treasures as Diane Sawyer in the 1963 Junior Miss Pageant , Seinfeld 's Michael Richards , as a contestant on The Dating Game , and a fourteen-year-old Mick Jagger in a rock-climbing video . And , yes , he already had some big ol ' lips . NUMEROLOGY Lotsa Luck Now entering the ever-expanding magazine lottery is a magazine about , well , the lottery . A source says that the New York State Lottery Commission is drawing up plans to produce a monthly magazine devoted to those lucky numbers . The projected circulation : one million readers . What 's more , there is talk of another plan to bring out a national lottery magazine , giving the winning numbers of games across the country as well as profiles of winners . Some say the readership goal for that magazine is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very optimistic , " says a source . " But , hey , you never know . " If only Ed Idahon would get his sweepstakes magazine off the ground ... OLD TRICKS The Case of the Counterfeit Case FIRST THERE was Checkers . Then came Pat Nixon 's " good Republican cloth " coat . And , of course , there was that little Watergate problem . Now scandal has followed Richard Nixon beyond death ( and Oliver Stone ) . This one involves his favorite briefcase . John Taylor , executive director of the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda , California , recently told C-SPAN how Morocco 's King Hassan II presented the predisgraced president with a gift , a fine leather attache case from Cartier ( possibly the one he is carrying so proudly below ) . Nixon carried around the briefcase for a few weeks , but then the hinge broke . It was taken to Cartier , where the staff instantly recognized it as a cheap knockoff . " Taylor said that Nixon still insisted on carrying it around , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though it was a counterfeit . " Though the Nixon Library is trying to erase the tape , so to speak , saying , " There 's nothing there . Taylor was speaking off-the-cuff , " another source says Nixon 's office was forced to recant its story after getting complaints from the Moroccan government . Or maybe from the street vendor who actually sold the briefcase . AFTERLIVES Acquitting Himself TIME correspondent James Willwerth is taking a leave of absence from the magazine , and sources say it 's to ghostwrite a book for O. J. Simpon 's longtime friend and baggage handler Bobert Kardashian . That surprised publishing insiders , who remember that Willwerth wrote a piece that became notorious around Time because it presented a defense of the cuddly Mark Fuhrman . Willwerth , citing a nondisclosure agreement , refused to discuss his book project . He did , however , say that " in hindsight , it was embarrassing to have done the Fuhrman article . We all learn . " But , snips one source , " right now , O. J. 's lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " MEDICINE Take Two Lesbians and Call Me in the Morning IN Howard Stern 's latest book , Miss America , the media god reveals his very personal ( and strange ) battle with obsessive-compulsive disorder . The following letter on Stern 's behavior was written to his wife , Alison , by Jeffrey M. Schwartz , M.D. , an associate research professor at UCLA and the author of Brain Lock , a forthcoming book on OCD : Dear Alison : Do you ever wonder why your husband , Howard Stern , an obviously intelligent and successful man , does the sort of things he describes in his new book , Miss America ? Why he dresses in women 's clothes , masturbates to bondage videos ? ... Why he is chronically abusive to callers , guests , and colleagues on his radio show ? ... Why your husband is so fixated on images of anal penetration ? ... It is due to a powerful fear of intimacy , intense feelings of insecurity , and emotional vulnerability on the part of the person " turned on " by the perversion .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds offensive in order to get his revenge because society is viewed emotionally as an extension of his parents .... You might want to suggest that he begin with his problems of premature ejaculation and compulsive masturbation ....
