<p> The city 's plan to retain and attract manufacturers through the use of Planned Manufacturing Districts in reality usurps the ability of communities and their elected officials to pursue their best interests . <p> Property owners in those PMD areas zoned for manufacturing are constrained from seeking zoning variances for buildings not suitable for manufacturing , such as multistory buildings . This prevents commercial and residential loft development in the districts . <p> Although the city is not compelled to grant a zoning variance , there are clearly instances when they are in order . Those situations are monitored by the alderman and community groups responsible for their neighborhoods . <p> Since 1950 , the city has lost more than 400,000 manufacturing jobs . There is no evidence that even one of these jobs was lost because an obsolete industrial building was converted to commercial or residential use . On the contrary , improving an abandoned or underused property encourages businesses to stay in a neighborhood . <p> The Goose Island PMD on the Near North Side has prevented any major development in that blighted area for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately $ 12 million in property taxes during that period . A mixed-use development in that location likely would have produced about $ 272 million in property tax revenue . <p> The excess funds could have been used to develop other areas . <p> The South Side is home to more than 4.5 million feet of industrial space . Building infrastructure for new industrial parks and cleaning up brownfields could produce thousands of desperately needed jobs . <p> Chicago needs to make an effort to retain and recover manufacturing jobs . Misguided government intervention in Near North and Near West side neighborhoods that are undergoing dramatic progress is not the answer . <p> Residential and commercial development of the neighborhoods surrounding the Loop have attracted manufacturers back to the city . A well-thought-out plan to persuade them to establish industrial concerns at a reasonable distance from their residences could be very successful . <p> Eli Fishman , owner <p> Abbey Mfg . Co. , <p> Near West Side <p> By any other name <p> Regarding the nation 's Republican governors and members of Congress attempting to change the name of Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slap in the face to the working men and women of this country . <p> Here are our elected officials attempting to rename an airport , of all things , after the man responsible for the firing of every air traffic controller in this country  --  12,000 PATCO union members . <p> How soon we forget . The air traffic strike of 1984 was for better wages and benefits , decreased working hours , and to pressure the government to update the equipment to make takeoffs and landings safer . <p> To name an airport after the PATCO union buster is the purest form of disrespect I 've seen in recent times . It thumbs its nose at every union member in this country . <p> Mike Peterson , <p> Crown Point , Ind . <p> Think globally <p> American youths should begin learning a foreign language as early as elementary school , as do foreign students . <p> We live in a global world and our youths should prepare themselves linguistically to communicate in and understand other languages . <p> And as an incentive for foreign language studies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign languages . Too often , we direct more emphasis on sports achievements . We should reverse this trend and direct more energy and resources toward academic achievements . <p> Tony Mathis , Chicago Heights <p> The dark horse <p> When I co-founded Republicans for Fair Media nearly three years ago , our primary goal was to encourage fair treatment of the Republican Party in the press . Fair Media does not support one GOP candidate over another . <p> I 've found , on the whole , a majority of the media use a high level of professionalism to inform the public . The one area in which the mainstream press lacks objectivity is in its treatment of political candidates . Often , the media subjectively decide whether an individual 's candidacy is viable or not . A prime example of is the coverage of the Illinois governor 's race . <p> On the Republican side , Secretary of State George Ryan has virtually been handed the GOP nomination by the news media . It can be acknowledged that Ryan is the overwhelming favorite for that office . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conservative from Gilberts best remembered for some controversial pro-life ads he ran during the 1996 senatorial campaign . <p> The Republican Party has ignored Koppie 's candidacy and the media have followed their lead by relegating him to a political afterthought . It is totally within reason to say the Koppie campaign has an uphill battle , but that assessment should be left to the voters . <p> Julia Mary Zanoza , <p> acting director , <p> Republicans for Fair Media , <p> Crestwood <p> Taking out the trash <p> We , the neighbors and business people near the site where the Jeremiah Mearday incident occurred , wish to thank the police for their continued concern and rapid response to our calls . A number of us felt that gang violence and drug activity would escalate as a result of this incident . <p> Not so . The hoodlums who ruin our property values and destroy our peace of mind have a continuing fight on their hands . <p> Alert , law-abiding citizens backed by police can and will remove the destructive elements that blight this neighborhood . <p> Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control Co. , <p> Humboldt Park <p> Saluting the General <p> To compare Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight ( editorial , Dec. 22 ) to Dennis Rodman , Roberto Alomar and Mike Tyson is almost as bad as comparing Northwestern 's Kevin O'Neal to Fabio . <p> Let us not vilify a successful coach for refusing to cater to those blue-chip athletes who have been treated like superstars since the seventh grade . <p> Knight has continued an obviously successful formula in college coaching that breaks down the selfish , egomaniacal star athlete and then builds him back up to a team player . Through hard work , dedication and understanding , players who " fit the Knight mold " will prosper and succeed . <p> It seems to me that it is not coach Knight who has changed for the worse . It is the athletes who are the ones to blame for Indiana 's recent lack of success . <p> In a world where athletes no longer admire their coaches , elders and opponents , we should be embracing the Bobby Knights for trying to keep star athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Acts of heroism <p> Recently two Chicago firefighters risked their lives to save the lives of children , an event the Sun-Times ( news story , Jan. 1 ) buried on Page 10 . <p> It is a shame our society is so quick to prosecute with headlines of wrongdoing and slow to praise heroism . My husband leaves four children to risk his life , to save other people 's lives , children and property . These men deserve better than Page 10 . <p> Christine Thelen , <p> Garfield Ridge <p> Fans lose again <p> College football still does n't get it . Once again , the battle for the so-called " national championship " has been decided in the polls and not on the field . <p> Is n't it any wonder that the Bowl Alliance has been a joke ? That the bowls have lost their luster , and that the TV ratings continue to go down year after year ? It 's obvious that there is a demand for a legitimate national championship . But the NCAA does n't want to put the bowl people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan and Nebraska could settle this where it should be settled , on the playing field . Unfortunately , it never will happen . Thanks , NCAA , for another anticlimactic season . <p> Greg Owens , Wheaton <p> Yin and yang <p> Siamese twins : On one side is Dr. Jack Kevorkian , the " angel of death " ; on the other is Richard Seed , who fancies himself a deity by saying he will produce humans through cloning ( news story , Jan. 7 ) . <p> Megalomania knows no boundary . <p> Laszlo M. Mogyorossy , <p> Libertyville <p> By e-mail <p> The human soul <p> In Dennis Byrne 's column ( Jan. 8 ) , Richard Seed has proclaimed his equality with God , thereby assuming he has power to create a human being . <p> Only God can issue a soul , but it must be born of a woman to assume humanity . That is where Seed can not cross the line . <p> Toni Strzempa , Archer Heights
