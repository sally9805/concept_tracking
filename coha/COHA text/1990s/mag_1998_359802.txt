In Richard Dooling 's brilliant new novel , Brain Storm , Judge Whittaker Stang , a Howard Cosell in robes , scolds an attorney who wants to try the killer of a " disabled person of color " for a hate crime rather than simple murder . The ambitious lawyer thinks that will make him look cuddly and electable in a run for the Senate . Throbbing with scorn , Stang tears into him : " Are we going to impanel a jury to inquire after just what kind of hate this degenerate had running around inside his head ? And after we identify all the warped , deviant varietals of hatred ... ask the jury which kind of hate made him pull the trigger ? Not in my courtroom . Not if I can help it . " <P> And not in my column . Well , maybe not . It is easy enough to mock the idea of hate crimes ( " So where are the love crimes ? " ) . Hate-crime legislation , critics say , is codified redundancy , unnecessary complication for real-world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Judge Stang says , you do n't want to send hate off to the forensic lab to prove what kind it is . Unlike intent , he says , motive is n't a separate element of a crime . It simply provides narrative to sway a jury or give plot to a novel . <P> But sometimes we need to find motive to calm us down . Then hate-crime laws , for all their inconsistencies , seem to be the only resort . As night fell at the vigil for Matthew Shepard outside the Capitol last Wednesday , the stony resistance of many Republicans to federal hate-crime legislation melted amid rosy predictions it would be revived , and passed , when Congress resumes in January . <P> But this could be no more than a feel-good gesture at the end of a feel-bad session . The G.O.P. has thrown its right-wing base enough Grade A red meat to satisfy the most ravenous appetite . The right wing 's " war against the homosexual agenda " is actually against homosexuals themselves . In fighting to limit AIDS funding and battling gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less deserving of basic rights and as a sinful , diseased threat to the American way of life . There was , of course , Senator Trent Lott 's comparison of homosexuality to kleptomania . Now a coalition of Christian-right groups is running full-page ads in newspapers with the message that homosexuals are so lost it will take divine intervention for them to become normal . With plans to put the ads on TV just before the election , an entire wing of the party looks poised to fan hatred of gays just to get out the vote . <P> Words are one thing . Sticks and stones are another . There were nearly 8,759 hate crimes reported in 1996 ; 1,016 of those were sex-bias crimes . Although no one thinks that Wyoming , which has quashed hate-crime bills three times , wo n't fully prosecute Shepard 's killers , gay lobbyists have no doubt that there are cases in which the police look the other way , prosecutors do n't bring charges and juries do n't convict . Take the case of Jonathan Schmitz , who killed a gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Show that he had a crush on Schmitz . Schmitz was convicted of second-degree murder . Was being the object of gay affection such understandable humiliation that the charges were ameliorated ?
