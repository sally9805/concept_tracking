But nowhere has she been more effective than in her campaign for mentally ill people , an issue she adopted in 1970 when Jimmy Carter was elected governor of Georgia .

" It passed in September , Jimmy was defeated in November , and by February , it was gone , " Rosalynn says flatly , recalling the dismantling of the bill by a new administration . " I think that was the most distressing thing that ever happened to me . " To continue their mission , the Carters founded The Carter Center in 1982 . With a staff of 200 people and representatives in 20 countries , the center 's programs address the issues of health , democracy and development , and urban revitalization throughout the world .
