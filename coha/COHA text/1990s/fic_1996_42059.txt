IF LIBBY COE HAD BOUGHT her tomatoes at Kroger , she would probably never have killed Tracy Whitt . There was even another roadside vendor on Franklin Road who sold homegrown tomatoes , and she could have stopped there , but one smotheringly humid day , on Long Hollow Pike , she had seen an old woman sitting in a pink-flowered housedress selling produce under the strange-colored shade of a blue tarpaulin . The tomatoes really were homegrown ; Libby could see the plants growing in tidy rows in a big garden near the highway , and she chose a small basket , which the woman carefully unloaded into a plastic supermarket bag before looking up and saying , without smiling , " One dollar and twenty-five cents . No checks . " <p> Libby handed her two dollar bills , and the woman reached into a red coffee can to retrieve the change . First , however , she had picked up another coffee can and spit into it a cloudy brown stream . The can was half full already , and Libby felt herself pale with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guilt remained , mysteriously , and was intensified by the sight of a shirtless man , maybe twenty or twenty-one , lurking in the shade of the porch . An old man , the woman 's husband Libby supposed , mechanically picked tomatoes in the blistering sun , and the young man stood in the shade watching . He turned , almost in slow motion , toward where Libby stood waiting for her change , and though his eyes were in shadow , she clearly saw his stringy hair , his lean , hairless chest , and his surprisingly long middle finger as he calmly raised his hand and shot her a bird . Between them , on the patchy grass , were a child 's Big Wheel , painted like a ladybug , and an upturned foil pie pan , catching the light . <p> Libby Coe was a modest , churchgoing woman . That was how she described herself when she joined a ladies ' prayer group , modest and churchgoing , and she said this with lowered eyes , hands in the lap of her pressed khaki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord expects much more from me . " She had n't meant to sound pathetic , but she thought with embarrassment that she did . <p> She used to belong to one of the Ladies ' Missionary Societies ; they all called them " Circles , " but the one Libby had belonged to for years had gradually changed as one member after another had gone and taken a job . At first Libby had felt left out , but then she felt guilty . Women came to the evening meetings in dresses now , sometimes suits , having come straight from work , and Libby was ashamed that she had been in shorts all day , and then had time to change into a fresh skirt and shirt . One of the women , Helen Shea , began every meeting by reciting how much she had done that day . <p> " I 've got two more stops before I get home tonight , " she said one evening . " It 's impossible for one person to get everything done that I have to do in a day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juggling home and business . " It seemed to Libby that Helen was looking at her , and she felt lazy and inconsequential . <p> Libby and the few others who had n't gone to work yet felt guilty , but the ones who had jobs felt guilty , too , Libby realized . Helen apologized for bringing packaged cookies one night , and Libby noticed that one of the others apologized for having time to bake a coffee cake . " I had a meeting get canceled this afternoon , " the woman said , " or I would never have had time to do this . " <p> One by one , as they realized how large the college bills were going to be , they were absorbed into banks and insurance companies , typing , sorting , answering the phone , and describing those things as more . Libby believed that most of them would have preferred not to work . <p> " It would n't be so bad if Cliff did n't blame me for having to work . He acts like it 's something I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help around the house than he did before I went to work , " one of them said one day after church . <p> " Do you think he feels like his manhood is threatened ? " Libby had seen this on a talk show . <p> " I suppose so , but the fact is , I did n't do it . It was either this or go into debt up to our ears . We agreed to this . I 'd rather stay home with Laura , but with Melanie starting at Western next year , we just could n't afford for me to . " <p> Jean had been trained as a nurse , and was able to go back to that , but there was nothing Libby could go back to . She had gone to college two years , majoring in education , but never finished . After Dodd graduated , they got married , and that was that . Libby could n't remember even thinking about whether she should finish school , and her mother and daddy had n't questioned it , either . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old , president of the youth group at Spring Road Methodist , and it seemed the most natural thing in the world to entrust Libby to him . She had n't started dating Dodd until she was sixteen  --  that was how old her daddy said she had to be  --  but they never really stopped dating after that . Dodd was eighteen and a senior , and the next year he went to Middle Tennessee State College on <p> scholarship , so of course that 's where Libby started two years later . Neither of them had lived on campus , but rode together in Dodd 's car to Murfreesboro for classes . They hardly even missed a Sunday at church , and both of them taught Sunday school classes . When they got married , every member of the church was there . Libby 's mother still talked about the two thousand handmade butter mints they went through at the reception , and Dodd took over the used car portion of his father 's Ford dealership the next week . He had always made a good living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore , so Libby , feeling uneasy , did n't pledge the next year . <p> About the only ones left not working were Frances Peeler and Millie Sutton . They had never been Libby 's cup of tea  --  they went to spiritual retreats and talked about the Lord working in their lives in a way that made it clear they looked down on people who did n't hear the Lord speaking to them regularly . Libby thought they looked down on her , too , so she was surprised when Frances called her one morning and asked if she would like to join their prayer group : " We have found that there is a spiritual need unmet by conventional religious services , and this is a loving way to support one another in our prayer life . " <p> The loving support part made Libby a little nervous , and she was n't sure she had a prayer life , but she went anyway . At that first meeting one of the women gave a talk about prayer . The woman said that life could be a prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prayer . Libby did n't think she was a very spiritual person , but she did think she was tidy . She thought this as she stood in her kitchen later that afternoon . There was a set of ceramic canisters shaped like houses , and she brushed carefully around the little windows with a toothbrush dipped in bleach , trying to get out that funny greasy kitchen dirt that seemed forever to collect there . Libby was n't thinking about God ; she was trying to understand why there was dirt there in the first place , since the canisters were empty . She kept the flour and sugar in bags in the cabinets . She held the brush under the faucet , careful not to splash her blouse with bleach , and wondered , " Is this prayer ? " She did n't think so . This was her life . She liked the smell of bleach , and she liked for the little painted windows on the empty canister houses to be perfectly white . This was what she did , and what she thought about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord would be working through bleach and an old toothbrush . The fact was , she did n't believe the Lord would bother with her life when there were so many other lives more worthy and promising to work with . But , of course , that might be a blessing . <p> " I believe God requires more of me than just going to church , " Frances said one afternoon , a few weeks after Libby had joined the group . They had just finished reading Called to Serve , the latest book by a woman who was making all the talk shows . <p> " To whom much is given , much is expected , " she explained . They were in Frances 's house , and afternoon sun illuminated the lemon squares she had set out , like a tea party . Daintily gnawing the side of one , she added , " Ooh , these turned out well , if I say so myself . Have you had one , Millie ? " <p> " Not yet . " <p> " They 're good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lassiter was licking the tips of her fingers . " I want : you to write this recipe down for me . " She started rummaging for a pen . <p> " What more do you think is expected of you , Frances ? " Millie had assumed the role of moderator , trying to keep them on the subject . Ignoring Mary Ben , Frances sat back and took a deep breath . <p> " I think I should help people , " she said , looking around triumphantly . " I believe I have a call to help people . " <p> The women shifted and looked at each other . " Well , that 's really wonderful , Frances . Now the book says we have to learn to be more clear about our missions . Do you have . a specific idea in mind ? " <p> " What do you mean specific ? " <p> " You know , collect food baskets . Adopt a South American baby . " <p> " I guess I 'll have to think about it . " <p> " Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have n't said much yet . Have you been getting any feelings about what God might have called you to do ? " <p> She should have just said , " No , not yet , " but feeling a little guilty at not carrying her weight in the conversation , Libby said , " Well , I 've always thought I was called to be a good wife and mother . " <p> " I think you have more potential than that , " Millie said . She seemed startled . <p> " Well , I want to do something in my own right . " Frances looked offended . <p> " I think motherhood is what we were all called to . The hand that rocks the cradle ... " <p> " Oh , God , Mary Jean , not that again . " <p> " Well , that 's what I believe . " Everyone had begun talking at once . Libby had a sudden , dizzy sense of falling , and she gripped the arm of the chair to steady herself . The room 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to dance , and she wanted them all to be quiet for a minute , to be still . Finally Millie said , " Hey , y'all , one at a time , " and Libby knew her face was as red as a tomato . " Now this is a discussion . Is n't this great ? There 's nothing wrong with what Libby said , but we want to prayerfully examine what our calls mean in our day-to-day lives . Let 's talk about specifics . The leader 's guide says we should look for the small , everyday acts that define our ministry . What might Libby do today to answer her call to be a good wife and mother " <p> " She could take a parenting class . " <p> " Stephen is in college . It 's too late for that . " <p> " She could prepare a special meal for no special occasion . " <p> " Take cupcakes to Dodd 's office . " <p> Libby got over her embarrassment as the talk turned away from her ; each person had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever reason she wanted to . <p> She bought a copy of Gourmet magazine on the way home and was slicing shallots when Dodd came in that night . " Those are the scrawniest onions I 've ever seen , " he said , kissing the top of her head . " What are you making " <p> " They 're shallots , " she said . " It 's a new recipe . " <p> " Well , I 'm sure it 'll be great if you 're making it . " <p> She thought the balsamic vinegar smelled funny , but the instructions were clear about deglazing the pan where she browned the little pork tenderloins . Dodd covered it all with ketchup and ate heartily . <p> " Great porkchops , hon. " <p> Libby stood over the sink , rinsing plates . As the remains of Dodd 's ketchup washed into the sink and began to swirl around with the water , Libby was reminded of the famous shower scene in Psycho . She held the plate beneath the faucet as the last bit of red circled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel if it were her own blood . She realized with a dead calmness that she probably would n't feel anything . <p> " I wish it was my blood , " she whispered . " I swear I do . " <p> Frances and Millie and Mary Ben , all of them , really , seemed to have a magical power Libby did n't understand : a power to put things in different places in their lives , somehow , to segregate . To Libby it was all too much of a whole . If she and Dodd had an argument , which had only happened a few times in all these years , she hated him . She truly hated him for days . They had a speaker in Sunday school once who said you should be careful to say you hated what someone did , not the person , something like , " I love you , but I hate it when you ... " Libby listened and could not see the difference . What was the it ? " I hate it , " she tried saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt light and lifeless , like a june bug 's shell with no june bug in it , but everybody else was nodding , and several couples held hands , and she knew better than to speak , though she wanted to . <p> " What 's the difference ? " she had wanted to ask . " What 's the difference between hating what someone does and hating them , even if it 's only for a little while ? " What else was there to another person but what he or she did ? What he or she said ? That did n't tell you anything , everyone knew that , and anyway , there were plenty of times Libby had felt such seething hatred for someone after only hearing him or her talk that she knew she could never in a million years say " I hate it when you say ... " What she really would say , if she spoke , was " I hate you when you say ... " <p> Sometimes she was n't as ashamed as she knew she should be for feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever said those things out loud . It was n't like she ever did anything hateful . But still , she thought them , and knew she should n't have . <p> She could n't feel something with one part of her brain , that was her problem . She could n't make her life go into compartments like that . She wondered if , maybe , there was n't enough to her life to fill up one compartment , let alone two . But she could see that it was n't the same for everybody else . They could talk with tears in their eyes about helping the poor , and one week Frances organized a clothing drive for someone whose house had burned . It was n't anyone they knew ; it was one of those rental houses behind the Kroger , but they had heard about it at church , and the next thing , Frances had the sizes of all four children and had everyone bringing in clothes and dishes and Beanee Weenees . But the very next month she came in fuming about how her yardman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance his wages to buy a water pump . <p> " That man had the gall to tell me if he could n't drive , he could n't feed his family . As if someone like that needed all those awful children anyway . People like that should n't be allowed to have children . " <p> " You have to be firm with those people , or it never stops , " Millie had agreed . " Maybe next time he will think to put a little money away for emergencies . " <p> Sitting quietly , holding the morning 's devotional in her lap , Libby finally looked up . <p> " Is that the same man who 's always done your yard ? " she asked . <p> " Oh , yes , for twenty-five years . " <p> " Does n't he live out on Long Hollow Pike ? " <p> " I guess so . Why ? " <p> " He used to do odd jobs for my daddy . I thought it was the same man . " <p> Libby had decided she would drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cleaned the gutters for Dodd a few times , and she thought she would recognize him . As it turned out , he had moved , and Libby could n't find him , but that was how she came to find the Whitts ' roadside produce stand . <p> Libby 's daddy worked in an office his whole life , but he always had his six tomato plants trained against the wall of the toolshed , and when she was little , he always helped her set out two cherry tomato plants that were hers to tend . <p> " If it 's not homegrown , it just does n't taste like a tomato , " he said , but when they opened up the supermarket , Libby forgot about homegrown tomatoes . The produce there was arranged so neatly that Libby could n't imagine it had ever been in the dirt , or that nasty hands had ever touched it . <p> Still , when she saw the old woman watching her drive slowly down Long Hollow Pike , she remembered her daddy 's tomatoes . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the old woman , " but I was looking for Mr. Turley 's house . " <p> The woman did n't answer . <p> " I heard he 'd had some hard luck , and I thought I would see if I could help . He used to work some for my father . " <p> " They moved , " the old woman finally said . She turned slightly toward the house so that the webbing on her yard chair creaked . " Tracy , where 'd the Turleys move to ? " <p> Tracy had his hand back at his side by the time the old woman turned to him . He looked at her , then at Libby , and came down off the porch . He was older than he had looked in the shadow ; he was closer to twenty-five . When he stepped into the yard , two dogs scuttled out from under the steps and ran at his ankles , begging . <p> " Son of a bitch , " he said , kicking at one . <p> " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " It 's my grandson . " She had turned in the chair , suddenly friendly . <p> " Tracy , did n't they move over to Una ? " <p> " Hell , I do n't know where they moved to . " He came up and stood looking at Libby . Libby 's brothers would never have stood in the front yard shirtless , talking to a woman . He continued to stare while she put her change in her wallet . She felt prim and stiff , and she reddened . <p> " What you want them for ? " <p> " He used to work for my daddy . I just wanted to check on him and his family . " <p> " What for ? They owe you money ? " <p> " No . " <p> Tracy grinned at Libby , and she blushed again . " Well , I do n't know where they went , " he said . " It ai n't my business . " <p> " My daddy would have helped Mr. Turley if he ever needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he needed it . " <p> Tracy stood there , still grinning . " I did n't know old man Turley had so many fans . I could n't stand the son of a bitch . " With that , he turned and walked back toward the porch . <p> " Tracy got mad ' cause Mr. Turley would n't fix his car for him without him buying the parts first . He was tight . He saved ever ' dime , and they bought some land out past Una . That 's why they moved . He bought his own place . I did n't know of him having any trouble . My name is Bessie Gower , and that 's my grandson , Tracy Lee Whitt . " Tracy was standing still , with his back to them , obviously listening . <p> Mrs. Gower picked up her coffee can again , and Libby looked quickly away , toward the garden . Mr. Gower was at the end of the row , and he straightened . up , looking slowly around the field . This time Mrs. Gower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libby glanced back toward the house , and Tracy was still in the yard , bending over the fender of a car but watching out of the corner of his eye . She felt soft and white and exposed in her neat , pressed outfit , blue-and-white gingham shorts with a matching appliqu on the T-shirt . She wished for dirty blue jeans . <p> " Looks like y'all sure have a pretty garden . I bet you enjoy it . " Libby realized that her voice sounded strained and insincere , but Mrs. Gower was friendly now . <p> " If it was n't for this garden , I do n't know how we 'd make it . " She shook her head . " We never expected no help from nobody , but it 's been hard . I 'm too old to work , and so is my husband , but my youngest daughter done left her baby here , too , the poor little thing . I raised six of my grandchildren , starting with Tracy Lee , and now I 've got another . His mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be raising no other man 's kid . What was I going to do I did n't want the state to get him . This garden money is all I 've got to depend on , except Social Security , and that do n't go far when you 're raising little ones . " " Does n't Tracy help you ? " Libby regretted speaking as soon as it was out of her mouth . <p> " You know how this younger generation is . When he works , it 's all gone before he gets it . But work ai n't easy to find , and these supervisors treat a man like he ai n't nothing . Tracy wo n't put up with it , so they always have it in for him , he says . My James put up with plenty in his day , just to keep food on the table , but they do n't think that way anymore . " <p> Mrs. Gower was looking at Libby , and as soon as Libby looked back , the old woman smiled . " Did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too big , but Libby bought a large sackful anyway , and some knotty , dirty cucumbers with big- yellow bellies . <p> " Thank you very much , ma'am , " Mrs. Gower said , smoothing the front of her dress . " We appreciate your business , we really do . I do n't know what I 'd do without this little dab of money the garden brings in . " <p> As Libby walked to her car , she heard the woman yell , " Get out of that dirt . I told you not to play in that filthy mess , " and Libby saw a sticky , mournful child , three or four years old , sitting in the dust by the porch , wearing only dingy underpants . As Libby drove away , Mrs. Gower waved from her chair under the blue tarp . <p> " Now these taste like tomatoes , " Dodd said that night . " You get these at Kroger ? " <p> The next week , Libby almost stopped at a produce stand on Franklin Road where vegetables were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ponytail bustled around . There were two cars parked in the gravel of the shoulder , and Libby could see the people putting clean , round tomatoes into a small paper sack . That 's where she wanted to stop . But maybe the other people need my business more , she thought , as she speeded back up . God may be giving me a message . <p> What if it had been Jesus sitting under that blue tarp on Long Hollow Pike Jesus had a special place in His heart for the people no one else wanted anything to do with . " I 'm no better than the Pharisees , " she whispered . " Not one bit better . " So she headed to Long Hollow Pike . <p> Mrs. Gower was not by the road when she drove up , so Libby pulled into the driveway , careful not to run over any of the three or four dogs that bounded up , barking . When no face appeared at the screen , she got out and walked toward the house . Standing just off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She stepped onto the porch . Her white flats had wooden beads sewn in the shape of a flower on the toe , in the same color as her moss-green knit top . That there was a thin vinyl cushion the same color , though spotted with mildew , leaning against the metal frame of a kitchen chair on the porch made Libby feel ashamed again , and conspicuous . She knocked on the doorframe , careful to look across the yard and not into the room beyond the screen . " Mrs. Gower ? " She said this a little louder . She could hear the TV . <p> A scraping noise , and the TV got quiet , and in the silence Libby could smell cooking . Green beans ? Bacon She was sure Tracy saw her wrinkled nose when he appeared at the door . <p> " I was wondering if Mrs. Gower was home . I need some tomatoes . " <p> " Granny , you got a customer , " he yelled . He looked at Libby . Mrs. Gower came to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Granny , who is it ? " the child kept repeating . <p> " Why , it 's that nice lady from last week . " The child stood and stared at her . Libby smiled , but her face felt tight . She saw herself standing there as she was afraid she looked to these people : better than them . She did n't want to look better than anybody . She opened her eyes wider and wiped her hand on her print slacks , as if rubbing imaginary bacon grease from her hand might make them all be comfortable together . <p> " Why , hello there . What 's your name ? " Libby had never spoken this silly babytalk to her own son , and was surprised at how ridiculous she felt . The child solemnly wiped a wrist across his nose and took a step backward . Libby straightened . " How old did you say he was ? " <p> " The poor little thing 's almost four , " said Mrs. Gower . " Let me wipe your nose , Jamie . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money for a doctor , do n't you know . Them clinics , I wo n't go to them . I do n't like the way they treat you . " <p> Within an hour Libby was driving them to her doctor , and by the time she had bought the child some clothes and stopped by the grocery store , it was time to go home and cook supper for Dodd . There had been nothing wrong with the child . <p> " I know when a child is sick , " Mrs. Gower said as she greedily unpacked the groceries . " That was sure a nice waiting room , was n't it ? " <p> Libby stood in the kitchen watching the woman pile cans on the table . The house was a rectangle divided into four rooms with no hallway between , so that each room looked into the others , and she could see a small bedroom with clothes hanging on a hook behind a closet door . There was a dresser with one drawer-front missing , and what looked like fifty nail polish bottles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crocheted scarf , sat the TV and a foot-high stack of small magazines , probably TV Guide . Libby could see the 61d man sitting on the couch watching something , but she could tell he was also watching them . Though it was bright outside , the house was dim , like the light itself had become as stale as the air . <p> " Well , looky here , Jamie , ai n't this nice ? " Tracy had come into the kitchen and was opening a package of Oreos . <p> " I want one , Tracy , " Jamie said . " Give me one , Tracy , please . " Tracy held the package just out of his reach . " They 'll rot your teeth out . " <p> " You 'll ruin your supper , honey , now just hush , " Mrs. Gower said . Libby looked up , and Tracy was staring at her . He held out the bag . <p> " No , thank you , " she said . He gave her that hateful smile again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , and he took the bag and walked out the front door . <p> When Libby got outside , Tracy was leaning against her car , his back to her . She opened the door on her side , but he did n't turn around . She stood there a minute , uncertain . <p> " Well , I 'd better be getting home , " she said . He did n't turn . The cookie package , two-thirds full , lay on the front seat . " I 'll bet you have a real nice house , do n't you I saw your garage door opener . What 's your husband do ? " <p> " He has a car dealership . " <p> " A car dealership . " He turned and looked at her over the hood . " I 'll bet you could get him to give me a deal . " The sun was in her eyes , low over the edge of the shed by the driveway , and he was just a silhouette ; she could n't see his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I 'd have to talk to him , " she said . " I 'd better be going . " She moved around the car door , to get inside . <p> " He do n't even know you 're over here , does he ? " He came around and stood in front of her , the car door between them . He was barechested , and she could smell some kind of cologne , which startled her . She was ashamed that she thought people like that would n't have cologne , and she was ashamed to breathe it . <p> " What 're you doing over here ? What 're you looking for that he ai n't giving you ? " She got in the car , but his hand was on the door , and she could n't close it without being rude . <p> " I 've got to get home to cook supper . " <p> " What 're you looking for ? " <p> Libby felt blood flaming her face , and she could feel a strange tightness in her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment if she were having a heart attack . The sun had finally fallen below the roof of the shed , and in the shadow she could suddenly see Tracy 's eyes . They were hazel , sort of , but with more gold than she expected . Behind him the gravel in the driveway cast huge shadows , and she heard a singing in her ears that was her blood , or maybe a mosquito . After a second she looked back up at him . <p> " I 'm just trying to help . " <p> He leaned over and stared into her face for a moment , then turned and . went into the house , laughing mean and low . Shaking , Libby started down the drive , trying to move the car smoothly without throwing up dust ; she did n't want him to think she was running away . Still , when she pulled onto the highway , her wheels spun in the gravel , and when she shot too quickly into the road and hit her brakes , the tires squealed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was watching from the window . <p> Out of sight of the house , Libby began to feel unnaturally calm and even , and was aware of how deliberately and smoothly she turned her head to change lanes , how evenly she slowed to stop at the light on Franklin . She felt that if she did anything too quickly she might break , and blood would creep out all over her . It would start with a small crack you might not notice ; she imagined a tiny hairline fracture starting to pull apart at the back of her head until she popped out of her skin , smooth and tender as a blister . Suddenly it would give , she thought , and something all around her would fall away . Maybe it was already cracked . Maybe it was just a matter of time . <p> Frances had been talking nonstop for two months ' worth of meetings about a South American baby she was thinking of " adopting . " She was n't going to bring the child home , of course , she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture to put on the refrigerator . <p> " My problem , " she said , " is how do you know that the child is really deserving ? " <p> " How can a child not be deserving ? " Millie was poring over the children 's pictures . " Are n't they just the cutest , most pitiful things you 've ever seen ? " <p> " Well , I do n't mean the child , of course , I mean the family . What if they take the money and still do n't try to better themselves ? " <p> Mary Ben was rummaging around the cookie plate . " Well , I guess you 'd better pick an orphan , " she said . <p> " Do you think it 's for us to decide who 's deserving of our help ? " Libby was surprised at how firm her voice sounded . It was still a little voice , she had always known her voice would n't carry  --  but firm and abnormally calm . Frances looked at her . <p> " Well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given us . " <p> " I mean I wonder sometimes , am I helping somebody just to feel better about myself ? Do I want people to think I 'm good , is that why I do it How do I know who I ought to help If Jesus came to be helped , I do n't know that he would n't be dirty and nasty and disgusting , and that would be the point . He probably would n't even act like He appreciated it . Maybe we are n't supposed to decide who deserves it . " <p> " I certainly do n't believe He expects me to cast my pearls before the swine . " Frances sounded offended , but Libby did n't care . <p> " I 'm talking about me , Frances . I 'm just saying that if God sends me someone , maybe I should help them because I can , not because they deserve it . " <p> Frances began folding her brochures , looking hurt . " Did you see that Kroger had frozen turkey breasts two for one " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back to the Gowers ' , she did n't really . It was n't making her feel good , and she knew somehow that Dodd would n't want her to , if he knew . She had n't given them that much , but the nurse in her doctor 's office said Mrs. Gower had called , wanting to know if she could get the doctor to look at her . Did Libby intend to pay for that ? The nurse told Libby she felt she needed to ask before she gave the woman the appointment . <p> " I have n't felt good lately , " Mrs. Gower told Libby later that afternoon . " I do n't have no energy . I feel like my blood 's low , and those doctors in that clinic just do n't care . I sure would appreciate it if you would take me to your doctor . " Libby was trying to wash the child 's face . She looked up at Mrs. Gower . " Bessie , why is Jamie 's eye swollen ? " <p> " ' Cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door of the kitchen . " She wo n't make him mind , so I reckoned I would . " <p> " You hit this baby hard enough to make his eye swell ? " Libby stood up . <p> " You going to call the state on me ? Is that what you 're hanging around here for , trying to find out what we done wrong ? Why do n't you just tell us all how to live our lives , Miss Libby , so we 'll all be nice people , like you , driving nice cars , going to church . " <p> " He did not hit that baby . That 's a mosquito bite . They swell me up like that , too . " Mrs. Gower picked the child up . " Quit it , Tracy . I do n't know why you 'd even say something like that . " <p> Jamie started rubbing his eye and crying , and Libby could see the little white point of the insect bite . " It hurts , Granny . Can I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Libby looked at Mrs. Gower . The woman held the child , who was now eating cookies , and the crumbs that were n't sticking to his face were falling down the front of Mrs. Gower 's top . Libby felt sticky and dirty and wanted to wash her hands again , she wanted to get out of the dark , hot house , she wanted to go behind her own door and close it . She did n't want anyone to look at her or see her or watch her . <p> " I do n't know what 's wrong with him , I do n't . Nobody hit this child . " <p> " I guess I 'd better go . I 'm sorry . " Libby had sweat across her eyebrows , felt sticky all over ; she felt dampness around her bra , and between her legs , and she was ashamed of the way Mrs. Gower was looking at her . <p> She hurried out the door and across the gravel . She just wanted to get home , to her clean countertops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , Jesus was always walking solemnly through hot , dusty streets with ragged children chasing him . Their preacher said that they washed each other 's feet because they got so filthy walking in those hot streets in sandals . He said people emptied their chamber pots in the ditches at the side of the road , and that the beggars and blind men never washed . Jesus had to smell all that , and He still loved the people . Libby wanted to shower , and she hated that . <p> Tracy was again at her car , leaning on the hood . He looked her up and down . Libby saw herself , seersucker pants and white sandals . <p> " I 'm asking you again why you 're coming around here . " <p> Libby did n't answer , but opened her door . She had left the windows up , and a blast of heat hit her face . <p> " Do n't get in that car without answering me , bitch . " He grabbed the door . Libby got in , started the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick of you hanging around here like you 're Jesus Christ , throwing us scraps . If you want something your husband ai n't giving you , I can take care of that . I done it for a lot of old babes like you , and they loved it . Just let me in and we 'll drive down to the lake . " Libby had put the car in gear , but sat there with her foot on the brake . " Get away from the car , " she whispered . " Leave me alone . " <p> " You 're getting turned on , ai n't you , honey " <p> She tried to close the door , but he held it , so she grabbed the handle with both hands and yanked . Her foot slid off the brake , and the car started to roll slowly backward . Libby was sure she was about to run into the shed  --  that 's all she could see in her rearview mirror as she sat up  --  and she jammed the brake as hard as she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight slammed onto the gas pedal . Panicked , she looked in the rearview mirror again just as she hit the wall , and found herself looking directly into Tracy 's eyes . <p> It was an accident . She did n't know he had let go of the door , and she did n't know that he was circling behind the car . Maybe he was leaving , maybe he was trying to get in on the other side . She did n't know , and now he was dead . One of the policemen was a friend of Dodd 's , and Dodd got there just as the ambulance pulled away . <p> " What was she doing over here , Dodd , around people like this ? She do n't have no business around people like this . That boy pulled a knife on a man down at that Roadhouse place one night last week , and we found a gun under his front seat . What was she doing around people like this ? " <p> She could n't hear Dodd 's answer . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets ahold of it , " the policeman said . " That old woman said she wanted to talk to one , though . She said , to anyone who would listen , that Libby had something going with him and was mad that he was trying to break it off . " " Libby , we 're going to have to ask you some questions . " The policeman stood over her where she sat on an upturned bucket . " Dodd is going to drive you to the police station . He 's already sent for Ben Bradford to meet us . " <p> There was a long string of ants crawling with purpose up and down the gravel at the policeman 's feet . One strayed from the caravan and was searching frantically over the heavy black toe of his shoe , and Libby could hear a mosquito at her right ear . She wondered how they could tell you had blood even before they bit you . <p> " Ben Bradford is a lawyer . " Libby said it aloud , slowly , then looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's get in the car . " Dodd put his hand out to her , and she stood . <p> " It 's all my fault . I was trying to run away . " <p> " Hush , honey , wait till we talk to Ben . " Dodd looked pale , and his sports coat was wrinkled . <p> Libby stared out the window while Dodd backed down the driveway . In the shade of the blue tarpaulin one of the dogs lay sleeping , paying no more attention to the police cars and the people than it did to the mostly empty produce boxes . The coffee can lay on its side in the dirt . <p> " I was going to help them , but I was n't good enough . Jesus said to love them just like I love myself , and I could n't do it . " <p> " Libby , honey , just : hush until we get there . That 's what . Ben said to do . He 'll get us out of this . " <p> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was setting , and there was a muggy yellow haze coming across the fields from the creek . Libby knew that riding on that haze were thousands of mosquitoes , a million gnats . The bats were coming out , too , and purple martins swept back and forth like they were stitching together a giant awning . The sun sent out a last jagged shard from behind the trees along the creek bank , blinding her , and then was gone . <p> As they passed the house , the policemen were getting into their cars , writing in notebooks , squatting on the ground . A truck had parked on the shoulder of the road , and two men , both in green farm caps , were leaning against the tailgate , staring . Out in the garden , at the far end of a row , a bent figure straightened and watched them pass ; then the old man leaned over and picked another tomato , just like nothing had happened . <p>                @ @ @ @ @
