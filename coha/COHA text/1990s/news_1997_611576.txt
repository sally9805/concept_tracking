<p> Lloyd J. Griffiths had heard of George Mason University , but when he was asked this year if he 'd be interested in applying to be its dean of engineering , he was n't too excited about the prospect . <p> " It is not in the top 25 engineering schools . In fact , I do n't know where it is ranked , " Griffiths said . <p> But where is the 55-year-old Stanford-educated electrical engineering scholar now planning on spending the next decade ? At GMU , along with a half-dozen other new top administrators who say that after a close look , they 're convinced that the still-young but maturing institution is ready for a breakthrough . <p> " It is time for the school to take a leap into adulthood , " said GMU President Alan G. Merten , who left Cornell University a year ago to come to the Fairfax County-based school . " We can be the first truly great suburban university . " <p> It 's a lofty goal for a 25-year-old school that 's generally ranked in the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated from the University of Virginia in 1972 to become an independent institution , GMU has been preoccupied with expansion , opening a slew of special institutes and academic programs , some of which are considered redundant today . <p> It also has invested its resources in attracting big names to the faculty  --  including Nobel Prize-winning economist James M. Buchanan and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Roger Wilkins  --  which raised the university 's stature but limited the money it could spend for entry-level professors . <p> Merten says it is time to concentrate more on academic quality and less on growth  --  particularly in a few , carefully selected programs that he believes can earn the university a national reputation . <p> The chosen programs would play off George Mason 's location in high-technology Northern Virginia and its proximity to Washington . They include biological sciences , public policy and the School of Information Technology and Engineering , which will be headed by Griffiths . <p> " It is a high-risk job , " said Griffiths , former chairman of the University of Colorado 's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can create a national model of just how a college of engineering should work . " <p> Business leaders in the region strongly support those efforts , saying the lack of an outstanding university in Northern Virginia handicaps its bid to become one of the nation 's top centers for information technology . <p> " What separates a world-class region from the ones that are n't is the strength of the university , " said Edward H. Bersoff , president and chief executive of Fairfax-based high-tech firm BTG Inc . " We have a good university , but it needs to get a lot better . " <p> Stanley Ikenberry , president of the American Council on Education , an association of 1,600 colleges and universities , said GMU was being sensible to focus on economically vibrant fields such as information technology and the biosciences . But , he warned , " it is not as simple as holding a press conference . . . . It is a very tough , long-term game . " <p> Merten 's test begins in earnest this week as students filter back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the helm . After a year , he has his management team in place : a new provost ; two new vice presidents ; and five new deans , to oversee schools of law , arts and sciences , education , management and engineering . <p> And yesterday , he marked the opening of the first building at GMU 's long-planned $ 53.5 million Prince William campus , next to the IBM/Toshiba computer chip factory . <p> Merten 's impact on campus to date is hard for most students to pinpoint , although they say he has been quite visible , eating at the cafeteria , attending student events and greeting freshmen last week as they moved into dorms . <p> " He is committed to make things better , " said Jerome Jackson , 20 , a senior who is majoring in government and politics and who is vice president of student government . " But he wants to get everyone involved in that process . " <p> No one questions that GMU has made a great deal of progress in its short history . <p> The school opened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it split from the University of Virginia in 1972 , it had 4,166 students . Today , with about 25,000 students , it has the second-highest enrollment of any four-year public university in Virginia , behind Virginia Tech . It offers 55 undergraduate degrees , from biology to finance , and 54 graduate degrees . It has a law school . Its most-respected programs include its creative-writing master 's degree , the Center for Public Policy Studies and its Department of Economics , which has been popular among conservatives for its free-market leanings . <p> Much of the credit for the school 's dramatic growth during the 1980s and early 1990s is given to George W. Johnson , who stepped down as president last year after 18 years . But from the day he arrived , Merten  --  a computer scientist by training who served as the dean of Cornell 's graduate school of management  --  has made it clear that his goals are different from Johnson 's . <p> " When you are in the early phases of an institution , entrepreneurism and innovation are rewarded . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we are now at the point of saying is , ' We ca n't do everything . ' We have to create something that is more sustainable . " <p> Merten also said GMU will seek to bolster its faculty in general , rather than aiming for a few stars . " We now will be spending time bringing in the best and the brightest at the assistant professor level , funding them properly and bringing them through the ranks , " he said . <p> Perhaps most fundamentally , Merten said , GMU must improve the overall quality of its student body . <p> Of entering freshmen at GMU , 60 percent have Scholastic Assessment Test scores higher than 1,000 , compared with 97 percent at the University of Virginia , according to Peterson 's Guides Inc , a higher-education information company . <p> According to 1995 statistics , the most recent available from the state , GMU admits about 81 percent of freshman and transfer applicants , and only 51 percent of its students graduate within seven years , factors that have drawn fire from some members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia accepts 42 percent , Virginia Tech , 76 percent . The state 's average seven-year graduation rate is 61 percent ) . <p> " How much money are we going to keep plowing into people who do n't graduate ? " asked board member M. Constance Bedell . " We have just been letting too many people in . " <p> Merten 's effort to change GMU is focusing particularly on the sciences . GMU draws about $ 28 million a year in research funds from the government and other sources , mostly for science . That is five times what it collected a decade ago but still a trickle compared with the $ 100 million each that flows to Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia . <p> The relatively modest funds available at GMU make it harder to attract and keep top graduate students and faculty members . With the growth in high-technology firms in Northern Virginia , links between businesses and the school could provide more research opportunities , but so far the number of cooperative ventures has been small . <p> Part of the reason is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding ways to use technology that is created elsewhere , said Christopher T. Hill , who was appointed GMU 's new vice provost for research six weeks ago . <p> " But there 's another level up , where you generate the good ideas that create the level of business opportunities , " Hill said . " We 're just on the verge of moving into that role . " <p> Merten said he wo n't try to transform GMU into a broad-based research institution like Johns Hopkins University or the University of Michigan . But by specializing in areas that coincide with the needs of the area 's growing technology firms , he says , the university can quickly build a reputation as an important research center and play a bigger role in the local economy . That is where Griffiths comes in , as well as the Institute for Bioscience , Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at the new Prince William campus . <p> GMU 's engineering program is not even ranked by the the National Research Council in Washington , in part because the school 's doctoral program offers interdisciplinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering or computer science . The University of Maryland at College Park , by comparison , is ranked 17th out of 274 universities in electrical engineering and 16th in computer science . <p> As one way to attack the problems of reputation and funding , Griffiths plans to start a board of local industry advisers who will help fine-tune the curriculum and make donations of equipment , technical support or money . The advisers also may solicit research work for professors and graduate students . <p> Clark Tibbetts , who took over as director of GMU 's Prince William Bioscience Institute in March , plans to work with the American Type Culture Collection . The biotechnology firm that is moving from Montgomery County to InnovationPrince William , the academic and business area being developed around the new GMU campus . Tibbetts , a former Vanderbilt University microbiology professor , has been given a budget to hire 10 full-time professors . <p> Research grants will pay for some of those efforts , but the university also will be looking elsewhere . It is putting pressure on the state to adjust its appropriation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compared with $ 5,665 for the University of Virginia and $ 5,005 for Virginia Tech . <p> Ultimately , the goal is to enhance the university 's reputation and thus attract more money from alumni and foundations to build the university 's endowment , which today is about $ 25 million , compared with the nearly $ 1 billion endowment at the University of Virginia . <p> There could be pitfalls in the master plan . The pursuit of private funding can be a delicate process . For example , Georgetown University was stuck with a large bill in the early 1990s after an Italian pharmaceutical company backed out of its plan to finance a neuroscience laboratory . <p> And Michael Mullen , interim director of the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia , emphasizes that GMU must not lose sight of its obligation to serve Northern Virginia undergraduates . " It is fine to talk about quality , but you still have to sensitive to the demands in Virginia for access , especially to undergraduate education , " he said . <p> Merten says he realizes that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a look at what 's happening all around GMU 's campuses , in some of the nation 's most affluent communities , fueled by a booming high-tech economy and the proximity of the nation 's capital . <p> " To do what has to be done and be out in the middle of nowhere would be impossible , " Merten said . " But to do what we can do , because of where we are , makes it all quite possible . "
