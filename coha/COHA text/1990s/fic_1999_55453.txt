ContentsThe Weirs False Cyrano Scuzzy and Jay Leno Hippies ( The ' 60s Challenged ) Flip Forward # The Nephew <p> JAMES HAS ONE NEPHEW , Mark James . He is eight . James 's brother , Trevor , married a Parisian . Every summer before her death they vacationed in Cahors , where Joelle 's parents have a large stone house in a field of cherry trees . We joined them there twice . Maman is a woman who  --  as James says  --  keeps her own counsel . Papa has a mistress in Nice . For years , Maman has protested her situation by deliberately leaving in a certain number of cherry pits when she makes jam . Papa , who is still intoxicated with love for Maman , sprays her cologne on the surface of his bathwater . More often than not , they have a merry time , in spite of Papa 's mistress and Maman 's reluctance to effuse . Ou sont les relatives d'antan ? We have not seen them for years , I tell Mark James . <p> Since M. J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fond of him  --  to say nothing of our obvious sympathy because of the boy 's bad luck : his mother dying when he was five ; his father subsequently living with a nurse who had bipolar disorder , who was fine when she was on lithium and frightening when she became convinced her only problems stemmed from her medication 's side effects and stopped taking it ; M. J. 's dog , the recent victim of a fatal asthma attack ( just when he 'd treed the cat ; Mark James was running for his camera to capture this moment on film when the dog began to wheeze and shake . The dog was dead in minutes , though the cat stayed in the tree for two days ) . So M. J. is spending the summer with us here in Maine . <p> Although James is generally a kind man , I do n't think anything I 've mentioned really accounts for why he 's so attached to his nephew . I think it has to do with seeing himself so clearly reflected in the boy . Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James 's extreme myopia , Trevor 's recklessness disguised as an enthusiasm for acting on hunches . " I 'll bet this navigation chart was made long before the harbor was dredged , " Trevor will say . Or , " Any speckled mushroom is edible , right ? " He claims arcane knowledge to support his theories . In order to substantiate his points , he alludes to obscure journals everyone knows he does n't subscribe to . He laughs loudly at his own audacity when he 's caught lying . For reasons I do not want to hear about , Trevor is now forbidden by court order to go within twenty feet of the nurse . He says she tried to kill him . She apparently sees it differently . What is not disputed is a knife with a twelve-inch blade . I am not kidding when I say I do not want to hear about it . <p> The names of those not yet named : Shanda ( the nurse ) ; Maureen ( Trevor 's new girlfriend ) . I am Karen . Karen is pining for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her big screened porch in Maine , drawing pictures with Mark James of la famille Francais and other family members . We make a game of this : a piece of paper is folded in three ; I draw the torso of some animal , fold the page and hand it to Mark James ; he draws legs and feet in silly shoes and does n't let me see what he 's done ; then , together , we flip to the final section and decide which family member we 'll work on . Simultaneously  --  or at least as simultaneously as possible , without obliterating what the other is doing with his or her crayon  --  we collaborate on a face . This afternoon we have yet again done James : penguin torso ; hairy legs in red high heels ; unruly brown hair accurately drawn the way he 's been wearing it this summer , pulled back in a ponytail ; his narrow lips quite well rendered by Mark James ; my attempt at his deep-set eyes making him look rather evil . It is hilariously , recognizably James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve years  --  the penguin torso surprisingly suggestive of his newly acquired paunch , the footwear something he might have rummaged for and found on the bottom of my closet years ago . The sort of shoes I wore with some regularity when we lived in Boston and went to fashionable restaurants , now replaced by running shoes , Top-Siders , and sensible hiking shoes . When we stop laughing , Mark James tacks our drawing to the porch rail , where it flaps in the breeze with a dino-bodied , ballet-slippered rendition of me ( Mark James going heavy on the eyeliner ) and M. J. 's self-announced triumph of placing a good likeness of his art instructor 's face atop the torso of a coiling cobra , which I 've finished with splayed feet plunged into my best attempt at Doc Martens . " It 's him ! It looks just like Scuzzy ! " he squeals with delight . The instructor is named Sculley  --  nicknamed , predictably , Scuzzy . Scuzzy , I see , wears hip wraparounds and a visor ( which Mark James suggested I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make something appear to protrude ) , with longish hair straggling to his shoulders . Though M. J. only goes to art class once a week , Scuzzy seems to have captured his imagination . The man has already been tacked up , with the body of a porcupine that narrows into stubby duck legs with webbed feet . Next to that is the UPS man as a panther on stilts . <p> The Weirs Early evening , later than expected , James returns from Tufts . He says the air conditioner in his office was broken , so he sat all day conferring with students in Burger King . He takes a crumpled note out of his back pocket , unfolds it , drops it on the table , and looks at it the way an anthropologist might look at what he strongly suspected was petrified shit . GODDAMN A.C. NOT WORKING , the note says . MEET FOR COFFEE @ BURGER KING . There follows a simple map illustrating how to walk to Burger King . Along the side of the page , in red ink , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of our lord God in vain ! ! ! <p> " I 'm not teaching summer school next year , " James says . " I do n't care if I have to go into debt . I do n't care what senior faculty member has a coronary occlusion the day his class begins . One more summer of commuting and my heart is going to give out , too . " He takes a Rolling Rock out of the refrigerator , flips off the cap with the bronze bathing-beauty bottle opener ( her upraised hands joined by what is apparently a twisted bronze bikini top ; she is modestly wearing the bottom ) . " Where 's M. J. ? " he asks . <p> " Paddleball on the beach with the Weirs , " I say . <p> " Aw , hell , " he says . " You take him to t'ai chi , we enroll him in art class , we cave in and buy him an expensive camera , I offer to send a plane ticket to his best friend but the kid 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he flies alone , so much for that  --  why is it that he 's got approximately five thousand things to build , paint , read , and construct , to say nothing of his hundred-dollar rollerblades that he can use to his heart 's delight on this dead-end street , and all he wants to do is hang out with those self-righteous conservative Republicans and their numbskull son and their big fat tumorous dog ? " <p> " Tumorous ? " <p> " Tumors , " James says . " The dog 's got tumors . The dog 's dying anyway , so the vet does n't want to remove them . This is the sort of crap I have to listen to when I go out to mow the lawn . " <p> " Why do n't you like Danny Weir ? " I ask , sitting on a kitchen stool . <p> " Danny Weir calls his mother ' Mama , ' and last summer he crucified a groundhog . " <p> " The groundhog was dead , in the middle of the street . He 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead groundhog in the garden , the other groundhogs will believe you mean business . " <p> " Karen . He nailed together two dowels in the shape of a cross . I 'm surprised he did n't dress it up in a loincloth . " <p> " Well , " I say lamely , " it came down the same day . " <p> " And was n't that some sight ? " he says , drinking his beer . " The kid taking off as fast as he could on his bike , the father running down the street with the crucified groundhog over his head like he was auditioning for Chariots of Fire . " <p> " OK , " I say . " You dislike the whole family . " <p> " And what about Trevor ? " James says in a complete nonsequitur . " I suppose he still has n't called , or even bothered to send a postcard to his son ? " <p> At the beginning of summer , Trevor and his new girlfriend  --  I am thankful James does not yet know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once  --  in-laws/always  --  in-laws , Maman and Papa , and to borrow one of Papa 's Mercedes to drive through the Alps . A honeymoon before the honeymoon , Trevor called it . More irresponsible idiocy before a continued lifetime of idiocy , James said to me . He does not approve of Trevor quitting his job  --  James does not know that Trevor was demoted twice in one year  --  and as far as I know , James is not yet aware of the existence of Maureen 's three-year-old daughter , who is spending the summer in Yellow Springs , Ohio , with her father . People  --  having taken their cue from George Burns out on the balcony , announcing what Gracie does n't know  --  are always taking me aside and telling me the complexities of their lives ; their darkest thoughts ; their desperate plans . Why people are so intimidated by James , I ca n't imagine . The bottom line is that after the bluster , he puts up with more than most people . For the last three summers , he has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bought the child almost everything he desired . Though he claims to hate the neighbors , he drove Andy Weir to the Portland airport when his car would n't start and offered to pick him up two days later if the mechanic could n't fix it . And though he claims to be at wit 's end in his attempts to get me to marry him , he says behind my back that he admires my strength of character and feels I am " judicious . " Other things that Gracie does n't know : When Janice Weir gets her Ph.D. , she is leaving Andy for her dissertation advisor , a professor at U Mass  --  this man has recently left his wife , who is confined to a wheelchair with MS ; at Christmas , following a call from her husband 's lover , Maman plunged the tip of a potato peeler into Papa 's forearm ; a leachate plume that has seeped deep , deep into the earth from the sand aquifer of the now-closed town dump is zigzagging in the direction of our well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't know that sometimes it seems to me he wanders in a sort of cartoon world he assumes to be a realist painting . Now and then I feel like throwing my arms around him and blurting : " No ! There 's no sense in driving Weir to the airport , because his world will come apart whether he catches a plane or not ! " Or : " Do n't waste your time sending a note to Shanda saying you hope she 'll still consider us her friends : not every manic-depressive steals morphine from the hospital and sells it at a disco called Monsoon . " <p> " You seem lost in thought , " James says , inspecting leftovers in the refrigerator . <p> The temptation is too great . I say : " You know , I 've been keeping something from you . " <p> " What ? " he says . His eyes constrict into the narrowed , shadowed lines of the drawing Mark James and I made earlier in the day . By complaining , James makes a sort of preemptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fall apart , turn ugly , he will have shouted fire . He will not have been an unaware , complacent person . " What ? " he says again . <p> " I 've been watching the reruns of Burns and Allen , " I hear myself saying . " I quit my job to write the great American novel , and every afternoon I watch a show I would n't have watched as a kid . Sometimes I get up after you 've gone to sleep , too , and watch reruns of absolutely anything , even the Tonto show . " <p> He looks relieved . " It 's wonderful you 're writing a novel , " he says . " You do n't have to account for how you use your time . The only important thing is that the work gets done . If you 'd stayed in a job you hated , you 'd have spent your life wondering if you could have made it . You 've done exactly the right thing . " He removes the foil from a bowl that contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quivering piece of tofu . He plucks out the radish without comment and tosses it in the trash . He sniffs the tofu . He shakes a bottle of vinaigrette , removes the cap , and pours a thin stream over the avocado . He sits on the kitchen stool , picks up a fork , and begins to eat , uncomplainingly . I wonder , myself , why after twelve years I have not married this man . I think it has to do with equilibrium : his , not mine . I sense that through no will of my own , I have begun to live vicariously ; I have become a repository of information from other people about the difficulty  --  if not outright futility  --  of romance . These sad announcements seem both discouraging and , increasingly , to act as a sedative . In accumulating more than I should hold , I 've become groggy , the way people transfused with too much blood become sleepy . I 'm now accustomed to observing one thing , with my inner eye on another . This has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelations would only burden James , bring forth his cynical thoughts perking just under the surface  --  disturb his simple eating of a peach , in effect . To say nothing of day-old tofu . <p> " You know , " I say , feeling a little sorry for myself , " I admire the way you speak so straightforwardly . I do n't ever have to wonder what you really think . The only thing I wonder is whether you always know what you think . Sometimes it seems like you rush in with a judgment you have n't really made , just to brush things aside . " <p> " Everybody does that , " he says . <p> " Everybody does that ? " <p> " Sure . It 's the basis of how people operate . Consider racism . Think how difficult it would be not to generalize about people in terms of race and gender . Think how complicated things would be if you did n't automatically assume women are more in touch with their feelings , for example . " <p> " You assume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the cliche : women know how they feel ; men know where they are . " He puts the bowl in the sink . " I can say that to you , because you wo n't take it wrong . It 's not what I 'd say in front of an audience with a microphone in front of my face . " <p> There : another confidence . Still , he probably has it right . All the while we were talking , I was holding in the back of my mind the hope that Mark James was having a good time at the beach , that he would n't , yet again , lose at paddleball with the Weirs ' strange son , whom I try so hard to sympathize with : his mother about to run off ; his father cuckolded ; the family collapsing . Of course James was thinking : The beach . One-and-a-half miles down Route 1 , to the west . <p> False Cyrano McCale , the dissertation advisor , comes in the middle of the night to sing his drunken Cyrano serenade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intending harm to the idiot who has awakened him , letting out the tumorous dog to growl at and , he hopes , to bite the drunken scum who has trespassed on his property and disturbed his peaceful sleep . <p> Janice Weir knows who it is , sees her lover behind the disguise of his shirt wound like a turban on his head , sees with X-ray vision through the Wayfarers sliding down his nose his dreamy bedroom eyes . Suddenly she ca n't stand it another second , rushes out behind the dog to jump into her drunken lover 's arms , intending just to leave them behind , these mistakes of her past , her husband and the son that was the thing he wanted most in life  --  except that she trips on the garden hose , still spread across the lawn after Danny Weir 's gratifying evening of washing away the anthills that once rose in perfect pyramids between the gaps in the flagstone walkway . In our bedroom , James has struggled up and thrown open the sash like St. Nick in July , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick to death of lunatics who pull pranks at night in what used to be a quiet neighborhood before the subdivision was built at the base of the hill . My thoughts , though , race ahead of theirs : maybe it really is a burglar , teetering so from side to side that he seems to be auditioning for all positions in a chorus line as Janice 's unlucky , non-Cinderella foot catches under the hose and she topples forward . As the newspaper would soon tell us , she broke her ankle and two ribs , dislocated her shoulder , chipped one front tooth and loosened another . Worse yet , her first words , once she was gathered up and sprawled in Weir 's trembling arms , were that she hated her life , and in particular Weir . They both thought she was delirious . The dissertation advisor sobered up almost instantly , which was something of a miracle , though even a miracle could not save him when Weir realized she was not trying to whisper anything to anybody , but rather to kiss McCale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatched up by James , who had raced down the stairs and out the back door to be of assistance , activating the motion-detector at the side of our house , which then turned on the outside spotlight and lit the strange tableau like the final act of the bad play it was . Weir 's son was in a panic , seeing the hose , seeing his mother , seeing the wild eyes of the man he had met earlier in the summer at a picnic , and all the while James was standing there as if he were one of the wise men  --  the other two certainly were not  --  clutching his offering . <p> As I watched , there was a quick , nose-to-nose conversation between Weir and McCale . I was so transfixed it took me a few minutes to separate her low moans from Weir 's panting and McCale 's protestations , but I was still the first one to register the extent of her injuries . I ran for the telephone and called the ambulance . <p> " My God , " James said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerk . To come right to their house to get her ! " <p> " It was potentially romantic , " I said . <p> The fight outside continued . Weir 's son had turned on the hose and was blasting McCale , urged on by his father , who darted in and out of the water to shove the cowering man and scream in his face . In the distance I could hear the ambulance . James looked at me . " If you 're going to be a writer , you 'll have to come up with better lines than that , " he said . " Who would believe someone would say , ' It was potentially romantic ' ? " He sat on the side of the bed , examining his blood-flecked pajamas . " He bent my ear about her affair all the way to the airport last week , " James said . " I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again : I just do n't like those people . " <p> " What 's all the noise ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in the dark , peeking out the window and pretending not to . " Is it Shanda out there ? " he asked , in a frightened little voice . <p> " No , no , " James said , quicker on the uptake than I was . " Do n't worry about that . " He reached out to take Mark James by the hand . " Shanda 's out of the picture , you have my word . " He pulled Mark James onto the bed between us . " The Weirs are having a fight , " he whispered , dropping his arm around the boy 's shoulder and leaning close to his ear , as if  --  above the noise of the police car 's two-way radio and the sound of the idling ambulance , both of which were shot through with the shrill sound of Weir shouting profanities at the moon as a finale  --  we might embarrass ourselves by being heard discussing their situation . <p> Scuzzy and Jay Leno Scuzzy comes to dinner . This is a big deal , because Mark James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidecar that contains , I kid you not , a mongrel named Jay Leno . The dog selected its own name , Scuzzy tells us : every time Jay Leno came out to give his TV monologue , the dog went crazy , barking . Scuzzy had found it eating out of a tipped-over garbage can outside a restaurant . <p> Jay Leno comes onto the porch and sniffs around . He scares himself by nosing into a spider 's web and bothering the spider , who jumps onto a board and begins to climb , fast . Jay Leno takes three steps backward-sort of like Prince Philip , realizing he 's been moving at too fast a clip . <p> " So this is the summer art gallery , " Scuzzy says , smoothing open the humidity-curled drawings to study the faces of family and friends atop animal torsos . " Very nice , indeed , " Scuzzy says . I imagine that by tomorrow Jay Leno 's thick-coated body will have made his way into one of the sketches . Meanwhile , a proud Mark James explains who everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maman as a rhinoceros . " I look , myself : Maman 's head atop an amorphous gray body that is only to M. J. 's understanding the body of a rhinoceros . Papa as Godzilla , wearing anklets on his paper-pale legs . If only writing could reveal as much as these collaborative drawings . I began to think I should fold my typing paper into thirds . <p> " Next door , " Scuzzy says to me as Mark James runs off to get his crayons and create a drawing right in front of lucky Scuzzy 's eyes , " next door is where that professor from Massachusetts pulled up late at night .... " <p> " Right , " I say . Cars have been driving by to look . Suddenly our dead-end street has been filled with turn-arounds . The newspaper account of the fight was unusually thorough  --  probably a summer reporter trying to land a full-time job . In any case , James and I pray that soon people 's interest in The Love House will wane . It stands empty : Weir was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ambulance team . We assumed he 'd return to the house upon his release , but he never showed up . Janice and McCale were there one night , but they left almost immediately , she holding a lamp and hobbling in her ankle cast , McCale in a baseball cap instead of an improvised turban , and a cervical collar . <p> I pour Scuzzy some wine from the yard-sale decanter on the picnic table . I explain that because of heavy traffic on Fridays , James will probably not be home from Boston for another half-hour or so . Jay Leno flops down and rolls onto his back , displaying his anatomy . " Big dog , big dog , boogie-boogie , " Mark James says , running onto the porch , pointing his crayons at the dog . Jay Leno shiver-sighs and closes his eyes . Meanwhile , another car coasts to a stop in front of the Weirs ' place ; on the radio , Madonna is singing a song of many summers past . The people gawk for a while , then quickly bump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a U-turn . I cringe as a peony bush is sideswiped . " Prove your love to me , " Madonna drones . <p> Mark James sits next to me , curled over a drawing of a bulbous gray body . " Manatee , " he says , looking up . He crayons a minute more , then hands the folded paper to me . I add the quick outline of the hem of a kilt and knee-high socks with tasseled shoes before flipping to the last part of the drawing and  --  could n't I have guessed  --  am instructed , amid childish giggles , that this one is to be Scuzzy . I get his frazzled hair in a few sure strokes ; Mark James attempts the long , straight nose , and I lengthen it . Each of us reaches for a blue crayon  --  light blue and medium blue  --  to do an eye . We are a good team , and Scuzzy is impressed with how fast his face takes form . He dots on some mosquito bites with small red crayon taps under one eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considering that the crayon point is as round as a fingertip . " You ! " Mark James says , springing up and applauding . This brings Jay Leno to his feet . Scuzzy lowers the drawing in front of the dog 's face , and when Jay Leno steps back two paces , we all burst into laughter , which slightly frightens the dog , who barks loudly . <p> This sound becomes the bugle blast that announces James 's arrival : James , who has just been issued a ticket for passing on the right when he had already been having a terrible , terrible day because a mouse died inside his air conditioner and the smell had been unbearable until the maintenance man figured out what it was and pulled off the grille . Even if we think so , this is not funny , in the least , at all . <p> OK : so we have a bit taken . The Chardonnay is gone , and when James returns with another bottle , we all see it as a brilliant idea , except for Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly Mark James decides to cozy up to him and stroke his belly , because that very quickly pleases the dog , as well as involving Mark James enough so that James is able to quietly correct Scuzzy 's impression that he is our son . Scuzzy knows firsthand about complicated family situations : it turns out he was separated from his twin sister at birth . His sister had lived with his aunt in Boston , where she underwent several surgeries before her inner-ear problems and cleft palate were fixed . When he was four or five , Cousin Cynthia suddenly became his sister , around the same time his mother turned out to be his stepmother , his birth mother having moved back to Germany . <p> " Sometimes I wonder what Jay Leno would tell us if he could , " Scuzzy says . " Probably that he was a prince in another life , but that he sinned by spurning a beautiful princess and was banished from the kingdom and given the shape of a dog . He could have been looking for her the night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking for evidence , the way fans steal the garbage bags of the stars , trying to better understand the real Christie Brinkley . " <p> More wine , and even James becomes somewhat content . The sky pales to pink-white through the telephone wires ; the birds peck the dewy evening lawn for worms . <p> " I was engaged , " Scuzzy says . " I 've been trying to avoid closeness ever since she threw me over . Who can keep going through it ? I work basically three jobs , if you count my Mondays as an art teacher , and I 'm thinking about becoming a Big Brother . But I do n't know : liberal guilt gets mixed up with avoidance of personal pain . Those people next door : were they a hot couple , or what ? " <p> " Pretty boring , " James says . <p> " She was probably your friend , though , right ? " he says to me . <p> " No . I do n't know why she confided in me . " <p> " Told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I roll my eyes to James . " He thinks women know how they feel , and men know where they are , " I say . <p> Scuzzy considers this silently for a while . Then he says , " I do n't assume we 're talking latitude and longitude ? " <p> " I am sort of talking about latitude and longitude . Yes , " James says . <p> Scuzzy pours another glass of wine . " How come you would n't come to the parents ' picnic , but you invited me to dinner ? " <p> " Do n't like big groups of people , " James says . " I 'm a college professor . I hear the sound of my own voice much too much . " <p> " When I quit my job , I stopped doing things just because they were expected of me , " I say . <p> " Maybe tonight is a learning experience for me , " Scuzzy says . " Maybe I 'm like the exiled prince : maybe I need to learn a lesson , turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , you big dog , " Mark James says , gently rocking Jay Leno from side to side . The dog allows itself to become a canine metronome . <p> " They 're always listening when you think they are n't , " Scuzzy says . <p> " It was really awful over there , the night it happened , " I say . " James was in the middle of it . I just stayed kneeling in bed , not quite believing it , thinking it was a bad dream . Eventually it woke up M. J. , did n't it , M. J. ? " <p> No answer . He is listening but pretends not to be , whispering to the dog . Across the field , a few gray clouds intensify until it seems the sky has fissures . Then everything darkens , all at once . <p> " I was a high-school gym teacher , " Scuzzy says . " That was n't impressive enough for her . She liked to spend money . She had a wedding planned like she was royalty . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I say . <p> " About what you 're doing , " he says . " Live next to somebody . Have my summer evenings on the porch . I keep busy . Certain people will always like me because I 'm a character : guy who rides with his dog in the sidecar of his motorcycle . There 's more suspicion of me than I want , though , because I 'm a bachelor . Probably I 'd really be scrutinized if I happened to be a priest . But who knows : maybe my luck will change . Maybe I 'll get married , like you . Have a family . " <p> " We are n't married , " I say quietly . <p> " You are n't ? " <p> " I 'm working on her , " James says . " It 's delicate , though , because if I push too hard , she overreacts . My feeling is that when she has some success , she 'll stop thinking all the world is looking over her shoulder , judging her . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I was a management consultant , " I say . " So far , I 've wasted my life . " <p> " Wow , this is all coming at me pretty fast , " Scuzzy says . " Tell me again why it is you would n't come to the picnic but you asked me to dinner ? " <p> " We appreciate how much you 've inspired M. J. , " James says . " Also , we did n't want you to think we were snobs . " <p> " I 'm a snob , " M. J. says . <p> " He 's not , " James says . " I 've had to teach him , though , that shyness is mistaken by many people for snobbery . " <p> " I 'm not shy now that I 'm eight , " M. J. says . <p> " Also , he can swim like a real pro this summer , " I say . " In three years he 's graduated from the dead-man 's float to real power-stroking . He cuts through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ocean year-round . " <p> " So do I , " M. J. says , lying on his back next to the dog and looking at the ceiling light , which James has just turned on . It glows high above , a sixty-watt bulb in a paper lantern . I take this as my cue and go into the kitchen to wrestle a platter from the refrigerator , bits of plastic-wrapped cheese and dabs of pate in foil pouches falling in its wake . I gather them up and toss them back in the refrigerator . On the platter is a poached salmon with a mound of couscous to one side and sliced tomatoes with chopped olives on the other . James comes in to help , and together we set the picnic table with Maman 's Christmas-present linen napkins and my grandmother 's heavy silver , along with purple plastic plates and a large wood serving set that James found at the dump last fall , where someone had discarded it , fork and spoon plunged into a dying philodendron like two swords into the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resuscitated it nicely . Now it hangs suspended from a chain screwed into the porch ceiling , winding itself around an overhead beam , glowing with new green growth . <p> Hippies ( The ' 60s Challenged ) " It 's probably rude to say this , but I have n't met any ex-hippies for years , " Scuzzy says . " That 's what you two are , right ? Or is that insulting , like asking if those are really your own legs you 're walking on ? " <p> " Woodstock , " James says , raising two fingers in the peace sign . " There are two shots of me in the film . I 'm the one shaking my hand at the sky just as Hendrix starts singing . Then you see me later when they 're making the announcement about bad acid . I 'm talking to a girl with stringy blond hair , and the camera pans to the mud under our feet . That 's a longer shot than the first one . " <p> " I was born in ' 58 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . " I 'd describe myself as a nonconformist , though I ca n't claim to have really been a hippie . " <p> James turns to Scuzzy . " So , how old are you ? " <p> " Twenty-five , " Scuzzy says . " I 've never taken a nonprescription drug . I rarely even drink , though I guess I ca n't prove that tonight . Women expect me to have a tattoo and are disappointed when I do n't . Also , I do n't see the point of having my ear pierced when I do n't even wear a watch . You know what I mean : I consider watches jewelry . Like neck chains and nose studs and cuff links , too . I do n't feel manly wearing jewelry . " <p> We agree that the poached fish is a triumph , M. J. nodding in agreement as he goes into the kitchen for white bread and peanut butter . <p> " It 's been very instructive , volunteering to teach art , " Scuzzy says . " Today I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he tells you the story underneath his photos . It 's so fashionable to say that an image has to speak for itself , but Michals lays it right out : the last time the man and the woman were happy ; the thoughts of the person driving away . " <p> I reach behind me and get a picture from the porch-rail gallery . I hand it across the table : my face , with kohl-rimmed eyes and rosebud mouth atop the body of a dinosaur , whose sharp-taloned feet protrude through the front of this summer 's ubiquitous , velcro-fastened sandals . <p> Scuzzy smiles and removes a pen from his shirt pocket . I 'm unconventional even though I missed the sixties , he writes . Those days are as extinct as the dinosaurs , though at least today someone else 's child and my boyfriend love me . <p> Scuzzy 's hit on something , of course : when M. J. drew my eyes , he saw as clearly as a caricaturist my rather excessive mask ; when his teacher looked at my unwitting but strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , he easily filled in the rest of the story . <p> Which made me think , sitting on the porch across from one tipsy person who feared that in getting into the spirit of things he had gone a bit too far , scribbling with his ballpoint , and another person who soberly feared he could never get far enough with me , that there was every possibility my exterior was as easily seen through as the wineglass . Which I then lifted , empty though it was , in a silent toast to the future . Jay Leno , sleeping soundly on his side , emitted spasmodic doggy yips to accompany his internal monologue as M. J. , stroking his new friend , stilled time through the magic of his hands . <p> Flip Forward The next summer James and I would be married . M. J. , after his father 's breakdown ( more postcards of the Eiffel Tower than you would ever want to see , plus a Margaret Thatcher punching bag and the delivery , via long-distance calling and charge-card magic , of one dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was " funny " ) and his stepmother 's subsequent annulment of the marriage , would for all intents and purposes have become our son . It was only Scuzzy  --  the man who sat before me , so obviously filled with good intentions , unarticulated questions about the meaning of it all , and the intuition that on some random back porch , he had arrived home at long last  --  whose position would suddenly be in flux . Living in our attic , practicing tenor sax with a shrieking horn that could bring down the stars , and commuting to Boston to take photography courses in zone theory applied to cutting-edge darkroom techniques ( on the days he did not act as swimming coach to M. J. at the health club of the Charles Hotel ) , he would one day seem to me very young , the next day quite old and settled in his ways . The walking of the dog would fall to me . Together , Jay Leno and I would walk past the Weirs ' house , past the For Sale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades upon which the reflected tree branches could make it appear , some nights , that ghosts wrapped passionately around each other inside . Yet no one was home . The Weirs had moved on , somewhere , somehow , to new confusions and new lives , the anachronistic angel on its motorcycle with its faithful dog companion having stopped too late , and one house short . <p> <p> By Ann Beattie <p>
