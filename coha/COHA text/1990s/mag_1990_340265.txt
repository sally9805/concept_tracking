HARRY AND CATHERINE : A LOVE STORY <P> by Frederick Busch <P> Knopf ; 290 pages ; $18.95 <P> Frederick Busch 's characters are lonely , especially when they are with other people . Despite the title , love is in short supply in this tale of Catherine , her two adolescent sons , one lover and a dog living in cold upstate New York . The dog has the best relationships . <P> The love story is supposed to begin when Harry , her former lover , reappears on Catherine 's doorstep after twelve years . Harry is back because he has pined for Catherine intermittently , but also because he conveniently works for a Senator who wants to block a shopping mall that would disturb a black cemetery in Catherine 's town .

Divorced from the boys ' father , she takes up with Harry , then the parking-lot magnate , then Harry again , and her sons are understandably bewildered . When the younger one asks for some answers , she comforts him with " life is an amazing bitch . " The real truth Busch misses is that adult love is a feather compared to the attachments children make . While Catherine 's unwillingness to give reassurance to her sons when she has none to give is admirable for its honesty , Busch would have had a deeper love story if he had considered the notion of Catherine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some reassurances to give .
