<p> How did they spend August 19th , the memorable day in Moscow ? As usual - in line in the morning and doing work around the house in the afternoon . ' Were they frightened by the troops in the capital ? They were n't Nazi troops , were they ? ' Do they remember the good times ? Yes , under Stalin in the early 1950s . There was enough food , and there was order . ' What do they want for their grandchildren ? Lots of food and order .

But they miss the point . The coup did n't even come close to working , and neither does the rest of the country . The coup was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takeout in China , Cuban cigars are rationed in Cuba , and that 's all you need to know about communism . But since the coup d'etat piddled out , communism is illegal in the U.S.S.R. , or the Soviet Union , or the Union of Sovereign So-and-So Republics , or whatever they 're calling themselves , so when you order chicken Kiev in Kiev . . . Chicken is finish , ' said the large , mopey waiter , making two fists and banging his forearms together in the national signal for We 're out of it or we 're closed or anyway the hell with you . ' <p> I never did get to place an order . Is beefsteak , ' the waiter explained when he returned from the hour-long hourly break that is the customary right of all Soviet food-service employees . A plateful of something and cabbage was deposited in front of me . It was , in fact , beef , though not the steak kind . It tasted all right , but this was Monday . I would get beefsteak ' for lunch every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pork , fish and something I could n't pronounce , and I would get beefsteak . Monday 's beef was , as I said , fine . Tuesday 's was middling . Wednesday 's was n't very good . Thursday 's was pretty bad . And Friday 's was the color of gunmetal and smelled . That was when I realized that all my beefsteaks had been cut from the same large and increasingly elderly piece of meat . <p> Marina , my Intourist guide , said this was the best restaurant in Kiev . At the table next to mine , another , smaller , more dandruffy waiter was chatting up a customer 's date . The little waiter filled her wineglass , managing to dribble some of the wine on himself . Then he grabbed the skirt of the tablecloth and wiped his hands . Over by the kitchen door the restaurant 's busboy was drinking the dregs out of mineral-water bottles . In the kitchen itself three or four people were conducting a loud quarrel punctuated with thrown pans . And a total of seven restaurant employees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around among themselves for almost a half an hour before I was allowed to pay the bill , which amounted to sixteen rubles - fifty-three cents . <p> But you could n't blame communism . Communism was illegal . And communism was extraspecially double illegal in Kiev - Kiev being the free and democratic capital of the entirely and completely , you-bet independent republic of the Ukraine . On September 15th , the day I arrived , there was a huge rally downtown where thousands of citizens cheered as members of the Ukrainian Parliament officially declared the Ukraine independent . This is the fourth time they have officially declared this , ' said Marina . So I guess independence in these parts works the same way the restaurants do . Anyway , the Ukraine was independent , and the only reason it did n't have borders and money and an armycheck and a post office was that the people in charge of those things were waiting for somebody to add up their lunch checks . <p> You could tell for sure that there was no more communism in the Ukraine because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face with paint bombs . Every bronze , concrete and marble Communist had a big white paint splash across the kisser , making the Ukraine look like a country that had acquired its national heroes in a custard-pie fight . In the main square a particularly huge statue of Lenin - which , besides paint-bomb disfigurement , had killer and fascist graffitied on its base - was being torn down ( or would have been , had anyone been able to find the crane operator ) . All the avenues , plazas and thoroughfares commemorating bolshevism were getting Main Street-type monikers . And the most popular piece of apparel was a stone-washed denim shirt with a label over the breast pocket reading U.S. ARMY . <p> Private enterprise had appeared in Kiev , at least a larval stage of it . Street vendors did n't exactly hawk their wares , but they did sit behind tables and impassively offer for purchase books , flowers and clothes . Almost every neighborhood had a private market selling food - good food . There were big , fat potatoes in Coppertone skins ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand cru tint ; noble , leonine heads of cabbage ; pot cheese with curds in folds as white as tuxedo shirts ; and melons as big and fresh as diaper-commercial babies . The meat counters were impressive , too , though not someplace you 'd take K.D. Lang on a date . Massive chunks of animals were being heaved around and chopped to pieces . Tongues , brains , hooves , feet and personal , private parts decorated the cutting boards . The tile floor was sloppy with blood puddles . But the meat was good-looking if you could bear to look : pink-champagne-colored pork , beef red like valentines and crocheted with savory fat , good teeth in the sheep skulls and clear eyes staring from the future soup-stock cow heads . <p> They were fabulous markets . They 'd do any nation proud . Except for one little problem - no customers . Some people were wandering around , but it was the kind of wandering that Americans do in Porsche showrooms . Prices in the private markets were high . Meat was selling for twenty-five rubles a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average Ukrainian makes 250 rubles a month . So thirty-eight cents a pound is like going to the Safeway and getting sixteen ounces of London broil for a hundred bucks . But it was n't poverty alone that made the private markets such dysfunctional and unbustling places . Prices were n't just high , they were bizarre . For one thing , they were all the same . Each babushka 'd grandmother selling lentils was selling lentils for the same price as every other babushka 'd grandmother - no premium for quality , no discount for quantity and no haggling . <p> I asked Marina about the beef . I said : Is n't beef cheaper this time of year ? I mean , if you do n't slaughter cattle in the fall , then you have to feed them in the barn all winter , and especially in a country with a grain shortage , I 'd expect lots of people would be bringing cattle to market right now , increasing supply and driving down price . ' <p> No , ' said Marina . <p> Now pigs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised on slops , and people are going to be tossing out food scraps year-round , so the price of pork would tend to remain constant . ' <p> Meat , ' said Marina , sells for twenty-five rubles a kilo . ' <p> Beef and pork , they both sell for the same price ? ' <p> Meat , ' said Marina , sells for twenty-five rubles a kilo . ' <p> Fresh spring lamb ? ' <p> Twenty-five rubles a kilo . ' <p> Stringy old mutton ? ' <p> Twenty-five rubles a kilo . Meat , ' said Marina , sells for twenty-five rubles a kilo . ' <p> There was another way to buy food in Kiev : at the state food stores , with their long , scuffling lines at the head of which was nothing , just about nothing at all . There was bread , sometimes , which you could use as a medicine ball or a boat anchor . There were ten or a dozen five-gallon jars full of murky liquid with a few unidentifiable pickled things resting on the bottom and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sausages , when there were any to see , were a shock and a horror , looking like nothing but discarded sex toys . The produce was appalling . The potatoes resembled gray prunes , and no other vegetable was distinguishable from compost . <p> But the prices were right . The state store 's carrots - which could have passed as criminal evidence , wizened remains of a kidnap victim 's severed fingers , maybe - cost fifty kopecks . And a kopeck is three thousandths of a penny . The carrots in the private market cost six times as much . Thus the Soviet economy is undermined by a kind of reverse black market from an antimatter universe , a black market where it is legal to buy things you do n't want too cheaply . <p> Every aspect of material life in the Soviet Union works this way . If you stand in line long enough , the state provides goods and services . The services are out of service , and the goods are no good , but food , clothing , shelter and medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hilariously inexpensive . The babushkas in the private markets do n't really have to sell you anything . They 're there to make money , not a living . If you do n't buy the food , well , then . . . fist-fist , forearm-forearm . . . they 'll take it home and eat it themselves , and you can stand in line for mummified carrots . <p> Marina , eyeing a selection of lard in a broken dairy cooler at the state food store , said , The two most difficult things in the Soviet Union are getting enough food and losing weight . ' <p> <p> AN AMERICAN 'S FIRST reaction to the Soviet Union is to roll up his sleeves . There is so much to be done . Of course , that 's true in any poor country , but in the Soviet Union there is the what with which to do it . Give an American a couple of gallons of paint , some Murphy 's Oil Soap , a mop and a can of Lysol spray disinfectant and the private food markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fixed in an afternoon , just turn anybody 's grandmother loose in there with a Fannie Farmer Cookbook , a copy of Emily Post 's Etiquette and a .38 revolver . Something could even be done with the lurching , squealing , backfiring , oil-dribbling Volga sedan in which I was being driven around town . Two cans of Bondo and it 's a 1956 Studebaker President - a real collector 's item on the classic-car market . <p> Not that the Soviets are incapable of helping themselves . Marina described how her friends take local goods to Poland to sell them for hard currency ( it says something that Soviets consider the zloty a hard currency ) , then fly to Turkey because that 's the cheapest Western country ( it says more that Soviets consider Turkey a Western country ) . In Turkey they buy clothes and dry goods and bring these back and sell them for a good profit in consignment stores . But Marina was embarrassed by this . We hate to be seen trading , ' she said . It makes us feel almost like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiev the topsoil was turned up in lustrous brunet furrows and smelled so rich it seemed like you would n't need to grow food , you could just cook soup from the loam itself ( the beefsteak restaurant tried this ) . The peasant houses were big and well proportioned , made of structural clay tile with hipped roofs of tin sheeting . Doors and windows were deep-set in elaborately carved frames . On the second story of most houses was a large glassed-in porch , the Ukrainian equivalent of a Florida room - a Siberia salon perhaps . The homes all had generous yards surrounded by Tom Sawyer board fences , many with the palings painted alternately blue and yellow , the Ukrainian national colors . These quaint but substantial homes could be sold by the thousands as vacation getaways for two-income urban professional families if only the Ukraine could be made trendy . And who knows ? Fashion is an odd thing . Collective farming may replace skiing or tennis as the thing to do . Hollywood executives could start driving wheat combines to work , and Ralph Lauren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would be a great relief to the Ukrainian peasants who would then be able to move somewhere - anywhere - besides these handsome villages surrounded by the best farmland in the world . <p> Because there was nothing in those villages . There were no stores , except the state food stores , and no food in these . Out in the fields men and women were using the kinds of wooden farm implements that decorate walls in the United States . There were no roads , just mud spaces impassable for half the year . At least the highway to Kiev is well paved , ' I said to Marina . She laughed . The highway was paved because this was the highway to the dachas belonging to high officials in the Ukrainian Communist party . ( Not that they 're high officials in the Ukrainian Communist party anymore ; now they 're high officials in the National Government of the Ukraine . ) The peasants ' houses all had wells outside , with cranks and buckets and little roofs over them . I thought they were lawn ornaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells were shallow , and there were no sewers , only cesspits even shallower than the wells . If any of these had really been wishing wells , what the peasants would have wished for was clean water . And it was all so easily put right - one day with a drilling rig and a pickup-truckful of cheap pipe would do it . Even Soweto has indoor plumbing . A septic tank is nothing but a concrete box , and to judge by Soviet architecture , the locals were plenty capable of making one . The Dnepr River was only a few miles away . A couple cartloads of riverbed gravel , some shovel work and a tractor or an ox or the kids ' pulling a log drag would make for weatherproof roads . <p> We need some economist to give us a plan , ' said Marina . <p> You had that already , ' I said . <p> <p> WE DROVE ABOUT fifty miles north on the dacha highway to the edge of the closed zone around Chernobyl . The zone has a radius of just eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dairy cows were still grazing , and people were still living - sick , maybe , but still living . The irradiated ground did not glow or make drive-in-movie noises . No giant mutant predators or revivified lizard monsters stalked across it . I would have felt better if I 'd seen one . A cicada the size of Space Mountain would have gotten somebody 's attention , even in the Soviet Union . But radiation does n't have very immediate or clearly visible effects , so nothing very immediate or clearly visible was being done about it . The border of the closed zone was one strand of barbed wire . There was a checkpoint on the road with a sign reading , CITIZEN , ATTENTION . YOU ENTER A PLACE OF SPECIAL REGIME . Another sign warned visitors not to hunt , fish , camp , pick mushrooms or drink water . <p> Three atomic reactors ( one of which has since caught fire ) were still operating at Chernobyl . A busload of men and women coming home from work stopped on the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given a cursory check with a Geiger counter . The workers passed in one door of a little shed and out another faster than passengers go through an airport metal detector . They looked depressed , but then again , everybody looks depressed in the Soviet Union . <p> Do you want to interview them ? ' asked Marina . <p> I want to know why they 're still working there . ' <p> For pay , ' said Marina . And I could n't think of anything else to ask . <p> On our way back we stopped to look at a hydroelectric dam with rusty sluice gates and unkempt high-tension wires . It was immediately up-river from the city . Thirty-three feet of water loomed above downtown Kiev - a supersoaker of Damocles held in place by the same quality of materials and engineering that went into the Chernobyl reactors . <p> <p> MARINA WAS PESSIMISTIC about the dam . One day - whoosh . ' Marina was pessimistic about everything . She explained how it was now legal for Soviet citizens to buy Western goods in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard currency . We visit these stores like you would visit a museum , ' she said . ( She meant Porsche dealership . ) Nothing had happened with land reform . It 's like knocking on a door that is n't there , ' said Marina . And although all the property of the Communist party has been confiscated , it has been confiscated by the state that was created by the party . So , what , ' I said , does that mean ? ' Marina shrugged . <p> Marina 's grandfather had been a government official in the Ukraine when Stalin was in power , and like many government officials then , he 'd been sent to a prison camp . He got out only because Stalin died . Nonetheless , Marina grew up with a certain faith in the Soviet system . Then when she was in high school in the Seventies , she heard Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 's Gulag Archipelago being read on Radio Liberty broadcasts from the West . This upset me terribly , ' she said . In 1979 she was allowed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She spent the first hard currency she ever possessed on Solzhenitsyn books , which she could find only in English . She hid them carefully in her luggage because she knew if they were found , she would n't be traveling to Western Europe again . <p> Marina read those books aloud to her family . They sat around the kitchen every night with Marina translating , a Russian-English dictionary by her side for words she did n't recognize . Too many intellectuals were killed , imprisoned , ' said Marina . No one wants to be an intellectual here . In America you call somebody a fool , we call them an intellectual . ' <p> <p> THERE WAS NO SHORTAGE OF FOOLISH INTELLECTUALS in the Republic of Georgia . And they all had guns . <p> Georgia is , of course , claiming independence from the Soviet Union . The whole Soviet Union is claiming independence from the Soviet Union . And all the independent places have places claiming independence from them . Something called South Ossetia is trying to secede from Georgia . I 'll bet South Ossetia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once the second most powerful nation in the world is becoming a collection of countries with names like the Republic of Me and You and I 'm Not Sure About Me . <p> But that 's not why the intellectuals had guns in Georgia . They were n't rebelling against somebody else 's government . They were rebelling against their own . <p> Last May , Georgia held its first free elections since the Neolithic Age and elected one Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia president . Gamsakhurdia ( pronounced sort of like Gram 's accordion ' but not really ) is a distinguished-looking , hammy-acting university professor and a prominent Georgian nationalist . He helped found the local Helsinki Watch human-rights monitoring group , was convicted by the Brezhnev government of monitoring human rights and was sent to jail for it . Gamsakhurdia was quite the local hero and was elected by an eighty-seven-percent margin . <p> Once in office , however , Gamsakhurdia began acting like a butthead . He closed newspapers , arrested opposition leaders , fired everybody in the government who did n't agree with him , spent $460,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vegetables or building materials anywhere except Georgia , blocked business privatization and land reform and accused the United States of conspiring with Moscow to prevent Georgia from becoming independent . <p> So Georgians began to demonstrate . Thousands of them marched up and down Rustaveli Prospekt , Tbilisi 's Main Street . The anti-Gamsakhurdia protesters occupied their own opposition-party headquarters , but that seemed inadequate somehow , so they took over the National Congress Building and swore to stay there until . . . I 'm not sure until what . The government responded not by attacking the protesters but by calling on protesters of its own to protest in favor of itself . Gamsakhurdia went on national television and asked people from all the little towns and villages of Georgia to come to the capital to protect him . And come they did , in scores of flag-decked buses . Thousands more Georgians marched up and down Rustaveli Prospekt . Police used the village buses to build barricades around the National Government Building , down the street from the National Congress Building , and the pro-Gamsakhurdia protesters swore to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government did attack the opposition a little bit . On September 2nd , Georgian special-security forces ( which might not have been very special because up until September 2nd , Georgia had n't had any special-security forces ) shot at some demonstrators . But despite a lot of impassioned rhetoric , no one managed to die until September 22nd , when a thirty-five-year-old cardiologist set himself on fire in front of the National Opera Building , on Rustaveli between the National Congress Building and the National Government Building , leaving a note saying , If Georgia needs blood to settle the conflict , then take mine . ' Although up until then , Georgia had n't . <p> Meanwhile , Georgia 's National Guard - which is commanded by a sculptor and looks about as professional as a group of middle-aged duck hunters - split into two groups professing neutrality . One group was neutral and prepared to defend the nation against opposition lawlessness , and one group was neutral and prepared to defend the nation against government oppression . <p> The anti-Gamsakhurdia protesters and the part of the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national television station , but since this is a very bureaucratic society , they stormed the offices of the television station 's bureaucracy , leaving the government with the actual broadcast facilities . <p> If none of this makes sense , it 's because - believe me , I was there - none of this makes sense . <p> <p> GEORGIA WAS LESS PERFECTLY DEPRESSING than the Ukraine . The food was better . The weather was cute . The Caucasus Mountains were - I do n't think I 'm saying this just because I 'm Caucasian - really beautiful . Tbilisi , the capital of Georgia , squats prettily in the Kura River Valley about 160 miles inland from the Black Sea at what was once the extreme southeast corner of Hellenic civilization . Medea of Golden Fleece fame was from Georgia . After Medea got divorced by her Argonaut husband , Jason , she murdered Jason 's second wife , tore her own sons limb from limb , and ran off to Athens in a chariot pulled by dragons . I 'm told that this , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from Georgia , too . <p> Anyway , Tbilisi is sort of charming and old . There are little , crimped streets with New Orleans-style balconies , some Constantinople Jr . churches , lots of midget stucco houses with grapevines tangling their patios and only a large - rather than infinite - number of horrible Communist cement apartment houses . The city has been destroyed forty times in Georgia 's quarrelsome 1500-year history but not lately . In 1801 the last king of Georgia - named , as you might have guessed , George - turned the whole country over to Russia . If Stalin , Medea and the protesters on Rustaveli Prospekt are anything to go by , who can blame him ? <p> There were huge demonstrations the night I arrived . I was n't scheduled to meet my Intourist guide until the next morning . I do n't speak a word of Georgian and the only word of Russian I speak - tovarish , comrade ' - is a word you do n't say anymore . So I did n't have any idea who was demonstrating against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual urban elites , and I knew the progovernment people were peasants and factory workers , but everybody dresses so badly in the Soviet Union that it was impossible to tell which was which . All of them , including some members of the National Guard , were wearing those stone-washed denim shirts with U.S. ARMY on the pocket . <p> Sometimes the two sides marched around ignoring each other , and sometimes the two sides argued with each other , and sometimes I could n't tell for sure if there really were two sides . I gave up and went to my hotel , where I found the restaurant closed because - as best I understood - it was dinner time . ' <p> This hotel was just off Rustaveli , around the corner from the occupied National Congress Building ( though I did n't know that was what it was ) . I left the door to my balcony open so I could hear if whoever started fighting with whomever else . Which at three in the morning they did , but I slept through it . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sitters-in had been hastily removed from the Congress Building . My Intourist guide Nina and I drove to the TV station , where Nina went looking for people for me to interview . She produced a large , bearded fellow still blood splattered from being whacked on the head early that morning . I will never move from here ! I will defend democracy ! I want the world to know ! ' he told me , although what he wanted the world to know I had a hard time getting him to tell me . Not that I understood when he finally did . According to my notes , pro-Gamsakhurdia protesters approached the barricades at the Congress Building in a friendly manner , so that the bearded man thought they were coming for a reconciliation . But then they attacked the barricades with a crane . Three in the morning seems an odd time to be reconciled and a crane an unlikely item to bring on the errand , but never mind . Stones were thrown . ' The bearded man got hit by one the size of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into a building , but then when these attackers saw that he was covered in blood , they helped him out of the building and tried to get him into an ambulance . He was attacked by other pro-Gamsakhurdia protesters , however , but the pro-Gamsakhurdia protesters who 'd attacked him first attacked the attackers , drove them back and got him medical treatment after all . I really felt the support of those people who attacked us , ' said the bearded man . <p> Several thousand people were gathered at the TV station , most of them infected with that happy sense of purpose people have when they are standing up for a principle they have n't really been knocked down for yet . People who direct mob scenes in movies have obviously never seen a mob . Movie mobs are decided and purposeful and achieve instant internal government by means of one guy who stands on a chair and yells , Hanging 's too good for ' em . ' Then off the mob goes to lynch Sidney Poitier . Real mobs just mill around acting pointlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking into PA systems that turn all human speech into car-theft-alarm noises . Nobody knew what was going on , which made everybody talk loudly about what was happening , and it was embarrassing if you talked too loudly because then everyone in the mob would come cluster around you hoping to hear some bewilderment more illuminating than his own . <p> Nina took me to talk with the leaders of the TV-station protest . This was one of five or six political interviews that I did while I was in the Soviet Union - with Ukrainian Nationalists , Ukrainian non-Nationalists , a member of the Ukrainian Parliament , anti-Gamsakhurdian Georgians , pro-Gamsakhurdian Georgians and some people I do n't know who they were . <p> I can tell you what they all had to say , if you like - I mean if you 're having trouble getting to sleep or something . I would ask them what their group advocated , and they would say , Democracy must be defended . ' I would ask , How do you propose to do this ? ' They would say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I would ask , What are your specific proposals ? ' They would say , We must build democratic institutions . ' I would ask , By what means ? ' They would say , Building democratic institutions is necessary so that there is a structure of democracy in our society at all levels . ' And by this time I 'd be yelling , BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ? ? ! ! ' And they would say , Democracy must be defended . ' <p> The Soviets were firmly rooted in the abstract , had both their feet planted in the air . It was impossible to get them to understand that government is n't a philosophical concept , it 's a utility , a service industry - a way to get roads built and have Iraqis killed . <p> Talking politics to Soviets gave me the same dull headache that I 'd had back in college reading Anna Karenina .

There are liberals who have nightmares about the NRA , and those nightmares look like this crowd . Every kind of firearm imaginable was being waved around with brainless gusto . There were ancient shotguns and decrepit hunting rifles , rusty burp guns from World War II and broom-handle Mauser pistols that looked like they 'd been buried in the yard since the revolution . There were scatter guns and target rifles and air pistols and hundreds of AK-47s . I saw a twelve-year-old carrying one of these . He was guarding the place where the mob had parked its cars .

' <p> <p> THE PRO-GAMSAKHURDIA PROTESTERS , gathered in their own mob in front of the National Government Building , had fewer guns but seemed more dangerous - that is , more likely to beat you up instead of talk you to death . <p> The peasants and factory workers who supported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come a long way for the purpose of being angry . On close inspection they were easy enough to distinguish from the urban elites . The pro-Gamsakhurdia protesters were older , thicker limbed and fewer toothed . Their clothes were the same but smellier . They were sleeping on their buses or the street and being fed free bread and pieces of dense , salty goat cheese . A movie theater had been requisitioned so they could use the restrooms as wash stalls . <p> The Gamsakhurdia supporters looked satisfied enough with their accommodations . The lines for food and toilets were shorter than most lines in the Soviet Union . I watched one magnificent old man snoring on the neo-classical portico of the Government Building . He was dressed in a wrinkled suit with World War II campaign ribbons on the jacket pocket . He had shoulders as wide as a wing-back chair , hands like Kool-Aid pitchers , and his huge head of white hair was pillowed on a four-foot cudgel . <p> These were the same kind of poor , benighted slobs who supported Noriega in Panama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during Watergate .

In fact , by the standards of the Soviet Union , he had n't done anything worth mentioning . When , at the TV station , I 'd interviewed Nodar Natadze , leader of the anti-Gamsakhurdia opposition in the Georgian Parliament , Natadze said : There is no legal ground to demand his resignation . But there is moral ground . ' The anti-Gamsakhurdia protesters were so smart , so hip and so much like us that you just knew as soon as freedom and democratic government really were established in Georgia , they 'd be voting for Jerry Brown . <p> <p> NOT THAT THE ANTI-GAMSAKHURDIE protesters were as wimpy as Jerry Brown voters yet .

Then I tried to call the other foreign reporters in the city , but the phone in my hotel room had a large label reading : <p> YOU ARE BEING SERVED BY KVAZY-ELECTRONIC TELEPHONE STATION KVANT .
