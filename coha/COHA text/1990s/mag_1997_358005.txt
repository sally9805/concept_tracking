Once upon a time , there was a little girl who learned she had been expected to be a little boy . So intent were her parents on a son that they failed to prepare for the possibility of her appearance , and she had to wait till the week after her birth to receive her full name : Diana Frances Spencer . Two older sisters ( and the brother who eventually arrived ) would have royal godparents , but her father and mother chose commoners to swear their faith for her at the baptismal font . <P> Her first memory was of plastic , a warm synthetic smell touched off by sunlight on her stroller . She would also remember visits to the churchyard grave of the child her parents conceived just before her , a boy who had lived barely 10 hours . If he had survived , she often wondered , would she have existed ? Or would her mother , having produced a male heir , have left her husband for another man earlier than she did , before Diana could be born ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would marry only once , and only for love , and never , ever divorce . <P> And then , once upon a time again , the same little girl grew up and fell in love and married a prince . She seemed so happy for such a splendid moment that the whole world paused to marvel at and rejoice with her , falling in love with Diana in love . But she quickly learned that the dynasty she had joined was dysfunctional and synthetic , that although she had borne her husband an heir , she could never truly become his Queen . And when she died , suddenly , a day after the 36th anniversary of her christening , the world , still in love , stopped for a very long moment to grieve . <P> Why did so many people mourn ? Why do so many mourn her still ? Was it because when the heroine of a fairy tale perishes , something dies in us as well ? Diana shared with many people the fond if naive belief that the perfectibility of the family  --  making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humankind . Her father and mother had failed miserably at family . She did not intend to . But she stumbled into the very nightmare she sought to avoid and became the spectacular mirror for other people 's disappointments : the most splendid of cautionary tales . In the monumental ruin of Diana 's life , people saw the limits of their own aspirations . <P> Many look back in embarrassment over the tears they shed . But was it unnatural to be touched ? Gerard Manley Hopkins once gave voice to that primal emotion : <P> Nor mouth had , no nor mind , expressed What heart heard of , ghost guessed ; It is the blight man was born for ... <P> It is ourselves we mourn for . <P>  --  By Howard Chua-Eoan
