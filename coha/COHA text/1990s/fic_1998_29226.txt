Chapter 1 of Unnatural Exposure Night fell clean and cold in Dublin , and wind moaned beyond my room as if a million pipes played the air . Gusts shook old windowpanes and sounded like spirits rushing past as I rearranged pillows one more time , finally resting on my back in a snarl of Irish linen . But sleep would not touch me , and images from the day returned . I saw bodies without limbs or heads , and sat up , sweating . I switched on lamps , and the Shelburne Hotel was suddenly around me in a warm glow of rich old woods and deep red plaids . I put on a robe , my eyes lingering on the phone by my fitfully-slept- in bed . It was almost two A.M. In Richmond , Virginia , it would be five hours earlier , and Pete Marino , commander of the city police department 's homicide squad , should be up . He was probably watching TV , smoking , eating something bad for him , unless he was on the street . I dialed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were right next to it . " Trick or treat . " He was loudly on his way to being drunk . " You 're a little early , " I said , already regretting the call . " By a couple of weeks . " " Doc ? " He paused in confusion . " That you ? You back in Richmond ? " " Still in Dublin . What 's all the commotion ? " " Just some of us guys with faces so ugly we do n't need masks . So every day is Halloween . Hey ! Bubba 's bluffing , " he yelled out . " You always think everybody 's bluffing , " a voice fired back . " It 's from being a detective too long . " " What you talking about ? Marino ca n't even detect his own B.O. " Laughter in the background was loud as the drunk , derisive comments continued . " We 're playing poker , " Marino said to me . " What the hell time is it there ? " " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got some unsettling news , but it does n't sound like we should get into it now . " " No . No , hold on . Let me just move the phone . Shit . I hate the way the cord gets twisted , you know what I mean ? Goddamn it . " I could hear his heavy footsteps and a chair scraping . " Okay , Doc . So what the hell 's going on ? " " I spent most of today discussing the landfill cases with the state pathologist . Marino , I 'm increasingly suspicious that Ireland 's serial dismemberments are the work of the same individual we 're dealing with in Virginia . " He raised his voice . " You guys hold it down in there ! " I could hear him moving farther away from his pals as I rearranged the duvet around me . I reached for the last few sips of Blackbush I had carried to bed . " Dr. Foley worked the five Dublin cases , " I went on . " I 've reviewed all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fifth cervical vertebral body . Arms and legs severed through the joints , which is unusual , as I 've pointed out before . Victims are a racial mix , estimated ages between eighteen and thirty-five . All are unidentified and signed out as homicides by unspecified means . In each case , heads and limbs were never found , the remains discovered in privately owned landfills . " " Damn , if that do n't sound familiar , " he said . " There are other details . But yes , the parallels are profound . " " So maybe the squirrel 's in the U.S. now , " he said . " Guess it 's a damn good thing you went over there , after all . " He certainly had n't thought so at first . No one really had . I was the chief medical examiner of Virginia , and when the Royal College of Surgeons had invited me to give a series of lectures at Trinity 's medical school , I could not pass up an opportunity to investigate the Dublin crimes . Marino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI had assumed the value of the research would prove to be little more than statistical . Doubts were understandable . The homicides in Ireland were more than ten years old , and as was true in the Virginia cases , there was so little to go on . We did not have fingerprints , dentition , sinus configurations or witnesses for identification . We did not have biological samples from people missing to compare to the victims ' DNA . We did not know the means of death . Therefore , it was very difficult to say much about the killer , except that I believed he was experienced with a meat saw and quite possibly used one in his profession , or had at one time . " The last case in Ireland , that we know of , was a decade ago , " I was saying to Marino over the line . " In the past two years we 've had four in Virginia . " " So you 're thinking he stopped for eight years ? " he said . " Why ? He was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . He may have been killing somewhere else and the cases have n't been connected , " I replied as wind made unearthly sounds . " There 's those serial cases in South Africa , " he thickly thought out loud . " In Florence , Germany , Russia , Australia . Shit , now that you think of it , they 're friggin ' everywhere . Hey ! " He put his hand over the phone . " Smoke your own damn cigarettes ! What do you think this is ? Friggin ' welfare ! " Male voices were rowdy in the background , and someone had put on Randy Travis . " Sounds like you 're having fun , " I dryly said . " Please do n't invite me next year , either . " " Bunch of animals , " he mumbled . " Do n't ask me why I do this . Every time they drink me outa house , home . Cheat at cards . " " The M.O . in these cases is very distinctive . " My tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " So if this guy started in Dublin , maybe we 're looking for someone Irish . I think you should hurry back home . " He belched . " Sounds like we need to go to Quantico and get on this . You told Benton yet ? " Benton Wesley headed the FBI 's Child Abduction Serial Killer Unit , or CASKU , for which both Marino and I were consultants . " I have n't had a chance to tell him yet , " I replied , hesitantly . " Maybe you can give him a heads-up . I 'll get home as soon as I can . " " Tomorrow would be good . " " I 'm not finished with the lecture series here , " I said . " Ai n't a place in the world that do n't want you to lecture . You could probably do that and nothing else , " he said , and I knew he was about to dig into me . " We export our violence to other countries , " I said . " The least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 've learned from years of working these crimes . . . " " Lectures ai n't why you 're staying in the land of leprechauns , Doc , " he interrupted as a flip-top popped . " It ai n't why , and you know it . " " Merino , " I warned . " Do n't do this . " But he kept on . " Ever since Wesley 's divorce , you 've found one reason or another to skip along the Yellow Brick Road , right on out of town . And you do n't want to come home now , I can tell from the way you sound , because you do n't want to deal , take a look at your hand and take your chances . Let me tell you . Comes a time when you got to call or fold . . . " " Point taken . " I was gentle as I cut off his besotted good intentions . " Merino , do n't stay up all night . " * * * * * * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across from the Custom House and central bus station , near docks and the river Liffey . The brick building was small and old , the alleyway leading to the back barred by a heavy black gate with MORGUE painted across it in bold white letters . Climbing steps to the Georgian entrance , I rang the bell and waited in mist . It was cool this Tuesday morning , trees beginning to look like fall . I could feel my lack of sleep . My eyes burned , my head was dull , and I was unsettled by what Marino had said before I had almost hung up on him . " Hello . " The administrator cheerfully let me in . " How are we this morning , Dr. Scarpetta ? " His name was Jimmy Shaw , and he was very young and Irish , with hair as fiery as copper ivy , and eyes as blue as sky . " I 've been better , " I confessed . " Well , I was just boiling tea , " he said , shutting us inside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office . " Sounds like you could use a cup . " " That would be lovely , Jimmy , " I said . " As for the good doctor , she should be finishing up an inquest . " He glanced at his watch as we entered his cluttered small space . " She should be out in no time . " His desk was dominated by a large Coroner 's Inquiries book , black and bound in heavy leather , and he had been reading a biography of Steve McQueen and eating toast before I arrived . Momentarily , he was setting a mug of tea within my reach , not asking how I took it , for by now he knew . " A little toast with jam ? " he asked as he did every morning . " I ate at the hotel , thanks . " I gave the same reply as he sat behind his desk . " Never stops me from eating again . " He smiled , slipping on glasses . " I 'll just go over your schedule , then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one P.M. Both at the college , in the old pathology building . I should expect about seventy-five students for each , but there could be more . I do n't know . You 're awfully popular over here , Dr. Kay Scarpetta , " he cheerfully said . " Or maybe it 's just that American violence is so exotic to us . " " That 's rather much like calling a plague exotic , " I said . " Well , we ca n't help but be fascinated by what you see . " " And I guess that bothers me , " I said in a friendly but ominous way . " Do n't be too fascinated . " We were interrupted by the phone , which he snapped up with the impatience of one who answers it too often . Listening for a moment , he brusquely said , " Right , right . Well , we ca n't place an order like that just yet . I 'll have to ring you back another time . " I 've been wanting computers for years , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No bloody money when you 're the dog wagged by the Socialist tail . " " There will never be enough money . Dead men do n't vote . " " The bloody truth . So what 's the topic of the day ? " he wanted to know . " Sexual homicide , " I replied . " Specifically the role DNA can play . " " These dismemberments you 're so interested in . " He sipped tea . " Do you think they 're sexual ? I mean , would that be the motivation on the part of whoever would do this ? " His eyes were keen with interest . " It 's certainly an element , " I replied . " But how can you know that when none of the victims has ever been identified ? Could n't it just be someone who kills for sport ? Like , say , your Son of Sam , for example ? " " What the Son of Sam did had a sexual element , " I said , looking around for my pathologist friend . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid I 'm in a bit of a hurry . " Shaw glanced at his watch again . " You can check . Or I suppose she may have gone on to the morgue . We have a case coming in . A young male , suspected suicide . " " I 'll see if I can find her . " I got up . Off the hallway near the entrance was the coroner 's court , where inquests for unnatural deaths were held before a jury . This included industrial and traffic accidents , homicides and suicides , the proceedings in camera , for the press in Ireland was not allowed to print many details . I ducked inside a stark , chilly room of varnished benches and naked walls , and found several men inside , tucking paperwork into briefcases . " I 'm looking for the coroner , " I said . " She slipped out about twenty minutes ago . Believe she had a viewing , " one of them said . I left the building through the back door . Crossing a small parking lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out of it . He seemed disoriented , almost stumbling as he looked about , dazed . For an instant , he stared at me as if I held some answer , and my heart hurt for him . No business that had brought him here could possibly be kind . I watched him hurry toward the gate as Dr. Margaret Foley suddenly emerged after him , harried , her graying hair disarrayed . " My God ! " She almost ran into me . " I turn my back for a minute and he 's gone . " The man let himself out , the gate flung open wide as he fled . Foley trotted across the parking lot to shut and latch it again . When she got back to me , she was out of breath and almost tripped over a bump in the pavement . " Kay , you 're out and about early , " she said . " A relative ? " I asked . " The father . Left without identifying him , before I could even pull back the sheet . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She led me inside the small brick morgue with its white porcelain autopsy tables that probably belonged in a medical museum and old iron stove that heated nothing anymore . The air was refrigerated-chilly , modern equipment nonexistent except for electric autopsy saws . Thin gray light seeped through opaque skylights , barely illuminating the white paper sheet covering a body that a father could not bear to see . " It 's always the hardest part , " she was saying . " No one should ever have to look at anyone in here . " I followed her into a small storeroom and helped carry out boxes of new syringes , masks and gloves . " Strung himself up from the rafters in the barn , " she went on as we worked . " Was being treated for a drink problem and depression . More of the same . Unemployment , women , drugs . They hang themselves or jump off bridges . " She glanced at me as we restocked a surgical cart . " Thank God we do n't have guns . Especially since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight woman with old-fashioned thick glasses and a penchant for tweed . We had met years ago at an international forensic science conference in Vienna , when female forensic pathologists were a rare breed , especially overseas . We quickly had become friends . " Margaret , I 'm going to have to head back to the States sooner than I thought , " I said , taking a deep breath , looking about , distracted . " I did n't sleep worth a damn last night . " She lit a cigarette , scrutinizing me . " I can get you copies of whatever you want . How fast do you need them ? Photographs may take a few days , but they can be sent . " " I think there is always a sense of urgency when someone like this is on the loose , " I said . " I 'm not happy if he 's now your problem . And I 'd hoped after all these years he had bloody quit . " She irritably tapped an ash , exhaling the strong smoke of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . My shoes are already getting tight from the swelling . It 's hell getting old on these bloody hard floors . " The lounge was two squat wooden chairs in a corner , where Foley kept an ashtray on a gurney . She put her feet up on a box and indulged her vice . " I can never forget those poor people . " She started talking about her serial cases again . " When the first one came to me , I thought it was the IRA . Never seen people torn asunder like that except in bombings . " I was reminded of Mark in a way I did not want to be , and my thoughts drifted to him when he was alive and we were in love . Suddenly he was in my mind , smiling with eyes full of a mischievous light that became electric when he laughed and teased . There had been a lot of that in law school at Georgetown , fun and fights and staying up all night , our hunger for each other impossible to appease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . He was my leitmotif , here , gone , then back on the phone or at my door to break my heart and wreck my bed . I could not banish him . It still did not seem possible that a bombing in a London train station would finally bring the tempest of our relationship to an end . I did not imagine him dead . I could not envision it , for there was no last image that might grant peace . I had never seen his body , had fled from any chance , just like the old Dubliner who could not view his son . I realized Foley was saying something to me . " I 'm sorry , " she repeated , her eyes sad , for she knew my history well . " I did n't mean to bring up something painful . You seem blue enough this morning . " " You made an interesting point . " I tried to be brave . " I suspect the killer we 're looking for is rather much like a bomber . He does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no faces or names . They are nothing but symbols of his private , evil credo . " " Would it bother you terribly if I asked a question about Mark ? " she said . " Ask anything you want . " I smiled . " You will anyway . " " Have you ever gone to where it happened , visited that place where he died ? " " I do n't know where it happened , " I quickly replied . She looked at me as she smoked . " What I mean is , I do n't know where , exactly , in the train station . " I was evasive , almost stuttering . Still she said nothing , crushing the cigarette beneath her foot . " Actually , " I went on , " I do n't know that I 've been in Victoria at all , not that particular station , since he died . I do n't think I 've had reason to take a train from there . Or arrive there . Waterloo was the last one I was in , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Kay Scarpetta will not visit . " She tapped another Consulate out of the pack . " Would you like one ? " " God knows I would . But I ca n't . " She sighed . " I remember Vienna . All those men and the two of us smoking more than they did . " " Probably the reason we smoked so much was all those men , " I said . " That may be the cause , but for me , there seems to be no cure . It just goes to show that what we do is unrelated to what we know , and our feelings do n't have a brain . " She shook out a match . " I 've seen smokers ' lungs . And I 've seen my share of fatty livers . " " My lungs are better since I quit . I ca n't vouch for my liver , " I said . " I have n't given up whiskey yet . " " Do n't , for God 's sake . You 'd be no fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings can be directed , educated , so they do n't conspire against us . " " I will probably leave tomorrow . " I got back to that . " You have to go to London first to change planes . " She met my eyes . " Linger there . A day . " " Pardon ? " " It 's unfinished business , Kay . I have felt this for a long time . You need to bury Mark James . " " Margaret , what has suddenly prompted this ? " I was tripping over words again . " I know when someone is on the run . And you are , just as much as this killer is . " " Now , that 's a comforting thing to say , " I replied , and I did not want to have this conversation . But she was not going to let me escape this time . " For very different reasons and very similar reasons . He 's evil , you 're not . But neither of you wants to be caught . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just who or what is trying to catch me , in your opinion ? " My tone was light but I felt the threat of tears . " At this stage , I expect it 's Benton Wesley . " I stared off , past the gurney and its protruding pale foot tied with a tag . Light from above shifted by degrees as clouds moved over the sun , and the smell of death in tile and stone went back a hundred years . " Kay , what do you want to do ? " she asked kindly as I wiped my eyes . " He wants to marry me , " I said . * * * * * * * * * I flew home to Richmond and days became weeks with the weather getting cold . Mornings were glazed with frost and evenings I spent in front of the fire , thinking and fretting . So much was unresolved and silent , and I coped the way I always did , working my way deeper into the labyrinth of my profession until I could not find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Scarpetta ? " She called out my name , her footsteps loud and brisk along the tile floor in the autopsy suite . " In here , " I answered over running water . It was October 30 . I was in the morgue locker room , washing up with antibacterial soap . " Where have you been ? " Rose asked as she walked in . " Working on a brain . The sudden death from the other day . " She was holding my calendar and flipping pages . Her gray hair was neatly pinned back , and she was dressed in a dark red suit that seemed appropriate for her mood . Rose was deeply angry with me and had been since I 'd left for Dublin without saying good-bye . Then I forgot her birthday when I got back . I turned off the water and dried my hands . " Swelling , with widening of the gyri , narrowing of the sulci , all good for ischemic encephalopathy brought on by his profound systemic hypotension , " I cited . " I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience . " What did I do this time ? " I threw up my hands . " You were supposed to have lunch at the Skull and Bones with Jon . " " Oh , God , " I groaned as I thought of him and other medical school advisees I had so little time to see . " I reminded you this morning . You forgot him last week , too . He really needs to talk to you about his residency , about the Cleveland Clinic . " " I know , I know . " I felt awful about it as I looked at my watch . " It 's one-thirty . Maybe he can come by my office for coffee ? " " You have a deposition at two , a conference call at three about the Norfolk-Southern case . A gunshot wound lecture to the Forensic Science Academy at four , and a meeting at five with Investigator Ring from the state police . " Rose went down the list . I did not like Ring or his aggressive way of taking over cases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inserted himself into the investigation and seemed to think he knew more than the FBI . " Ring I can do without , " I said , shortly . My secretary looked at me for a long moment , water and sponges slapping in the autopsy suite next door . " I 'll cancel him and you can see Jon instead . " She eyed me over her glasses like a stern headmistress . " Then rest , and that 's an order . Tomorrow , Dr. Scarpetta . Do n't come in . Do n't you dare let me see you darken the door . " I started to protest and she cut me off . " Do n't even think of arguing , " she firmly went on . " You need a mental health day , a long weekend . I would n't say that if I did n't mean it . " She was right , and as I thought about having a day to myself , my spirits lifted . " There 's not a thing I ca n't reschedule , " she added . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touch of Indian summer and it 's supposed to be glorious , in the eighties with a big blue sky . Leaves are at their peak , poplars an almost perfect yellow . Maples look like they 're on fire . Not to mention , it 's Halloween . You can carve a pumpkin . " I got suit jacket and shoes out of my locker . " You should have been a lawyer , " I said .
