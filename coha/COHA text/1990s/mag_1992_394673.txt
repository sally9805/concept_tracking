" It seems to be gratuitously courting disaster to expose our theories to conditions in which any slight weakness is likely to become magnified without limit . But that is just the principle of testing . "  --  Sir Arthur Eddington , The Expanding Universe . On November 18 , 1989 , the Cosmic Background Explorer ( COBE ) was launched into Earth orbit . Its mission : to study the dominant form of radiation in the universe , the cosmic microwave background that is believed to be the remnant heat from the Big Bang itself . In just nine minutes of observations , COBE determined that the cosmic background radiates at a temperature of just a little over two and a half degrees above absolute zero . More importantly , it showed that the intensity of the background across the spectrum precisely matches that of a perfect emitter and absorber or radiation  --  an idealized object physicists call a " blackbody . " The COBE results were a stunning victory for the standard Big Bang model of the universe . Here was evidence that the primordial fireball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a quantum seed the universe unfolded with the grace of a tropical blossom , balanced and smooth , but with all the structural attributes of a seaside fog . For astronomers , however , the COBE results added to a growing paradox in cosmology . PARADOX FOUND The problem stems from COBE 's confirmation that the background radiation is coming at us with equal intensity everywhere we look . This demonstrates that the early universe must have been smooth  --  matter and energy were once evenly distributed . This is hardly the case today . You need only walk out into your backyard at night and explore the sky with a telescope to see that or yourself . The local universe is not smooth . Neither is the more distant universe we can see with giant telescopes . Lumps of matter exist in the visible universe  --  they 're called galaxies and galaxy clusters . Astronomers have mapped thousands of galaxies in three-dimensional space from both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and have discovered that on large scales the universe is a vast , frothy tangle of galaxy clusters interspersed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther into space and further back in time , we still find galaxies . One to two billion years after the Big Bang , astronomers see galaxies shining with the blue light of hot young stars . Even further back , shining like airport beacons from the very edge of the visible universe , astronomers still see lumps of matter  --  quasars . The COBE observations , however , show that 300,000 years after the Big Bang , matter and radiation were distributed with variations in intensity of no more than a few parts in 10,000 . Prior to that era , the universe was so hot that photons of energy were continually absorbed and reemitted by matter , preventing stable atoms from forming . No lumps of matter could survive in the turmoil of the early universe . Hence , galaxies must have condensed after this epoch , when matter and radiation went their separate ways . Thus the paradox : Galaxies form in clumps . Yet we know from COBE that the universe started out smooth and featureless . At the present time , astronomers can not explain how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there does n't appear to be enough time between the COBE era and the quasar/galaxy era for gravity to have collected matter into the complex clusters seen today . It is a problem serious enough to prompt a few researchers to suggest there is something wrong with the Big Bang theory . THE THREE PILLARS OF COSMOLOGY Despite this so-called " structure problem , " most astronomers are reluctant to abandon the Big Bang . The evidence supporting the theory , they say , is extensive and compelling enough to stand on its own . Astronomers cite three observations as the underpinnings of the Big Bang cosmology . The first was made in the 1920s , when astronomers noted that the spectral lines of most galaxies ( the lines arising from the emission or absorption of radiation by certain atoms at fixed wavelengths ) appeared shifted toward the red end of the spectrum , a shift attributed to the galaxies apparently speeding away from us . Then , in 1929 , American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that a galaxy 's recession velocity is directly proportional to its distance . Astronomers concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galaxies is steadily increasing like the space between raisins in a cinnamon roll as it rises . For the universe to be expanding , however , a propulsive force of unimaginable magnitude  --  a Big Bang  --  must have set matter on its runaway course . The second fundamental observation supporting a Big Bang is the measurement of the total abundance of light elements in the universe . This is akin to analyzing the ingredients of a cake after it 's been baked . You know that for the cake to have the consistency flavor , and structure that it has , certain substances must be present . From an analysis of samples of the cake you can derive a ratio of one ingredient to another , which can then be applied to the entire body of the cake . Cosmologically speaking , the elements present in the early universe can be sampled by looking at the most ancient components of the universe  --  the oldest stars ( usually found in globular clusters ) . The ratio of helium to hydrogen in these stars is exactly what the Big Bang theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the primordial event . Though scientists have attempted to come up with other theories to account for the light-element abundances , none has accounted for them as well as the Big Bang . Finally , we return to the cosmic background radiation , considered the most compelling argument for a Big Bang . The cosmic background temperature is 2.7 kelvins , and this radiation is uniform across the entire sky . Nowhere is the temperature higher or lower than this value . Slight variations would indicate hot spots in the background , the lumpy seedlings for the first clusters of galaxies . So far , none have been detected . This is exactly what the Big Bang model predicts . CRACKS IN THE PILLARS ? But it is here that problems arise . For despite the three observational pillars , the Big Bang theory fails to fulfill the requirement or a complete cosmology : it does not explain it all . Everything in existence . Everywhere . The Big Bang theory explains only the first few moments of the universe ; it stops short of explaining how galaxies and stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This leads to the unsettling conclusion that , though astronomers believe they know how the universe began , they do n't know how it got to its present state . Like the missing 18 minutes from the Watergate tapes , there is a narrow but crucial gap in the transcripts of the universe . Filling the gap requires a theory that links the Big Bang event to galaxy formation . One such theory is the cold dark matter model . This hypothesis assets that at least 90 percent of the early cosmos was composed of some sort of dark matter , perhaps in the form of exotic , slow moving ( thus cold ) elementary particles ( axions , gravitinos , or photinos ) . Because these particles are cold , gravity has an easier time forming matter clumps at small scales in the first billion years to so of the universe . These clumps  --  estimated to have the mass of a typical globular cluster  --  gravitationally attract more matter until galaxy-sizes masses built up . The galaxies themselves then collect into the elaborate clusters we see today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galaxy formation . Unfortunately , cold dark matter , exotic or otherwise , has yet to be detected , save indirectly by what are though to be its gravitational effects on normal matter , specifically the motions of galaxies in clusters and the rotations of spiral galaxies . Astronomers have yet to determine what form this dark matter takes . ( See " Shedding Light on Dark Matter , " February 1992 ASTRONOMY . ) Compounding the problem , even the most generous cold dark matter models can not account for the astonishing dimensions of large-scale structures that are turning up in galaxy surveys today  --  structures that span nearly a billion light-years . Is the Big Bang in trouble ? Most astronomers think not . They view the Big Bang and galaxy formation as separate events . " I do n't think anything that 's happened recently has changed the majority opinion that the Big Bang is sound , " says Ethan Vishniac of the University of Texas at Austin . " I would say the current situation is that we have no believable theory of galaxy formation . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... the cold dark matter theory has collapsed . " For some astronomers , the downfall of the cold dark matter model has made the Big Bang look guilty by association , a view many astronomers reject . " Cold dark matter is a theory about the beginning of the formation of structure , " says Princeton University cosmologist James Peebles . " The Big Bang is something quite different . The problem is that the press has conflated the two . They take the discussions about the beginnings of structure and confuse them with the beginning of the universe . " Taking issue with Vishniac , Peebles , and practically the entire astronomical community is Anthony L. Peratt , a physicist and cosmologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory . Rather than propose a better theory of galaxy formation , Peratt suggests scrapping the Big Bang altogether . " The Big Bang theorists attempt to decouple themselves from the problem of galaxy formation , " says Peratt . " But one must ask what kind of cosmology is it that can not account for the galaxies and stars we observe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the time of the Ionians to Newton . Big Bang cosmologists have struggled mightily in spite of the arguments that this is not their problem . " Peratt belongs to a group of scientists who subscribe to an alternative cosmogenesis theory called " plasma cosmology , " which argues that the laws of electromagnetism , rather than gravity , dominate and shape the universe . AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE Plasma is a state of matter that resembles a gas , except that instead of consisting of electrically neutral atoms , plasma contains charge particles  --  electrons torn from atoms in a gas , leaving a cloud of negatively charged free electrons and positively charged ions . Although affected by gravity , these charged particles can also be accelerated by electro-magnetic fields . Most of the visible mass of the universe is plasma . On Earth , the most dramatic forms are lighting and aurorae . In space , stars are gravitationally bound plasmas . On larger scales , plasmas have been detected at the galactic center and in the double lobes of radio galaxies . The large plasma structure was discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two superclusters of galaxies , indicating that the superclusters are embedded in a warm plasma . The plasma cosmological model was first proposed by Hannes Alfven , of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm , Sweden . In 1970 , Alfven was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for his work in solar magnetohydrodynamics  --  the movement of plasma in magnetic fields . In separate work , Alfven reasoned that sheets of electric current crisscross the universe . These electromagnetic fields and not gravity , plasma cosmologists suggest , are the major movers of matter of the grandest scales . Interaction with electromagnetic fields . Peratt says , enables plasmas to exhibit complex structure and motion that far exceed what 's possible with gravity alone . Plasma proponents have conducted computer simulations involving tens of millions of test particles ( used to represent galaxies ) to demonstrate that a fundamentally uniform plasma will eventually break up in cellular structures that look remarkably similar to the large-scale structures seen today . The cellular structures would , in turn , act to scatter radiation . Plasma cosmologists theorize that what we detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current scatter microwave radiation from pervasive plasmas like a dense fog scatters a car 's headlights . But what about the successful prediction of the abundance of light elements proclaimed by Big Band proponents ? " We have always questioned just how well known the abundances of light elements is cellular and filamentary , what are the abundances of the elements within and without the filaments ? " Peratt cites a recent measurement of light elements in galaxies that indicates a helium abundance lower than that allowed by the standard Big Band model . A lower assumed density of the universe would produce such a lower helium abundance constraints for the other light elements for any density . Interestingly , such low helium abundances were found by other researchers in 1988 . As for the " missing link " between the Big Bang and the first galaxies , plasma physicist claim there is no missing link because there never was a matter-forming epoch . As Peratt writes in an article in the January/February 1990 issue of The Sciences , " There is no expansion , and there need not be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bang model , the plasma universe evolves without beginning and without end : it is indefinitely ancient and has an indefinite lifetime in store . " Peratt 's plasma cosmology is n't the only alternative idea . The steady state model still has a few supporters . Steady state theorists claim that new galaxies are constantly forming to replace old galaxies at a rate determined by the expansion rate of the universe . Supporters also argue that the cosmic microwave background is actually normal radiation from stars , radiation that has been scattered by metallic " whiskers " sown throughout the interstellar medium in supernovae ejecta . But do n't confuse plasma cosmology with steady state theories , explains Peratt . Steady state invokes a perfect cosmological principle in which the universe ap-pears the same at all points at all times  --  past , present and future . In contrast , the plasma universe does evolve with time . According to Peratt , " The plasma universe model has nothing to do with the steady state model . Both the Big Band and the steady state espouse gravity as the sculptor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters of alternative cosmologies , there are few agreements except , perhaps , in their enthusiasm for refuting conventional cosmology . Each has a response to the arguments posed by Big Bang cosmologists . Mainstream astronomers counter these attacks by pointing out that alternative theories like the plasma and steady state cosmologies do n't come close to the predictive power of the Big Bang . It has withstood three-quarters of a century of scrutiny , they say . It will take more than a few stabs to topple it . " We do n't really have a complete theory of planet formation but we would n't use that to question that the Sun formed from contracting interstellar gas , " says Lennox Cowie of the University of Hawaii . Cowie has made a specialty of probing the distant universe for primeval galaxies . Recently , he and a team of astronomers completed a deep infrared imaging survey that turned up thousands of faint dwarf galaxies approximately one hundredth the size of our Galaxy lying at moderate distances . These faint galaxies are likely the most populous type of galaxy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They probably contain at least as much mass as normal galaxies . " A universe filled with dwarf galaxies may account for a great deal of the missing mass in the universe , mass predicted by the cold dark matter model . And if you have more mass , you can account for more structure . So perhaps cold dark matter is still lurking out there somewhere , waiting to be found . The Big Bang theory could also be strengthened by looking at galaxy formation in a new way . In December 1991 a team of radio astronomers at the Very Large Array in New Mexico announced the discovery of a large mass of hydrogen gas near the edge of the observable universe . According to the " top-down " theory of galaxy formation , galaxy clusters formed when giant primordial gas clouds broke apart into smaller gas clouds and not when smaller clouds came together as in the " bottom-up " scenario . A refined top-down idea may explain how large structures can form in a relatively short time span , solving the current problem . The new discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom line is that the majority of astronomers are reluctant to toss out the Big Bang theory because of an inability to explain how galaxies form . " The problem of galaxy formation is one that depends on rather poorly understood physics and also on some rather shaky assumptions , " Cowie says . " The Big Bang theory on the other hand predicts both the light element abundances and the microwave background . I think until we get a much better understanding of the history of galaxy formation it would be very presumptuous to question the underlying cosmological model . " Princeton University 's James Peebles . In fact , in a paper published in the August 29 , 1991 issue of the British journal Nature , Peebles , along with fellow Princeton cosmologist Edwin Turner , and David Schramm and Richard Kron of the University of Chicago , defend the Big Bang . They point out that plasma cosmology ca n't explain why the cosmic background radiation is so uniform over the entire sky . And that is just one of many problems they see with the alternative cosmologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have said , It 's difficult to think of a theory of galaxy formation that can be consistent with all observations . So perhaps that difficulty means that the framework within which we 're working  --  the Big Bang  --  is wrong . ' And time and again that inference has been shown to be incorrect . " By being a little more clever in the invention of theories , " Peebles says , " a person can find a way around the problems and continue to look for a way to build within the Big Bang framework . " Peratt , however , remains steadfast . " Plasma cosmologists do n't feel we are " closing in on creation .... " In fact , if our findings are anywhere near right , the universe is much bigger and older than previously imagined . " The conflict between the differing views of the universe presents classic example of an established theory undergoing a revolution . Though the Big Bang model may have endured for 75 years , history is replete with erroneous scientific beliefs that survived centuries , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( continental drift , for example ) . Is the Big Bang theory wrong ? It is certainly under attack . Scientists are probing the Achilles ' heel of this venerable cosmology in a debate sparked by what new telescopes probing to the edge of the universe have shown us . But debate is what science thrives on . Without it , we would be like a people starving to death in a land of sacred cows . Jeff Kanipe , a former associate editor of ASTRONOMY , is now the editor of Star Date magazine , published by McDonald Observatory and the University of Texas at Austin . <p>                     @x Since their electoral landslide victory in November 2002 , Islamists within Turkey 's Justice and Development Party ( Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi , AKP ) have camouflaged themselves as " democratic Islamic conservatives . " n1 The AKP claims to be the Muslim equivalent of the Christian-Democratic parties of Western Europe . Such an analogy is false , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to borrow the phrase of Trinity College professor Raymond Baker , n2 but rather a strategy for a creeping Islamization that culminates in a Shari'a ( Islamic law ) state not compatible with a secular , democratic order . The AKP does not advertise this agenda and often denies it . This did not convince the chief prosecutor of Turkey who , because of AKP efforts to Islamize Turkey , sought to ban the party and seventy-one of its leaders . While the AKP survived a ban , the majority of justices found that the AKP had worked to advance an Islamist agenda and undermine secularism. n3 Nevertheless , the AKP enjoys the backing of the United States and the European Union as well . Through its support for institutional Islamism in Turkey , the West loses its true friends : liberal Muslims . <p> L : ADVANCE OF SECULARISM The processes of secularization predate the Kemalist revolution and trace back to the Tanzimat reforms , which Ottoman sultans began in the mid-nineteenth century . However , it was the Kemalist revolution that established real secularism in Turkey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim states in which secularism is constitutionally enshrined . After establishing the republic , Mustafa Kemal Atatrk abolished the caliphate , Shari'a courts , and other aspects of the Islamic legal system and religious order . The problem remains , however , that while the state is secular in terms of its full adoption , of the Swiss legal code , such secularism does not extend to civil society , at least in terms of " open society . " ( n4 ) <p> Constitutionally , Turkey is a secular state but , in reality , both Turkish civil society and its institutions are weak . In this sense , Turkey does not meet the democratic standards prevailing in the member states of the European Union . Turkish law guarantees neither freedom of religion nor freedom of speech . In 2005 , Turkish authorities sought to prosecute prominent Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk for his remarks regarding the World War I-era deaths of Armenians. n5 The AKP has legislated a variety of reforms , but these remain more cosmetic than real. n6 Serif Mardin , a political science professor at Sabanci University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil society is a Western dream ... It does not translate into Islamic terms . " ( n7 ) <p> Still , Turkey is democratic . Despite coups in 1960 , 1971 , and 1980 , Turkey has had thirteen competitive , national elections in the past half-century and more than twenty changes of ruling party . Next to Mali and Senegal , Freedom House ranks Turkey the freest majority Muslim country. n8 But , even if it compares favorably to other majority Muslim countries , Turkey is not a fully democratic state . Its national security council , Milli Gvenlik Kurulu ( MGK ) , was long run by the military and is still dominated by the military. n9 While not the most democratic institution -- the MGK could , in practice , overrule parliament -- the organization has secured the secular character of Turkey much as Iran 's Council of Guardians intervenes to ensure that country 's Islamist character . Ironically , even as European officials applauded reforms that in August 2004 bestowed a civilian head and civilian majority upon the MGK , Turkey has become less democratic . <p> Today , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules Turkey like a one-party state . The party ignores the opposition and has abandoned efforts to reach out to any constituency beyond Anatolian Islamists . It awards state positions , for example , almost exclusively to Islamists. n10 Still , even as Ankara backslides away from democracy , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Abdullah Gill leverage the European Union accession process to create an illusion of tolerance and reform . <p> L : TURKEY 'S APPROACH TO EUROPE In a sense , the AKP 's Islamism and European outreach illustrate a paradox in the way Muslims approach Europe : Either they favor Europeanization of Islam or Islamization of Europe. n11 With reform and accommodation , Islam can be compatible with democracy , but Islamism can not . In the world of Islam , Islamism aims at reversing the process of cultural modernization . Today , acculturation and secularization are reversed into re-traditionalization , de-acculturation , and desecularization . The ongoing de-Westernization in Turkish society is clear . There have been three Islamist parties since the 1970s with a real chance of acquiring power . All three were judicially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1998 , and the Fizelet Partisi in 2001 -- for the threat they posed to secularity in Turkey. ( n12 ) <p> Each of the Islamist leaders pursued different strategies . Nemetten Erbakan who , as Refah leader , became Turkey 's first Islamist prime minister , combined Islamism with neo-Ottomanism -- an ideological revival of Ottoman glory -- and pan-Turkish outlooks . The Erdogan generation of Islamists , in contrast , presents itself in European terms , but its commitment to both Europe and democracy is instrumental . As Hudson Institute scholar Zeyno Baran explains , the AKP 's commitment to democracy rests not on philosophical agreement with its principles but rather because " democratic elections ... have proven to be the easiest and most legitimate path to power . " ( n13 ) <p> Europeanized Islam embraces the values of cultural modernity , pluralism , and secular tolerance . Secularism and religious tolerance have , in many ways , provided the basis of European cultural development . Despite its Christian roots , Europe has been secular since the Renaissance and Enlightenment . Polemics that insist that the European Union is reluctant to accept an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europeanized through " the spread of one particular culture . " n14 There is no reason why Turkish assimilation into Europe could not Europeanize Turkey just as the EU has Europeanized Spain , Greece , Poland , and in part , Romania . Turkey , after all , is contiguous with Europe and shares a common Byzantine heritage with much of southern Europe , including not only the Balkan states but also much of Greece . <p> Ottoman modernity , however , never accepted the spirit of Europe . It was based on the adoption of European instruments and technology but the rejection of European values . Such instrumental Europeanization did not stabilize the Islamic-Ottoman rule but rather contributed to its downfall . The Kemalist revolution arose from the failure of the Young Ottomans and Young Turks . Atatrk 's agenda was the Europeanization of Turkey , not only technologically but also with the adoption of cultural outlooks based on modern values and norms . The Kemalist revolution sought to give Turkey a civilizational identity defined not by religion but rather by cultural values shared with Europe : secularism , individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . The problem with Atatrk 's Europeanization of Turkey was that the process was a revolution from above , imposing innovations on society without providing the necessary cultural underpinning . By focusing on urban centers , it left the countryside barely affected . The result was a bifurcation of society : a European , urban culture in Istanbul , Ankara , and Izmir , and a rural society deeply rooted in Islamic tradition. ( n15 ) <p> The AKP , however , does not accept Europeanization . Rather , AKP leaders pursue a double strategy : They verbally dissociate their party -- and themselves -- from political Islam while simultaneously embracing Islamic identity politics and , like many Islamist parties across the globe , also engaging in anti-Christian polemics. n16 The AKP uses education as its major instrument to further Islamist identity politics , introduce reinvented Islamic values , and de-Westernize society . And while the AKP claims secular credit for pursuing Turkey 's EU membership , it defames Europe as an exclusionary " club of Christians . " n17 Since its November 2002 accession , the AKP has engaged in a " creeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through politics of cultural Islamization , especially in education and media . Erdogan has worked to expand Anatolian culture in the cities , helped by internal migration . The slums and shanty towns have become the AKP 's chief base of support . <p> L : NEEDED : ISLAM 'S EUROPEANIZATION The problem of both Turkey 's entry into the European Union and the Turkish diaspora in Europe is not Islam itself but rather how to encourage the Turkish diaspora 's Europeanization . If Turkey were to become a secular , European-style democracy , it would face no obstacles to European Union accession , nor would such a strong boundary exist between Turkey and Europe if Turkey 's religion were a more civil Islam. ( n19 ) <p> What Turkey needs is not simply a laundry list of civil reforms but Europeanization of Islam . There is nothing European about the ghettos of Turkish migrants living in Islamic enclaves in Berlin suburbs such Neukln and Kreuzberg . These " Muslim enclaves "  - -  including the Turkish ones -- are " in the West , but not of it . " n20 The AKP encourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erdogan labeled assimilation of Turks a " crime against humanity . " n21 The Turkish diaspora in Europe remains antagonistic to their new home . The two major Turkish mosques in Germany -- in Pforzheim and Bremen -- are named Fatih ( conqueror ) after Ottoman Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror who , in 1453 , captured the Byzantine capital of Constantinople , modern day Istanbul . <p> Most Turks in Germany are not integrated into civil society . If Turkey , as the AKP sees it , enters the European Union , it would resemble more the Kreuzberg and Neukln enclaves than the European parts of Istanbul or Ankara . While Erdogan says his decision to guide Turkey toward Europe is firm , declaring , for example , that " Turkey has no other alternative than the full membership of the EU , " n22 it is less certain whether Europe could absorb a country ruled by Islamists . <p> The question of whether Turks can or will adopt a Europeanized Islam is crucial because demography and migration suggest that Europe will be dealing with Turkey for years to come . Turkish migration westward is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a larger pattern that began almost a millennium ago. n23 Many Turks joined Ottoman incursions into southeast Europe for opportunity and adventure. n24 Turkey 's European Union accession would lead to a similar movement of population . The European Union 's living standard and generous welfare system will attract Turkey 's rural population , which suffers from an unemployment rate between 20 and 30 percent , and where many do not receive welfare benefits. n25 Indeed , some Turkish politicians have suggested that this migration should make Turkey more attractive to Europe arguing that Turkey can offer Europe , with its aging and declining populations , a young Turkish population . There is something to this . Turkish population figures have doubled since 1970 while Western European states have a shrinking population due to low birth rates and an aging population. n26 No doubt , migration would be an advantage for Europe , as much as it has been for the United States , provided that Europe , like the United States , assimilates its immigrants . <p> Given the AKP 's instrumental approach to EU accession , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accession , European diplomats still push the Turks to undermine the three pillars of the secular republic -- the military , judiciary , and educational system -- purportedly to make Turkey fit into the European Union . While European officials couch their prescribed reforms in the language of transformational diplomacy and democracy promotions , they ignore that Islamists only accept democracy as the rule of the majority , not as a culture of pluralism . At the World Economic Forum in Davos in 1999 , the late prime minister Blent Ecevet responded to European criticism of the imbalance of power between the parliament and the MGK by explaining , " In your countries , the political culture of secularity is well established , and therefore , there is no need for a guardian to protect it . In my country , Turkey , secularism still lacks firm foundations and can always be threatened , therefore the need to protect it . " ( n27 ) <p> The Turkish writer Murat akir described the Islamists as " pseudo-democrats , " who use democracy as a cover for the promotion of Islamization whether in Turkey itself or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ankara does not contribute to Europeanizing the Turkish Muslim diaspora . Mosques , built and administered by the Turkish state through the Diyanet Isleri Baskanligi ( directorate of religious affairs ) , are not European even if they are moderate in comparison to the more militant Milli Grs mosques. n29 The difference between the Diyanet and Milli Grs mosques , however , has eroded since AKP accession led to its control of the Diyanet . <p> The secular commitment to democracy and to its values does not register in the Islamist model of an Islamic state ( din -- devlet ) , which the AKP 's actions show it accepts . Why then have Western policies toward Turkey not changed under AKP rule ? Part of the problem is that Europe does not have a clear awareness of its civilizational identity . In contrast , migrants and Turkey itself strongly cultivate civilizational awareness in their own identity politics . The Islamist challenge and the potential of Islamization are based on facts , but they are not well understood in Europe . The Turkish diaspora in Europe , as well as the population in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The European decision-makers have proven in the past to be incapable of designing policies to address challenges arising from ethnic-cultural diversification of the population . European officials neglect or simply ignore cultural issues such as the identity of Europe and Europeanization . <p> L : THE AKP ABANDONS COMPROMISE Compromising and power sharing are an essential part of democratic politics . Repeated experience with Islamists show that they go to the ballots but fail to compromise when they win . The AKP is no exception . Erdogan wanted to promote his foreign minister , Abdullah Gill , to the presidency in 2007 , and he did so at the expense of a traditional process of consensus-building among opposition parties and so sparked a political crisis . While the AKP won subsequent parliamentary elections , its victory had as much to do with the weakness of the secularist parties as with satisfaction with the AKP . The 2007 election win enabled the AKP to retrench , sending Gl to ankaya palace as the first non-secular president of Turkey . <p> With its majority solidified and no longer fearing the veto of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . Here , the head scarf is especially important . Among Islamists , the head scarf is not just an article of clothing but an icon of civilizational divide . Islamists view the head scarf as a provision of the Shari'a. n30 It has become symbolic of the tension between Europeanization and Islamization . In a 2004 ruling , the European Court of Human Rights found the right to a head scarf not to be a human right , thus dismissing an Islamist lawsuit. n31 Upon their reelection , though , the AKP decided to provoke secular elites with legislation enabling female university students to wear a head scarf on campus and in classes . On June 5 , 2008 , the Turkish Supreme Court deemed the AKP 's law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it eroded Turkey 's secular character. n32 Soon after , the London-based pan-Arabic daily Al-Hayat quoted Erdogan as stating , " We are going to shut down the constitutional court . " n33 Many Europeans have cheered Erdogan and condemned court actions in Turkey . AKP partisans in the Turkish press and proponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States and Europe labeled Turkish secularists as " fascists " and accused them of undermining " democratic " Islamists. n34 Zeyno Baran observed that such an artificial dichotomy " inadvertently strengthens hard-line Islamists. " n35 As the West sides with the Islamists , the opposition , feeling abandoned , has become more anti-Western . Again , Baran explains , " The opposition 's anti-Western stand is more like that of a lover with a broken heart ... they fear that Europeans push them to undertake reforms that will make Turkey more Islamic , and then will tell them that they are too Islamic to join a Western club . " ( n36 ) <p> The crisis continued into the summer as the Constitutional Court heard arguments that the AKP had violated the principles of a democratic and secular Turkish republic. n37 Had the court dissolved the party , it would have toppled the government and plunged the country into political turmoil. n38 The court wanted to avoid this outcome as it would have ended the AKP but not the Islamist challenge . The AKP could simply have transferred its assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as the AKP had emerged from the ashes of Fezilet . The court did not acquit the AKP , however , but instead gave it a strong warning to stop steering Turkey away from the secular order that the constitution mandates towards an Islamic one . Court president Hasim Kili stated , " There is no verdict on closure ... However , in this ruling a serious warning has been issued to the party AKP , and I hope this conclusion will be elevated and will be taken accordingly . " ( n39 ) <p> L : SECULARISM ABANDONED Western politicians , scholars , and opinion leaders barely understand what is going on in Turkey . Too many Western pundits depict Turkey 's increasing Islamism as fortuitous . The Rand Corporation 's Stephen Larrabee , for example , wrote , " Under the AKP , Turkey has emerged as an important diplomatic actor in the region ... without the AKP ... the United States would lose an important partner in trying to stabilize this volatile region ... At the same time , banning the party could undercut efforts to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such views infuriate secular Turks . It is ironic that the intra-Turkish debate on the pernicious nature of Islamism has been more open than the Western one . <p> In the name of democratic reforms , as European diplomats have observed , the AKP has reduced the secular impact of the army , defamed judicial defense of the constitution as a " judicial coup , " expanded the Imam Hatip religious schools and equated them to secular schools , and fired university presidents . Too many in the West praise the AKP as " moderate Islamic . " The only difference , however , between moderate and jihadist Islamists is the use of the ballot box instead of violence to come to power . It may be important to include Islamists in democracy but certainly not with the Western naive notion that inclusion will tame Islamism . This is the lesson that should be drawn from Hamas in Gaza , Hezbollah in Lebanon , and certain Islamist parties in Iraq . <p> Hamas and Hezbollah may be represented in parliaments , but they have kept their militias that represent the antithesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic game is only a tactical step . The AKP may be better than Hamas and Hezbollah since it has no militia although its dominance and use of the police force and secret services have become nearly as abusive . <p> The proper solution for crisis-ridden Turkey is neither the tacit Islamic law of the AKP nor a coup by the Turkish secularists . Rather , the European Union and the United States should encourage the strengthening of civil society by making the weak institutions of Turkish democracy stronger . Moderate Islamists want to Islamize , not democratize. n41 They are committed to the procedure of democracy but not to its pluralistic and peaceful political culture . Political Islam in Turkey is an important issue for Europe . Turkey not only has close relations to the West , but it also has a diaspora of more than four million in the European Union. n42 While many moderate Muslims seek to Europeanize Islam , the Islamism practiced by the AKP is an ideology of cultural divide , tension , and conflict , despite all of the pro-Europe rhetoric in which Islamists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their agenda of Islamization . <p> L : Footnotes  --  ( n1 ) Ihsan Dagi , " Turkey 's AKP in Power , " Journal of Democracy , July 2008 , pp. 25-30 . <p>  --  ( n2 ) Raymond William Baker , Islam without Fear : Egypt and the New Islamists ( Cambridge : Harvard University Press , 2003 ) . <p>  --  ( n3 ) BBC News , July 28 , 2008 ; Los Angeles Times , July 31 , 2008 . <p>  --  ( n4 ) Fatma Mge Goek , Rise of the Bourgeoisie , Demise of Empire .
