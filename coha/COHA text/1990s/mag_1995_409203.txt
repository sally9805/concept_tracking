Folks kept telling me about Mark Sullivan . Said he lived over in Pocohantas , Tennessee , owned his own meat-cutting business at thirty-four , and liked to hunt coon . And all that proved to be true . But that 's not all I learned about him . I found he was a living encyclopedia ; he could be called , " Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Coon Hunting , If You Wanted To Know It Right . " Over the years I 've introduced you to a lot of outdoorsmen  --  most of whom have been tops in their field . But ai n't nobody knows more about coon hunting than Mark . He 's been at it since he was twelve , when he used to climb trees and shake the coons out . Today , he 's the state of the art in his sport . A slab-built guy with a hawkish nose , intense stare , and close-set ears , Mark talks slow but thorough . And as he tells his outspoken and up-front story , you feel the joy he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why is it all you guys go crazy about coon hunting ? Why is the sport so addictive ? " " Oh , we do n't go crazy , " he protests . " But it takes a lot of time to make a good dog , and everybody wants to have the best dogs , you know . I 've been divorced twice . I 'm not saying coon hunting was the only reason for both divorces , but it played a big role . " I do n't think most wives mind their husbands going coon hunting two or three nights a week . The problem is when they start going more often than that . Plus , I 'm a hard hunter and when I 'm going hunting , I 'm hunting tonight . " So , after awhile , you 're gone all night nearly every night . The wife does n't like to be left home alone , so she ends up finding somebody who 'll stay with her . " It 's not something a man goes crazy about , but .... " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he says , " Huh ? " " Never mind , " I say , then ask , " why do n't you have a jumping mule ? " " I love to hunt the bottoms . A mule 's feet are too small and stick in the mud . A horse 's got a bigger foot , plus he 's a lot easier to train . People always talk about the jumping mule ; that 's the hillbilly idea of coon hunting . But my horse jumps . I a just take him up to a four-strand barbed wire fence and dismount . Then I take the long reins with me , stand beside him , and say , " Get up . " He sticks his no out as if to measure the height and then up and over he goes . " If you 're never seen this , folks , it 's fascinating . A coon-hunting mule or horse can stand flatfooted and clear these fences . It 's part of the nostalgia and mystique of the sport . Why the horse ? It sure beats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ask Mark . " Yes , but not necessarily a good puppy trainer . I stay with treein ' Walkers because they 're usually a quick-strike dog and a fast locator on the tree . Plus they can have a good , loud mouth . " I generally start my pups at about four months old . I drag a coon hide around and get'em playing ; then I turn them loose and they chase after it . I hang the hide up and let the dogs tree on it . Some of them will ; some of them wo n't . " Then , I 'll live-trap a coon . I keep him in a rolling cage and have the pups get after that in the yard . Later , I 'll hang the cage in a tree and introduce the pups to treeing . After that , I 'll release it back where I trapped it  --  with the pups chasing right behind . " I do that because you can teach a dog to run a coon up a tree , but you ca n't make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark , you ai n't got a coon dog . " By the time the season starts , the pups about eight to ten months old . The training has taken a lot of the puppy out of them . The final step is to shoot a coon in season for the young dogs to get them excited . " Now , when I start hunting in earnest , I put the young dogs in the woods with a good , settled , middle-age to old-age dog . The older dog helps further train the pups . After the dogs start treeing on their own , I can hunt them by themselves . " One other thing : I sometimes help the dogs learn treeing by squawling a coon out of a tree . " Squawling ? Let me explain . Some coons are nervous ; you 'll see them out on a limb looking around and moving about . You call out  --  make a raucous squawling noise  --  to push the coon out of the tree . As he descends , you trail his tail with your ashlight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get another chance to tree him . All in all , a very effective  --  if extremely noisy  --  training method . Mark adds , " You can pick a pup up , stand him on a tree , and excite him with your voice . Eventually , a pup starts seeing what you 're seeing . " I like the power and simplicity of Mark 's last statement . It 's his way of telling us the dog is learning his business as well as bonding with his handler . This could apply to all gun dogs . " And something else , " adds Mark " I always tie a pup up when I get to the tree where he 's taken a stand . If he 's not interested and not really treeing , I want to know . If you do n't , you may develop a dog that wants to run , but not tree . And he 'll stop at any old tree and lie to you . " I had a buddy who had a female dog that loved to run deer . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to a tree  --  even if there was nothing in it . She 'd be sayin ' ' , " I 'm working , boss , " when she was n't working at all . " There 's also this : say a young dog gets up to about three years old . He 's treein ' good , but you see that he 's missing a lot of things . He trees too quick . The coon might have only rubbed his tail on that tree , but the dog stops right there . He 's got to learn better than that . He 's got to know when the coon actually treed . " I 've said many times that you need birds to train bird dogs . Well , you also need coons to train coon dogs . Here 's how Mark does it . " Live-trapped coons need to be fed if you want any to train on . During the summer I fill a 5-gallon bucket with mixed corn and dog food . I drill a hole on the side of the pail , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The coon can stick is paw in the pipe and rake out the food . Make sure you cover the bottom of the pail with metal . Otherwise , if the pail runs dry , the coon can eat out the bottom . " You can also put these buckets up in a tree over a branch where the coon can stand on and eat . " With free-running coons , Mark takes a different approach . " I go down into the bottoms with my corn , " he says . " At the edge of the mush water , I 'll mash the corn into the ground . When it sours , a coon will dig it up  --  they like it sour . Deer prefer fresh corn , so they wo n't bother with it , which leaves it all for the coons . " Sour corn sites help Mark find coons when he needs them . He also knows other places to take his dogs depending on the time of year . Mark says , " In the spring I go to the bottoms because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the fall , I go to the hills for acorns . " " I wonder how that can be ? " I ask . " I always heard coons have to wash what they eat . " " Yeah , " confirms Mark , " but it ai n't washin ' ' . I understand coons do n't have any saliva glands , so they need moisture to lubricate the swallowing of their food . Even acorns up in the hills have to be taken to the creek to be eaten . " " I 'll be , " I say in marvel . Mark 's still talking as he mounts his horse with a leash on his dog . And with a all that equipment hanging about his body , he starts out for the night . He does n't want to be impolite but he really must be going . I think to myself , as I stand there and watch him leave , If anybody wanted to learn to coon hunt , this would be the guy to go with . I wonder how much I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his eyes , astride one of his horses , behind one of his hounds . <p>
