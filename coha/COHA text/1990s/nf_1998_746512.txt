Solzhenitsyn 's Alternative to Modern Liberalism <p> It has now been twenty years since Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn delivered his famous commencement address at Harvard . More than anything else Solzhenitsyn has written , the address confirmed elite opinion in its conviction that he was not a friend of political liberty . It was said by such authoritative voices as the editorialist for the New York Times that he was a moral fanatic , a True Believer who " believes himself to be in possession of The Truth and so sees error wherever he looks . " ( n1 ) Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , speaking for the vital ( and relativistic ) center , compared Solzhenitsyn to General Curtis ( " **27;683;TOOLONG Age " ) Le May and the Puritan divines of old . In Schlesinger 's view , the illiberal Russian confused himself with " a messenger of God . " ( n2 ) The conservative National Review chimed in , suggesting that Solzhenitsyn was absolutely right about communism but failed to understand America adequately. ( n3 ) Even First Lady Rosalynn Carter jumped into the fray , drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should leave America if he did n't like it . A few lonely voices , such as George F. Will , dissented from the consensus and pointed out that Solzhenitsyn 's ideas were in a venerable tradition of Western philosophical reflection . They were , in fact , " broadly congruent with the ideas of Cicero and other ancients , and those of Augustine , Aquinas , Richard Hooker , Pascal , Thomas More , Burke , Hegel and others . " He pointedly added that " compared to the long and broad intellectual tradition in which Solzhenitsyn 's views are rooted , the tradition of modernity , or liberalism , is short and thin . " ( n4 ) <p> Will 's remarks had the virtue of highlighting the fact that Solzhenitsyn 's critique of the West was to a large extent an internal critique of a society that had increasingly attenuated ties with the best part of its moral and political heritage . Will recognized that Solzhenitsyn 's critique of the West was something much less than a " total " or absolute one. ( n5 ) Solzhenitsyn spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke as a friend who knew that the future of human liberty depended to a large extent on the survival as well as the capacity for self-correction of Western civilization . <p> It is true that he suggested that he could not recommend the West , with its soulless legalism and " mass living habits , " as a " model " for a postcommunist Russia ( HA 7-8 , 12-13 ) . But he also stated his deep admiration for the basic decency , even the magnanimity , of the American people , evidenced by their prodigious philanthropic output . And while he spent more time criticizing the corruption of legalism than expounding the virtues of the rule of law , the author of The Gulag Archipelago also stated , in no uncertain terms , " that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed " ( HA 8 ) . The speech contains not a single criticism of the idea of republican self-government or democratic political institutions . Nevertheless , his critics nearly uniformly confused his criticism of modern or " anthropocentric " humanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply. ( n7 ) <p> Except when talking about what he saw as the deteriorating international situation ( he genuinely feared that detente was weakening the West and giving renewed vitality to a sclerotic Soviet regime ) , Solzhenitsyn 's tone was remarkably measured , shorn of the excessive polemics and overheated rhetoric that sometimes marked his public pronouncements . But he undoubtedly weakened his case by overstating his claims . His partial critique of the West was too easily mistaken for a total one ; the fundamental moderation of his thought was often obscured by the exaggerations that accompanied his probing analysis of the fragility of the Enlightenment foundations of modern liberty . There is some reason to think that Solzhenitsyn himself recognized the inadequacy of his portrait of the West and the world in the Harvard address . This recognition becomes clear from an examination of a major address that Solzhenitsyn delivered in Liechtenstein on 14 September 1993 , just months before returning to his native Russia. ( n8 ) An updating as well as a partial correction of the 1978 address , it is Solzhenitsyn 's final comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADDRESS : RECONSIDERING MODERN LIBERALISM <p> The Liechtenstein address was one of a series of speeches and appearances that Solzhenitsyn delivered in Europe ( and quite strikingly not in America , where he thought many did not wish to hear him out ) before his return to Russia . Speaking before a sympathetic audience of conservative-minded Catholics , Solzhenitsyn reiterated the core themes of the Harvard address but in light of the changed international situation brought about by the fall of Soviet communism and the concomitant end of the Cold War . The tone of his address is less strident than its predecessor 's , even if the apocalyptic or extremist character of the original Harvard address has been much exaggerated . This change of tone or register is connected with both an objective change in the international situation and perhaps , as Edward Ericson has suggested , with a certain mellowing on the part of Solzhenitsyn himself. ( n9 ) Solzhenitsyn 's gaze seems more fixed on what he calls in the Liechtenstein address " the eternal questions , " especially the problem of death and the underlying purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with his advancing age as well as with his sense that civilization still faces many pressing threats but no longer the deadly threat posed by communist ideology . <p> It is also the case that the widespread corruption and moral debility of civil society in the former communist countries has made Solzhenitsyn more appreciative of the basic solidity of Western societies rooted in the rule of law . He goes so far as to state that although the West must recognize the limits of its own experience and respect the " precious pluralism " of the great world cultures , it must also never " lose sight of its own values , its historically unique stability of civic life under the rule of law  --  a hard-won stability which grants independence and space to every private citizen " ( LA 125 ) . These words can be read as a discreet self-correction . Solzhenitsyn admits that if the West is not a " model " for his country to emulate , there are profound dimensions of its experience that Russia and other former communist countries in search of ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already apparent in Solzhenitsyn 's 1990 essay Rebuilding Russia . There he drew on a wide range of Western political thought , from Aristotle to Tocqueville and Karl Popper , as well as on the republican tradition of local self-government in such places as Switzerland and New England , even as he outlined a distinctively Russian path to liberty. ( n10 ) <p> In the 1993 address , Solzhenitsyn expresses a modest recognition that the " moral axesO of society have " fallen into even greater abuse " in the postcommunist societies of the East than in the West ( LA 115 ) . Solzhenitsyn has become painfully aware that the strengthening of human character in the East spoken about in the Harvard address ( HA 12-13 ) was perhaps descriptive of a few sturdy souls like himself but not at all of the vast majority of men and women ground down by the totalitarian juggernaut . This distinction between the effects of totalitarianism on the few and on the many was central to the account in volume 2 of The Gulag Archipelago , " The Soul and Barbed Wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soul experienced in the labor camps. ( n11 ) This is a distinction Solzhenitsyn seemed to lose sight of when confronted by the mediocrity and dispiritedness of Western life during the early years of his exile . The more recent experience of the degradation of personal and political life in postcommunist Russia , the rampant corruption and lawlessness , the widespread disregard for ordinary standards of moral decency and public probity , have reminded Solzhenitsyn that the moral bases of the Western societies are perhaps sturdier than he had originally recognized . In any case , Solzhenitsyn was never a radical right-wing critic of liberal democracy who associated it , in the manner of Heidegger or Carl Schmitt , with the ultimate human degradation. ( n12 ) If some readers had trouble seeing this in the Harvard address , they have no excuse with the more recent text . <p> The Liechtenstein address begins with a direct evocation of one of the main themes of the 1978 speech : the fate of civic courage in the modern West ( HA 5-6 ) . Solzhenitsyn contrasts the behavior of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the aftermath of World War II , with that of the tiny principality of Liechtenstein in regard to the treatment of Soviet citizens who did not wish to be repatriated to the Soviet Union . Liechtenstein decided to shelter a detachment of Russian anticommunists seeking refuge from Stalin 's tyranny even as the powerful democracies , proclaiming the verities of the Atlantic Charter and the democratic bases of a liberated Europe , returned hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens , " against their expressed will , " to be killed or to languish in the Gulag ( LA 113 ) . This " last secret " of World War II , as Solzhenitsyn called it in The Gulag Archipelago , ( n13 ) is for him the most concrete sign of the West 's inability to pursue what he once called a " proud , principled and open defense of human freedom . " ( n14 ) <p> The example of Liechtenstein shows the necessary connection between morality and civic courage and hence the " justifiable and necessary share of morality in politics " ( LA 114 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify morality with quiescence or an apolitical subservience to the powers that be . There is no morality without a spirited or courageous willingness to defend human dignity against those who imperil it . Hence his tribute , in volume 3 of The Gulag Archipelago , to " the committed escapers " and to those who took part in camp revolts. ( n15 ) <p> In investigating the question of the legitimate role of morality in politics , Solzhenitsyn renews his critique of the Enlightenment . In Solzhenitsyn 's view , the Enlightenment , as represented by John Locke , dangerously divorced moral and political concerns . Defenders of liberalism might reply that Locke and the other philosophical architects of liberal societies had not dispensed with moral considerations but rather had articulated a new moral vision , the morality of the individual governing himself within a law-based civil association. ( n16 ) Whatever the merits of this response , Solzhenitsyn is correct to observe that liberalism begins with a dogmatic denial that the care of the soul can be a part of the legislative art . Solzhenitsyn cites as an alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not some theocratic or moralistic identification of the two , but the decidedly nonfanatical and nonmoralistic Christian humanist Erasmus , who believed that a moderate and modest politics must still " manifest ethical impulses " ( LA 114 ) . <p> Solzhenitsyn is thus no mere moralist . He sketches a middle way between a Machiavellian denial of a place for moral criteria in political life and an unreasonable , simple-minded identification of the two . He recognizes that the morality of individual and social or associative life is necessarily distinct from that of political life . There can be " no exact equivalence " between the morality of the two realms , " as the scales , the momentum and the tasks of governmental structures introduce a certain deformation . " Yet he insists that statesmen must be guided by an understanding of " the difference between honesty , baseness and deception , between magnanimity , goodness , avarice and evil " and that this understanding " must to a large degree be applied to the politics of countries , governments , parliaments and parties " ( LA 115 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " enlightened " or modern understanding of the relationship between politics and ethics , Solzhenitsyn restates a politic understanding of the flexibility appropriate to the statesman in addressing problems of common life or the exigencies of extreme situations confronting the survival or even the well-being of the political community . But in an argument reminiscent of Jacques Maritain 's critique of Machiavellianism , ( n17 ) Solzhenitsyn also insists on the pragmatic necessity of a statecraft guided by a " moral compass " : this turns out to be " in the long run , the most prudent behavior for one 's own future " ( LA 115 ) . In his effort to do justice to the distinct but overlapping requirements of political and moral life , Solzhenitsyn identifies himself with a premodern sensibility , represented in modern times by the likes of Hooker , Thomas More , and Burke , that rejects moral fanaticism while avoiding the atheism and covert Machiavellianism of modern humanism . <p> Solzhenitsyn suggests that Russian thinkers such as Vladimir Solovyov have successfully resisted the Enlightenment divorce of politics and ethics and the liberal reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have maintained , against the dogmatism of the Enlightenment , an understanding of politics as moral service ( LA 115 ) . But it is in this context that Solzhenitsyn admits , as a Russian , his " present vulnerability . . . in passing such judgments " ( LA 115 ) . The point , he suggests , is not to parcel out blame or to highlight the respective weaknesses of East or West , but rather to contribute to the recovery of a truthful and salutary understanding of the relation between politics and ethics . <p> After rejecting the utilitarianism of Bentham  --  who defined morality as " that which gives pleasure to the greatest number " and who reduced the social world to " cold calculation " ( LA 116 ) " Solzhenitsyn turns to a remarkably astute and measured analysis of the modern notion of progress . THE POLITICS OF PROGRESS <p> Solzhenitsyn proposes no political alternative to the world of modern democracy or , for that matter , to the modern project as a whole . He recognizes that the politics of progress will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human abilities will " continue to be perfected ; they can not and must not , be brought to a halt " ( LA 117 ) . The modern world , marked by what the French philosophes first called progress , the relentless development of the arts and sciences , of commerce and technological civilization , should be taken as a " gift from on high , sent down for an extremely intricate trial of our free will " ( LA 120 ) . <p> Solzhenitsyn 's account of the original project for progress , with its grandiose hopes for a " general mollification of the human temperament " ( LA 117 ) , is a generally accurate if somewhat schematic account of the hopes placed in doux commerce by the advocates of modern enlightenment . Solzhenitsyn 's objection is less to the fact of economic and scientific development , which within proper bounds serves the cause of human freedom and dignity , than to a fallacious scientism and economism . These approaches fail to appreciate that the " only true Progress " is " the sum total of the spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of their lives " ( LA 128 ) . In the Harvard address , Solzhenitsyn criticized the founding principles of modern Western states for obscuring that truth . Modern liberalism reduced politics to an inordinate concern for " mere life , " with the state serving human happiness understood primarily in terms of material aggrandizement and comfortable self-preservation . Modern technical and social progress culminated inevitably in a cult of " well-being " in which the unlimited pursuit of personal pleasures paradoxically undermines the resilience of the human organism . The hedonism of modern thought is an uncertain foundation for human flourishing : human beings need constraints or limits to exercise their freedom intelligently and vigorously ( HA 7 ) . <p> The project of anthropocentric humanism , of which liberal commercial states and communist totalitarianism are competing expressions , is based on a turning away from the problem of human mortality . Modern mass society is dedicated to diverting human beings from a confrontation with the human meaning of death . The citizens of modern societies are " totally engrossed in everyday life " ( HA 19 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " dictatorship " of " average everydayness , " in which humans , lost in the conformism of what " they " say , avoid any direct confrontation with their finitude . In such a social condition , " mystery loses its power , " and there is " a levelling down of all possibilities of being . " ( n18 ) <p> The 1993 address clearly builds on the critique of anthropocentricity and of " the total engrossment in everyday life " limned in the Harvard address . Yet its tone is more measured . In this rendering , progress is now our " predestined circle , " to use an appropriate Tocquevillian formulation. ( n19 ) Solzhenitsyn resists all dreaming about some agrarian or premodern utopia unsullied by continuing technological development or social conflicts . <p> Solzhenitsyn 's real enemy is progressivism , the belief that technological and commercial development necessarily entails moral and even political progress . This conceit reached demonic proportions in the ludicrous claims of communist ideology , the so-called Progressive Doctrine so fiercely reproached throughout The Gulag Archipelago . The Progressive Doctrine has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose thought modern humanism reached its aggressively atheistic apex : " Marx for one , concluded that history will lead us to justice without the help of God " ( LA 117 ) . In the Harvard address , Solzhenitsyn had argued that communism was the most consistent version of modern humanism and materialism , the one most divorced from " the great reserves of mercy and sacrifice " that were the most important " moral heritage " of the premodern Christian West ( HA 17 ) . Marxist historicism is the effectual truth of modern progress divorced from the humanizing effects of premodern moral capital . <p> Solzhenitsyn raises three fundamental objections to the modern doctrine of progress understood as the moral progress of the human race . The first is an environmentalist or neo-Malthusian one . The conquest of nature , in this view , eats up precious and limited resources with no concern for replenishing them or for the situation of future generations . Like his previous discussion of ecological themes in The Letter to the Soviet Leaders ( 1973 ) , this point of Solzhenitsyn 's understates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also accepts without serious analysis the highly pessimistic calculations of the Club of Rome and other proponents of limited growth that predict environmental catastrophe. ( n20 ) But in his defense one should note that communism 's perfervid efforts to conquer nature and create a new society and economy led to unprecedented ecological catastrophe . In the Liechtenstein address , Solzhenitsyn welcomes the collapse of communism as the " disintegration of the world 's most senseless , recklessly wasteful economy " ( LA 118 ) . Here he is absolutely on target ; Marxism-Leninism radicalized the technological hubris of modernity . There were few democratic or moral constraints on the command economy . As David Landes has recently observed , the Soviet regime destroyed things with the same reckless abandon with which it killed people . The destruction of the Aral Sea , once one of the world 's greatest freshwater bodies , now bereft of fish and poisoned beyond recognition ; the regime 's fantastic plans to divert and reverse the flow of Siberian rivers ; and the devastation of Chernobyl all reveal the " megalomania " that marked its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific empirical judgments , Solzhenitsyn is undoubtedly right to highlight the inadequacy of the modern project to make humankind the " masters and possessors of nature . " Communism powerfully reveals the bankruptcy of that project in its original and unchecked form . <p> The second misjudgment of the modern doctrine is its expectation that human nature will become " gentler with Progress " ( LA 118 ) . Solzhenitsyn undoubtedly has in mind the experience of modern totalitarianism , which in the name of creating a " new man " established an unprecedentedly virulent form of despotism . It must be said , however , that his analysis is not always consistent on this score . Undoubtedly the great proponents of the softening effects of commerce , such as Montesquieu , were mistaken when they announced that , in conjunction with liberal politics , commerce would " cure " modern peoples of Machiavellianism or excessive cruelty ( The Spirit of the Laws , book 21 , chapter 20 ) . They underestimated the possibilities of a new form of rationalist or ideological politics , an " impious cruelty " far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that the architects of the politics of progress fatefully forgot about the requirements of the soul , and hence the constant need for human self-restraint and self-examination . He is undoubtedly right that technocentric progress can not satisfy the needs of the soul , or , for that matter , cope with what Burke famously called in Reflections on the Revolution in France " the inventiveness of wickedness . " Human beings inhabit a moral universe where good and evil are ever-present possibilities . In addition , the scope and severity of evil are radicalized by the new tools made available by modern progress as well as by ideology 's pseudoscientific denial of the permanent existence of evil. ( n23 ) Yet when Solzhenitsyn criticizes the cult of material well-being or the belief that " man is born for happiness " ( HA 19 ) he is also suggesting that the project of doux commerce is problematic because it succeeds only too well in softening human beings , in undermining their determination to defend freedom or to thoughtfully cultivate their souls . <p> Solzhenitsyn is undoubtedly right that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not satisfy the human soul . In large part because it succeeds all too well in delivering what it promises , modern progress succeeds in effacing any deep concern for the purpose of things . By evading the " eternal questions " it unintentionally gives birth to immoderate and irrational responses , including " the howl of existentialism " ( LA 120 ) and the nihilistic posturing of postmodernist theory . <p> For Solzhenitsyn , the challenge of modernity is precisely a challenge to the soul : No alternative set of institutions or ideologies can solve a problem that is ultimately deeper than the political or institutional level . The challenge is characteristic of all modern regimes , whether they be capitalist , socialist , or dedicated to some elusive " third way . " All modern regimes necessarily promote modernization and economic and technological development and hence participate in the imperatives of progress . In the Harvard address , Solzhenitsyn called for a new human order in which human beings ' " physical nature will not be cursed , as in the Middle Ages , but even more importantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Modern Era " ( HA 20 ) . In both speeches he called for a dialectical ascent from modernity in the name of " freely accepted and serene self-restraint " ( HA 19 and LA 125-28 ) . Whether such self-restraint can become a politically inscribed feature of modern societies , somehow palpably affecting their operations as societies , is a question I will return to later in this essay . But few critics of the Harvard address appreciated ( a noticeable exception is Sidney Hook ) ( n24 ) that Solzhenitsyn 's criticism of the " ossified formulas " ( HA 19 ) of the Enlightenment did not by any means suggest a political rejection of democracy or the principle of self-government . AN EXCURSUS ON SOLZHENITSYN AND DEMOCRACY <p> The democratic , even populist dimensions of Solzhenitsyn 's thought have become clearer within the political context of postcommunist Russia. ( n25 ) He has been a sharp critic of the oligarchic features of the new Russia , lamenting the continued bureaucratic and centralized nature of its politics and its domination by a morally unscrupulous elite made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 123 ) . He repeatedly has called for the establishment of genuinely democratic institutions of local self-government and has appealed to the prerevolutionary experience of the zemstvo , an institution that needs to be modernized in light of Russia 's nonaristocratic social state. ( n26 ) In the 1993 address , he discusses the situation of the postcommunist successor states to the USSR in only a few paragraphs , but he makes clear that the " non-producing capitalism " in place in Russia and other former Soviet republics only feeds the nostalgia of an " unprepared and unprotected " population for what he calls " the equality in poverty of the past " ( LA 123 ) . <p> He does not oppose , in principle , the efforts to build representative institutions or a market economy in Russia and has nothing but contempt for the illiberal posturing of the so-called Red-Brown coalition . A fiercely anticommunist patriot , he has become an advocate for the " humiliated and the injured , " for all those overlooked by the new wave of Russian reforms. ( n27 ) As his occasional public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian literary journal Novy Mir make clear , Solzhenitsyn supports entrepreneurship and free commerce but only when guided by moral criteria . He firmly rejects the demagoguery of the communist Left and ultranationalist Right , and he is one of the few responsible voices to point out that Russians must build a moral polity or " none at all . " ( n28 ) <p> But Solzhenitsyn has not always avoided moralism in his public pronouncements . An admirer of Pyotr Stolypin , the great statesman who dreamed of a Russia of sturdy citizen-proprietors , he has opposed the Yeltsin government 's land reform bill because foreigners and unscrupulous profiteers might benefit from it . He thus contributes unintentionally to the perpetuation of a system of collectivized agriculture that he himself loathes. ( n29 ) The novelist who powerfully exposed the stifling of individual initiative under communism is " for individual energy , for active engineers and against the bureaucrats of the old regime " but is also against " the reign of money . " ( n30 ) Although insisting on the measured character of his recommendations , Solzhenitsyn often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a purer " moral enterprise " than could be reasonably expected of any political community. ( n31 ) He thereby undermines his quite legitimate criticisms of an elite shorn of that sense of moral responsibility that would justify its " leading role " in the new society . <p> Whatever the limits of Solzhenitsyn 's present political perspective , he is right to observe that Russia 's " non-producing capitalism " is in some ways a kind of perverse imitation of democratic modernity . The Russian example does , however , serve as a salutary warning to both East and West of the necessary dependence of modern societies on premodern moral capital . Solzhenitsyn is also right to claim that the official philosophy of our societies does little to justify or rekindle that precious capital . THE EFFECT OF PROGRESS ON THE HUMAN SOUL <p> Let us return to Solzhenitsyn 's exploration of the theme of the soul of man under the dispensation of modern progress . What is the character of this " extremely intricate trial " ( LA 120 ) that the triumph of progress poses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by observing that the immoderate use of the technological tools of modernity , such as the telephone and television , " fragment the wholeness of our time , jerking us from the natural flow of our life " ( LA 120 ) . Even the tremendous gift of life expectancy has made the elderly a burden for their children and doomed " the former to a lingering loneliness , to abandonment in old age by loved ones , and to an irreparable rift from the joy of passing on their experience to the young " ( LA 120 ) . It is hard to quarrel with these observations , which simply describe universally recognized features of life in prosperous and individualistic consumer societies . But Solzhenitsyn roots the discontents or consequences of modern progress in our experience of everydayness , in the fact that modern men and women are " consumed in the pursuit of material interests " ( LA 120 ) . The engrossment in everydayness is in fact a diversion from the fundamental human experiences and hence leads to an unacceptable , " overwhelming loneliness " ( LA 120 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " howl of existentialism , " which confuses the spiritual aridity that haunts modern life with the ungroundedness of things simply . Since the world has no intrinsic meaning , the self must will a path for itself . It must commit itself but without reference to the intrinsic natural goods or contents of life . Solzhenitsyn proposes another more truthful response to the modern experience of homelessness in the world . Without rejecting the world of progress , which is inseparable from the cultivation of the arts of human intelligence , he proposes a heroic effort to confront " the eternal questions " to which modern individuals have returned by a " complex and twisted curve " ( LA 120 ) . The task of modern men and women is to avoid becoming " playthings of Progress " by seeking ways of directing Progress " towards the perpetration of the good " ( LA 120 ) . The means of this perpetration is the " golden key " ( LA 125 ) of self-restraint or voluntary self-limitation , the Solzhenitsyn theme par excellence . Modernity 's initial mistake , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological efficiency , and the softening effects of commerce would enable human beings to dispense with the need to confront directly , forthrightly , and humbly their spiritual destiny . The result of this forgetting or obfuscation has been a disruption of the natural harmony between the spiritual and physical natures of human beings . In addition , it has contributed to a debilitating moral relativism that covers over the permanent , primordial distinction between Good and Evil . Sophisticated modern men and women take a perverse pleasure in ridiculing the moral constitution of human beings ( LA 120 ) . <p> Above all , the total engrossment in everyday life has led to a diverting of our eyes from the inescapability of death . In a striking passage combining a Pascalian critique of divertissement with an " ancient " ( Stoic and Christian ) perspective on death , Solzhenitsyn writes : <p> And nothing so bespeaks the current helplessness of our spirit , our intellectual disarray , as the loss of a clear and calm attitude towards death . The greater his well-being , the deeper the chilling fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass fear , a fear the ancients did not know , was born of our insatiable , loud and bustling life . Man has lost the sense of himself as a limited point in the universe , albeit one possessed of free will . He began to deem himself the center of his surroundings , adapting not himself to the world but the world to himself . And then , of course , the thought of death becomes unbearable : it is the extinction of the entire universe at a stroke . ( LA 121 ) <p> Solzhenitsyn 's call for a clear and calm attitude toward death is linked to his recognition of " an unchanging Higher Power above us , " what he also calls in the same address " a Whole and Higher Authority " ( LA 121 , 127 ) . In the Harvard address , Solzhenitsyn uses similar deistic or quasi-philosophical language , referring to God as a " Superior Spirit " ( HA 19-20 ) . None of this , however , suggests that Solzhenitsyn is less than serious in his public embrace of Orthodox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who dismissed Solzhenitsyn as a " Slavophile " or " Orthodox " critic of the West have radically misappraised his approach. ( n32 ) In relatively calm , descriptive language , characteristic of a philosophic historian or a moral phenomenologist , Solzhenitsyn attempts dispassionately to describe the situation of modern man . He does not allow any specifically theological or sectarian claims to distort his description or to estrange him from his audience , which includes the secular elites of the Western world . He engages in a Pascalian or Heideggerian critique of diversion or average everydayness , but in order to show that a permanent " human order of things " persists . He combines Pascalian " existentialism " with classical realism . At the center of the order of things is the destiny , fate , and progress of the individual soul . <p> In his 1993 speech to the National Arts Club in New York , Solzhenitsyn argued that at the end of the Cold War Western man risks becoming even more unhinged by a postmodernism that " affirms that the world does not possess values that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attitude leads to a thoroughgoing distortion of both philosophy and literature . Postmodernists display a solipsistic inwardness that forgets that true self-discovery entails the fullest confrontation with the eternal questions rooted in the very structure of the world . They give " heightened importance " to the concept of play , but this playfulness is divorced from any sense of responsibility as well as from any deep appreciation that the universe itself is " overflowing with Joy "  --  the postmodernists have no sense of the sublime playfulness so apparent in the work of Mozart , for example. ( n34 ) In their willful destruction of the foundations of true culture , the postmodernists illustrate that " nothing worthy can be built on a neglect of higher meanings and in a relativistic view of concepts and culture as a whole . " ( n35 ) <p> Solzhenitsyn argues that the Cold War was a kind of blessing in disguise for the West . It gave Western society " something of a unifying purpose of existence , " and it enabled free peoples to escape the grips of materialist self-absorption through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( LA 122 ) . Of course , many intellectuals and politicians misunderstood the real nature of communism , and some ludicrously mistook it for the most advanced expression of human freedom . Yet the political leaders of the Western world stood up to the communist threat with some constancy and determination . Solzhenitsyn praises them for their responsibility , which " preserved the West and allowed for victory in the struggles for Berlin and Korea , for the survival of Greece and Portugal " ( LA 122 ) . <p> In this way , too , Solzhenitsyn moderates the one-sided critique of Western statecraft developed in the Harvard address . The decline of civic courage in the West was real enough and , Solzhenitsyn rightly suggests , was exacerbated by the founding principles of liberal states that valorize the rights of man at the expense of civic and moral obligations ( HA 8 ) . Yet the Western political class ( for all intents and purposes , this means the American political class ) showed themselves to be better , that is more courageous and determined , than our principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's victory over communism . The victory depended to a large extent on the civic courage of the West , responsible leadership and statesmanship ( Solzhenitsyn highlights the role of President Reagan ) ( LA 122 ) , as well as the debilitating decrepitude of the communist elites , a decrepitude that Solzhenitsyn recognized but perhaps underestimated in 1978 . <p> Solzhenitsyn believes that as the twenty-first century approaches the spiritual vacuum of modern life " stands out all the more " ( LA 123 ) . At the end of the nineteenth century , next to no one ( Dostoevsky was a notable exception , Solzhenitsyn observes ) predicted the totalitarianism that would deform the coming century ( LA 123 ) . At the end of the twentieth century it is next to impossible to predict the fundamental direction of the coming century . However , if the lessons of our century are properly understood , the task facing citizens of the coming one becomes immediately clear : the reconciliation of the imperatives of progress with those of voluntary self-restraint . SELF-LIMITATION <p> The final section of the 1993 address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Solzhenitsyn insists that it , and it alone , provides the means for turning progress toward the perpetration of the good . It alone allows for the advantages of modernity to be preserved while protecting the soul from engrossment in everydayness . It alone will allow humankind to adopt a new attitude toward nature and , as a result , to avoid looming ecological catastrophe . As I have already stressed , Solzhenitsyn emphasizes the voluntary character of such self-restraint . Yet he believes that it can have salutary political consequences even as he admits that it will create new difficulties for an economic and social order centered on the cycle of production and consumption ( LA 126-27 ) . Solzhenitsyn emphatically denies that his is a utopian position ; it is rather a pragmatic response to the crisis of our time that does justice to the irresistibility of modern progress . <p> I have my doubts that progress and self-restraint can be fully reconciled at the social and economic level . It is not apparent that individual initiative and entrepreneurial energies can flourish outside a social context that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dynamism and energy of modern society demand a mechanism of invention , movement , consumption , and change . That machine , inseparable from our liberties and prosperity , and hence from democratic self-government , also poses grave threats to the integrity of our souls . But as Solzhenitsyn himself recognizes , the " trial " posed by modern progress is an opportunity as much as it is a threat . His searching diagnosis of our situation contributes to a more lucid understanding of ourselves . But perhaps even he is a bit sanguine about the possibility of a postmodernist reconciliation of the requirements of the soul and the body , of antiquity and modernity . <p> Yet the beginning of wisdom is self-understanding . In a quieter voice , with more measure and appreciable doubts than were heard at Harvard in 1978 , Solzhenitsyn analyzes the condition of modern man in the post-totalitarian age . He ends his 1993 address by rejecting the " naive fable " of the " end of history " and its accompanying faith in the " triumph of an all-democratic bliss " ( LA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals the fragility of the entire modern faith in moral progress . There is perhaps no more withering critic of progressivism , of the illusion of perpetual moral and political progress so dear to all the parties of modern politics , than he . <p> Much of the hostility to Solzhenitsyn has its roots precisely in a visceral reaction to his challenge to our faith in progress . This should not surprise us . As the political philosopher Pierre Manent has eloquently observed , modern man is that being who is in flight from the goods of his nature , from any kind of heteronomous law or domination . He writes : <p> Intent on methodically taking all the steps that are destined to free him from all discomfort , whether of feeling cold or guilty , modern man is concerned only with the instruments of his emancipation project or with the obstacles to it . Nothing substantial , be it law , good , cause , or purpose , either holds his attention or holds back his advance any longer . He has become a runner and will go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In highlighting the futility of the modern effort to escape from the question of the ultimate purpose of things , Solzhenitsyn has become the equivalent of the unwanted guest at a cocktail party who insists on talking about something other than frivolities . It does not particularly matter if he genuinely speaks to us " as a friend , not as an adversary " ( HA 3 ) . It does not matter if he shares our confidence in the indispensability of republican or self-governing institutions . As Delba Winthrop has written : We will accept criticism of democracy only from the Left  --  in the name of the radicalization of modernity 's principles. ( n37 ) We do not want to hear that liberty needs other , sturdier moral roots and foundations . <p>
