<p> Yikes ! Want to inflame emotions ? Mention the quality of American cars , as Dr. Gridlock did in a recent column . While Chrysler Chairman Lee ( So what if my company lost $ 800 million last year , I got my $ 4.5 million compensation ) Iacocca and other American auto moguls were bashing the Japanese in Tokyo , I wrote about the chronic transmission problems I and some friends had with Iacocca 's Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyagers . <p> I suggested that maybe it was time to buy a Japanese-built car . To some readers , I might as well have burned an American flag . The volume of responses topped even the should-we-have-HOV-lanes survey ( also about evenly split ) , except that people were more impassioned on this one . Some examples : Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> Enough American car bashing already ! Whoever said that Iacocca builds the best American cars anyway ? My wife and I own four American cars and would own more if we had the parking space ! All four still have their original engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oldsmobile with 122,000 miles , a 22-year-old Buick with 112,000 miles ; a 10-year-old Chevrolet with 83,000 miles and a five-year-old Chevrolet with 59,500 . All are solid , dependable cars that have NEVER had any major repairs . <p> It was a good friend of mine who called ME last fall when his wonderful Honda left his family stranded on the Dulles Access Road . <p> It will be a long time before I will squeeze into a Japanese car and purchase it . CORY CORRELL Gaithersburg <p> In Praise of Toyota <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> If you 're serious about buying a new car , may I suggest a Toyota ? <p> My husband and I have purchased , or have influenced the purchase of 17 Toyotas among family members . I regret to say we abuse the heck out of them , but they never let us down . We 'd be fools to buy anything but a new Toyota . <p> Best of luck car-wise  --  you deserve a break ! SUZANNE MELANCON Burke <p> Reader 's Advice : Buy American <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we own 14 American cars  --  six Fords , five Chryslers and three General Motors machines . They total 1.17 million miles . Not one of us has ever experienced a problem . Accidents on some , routine maintenance on all , but no horror stories . <p> Dr. Gridlock , I urge you to stand fast on the home front and buy American , not just in the auto market , but in all goods ! The job you save may be yours ! DIRK A. GRIFFIN Gaithersburg <p> Duped by Detroit <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> I too was duped by the pleas of Lee Iacocca and the throngs to " Buy American . " I actually sold Chryslers in the 1980s and extolled the quality commitment to more than one skeptical tire-kicker . I was sold . America was back in the race for dominance in the auto industry . . . . NOT ! <p> I bought a 1987 Chrysler LeBaron . Since Day One , problems . From a heater core to faulty shoulder belts to a fuel injection defect to strange noises from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Contrast that with the experience of my fiance : She bought a new Mitsubishi Gallant . In one year she has returned the car once  --  the wiper blade streaked ! DEAN McGLASSON Vienna <p> Transmission Troubles <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> We are not trying to one-up you , with your three transmissions in 40,000 miles , but we 've had FIVE new or rebuilt transmissions in our Chrysler Jeep Wagoneer ( mileage : 6,319 , 6,776 , 15,246 , 29,655 , and 41,449  --  at which point the basic question still was not answered : " What causes this Jeep to eat transmissions ? " ) The Jeep died in September 1991 of the same symptoms it suffered from the first transmission attack . LEISA and RAYMOND URRUTIA Sterling <p> Chrysler vs . Honda <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> Congratulations on taking a stand and speaking the truth about American cars . As an American , I was embarrassed by Bush and buddies whining and complaining in Japan . What makes them think they can sell cars in Japan that they ca n't sell in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 56,000 miles ) and a 1983 Honda ( 160,000 miles ) . <p> The Chrysler : Into the shop three times for stalling , the paint is cracked , the interior trim is coming apart , and the mechanism that controls the side-view mirror has n't worked since a couple weeks after I bought the car . <p> The Honda : Has never broken down or needed anything but normal maintenance . ANN T. SOMERSET Gaithersburg <p> Do n't Bash American Cars <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> In view of your lengthy bashing American cars , I feel in fairness you should give some space to the other side . I do n't believe your experience is typical . <p> Of my last three American cars , I drove two well over 100,000 miles with no major repairs . My present car , a 1984 Plymouth , has not required anything other than routine maintenance . Compare this to the $ 1,200 repair job for the Toyota in the adjoining driveway not long ago . <p> However , even if I were unhappy with American cars , never would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for friends , relatives and millions of others who were casualties of World War II . Obviously , your generation , and the succeeding one , either were never exposed to history or are uncaring of the tremendous sacrifices made by my generation . And so you and millions of other unthinking Americans continue to build up the economy of these nations to the detriment of our own . JOSEPH LEE HUDSON Arlington <p> Dr. Gridlock 's father is a World War II vet . I 'm a Vietnam vet . I respect vets , but I 'd also like to have a car that runs . <p> Just Buy the Best <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> My husband was a young Marine in World War II and fought four years in the Pacific . We , like many others , will buy American cars when quality improves and prices are competitive . <p> PS Look what happened to Vice President Quayle ; they sent him an American car in France and the brakes gave out . HELENE McLANE Bethesda <p> U.S. Manufacturers Faulted <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me state that I have 14 years of experience working in international trade . I know unfair trade practices when I see them , and I 'm not here to defend Japan 's industrial policies . But I also know from bitter personal experience that Detroit has itself to blame for the mess it finds itself in today . <p> Like you , I bought a 1989 Dodge Grand Caravan . Then , when things started to go wrong , I found out the dealer was impossible to work with ; he would not stand behind the product . I had transmission problems that were never really solved , and it seemed whenever I turned the car on , something else was going wrong . <p> I took the car to the dealer and took the assistant service manager for a ride . I pointed out the following problems : 1 ) cruise control inoperative ; 2 ) FM radio static when the engine was running , not when engine off ; 3 ) a clunking noise like a bad universal joint ; and 4 ) a whine when driving that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car up , only the cruise control had been fixed . When I asked about the other items , our conversation went like this : <p> The radio interference : <p> He : The mechanic could not hear the radio interference . <p> Me : I do n't care what the mechanic heard . You heard it ; that 's why I took you for a ride . <p> He : ( shrug ) . <p> The clunking noise : <p> He : That 's the exhaust manifold bracket . It loosens up a little over time . It 's normal . <p> Me : So what you 're saying is that Chrysler has decided I can just live with that . <p> He : Well , I would n't put it that way . <p> Me : Just how would you put it ? <p> He : ( shrug ) <p> The whining noise : <p> He : That 's normal <p> Me : I 'll bet you $ 10 , right now , that we can take a new Caravan off the lot for a drive and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I do n't need this kind of aggravation . I now own a Honda Accord wagon . I love it . <p> When I see General Motors chairman Robert Stempel blame the public and the media for GM 's troubles , and Lee Iacocca with his self-serving baloney , all I can say is this : I am a loyal American . I have tried your products . They are junk , your service is insulting and I 'll be damned if I owe you one red cent of the multimillion dollar salaries that you receive for running a U.S. industry into the ground . BOB ROBESON Woodbridge <p> Brain Drain Faulted <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> Our problems started when President Kennedy decided to send a man to the moon . It began a brain drain that became a torrent . Many of the best scientists , engineers , and manufacturing experts were attracted by the space and defense contractors with extraordinary salaries , and the glamour of out-of-this-world projects . <p> Unfortunately , the humdrum business of making ordinary things like TVs , VCRs and autos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al . jumped in to fill the vacuum . <p> If JFK had instead proposed a million-dollar contest for a reliable transmission , billions would have been saved , and we would have American cars that run . <p> P.S. As a World War II survivor , I simply can not buy a Japanese car . But my 1990 Ford Tempo 's transmission failed on Day 2 , and after repairs still sticks in low gear . DAVID W. PENDLETON Mount Vernon <p> In Defense of U.S. Workers <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> I am greatly disappointed in your views on American cars . If you want to solve your car problem , buy a Ford . <p> I hope that you understand that when you cut down American cars , you are telling every American car worker that they are not doing their jobs correctly . In addition , they can lose their job because of people like you . Almost anyone can lose their jobs in a recession with people like you bashing American products . <p> At least those workers are good for something . Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles in The Post . And your friend draws cartoons . Whoa ! I hope that later I could have jobs like you two . CHRIS HOOFNAGLE Rockville <p> An American Tragedy <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> Re : Chrysler vs . Japanese cars . You said it , and keep saying it . I have been intimately involved with two Chrysler products and two Nissans . <p> Chryslers were junk , hundreds of dollars for this and that , a basic design in the K cars that lasted from model year to model year . The dealer said , " Yeah , but so what ? " <p> The Nissans : $ 170 repairs after 75,000 miles total on the two cars . Solid , dependable , comfortable , cheaper than Chrysler . <p> Lee Iacocca 's pleading is an American tragedy . CHRIS DICKON Norfolk <p> Perspective on ' Lemons ' <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> I 'm sympathetic toward the problems you have experienced with your van . An unreliable and expense-prone vehicle can be a real headache . Try to keep it in perspective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some " lemons , " and the domestic makers ( which still own about 65 percent of the U.S. market despite import penetration ) will naturally produce more , in raw numbers , than the Japanese . <p> If buying Japanese next time will make you feel better , fine . I wish you better luck with your next vehicle , regardless of national origin . However , I think you owe your readership a more balanced and objective viewpoint . DAVID STINE Frederick <p> That was the point of this exercise today . Thanks to all who wrote ! I 'm left agreeing with Ms. McLane of Bethesda , who also said , " You buy what is in your interest . " I am troubled at the number of people who believe they should dictate what others buy , and wonder , in these harder times , if that sentiment wo n't grow . Now , here 's an epilogue that might be helpful : <p> Hot Line for Owners <p> Dear Dr. Gridlock : <p> You and your readers should know about the AutoLine program of the Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car makers participate in this program . It deals with disputes between car makers and owners . <p> As a senior arbitrator for the Bureau , I 've decided dozens of cases , sometimes in favor of the customer , sometimes not . The car manufacturer agrees in advance to accept the arbitrator 's decision . The customer , on the other hand , may accept the arbitrator 's decision or reject it . <p> The service is free . Keep in mind that if the car is out of warranty , it does not mean that the arbitrator may not make an award for the customer . This may happen if the arbitrator finds that the problem has been caused by a defect in materials or workmanship . <p> The AutoLine program for the Metro area is in Arlington and can be reached by calling 703-524-6581 . EDWARD E. NICHOLAS JR . Merrifield <p> Thanks . Meryl Rosen , the program director , also assures that calls are welcome . Good luck . <p> Dr. Gridlock appears in this section each Thursday to explore local transportation matters . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being done about them .
