Gil Garcetti , the Los Angeles district attorney with the deep tan and the chiseled face , is widely perceived to have micromanaged all the major moves in the Simpson case , from the early decision to file the charges in downtown Los Angeles rather than nearby Santa Monica , thus ensuring a mostly minority jury , to the decision not to seek the death penalty . It 's a perception he denies , lavishly praising his prosecutors ' strategic calls . But in an interview with Time late Friday , Garcetti took full responsibility for the state 's presentation : " I ca n't promise the results of a case . I can promise you 'll be proud of the prosecutorial effort . And I 've delivered on that promise . " <P> Sources in the D.A . ' s office say that having a racially mixed jury was important to Garcetti , politically and morally , in the aftermath of the 1992 Rodney King verdict that led to the L.A. riots , in which thousands were injured and entire neighborhoods were destroyed . Garcetti will say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . There is a perception in minority communities that people of color are treated more harshly . If a racially mixed jury goes back to the community and says , ' Hey , we had an obligation to follow the evidence and the law . We had to , and the evidence was overwhelming , ' I think it will go a long way to restoring confidence in our criminal-justice system . " At the same time , Garcetti agrees that race can be a factor in jury deliberations . He cites a recent murder case in which one black juror held out , saying he would not send another black man to prison . The other jurors eventually brought him around . <P> Garcetti will not concede that opening the case on domestic violence may have undercut the impact of later evidence . " I 've been analogizing where we are today on domestic violence to where we were 15 years ago on driving under the influence of alcohol . That behavior was tolerated back then just as domestic violence is too often tolerated today . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this issue . It was relevant . ' ' Garcetti acknowledges the criticism , about the vast resources poured into the Simpson case . " How can you justify 13 full-time prosecutors on Simpson when you are prosecuting 70,000 other cases ? It 's a good question , ' ' he says . " But we were forced to put 13 on this case . We had 90 days to get to trial . " <P> He is worried , though , that the media scrutiny of Marcia Clark and her team may scare prosecutors off other high-profile cases . " We expected a magazine profile or two , but do you expect to see topless photos from an ex-mother-in-law ? " he says , referring to a tabloid story about Clark . " Most people who work for this office are not making a lot of money . They have the luxury of doing the right thing . They may think from now on , ' Sure , I 'd like to test myself on this big case , but it 's not worth it to myself or my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
