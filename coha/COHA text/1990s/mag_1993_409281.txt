Walking through the astronomical observatory at Jaipur , one of five built in northern India by Maharajah Sawai Jai Singh II almost three centuries ago , I felt an odd sensation , one I had never felt before . The stone was cold on my bare feet ; the low , early morning sun had not yet warmed the earth . In the dawn light , the enormous structures surrounding me were little more than silhouettes anchored deep in the earth . When the shade lifted , shafts of light raced across the ground . Staccato rhythms of light and dark covered the surface of the structures that encircled me . As I climbed their winding steps , penetrated their dark recesses , and passed beneath their empty portals , the sun seemed to bring them to life . Built to observe the heavens , these structures are now counted among the world 's great works of architecture and are regarded as one of the highest achievements of Indian astronomy . Jai Singh 's observatories resemble nothing in our ordinary experience . Few people , apart from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they work . Considering his accomplishments in astronomy , their builder , Jai Singh , is equally obscure . In modern observatories , such as those perched atop Mauna Loa in Hawaii , the buildings house instruments for observing the sky . In Jai Singh 's observatories , however , the buildings are the instruments . He erected his largest observatory in Jaipur , the capital he built and named after himself , and located the others in Delhi , Varanasi , Ujjain , and Mathura . In appearance , they are geometric hybrids . Familiar shapes  --  hemispheres , arcs , sections of cylinders , and fragments of cubes and isosceles triangles  --  have been subtly recombined to make new forms , some of the most beautiful I have seen . In all , Jai Singh constructed three dozen instruments , each designed for making specific astronomical measurements . These observatories had their origins in 1719 , when Jai Singh , then thirty-three years old , approached the Mogul emperor Muhammad Shah with a proposal to build them . Although the Moguls , who were Muslims , had ultimate control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were under the hereditary rule of Hindus such as Jai Singh . A contemporary portrait of Jai Singh shows him in a reflective mood , dressed in a brilliant aquamarine robe and a scarlet turban . His features and adornments reflect his Rajput caste : a straight , narrow nose , eyes shaped like almonds , jeweled earrings , and an ample mustache . In time he would govern much of northern India , including such ancient centers of learning as Agra , Varanasi , and Ujjain . In addition , he was building a reputation as a brilliant soldier and a clever statesman . He would establish himself as the most enlightened of despots , a patron of the arts and architecture , and a scholar . Chief among his scholarly passions were the mathematical sciences and astronomy . The need for the observatories , Jai Singh told the emperor , was immediate , as the astronomical tables used to plan the " very important affairs regarding religion and the administration of the empire " were far from accurate . The astronomers in Muhammad Shah 's court , who tracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disparities between the two different systems of timekeeping then in use , the lunar and solar calendars . The calendar favored by the emperor  --  called the hegira because it originated at the time of the Prophet Muhammad 's flight from Mecca in A.D. 622  --  was based on the period of the moon 's orbit around the earth . The calendar followed by the emperor 's Hindu subjects , however , was the vikramasamvat , which dated to 58 B.C. and was based on the period of the apparent revolution of the sun around the earth ( Jai Singh , like the emperor and his subjects , believed that the sun orbited the earth ) . In converting from one system to the other , there were always days , hours , and minutes left over . ( We still use leap years and unequal months to resolve this inconsistency . ) Keeping an accurate calendar was essential to the practice of religious rites and duties associated with the motions of heavenly bodies . Despite their different religions , Muhammad Shah and Jai Singh attached great importance to the rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon , the passage of the seasons , and events that were considered particularly ominous , such as lunar and solar eclipses . Like most of their subjects , both men believed that the entire course of people 's lives could be predicted from the configuration of the celestial bodies at the time of their birth  --  assuming , of course , that the astronomical tables were correct . Science and mythology mingled as easily in India as they did in Europe , where astrology still flourished despite the discoveries of Copernicus , Kepler , and Galileo . A second essential function of the astronomical tables was the timing of civil affairs . One particular challenge the emperor faced was how to administer the Moguls ' enormous tax system . Land revenues were traditionally collected after the harvest , when there was food to be taken , and since the harvest was a seasonal event , its timing had to be determined using the solar calendar . Jai Singh pointed out to the emperor that , based on his own observations , the official tables failed to predict with sufficient accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the moon 's rotation around the earth when the side of the moon facing the earth is completely dark . Even a slight error in this computation would be enough to throw off the lunar system of timekeeping . If the two calendars could not be reconciled , the orderly collection of revenues and other affairs of state would be jeopardized . With the flaws in his astronomical charts exposed , the emperor consented to Jai Singh 's plan to correct the situation . Perhaps the urgency of the request was enough to persuade the emperor , or perhaps the opportunity to name a new calendar era after himself prompted the decision ; all we know for certain is that the year 1097 of the Muslim calendar was henceforth to be known as the first year of the reign of Emperor Muhammad Shah  --  and the year in which construction of India 's first astronomical observatory was begun . Jai Singh began by reviewing the astronomical sources that had been used to assemble the tables of Muhammad Shah . He consulted Hindu tables that dated back to the ancient Vedas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand years before Christ ) . He examined Islamic tables that were based on the work of the Greek astronomers Hipparchus and Ptolemy . He even ordered a Sanskrit translation of Ptolemy 's Almagest ( the original was in Greek , but it had come down to him in Arabic ) . Jai Singh sent his emissaries to the centers of Islamic scholarship to bring back the most accurate astronomical instruments they could find . The devices that Greek , Islamic , and European astronomers had used to observe the heavens were similar to those used at sea for navigation : sundials , sextants , astrolabes , and armillary spheres . Extraordinarily crafted , with the intricacy of a Persian miniature , most of these instruments were small enough to be held by hand ; the few larger ones , like the nineteen-foot quadrant designed by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe , were mounted on platforms and pivots . Jai Singh studied these instruments in detail and had his artisans replicate them for his own use . Next , Jai Singh turned his attention to the newest European research in astronomy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on observations from such trustworthy sources as Brahe and the new observatory in Greenwich , England . One day , one of his emissaries , the Portuguese Jesuit Padre Manuel de Figueiredo , returned with a telescope , the curious device that Galileo had trained on the heavens to make all sorts of astounding discoveries in the early 1600s . It was not the first one to reach India , but Jai Singh became the first Indian to use a telescope for astronomical purposes . With it , he duplicated Galileo 's observations . He saw that Jupiter has four large moons ; that the sun has spots that rotate around its surface ; that Venus and Mercury have phases just like the moon 's , meaning that they too receive their light from the sun ; that Saturn has an odd , elliptical appearance ( he did not know that it was caused by rings ) ; that the orbits of the moon and sun around the earth ( really , the orbit of the earth around the sun ) are not circles , but ellipses ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with differing velocities , thus confirming a phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes . Perhaps most important for his own purposes , Jai Singh was able to observe the new moon 's first rays even when they were not visible to the naked eye , enabling him to establish a new standard of precision for the emperor 's new calendar . Fond as he was of his brass instruments , Jai Singh remained dissatisfied . He blamed the inaccuracies in the existing astronomical tables on the instruments ' mechanical limitations , noting in particular " the smallness of their size , the want of division into minutes , the shaking and wearing of their axes , the displacement of the centers of the circles , and the shifting of the planes . " In his studies of the old texts , Jai Singh had come across descriptions of giant stone instruments ( one was alleged to be as tall as the dome of Hagia Sophia , in Constantinople ) that the fifteenth-century Turkish ruler Ulugh Beg had constructed at Samarkand . And so , midway through the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were many advantages to making the instruments large . On a garden sundial , the shadow of the triangle falls on markings , etched into the base , that indicate the hour of day . Jai Singh 's largest sundial , which he called the Samrat Yantra , or " Great Instrument , " has a stone triangle nearly 90 feet tall and 150 feet long . As the sun arcs across the sky , the giant triangle casts a shadow on one of the two marble quadrants rising from its sides . Because of the instrument 's enormous size , the shadow moves at the rapid pace of about two millimeters a second . This means that the Samrat Yantra can measure the time of day to within two seconds . The Samrat Yantra is the largest and perhaps the simplest of the instruments , but the same principle , enormous scale , is basic to all of Jai Singh 's designs . Many , including the sundial , are original inventions of Jai Singh and his chief astronomer , Jagannath . Others are enlargements of the brass instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many observatories is not known with certainty . The Jaipur observatory , the largest and most varied of the five , has fourteen instruments , followed by the one in Delhi , which has ten . The others contain a half dozen or less , and most of these duplicate the ones at Jaipur or Delhi . Perhaps Jai Singh wanted the increased accuracy that comes from taking measurements from several different points or perhaps he was simply experimenting , hoping for improvements with each new instrument . The Jaipur observatory , for instance , has two Samrat Yantras , and the smaller one preceded the construction of the one that is exactly ten times its size . Jai Singh employed so many types of instruments because two different coordinate systems are needed to keep track of motions in the sky . The first is centered on the observer and measures the position of a heavenly body as seen by the observer against the sky . To locate the precise position of an object in this system , the information needed is the object 's altitude , its height above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and its azimuth , or compass direction . But because of the earth 's continuous rotation and its revolution around the sun , measurements based on the observer are good only for the instant in which they are made : in the succeeding moment , the motion of the earth has rendered them out of date . A second measuring system is needed , one with fixed coordinates in the sky . In this system , an imaginary " celestial sphere " with the stars painted on its surface surrounds the earth . Its coordinates are an extension of the earth 's . The pole of the earth pierces the celestial sphere at the celestial pole , and the earth 's latitude and longitude lines are projected outward onto the sphere 's surface , where they are called declination and right ascension . The observer 's system can only be convened to the system based on the celestial sphere by knowing the position of the observer on the earth and the precise time of the measurement . Even then , the process of conversion is extremely time consuming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometry . Jai Singh realized that by incorporating the conversion calculations into the design of the instruments , his astronomers could bypass the need for repeated hand calculations . The design of the instruments was determined not only by celestial but also by mundane considerations . For example , the arched openings in the Samrat Yantra prevent it from toppling over in strong winds . The instruments also had to be built to a human scale , so observers could take measurements . The Samrat Yantra has steps on both the quadrants and the hypotenuse of the central triangle that allow the observers to reach the stone railings on which the markings are etched . Mundane considerations also explain the form of the Jai Prakash Yantra ( Jai Singh 's Instrument of Light ) , which consists of two complementary components that must be used together . Two hemispherical bowls are set into the ground , side by side . Each represents the inverted hemisphere of the sky with coordinate lines inscribed in the marble surface . Stretched across the top of each bowl are two crosswires from which a central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sighted through the ring , the position of the observer 's eye held close to the surface of the bowl determines the object 's coordinates in the sky . Two complementary bowls are necessary because in a completely smooth , intact bowl an observer could not get into a comfortable position to make precise recordings . The surface of each bowl is therefore broken up by channels that function as walkways ; the channels in one bowl correspond to the intact portion of the other bowl . If the line of sight falls upon an intact surface , the observer can lean over it and take a precise reading of the coordinates . ( A pointer or a hollow tube can also be used to improve the accuracy of the reading . ) If the line of sight happens to fall into one of the channels where there are no coordinates , the observer simply crosses to the next bowl , where the line of sight will of necessity fall on an intact surface . In Delhi , the Ram Yantra ( Ram 's Instrument , named after a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this case two enormous cylinders , and is used to measure the position of stars and planets . Each is walled by thirty thick columns alternating with thirty sets of arched openings . At the center of each cylinder is an enormous stone peg . Radiating from the base of each peg , like slices of cake , are thirty triangular sectors of stone alternating with thirty open walkways of the same shape . Each stone sector , like each arched opening in the wall , thus measures 6deg of arc . The sectors are further subdivided into minutes of arc by markings on their surface , while notches in the wall next to the openings can hold measured metal bars . To take readings , the observer stands against the central column and notes the position of a celestial object , the openings in the wall revealing its altitude and the stone sectors its azimuth . As with the Jai Prakash Yantra , if a line of sight is blocked by a column in the wall , or if it falls on a walkway instead of a marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jai Singh needed to know the time of day in other parts of the world , particularly in those places where the astronomical tables he was relying on were compiled . Of course , he could calculate this information by knowing the time of day at one of his own observatories and the difference in longitude between the foreign location and his own observatory , but he preferred to construct a device that would give him the information instantaneously . For this purpose , he created the Misra Yantra ( Composite Instrument ) , at first appearance the oddest and most complex of all his devices . ( It may have been constructed by his son after Jai Singh 's death . ) With its vertical triangle and curved quadrants , it duplicates the Samrat Yantra , but less precisely . Unique to the Misra Yantra , however , are two pairs of semicircular arcs on either side of the central staircase . Each arc lies in the meridian ( a vertical plane passing in the north-south direction through the observer ) of a different foreign observatory : the well-known Greenwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , one supposedly located in a village in Japan and the other on an island in the Pacific . To operate this instrument , one observes the shadow cast on each of the four arcs by a metal peg at the center . ( Because the two pairs of arcs have different centers , two pegs are required , one on either side of the stair . ) When the sun rises , it casts the shadow of the peg on the two western arcs ; when it sets , the peg 's shadow falls on the eastern arcs . Markings on the arcs indicate the declination , the angular height above the celestial equator , of the sun for each foreign location . At a different time of day for each observatory , the shadow of the peg indicates that the sun has reached its maximum declination , or noon . allowing any other time of day to be deduced . One of the greatest challenges faced by astronomers before Jai Singh was how to determine the coordinates of an object on the celestial sphere directly , without converting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilts with respect to its orbit around the sun , the sun 's apparent orbit around the earth , called the ecliptic , inclines to the earth 's equator at an angle of a little more than 23deg . At any given time of day or night , one can align the hypotenuse of a triangle with the pole of the ecliptic , just as the hypotenuse of the Samrat Yantra 's stone triangle aligns with the pole of the earth . But whereas the direction of the earth 's pole remains constant , the direction of the pole of the ecliptic is continually on the move , its apparent movement caused by the earth 's rotation . As a result , a single fixed instrument is incapable of making continuous direct measurements on the celestial sphere . Jai Singh 's ingenious solution was to devise the Rashivalayas Yantra ( Divisions of the Zodiac Instrument ) . This one instrument consists of twelve separate structures , one for each of the zodiacal signs . The zodiacal signs are the twelve constellations that fall along the ecliptic , dividing its circumference into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full circumference in twenty-four hours , a new zodiacal sign comes upon the local meridian every two hours . Although each of the Rashivalayas devices superficially resembles the Samrat Yantra , there is a crucial difference . Whereas the hypotenuse and quadrants of the Samrat Yantra are based on the coordinate system of the observer , the hypotenuse and quadrants of the Rashivalayas are oriented with respect to the celestial sphere . Each of the Rashivalayas devices points in a slightly different direction and is designed to be used during a different two-hour period of the day . When a given zodiacal sign falls along the local meridian , it is a signal that the hypotenuse of the corresponding Rashivalayas aligns with the pole of the ecliptic at exactly that moment . Observations must be made within a minute or two , before the time of alignment passes . By comparing measurements taken at two-hour intervals and interpolating , it is possible to track the movements of the planets on the celestial sphere . By 1737 , eighteen years after he had begun , Jai Singh 's work was virtually complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the " Astronomical Tables of Muhammad Shah . " Two years after he dedicated this work to the emperor , however , Delhi was sacked and plundered and Muhammad Shah dethroned . The plunderer carried off all of Jai Singh 's brass instruments ; only their enormous size saved the stone ones . Having survived one attack , the stone instruments were subjected to another , stronger assault , from a different quarter . In 1730 , one of Jai Singh 's emissaries had returned from Europe with a book that had been published just five years earlier , Johan Raptist Hoemann 's Great Atlas of the Whole World . This book contained a curious chart showing the sun , instead of the earth , at the center of the universe . Before long , other reports began to reach Jai Singh of this new Copernican model and of the three laws of planetary motion contributed by Johannes Kepler , ideas that were gaining wide acceptance in Europe . Faced with a compelling theory that directly contradicted his own , Jai Singh went with the theory that lay closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own theory Kepler 's first law ( that the planetary orbits are ellipses , not circles ) , he never gave up believing that the earth is at the center . When he died in 1743 , at the age of fifty-seven , he could not have known that he chose wrongly . Jai Singh 's failure to accept the heliocentric model spelled the demise of stone instruments as useful tools for astronomical observation . In a cruel irony , an inaccurate instrument can not detect the subtle differences in the planetary movements that mark the geocentric theory as incorrect ; only instruments of the caliber of Jai Singh 's could show that their manufacturer 's vision of the universe was wrong . While other astronomers learned to adjust for the new theories by rebuilding or recalibrating their metal instruments , the giant stone instruments that had once been the best in the world became obsolete . The centuries have taken their toll on Jai Singh 's observatories . Many of the existing instruments are missing the metal pins and crosswires they need to function , while the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jaipur has distorted their curvature , rendering some of the measurements inaccurate . The observatory at Mathura has disappeared completely , the victim of plunder or the ravages of time . Today the observatories also face a different and more insidious danger : becoming a cultural cliche . Contemporary Indian architects often echo the curves of Jai Singh 's instruments in concrete , but they lack the purpose , craftsmanship , sense of proportion , and spiritual underpinnings of the originals . A caricatured image of the Misra Yantra was the official symbol of the 1982 Asian Games held in Delhi , appearing on banners , posters , and coins . And while the symbol of the observatories is held high , the buildings themselves continue to disintegrate or are being destroyed . In their rush to prepare for the Asian Games , government workers trying to keep water from collecting at the base of the Samrat Yantra poured concrete around it , submerging a portion of the two quadrants , perhaps forever . <p>                @ @ @ @ @
