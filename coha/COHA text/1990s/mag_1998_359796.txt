Eddie Murphy  --  bald , blissful and guileless  --  is top-billed in this clever , derivative comedy ( think The Truman Show with lower ratings ) about a wandering shaman who stumbles into fame on a home shopping network . But the real star is Jeff Goldblum as the network 's frazzled manager . With his lupine smile and fake-intimate voice , he pushes a line of patter that is just a bit too slick to pass for charm . And when his life starts crumbling , you can almost smell his comic flop sweat through the screen . Tom Schulman 's script is smart about the media 's ability to create celebrities  --  and the viewer 's need to embrace them  --  until it goes soft-hearted and - headed by denouncing the very salesmanship that Hollywood and TV are built on . For an hour or so , though , the film has the gaudy assurance of a Ginsu knife infomercial . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
