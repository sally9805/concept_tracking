<p> When the Stanford football coaches evaluated their defense before this season , they felt especially good about their starting strong safety , 19-year-old Leon Vickers . <p> He had played sparingly in 1993 as a freshman , but proved he was a hard hitter . His teammates considered him one of the most vicious tacklers on the squad . <p> But Vickers has n't played a single game for Stanford this season . He left school to continue his involvement in a religious sect , and his mother , Nancy Vickers , claims that Leon is a victim of mind control . <p> His membership in the religious group began during his senior year at Rancho Alamitos High School in Garden Grove ( Orange County ) , where he starred as a running back and linebacker . One night , a girlfriend invited Vickers to a Bible- study class at a local church called Church of Christ . The church did n't actually have a church building . Its members met in various places . A friend says Vickers told him it even met for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rents space in an office building in Garden Grove . It believes in a strict interpretation of the Bible and is associated with about 35 other congregations around the country . It is not connected with the more mainstream Churches of Christ or the United Church of Christ . <p> Vickers enjoyed the Bible study and continued to attend on a weekly basis . At first , Nancy Vickers , who works in the cafeteria at Rancho Alamitos High , and her husband , James , who 's retired from the Air Force and now works as a security guard , were n't troubled by their son 's attendance at church . Leon had always had a religious bent , and he was able to balance his commitments to school , football and the church . But after a while the church began to demand more of his time . <p> Nancy Vickers was delighted when her son was accepted at Stanford . She felt that when he went away to school " he would n't have any of this ( church activity ) . " What she did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vallejo . Pretty soon , the Church of Christ was sending a car down to the Stanford campus to pick up her son and take him to Vallejo for religious study . <p> Vickers ' religious pursuits began to interfere with football practice , but coach Bill Walsh tried to be understanding . He said Vickers could leave practice 45 minutes early one day a week to attend his church classes . <p> But one night a week was n't enough . The church began to require more and more of Vickers ' time , and Walsh became worried . <p> " The final demand Leon made , " Walsh said , " was that he would n't practice Monday , Tuesday , Thursday or Sunday . He would play in the games , but he would n't be with the team the night before . " <p> PLAYED LIKE A DRUM <p> Of the church , Walsh said , " Whoever was working with him just played him like a drum . I think they put him through a test of commitments . He would be with them four nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I finally invited his pastor to observe a practice . I hate to use that word . It 's an insult to pastors . He would never come . And football was only a part of it . More important was what Leon was losing as a student at Stanford . " <p> So Walsh talked directly to Vickers . " As soon as I 'd start talking in an inquiring way about religion , he 'd get a strange look on his face and stare into space , " Walsh said . " He 'd tune out . I said , ' Leon , what if you have to work nights , can you be excused from meetings ? ' He said , ' No . ' I said , ' What if you 're a fireman and there 's a fire when it 's time to go to services ? ' Leon said , ' I 'd have to go to services . ' <p> " This man was a captive . He could not do anything that interfered with his church . " <p> Last summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to Stanford . They asked Walsh for help . Walsh told Vickers he could leave practice 45 minutes early two nights a week . That still was n't enough . <p> HE WOULD N'T BUDGE <p> Walsh had several of Vickers ' teammates phone him , and he also told assistant coaches to call . Vickers would n't change his mind . <p> The Chronicle tried unsuccessfully to reach him for comment for this article . One member of his church in Garden Grove explained Vickers ' unwillingness to be interviewed . " Leon has gone through an awful lot . Why does he have to be subjected to more ? " <p> Recently , however , he was interviewed by the Los Angeles Times . When the church objected to the interview , Vickers wanted the article killed , but the Times refused . When a photographer for that newspaper tried to get a picture of him , Vickers ran away . <p> In the interview , he said , " I started realizing how much of the Bible I do need . It takes work to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , the more filthiness I can get out . " <p> Trying to explain his decision to quit football , he said , " I did n't want to give half of myself to God . When I watch Stanford on TV , sometimes I wish that could be me . But I know I 'm doing the right thing . I do n't regret it . " <p> LOSING HER SON <p> Nancy Vickers regrets it . Since Leon quit Stanford , she 's had trouble eating and sleeping and feels she 's " losing " her son . He still lives at home , and that gives her some relief , knowing she can keep an eye on him . But he 's given up Stanford for a job at a plant that manufactures screws and bolts for helicopters and airplanes . He earns $ 6.50 an hour . Most nights he goes to church meetings . <p> " It 's mind control , " Nancy Vickers says of her son 's church . " It 's on the line of a cult . I attended Bible studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were saying . They were like Nazis . It was a big brainwash scheme . They put down every church but theirs . No one else could get to heaven . " <p> Priscilla Coates , chairwoman of the Los Angeles affiliate of a preventive and educational group called Cult Awareness , is reluctant to use the word " cult " to describe the branch of Church of Christ to which Vickers belongs . She prefers the term " unsafe group . " <p> " Someone gets a $ 100,000 scholarship to Stanford , and they 're going to make him give it up , " she says . " Is that a safe group ? No way . If the group is unsafe , they maintain some type of elitism . Only through them you can get to heaven . Anyone not in the church is tainted and should not be associated with . " <p> ' NOT A LITTLE FOLLOWER ' <p> Kim Smith , a member of the church , is amused by Coates ' characterization of Church of Christ as an unsafe group . " What amazes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledges Leon is intelligent and inquisitive , yet when it comes to his religion , this 210-pound man is ' brainwashed with Nazi tactics . ' That 's incomprehensible . He 's not a little follower . He simply came to Bible class and continued to come . " <p> On Vickers ' giving up his scholarship , Smith says , " We 've become such a materialistic society . Twenty years ago , if Leon went to the seminary it would be praiseworthy , but now money always always supersedes good in our society . He made his own choice . " <p> Mark Miller , Vickers ' high school football coach and algebra teacher , describes Vickers as " a nice , respectful young man " who was always at school early to ask Miller questions about the math homework . Miller recently talked to Vickers for four hours , trying to persuade him to return to Stanford . " I did n't want Leon , five years from now , to say , ' Why did n't they tell me I was doing the wrong thing ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Leon is very committed to things , " Miller says . " His whole life dream was to play in the NFL and get a degree from a good school . How can it be that he had a dream since he was a little kid and now he does n't have it anymore ? It 's like his life is over . He 's completely given over this life for the next one . He 's been given great gifts , a great personality , and he 's not using them . It 's a tragedy . I call ( his church ) a cult . This is a bad group . " <p> SURPRISING APOLOGIES <p> Miller was alarmed when he was told by some of Vickers ' friends and teammates that they had received notes of apology from him for trivial things they did n't even remember he had done . To Miller , this was another sign that Vickers was almost saying farewell to this life . <p> Jeff Byrd , another Stanford player , read one of the apology letters . It was addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swear word during a ride in a car . Neither Byrd nor the friend remembered him saying the word . <p> Next to Vickers ' family , Byrd misses Vickers the most . He and Vickers were best friends in high school , even though they competed to be starting tailback on the football team . When they graduated , Byrd went to Columbia , but he and Vickers would talk on the phone several nights a week . The conversations mostly involved Vickers praising Stanford and telling Byrd to transfer because he was good enough to compete in the Pac-10 . " We 'll play together again , " Vickers told him . <p> Inspired by the urgings of his friend , Byrd transferred . He is a reserve running back , a walk-on , who does n't have a scholarship . He came to Stanford for the education , but also to be with Vickers . Three weeks after Byrd was accepted to Stanford last spring , Vickers told him he 'd be leaving . <p> FOCUSING ON CHURCH <p> Byrd is trying to make sense of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those people who 's very easily manipulated , " he said , " but he 's also very focused . Whatever he focuses on , he gets . Now he 's focusing on church . " <p> Byrd is reluctant to say Vickers is making a mistake . He refuses to judge Vickers ' life , but he 's aware his friend has changed . " He 's quoted scripture to me , " Byrd said . " It 's odd . I just had to sit <p> Nancy Vickers asked Byrd to talk to her son , but Leon did n't want to hear . Vickers told him , " Jeff , I ca n't just go to church on Sundays and put God off the other days . " <p> " I just hope Leon does n't in five years look back on his life and feel disappointed because he left a great education and a great football program , " Byrd says . " I hope it works out for him . It 's sad . It 's terrible from my point of view . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vickers back on the team . " I 'd have to visit with him at length and feel satisfied he was making a long-term commitment , " Walsh said . " If I felt he was , he 'd be welcomed back . "
