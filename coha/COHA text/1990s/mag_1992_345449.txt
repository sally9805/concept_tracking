When violence erupts in the occupied territories , asking who started it rarely serves a useful purpose . More pertinent is what new hatreds have been etched in blood , and will kindle new violence . <P> Take the Palestinian attack two weeks ago on a bus bound from Jerusalem to the West Bank Jewish settlement of Shiloh . Dov Weiner , 11 , was returning home from therapy for a gunshot wound in his shoulder sustained during an October bus attack . In the gunfire on Jan. 14 , the boy was hit again , this time in the leg . Later that night , Jewish men drove to the home of Riad Malki , a Palestinian hard-liner , pelted the house with stones , broke several windows and spray-painted Stars of David on all the entrances . Although Malki 's house is under Israeli surveillance , the army did not intervene . Neither did the Israeli police , who waited until morning to answer Malki 's call for help . <P> The spiraling violence between Jewish settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank reflects how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond political abstraction : it is an issue that cuts to the very dignity and survival of both Arabs and Jews . For them , the looming battle between Jerusalem and Washington over $10 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Israel to help settle Soviet Jewish immigrants is a symbol not only of where the Bush Administration 's sympathies lie but also of what the occupied territories ' future is likely to be . <P> If the diplomatic tussle lives up to pre-bout rhetoric , either the U.S.-Israeli friendship or the Middle East peace process could suffer a knockdown . Last September the Bush Administration hinted strongly that the loan guarantees might be linked to limits on settlement construction . President Bush has not budged since . Last week Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir answered by pledging to keep building , declaring that " no power in the world can prevent us from carrying on . " In response , the Palestinian delegation to the U.S.-sponsored peace talks threatened to boycott the negotiations if the guarantees were granted unconditionally . <P> Small wonder that some U.S. analysts see a bruising battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-election this year , and neither relishes the prospect of a fight with an ally who can sway domestic voters from afar . Members of Congress , who must approve the guarantees , know they will suffer electoral consequences if the decision pits their loyalty to Israel against their commitment to the peace process . So in Washington , if not in the Middle East , compromise appears to be at hand . <P> There may have been a step in that direction in a meeting last Friday between Secretary of State James Baker and Zalman Shoval , Israel 's ambassador to the U.S. Baker reportedly proposed to condition the loan guarantees on Israel 's agreement not to begin any new construction in the territories . Officials in Washington refused to confirm the reports , insisting that the Baker-Shoval meeting was just the first of a series and that no deal was likely for at least another month .
