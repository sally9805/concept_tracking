<p> When Americans think of Barcelona , most think of the sea , the ' 92 Olympics or the singular architecture of Gaud . They probably do n't think of onions . But every year , for a few months beginning at the end of January , the Catalan people of Spain , especially from Barcelona and Tarragona , farther down the Balearic coast , think only of flocking to the countryside to indulge in a feast centered on calcots , specially grown green onions grilled over vines . <p> The rituals of the calcotada , as the whole feast is called , are established and , like everything in Catalunya ( as the Catalans call their Catalonia region ) , little publicized . Everyone just knows where to go and what to do , from donning a bib to peel the charred calcots before plunging them into the garlicky romesco sauce , to the drinking of wine from the porro , a traditional spouted glass vessel that requires great aim to avoid the disgrace of drips , to the obligatory walk afterward . <p> Knowing what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tucking into a calcotada . Whether you are at a private calcotada or enjoying one with a group in a restaurant , you do n't have to choose what to eat  --  the menu is fairly standard , and the host or restaurant takes over with personal variations . And , as with anything to do with food , people are certain that their way is best . <p> Calcots are , of course , the basis of the calcotada . They resemble particularly plump green onions , but their production is as complicated as that of asparagus and endive . Though devotees of calcotadas , city-dwelling Barcelona friends have been somewhat vague in helping me to discover the origins of the feast or the specifics of the onions themselves . Colman Andrews , in his excellent book " Catalan Cuisine " ( Atheneum , 1988 ) , clearly has n't been able to nail down the origins either , but he gives a fine description of the onions . They take , he notes , about a year and a half to grow , starting with seed onions planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprouted , about two months later . After they are harvested some 10 months later , in June or July , they are stored in a dry place until they germinate again . Then , almost a year after they were first planted , they 're trimmed and replanted in trenches where , as they grow , they are buried so that the new growth is blanched . When they are finally harvested in January after several months of second growth , they are bigger , sweeter and milder than ordinary scallions or green onions , all because of the calcat or " shoe " of dirt they have worn during their second growth period . Hence the name calcots . <p> Many large calcotadas begin outside , with everyone standing around the calcots , which , fresh from their cooking and resting , are often presented on terra cotta tiles to help keep them warm . The almond-flavored garlicky sauce , already on the table , is made from recipes that call for a " fistful " of ground roasted almonds and hazelnuts and a " few " roasted garlic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little hot pepper ( Catalan cuisine is not piquant or spicy ) . <p> But , like the growing process , preparation of the calcots requires more than one step . First they are grilled over a roaring fire , ideally made with vines . Then they rest and steam in a wrapping of newspaper , which makes the inside portion under the blackened outer layer tender . Only then are they ready to eat . <p> And what a process that is . Attacking the calcots is satisfyingly messy . Holding the root end of the blackened calcot in one hand , you grasp the light green inner shoots with the other . As you pull , the glistening tender center slips smoothly out . Then , dipping it in the deliciously nutty , garlicky romesco sauce , you lift your chin proudly and slurp it in the way your mother told you it was impolite to eat asparagus . <p> You repeat the process again and again , conversing over the deliciousness and the general indigestibility of the combination of onions and the sauce , until everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard procedure , you ca n't help but end up with soot all over your hands and face , which provides another immediate and recurrent topic of conversation . <p> An American who lives in Barcelona told me that when she went to her first calcotada , she ordered coffee after the calcots , thinking , quite reasonably , that there could n't be more . But of course there is  --  much more . After everyone retreats to the bathroom to wash off as much soot as possible , the main meal begins at freshly set tables , with mongetes and botifarra , white beans and grilled blood sausage , accompanied by carxofes , grilled artichokes and allioli or garlic mayonnaise . ( With this dish , you reiterate your fervent thanks that everyone with you in the car back to Barcelona will have eaten the same breathtaking amount of garlic you have . ) <p> After polishing off this course , the main course arrives  --  a mixed grill of white botifarra and different cuts of lamb . At some point , cava , the delicious Spanish sparkling wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Champagne ! ) , appears as a supplement to the red wine everyone has been pouring down their throats from the porro , the spouted glass beaker . As you might expect , hilarity increases as the afternoon progresses and the pace of eating slows . The dessert can vary  --  either pudding or the traditional crema catalana , whose wonderfully burnt-sugar top comes not from putting it under a broiler but from laying a poker-hot salamander on top of the crema just before it is served . Sometimes before the main dessert there is a brief presentation of dried fruits and nuts . <p> This is a Catalan custom , not a Spanish one . Catalunya , a region of Europe including the northeastern corner of Spain , Andorra and French Roussillon , is fiercely proud of its history and culture , and , since the death of Generalisimo Francisco Franco in 1975 , Catalan has assumed an equal role with Castellano , or Castilian Spanish , as the languages of official life in Barcelona and many other parts of Catalunya . Franco 's attempt to destroy Catalan culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Franco would taunt Catalans , saying , " Si eres espan ol , habla cristiano ! "  --  if you are Spanish , speak like a Christian , meaning a regular person . ) <p> Though the public use of Catalan disappeared during the 40 years of Franco 's dictatorship , people continued to speak it with their families and friends , and , with his death , both language and culture came roaring back into public prominence . Now , official notices , program notes for concerts at the Palau de la Musica and instruction in the early grades of primary school are all in Catalan , though , as I have discovered , it is entirely possible to live happily in Barcelona knowing Castellano and only the rudiments of Catalan , the rudiments including , of course , the names of all the interesting dishes you want to order in restaurants . <p> Catalans tell a joke that reveals both their sense of their own importance and their awareness that no one else knows much about them or their importance ( you may have heard it used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's the joke : A group of Catalans is traveling in China , and one of them , trying to explain to a Chinese person where and what Catalunya is , says , " We 're Catalan . There are 6 million of us . " To which the Chinese person replies , " Oh really ? In which hotel are you staying ? " <p> Well , the joke is really on that mythical Chinese person . Had he but listened to the tales the Catalan could tell , he might have learned about the calcotada . <p> Ellen Greenblatt teaches literature in Barcelona .
