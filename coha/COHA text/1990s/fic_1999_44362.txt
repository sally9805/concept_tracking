INTRODUCING : <p> KING CURLY-Q <p> QUEEN TITANIA <p> PETTYJOHN , the Prickly Prince <p> MISS NAGG , the private <p> NED <p> NELLY <p> BOOK CHARACTERS : <p> PETER PAN <p> CINDERELLA <p> ROBIN HOOD <p> TOM SAWYER <p> HANS BRINKER <p> JO MARCH <p> WHAT YOU SEE WHEN THE CURTAIN GOES UP : Here is a cozy-looking throne room that any palace should be proud of . Certainly King Curly-Q and Queen Titania and all the kingdom of the Fuss Budgets feel that it is simple and homelike with its couch and its rocking chair thrones decked out in purple bows and gold lace . Nearby is a royal footstool for the Prickly Prince and a low table upon which you will see a telephone , a dinner bell , and a bowl of flowers for decoration . <p> QUEEN TITANIA runs in panting just as the curtain goes up . She wears her gold crown sideways and a royal purple dress , of course , but she also wears a white apron over that and carries a feather duster that she whisks around briskly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but breaks off suddenly and rings the dinner bell , which in some way is connected to the telephone . Then she picks up the receiver . <p> QUEEN TITANIA ( sweetly ) : Hello . Hello . This is Queen Titania . Give me King Curly-Q 's room , please . ( impatiently ) Hello . That you , Curly ? Well , why are n't you here ? Where ? Here . In the throne room , of course , getting ready for your son 's birthday . Do you mean to say you 've forgotten Prince Pettyjohn has a birthday ? The idea ! What ? I said , the idea ! You 've lost your collar button ? Well , find it . And be sure you bring the presents , dear . WHAT ? I said BRING THE PRESENTS ! ( Hangs up the receiver with a jerk . ) Drat that man ! I do wish he was n't so good at forgettery . <p> She continues her song and her dusting , until the KING runs in , wearing a crown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laden with presents  --  drums , tops , airplane , horn , bow and arrows , watch , train of cars , and ship-none wrapped up . <p> KING CURLY-Q ( breathlessly ) : Here they are , my dear Titania . I do hope Pettyjohn will like them . <p> QUEEN TITANIA ( helping him stack them on the table ) So do I. But he is getting rather prickly and discontented lately . Is n't he ? I hear our subjects are beginning to call him the Prickly Prince . And they 're sort of fussbudgets themselves . <p> KING CURLY-Q Down into the royal dungeon goes the first one I hear calling our precious little Pettyjohn that . Prickly Prince , indeed ! <p> QUEEN TITANIA : Well , he is . Why ca n't Miss Nagg amuse him ? What 's the good of having a private wizardess for your son if she does n't ? <p> KING CURLY-Q : That reminds me . He rings bells and picks up receiver . Miss Nagg , please . Miss Nagg ? King Curly-Q speaking . We are waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please hurry . Hangs up receiver and turns darkly to Queen I 'll see that she amuses him this time . I 'll see that she does ! <p> QUEEN TITANIA ( turning from a mirror on the wall where she has been powdering her nose with a huge powder puff ) : How ? ( In a loud whisper ) Here 's Miss Nagg , now . <p> MISS NAGG enters from left , pulling a wagon filled with more toys . KING and QUEEN promptly sit down in their rocking chair thrones and put on huge spectacles . MISS NAGG holds up her hand to speak , just as though she were in school . They pay no attention to her . <p> MISS NAGG ( still waving her hand , but unable to keep silent another tick of the clock ) : If you please , your majesties-I 'm here ! <p> QUEEN TITANIA ( looking the other way ) : So you are . KING CURLY-Q ( staring straight ahead ) : Nothing new about that . <p> There is another silence . <p> MISS NAGG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presents-harmonica , camera , skates , football , tennis racket , puzzles , and <p> KING CURLY-Q Yes , yes . Yes , yes . Never mind naming them all . But if nothing amuses Pettyjohn today-out you go . <p> MISS NAGG : Wh-wh-wh-a-a-at , your ma-mamajesty ? <p> KING CURLY-Q ( darkly ) : Out you go-if you ca n't make the prince smile before sunset . Wizardess hat , wand , cape-all will be taken away from you . And the wizardess salary , too ! And you will have to be the thirdassistant scullery maid , instead . <p> MISS NAGG ( clasping her hands pleadingly ) : Not that , your majesty , not that ! Why , without my wizardess salary , my poor widowed mother would have to give up waffles and sausages . She would have to live on nothing but spinach and green tea ! Please , your majesty , do n't make me a third assistant scullery maid ! <p> KING CURLY-Q ( firmly ) : You heard me . Here comes Pettyjohn now . <p> The PRICKLY PRINCE enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sash , and a green suit . Also a frown-a big one . <p> QUEEN TITANIA ( holding out her arms ) : Darling ! <p> KING CURLY-Q ( holding out his , too ) : My son ! <p> PRICKLY PRINCE ( letting them kiss him but pulling away fretfully when they start to hug ) : Oh , for the love of mud , do n't be so goofy ! <p> QUEEN TITANIA ( wiping her eyes with her hanky ) : Do n't use such strong language , darling . <p> KING CURLY-Q ( glaring at MISS NAGG , who cringes ) : It 's the duty of a wizardess to keep you from inelegant speech . <p> PRICKLY PRINCE : Oh , for the love of mud ! Turns and sees presents . Are these my birthday presents ? Ho ! Hum ! He examines them one by one , occasionally with a look of mild disinterest . The others watch him eagerly , and sigh loudly when he frowns or shakes his head in disgust . After he handles them all , he sighs , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal footstool He whispers loudly to himself " Goofy-that 's what ! " <p> QUEEN TITA : Do n't you like your pretty toys , darling ? <p> PRICKLY PRINCE ( hiding a yawn ) : Fine . Thank you very much . <p> KING CURLY-Q : That drum and those puzzlespretty good-eh ? <p> PRICKLY PRINCE ( lifting his brows ) : Great . <p> MISS NAGG ( imploringly ) : Oh , your highness , please smile ! Why do n't you like your presents ? <p> PRICKLY PRINCE : They 're all right . But-why did n't you buy me something different , something that I 'll never get tired of , something that I could pal around with and laugh at and get sort of excited over ? I kind of thought you would . <p> QUEEN TITANIA : You 've had everything . That 's the trouble . Miss Nagg will have to find you something new . <p> KING CURLY-Q : That 's it , Miss Nagg , something new ! What 's the good of a wizard wand if you do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wand ) : I 'll try . But it is a bit warped , I 'm afraid . <p> A horn sounds off stage . <p> PRICKLY PRINCE ( getting up ) : There 's the breakfast horn . Ho ! Hum ! I 'm not hungry , but come on . <p> QUEEN TITANIA ( hoisting herself out of her throne with the aid of MISS NAGG and the KING ) : Lots of little boys like you would be thankful to have chicken croquettes and pancakes and syrup and blueberry muffins for breakfast . <p> KING CURLY-Q I 'm hungry and maybe you will be at the table . Let 's start . <p> They form a dignified procession , KING , QUEEN , and PRINCE , lifting each foot up primly and holding their chins very high . They go off at the left , leaving MISS NAGG alone . She begins to sniff . <p> MISS NAGG ( pressing a hanky to her eyes ) : Oh , dear . Oh , dear . Oh , dear . Oh , dear o ! Nothing but spinach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks sadly at her wand . I saw some children out walking in the royal woods this morning . They had lost their way . She blinks fast and sits up straighter . I 'll summon them here and maybe they can help me ! She shuts her eyes and waves her wand over her head in three circles . Abracadabra ! Cadoodle ! Cadoo ! She opens her eyes just as NED and NELLY run in from the right . They all smile shyly at each other . <p> NED : I beg your pardon . We must have come in here by mistake . I 'm Ned . <p> NELLY : I think I know the way home , though . I 'm Nelly . <p> MISS NAGG : I 'm Miss Nagg , the royal wizardess , and I sent for you to help me . <p> NED ( staring at her hand ) : I did n't know a wizardess needed helping . <p> NELLY ( stepping toward her ) : What could we do ? <p> MISS NAGG : Find some way of amusing Pettyjohn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't given something new that he can pal around with and laugh at and get sort of excited over and never get tired of-why , King Curly-Q is going to change me into a third assistant scullery maid . Her voice breaks and she wipes her eyes with her hanky . And-and-that means my poor widowed mother will have to live on green tea and spinach and never have waffles or sausage again-ever ! She bursts into loud boo-hoos and NELLY and NED both run over to comfort her . <p> NELLY ( patting her back ) : There , there , do n't cry . Perhaps we can think of something . <p> NED ( looking doubtful ) : Perhaps . They both seat themselves on the couch with MISS NAGG between them and think hard . <p> NELLY ( looking over at the toys ) : Are these the things that do n't amuse him ? My , those silver skates are dandy . They look like Hans Brinker 's . <p> NED : And the bow and arrows I bet are as good as Robin Hood 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? Friends of yours ? <p> NEY ( laughing ) : Book friends , you know . Surely , you 've read their books ? MISS NAGG shakes her head . You have n't ? <p> NED ( suddenly ) : Why , there is n't a single book among all those presents ! Does n't the Prickly Prince like books ? <p> MISS NAGG : He had a dictionary , of course , and a speller . And I have " Easy Lessons in Magic . " But I 've always thought other books were dull , so <p> NED and NELLY : Dull ! Dull ! Books dull ? <p> MISS NAGG ( doubtfully ) : Are n't they ? <p> NELLY : Books , the right kind of books , are never dull . They are your friends , your pals , that are always waiting to take you on wonderful adventures ! <p> NED : Books are fun . Lots of them make you laugh and laugh . And they 're exciting , too . <p> NELLY : Some are beautiful and thrilling . They make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-written and interesting and real ! <p> MISS NAGG ( clapping her hands ) : You 've got it ! Something new that he can pal around with and laugh at and get sort of excited over and never get tired ofbooks , that 's it ! <p> NED : Call him in and we 'll tell him about books . <p> NELLY : Yes , call him in ! <p> MISS NAGG ( starting to ring the big bell by the telephone and then stopping suddenly ) : No , that wo n't do . Your merely saying they are interesting and all that would n't prove they are . The Prickly Prince might just yawn and never even open a book to try it . <p> NELLY ( sitting down dejectedly ) : Too bad you ca n't make some of the characters step out of their books so he could see them for himself ! <p> NED : You 've got a magic wand , have n't you ? <p> MISS NAGG ( excitedly ) : So I have ! So I have ! She rings the bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , please ! Oh , your majesty ! This is Miss Nagg . Oh , please bring in the Prickly , I mean Prince Pettyjohn . I think I 've found something to amuse him . Really and truly I think so ! She hangs up the receiver nervously and looks at her wand I do hope it 'll work . Oh , I do hope so ! Enter running at the left the KING , QUEEN , and PRINCE , all with their bibs around their necks , and each with a banana or an orange in his or her hand . <p> PRICKLY PRINCE : Where is it , oh , royal wizardess ? Where 's my new present ? He stops short when he sees NED and NELLY Oh , excuse me . <p> KING CURLY-Q ( straightening his crown , wiping his mouth on his bib , and nudging MISS NAGG with his banana ) : Visitors to the royal palace ? Introduce me , Miss Nagg , introduce me . <p> QUEEN TITANA : Me , too ! <p> MISS NAGG : King Curly-Q , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is Nelly . <p> KING , QUEEN , and PRINCE ( bowing from the waist and speaking at the same time ) : **29;0;TOOLONG ! <p> QUEEN TITANIA : My name is Titania . <p> NED and NELLY ( shyly ) : Thank you , your majesties . We 're glad to know you , too . The KING , QUEEN , and PRINCE sit on their thrones and stooL <p> MISS NAGG : Ned and Nelly say that books are the most wonderful presents in the world . You can always have book friends with you when you have books . <p> NELLY : They are beautiful and interesting and thrilling ! You 'll love them and want to know more about their adventures just by seeing them . I know you will ! <p> NED : Books are great , really . Such fun ! And so exciting ! Go ahead , royal wizardess , and do your magic . <p> MISS NAGG ( eyeing her wand nervously ) : But it is a little warped . <p> KING CURLY Q ( folding his arms and gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in a loud whisper ) : And remember what will happen to you if it does n't work ! <p> MISS NAGG looks first at the PRICKLY PRINCE and then at NED and NELLY , who nod reassuringly at her Then she waves her wand in her left hand in three circles over her head . <p> MISS NAGG : Come , book friends ! Abracadabra ! Cadoodle ! Cadoo ! <p> They all wait for a moment , but not a thing happens . MISS NAGG buries her face in her hands . NELLY and NED exchange despairing glances.J <p> KING CURLY-Q : Humph ! <p> QUEEN TITANA Phsaw ! <p> PRICKLY PRINCE : I knew this stunt was too good to be true ! <p> NELLY : Books are n't too good to be true and all you have to do is to read them and find out . You can borrow books at any public library . And the ones you like best you can buy at bookstores . <p> NED : The best books you 'll read over and over again . What 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAGG : I know ! I held my wand in my left hand instead of my right ! She tries again to wave circles over her head , this time with her right hand . Come , book friends ! Abracadabra ! Cadoodle ! Cadoo ! <p> In the distance faint bells are tinkling , and the book friends are heard singing to the tune of " The Old Oaken Bucket . " <p> The fairy bell 's ringing ! <p> From Bookland we 're bringing <p> You greetings and singing <p> To come here and play ! <p> Adventures and treasure , <p> And hours of pleasure <p> And joy without measure <p> We 'll bring you today ! <p> Come with us to Bookland , <p> To dear magic Bookland , <p> To beautiful Bookland , <p> So friendly and bright ! <p> The music still sounds softly though the singing itself stops , when the BOOK FRIENDS , dressed as you see them in their picture books , troop in the doorway at the right . As the BOOK FRIENDS appear one by one , NED and NELLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderingly at them and the KING and QUEEN bow , stiffly at first , but in quite a friendly fashion later on . The PRINCE gets more and more pleased and excited as each new one greets him . <p> ROBIN HOOD ( smiling at the PRICKLY PRINCE and beckoning ) : Come with me to Sherwood Forest ! There will you a-hunting go , with Little John and Will Scarlet ! What adventure lurks behind every bush ! Maid Marian invites you , too ! COME WITH ROBIN HOOD ! <p> He disappears just as the PRICKLY PRINCE smiles and gets up . HANS BRINKER , clinking his silver skates , stands in his place . <p> HANS BRINKER : I 'm Hans Brinker from Holland . Come with me and I 'll show you that boys and girls in far-off lands have just as many exciting adventures and good times as you do . You 'll feel more friendly towards children of other lands when you learn that we are so much like you .

JO MARCH stands in his place . <p> JO : I 'm Jo March , one of Miss Alcott 's Little Women . When Father went to the Civil War and Amy , Beth , and Meg , and I stayed at home , we kept things humming , I can tell you ! After we met Laurie , what larks we had ! Come up in my apple tree and I 'll tell you about them ! She disappears with a wave of her hand and PETER PAN flutters in . <p> PETER PAN : I 'm Peter Pan of Never-Never-Land . Come with me to my treehouse and I 'll show you the pirates and Indians and mermaids and we 'll have more adventures with the Lost Boys ! Wendy will play Mother and tuck us in at night .
