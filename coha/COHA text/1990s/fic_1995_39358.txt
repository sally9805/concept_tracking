Finding things had always been her greatest pleasure . She was not systematic , not one of the ones who bought the local paper and mapped out a route between all of Saturday 's yard sales . What she loved was driving down the road and coming upon the sign  --  a rough paper bag tacked to a telephone pole , or a neatly lettered cardboard square stapled to a piece of wood : Garage , White Elephant , Rummage , Yard , Moving , Estate , Porch , Tag Sale . This , or even better , a trash heap with something old , something wooden and only slightly broken , leaning up against the bags or not quite buried among their fat , green shapes . <p> She found it difficult not to slow down on garbage day , found it impossible not to stop when she saw a sign , even if she had already been to a few sales that morning . Just for a second , she would tell herself . One sign would lead to another , and another , down side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrows until suddenly , like a guest who had come from far away , she 'd find herself in front of the house . <p> She loved that moment , looking up and seeing a big brick colonial , or a modern A-frame , or a tumbledown farmhouse with no front steps . Sometimes a little prefab ranch house with plastic deer in the yard would yield an intricate beaded purse from the twenties , or a faded handmade quilt with tiny black ants stitched around the flowered squares . In some ways , the less she liked the owner 's taste , the more chance she had of finding good stuff , since only things considered junk by their owners would be sold for pennies on the front lawn . <p> If she had time , she sometimes even lingered at a bad sale . People put amazing things out , put garbage , and this fascinated her as well , so that she looked at broken , burned kettles or stained baby clothes , old brassieres and potty chairs , half-filled bottles of hand lotion , boxes of unidentifiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup can  --  not old , certainly not antique . Cream of Mushroom , rinsed clean and put out on the table like a Warhol piece . Not a joke , she was pretty sure , unless the dour women behind the table had the driest and most hidden sense of humor she had even seen . Days when she was in a rush , she did a rapid , back-and-forth inventory with her eyes and hands , patting , brushing , rifling , the way her grandmother must have when she went to the open market in Russia as a girl . <p> Sometimes she would look down and spot a cobalt-blue salt shaker with a tarnished silver-plate casing , or a battered wooden shelf , or a painted tin box with buttons inside  --  and buried beneath the buttons , a pin marked Secret Seven , and small , sharp tools she could not name . Her throat would catch then , would actually get clogged with pleasure , and her hands would itch to polish and refinish , to rub oil in circles on the wood and touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hers  --  this bargain-hunting , poking-about obsession  --  was not shared by her boyfriend , Tom , who slept on a secondhand futon and kept his books in cardboard boxes . He had , in his studio apartment , exactly as many things as he needed : maybe three plates , two mugs , two blankets , one table , a coffee maker , two chairs , one desk , plus a few odds and ends that previous tenants had left shoved back on the kitchen shelves . This bothered her in a number of ways . First , she itched to fill up his place  --  to rummage through the backs of his cupboards , see what she could find , and then begin to accumulate , use wall space , organize books . Then that impulse irked her ; it made their roles seem so stereotyped , as if , in a cartoon of the two of them , she would wear an apron , grasp furniture polish in one hand and an old shelf in the other , while he would hold a cigarette and book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had met at the bookstore where they worked , both of them the same age and vaguely thinking of graduate school . She had noticed him her first day there because of his beauty  --  blond and chiseled , long-legged , long-haired , terribly careless , the kind of man she would have yearned for in high school , watched and obsessed over and never approached . <p> This time she did approach . They spent hours together working in the bookstore , of course , but it was she who invited him first for coffee ; then , in a phone call so difficult to make that she had to drink nearly a bottle of wine before she could do it , out to dinner . She was n't sure why she found the courage to invite him finally , except that she was tired of looking at men and hardly ever touching them , and something about him ( he seemed very alone and half-unaware of his own beauty ) made her brave . <p> At dinner they drank more wine , talked about books . She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hippie , someone who ate health food , and then she remembered his constant brief absences from work and realized he 'd been popping outside for a cigarette . She did not like it when he started to smoke in the restaurant  --  it jarred with her image of him  --  but in other ways he seemed perfect : smart , political , offbeat . Sometime late in the evening , back in her apartment , she touched his blond hair . They were drunk . A heavy lock was hanging over his eye , and she reached over and smoothed it back , which was very unlike her , to make the first move . It worked ; it was a revelation to her , that she did not have to wait , that she could lift her hand and make one tiny , stupid little move , and he would fall almost helplessly into her arms . <p> He loved sex . That was one of the confusing things about him . He was remote in a way ; he could be distant and judgmental , but he loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a leg , an arm , a toe linked with hers . He loved the curve of her hip , the back of her knee , her thick eyebrows . And he told her so , almost as if his own reaction had taken him by surprise , so that he seemed , in those moments , not the man who tossed his hair back in a gesture arrogant enough to belong to a rock star , not the almost surly , ironic bookstore clerk , but something else . He reminded her then of the sea anemones she had seen on the rocks in Olympia National Park . They were gray , thick-skinned , covered with barnacles , but on some impulse , one of them would breathe open , and you 'd see its insides , wet and smooth like the wall of a mouth , tulip pink or a nearly fluorescent green . <p> They had been together for a bit over a year the day she found the desk . It was not an easy relationship ; several times they had almost broken up . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritated with herself for it ; and he ( what was his story ? She was n't at all sure ) , he fell into moods so dark and long and private that she could only watch from a distance , moving from bemusement to irritation and frustration and , finally , suppressed anger and then bemusement again , since his moods would vanish without warning , and he would seek , almost desperately , her touch . <p> But the day she found the desk , things had been going all right . <p> It was early fall . They had talked , even , about living together soon . She , of course , had brought it up . She had wanted him to but had known he never would ; finally she had figured what the hell . He did not say no . He nodded and said they should think about it . She had been thinking about it , for much longer than she would ever admit to him . Sometimes , in her thoughts , they were in bed or shopping at the farmer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old chair , or at opposite ends of the couch with their feet entwined . Sometimes they were cooking , cutting up red and yellow peppers , sauteing garlic , or kneeling on an imagined screen porch tearing mint leaves from stems . <p> Other times , her mind grew smaller and she could n't see these things as well . He did n't like to cook , she would realize . He did n't , in fact , like furniture , or vegetables . He liked his apartment to be filled with boxes so that it always looked like moving day . One day she borrowed a book from him and noticed how the pages smelled like stale smoke . She did not let him smoke in her apartment , but if they lived together , she would have to . And if they broke up , her things would smell of his smoke , a lingering , persistent smell , and she would have to begin again . <p> She found an old school desk on the street . She was on her way home from work and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white house with a slate mansard roof , the kind of house an old widow probably lived in , with a car in excellent repair parked neatly in its drive . She pulled over , got out . It was an old , small , elegant child 's desk with rusted wrought iron legs and a dark wood top coated with grime . She put it in the back of her car , and when she got to her street , she parked and carried it to her apartment , hardly believing her good luck . By the time she got it up the stairs , her white shirt was smudged dark gray and deep crayony orange from the grime and rust . <p> At home she bathed the desk , washing off layer after layer of dirt until she reached its scarred , dark wood . She knelt in her bathroom , her jeans wet and smeared with dirt , her fingertips clean and wrinkled from the water . It was not until she was rubbing the desk down with Murphy 's Oil Soap , watching its colors deepen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its corner . <p> " Shit , " she said . <p> She had never seen one , not up close , not unmediated by a picture , a textbook , or a movie . She had grown up a non-practicing Jew in a small New England town full of Christians . Once or twice she had been asked by her teachers to explain Hanukkah , and a few times she had been called Jewgirl by some creepy boy , but among all the graffiti on desks in her years at school , she had never seen a swastika . Now here one was , right in her bathroom , spiked and symmetrical , written on her find like " Mary + Kenny " or " Fuck Physics " or " True Love Always . " <p> For a moment she backed up from the desk , which she had already grown to love , and saw it as something alien , hostile . It could have that look ; its legs were rusted , its feet commanding and thick . Its mouth was gaping , its ink hole as dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . She pictured a tough , angry , anti-Semitic little boy in the early nineteen-forties taking out a penknife when his teacher 's back was turned , making one line , waiting for the teacher 's back to turn again , making the next line . A tough guy , or maybe a quiet , hidden type , a careful carver , probably good at geometry , all the edges equally spaced out and straight . Asshole , she thought , and in her mind she slapped him hard across his pudgy , stunned , old-fashioned face . Or maybe it was more recent ; it would n't surprise her in this Vermont college town , which fancied itself progressive but did not like outsiders . She always seemed to find herself living in places where there were no Jews . <p> But then she looked at the desk again , and its wood was gleaming , and the swastika looked smaller , tucked up in the corner . The desk was , after all , a find , just waiting for her by the side of the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his twisted little mind , so had hundreds of other kids , or maybe he had n't even know what a swastika was , had just been imitating , or maybe it was a prewar carving . She had read somewhere that before Hitler took the swastika over and bent its edges , the same sign signified ( in India , or was it Japan ? ) something like eternal life . In any event , she had already decided , as she was driving home , where the desk would go  --  by the bay windows at the front of her apartment , with a cactus on it , and her old wooden flying shuttle , and the box that flipped inside out and turned into a stand covered with crooked , numbered hooks . <p> She hardly thought about what she did next ; she acted as if she had been issued a command , though she could not have said by whom . She went into the kitchen and got a sharp paring knife , rubbed the desk down with a cloth to make sure it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , she filled in the gaps on the symbol , made each line connect with another until there was not a swastika before her , but a neat four-squared grid . It still did not look right , her lines too raw and new , so she took a bottle of India ink and rubbed a little over the cuts , which ran in black until they looked like the old ones . Then she wiped the surface down with oil . It had worked ; you could never tell . <p> She would still have to get rust remover and repaint the legs black , but that could wait . She brought the desk into the main room of the apartment , pushed a trunk aside , and put the desk in its place . She covered it with its intended objects , backed up from it , and stared . It looked  --  she was quite sure  --  as if it belonged there . She put on some jazz and lay down to take a nap . <p> He half woke her with his key turning , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes he arrived like this , wordless and hungry . She loved that , the way they could dispense with all formality , all hellos , and simply greet each other with fingertips . They played for a while , nuzzling , half napping . Then he started to get up , to pee probably ; he peed more often than any man she had ever met . <p> She hesitated , but then the words came out . " Look what I got . " <p> She did not always show him her finds . He was not , for one , particularly interested , and it depressed her to hear his fake , conversational attempts to appreciate what she had brought home . But it went deeper than that , for on some level she felt he disapproved , found her too acquisitive , too much the consumer , he who went to Democratic Socialists of America meetings and never bought anything but books . Or perhaps it was her own discomfort with her quest for objects , the fact that she knew it to be dose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drive right by , but her hands would itch and her stomach contract with the grim , thudding feeling of having just lost a perfect thing . <p> Still , at times something made her want to show him  --  pride and pleasure , partly , in what she had found , but partly a desire to force herself out into the open , to admit her glee and see if he would still want her . <p> " The school desk , " she said . " By the front window . " <p> " Hold on . I 'm bursting . " <p> She lay there listening to the familiar splash of his pee , then the flush . <p> " By the window , " she repeated when he came back in . <p> He zipped as he walked , went over to the desk , ran a finger on its edge . <p> " Huh . Where 'd you find that ? " <p> " On the street , in someone 's garbage pile . " <p> " Yeah ? I guess they were cleaning out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has an inkwell , look . Behind the plant . " <p> He peered , nodded , and returned to her bed . <p> " My magpie , " he said . " My scavenger bird . " He kissed her neck and started to unbutton her shirt . She pictured herself then as <p> blackbird with a sharp , yellow beak , enfolding a pale , blond man in the iridescence of her wings . Was that what a magpie looked like ? She knew they were related to crows . She was n't sure she liked him calling her that , though he had been doing it since he first saw her drag something home off the street . Magpies , of course , collected bright metal objects and brought them to their nests . That was fine with her , but she had read in a bird guide at the bookstore that they killed other birds ' babies and ate their eggs , and she was quite sure they had some old , unfriendly association with Jews . <p> " Magpies do n't wear shirts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop him from unbuttoning her . That was when she told him , almost knowing she was asking for trouble , that his reaction would be complicated , though she could not have predicted exactly how . <p> " It had a swastika on it , " she said . <p> " What ? " <p> " The desk had a swastika carved on the top , in the corner . " <p> " Really . " He sat up . " Let me see . " <p> " It 's not there anymore . I got rid of it . " <p> He turned to look at her . " How 'd you do that ? " <p> " I carved it into a grid . " <p> He stood and walked over to the desk , lifted first the cactus , then the flying shuttle , until he found the etched black squares . He came back to the bed and sat leaning on the wall . <p> " That 's sort of a weird thing to do , do n't you think ? " <p> " Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or whatever . It 's still <p> swastika , underneath . " <p> " Well , I 'd rather not have it in my apartment . " <p> " But you do . " His voice was agitated , and she , too , suddenly felt panicked and unsure . " You do have it here , " he said . " I hate that about Americans . It 's not in your apartment if you color in the lines so you ca n't see it ? " <p> " Americans ? " She drew her knees to her chest , zipped her jeans , which he had undone . " You hate that about Americans ? Are n't you overgeneralizing a little ? Who are you , for example ? " <p> " Okay , " he said . " Okay , fair . Your call . " He sometimes used terms like this , as if they were in a law court or a sports field ; he had , in fact , been an obsessive athlete , a soccer player , before he discovered books . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nostalgic Americans , the kind who buy old washboards because they think they 're cute . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " Oh , come on , Sarah , " he said . " The whole antique thing . I mean , I do n't want to criticize you , and I guess I 'd rather be surrounded by your stuff than by , I do n't know , steel and chrome , but it 's this kind of false nostalgia . I mean , some lady buys a washboard because it has old writing on it and she thinks it 'll perk up her mantelpiece , but shit , someone broke their back using that washboard , and then they ditched it for a washing machine the second they could  --  if they could afford to . " <p> He 's right , she thought . The words always came to him so easily . And yet then she was not so sure . She hated , for one , the way he used the word " lady . " Why could n't the washboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman ? <p> " Ca n't someone buy a washboard , " she said , " because he wants to understand its history , not nostalgically  --  okay , maybe a little nostalgically  --  but mostly because he wants to touch stuff other people  --  in the past , you know  --  have touched ? It 's like a continuity or something ... " <p> She could n't explain what she meant , even though it was , in a way , so simple . She loved imagining all the fingers that had fingered the things she touched , all the faces that had looked at them , the dust that had sprinkled them , the light that had touched them , the conversations they had witnessed . But he did have a point . She had bought that wooden flying shuttle , after all , and though she had read about millworkers in college  --  the long hours , the accidents , the racket of the power looms  --  how much did she really think about it ? She had wanted the shuttle because it was shaped like two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , oily wood , with a tight skein of black yarn in its center and gleaming metal tips on each end . <p> " Okay , " he said , " then if an object carries history , you ca n't just whoosh it away . Someone carved a swastika on that desk . It 's part of its history . " <p> Yes , she thought , and was surprised at how strongly the thought presented itself to her : Part of its history , but not part of yours . <p> He was of old Norwegian-American stock . His family , on both sides , had been farming in the Midwest for over a hundred years , but by the time they got to him , they had prospered and left the land . One grandfather had been a businessman , the other a judge ; his father was a lawyer , like hers , though not , in fact , she imagined , like hers at all . She had never met his family , but she had seen pictures , and they all looked like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lusted after this sort of man . She did not know why . Perhaps it was some twisted form of self-hatred , or because they looked the opposite of her father , or maybe it was just that she grew up in a town filled with long-legged blond boys who played soccer and skied , and she yearned for them through her adolescence because they did not seem to yearn for her . When she got a little older , her taste changed , but just a bit . She liked the Waspy boys turned rebels , the ones who grew their hair and went to demonstrations , who left their thrones of privilege to work in food banks or even just bookstores . She wanted a political boyfriend , so why did she feel so angry now , so invaded , as if he were poking at her with a stick ? <p> " Jesus , " she said . " It 's a desk . It 's something I found on the street . You think I should have left that thing on it , kept it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You would n't have taken it . " <p> You would n't have seen it , she was thinking . He worked more hours at the bookstore than she did , and when he was n't there , or with her , he read  --  as he walked , as he sat on buses . <p> " Probably not , but if I had , I would n't have turned a swastika into a tick-tack-toe game . " <p> She turned away from him . <p> " What ? " he said . " I 'm just wondering why you did it . I would n't have done that . " <p> " You , " she said , " do n't know what it feels like to look at one of those things from my perspective , so I wish you 'd stop announcing what you 'd do . " <p> He knew she was Jewish , but they hardly ever discussed it , just as it hardly ever presented itself as a major fact in her life . It was more a subtle backdrop , a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself speak and was troubled to realize that she was not sure she meant everything she said . After all , she had reacted to the swastika when she first saw it in the bathroom , but it had not horrified her , not the way it perhaps should have . She had wanted the desk more , was n't that it ? She had found it and wanted it in her house , and changed it with a few rapid strokes so it could stay . <p> " You mean because you 're Jewish , " he said . <p> She nodded . <p> " Well , yeah , you 're right , I 'm not Jewish , but that does n't mean it does n't affect me . I 've read about it , for Christ 's sake , and tried to understand . " <p> " It 's a desk , " she said . " Some kid probably carved that thing without even knowing what it meant . Not everyone is as miraculously educated and conscious as you . " <p> " So first , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're Jewish , and then it means nothing at all because whoever carved it did n't know shit . You 're quite a contradiction . " <p> Was she quite a contradiction ? She guessed she was . She knew the Lord 's Prayer from going to church with her friends on Christmas Eve , and Baruch Atah Adonai from her family 's perfunctory Hanukkah celebrations . She had probably spent more time in churches than in synagogues , but as a girl , before her grandfather died , she had listened to him chant at Passover ( in Russia , his father had been a rabbi ) , and found herself oddly moved and fascinated by the plate in the middle of the table . First of all , it had compartments and was filled with things , and then the things themselves were so strange : the gnarled bone she wanted to suck on , the hot pink dump of horseradish , the cloudy , ashen egg . <p> Her grandparents on one side had died before she was born . The other set  --  now just her grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were as many people in one building as in her entire town , her father said . It had always felt like a different world there , one she was not sure of . Her father had gotten his law degree , married her mother , who was from Queens . They moved to a small town and had three girls . But the Bronx was where he had begun , in a building now gutted and burned out . Her parents ' furniture was Scandinavian and sleek , but her grandparents had heavy , old furniture in golds and maroons . Her grandmother kept plastic on the pleated lampshades and the arms of the couch and put out fake candied oranges in a cut glass dish . The apartment was overheated , cramped , with knickknacks on the windowsills and shelves . They ate dinner on tin card tables painted with flowers , and she was not allowed to have milk with meat , or help herself to dishes , or take the elevator alone . <p> When she was eleven , she read The Diary of Anne Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glossy photographs in the middle . It was then , she thought , looking back , that she had felt her Jewishness , not from the story , though it had moved her , obsessed her , even , in an almost perverse way , so that she half longed to be that girl , to have that garret life , that urgency and bright voice  --  the way she had wanted , earlier , to be the girl in The Little Princess , who was a pauper until her rich father returned . She was not , at the time , really able to consider what happened after the book ended , except as a fairy tale gone wrong , Gretel in the oven with no way out . <p> No , she had felt Jewish not because she understood the history , but because she looked like Anne , with the same sharp chin , the same dark , wavy hair and half-shy , half-playful grin . She had always known that she did not look like most of the girls in her town , who tended to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when she saw the photo , she thought , They would have seen me and known , and then , in a way , perhaps , she did feel the history , for she pictured herself backed against a door with her own face announcing her . In class the next day , the teacher , probably trying in her misguided way to be sensitive , asked Sarah how she had responded to the book . She felt all eyes upon her , an inky rush of shame . She ducked her head , shrugged her shoulders , and the teacher moved on . <p> Now she got up , went to the bathroom , peed . Usually she peed with the door open even when Tom was there , but this time she shut it . She saw herself then in the full-length mirror , a staring , dark woman with her jeans around her ankles , her knees sticking out . She loved her things , felt her home to be a safer , better place when it was filled with passed-along objects . Did she know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a history of pain , of labor , or did he have to point that out to her ? She looked around her bathroom . Someone once had bent the metal for her old tin box . Someone had mined the ore . Someone had painted the flowers , made the paint , the brush . <p> She pictured them all in front of her : the paint maker , the brush maker , the miner , watching her watch herself pee . It 's beautiful , she told them , but the words hung limp and overused inside her head . Was there room , anywhere , for her pleasure in the box 's black painted top and deep red flowers , its carefully crafted hinges ? In her mind they would not meet her eyes , all those makers . They just stood there and watched until her pee became a trickle , then stopped . <p> And the desk , people had made that , too , had suffered over it : metal workers , loggers in forests , makers of nails , of glue . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some who did not understand it , others who thought it either bad or good ; Jewish children , if there had been any around here back then . Maybe a German-Jewish girl shipped over to live with a farm family during the war . Perhaps she had lived in the very house where Sarah found the desk , crossed seas and kept her life , only to find , in this Vermont town , a jabbing , spiked cruelty . <p> It was hard to imagine it all ; she knew she could not , really , and yet at the same time , she knew , as she stood up and flushed , that the desk would have to leave . She could not say exactly why , except that the carving glowed neon and fierce now in her mind and the lines she had added seemed a travesty . And even if she could erase the sign , there was her talk with Tom and the way the desk would hold their words like a sponge . Her grandmother had sent her a mezuzah when she graduated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knew just where it was , in a small wax envelope in her filing cabinet . She had not put it up because she did not believe in God , not anyone 's God . But now she wanted it , as a superstition , a charm , one sign 's power over another . <p> She rinsed her hands and went into the main room . Tom was lying on his back , his eyes shut . <p> " Okay , " she said . " Okay , fine . I want to get rid of it . Help me carry it out . " <p> She did n't need his help , but she wanted it . She put the cactus on the trunk , the flying shuttle and box on the bookcase . He sat up , rubbed his eyes . <p> " Oh , come on , Sarah . It was just a discussion . " <p> " Help me carry it . " <p> " It 's a nice desk . I was playing devil 's advocate . You 're really going to throw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me carry it out . " <p> He got up and put on his sneakers . They carried it down the stairs ; he went backwards and she forwards . The desk was light , and at one point he said he 'd just take it on his own , but she did n't answer , and they kept at it the way they had begun , awkward , bumping , lifting it higher to get around corners . Finally they set it down on the front sidewalk . <p> He lit a cigarette . " I really think you 're overreacting . What do we do with it now ? " <p> " Someone will take it , " she said , but then she realized she did n't want it on her street , not in her neighborhood , even . She ran upstairs , put on her shoes , and got her keys , then came back down and opened the hatchback of her car . <p> " Oh God , " he said . " Where are you planning to go ? " <p> But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car , and then she got in the driver 's seat , and he tapped on the other side and she let him in . She did n't know where she was driving , only that she did not want the desk nearby , so she drove to where the houses were single-family , not carved into apartments , and soon she was in the neighborhood where she had found the desk in the first place , and then she made a few deliberate turns and pulled up to the curb by the house with the mansard roof . <p> " Here ? " he said , and she nodded . " How come ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> He put his hand on the door to get out . <p> " I 've got it , " she said . <p> She turned off the car and stepped outside . The garbage collectors must have come and gone since she had been there a few hours before ; the sidewalk was bare except for a few scraps of paper they had missed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk and set it down , its empty mouth facing the house . Maybe the old woman inside the house , or whoever lived there , would come out and see it , oiled but with its legs still rusty , a neat black grid etched on its left-hand corner . She did n't know if she hoped for this , did n't know , either , if she was angry at Tom for lecturing her this way and ruining the desk , or grateful because he had pushed her to get rid of what she now felt to be <p> cursed object . <p> She knew , standing there , that things probably would n't work out with him . It might take a while to fall apart ; he could be so tender , and she felt such a longing for his touch . But she wanted a man who loved wood ; it was almost that simple . She wanted a man who walked through the world and saw grain and nap , dirt and oil , a man who cut open green peppers and touched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green pockets covered with down like the hair on arms . She wanted someone who followed handmade arrows down dirt roads to places he had never been  --  a wanderer , a gatherer . It would n't work out not because of the sort of talk they had just had , but because of what followed , the fact that he called it a " discussion "  --  and that now , as she left the desk on the sidewalk , he was saying out the window how crazy this was , she should just keep it , she should put it back in the car . <p> Standing there , she , who never stopped gathering , never stopped collecting  --  she , the magpie with her beak full of metal scraps  --  thought for a moment about leaving them both there : the desk , the man . But she could not drive away without him . It was not his fault ; it was , if anything , her own , for she agreed with him now ( or at least she thought she did ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why throw out everything at once ? ( It sounded like something her grandmother would say . ) For a moment she wanted , even , to retrieve the desk , sand it clean of a history which was and was not her own , or put it back the way it was when she found it , etch that jagged sign on again and see if it brought her closer to what was , in the end , unimaginable to her , though she had the quick , dark eyes , the thick , black hair , and the feeling ( where did it come from ? She refused to believe it was in her blood ) that everything , at any moment , might slip away . <p> Finally , though , she suspected her own reasons . It was so pretty , that desk , when you looked at it in the light , with its arched , antic legs and big feet , its slanted top  --  like a colt , almost , mahogany and oiled . Get in the car , she told herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itching . She shut the hatchback , got in the car , drove away . <p>
