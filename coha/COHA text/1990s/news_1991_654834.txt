<p> EAST Africa is home to some of the world 's last remaining refuges for wild animals . People come from around the world to see them , especially the lions . Recently , I sat by a campfire in Tanzania 's Selous Game Reserve , one of the most remote parts of Africa , and listened to some lion tales . <p> Some animal stories are a blend of imagination and wonder , but these are true tales , according to the tellers ( whom I know and believe ) . Herbert Prins was one of them . He 's a Dutch wildlife researcher and has done a lot of work in East Africa . <p> One day , while working in Tanzania 's Lake Manyara game park , he came across a dead rhino . It looked like the work of poachers - people who kill animals illegally . Poachers take and sell the ivory tusks of elephants and the horns of rhinos . <p> Herbert drove to the game park warden 's office and told him about the rhino . The warden could n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway to try to track down the poachers . Herbert recalls the scene . <p> " We parked the car under a tree , walked for about 15 to 18 feet and suddenly we heard - RRRUGH , RRRUGH . We turned around . I had parked the car , without knowing it , under a tree with six lions in it . And these lions were jumping out of the tree . Every time one jumped out of the tree , it said ... RRRUGH . The warden said : ' Oh , lions . ' I was quite terrified at that time , but I thought , well , I can not show that I am afraid . So I said : ' Yes , lions . " ' <p> The lions followed them for awhile . Later , as Herbert and the game warden returned without finding the poachers , the lions were in their path . The game warden walked straight at them . Three lions moved away to the left of the track , and two lions went to the right . " We just walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car . There was still this one lioness sitting in the tree . She jumped out , and walked off - with a RRRUGH . I stepped into the car , and I asked the game warden : ' Were you not afraid ? Because I was quite afraid . ' He said : ' Of course not . I 'm a Masai ( a tribe in Kenya and Tanzania who often live in areas where lions live ) . We Masai are never afraid of lions . " ' <p> DAVID ALLEN was also around the campfire that night , on a steep bluff overlooking the Rufiji River - home to thousands of hippos . A former game warden and hunter in Kenya , today David is one of Kenya 's best bush pilots , flying people to remote game parks and reserves . He recalled a lion tale in the Massai Mara , a big game park in Kenya , Tanzania 's neighbor to the north . <p> " I took a walk out across the open plain toward a water hole . On the way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impala , and Grant 's gazelle . As I went along , the wildebeest were grunting at me and going UUGGH , UUGGH . As they went UUGGH , I would go UUGGH back at them . <p> " I went on walking . The impala would go WHHAA , WHHAA , and I would make reciprocal noises . Then I got up to the water hole . On the water hole there were some Egyptian geese , and they flew off . I walked around the water hole and started heading back to camp . It was wide open : just a few spindly little thorn trees . I headed back toward camp on a slightly different track . <p> " As I was going along , I suddenly heard URRGH . I looked up , and some 150 yards away to my left , I saw a lion , a young male lion , sitting up and looking at me angrily . So , I thought , there 's nothing more for me to do but carry on walking , as if I 'm not interested , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I carried on walking at a normal pace . And I suddenly heard , URRGH , URRGH , URRGH . And I look up , and he 's coming . Really coming , running ... and coming straight for me . So I just stopped in my tracks . I threw my arms up over my head , and I yelled out URRGH , back at him . He came to a screaming halt , looked at me , and turned around and ran back the other way . My hair was standing up on end . He 'd come to within about 70 yards away from me when he stopped and turned . And I was really happy that he did so . So I just carried on walking back to camp . " <p> Allen says lions are more likely to attack something running from them . By holding his ground he had a better chance . But the rule in Africa is not to walk in areas with wild animals . It 's not safe . A few places allow walking safaries , but only with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recall lion tales was George Adamson , probably Africa 's best-known lion expert . He helped captive lions learn to live free again in northern Kenya . The movie " Born Free " was about him and his wife raising a lion cub , Elsa , then setting her free in Kenya . <p> George was killed in 1989 , apparently by poachers . In an interview at his home a few weeks before his death , he told me about Christian , a lion he helped teach to live free again . Two Australians bought him as a cub from a department store in England , but later sent him to George in Kenya . A year later the Australians came to visit the lion . George recalled the scene . <p> " We went to the foot of the hill which is near the camp , and where I 'd taken Christian in the morning with some other lions . I went up the hill and called the lion Christian . And he followed me . And in coming down the hill he could see the two Australians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ( at this point George laughed , recalling the details ) the recognition dawning on him , and he rushed down to give them a tremendous welcome . Christian jumped up on the men , in a giant lion hug , standing on his hind feet , his forepaws on their shoulders . But he did not scratch them . <p> BY now the fire in our Tanzanian camp was down to red coals . Everyone else had gone to their tents . Camp director Carl Jahn , a German , was ready for bed , too . <p> " Good night , " Carl said . <p> " Did you just hear lions ? " I asked . <p> " I thought so , yes , " he said . " You can hear them from five miles in the night . " <p> Finally , we all went to our tents , where we could listen to the night sounds of Africa before falling asleep .
