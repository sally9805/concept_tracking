<p> When Clendon Lee bought his two-bedroom , Cape Cod-style house in Fairfax County 2 1/2 years ago , the best deal he could get on a fixed-rate mortgage was 10 5/8 percent . That meant his $ 182,000 loan was going to cost him $ 1,952 a month . <p> Today , Lee 's burden is considerably less . Thanks to plunging interest rates , he was able to dump his old mortgage and replace it with one saving him $ 481 a month . <p> " I 'm delighted , " said Lee . " For working stiffs like me , the rates are unbelievable . " <p> Lee said he is going to take some of the money he saves and " do what the president and Congress wanted me to do . I 'm going to spend it . " <p> The rest will go to pay off debts , he said . <p> Lee is not alone . Here and across the nation thousands upon thousands of Americans are parading to their lenders to trade in their high-rate loans from the 1980s for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Property owners with adjustable-rate mortgages ( ARMs ) are benefiting as well , as their interest costs shrink in step with the steep drop in rates engineered in the past year by the Federal Reserve to revive the economy . For a $ 50,000 loan over 30 years , each one-point drop in interest rates saves $ 35 a month . <p> Rates could head even lower as a result of yesterday 's sharp cut in the discount rate by the Fed . <p> Billions of dollars will be flowing back into homeowners ' pockets as a result , and if they follow Lee 's example , it will provide a big boost for the nation 's economy . ( There is a negative side to the slide in rates  --  a reduction in income that many people are receiving on savings accounts . ) <p> Americans have about $ 2.7 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding , on which they have been paying about $ 250 billion in interest each year . Some $ 162 billion of this debt will have been refinanced by the end of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' outlays by $ 10 billion or more , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America . And more refinancings are on the way . <p> " Clearly the reason is that rates are at their lowest levels in about 14 years , " said MBA Executive Vice President Warren Lasko . " People are refinancing from 10 1/2 or 11 percent down to currently in the neighborhood of 8 1/2 " percent on 30-year , fixed-rate loans , Lasko said . <p> Fifteen-year , fixed-rate loans are now at around 8 percent , and adjustable-rate mortgages come at even lower interest rates . <p> " We have adjustables that start at rates in the 5 1/4 percent range , " said Terry Rowland , general manager at Prosperity Mortgage , a subsidiary of Long &; Foster Real Estate Inc. here . " That 's an amazing number . " <p> Lasko noted , however , that much of the refinancing is by borrowers moving out of adjustable-rate mortgages , which were especially popular when rates were high , into fixed-rate loans to lock in low rates . <p> Rowland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustables " coming in to refinance , he said . <p> Not only are rates down , but " points "  --  up-front loan charges commonly imposed by lenders in recent years  --  are also fading , easing the sometimes daunting costs involved in refinancing . <p> While borrowers a few years ago might have expected to pay two or three points  --  each point equaling 1 percent of the loan amount  --  for a new mortgage a few years ago , now they can find deals with one or even zero points charged . <p> " I kept my eye on the local papers until I saw two lenders that offered loans without points , " said Peter Cimbolic , a psychology professor at the Catholic University of America who wanted to refinance his 30-year loan and a 20-year second mortgage into one new loan on his four-bedroom home in Annapolis . <p> When Cimbolic saw that , he pounced . Now he expects to sign papers next week for a new loan at 8 3/8 percent interest and no points . <p> As downward pressure on rates continues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everybody is saying , ' Is it worthwhile ? Should I do it ? ' " said financial planner Alexandra Armstrong . <p> For homeowners pondering those and related questions , experts offer this advice : <p> " A good shorthand approach " is to match your rate against those now offered , said Lasko . If you can get a new interest rate 1 1/2 to 2 percentage points lower by refinancing , you should consider it . <p> But homeowners should look carefully at their personal situation as well . Even with few or no points , there are costs associated with refinancing . Lenders will likely want a new appraisal of the property , a new credit report on the borrower , an updated title check and title insurance , and , possibly , a new survey . In many jurisdictions there are taxes for recording the loan , as well as title company or attorneys ' fees . <p> Jim Abbott , president of First Union Mortgage Corp . of Charlotte , N.C. , a mortgage banking firm that originates loans in all 50 states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the loan amount . <p> Thus the homeowner must be reasonably certain of remaining in the house long enough to recover these costs . The homeowner should determine what the new payment will be  --  there are tables or computer programs that do this , but lenders will also help  --  and subtract that amount from the current one . That difference , divided into the refinancing costs , shows how many months it will take to break even . <p> There are also tax considerations . Points paid in a refinancing can not be deducted all at once , as they can in a purchase , unless the money from the refinancing goes to improve the home . And there are limits on the size of the mortgage for which interest is deductible . Under current law , a homeowner generally may deduct the interest on a loan equal to the old one plus $ 100,000 . <p> But even if refinancing looks good , many homeowners are waiting , wondering if it will look even better in the future . Interest rate forecasts are notoriously unreliable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that a further slight drop is likely , and that the bottom is likely to come in the first quarter of 1992 . <p> " I do n't think that there is " any big hurry to refinance , said David W. Berson , chief economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association , a Washington-based company that makes money available for home loans by buying mortgages and packaging them into securities for sale to investors . <p> " There is always some risk that rates can move up but in the near term , unless some shock hits the system , I think the bigger risk is that rates will move down rather than up , " Berson said . <p> If the economy starts to pick up in the spring and a recovery is firmly in place by midyear , Berson said , he expects mortgage rates to start moving up . " But we are looking for much slower growth than would be normal coming out of a recession , so the increase would be pretty small . I 'd be surprised if rates were much over 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to 9 , " he said . <p> For the homeowner who decides that refinancing would be worthwhile and the best time for it is soon , the question remains : what kind of mortgage to get . <p> Thirty-year , fixed-rate loans are the staple of the U.S. housing market and remain the most popular mortgage . But lenders say they see a number of people refinancing , not to cut payments , but to build equity sooner or pay off their loans earlier . At current rates it is sometimes possible to switch from a high-rate 30-year loan into a new 15-year loan and keep the payment about the same . <p> CU 's Cimbolic is doing that . With the reduced rate , he will trade in a first mortgage with 25 years remaining and a second with 19 years left for a single 15-year first mortgage . His payment will rise by $ 60 a month , but he will be free of mortgage debt in 15 years rather than 25 . <p> For people interested in lowering their payments as much as possible , adjustable-rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beginning . Clendon Lee , for example , was able to get the big monthly payment decrease  --  from $ 1,952 to $ 1,471  --  by taking an ARM . <p> Lee said he " figured short-term rates on which ARMs are based will continue low . " <p> Another variation is the so-called 7-23 or 5-25 loans . With these , the interest rate is lower  --  around 7 1/2 percent  --  for the first five or seven years and then adjusts to the current market rate plus a premium of five-eighths of a percentage point . It is designed for people who are reasonably certain they will be moving or refinancing before the adjustment . <p> Nita Bazzone of McLean will clip $ 125 a month off her mortgage costs by refinancing the loan on her town house with a 7-23 mortgage at an initial rate of 7 7/8 percent . The rate on her former mortgage was 9 7/8 percent . She wanted lower payments and expects to move before monthly payments go up at the end of seven years . She could have gotten a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to put out the additional cash . <p> " I think it 's a smart move , " said Bazzone , a real estate broker . " I think anytime I can save anyone $ 125 a month I 've done my job . In that respect I feel like I 've been kind to myself . " <p> Some homeowners , though , are finding themselves unwelcome at the refinancing party . These people bought expensive houses in 1988 and 1989 and now find that the value of their homes has declined so much that lenders will not write them a new mortgage even for the same amount as their old one . <p> This is most common in the Northeast , but has happened here . " We have n't seen a lot of problems " with appraisals in the Washington area , said Kevin J. O'Neil of NVR L.P. , a homebuilding and finance firm in McLean , but " there is some of that in higher-priced property . " <p> People in this situation must either keep their loan or refinance a smaller amount , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is n't practical , said Rowland , these homeowners can consider making extra payments of principal . This way , if rates stay down and prices recover somewhat , they may be able to refinance later on .
