How to Predict the Future // Some people try to predict the future by assuming current trends will continue . This is a bad method . For example , if you applied that forecasting method to a puppy , you 'd predict that the puppy would continue growing larger and larger until one day-in a fit of uncontrolled happiness-its wagging tail would destroy a major metropolitan area . But that rarely happens , thanks to the National Guard . // The future never follows trends , because of three rules I have named after myself in order to puff up my importance . // Adam 's Rule of the Unexpected // Something unexpected always happens to wreck any good trend . Here are some examples to prove my point : // Good Trend Unexpected Bad Thing // Computers allow us to work Computers generate 300 // 100 percent faster percent more work . // Women get more political power.Women are as dumb as men . // Popular music continues to get better.I get old . // Adam 's Rule of Self-Defeating Prophecies // Whenever humans notice a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doom causes people to do things differently and avoid the doom . Any doom that can be predicted wo n't happen . // Here are some examples of dooms that people predicted and how the indomitable human spirit rose to the challenge and thwarted the prediction : // Prediction of Doom Human Response // Population will grow faster than Scientists realize you can callfood supply.just about anything a " meat patty . " // Petroleum reserves will be Scientists discover oil in their depleted in twenty years.own hair . // Communism will spread to the All Communists become // rest of the world.ballerinas and defect . // I might have some of the details wrong ; I 'm working from memory here . But the point is that none of those predictions came true once we started worrying about them . That 's the way it always works . // Adam 's Rule of Logical Limits // All trends have logical limits . For example , computers continue to shrink in size , but that trend will stop as soon as you hear this report on CNN : // This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his spray destroyed the entire military computing hardware of North America , leading to the conquest of the United States by Haitian bellhops . More on that later , but first our report on the healing powers of herbal tea . // At that point , we 'll say , " Hey , maybe those computers were too small . " That will be the end of the shrinking computer trend . // If all trends end , what can we look at to predict the future ? There are some things in life so consistent that they are like immutable laws of human nature . You can predict most of the future by looking at these immutable laws and applying logic . // Immutable Laws of Human Nature // Stupidity // Selfishness // Horniness // Those are the things that will never change , no matter what else does . People do n't change their basic nature , they just accumulate more stuff upon which they can apply their stupidity , selfishness , and horniness . From this perspective , the future is n't hard to predict . // I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only opening my kimono , but I 'm also doing jumping jacks in front of your picture window , if you catch my visual gist . But I 'm not worried about you learning my secrets , because I 'll always be one step ahead of you . // Prediction Two // In the future , you will wish I had never put the image in your head of me doing jumping jacks in an open kimono . //
