<p> At a sleepy Tower Records in the suburb of Encino , Andrea Stover , 13 , was combing the aisles for CD 's with her mother and her younger sister . In her hands , she had debut CD 's by the rhythm-and-blues singer Usher and the pint-size pop siblings Hanson . Asked whether she would buy follow-up albums by these artists , Andrea responded , " Why would I get the same group again ? " <p> Her mother , Amy , 42 , shook her head in disbelief . " It 's crazy , " she said . " When I was young , I had to have every Grateful Dead album . I have a great record collection , but they just keep barreling through new stuff . They 'll listen to a group all the time and then I 'll never hear from them again . " <p> A new generation gap is opening up among rock and pop fans . The difference is n't necessarily in the kind of music baby boomers and their children listen to . After all , Oasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five , and members of Pearl Jam are avowed fans of the Who and Led Zeppelin . What 's different is the way they consume that music : the elders stood by their favorite bands while the young constantly chase after the new . <p> Record industry executives say pop music , particularly rock , is changing from a genre that gave rise to career artists ( the Beatles , the Rolling Stones , Bob Dylan , Michael Jackson ) to one supported by a succession of young , transient acts . And in the concert industry , which earns most of its revenue from baby-boomer bands , executives are beginning to panic because most of these younger acts are not building a loyal fan base and their ticket sales are languishing compared with the success of their albums . As the comedian Chris Rock said about the pop scene when he hosted the MTV Video Music Awards , " Here today , gone today . " <p> Etty Lewensztain , 15 , another shopper at Tower who was buying her first and , most likely , only CD 's by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said : " I 'd rather get a new band than one I 've already heard . Diversity is fun . I do n't like to stick with one singer . " <p> This kind of shopping pattern is befuddling the music industry . " There was a period when every time Atlantic put out a new Led Zeppelin album , we had four million of sales guaranteed , " said Val Azzoli , the co-chairman and co-chief executive of Atlantic Records . " Now , I do n't know . " <p> According to the Billboard charts , none of the albums that reached No. 1 in 1960 , 1970 or 1980 were debuts . In 1990 , the only No. 1 debut was by Vanilla Ice . But last year , four bands reached No. 1 with their first albums and the three top-selling albums of the year ( by the Spice Girls , Jewel and Puff Daddy ) were all debuts . <p> Meanwhile , records that were expected to be major successes in 1997  --  by career artists like Janet Jackson , the Rolling Stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ En Vogue  --  were outsold by these debut albums , as well as those by Puff Daddy , Hanson , the Wallflowers and Erykah Badu . But when those debut acts tried to capitalize on their popularity by releasing a second album ( the Spice Girls 's " Spiceworld " ) or by touring ( the Wallflowers ) , sales were disappointing . <p> The proliferation of choice is one factor driving the change , said Pete Howard , the editor of the CD newsletter ICE . In the 1960 's , an average of 45 albums were released a week . Now the average is 710 CD 's a week . <p> Also , a survey by the research company Soundata shows that consumers who once selected record stores based primarily on low prices now look for the widest or most interesting selection . Furthermore , the survey showed that 40 percent of record shoppers in 1996 , compared with 28 percent in 1993 , will buy a full CD by a band after hearing only one song they liked , giving new musicians with one hit a quick jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders  --  have always been a staple of the industry , executives say , but never in the history of rock has the business been so driven by songs ( as opposed to bands ) performed by acts that burst into the limelight out of nowhere and disappear as quickly as they come . <p> Last year , Atlantic was the industry 's No. 1 label , claiming 8 percent of the market , and Mr. Azzoli credits this almost entirely to debut albums by acts like Jewel , Duncan Sheik , Sugar Ray and Matchbox 20 . Looking ahead , he said , " the only thing I can depend on is that our big-selling acts will be new acts . " <p> Meanwhile , rock acts that seem to have long-term potential ( Beck , Ani DiFranco , Phish ) are not the ones selling the most albums . <p> " People 's tastes are about wanting things increasingly faster , " said Guy Zapoleon , a consultant for some of the country 's top radio stations . " Their attention span and interest in music has become shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tire of things quickly . " <p> Though this kind of turnover does little for artist development , it can be cost-efficient because young acts generally receive lower royalty rates , smaller advances and eat up less of a label 's budget . <p> " The good news is that your profit margins are better , " Mr. Azzoli of Atlantic said . " The bad news is that you have to manage your business differently . You ca n't look at the upcoming year and figure out what 's going to happen and budget accordingly . You do n't know what 's going to hit and what is n't . " <p> The head of one major label , speaking on condition of anonymity , said it was not fickle record-buyers who were to blame for diminishing rock careers , but the fact that most labels were owned by large , publicly traded corporations that expect instant results . The situation has been exacerbated , he said , by the rise of Soundscan , a company that has turned music sales statistics from guesswork to an exact science this decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's release , critics , fans and the band 's record label can deem it a success or a failure based on its sales during a six-day period . <p> " The corporations do n't want you to tell them that you can break an act in two years , " he continued . " They want results in six months . So you stop thinking about developing artists as your main business . " <p> It was once common for bands to struggle with their first few albums and tour relentlessly before breaking through to a mainstream audience . Bruce Springsteen , for example , was vaunted as the new Bob Dylan when he was signed to CBS Records ( now Columbia ) in 1973 , but it took him until his third album ( " Born to Run " ) to be considered a success . Today , many in the industry said , an artist like Mr. Springsteen would be dropped by his record company , or at least be considered not worth promoting . Albums without potential hit singles , they said , are generally not released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bad for artists too . The recent spate of instant hits  --  including Sugar Ray 's " Fly , " Smash Mouth 's " Walkin ' On the Sun , " Meredith Brooks 's " Bitch , " Verve Pipe 's " The Freshmen " and even " Tubthumping " by Chumbawamba , a band that formed 15 years ago  --  has music executives blaming radio and music television 's emphasis on songs over musicians . <p> " Radio and MTV do n't care if you had a hit with your last single , " said one talent scout , who spoke on condition of anonymity . " It 's all about the single , and there 's no loyalty to bands . That 's why you see record labels working one hit single for months longer than they used to ; they do n't know if they 're going to be able to get their next song on the radio . " Predicting Just Who Might Endure <p> A band that becomes associated with just one song has trouble transcending this one-hit appeal to sustain a career . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , bands often put as much as two years into promoting a hit song or album in an international music market expanding deeper into Asia and South America . <p> Then there is the pressure of living up to previous success . This year , Alanis Morissette is due to release her second album after three years , while Nine Inch Nails and Hole are expected to release their third full-length albums after a four-year hiatus . The high school sophomore who bought Hole 's or Nine Inch Nails 's last record is likely to be in college or working and have completely different musical tastes . Not everyone , however , agrees that music in the 90 's has become the domain of one-hit wonders . Lisa Worden , the music director at the alternative-rock radio station KROQ in Los Angeles , said the rock audience is still loyal and passionate , and she pointed to acts like Smashing Pumpkins , Pearl Jam , Foo Fighters , Bush and Nine Inch Nails as possible career artists . <p> Still , many in the concert business feel that the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs over careers . In its annual roundup of the year 's top-grossing tours , Pollstar magazine observed that the business " remains completely dominated by older acts " like the Rolling Stones , U2 and Fleetwood Mac , leaving concert promoters worried about " a lack of new headliners . " <p> Larry Lahaie , the public events manager of the Omaha Civic Auditorium , said , " Music is not developing like it used to . A lot of bands are n't paying their dues , going to the small clubs and building a loyal live audience . They jump from small clubs to arenas immediately , and then disappear . " <p> Music executives see a few possible outcomes . One view is that the panic over inadequate artist development , noncommittal teen-age fans and mediocre fly-by-night pop acts is just more baby-boomer grousing about the good old days , and that in a decade or so the groups now seen as disposable will be rock 's new institutions . <p> Others say popular music is merely in transition as the alternative-rock sound fades and radio swings back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batch of innovators worthy of a loyal following . <p> And finally there is the diversification theory , whose proponents argue not only that the concept of a rock career is truly dying , but also that as the Internet rises to prominence as a means of CD distribution , the music audience will further fragment to support even more new artists . <p> A study by Jupiter Communications , an Internet research company , shows that while 80 percent of the customers at record stores buy music from 25 percent of the artists in stock , buying patterns at on-line record stores are much more diverse ; instead of sales clustering around a select group of pop artists , they spread evenly across all genres , from rock to blues to classical to jazz . <p> Perhaps the chorus of the current hit " Semi-Charmed Life , " by yet another new band , Third Eye Blind , captures this phenomenon best : " I want something new .
