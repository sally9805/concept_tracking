It was no dream . Brandon 's spine shook in small , steady vibrations . His bed squeaked . Glass crashed . Someone screamed . Get in the doorway , he thought . Rolling out of a gyrating bed , he stumbled across the bedroom carpet , which was alive with motion . Clutching the sturdy door frame , he heard frightened sobs coming from down the hallway . Then all movement stopped . There was silence . " Brandon ? You O.K. , son ? " His father 's voice sounded anxious . " Yeah , I 'm fine . Are you guys all right ? How 's Ellen ? " " She 's in labor . " Two shocks in one night , thought Brandon . " Are you sure ? " He kept the resentment out of his voice . " Definitely , your stepmother 's having contractions , hard ones . " Brandon felt embarrassed by a surge of mixed emotions . It 's just a tiny baby coming . I 'll be nothing to Dad and Ellen . She 's not my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I need you to put on some shoes and find a flashlight I heard glass break , " said his dad . Brandon found his sneakers . Touching the wall , he groped cautiously down the hall . Fumbling through a table drawer , he located a flashlight and clicked it on . " What ! This happened in 20 seconds ? " He gasped the words . Crazy tilted , upside-down furniture cast weird shifting shadows as Brandon swung the light back and forth . Table legs poked the air . The walls were bare of pictures , their glass smashed and scattered about A heavy bookcase was tossed over the furniture , its contents everywhere . " Oh . " Ellen 's pained voice came from the master bedroom , and Brandon made his way there . " Help me get her to the truck . This baby 's coming-earthquake or not , " said his father . " O.K , but be careful , everything 's a mess . " Brandon guided them through the wreckage to the pickup parked in the driveway . He helped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scrambling in beside her , he clicked together his own passenger side belt . " Dad , do n't forget ... " " Brandon , enough with your driver 's training class . " His dad 's voice was edgy . Fearful of angering his dad in his awful worry , Brandon said nothing when his dad failed to buckle up . I 'll remind him later , he thought " You guys , this is creepy . All the lights are out ... ca n't see anything , " said Brandon as his dad backed the truck out onto dark Balboa Boulevard . The penetrating truck lights outlined crushed buildings . Ghostly figures stood in small clusters , stunned , mouths agape , staring unbelieving at their wrecked homes . " Oh ... ah ... I 'm having another contraction . " Ellen was leaning forward clutching her stomach . As his dad passed him the watch to time Ellen 's contractions , Brandon noticed an orange glow backlighting a small hill up the road . When they topped the rise , the glow became an eerie bright orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized he was looking at fire . A sheet of flames leaped out of a jagged trench where the road used to run . " Hit the brakes , Dad ! The street 's on fire , " Brandon shouted . Before his father could apply the brakes , Brandon heard a splash , then a slushing , gurgling noise . He was astonished to see white , foaming water swirling around the truck 's tires , boiling out of sewers . The truck was sliding sideways through the flooded street toward the yawning , burning trench . " Gas and water lines must be broken , " his father said tersely as he fought to regain control of the truck . Only yards from the edge , Brandon could see down into the flaming cavern . We 're going to die , he thought . Ellen screamed . Brandon took her hand in his . " It 'll be O.K. " He hoped she believed him . As he held his breath , the truck slid to within inches of the chasm 's edge . Jolt The truck came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , Brandon thought , we 're not in the trench . A buckle in the pavement had saved them . He looked at his dad . His father sat slumped against the driver 's side window , not moving . " C'm on , Dad ! Get us out of here . We 're going to blow up . " Brandon was sweating from the intense fire . His father shook his head . His temple was oozing blood from a blow due to the sudden stop . Dazed , he mumbled something . Turning the wheel he began to accelerate . But the truck was slow to respond on the flooded asphalt . Brandon could feel the tires slip ping , moving . Slowly . Too slowly . Away from the burning . The air reeked of tar and natural gas . Hot air burned his throat . His lungs were full of heat . Gradually , the air became cooler . Oxygen began to flow into tortured lungs . " Dad , DAD ! ! ! " As Brandon 's own panic subsided , he saw his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whump . The slow-moving truck slammed up , then down . Through the windshield , Brandon could see they had jumped a curb . Now the truck was crawling over someone 's lawn . " Dad , DAD ! We 're going to hit a house ! " He tried to reach the brake pedal with his left foot , but Ellen , who was now turned toward his dad and shaking him , blocked his way . Do n't panic . Think . Reaching around her , he groped for the keys and turned off the ignition . Breathless , he watched a wall of the house grow larger . The truck sighed to a stop just inches short of the front door . " Aaa ... ah ... oh .... " Suddenly Ellen was choking and gasping . " Another contraction . " He hid the fear in his voice . " Do n't worry , Ellen , I 'll get you there . " Unbuckling her seat belt , he pulled her gently over to the passenger side . Closing Ellen in , he ran to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His father had fallen across the middle of the seat . He moved his dad 's feet and legs away from the clutch and brake pedals . Climbing in , he could barely close the door . Head spinning , he pushed in the clutch and bumped backward at high speed out onto Balboa Boulevard . Ellen screamed as the truck jolted up and down . Hands shaking , Brandon forced himself to slow down as he looked for another route to the hospital . " Oh ... help me , " Ellen moaned . " O.K. , O.K.-hang on ! I 'll turn here . " Thank God I 've had driver 's ed , thought Brandon . He made a right turn . It was a dead-end street . In the headlights he could see scurrying people directed by a policewoman . They were the rescue workers . " Officer , can you help me ? I 've got to get my stepmom help-she 's going to have a baby ! " " You 're not far from the hospitaltake Sixth Avenue . It 's just one mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get these people out of their houses or I 'd help you . " The officer hurried away . " Oh ... oh ... you can find it , ca n't you ? " " No problem . " He hoped she could n't hear the doubt he felt . At Sixth Avenue he could see the outline of the hospital as morning dawned . For the first time he felt relief . Cha-chunk . The truck jumped up , then down . He had driven the front wheels into a massive pothole . " Reverse , put it in reverse , Brandon , " he muttered . Tires squealing , the pickup leapt backward out of the pothole . " I think the baby 's coming , " Ellen cried out . Gunning the truck around the pothole , Brandon sped down the street . Within seconds , he pulled into the hospital 's emergency entrance . " I 'll get someone-for you and Dad ! " Brandon dashed through the emergency room doors . Sometime later , outside the delivery room , he had nodded off to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke him . " You O.K. , Dad ? " Nervously , he watched as his father touched a purple gash on his forehead . " Fine , son . " His dad smiled . " What about Ellen-and the baby ? " " It 's a boy ! They are both doing great . Come in and see for yourself . " Ellen lay with the infant in her arms . Brandon could n't take his eyes off him . " You want to hold the baby ? " Ellen looked at Brandon with a grin . " I ... I do n't know . He 's so little . " " You wo n't break him . " " All right . " Carefully following her directions , he picked up the baby . Cradling the infant , he touched the baby 's skin and looked into his eyes . Brandon cleared his throat . " Hello , little guy . Do n't you worry about a thing . I 'll watch out for you . I 'm your big brother . " <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
