Alabama Democratic Senator Howell Heflin was in no danger of losing his seat in last November 's midterm elections , but that did n't stop him from recruiting colleagues to help his campaign . One of those who answered the call was Ohio Democrat John Glenn . The former World War II hero and pioneer astronaut filmed a spot extolling Heflin 's support for the space program , which brings millions of tax dollars to Alabama . In spite of the seemingly innocent nature of the plug , the commercial never aired . Reason : Heflin 's first order of business upon his return to Washington was chairing the Senate Ethics Committee investigation of the infamous Keating Five , which included the same John Glenn . A Heflin spokesman says the ad " just did n't fit in " with campaign plans , but wiser heads had advised the Alabaman 's office about the impropriety of using Glenn  --  who eventually received a mere slap on the wrist  --  as a character witness .               @ @ @ @ @ @
