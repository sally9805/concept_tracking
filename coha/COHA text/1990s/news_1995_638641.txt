<p> Judicial system not perfect , but critics should be fair <p> This letter is in response to Lys Tourjee 's letter of July 13 , regarding the trial of Tom Rivard . <p> As the attorneys who represented Rivard at trial , we are concerned with the impression of the judicial system that was left by Tourjee 's letter . <p> Under the cloak of concern for the community , Tourjee 's letter really amounts to an illegitimate criticism of the jury verdict and a blatant attempt to apply pressure upon the court to impose a sentence greater than what is fair and just under the circumstances of this case . Unlike Tourjee , the 12 individuals who made up the jury were unbiased , conscientious and thoughtful citizens who carefully considered all of the evidence and rendered a fair verdict based on that evidence . <p> It is telling that Tourjee recites only half the facts in his attempt to incite your readers to action . What Tourjee omits is that Robert Ursetta was a two-time convicted felon , a drug dealer with a history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun . On the night of the shooting , Ursetta was drunk and high and stabbed Rivard , who is legally blind and hearing-impaired , twice with a broken bottle , once in the neck and once in the back . Those injuries put Rivard in the hospital , and they were documented by photographs admitted at trial . Based on these facts , the jury , after deliberating seven hours , acquitted Rivard of first degree murder and second degree murder . <p> However , contrary to Tourjee 's assertion , the jury held him every bit accountable for contributing to this tragedy . By convicting Tourjee of reckless manslaughter , the jury sent a powerful message to the community . It is not acceptable to carry a gun , and even if you use it only in self-defense , you may still be responsible for the consequences . <p> We can all understand and empathize with the pain felt by the friends and family of alleged victims , but Tourjee 's letter illustrates perfectly the reason why juries are composed of unbiased citizens of the community . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system is so often shaped by misinformation and half-truths . Although our system is not perfect , it will not be improved by attacking those who fulfill their civic duty by serving as jurors . <p> PAMELA DAYTON <p> SUSAN FISCH <p> Deputy State Public Defenders <p> Denver <p> GOP has a chance for more than rhetoric <p> As a registered Republican who has had no previous interest in the Animas-La Plata project , I found your July 12 article interesting , informative and disappointing . <p> During the three decades that I have followed Washington politics , the consistent rallying cry of the House Republicans was that the party in control was passing one pork barrel project after another . <p> Now the Republicans are in control , and while there is a great deal of rhetoric about cutting the pork , it is clear that the real change is who gets the pork , not how much there is . <p> I agree with Rep. Scott McInnis that we must , for once , live up to our obligations to Native Americans . However , he indicated only one-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other two-thirds provides little benefit , beyond welfare to owners of the 50,000 acres to be irrigated . With the exception of Sen. Ben Campbell , who has consistently represented Native American interests since his election , the Republicans in the House , as well as Sen. Hank Brown , show a great lack of integrity and honesty when finally given a chance to prove the truth of their past campaign promises . They have unfortunately shown even less honesty than the Democrats who preceded them . The rallying cry for ' 96 will be , again , " Throw the Rascals ( Bums/Liars ) Out ! " <p> KENNETH L. COVELL <p> Colorado Springs <p> Preserve public funding of the arts <p> Preserve the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities . <p> Public funding for the arts is an appropriate task for government - name one great civilization in world history whose government was not a major arts patron . <p> National Public Radio - funded in part by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting - is the only thing that keeps me sane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to get in-depth news information and features . <p> Forty years ago , the only place you could see theater was in New York City ; today , thanks in no small measure to federal funding , small theater groups are enriching the lives of many Americans in small cities and towns across the country . <p> Bob Dole is now in the habit of parading around , chanting about how Hollywood and the media are contributing to the sleazing of good American values . <p> Well , public television is about the only place to get quality programming . The irony of Dole 's assertions ( which are probably true ) vs. his politics ( cut funding of these agencies ) is unbelieveable . <p> Just because there have been a few controversies about arts funding recipients is no reason to eliminate funding for all . <p> Enriching a nation 's cultural life is not a superfluous effort . Tell your representatives to preserve the NEA and NEH . <p> TODD RUNESTAD <p> Boulder <p> We 'd like the real story of Waco <p> The long , rambling article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explaining " Why we had to act in Waco , " begs for comment . <p> I will leave it to others to point out glaring factual errors in his accounting of the events surrounding Waco , and instead I will focus on the matter of search warrants . <p> Higgins states : " The law requires that when served a warrant , we comply with the warrant and let the judicial system determine our ultimate guilt or innocence . Had the Davidians done so , there would have been no subsequent loss of life on either side . " Is Higgins confusing search warrants with arrest warrants here ? <p> Let 's be frank . If you are " on the outs " with the federal government these days , a federal search warrant usually means that the front and back doors of your home will be kicked in , ideally when you least expect it , and preferably when you 're at home . Agents will enter with weapons drawn , and you will be held at gunpoint for hours while your home is searched for evidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments of terror , a cruel perversion of their intended function in a system of justice . Waco is particularly notable in that a federal agency is strongly suspected of having additionally used search warrants to provoke violent confrontation and justify mass murder . This , Mr. Higgins , is why the American public ( some of us anyway ) want full disclosure of what went on at Waco . <p> RON BLEWITT <p> Littleton <p> It 's time to eliminate <p> mental health care fraud <p> In her article , " Mismanaged care : a crisis in mental health , " psychiatrist Joan Shapiro misplaces the blame for the ills of the mental health industry . Psychiatrists , not insurance companies , create this " crisis . " <p> Shapiro whines about the " rapid erosion of insurance for mental health services " when she should be thankful insurance covers psychiatric services at all . In 1992 , Congressional hearings were held to investigate nationwide patient abuse and insurance fraud . Insurance company lawsuits cited more than $ 1 billion in fraudulent psychiatric claims . Among the charges were such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were not mentally ill , holding them against their will until their insurance ran out . More than $ 900 million in fines and penalties were levied against the psychiatrists and psychiatric hospitals involved . <p> Similar cases frequently make headlines . Just last week , the Boston Herald ran a story about a psychiatrist who is claiming that " voices in his head " drove him to submit fraudulent Medicare and Medicaid claims . This psychiatrist also threatened to blackmail patients if they testified against him . He is using the insanity defense , but asks not to be considered completely insane . <p> It 's time we eliminate mismanaged care in mental health and repeal the laws that allow psychiatrists to " treat " a person for a mythical " illness " against his will and force his insurance company to pay for it . No other industry has this power . Why should we grant it to psychiatrists when they abuse it ? <p> MARK STOUT <p> Denver <p> Is money the key ? <p> If a young man in his 20s with a 10-year arrest record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store was given a light sentence by a judge , our upper classes would go bananas . Politicians would scream about judges " coddling criminals . " But when a Neusteter child , born into wealth and privilege , holds up a convenience store , gets an amazingly light sentence , politicians are silent and the upper classes are smug . <p> PETER GROSS <p> Denver
