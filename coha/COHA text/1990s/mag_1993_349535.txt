If you were a 12-year-old boy on a solo Save the Whale campaign , well , you 'd slap your favorite marine mammal into a truck for a drive to the Pacific Ocean . And to keep him refreshed , you 'd probably run him through an automatic car wash . And then , like an animal tamer who uses love instead of a whip , you 'd get your adorable orca to leap over a high jetty so he could be reunited with his pod . You 'd go that far for a friend . Where there 's a whale , there 's a way . <P> Here comes Free Willy , this month 's feel-good sleeper . Preview audiences have gone wild for Willy , the story of two 12-year-olds separated from their folks . Jesse ( Jason James Richter ) is a troubled boy who , while cleaning up the graffiti scrawled on the walls of a seaquarium theme park in the Pacific Northwest , bonds mystically with a 7,000-lb. , 22-ft. - long killer whale named Willy . Aided by his foster parents and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it his mission to free the sweet beast . <P> The film , written by Keith A. Walker and Corey Blechman and directed by Simon Wincer ( TV 's Lonesome Dove ) , has a no-fault recipe for success . Start with Jurassic Park 's fondness for huge , dangerous , pet-worthy creatures and its cunning use of special effects to make the fauna realistic . Add a dollop of Hollywood eco-mania , portraying the park owner as a predatory capitalist who would kill Willy for the insurance money . And wrap this around the summer 's favorite icon : the fatherless boy who teaches everyone else  --  surrogate parents , adult friends and a nearby cetacean  --  how to be human . The movie hits every emotional button with a firm fist . It makes the phrase feel-good sound like a command from the industry 's P.C. Patrol . <P> There 's no denying , though , that Free Willy is a clever movie toy for the kid market . Most of the time Willy is played by Keiko , a killer whale ( actually a type of dolphin ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But frequently Keiko is spelled by a stunt double : a high-tech robot coated with 3,000 lbs . of eurythane rubber . ( There is also a Turbo Willy -  --  essentially the top of the whale , with mammoth hydraulic propellers on the bottom . ) How real were the fake Willys ? Persuasive enough so that the real Willy got the hots for them . " Whales are well-endowed animals , " notes Walt Conti , the effects magician who created the seductive stand-ins . " It 's pretty obvious he was attracted . " <P> Free Willy has other attractions . Richter is an appealing , unaffected young performer ; and Willy , with his black-and-white shading and fine Deco design , is a handsome brute . He 's smart enough to understand complex English sentences , nodding an appropriate yes or no to Jesse 's questions . And like any ingratiating adolescent , Willy knows how to make bad manners look cute . The children who giggled in Jurassic Park at the sight of a paleobotanist elbow- deep in triceratops doody will love the moment when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whale snot . Most important , he has a sweet disposition  --  lets the boy stroke his tongue  --  and is fiercely loyal to his human sibling . By film 's end , a million tots in the audience will be tearfully whispering Jessie 's climactic words : " I love you , Willy . "
