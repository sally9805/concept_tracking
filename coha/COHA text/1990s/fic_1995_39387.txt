Whenever we believe that we recognize something , we are especially forgetful.  --  Franz Josef Czernin <p> 1 . <p> I want only you . PAUSE <p> Who is she ? <p> Some girl . We do n't find out her name . <p> She seems to be afraid . The way she sits on the bed , her legs drawn up , and the way the blanket covers them and is pulled up to her throat . And look at her face , it seems ... <p> It seems distorted . But that could be from having it on pause . That always causes some distortion . <p> Did he film everyone with whom he ... <p> He did n't film everyone , yet he 's the one who filmed everything . <p> Where was it filmed ? <p> In a hotel somewhere in Brazil . But let 's look at it again from the start REW . <p> 2 . <p> Back in Sao Paulo . She immediately called a friend and told her about the hotel , the beaches and the departure schedule , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , he was angry that he had n't stayed home . Lying in his room or perhaps outside in the hammock , he would rather be reading a novel undisturbed or simply closing his eyes . But he always fell for the same thing . Again and again she dragged him off to foreign scenes that , when all went well , looked exactly like the pictures in the brochures that had enticed her . He asked himself why people took such pleasure in recognizing something , even though it was the first time they saw it . Of why they believed that the sun in a different place was a different sun , or was it that when they encountered surroundings different than those at home they needed to stay on guard . But in fact , he did n't ask himself any of this . How had this vacation come about ? He said that he asked himself this later , after the return home . <p> The way she screamed . There is an expression , " screaming for joy , " as if such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parquet , he heard the slam of bedroom doors and closet doors , heard the hard rush of water from the faucet hitting the sink , he even heard how she opened her suitcase in the next room , the two quick , bright snaps when the locks sprang open . He knew he would only feel at home when she was again at work . He picked up a book that lay on his desk , holding it up to his face , and blew a sharp puff to see if any dust swirled up from it . No dust . He let the book fall open to a page . He read : Stupidity , I contend , is nothing more than blind agreement with the outward appearance of the world , and already he wished to read no further . In his room , tacked up on the wall , there hung a large map of the city of Sao Paulo . He stood before it and observed the shadow that lay on the map , a thin , meaningless , contoured shadow . He had to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was the shadow of his own head . Then he drew away , went into the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror for a long while , staring as if at a photograph . Finally , he took a shower , washing himself in an odd manner such that he avoided all contact with himself . Still wet , he lay on the bed , and after a while got up again , dressed , and for three hours played with his camcorder . He filmed every room in his small house with slow pans and carefully considered zooms , then the garden behind the house , the orchids , the hammock that he had tied between two coconut trees and finally also the street on which he lived . He placed the camcorder on top of the television , looked at the film that was running on the screen , then he taped it onto a cassette , which he later placed next to the others on the bookshelf . <p> 3 . <p> PLAY . Give me your most seductive pose . <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? That must be agony for the girl . <p> I do n't know . On the other hand , she 's going along with it . <p> There 's a lot of flirting involved . <p> You think so ? <p> Yes . <p> Someone might see . Someone might be looking . <p> But we 're alone . No one can see . <p> But maybe later . Anything that 's filmed can be played , and someone can watch . I do n't want that to happen . <p> Come on , pull away the blanket , I want to see you . <p> Turn the camera away . You can see me , you can see everything , but turn the camera away . Do you have to tape everything ? <p> A pan of the room . It is mainly decorated in red , the plush headboard of the bed , the curtains , while so much red produces a red tint to the film , a red shimmering , a chair covered in red velvet over which clothing is draped , next to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Why do you need this camera ? <p> Say : I want only you . <p> I want only you . <p> Again . More convincing . <p> I want only you . Can you turn the camera away now ? <p> Zoom in on the red high heels in front of the chair . STOP . <p> I think that 's disgusting . Can we turn it off ? Maybe we can find a tape on which he 's filmed himself . <p> He 's not on any of the tapes . He was always behind the camera . PLAY . <p> Suddenly the camera wheels much too quickly . The girl stands next to the bed , once more pressing the blanket to her body , then she lets it fall . <p> She is n't naked ! <p> What made you think that she was naked ? <p> Then the girl runs towards the camera and away , no longer in the picture , pure motion , then nothing , then the girl from behind , blurry and out of focus , the camera not having enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bathroom , the girl already standing in the tub with the shower curtain drawn . Pink plastic . The camera focuses on the shower curtain , nothing discernible , no shadow to be seen behind it , until suddenly a T-shirt sails over the curtain , a bra , jeans , panties , the camera retreating as it films the pieces of clothing that lie on the floor . The splashing of water can be heard . Pan to a bath towel that hangs on a chrome rod between the tub and sink , then zoom in at the same time that a laugh can be heard . PAUSE . The towel fills the picture . Beneath the inscription HOTEL REI MOMO the figure of an unusually fat man is embroidered , wearing an odd hat that is not immediately recognizable because of the distortion caused by freezing the picture . <p> The fat man on the hand towel looks like a Buddha with a fool 's cap . <p> That is King Momo , the king of the carnival . <p> Do you know the hotel ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 4 . <p> He had often heard ( and every time it 's told the same way ) that things happen so fast that the one who is surprised has no time to react . Then why had it gone so slowly , such that he could observe it and even react in defense ? Perhaps the initial grip was clumsy , which can easily occur when the participants , both the criminal and victim , find themselves in motion together . <p> Suddenly two young hoodlums were there , one hit him in the shoulder , the other grabbed his throat . They did it suddenly , very much a rash assault , but it seemed at the same time so slow and drawn out , as if they did n't really want to grab him and hit him , but rather they wee trying to release themselves from a tough , sticky substance that held them from behind . There was enough time to raise his arms in defense , the movement of his arms strangely slow as they hovered before the attackers , and so awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happened without a sound . Soundless , whirling movements that seemed so tranquil , and which presented their whirling like snowflakes in one of those globes that , when shaken , depicts a scene in winter . It was all he could think of despite the tropical heat . <p> Why had he in fact put up a fight ? He would not have resisted if they had tried to take the watch from his wrist or the money from his wallet . But the gold necklace with the little gold heart attached , he did n't want to give that up without a fight . As far back as he could remember he had owned this necklace and had always worn it ; it was older than his own memory , something from the time before one even begins to forget . <p> The boys fled ; had they abandoned him ? He did n't see them anymore ; he saw before him nothing but the darkness of the street . It was n't black , was n't simply nothingness ; the darkness was porous , illuminated by streetlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrank on its own , a stabbing pain at the back of his head , now complete blackness , finally nothing , at last a dreamless sleep . It was only strange that he knew that : at last a dreamless sleep . <p> Suddenly he saw something white , and he knew nothing more . A shimmering white plain , a broad crack , a hole in the blackness that stood around him like a wall . He wanted to step through it into the shining brightness . He pressed his head into this passage , pressing inward where it was soft and warm , but why was he pushed back ? He tried it again , but something pushed him back , though he did n't give up , gasping as he bore into the warm whiteness , though not gasping alone , for there was a ring of people , and he heard a voice , words that he did n't understand at first . Was it the voice that repeated the words continually , or did he repeat them himself inside his head for so long that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's okay . Everything 's okay . Wake up ! He felt pressure from behind and he returned the pressure , let himself sink back , and as he lay gasping on his back he saw a white enameled metal tube , above him a gallows  --  a gallows ? next to him a woman , a nurse , who scrupulously ran her hands over her white apron , smoothing it out with quick rubbing motions . Everything 's okay . I 'll get the doctor now . <p> The doctor gave the impression of being a happy man . With a beaming smile he said his name , appearing deeply satisfied that the patient had already regained consciousness , saying more than once , You were lucky ! consulting a radiologist 's report , Nothing serious ! he said and laughed . Now all one had to do was get everything down . He asked him what his name was , but he did n't know what his name was , where he lived , he did n't know how he had gotten the head wound , he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name in such a friendly way at the start , became angry with the patient , who seemed to be persistently keeping something to himself , and he tried once more . Again and again he asked him what his name was . He did n't know it . <p> 5 . <p> Then he was walking through the city again ; it was no longer night , but also it was n't daylight , rather the dusk of semi-consciousness . The streets were busy , he walked and walked , the hurried , purposeful movements of everyone else creating lines and rows , a thick net through which he slipped as if he were bodiless . Again and again he gripped his throat with his hand , knowing not why . What was he doing here ? Who was he ? It was unknown . It occurred to him to look through his pockets in order to look for a clue . He found a handkerchief with flecks of blood on it , some money , a half-full pack of cigarettes , a match book from a hotel , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know . Where did the flecks of blood on the handkerchief come from ? Had he had a nose bleed ? He shoved his index finger up each of his nostrils to see if they were crusted with blood . Children came up to him and laughed . Was he a smoker ? He lit a cigarette . He experienced nothing more than the fact that it felt good to smoke . Then he took off his Sakko and checked the inscribed label . The Sakko was from Paris . Was he in Paris ? <p> He looked around and recognized nothing . He was a stranger . But where ? And from where ? He closed his eyes , as if wanting to separate the night he experienced inside himself from the night that was beginning to fall over the city . Someone jostled against him . He heard someone talking so close to him that he thought he could smell their breath . He heard someone else laughing . Why ? Why did n't he know ? Why did he know nothing ? If he could at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a man who was hawking newspapers . Diario da Noite ! Diario da Noite ! To his ears it sounded like Diaranoi . He repeated it softly , Diaranoi , then repeated it a few more times , then louder : Diaranoi . He chuckled with satisfaction , as if he had suddenly learned the language of this city . Out of gratitude he bought a paper from the man . Where was this paper published ? In Sao Paulo . He was in Sao Paulo . But why ? And from where had he come ? He understood what he read in this paper , but at the same time he knew it was not his mother tongue . In what language did he think ? At the very moment he asked this , he no longer knew in what language he had thought the question , and then no more words occurred to him , only the words that he saw on the front page of the paper . He opened the newspaper . Body of a young woman found in hotel room . A grisly murder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortured , mutilated , the entire room red with blood , the identity of the murderer unknown , not a clue . Within his thoughts something was set in motion , perhaps an image , a visual memory that was trying to reach him . But it exhausted itself in having to cross such a distance and was only barely familiar . He could make out hardly anything more than a shapeless , reddish glimmer of light in which there was an incomprehensible whirling of colors that wavered , blended together , and were lost . <p> He folded the newspaper under his arm and lit another cigarette . His glance then fell upon the writing on the matchbook that he held in his hand . He was startled , stuck it quickly into his pocket , and felt the handkerchief with his hand . <p> The glimmer of light he had felt earlier now tried to reach the surface of his consciousness , and he squeezed his eyes shut with a feeling of utter panic , tried to suppress it . Back down into the darkness . He groaned aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asking him whether he was all right , meanwhile the handkerchief grew bigger and thicker in his hand . He yanked it out of his pocket , balled it with both his hands , wanting to make it very small , squeezing it , wanting to make it disappear . <p> What 's the matter ? Then the light was there . <p> 6 . <p> He knelt in bed and rubbed the blanket until he was surprised to find himself awake . Little by little he was getting used to the light as he began to not only see the things in his bedroom , but also to recognize them . <p> She had turned on the light . Wake up , what 's the matter ? she said once more . <p> I was dreaming . I was dreaming something awful . <p> With hesitation he began to tell her the dream . He began with the attack . Two boys had tried to rip the necklace from his throat . He reached for his throat ; there was the chain . He searched for the pendant until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misshapen the pendant is , one can hardly tell that it was a little heart I must have chewed on it as a child . <p> He breathed deeply , gasping for air , his chest heaving . He was still upset enough that he could hardly speak and breathe at the same time . With my baby teeth , he said , still gasping for air with a rattle in his throat . She sat there motionless with her legs crossed next to him in bed and listened . He asked himself why she made no attempt to quietly caress him , for could n't she see how bad off he was ? Then it hit him , everything that had been lost from his memory . Waking up in the hospital without knowing who he was , later running around in the city as a stranger , feeling so absolutely alien that he no longer knew anything at all . She yawned . <p> And then what happened ? <p> He looked at her and became furious , because it was obvious from the way she looked that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligated to listen to him in order to settle him down . And what did she do to try and quiet him ? Not a single gesture of tenderness , not even a soothing word  --  just a question to prod him on ! She sat there wooden , holding herself erect in a taut , disturbing pose that only demonstrated to him all the more how she tormented him by posing a question only so that he might finish all the more quickly and she could go back to sleep . He impatiently cleared his throat a couple of times and nodded his head as an indication that it really would n't last that much longer . <p> Why did you wrap the blanket around yourself that way , as if you were angry with the blanket , what were you think- ... <p> I do n't know . Maybe I was hot . The sweat of pure fear . I 'm really exhausted . Would you make me some warm milk with honey ? <p> She went into the kitchen and came back a brief moment later with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor in the kitchen was too cold . That she did n't want to stand there barefoot for so long . That during the night the cockroaches always came out . That she was afraid of them . <p> And then , as she saw how he looked at her : Drink a little water ; that will help to settle you . <p> He had the urge to throw the water in her face , to tell her to wake up . He took a sip from the glass and thought that it would be impossible to wake her . For people like her there was no such thing as a good shock . If he should leave her , she would no doubt be telling someone in her whining voice how sympathetic and tender she had been , even when he was so rude or mean , even though when he had bad dreams she was nonetheless patient and  --  was she crazy ? It was sugar water ! She had been so kind as to bring him sugar water in order to soothe him , always so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he on the other hand ... That 's the way she would tell it , and she was also firmly convinced that it was so . Still on the verge of spitting at her , he put the glass down , thanking her . She gave him a pained smile . He saw that her weariness pained her , yet she seemed self-righteous in her suffering , proving yet again that she would stay with him through thick and thin . At the same time , infantile as she was , she did not understand why things could n't be easier , for she loved being in Rio again for a weekend , having a couple of days on the beach at Barra de Una ; she loved all that , loved all situations in which he asked himself what there was to do but kill time , watch it go by and begin to sweat , while for her it was sheer happiness , and when it was perfect , when she was happy , that was when he had no nightmares , no bouts of irritation , no strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was so restless , my dear , why are you so upset , it is really so beautiful here . <p> Was that the entire dream ? <p> No , he said , although he had no more desire to relate the rest of his dream . Certainly he did n't want to say anything about buying the newspaper with the article about the murder . A murder in the hotel which they had only recently checked into  --  in Rio . She felt herself capable of suddenly screaming from within the emptiness of her obligation to listen to him , and only because she could imagine herself doing that , she suddenly began to try to think of a reason why he was upset . It was almost impossible . Sometimes people ate too late and too heavily , then they had bad dreams , though that seemed not to be the answer , or at least not an answer that explained everything . Right now what he really wanted was  --  what ? <p> And what happened then ! Did your memory return ? <p> Did my memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how dumb she really was . Since when have nightmares had a happy end ! Yes , he said , it came back ; listen , this is what happened . <p> As I was saying , I ran around without knowing who I was and where I was . Then I walked by a sidewalk cafe and decided to have a bite to eat and methodically try to remember . <p> In any case , I ordered a cup of tea and one of those little cakes that are dry as sand and which they had in the display case . I felt a jolt and suddenly a singular euphoria burst inside me . <p> I saw a gray house and its facade . I saw it as a piece of scenery from the theater . Then I saw in my imagination a small addition on the back of this house , which caused me to think of a sentence that said it was erected for my parents , and along with the house the entire city was erected , as well as the square , the square into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church . The sentences that occurred to me conveyed the feeling of something certain , yet something that really did n't connect up with the images , sentences such as clear and observable the city and the gardens rise from my cup of tea . And then I saw clearly and precisely the apartment in which I had lived as a student , seeing it in all of its particularity , and I saw myself sitting there within it and reading , a young student in Vienna who was eager and excited to devour the great novels of the world and to spend all night discussing these books with friends , and- <p> He stopped short . He saw all of it clearly before him , and also his grandmother 's house in the country where he had always spent his summer vacation . <p> And ? <p> And nothing , that was all , he said in irritation . As a result of the sudden appearance of remembered images , within which the mechanism for revealing their meaning was buried  --  I know , no , I knew once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then he said nothing more and stared at her , waiting for a reaction . He had stared in this same way as a child , on a bleak and rainy holiday , stares at a test tube into which he had poured two fluids from his chemistry set in order to see what would happen . As he thought about this , he no longer saw her , but rather himself and his odd , cold , childish mixture of curiosity and fear . Nothing had happened ; his chemistry set was one that was safe for children . <p> 7 . <p> In the German bookstores and used bookshops he bought countless books that he arranged on the shelf at home and left unread . He had already read them . He would also have liked to buy the children 's books that he could remember having read . He wanted to stand before the shelf in order to receive signals from the spines of the books about what in fact was inside his head . <p> Instead , what was gathered together in this house appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gaze . Not once did anything surprising reveal itself . <p> The distant noise of the city expressway that he had accepted as acoustic proof of his urban existence . The odors that blew in through the open window , a mixture of dead leaves , exhaust fumes and the smells of cooking , which were also exhaust fumes . Most of all , odors . The smell of alcohol in his living room and study . The cleaning lady wiped everything down with alcohol . The smell of propane in the kitchen . The mustiness of the bedroom , a result of the dampness in the air , which would permeate the robe that hung in the closet , even if it were not worn , so that it had to be washed regularly , otherwise it would become mildewed . Sao Paulo meant certain odors to him . Or a quality of light . Above all , it meant a wavering haziness , blinding and dusky at the same time . A light that lay upon the city like cellophane . He found it impossible to capture with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to very clear water I once saw a dead stag . He had been shot , a bullet hit him in the side , and he had tried to get to fresh water in order to cool his pain . But he had died at the shore . He lay there with his head resting on the sand and his front hooves stretched out into the pure water . Not a single living creature could be seen anywhere around . PAUSE . <p> What 's that supposed to mean . What 's he talking about ? <p> I do n't know . Perhaps he 's fantasizing , maybe he 's quoting from something . <p> But there 's nothing to be seen in the picture . <p> It 's not exactly nothing . There is something . But it 's hard to recognize . Perhaps a shadow or a spot . PLAY . <p> I was so taken by the animal ; I admired its beauty and felt an enormous sense of compassion for it . His eyes were just barely open . <p> The image on the screen began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective , making it possible to recognize that ... <p> Yes , it 's sand , a sandy beach . The spot is a depression , a shape in the sand . Something evidently had been lying here . <p> Or someone . But certainly not a stag . <p> Can you make it out ? <p> The camera now moved slowly around the body 's shape in the sand . The sea washed softly to the edge and back again , leaving a glittering trail . <p> It glistened with a painful brilliance and made it seem as if his countenance , which almost appeared to be speaking , was also a reproach to his murderer . <p> Then the camera turned swiftly upwards , soon people in bathing suits appeared within it , then , for a moment , the sun just above the horizon , an explosion of light , a white-gray shimmering , and suddenly the frame is black . <p> What 's wrong ? <p> I do n't know . Perhaps he 's ... <p> The stag that I saw has always hovered before my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure being . STOP . <p>  --  translated from the German by Peter Filkins <p>
