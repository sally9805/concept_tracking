<p> Last fall Matt Bialer , a book agent at William Morris , sent publishers the latest manuscript by Ed Gorman , the author of 17 works of fiction , primarily suspense novels that have had steady , if not spectacular sales . But Mr. Gorman 's newest , " The Poker Club , " which is about four card-playing professional men who accidentally kill an intruder and see their lives unravel , was turned down flat by nearly a dozen houses . <p> " People said it was a good story but it was too male-oriented , " Mr. Bialer said . " They said it needed a stronger female protagonist . " <p> Mr. Bialer was forced to recognize what many writers , agents , publishers and booksellers have come to assume : the book market these days is increasingly a woman 's market . <p> While little publicized and hard to document , it is a widely held belief in the book business that more women buy books than men  --  perhaps as much as 70 or 80 percent of fiction . And when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want are either works by female authors or  --  if the author is a man  --  then a story with a strong female central character . <p> " Authors are very aware of it , because it 's said all the time , " Mr. Bialer said . " Men have to write books that will appeal to women and that usually involves having main characters that are women . Some can do it and some ca n't . " <p> Laurence J. Kirshbaum , chairman of Time Warner Trade Publishing , whose Warner Books imprint was among those rejecting " The Poker Club , " speaks of the " feminization " of fiction publishing in the last five years . " I think of it as kind of a wave that has just risen and surged until it 's swallowed us all up , " he said . <p> The current generation of prominent female editors and authors helps reinforce the perception that fiction publishing is being feminized , as does the phenomenal ability of Oprah Winfrey to turn literary novels into best sellers by commending them to her largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an endangered species . The number of men who made it onto the New York Times hardcover fiction list in 1996 outnumbered their female counterparts 52 to 34 ; the margin differed little in 1994 and 1995 . <p> Currently , of the top 10 hardcover fiction titles on The Times 's list , seven feature female central characters : " Hornet 's Nest " by Patricia Cornwell ; " Total Control " by David Baldacci ; " Evening Class " by Maeve Bincy ; " Small Town Girl " by LaVyrle Spencer ; " Airframe " by Michael Crichton ; " The List " by Steve Martini , and " The Deep End of the Ocean " by Jacquelyn Mitchard . <p> And while an eighth , " Sole Survivor " by Dean Koontz , has a male crime reporter for a protagonist , the plot seems tailor-made to pluck at female heartstrings . The hero is trying to solve a plane crash that killed his wife and daughters . <p> Mr. Crichton and Mr. Koontz have usually specialized in what the industry calls boy books , thrillers about serial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , Mr. Crichton raised gender hackles a few years back when the technologist-hero in his best seller " Disclosure , " was a man pressing a sexual harrassment case against his female boss . But there has been a crossing-over by such authors ; in Mr. Crichton 's latest , " Airframe , " the protagonist is a woman investigating a near-disaster on an airliner . <p> " The techno-thriller has become a kind of emoto-thriller , if you will , " Mr. Kirshbaum said . " What we used to call the boy books do n't work nearly as well as they once did , except for a brief spurt at Father 's Day . " <p> Exact statistics about the sex of book buyers are hard to come by in publishing , which is notorious for the paucity of its market research . A Gallup survey for the American Booksellers Association in 1994 found that for fiction , women made up 59 percent of book buyers , and men 41 percent . For nonfiction , the breakdown was 53 percent women and 47 percent men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widening . <p> " We have fiction on one side of the store and then history and politics and biography on the other side , " said Carla Cohen , an owner of the independent bookstore Politics and Prose in Washington . " It 's like the bride and groom at the wedding . People part when they come in the door . " She estimated that 8 of 10 fiction sales were to women . <p> Still , the degree to which publishers consider female buyers when deciding which books to publish remains an open debate . <p> " I ca n't say I ever give a whole lot of thought to gender in the marketing of books , " said David Rosenthal , the publisher of Villard Books , a division of Random House . " A publisher looks for two things in a manuscript , particularly a novel . Is it a good book , and is it going to sell ? You do n't think , ' Is this book going to sell to men or women ? ' " <p> That does not stop some agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing about traditionally masculine subjects . " It 's why ' The Horse Whisperer ' goes for $3.15 million and my book by a horse player goes for $35,000 , " said Chris Calhoun , an agent with Sterling Lord Literistic . <p> " The Horse Whisperer " by Nicholas Evans , the story of a wrangler and a lonely ranch woman , set a record price for a first novel in 1994 and was bought for the movies by Robert Redford . Its appeal : a plot similar to " The Bridges of Madison County " by Robert James Waller , which became an unstoppable seller with a largely female readership . <p> The horse player book that Mr. Calhoun represented , " The Odds Must Be Crazy " by Len Ragozan , is a forthcoming handicapper 's guide to the very male world of the track . <p> However overlooked some male authors feel , there is no question that a generation of female authors has flowered in recent years , including Ann Tyler , Margaret Atwood and Jane Hamilton . <p> " When I think of the novelists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Roths and the Malamuds and the Bellows , " said Jane Rosenmann , the fortyish executive editor of Scribner . " In the last 20 years there 's been an absolute burgeoning of first-rate women writers . " <p> Ms. Rosenmann said that her decision to buy a book " always begins with reading what 's on the page , irregardless of the gender " of the author . But she added that an author 's sex " is a factor  --  yes , no question . " <p> Marcia Burch , director of marketing for Penguin Books , a subsidiary of Pearson P.L.C. , said that in meetings where editors discuss prospective manuscripts , a female author is sometimes seen as having a marketing edge . <p> " What comes up is , ' This is a great book blah , blah , blah , and it will appeal to women readers , ' " Ms. Burch said . " They 're not only saying it 's well written , but it 's an easier group to reach . " <p> Paradoxically , hard-boiled stories of sex and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " Because They Wanted To " by Mary Gaitskill and " The Kiss " by Kathryn Harrison . <p> " All of a sudden women are getting down and dirty and not apologizing for it , " said Kris Dahl , a book agent with International Creative Management , who recently sold a memoir by Kathy Dobie , which is based on an article in Harper 's magazine about being a loose girl as a teen-ager . <p> " If you 're putting out a novel , if it happens to be a book that 's sexually violent and happens to be by someone who 's incredibly young and gorgeous looking , " Ms. Dahl said , " that 's more interesting than by a guy who has a scar on his face . " <p> Publishing executives also say that women are an easier target market because there are more opportunities to reach them : through morning and daytime television appearances , for which a majority of the audience is female , and through women 's magazines , which profile more authors and circulate more widely than men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about things like books , " said Paul Slovak , vice president of publicity for Viking Penguin . <p> He cited " The Liars ' Club " by Mary Karr , a poet 's memoir of a troubled girlhood in rural Texas that became a best seller thanks in part to strong word of mouth . " Men were reading it too , but what I really noticed was that women were coming up and saying ' I really loved this book and bought five copies to give to my girlfriends , ' " Mr. Slovak said . <p> Nothing may more clearly demonstrate women 's power than Oprah 's Book Club , the most remarkable catalyst for book sales in recent memory . <p> By weaving serious fiction into the confessional fabric of her daytime talk show , Oprah Winfrey has shown an unprecedented ability to turn literary novels into best sellers . Each book she has recommended since last fall has quickly shipped about one million copies , counting both hardcover and paperback editions . <p> Of the five authors who have appeared or been taped for broadcast on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Jacquelyn Mitchard , Toni Morrison , Jane Hamilton and Ursula Hegi . The lone male , Wally Lamb , was featured for " She 's Come Undone , " the story of a woman 's traumatic passage from youth to middle age . At the time of its original publication in 1994 , some reviewers said they were stunned that a man could write in a voice so convincingly female . <p> Mr. Kirshbaum of Time Warner noted that more than three-quarters of the editorial and sales executives at his house were women , a figure not atypical in the book industry . <p> " I think it 's fair to say publishing is a business where the editors buy from their gut , " Mr. Kirshbaum said . " And if those guts are female , the odds are you 're going to be getting a greater mix of books with female sensibilities .
