<p> In 1988 , federal banking regulators issued an ultimatum to the management of the rapidly collapsing First Annapolis Savings Bank : raise millions of dollars in new investment or face immediate shutdown . <p> Scrambling to meet the deadline , the S &L's; management used what federal authorities now believe may have been an illegal plan to raise the last portion of the money needed to avert a federal takeover . The management recruited seven businessmen to buy the S &L's; stock , lent them $ 1.5 million to finance the purchase , then sold the loans to another S &L,; where they were never detected by federal regulators . <p> Federal law specifically prohibits S &Ls; from extending credit to investors to finance their own bailouts . The law is roughly analogous to a rule imposed by many banks against homeowners borrowing money for the down payment on a house . <p> The stock loans had a significant impact on the institution 's future , enabling it to stay open for two additional years and tripling the eventual cost to the taxpayers of shutting down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government projected it would cost $ 157 million to clean up the bad debt on the S &L's; books  --  $ 100 million more than specialists say it would have cost in 1988 . The S &L's; debts mounted and its assets were drained from 1988 to 1990 . <p> Investigators dissecting the affairs of failed S &Ls; across the country are uncovering many cases in which the institutions stayed alive by painting better pictures of their financial conditions than actually existed . <p> At First Annapolis , management assured federal regulators that the S &L; had raised all of the required new investment through a private stock sale . If regulators had known that part of the money had been raised through the loans , they may have seized the institution two years before its collapse , according to federal banking authorities . <p> Regulators never detected the loans because First Annapolis arranged for another S &L,; Second National Federal Savings Bank , to take over the debt as part of a loan-swapping agreement . <p> Investigators are looking at the role played in the transaction by prominent Annapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholder who also served as legal adviser , director and shareholder at Second National . On Friday , Wayson resigned from the Second National board because of the " appearance of conflicts of interest " that had been cited by federal regulators , according to board Chairman Eugene Ford . His attorney said the resignation was voluntary and was made in the best interests of the S &L.; <p> The First Annapolis loans , and the transfer that kept regulators from finding them , are now part of a broad federal investigation into possible bank fraud and other violations at the S &L.; First Annapolis was Maryland 's seventh-largest S &L,; with branches throughout Anne Arundel and Prince George 's counties . <p> The First Annapolis loans are of particular interest to a federal bank fraud task force operating out of the U.S. attorney 's office in Baltimore because of Second National 's involvement in the loan swap . The S &L; bought the stock loans after First Annapolis agreed to take over a Second National loan to one of its directors that the institution needed to get off its books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supervision and Resolution Trust Corp . are closely examining interlocking directors , officers and shareholders between the two institutions . <p> Headed by Henry A. Berliner , Second National for years has been one of the Washington area 's most politically connected S &Ls,; with a board of directors that has included Rep. Tom McMillen ( D-Md. ) and Maryland House Speaker R. Clayton Mitchell Jr . ( D-Kent ) . McMillen , a business partner of Wayson 's , left the post when he entered Congress in 1987 , and Mitchell served for about one year after his election as speaker . Berliner , a major Republican Party fund-raiser , is one of the few industry executives currently serving as an adviser to the federal agency handling the cleanup of the nation 's failed S &Ls.; <p> Specifically , investigators are looking at Wayson 's involvement in recruiting First Annapolis investors during the 1988 crisis . In all , the investors said they pumped $ 13.6 million in new funds into the S &L.; <p> Some of the seven businessmen involved in the First Annapolis loans have told federal authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them arrange loans with the institution for their stock purchases , law enforcement sources said . <p> They told authorities they were never informed that the loans could violate federal law , sources said . The men also said that Wayson negotiated the transfer of the loans to Second National . <p> Wayson , through his attorney , said he did nothing wrong in raising the money and played no role in arranging the First Annapolis loans . The attorney , Dale Cooter , also said Wayson played no role in facilitating the transfer of the loans to Second National . <p> Cooter confirmed that investors borrowed money to invest in First Annapolis , but he said that Wayson " did n't have anything to do with that . " <p> Former First Annapolis executives have declined to comment on any aspect of the federal probe . <p> The loans occurred on Aug. 12 , 1988 , after a major effort by the S &L; to find new investors through a private stock sale fell short , according to federal authorities . Regulators had warned First Annapolis that unless it raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be seized by the government , according to sources . <p> Because the stock was supposed to represent a new outside investment in First Annapolis , lending the money for the stock investment made it appear that the S &L; had more capital on hand than it actually did . As a result , regulators allowed First Annapolis to remain open . <p> Sources said regulators never detected the stock loans because in May 1989 they were traded to Second National . <p> Some of the businessmen have told federal authorities that First Annapolis sold the loans that month because the S &L's; management was concerned about regulatory scrutiny of the loans . <p> Sources said First Annapolis at the time was trying to persuade two of the businessmen who had borrowed money  --  Patrick Cole and Paul Jones  --  to join the First Annapolis Board of Directors . However , federal regulators had prohibited the S &L; from having loans outstanding to directors , and if the stock loans remained on the books , they would attract unwanted attention , the sources said . Cole and Jones eventually joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take over the stock loans after Wayson talked to senior vice president Marion Minker . Cooter said Wayson " may have had a passing conversation with somebody " at Second National about transferring the stock loans to that S &L,; " but he played no role to facilitate the transaction . " <p> But Berliner said Second National never knew  --  or cared about  --  the loans ' original purpose . <p> " That was not a relevant consideration for us , " he said . " The purpose could have been to play the Maryland lottery , we would n't have cared . Our only concern would have been the collateral . " <p> Berliner said several of the First Annapolis borrowers were already customers of his institution . He said the loans were properly secured by real estate and carried the same terms as loans for other borrowers . In addition , the loans were being paid off , he said . <p> Berliner said Wayson " had a duty as a director " to inform Second National of any opportunity to help the S &L; divest itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did was expedite the contact between the two institutions and he was n't being paid for that . . . it was his fiduciary responsibility to Second National to let us know of this opportunity , " Berliner said . <p> In exchange for accepting the First Annapolis stock loans , Second National transferred to First Annapolis one of its real estate development loans . <p> Berliner said the $ 1.9 million development loan was inherited by Second National when it acquired Brehm Federal Savings Bank . Second National could not keep the loan on its books because it had been made to George A. Purnell , who sits on the Second National board . Federal law does not allow S &Ls; to lend more than $ 100,000 to board members for commercial purposes . <p> Although Second National acquired the Purnell loan through a merger , Berliner said he expected regulators to ask him to get rid of it . <p> " It 's a routine thing for savings and loans to try and help each other out like this , " Berliner said of the loan swap . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider this if you take Mr. Purnell 's loan . That will help you and it will help us . ' " <p> The Office of Thrift Supervision is trying to determine whether Second National violated federal banking laws by exchanging loans , sources said . <p> Berliner said federal regulators have talked to him about the First Annapolis loans , but he would not comment on the specific nature of those discussions .
