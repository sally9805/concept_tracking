THIS A STORY my father told me : <p> We had horses . My dad believed that caring for horses taught lessons about responsibility and life . As soon as I was old enough , I had a pony and started learning to take care of him , to make sure his life was comfortable and pleasant . This became a daily part of my life . <p> My dad had a favorite horse , a big bay mare named Rhythm . She was bay with four black stockings . Her coat shone and so did her mane . She was a huge horse . They always talk about what a big horse Secretariat was ; Rhythm was exactly his size  --  seventeen and a half hands . <p> I never got to ride Rhythm much as a child because she was so big , but sometimes my dad would pull me up on the saddle behind him , and I remember thinking then that I was on the tallest horse there ever was in any story or anywhere . I used to think that horse was legendary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Rhythm . <p> They were both true giants to me . My dad had straight pure-silver hair , even when I was young . Although he 'd never admit it , he was enough of a dandy to allow himself the lead-in to a ducktail . My mother used to tease him about it . But we did n't tease my father much . He could be severe . He was a lawyer in a farm town , and he had a very real and immediate sense of country justice . He was fair-even today if you ask around town , people who knew him will tell you that my father was one of the fairest men alive . <p> But there 's really no other way to describe him than severe , or stern . One day I came home after messing around with Danny Wasserman and I walked in the house and my dad said , " Come with me , young man . " My dad said that , it just meant trouble . " Come with me , young man . " I walked with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed . We walked past the toolshed and the rusted and blackened burn barrel . I had no idea where we were going . He kept walking , across the back pasture , through the far gate . Bugs filled the air . My father shut the pasture gate behind us , even though the horses were in the paddock for the night . <p> We walked into the woods , along a path through the brush . Then the woods opened and a short , steep bank dropped to the river . The river was wide . and flat , brown with mud . My father reached around and grabbed me by the back of the collar and a belt loop on my trousers and threw me in the river . <p> That son of a bitch threw me in the river four times . I kept wading back to the bank and when I got close enough he 'd grab my arm up high , slap a hand on my thigh , and heave me again . As soon as I saw him move I went limp ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with my dad was put up a fight . So I let him throw me and I sat in the water until I got too cold . <p> Then I flicked the mud off my hands and waded in . Four times . By the end I was crying . I was cold and shivering , soaking wet with muddy water . It was nearly dark . I said , " Dad , I 'm getting cold . " I had no idea why he was doing this , but I knew he would be doing it until he was done . <p> I said , " All right , I 'll stay in . Is that what you want ? " <p> He said nothing ; he just stood on the bank . <p> I said , " Tell me what you want , Dad . How am I supposed to know what to do unless you tell me what you want ? " <p> Then he turned and tried to climb up the bank . His feet slipped and he almost fell , but he put his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the woods . I sat in the river and cried until I could n't hear him anymore before I got up and followed . At dinner that night my father said , " Do you know why you were punished ? " <p> I said , " No sir . " <p> He said , " Tell your mother what you did to the Wassermans ' cats . " <p> I had no choice but to tell my mother , " We did like Dad did to the kittens . " <p> What happened was Danny Wasserman and I had caught his family 's two cats and carried them to the river in a burlap sack . It was a rough time , much different than when my father had done the same with a stray litter of kittens he found in our stable . The Wassermans ' cats were full-grown and clawed me and Danny through the burlap . We took turns carrying them , each of us holding the bag with both hands at arm 's length . We added stones and dirt to the sack and threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told her Danny said they did n't want the cats anymore . I said , " We did the same thing Dad did with those kittens we did n't want down in the barn . " <p> My father said , " That was different . " <p> And I said , " How come ? " <p> My father dropped his fork , pointed at me and said , " Do n't you question me . " <p> My father was like that about everything : black and white . He showed Rhythm at the county fair , and they won showmanship-at-halter every year . He would n't braid Rhythm 's mane or tie her tail , either ; he brushed the mane all onto the left side of her neck and let her tail flow . Rhythm 's tail was full and jet black and glossy , and it looked a hundred times better than the fake tails other show people stuck up their horses ' asses . <p> That big bay mare followed Dad around the ring like a dancer . He clucked and Rhythm switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as lift his chin to stop her in her tracks , flat on all hooves . He loved that horse , but by God she did what he told her . The two of them glided around the dusty ring-the tall horse 's copper coat and black mane and my father with his silver  --  they were grand champions every year until a young girl named Jenny Birdlow beat him . <p> The Birdlow girl showed a stallion which was high-strung and spirited , and her breasts stretched her shirt at the buttons . I thought she was really something  --  I was n't quite sure what  --  until she won the grand champion ribbon . Dad never showed Rhythm again . He accepted the sherbet-green reserve-champion ribbon and pinned it to Rhythm 's halter and led her from the ring . He never said a word about it . In fact , the following spring he paid Mr. Birdlow to bring the stallion to our place for a few days to breed with Rhythm . <p> Mr. Birdlow came back for the foaling , too , and he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Birdlow and my mother even came down to the stables for a little while , but she did n't stay for all of it . Jenny Birdlow wore a red-and-white checked shirt with the tails untucked and tied so her belly showed . Mr. Birdlow leaned with his forearms on the bottom half of the stall door and I tried to do the same but ended up with the wood in my armpits . Birdlow smoked a cigarette , too , and I thought , What a stupid thing to do in a stable . <p> But nobody said anything to him about it . Jenny Birdlow stood beside her father . We were all anxious and we huddled and watched . My father knelt on the hay in the stall , with his shirt rolled up over his elbows , and stroked Rhythm 's sides . He patted her rump . The horse lay on her side , her body bulged in a long copper mound . She made my father look small , crouched at her hindquarters , but on her side , stretched and so swollen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even look much like a horse anymore , but like an entirely different kind of animal . Every time my father or Rhythm moved I could hear it in the rustle of the hay . At one point I pretended to wander over to say something to my mother . All I said was something like , " Do you think it will happen soon ? " <p> I mumbled it because everybody spoke in hushed voices while we waited . My mother said , " Soon . " <p> But then I was standing right beside Jenny Birdlow and sneaking glances at bare skin around her waist . She had jeans on and they were tight across her rear , but the waist floated loosely above her hips . When she turned her head I was quick enough to flick my eyes up to her face . Very quietly , so our parents would not hear , Jenny Birdlow said , " Have you ever seen this ? " <p> I said , " No . " <p> She whispered , " I have . It 's beautiful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things went bad , her father made her leave . It went bad quickly . My father and Mr. Birdlow recognized it at about the same time , when Rhythm worked and worked and nothing happened . Rhythm blew so hard I thought she would bleed through the nose . Her eyes bulged until they did n't look real anymore , but like gigantic brown marbles . <p> My father went in up to his elbows , trying to straighten things out . That was when my mother left . Mr. Birdlow sent Jenny with her . When Jenny tried to argue , her father said , " Goddamnit do n't you sass me . Now get up there . " <p> My father did n't make me leave . Mr. Birdlow asked my father if he thought he could save it . My father , who was on his knees and bent behind Rhythm with most of one arm up inside her , turned his head to look over his shoulder and said , " I 'm worried about my horse now . " <p> He scared me , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized something was happening that should frighten me , too , so then it did . There was black blood glistening on the hay . The whole stables smelled sticky with blood . Rhythm 's breath wheezed deep in her throat . My father worked his arm inside her . Blood squirted over his elbow . His eyes were pressed shut , and his face sweated , and his silver hair went straight even at the tips . He looked small compared to the bulk of the horse . <p> Mr. Birdlow asked , " You wan na just drag it on out ? " <p> My father 's arm slid from Rhythm and dropped to the hay . He rocked back on his heels . He said , " Hip 's broke . " <p> My father put both hands on his knees and leaned on them . Rhythm 's eyes still bulged . She was frantic , but frozen by it , motionless , except . that her nostrils shuddered . My father shuffled on his knees to the head of his horse . He gathered her ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth near it . I do n't know if he said anything . He scratched the flat bone of her forehead with the fingertips of his other hand . Then he leaned back , patted her twice on the flat of her long neck ; and the second time he pushed himself away and up . <p> He asked Mr. Birdlow , " Do this for me ? I 've had the horse a long time . " <p> My father headed for the stable door , scooped his hand to move me out in front of him . We all walked up to the house . My father stopped outside the back door to rinse his arm off at the spigot . At the house , Jenny Birdlow was in the kitchen with my mother .. Jenny dried our dishes . My father gave his shotgun and some slugs to Mr. Birdlow . Then my father went into the parlor and sat on the davenport . <p> Mr. Birdlow went out the back door . My mother stopped me from going into the parlor , said she needed help in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put them away . My mother finished with the washing and left . She went upstairs ; she went I do n't know where-she left . Jenny and I worked in the kitchen and my father sat in the parlor . He was out of sight and silent , but I could feel him , like he was standing right behind me . Jenny Birdlow said to me , " What happened ? " <p> I said , " Hip 's broke . " <p> I heard a shot . It was muffled by the buildings but clearly a shot . The screams ran right on top of the shot . They shrieked like vocal cords laid bare . Later I found out that Rhythm jerked her head and Birdlow shot her nose and mouth off . The . screams were hysterical , just raw vocal cords with the mouth shot off . <p> They came right on top of one another , the horse barely catching enough breath to scream again . Another shot popped in the barn , tiny , harmless , a firecracker under a cardboard box , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's footsteps on the floorboards . <p> It was so quiet I could feel his steps in the arches of my feet . Eventually I heard the springing screech of the screen door pulled open . I heard Mr. Birdlow say , " Jesus , Russ , I 'm sorry . " <p> I heard my father say , " I appreciate it . " <p> Mr. Birdlow said , " Jenny , honey , come out here . and wait in the truck now . " Quieter , I heard him say , " Mind if I use your spigot ? " <p> And I heard my father say , " Go ahead . " <p> I heard the screen ' door slam shut . Then my : father moving back into the parlor . I stood alone in the kitchen , I knew what had happened to Rhythm . I realized she was gone and I was heartbroken . I wanted to go to my father , and I wanted him to explain . <p> She was such a gentle horse . I wanted to know why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the parlor as quietly as I could without sneaking . My father sat on the davenport . The shotgun lay across his knees . The fingertips of both hands touched the shotgun . His head pressed into the chair back . But his eyes dropped to me . He looked right at me and tears ran all over his face . <p> I had never seen my father cry before . It was a thing that I had never thought possible . He looked right at me and wept . I could not imagine talking to him like this . He was different , I thought , as if he could n't help me with water on his face . I backed away and went out the screen door . <p> At the end of the drive I could see the red taillights of Birdlow 's pickup as they pulled onto the road ; then those were gone and it was dark . I looked down towards the stables . Thinking about the horse let me finally let go . I stood in the driveway in the dark , tasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in the air , and I cried , too . I stood in the dark and cried until ! got angry . <p> I got angry and I decided that what I was going to do about it was be a man . I was going to go down to the stables and start cleaning up the mess like a man would . I started towards the stables , deciding at every step to be a man about this . Crickets chirped all around me , some close and then others in the middle distance and even farther away . <p> The crickets seemed to me to be chirping in rhythm , and their rhythm echoed and rolled away , far into the night as if it never ended . I was halfway to the stables when I heard the back door . My father yelled out my name . I did n't stop walking . I tried to hold my voice together and answered , Yes . <p> " What are you doing ? " he asked . His voice moved nearer . <p> " Stable . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . " <p> I wanted to stop and I wanted to go on , to go to the stable on my own . But I stopped and saw a glimpse of his shirt rippling in the dark , then his silver hair , and I wanted to go on to the stable by myself , but then he was there . He touched my shoulder with his hand . He said , " You do n't have to go down there , you know . " <p> I was still crying , but I was n't going to anymore . I was n't going to wipe away the tears already on my face , but I was n't going to cry any more new ones while my father stood in front of me like this . Every single tear was going to be the last . My father 's hand tightened on my shoulder , pulled me closer , but I did n't move my feet . I let him twist my upper body . My father told me , " It was the right thing but you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was the right thing or not . The important thing was that he told me it was . And he did n't stop there ; he kept talking instead of letting the silence build again . We walked down to the paddock and leaned against the fence rails and his voice came steadily through the night . We both stared over the empty paddock , and he started telling stories , quietly . He told stories about when he was young , what it was like growing up for him . <p> He told me a story about his father . <p> <p> By JEFF HULL <p>
