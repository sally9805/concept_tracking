Not far from the center of campus at tiny Hillsdale College is a kiosk displaying these lines from St. Paul : LET US BEHAVE PROPERLY ... NOT IN CAROUSING AND DRUNKENNESS , NOT IN SEXUAL PROMISCUITY AND SENSUALITY . The words are supposed to remind the 1,150 students of their school 's rockbound commitment to morality , probity and restraint . In the 28 years that George C. Roche III was Hillsdale 's voluble president , that commitment made him a hero to American conservatives  --  that and his decision 14 years ago not to accept any federal funding or allow his students to accept federal loans , in order to avoid Washington 's guidelines on affirmative action and equal outlays for women 's sports . But students ca n't bear to go near the kiosk anymore , not since it became a gathering point for the reporters who have gone to Hillsdale to find out if Roche , campus patriarch , truculent moralist , really did carry on a 19-year affair with the wife of his son . <P> Hillsdale started to turn upside down last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself to death in a gazebo in the school 's arboretum . In the days that followed , her grieving husband George Roche IV , 44 , a lecturer in history and exercise physiology at the school , publicly accused his father of having had an affair with Lissa . He told Hillsdale 's board of trustees , and the conservative magazine National Review , that just hours before she shot herself , Lissa , editor of the school 's monthly journal of conservative thought , had gone to the hospital room where his diabetic father was being treated for an insulin reaction . Before the assembled family  --  George Roche IV , Roche and his new wife  --  Lissa allegedly announced that she had been sleeping with the elder Roche for most of her 21-year marriage to his son . Hillsdale officials say Roche denied the affair to the board , " invoking God as my witness . " Then two weeks ago , he abruptly retired , walking away from a job that made him the fifth-highest-paid college president in the country , with salary and benefits that Forbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have built a wonderful dream , " Roche said in his resignation letter . " We have proved that integrity , values and courage can still triumph in a corrupt world . " No one answered the door at Roche 's home , and he did not return calls seeking comment . <P> Roche was once something of a legend , a man who brought famous faces and fat wallets to the secluded campus 90 miles southwest of Detroit . To conservatives he was a bulwark against moral squalor and political correctness . Even liberal critics marveled at his gift for persuading donors to support him in his stand against federal money . During his time as president , he raised more than $300 million . Today Hillsdale survives mostly off interest from a $172 million endowment . It was just $4 million before Roche became president in 1971.
