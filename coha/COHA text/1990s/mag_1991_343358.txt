Antarctica has long been viewed as the remotest of continents , buried beneath millions of tons of snow and ice , miles from its nearest neighbor , and " doomed by nature . . . never once to feel the warmth of the sun 's rays , " in the words of 18th century explorer Captain James Cook . Even scientists studying the way the earth looked hundreds of millions of years ago have tended to ignore this solitary landmass . So it came as a surprise to many researchers last week when a pair of American geologists reported that Antarctica may not always have been so distant . In fact , about 570 million years ago , the scientists estimate , today 's South Pole was probably less than a thousand miles from the future site of Las Vegas . <P> The theory , presented at a meeting of the Geological Society of America in San Francisco , is the first to offer a plausible scenario for when and where the continents drifted during this critical period in the planet 's history , just as life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain the birth of the Pacific Ocean , and even point the way to valuable mineral deposits . Said co-author Ian Dalziel , from the University of Texas at Austin : " The theory gives us a new road map for the past 570 million years . " <P> Geologists have long known that 250 million years ago the continents were bunched together in a massive protocontinent , dubbed Pangea . They have also had convincing evidence  --  from the geochemical makeup of rocks at the continents ' boundaries  --  that this was not the first supercontinent in the earth 's history . But the shape of that earlier supercontinent remained mysterious . <P> Last week 's report , delivered by Dalziel and his colleague Eldridge Moores of the University of California at Davis , revealed a key piece of new evidence . On the shore of the Weddell Sea in Antarctica , the scientists had tentatively identified an ancient rock formation known as the Grenville Belt , which runs from northern Canada along the eastern seaboard and then dips out of sight in southwestern Texas . This geologic connection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks , suggests that Antarctica , as well as Australia , was shoved up against the western coast of North America late in the Precambrian period ( from 1 billion to 570 million years ago ) as part of the original supercontinent , said Dalziel . <P> The new geography could shed light on several geologic mysteries . Researchers have not yet agreed on the origin of the Pacific Ocean . Some have suggested it was formed when Siberia split off from North America ; a few even postulated it was created by the moon calving off from the earth long ago . In the new scenario , the ocean would have been created when Antarctica and Australia migrated away from North America 570 million years ago . <P> This chronology would also help explain the dawning of life on land , which occurred around the same time . The breakup of a supercontinent such as this one , scientists believe , would trigger massive flooding of the continents and the creation of shallow coastal waters  --  exactly the kind of spawning ground from which sea creatures first emerged and adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
