<p> While many of their fellow Brown University graduates headed for Wall Street eight years ago , Tom First and Tom Scott retreated to Nantucket to loll on Mr. Scott 's 22-foot Boston Whaler and work odd jobs like tending bar , shucking scallops and even shampooing dogs to pay their rent . <p> It was hardly a textbook formula for getting ahead . Yet , from those inauspicious beginnings , the two wharf rats somehow stumbled into one of the entrepreneurial success stories of the mid-1990 's . Today , they reign over a $60 million " new age " juice-drink empire , Nantucket Nectars , a start-up that some people liken to the early days of Ben &; Jerry 's . <p> And in contrast to so many entrepreneurs who expound upon their savvy in achieving fortune and fame , Mr. First and Mr. Scott , both 31 , merrily confess they have little clue how they did it . " We did n't know what we were doing , " Mr. Scott said . " We did n't know how bad things were . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom and Tom , as they call themselves on their labels , cannily took a strikingly simple idea to build a strong niche for themselves in a highly competitive market where giants like Coca-Cola and Tropicana are always throwing their weight around . <p> The speed with which they succeeded stands in contrast to the arduous struggles most starting entrepreneurs endure as they fight off creditors and grapple with the strains of growth . By one estimate , only half of the hundreds of thousands of new businesses started annually survive more than five years . In the face of such discouragement , the Nantucket Nectars story stands out as a sort of lighthouse beacon . <p> Both men like to point out that they never took a business course in college and actually failed accounting . Mr. Scott says he " still is n't sure " what investment banking is . And indeed , their company , Nantucket Allserve Inc. , was born on a whim : for a Nantucket cooking contest , Mr. First tried to recreate a peach drink he had sampled in Spain . He mixed sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize . Soon , the two Toms were selling the concoction off Mr. Scott 's boat , along with ice , beer and groceries . <p> They figured they had found a perfect life : blend juice in the sunshine , spend days on the water and never have to leave their idyllic island . <p> No such luck . The peach nectar was such a hit that they could not resist the temptation to branch out to lemonade and other blends , selling them in recycled wine bottles for $1 each . At first , their biggest decision was which setting to use on their seven-speed Hamilton Beach blender . " We used to ' chop , ' and then we switched over to ' liquefy ' when we figured out we were making liquid , " Mr. First said . <p> As sales picked up , they set up shop in a converted ice house they dubbed the Allserve General Store , paid a New York bottler to produce their drinks and expanded their distribution to Martha 's Vineyard and the much more populous Cape Cod . <p> Profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Scott said that he slept in his car for the better part of a year , and at one point both men were out of money and almost out of faith . <p> But the odd jobs they did led to their biggest break . One yacht they cleaned was owned by Michael Egan , who ran the Alamo car rental company . Mr. Egan has very deep pockets  --  when Republic Industries bought Alamo this year for $625 million , his 94 percent stake was worth $587 million . When Mr. First called him for support in 1993 , Mr. Egan saw another good investment in the industrious deck-scrubbers . <p> Mr. Egan said he was getting several investment requests each week and dismissed most . <p> " You find all kinds of people starting businesses who you know do n't have a prayer of being in business in three years , but these guys were just personally attractive , very hard working , dedicated , visionary and so on , " he said . <p> " Really , when you invest in a business , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the people . " In fact , the product initially left him unimpressed . <p> " The juice was n't actually too good , " Mr. Egan said . " They had some flavors that were horrible . They had this bayberry tea that had to be about the worst-tasting snake oil elixir you could find and put in a bottle . " <p> Still , Mr. Egan paid the two Toms $500,000 for a half-stake in their tiny company , giving them plenty of room to make mistakes . <p> At first , big choices were made with short-sighted logic . Tom First recalled the debate over switching their beverages to 17.5-ounce bottles , instead of the 16-ounce industry standard . " Tom said , ' I think we should be bigger than 16 , ' " Mr. First recalled . " And I said , ' Yeah , go with it . ' " Today , they also have 12-ounce and 32-ounce sizes , but the 17.5-ounce model is their best seller . <p> In another move , the partners decided to use cane sugar , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only certain bottlers can handle cane , the choice helped distinguish their brand . They also flouted conventional wisdom by introducing a guava drink that everyone warned them would not sell . It did , though , and still does . <p> Since the beverage giants dominated the shelf space in supermarket and convenience stores , Nantucket Nectars salesmen begged mom-and-pop stores to stock their bottles . The two Toms took part in the effort with their usual ineptitude . In fact , their bumbling manner was part of their appeal . The partners did most of their advertising on the radio , with commercials pieced together from hours of ad-libbing in the studio . <p> Playing on their early days , Tom and Tom invented a slogan that they used on their radio spots and plastered on the bottle labels : " We 're Juice Guys . We do n't wear ties to work . " To accentuate the folksy image , they sent promoters across the country in purple Winnebagos giving out free samples and inscribed their bottle caps with Nantucket trivia . <p> Even when they goofed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chalk it up as a learning experience . Soon after moving their company to the Boston area in 1992 , employees stole more than $100,000 in merchandise from a warehouse before they noticed . " We were just clueless , " Mr. First said . <p> Some of their marketing ideas failed . One advertising slogan , " We knew you 'd be back , " turned customers off . " That one backfired , " admitted Wink Mleczko , Nantucket 's director of public relations . <p> And doing their own distribution turned into a disastrous undertaking that bled $1 million in 1994 . <p> That fall they dismantled their in-house distribution operation and hired outsiders to do the job . <p> In a single stroke , they eliminated their biggest cash drain and cleared the decks to focus on new products . The next year , they recorded sales of $15 million , up from $6 million in 1994 and just $1 million in 1993 . They racked up their first substantial profit in 1995 of $225,000 , according to an outside estimate . ( While they tell their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other prerogatives of a private company . ) <p> Last year , revenue shot up 200 percent to an estimated $30 million , pretax profits more than doubled to $600,000 , and Inc. magazine , the small-business bible , listed Nantucket Nectars as one of the 20-fastest-growing private companies in America . This year , sales are projected to double again to $60 million . Today , Nantucket Allserve counts 100 employees , bottling plants in California , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island and Florida and a headquarters in Cambridge , Mass . It also runs a Juice Guys juice bar in Nantucket , a prototype for others they plan to open across the country . <p> Nantucket Nectars makes 33 flavors , ranging from a simple apple juice to Ginkgo Mango . The drinks are available in 28 states  --  lacking a strong presence only in the Sun Belt and Midwest  --  as well as Latin America , France and Britain . And last week , it shipped its first batch of juices to Starbucks , the coffee-bar chain , which will sell them in about 200 of its East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $5.8 billion " new age " beverage bucket . Analysts say it faces formidable challenges , including the risk that consumers will tire of juice potions and the certainty of stiff competition from the beverage giants . John Sicher , editor and publisher of Beverage Digest magazine , for example , said that both Coca-Cola and Pepsico are testing " cold-filled " juice drinks that could steal business from companies like Nantucket Nectars that pasteurize their drinks . <p> Even so , Nantucket Nectars is thriving while others stumble . New- age drinks , which took off early in the decade , have slowed their growth , from an 18 percent volume increase in 1995 , to less than half that in 1996 . Snapple Beverages recorded a 13 percent decline in volume during that period . That brand 's checkered history in recent years illustrates the difficulty of competing in such a saturated market ; it has lost half its market share since 1993 , and it became an enormous albatross for the Quaker Oats Company , which purchased it in 1994 for $1.4 billion and sold it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sales by Arizona Iced Tea , owned by Ferolito Vultaggio &; Sons , fell 4.9 percent last year to $337 million , while those of Veryfine declined 4 percent to $125 million . <p> Mr. First and Mr. Scott , meantime , have spoken at business schools and forums , yet make no pretense of doling out universal business wisdom . " All we can tell you is our experience , " Mr. Scott tells his audiences . And even Inc. , which has booked them for two seminars , acknowledges the talks are short on practical advice . <p> The two Toms seem determined to keep the breezy Nantucket attitude . Typical attire at the headquarters in a former Harvard University fraternity house is shorts and Keds . Employees bring their dogs to work . Lorianne Brasseur , in charge of new flavors , pasteurizes her prototypes in the lunchroom microwave . <p> " You can almost bring up any idea and your opinion is valued , " said Ken Traenkle , the national sales manager who at 32 is considered something of an elder statesman . " With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , a committee discusses it , and a year later they 'll come back with a feasibility study . " <p> With their success , Mr. Scott and Mr. First said they worry that somehow control of their company will slip away from them . " We still have nights where we do n't sleep , " Mr. First said , " because we 're still afraid of losing it all . " <p> Graph : " Nantucket Nectars ' Sales Are Soaring . . .
