Section : THE INTER-AMERICAN SYSTEM <p> On January 8 , 1991 Belize and Guyana were ratified as the thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth members of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) , at a Special Session of the OAS General Assembly . <p> The Charter of the Organization was signed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belize , Said Musa , and the Attorney General and Minister of Legal Affairs of Guyana , Keith Massiah , in the presence of OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena Soares . <p> Ambassador Baena Soares stated that " the admission of Belize and Guyana as full-fledged members of the Organization of American States is a reason for the Secretary General to rejoice . It is a demonstration of the continuous relevance of the OAS as the forum for dialogue and agreement among American countries . " He went on to point out that " the oldest international organization now has as members all the countries in the continent . This strengthens its role of promoting security , economic progress and social justice for the peoples of the Hemisphere . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Assembly " this marks an important milestone in the political life of the sovereign nation of Belize . Today , we join and are accepted into the great family of Western Hemisphere Nations , the Organization of American States . " Attorney General Massiah , of Guyana , remarked " today marks the culmination of Guyana 's diplomatic efforts to have its right to membership of this Organization and to participate in arrangements within the Inter-American System , fully acknowledged . " GUYANA : LAND OF MANY WATERS <p> Located on the littoral of South America between Suriname on the east , Brazil on the south and Venezuela on the west and with its northern shores carressed by the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean , is the Republic of Guyana . Guyana is a relatively small developing country of 83,000 square miles . Better known in the history books as " Demerara " or " British Guiana , " Guyana has a multi-ethnic population of just over 800,000 people which reflects the country 's immigrant history . <p> The largest ethnic group is the descendants of the East Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were brought as slaves from West Africa , comprise the next largest ethnic group . Other significant groups are the native Amerindians , ( who it is believed , came originally from Mongolia ) Chinese and Europeans , many of the latter being of Portuguese extraction . Like the Indians and the Chinese , the Portuguese who came to " Demerara " mainly from Madeira , the Azores and Cape Verde , were indentured labourers . During colonial rule they were regarded as separate and apart from other Europeans because of their indentured status . Due to many years of interracial marriage , a large segment of Guyana 's population today is racially and ethnically mixed . <p> The name " Guyana " is derived from an Amerindian word which means " land of many waters . " It is certainly an apt description of this sub-tropical country with its intricate network of rivers , streams , numerous rapids and waterfalls . Among the more notable of its waterways is the so-called Hot and Cold Lake which is one body of water in which the temperature varies from extreme hot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls where the continuous perpendicular drop of a large volume of water for 741 feet makes it the highest waterfall in the world . <p> Georgetown is the capital city of Guyana . It is a port city and the main commercial and administrative center of the country . With a checker-board street layout , tree-lined avenues , well manicured parapets and an interesting mix of architectural designs , Georgetown has often been referred to as the " Garden City of the Caribbean . " It is an accolade of which all Guyanese are proud . <p> Although Guyana is geographically a South American nation , it has always been historically , politically and culturally linked to the English-speaking Caribbean . The official language is English , making Guyana the only English-speaking country on the continent . An English-based Creole dialect called Creolese is widely used as an informal means of communication . The indigenous Amerindians have maintained their many dialects , while Hindi and Urdu are used almost exclusively for religious purposes by Hindus and Muslims respectively . <p> The earliest records of Guyana 's history date to the sixteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled by the Dutch in the seventeenth century , there was a succession of conflicts among the Dutch , the French and the British for outright possession of the then colonies of Essequibo , Demerara and Berbice which today comprise the three counties of Guyana . In 1814 , these three colonies were ceded to the British who , in 1831 , merged them into one colony which they called British Guiana . Guyana gained her independence from Britain in 1966 and in 1970 became a Republic within the British Commonwealth of Nations . Guyana is one of the Charter Members of the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) . BELIZE : BEACON OF HARMONY <p> For over 4,000 years , Belize was part of a major trade route in the Mayan empire . The Mayan culture persisted even as the first shipwrecked British pirates landed and began converting the region 's vast mahogony forests into a thriving lumber industry to meet the European demand for tropical wood . After defeating several Spanish attempts to claim the country , British control gradually increased and Belize , then known as British Honduras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional independence in 1981 , 160 years after the rest of Central America . Tourism and agriculture are top priorities in Belize and the government is committed to strong conservation measures to preserve the country 's natural treasures and heritage . <p> Tucked between Mexico and Guatemala , this English-speaking country comprises 9,000 square miles of spectacular beauty , both inland and along the coast . The capital city , Belmopan , is located 50 miles west of Belize City , which is the site of the international airport and home to about one-third of the country 's 175,000 residents . Belize is also the gateway to the country 's beautiful island Cayes . The Cayes are part of a 176 mile barrier reef , second largest only to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia . Ambergris Caye is the most developed of the islands , with San Pedro its seaside hub . <p> Although the official language is English , a lyrical Caribbean-sounding version of " broken English " has evolved with the Creole culture . The Creole population is a mixture of the many distinct ethnic groups in Belize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk-wisdom . " Wen fish co(me) fram riva-batam an ' tell you haligetta gat pain-a-belly , belive a(m) " ( When a fish comes from the river bottom and tells you the alligator has a belly-ache , believe it ) , generally means that information obtained from a person in the know is likely to be true . " Two stick grow da bush ; one grow straight , one grow crooked " is generally understood to mean that people are inexplicably different . <p> The origin of the name " Belize " is still uncertain . Some say it is a derivation of the Mayan word " beliz " meaning " muddy river . " Others speculate that it is a corruption of the name Peter Wallace , the notorious buccaneer who founded the first settlement ; but more likely it is the adaptation of the French word " balise , " meaning " beacon . " <p> What is certain is that Belize has been a beacon welcoming diverse peoples who find racial harmony , relgious freedom and peaceful living within its borders . <p> MAP <p> PHOTO ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide and four times higher than Niagara Falls in the U.S. <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The variety of architectural styles in Georgetown , Guyana 's capital , reflects the intermingling of many cultures .
