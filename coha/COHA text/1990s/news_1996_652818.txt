<p> Kurt Masur was facing the music , and sweet music it was . When the maestro of the New York Philharmonic , flanked by his managerial partner and sometime nemesis , Deborah Borda , engaged the public at a question-and-answer session in Avery Fisher Hall this month , the sole critique came from a subscriber who asked why the players had treated rapturous audiences in Europe this summer to repeated encores while , he complained , " I applaud and cheer and never manage to elicit an encore . " <p> When the approving laughter subsided , Mr. Masur replied that out-of-town audiences so rarely hear the Philharmonic that they deserve " sometimes a candy , a nice dessert . " Before the end of the convivial session , he offered his hometown fans a bonbon as well : the orchestra , he said , has been looking at the Seventh Regiment Armory on the East Side of Manhattan as a possible long-sought summer home for rollicking and informal concerts . <p> It is in many ways a propitious time for the Philharmonic , now into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its rigorous 69-year-old German music director , once at odds , have formed a close bond . They have earned some of the best reviews in years and have won the Philharmonic mention among the world 's highest-ranked orchestras , if also prompting some critics to carp that its polish is achieved through artistic conservatism . <p> It has also balanced its budget for three years and has been filling the house to an average of 94 percent of capacity . <p> But behind the scenes , the mood has been soured by ill-concealed rivalries between Mr. Masur and Ms. Borda , the executive director , in a struggle that intimates of the orchestra say played a role in a recent shake-up of the board . <p> The season was barely under way , in fact , when Mr. Masur went to the committee representing the musicians to complain that Ms. Borda was trying to drive a wedge between him and the players . There is also open disparagement of Ms. Borda by many of the musicians , still seething over what they call insulting treatment in the cliffhanger contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter strike now afflicting the Philadelphia and Atlanta orchestras . They also say she misrepresented the recent agreement to revive live radio broadcasts by the Philharmonic . <p> " Look , it is like a marriage , ja ? " Mr. Masur said in an interview , declining to spell out his complaints . <p> Ms. Borda , in a separate interview , said , " Sure there are tensions . " But she said that despite a recent feeler from the Los Angeles Philharmonic , she would stay on , dismissing talk of her departure as the work of industry rumormongers whom she called " the 57th Street tom-toms . " <p> Neither Mr. Masur nor Ms. Borda is going to leave , said Paul B. Guenther , former president of the Paine Webber Group , who was named chairman of the Philharmonic last month . " We 're firmly committed to both of them , " he said . " He does his job . She does her job . " Mr. Masur is paid $1.2 million a year ; Ms. Borda $330,000 . <p> Musicians who spoke on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of two finalists being considered for president of the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston , where she studied the viola , and that she was scheduled for another interview tomorrow . <p> Relaxing in his Lincoln Center office shortly before leaving for Leipzig , Germany , where he is also director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra , Mr. Masur played down talk of a rift . He said he could barely wait to play through the few remaining new works commissioned by his predecessor , Zubin Mehta , so he could order his own . <p> In any case , Mr. Masur will soon have more time to devote to the Philharmonic . January will mark the end of his 26-year leadership of the Gewandhaus , which he said he was giving up earlier than expected , in dismay over dwindling state support , although he would still make guest appearances . <p> The Philharmonic , to which he is scheduled to return a few days before Thanksgiving , will remain his only regular podium , he said , adding , " No , I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will fill out his time being a guest conductor and attending to what he called " my first love " : opera , including perhaps a debut with the Metropolitan Opera . Mr. Masur said he would be eager " to make an exchange " and occasionally switch podiums with James Levine . <p> Meanwhile , he said , he was stepping up the long and so far fruitless quest for a summer home for the Philharmonic , a search that focused for a time on the State University College at Purchase in Westchester County and has now led to the Seventh Regiment Armory at Park Avenue and 66th Street . The Municipal Art Society has been studying new uses for the block-square arena . It is often filled with art and antique shows , but in the 1880 's it was a Philharmonic concert hall . <p> Mr. Masur said he had in mind a New York counterpart to the hugely popular BBC Proms summer concerts in Royal Albert Hall in London , where standees pack the floor for what is billed as " the greatest musical festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Municipal Art Society , confirmed that discussions with the Philharmonic were proceeding . He said that the veterans unit that owns the fortress had asked the society last year to come up with a new plan for its use and that the Philharmonic so far seemed the most promising match . But he said that any plan would require the approval of the city and the New York State Bureau of Military and Naval Affairs . <p> By many measures of today 's struggling orchestras , the Philharmonic , the nation 's oldest , founded in 1842 , is doing enviably well . The orchestra 's endowment , the nation 's biggest at about $130 million , is healthily quadruple its $32 million annual budget , of which barely 1 percent comes from the city and state . With a 35-week subscription season , longest of any orchestra in the nation , it is playing 130 subscription concerts in 1996-97 ( not counting a handful of special events and youth and parks concerts ) , and should sell nearly 239,000 seats , or 67 percent , to subscription buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a town where the Philharmonic frequently faces tough competition from touring rivals . <p> Musically , the Philharmonic has gained excellent notices , particularly on its nine-city European summer tour . Even by standards of the exaggerated hospitality of foreign audiences , the welcomes were often ecstatic . Reviewing the season-opening concert of Brahms and Tchaikovsky , Bernard Holland , chief music critic of The New York Times , compared the orchestra to the exalted Berlin Philharmonic , saying that both conveyed " unlimited potential and an amazing malleability " while also saying that Mr. Masur had not been pushing the orchestra as far as it might go . <p> But the happy results mask underlying tensions . In Berlin this summer , orchestra members said , the Philharmonic 's popular departing board chairman , Stephen Stamas  --  a strong ally of Mr. Masur and the players  --  threw a farewell party with tributes that pointedly omitted Ms. Borda , who did not speak . In Edinburgh , Ms. Borda gave a newspaper interview that infuriated Mr. Masur with its claims of credit for shaping up the orchestra . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their disagreements , " I learned to live with the Stasi in our country and this does n't frighten me . " The Stasi was the secret police in East Germany . <p> Ms. Borda , who was an orchestra administrator in San Francisco , Minneapolis and Detroit before coming to New York in 1991 , said she wondered whether " the spotlight has been turned on me because I 'm a woman . " Asked whether she felt she had worked to empower the players only to find them turning their authority against her , she said , " That 's a good question . " <p> According to orchestra members and officials who spoke on condition of anonymity , after Mr. Stamas and the board 's longtime president , H. Frederick Krimendahl 2d , announced their intention last June to step down , the board kept the succession from partisans of Ms. Borda , including a fellow board member , Rita E. Hauser , an international lawyer and a former United States delegate to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights . The jobs were consolidated into one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masur or Ms. Borda . At the same time , the board 's decision-making core was cut to Mr. Guenther and the five members of the orchestra 's selection committee . <p> Ms. Borda acknowledged that the players seemed concerned that Ms. Hauser would wind up as chairman . When word came that the board had made its choice , Ms. Borda joked , " the orchestra said , ' Is it the woman ? ' " <p> Ms. Hauser said in an interview that she was too busy to take on the chairmanship . She praised Ms. Borda for carrying out the wishes of the board and providing a prudent counterweight to " what the maestro wants to do  --  everything under the sun . " <p> " Kurt is from a different tradition , " she said . " At the Gewandhaus , he ran everything . This is not East Germany in any way . " <p> The players , meanwhile , make little secret of their distaste for Ms. Borda . " We do have problems with Deborah Borda , " said Fiona Simon , a violinist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Masur 's complaints , she said , " The orchestra does n't have a lot of confidence in Deborah Borda . " <p> Ms. Borda shrugs off such complaints . " Somebody 's got to be blamed , " she said .
