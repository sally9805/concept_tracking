Most of the 10 million Americans whose shoulders have sprouted camcorders over the past five years are happy just to point their whirring lenses at anything that moves  --  drooling babies , blushing brides , cops beating up the citizenry . But in the great rush to see their lives replayed on TV , who can be bothered to edit the gems they have recorded ? Result : the world 's greatest collection of truly awful videotapes  --  a vast library of raw footage even more droning and banal than the reality it purports to document . <P> There is , however , among the vast majority of mindless " cammers , " a rare but growing breed of dedicated enthusiasts who are not content simply to point and shoot . Weighed down with auxiliary lights , remote microphones and jury- rigged dollies , they do n't just videotape weddings ( or birthdays or bar mitzvahs ) , they choreograph them . Then , back in their basement studios , they process their footage through an array of cutting-edge technology to produce video that is just as polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fraction of the cost . <P> They are called the video hackers , and they are quickly becoming as expert in the arcana of videotape as computer hackers are in the world of bits and bytes . In fact , many video hackers have mastered both worlds , plugging their camcorders into computers to explore a burgeoning new field known variously as computer video , desktop video or multimedia TV . <P> The road to hackerdom starts modestly enough . All anyone really needs for editing videotape is a camcorder and a VCR to copy selected segments from one tape onto another . Unfortunately , most camcorders and VCRs intersperse their cuts with irritating patches of electronic noise and make duplicates that look as if they 've been smeared with a video paintbrush . So the would-be video artist soon finds himself trading in his primitive equipment for improved models ( costing up to $1,200 ) with " flying erase heads , " which allow smooth splicing , and one of the new formats ( Hi8 or S-VHS ) that can be duplicated again and again . <P> But editing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's where the computers come in . With an automated editing machine  --  like Videonics ' $599 DirectED PLUS  --  instructions for making cuts can be punched into a keyboard as the footage rolls by on a TV screen . The computer remembers the markings , and when the tape is played again , the machine automatically splices together the chosen sequences . Computers can also be used to generate titles , graphics and fancy scene shifts  --  like the " tumble , " in which one image seems to turn over to reveal another . <P> The big news at the moment is NewTek 's Video Toaster , a $1,595 plug-in board that attaches to Commodore 's video-friendly Amiga computer . It gives operators a " frame grabber " to freeze images for computer manipulation , an animation program to create flying 3-D titles and a long menu of digital effects like the Star Trekkian " transporter " that can dematerialize people from the screen . <P> To capture wide-ranging action , there 's Cinema Products ' Steadicam JR , a $595 counterbalance that hangs off the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photography buffs will appreciate the new camcorders that can use a variety of lenses , including most of the wide-angle and telephoto lenses made for 35-mm still cameras .
