Just when summer should have been coming in , it snowed last week in Colorado , punctuating several days of unseasonable 32 degrees C ( 90 degrees F ) weather with enough snowfall to close three mountain highways . Paris was hit with a torrential rainstorm  --  the worst in a decade  --  that crippled the city , poisoned the Seine with sewer effluent , and clogged the river with 300 tons of dead fish . In one hour in early May , a squall dumped a record 110 mm ( 4 1/3 in. ) of rain on Hong Kong , turning steep city streets into rushing rivers and killing five . In the Middle East this January , the wettest , coldest winter in recent memory was capped by a storm that blanketed Amman , Damascus and Jerusalem with much more snow than anyone there had seen for 40 years . <P> If it continues as it has begun , 1992 could turn out to be almost as bizarre as 1991 , a year in which North America 's spring arrived in winter , its summer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 1991 to March 1992 has already gone into the National Weather Service 's record books as the warmest winter in at least 97 years . It hardly rained at all in rainy Seattle in May . Texas in January was swamped with twice as much precipitation as normal , and Southern California , where it never rains , was socked with floodwaters so powerful they carried cars out to sea . Africa is having its worst drought in 50 years , and eastern Australia , which is supposed to have summer when the northern hemisphere has winter , had to do without this year . Instead of balmy days and bright sunshine , Melbourne racked up a record 12 consecutive days of rain and the coldest January in 137 years , which is as far back as anyone Down Under kept track . <P> What is going on ? Experts say fluctuations from normal readings are , well , normal and that weird weather is the rule , not the exception . But the highs and lows and wets and drys over the past two years have been so extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wacky weather be related to those fires from the gulf war ? That hole in the ozone layer ? The global warming trend that environmentalists have been predicting for so many years ? <P> The questions are more than idle speculation . This week at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , world leaders will be adding their signatures to a treaty to prevent climate change , a document that was significantly weakened during presummit negotiations , in part because of U.S. contentions that the threat of global warming has been overblown . But the Bush Administration 's skepticism must contend with the direct experience of millions of citizens who are worried that when the weather gets as odd as it has been of late , something must be wrong . <P> Scientists , however , are more cautious than the umbrella-carrying public . Even climatologists who believe that global warming may eventually trigger extreme weather variations like the ones we are experiencing say it is too early to prove a direct connection . The outbreak of freakish weather could also have been partly caused by one or more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspects , in descending order of likelihood :
