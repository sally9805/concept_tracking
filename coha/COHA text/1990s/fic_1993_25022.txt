 | " We may not have enough masks , " I said , looking at the diminishing stacks of good equipment . Sean glared over his shoulder , pressed for time and very unhappy . " Your advice is not necessary , " Gretyl told me sharply . " It 's nothing , " Charles said , tugging my arm . " Let them work . " I shrugged his fingers loose and backed away , face flushed with embarrassment . Charles returned with me to the heater , but we had lost our places there . The lights had been cut to half . The air became thicker and colder each day . I thought of my warren rooms at home , a thousand kilometers away , of how worried my folks might be , and of how they would take it if I died out in the thin air , or if some Statist thug pierced my young frame with a flechette . . . God , what a scandal that would make ! It seemed almost worth it . I fantasized Dauble and Connor dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth my death . . . but probably not . " I 'm a physics major , " Charles said , joining me at the end of the line . " Good for you , " I said . " You 're in govmanagement ? " " That 's why I 'm here . " " I 'm here because my parents voted against the Statists . That 's all I can figure . They were in Klein BM . Klein 's holding out to the last , you know . " I nodded without making eye contact , wanting him to go away . " The Statists are suicidal , " Charles said mildly . " They 'll bring themselves down . . . even if we do n't accelerate the process . " " We ca n't afford to wait , " I said . The skinseal would n't last much longer . The nakedness and embarrassment had bonded us . We knew each other ; we thought we had no secrets . But we itched and stank and our indignation might soon give way to general disgruntlement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . " I was trying to get a scholarship for Earth study and a grant for thinker time , " he said . " Now I 'm off the list , I 'm behind on my re-search ? " He paused , eyes downcast , as if embarrassed at babbling . " You know , " he said , " we 've got to do something in the next twenty hours . The skinseal will rot . " " Right . " I looked at him more closely . He was not homely . His voice was mellow and pleasant , and what I had first judged as lack of enthusiasm now looked more like calm , which I was certainly not . Sean had finished weeding out the bad helmets . He stood and Gretyl  | called shrilly for our attention . " Listen , " Sean said , shaking out his stiff arms and shoulders . " We 've had a response from Connor 's office . They refuse to meet with us , and they demand to know where we are . I think even Connor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . So it 's now or never . We have twenty-six good outfits and eight or ten problem pieces . I can salvage two from those . The rest are junk . " " I could fix some of them if he 'd let me , " Charles said under his breath . " Gretyl and I will wear the problem pieces , " Sean said . My heart pumped faster at his selfless courage . " But that means most of us will have to stay here . We 'll draw sticks to see who crosses the plain . " " What if they 're armed ? " asked a nervous young woman . Sean smiled . " Red rabbits down , cause up like a rocket , " he said . That was clear enough . Martians shoot Martians , and glory to us all , the Statists would fall . He was right , of course . News would cross the Triple by day 's end , probably even reach the planetoid communities . Sean sounded as if he thought martyrdom might be useful . I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or ten  --  my age  --  almost nineteen Terrestrial years  --  and then at Sean 's face , seemingly old and experienced at twelve . Quietly , as a group , we raised our hands with fingers spread wide  --  the old Lunar Independence Symbol for the free expression of human abilities and ideas , tolerance against oppression , handshake instead of fist . But as Sean brought his hand down , it closed reflexively into a fist . I realized then how earnest he was , and how serious this was , and what I was putting on the line . We drew fibers from a frayed length of old optic cord an hour after the mask count . Twenty-six had been cut long . I drew a long , as did Charles . Diane was very disappointed to get a short . We were issued masks and set our personal slates to encrypt signals tied to Sean 's and Gretyl 's code numbers . We had already gone over and over the plan . Twenty would cross the surface directly above the tunnels leading back to UMS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures about five kilometers from our trench domes . The remaining students  --  two teams of four each , Charles among them , under Sean 's command  --  would fan out to key points and wait for a signal from Gretyl , the leader of our team of twenty , that we had made it to the administration chambers . If we met resistance and were not allowed to present demands to  | Connor personally , then Sean ' s teams would do their stuff . First , they would broadcast an illegal preemptive signal to the satcom at Marsynch , forcing on all bands the news that action in the name of contractual fulfillment was being taken by the voided students of UMS . Contractual fulfillment meant a lot even under the Statist experiment ; it was the foundation of every family 's existence , a sacred kind of thing . Where Sean had gotten the expertise and equipment to send a preemptive signal , he would not say ; I found his deepening mystery even more attrac-tive . Sean would personally take one team of four to the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few custom-curved maglev rods ; trains would n't be able to go to the UMS terminal until a repair car had manufactured new rods , which would take several hours . UMS would be iso-lated . Simultaneously , the second team of four  --  to which Charles was as-signed  --  would break seals and pump oxidant sizzle  --  a corrosive flopsand common in this region  --  into the university 's net optic and satcom uplink facilities . That would break all the broad corn between UMS and the rest of Mars . Private corn would go through , but all broadband research and data links and library rentals would stop dead .. . UMS might lose three or four million Triple dollars before the links could be repaired . That of course would make them angry . We waited in two lines spiraling from the center of the main trench dome . At the outside of the spiral lines , Sean and Gretyl stood silent , jaws clenched . Some students shook their red-sealed hands to get ready for the cold . Skinseal was n't made to keep you cozy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skinseal had come loose at the joints and sweat was pooling before being processed by the nanomer . I had to go to the bathroom , more out of nerves than necessity ; my feet and legs had swollen , but only a little ; I was not miserable but the petty discomforts distracted me from the focus I needed to keep from turning into a quivering heap . " Listen , " Sean said loudly , standing on a box to peer over our heads . " None of us knew what we 'd be getting into when we started all this . We do n't know what 's going to happen in the next few hours . But we all share a common goal  --  freedom to pursue our education without political interference  --  freedom to stand clear of the sins of our parents and grandparents . That 's what Mars is all about  --  something new , a grand  | experiment . We ' 11 be a part of that experiment now , or by God , we 'll die trying . " I swallowed hard and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered if he still had his calm smile . " May it not come to that , " Gretyl said . " Amen , " said someone behind me . Sean looked fully charged , face muscles sharply defined within a little oval of unsealed skin around his eyes , nose and mouth . " Let 's go , " he said . In groups of five , we removed our clothes , folding them neatly or just dropping them . The first to go entered the airlock , cycled through , and climbed the ladder . When my turn came , I crowded into the lock with five others , held my breath against the swirling red smear , and slipped on my mask and cycler . The old mask smelled doggy . Its edges adhered to the skinseal with the sound of a prim kiss . I heard the whine of pumps pulling back the air . The skinseal puffed as gas pressures equalized . Moving became more difficult . My companions in the lock began climbing . My turn came and I took hold of the ladder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumble and smear . With a kick , I cleared the lip , clambered out onto the rocky surface of the plain , and stood under the early morning sky . The sun topped a ridge of hills lying east , surrounded by a dull pink glow . I blinked at the glare . We 'd have to hike over those hills to get to UMS . It had taken us half an hour simply to climb to the surface . We stood a few meters east of the trench dome , waiting for Gretyl to join us . In just minutes , smear clung to us all ; we 'd have to destat for half an hour when all this was over . Gretyl emerged from the hole . Her voice decoded in my right ear , slightly muffled . " Let 's get together behind Sean 's group , " she said . We could breathe , we could talk to each other . All was working well so far . " We 're off , " Sean said , and his teams began to walk away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of Charles from behind as his group marched in broken formation toward the hills , a little south of the track we would follow . I wondered why I was paying any attention to him at all . Skinseal hid little . He had a cute butt . Ever so slightly stcatopygous . I bit my lip to bring my thoughts together . I 'm a red rabbit , I told myself . I 'm on the Up for the first time in two years , and there are no scout  | supervisors or trailmasters in charge , checking all our gear , making sure we get back to our mommies . Now focus , damn you ! " Let 's go , " Gretyl said , and we began our trek . It was a typical Martian morning , springtime balmy at minus twenty Celsius . The wind had slowed to almost nothing . The air was clear for two hundred kilometers . Thousands of stars pricked through at zenith like tiny jewels . The horizon glimmered shell-pink . All my thoughts aligned . Something magical about the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our situation . . . and of our chances of surviving . The surface of Mars was usually deadly cold . This close to the equator , however , the temps were relatively mild  --  seldom less than minus sixty . Normal storms could push winds up to four hundred kiphs , driving clouds of fine smear and flopsand high enough and wide enough to be seen from Earth . Rarely , a big surge of jetstream activity could send a high-pressure curl over several thousand kilometers , visible from orbit as a snaking dark line , and that could raise clouds that would quickly cover most of Mars . But the air on high Sinai Planum , at five millibars , was too thin to worry about most of the time . The usual winds were gentle puffs , barely felt . My booted feet pounded over the crusted sand and tumble . Martian soil gets a thin crust after a few months of lying undisturbed ; the grains fall into a kind of mechanical cement that feels a lot like hoarfrost . I could dimly hear the others crunching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozens of meters away . " Let 's not get too scattered , " Gretyl said . I passed an old glacier-rounded boulder bigger than the main trench dome . Ancient ice flows had sculpted the crustal basalt into a rounded gnome with its arms splayed across the ground , flat head resting on its arms in sleep . . . pretended sleep . Somehow , red rabbits never became superstitious about the Up . It was too orange and red and brown , too obviously dead , to appeal to our morbid instincts . " If they 're smart and somebody 's anticipating us , there may be pickets out this far to keep track of the periphery of the university , " Sean said over the radio . " Or if somebody 's tattled , " Gretyl added . I was starting to like Gretyl . Despite having an unpleasant voice and an unaltered , shrewlike face , Gretyl seemed to have a balanced perspective . I wondered why she had kept that face . Maybe it was a family face , something to be proud of p 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features , mandated by law . The long nose of King Henry of England . Damn . Focus gone . I decided it did n't matter . Maybe focusing on keeping a focus was a had thing . The sun hung above the ridge now , torch-white with the merest pink tinge . Around it whirled the thinnest of opal hazes , high silicate and ice clouds laced against the brightening orange of day . The rock shadows started to fill in , making each step a little easier . Sometimes wind hollows hid behind boulders , waiting for unwary feet . Gretyl 's group had spread out . I walked near the front , a few steps to her right . " Picket , " said Garlin Smith on my right , raising his arm . He had been my classmate in mass psych , quiet and tall , what ignorant Earth folks thought a Martian should look like . We all followed Garlin 's pointing finger to the east and saw a lone figure standing on a rise about two hundred meters away . It carried a rifle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't believe it . " The figure wore a full pressure suit  --  a professional job , the type worn by areologists , farm inspectors , Statist police . It reached up to tap its helmet . It had n't seen us yet , apparently , but it was picking up the jumbled buzz of our coded signals . " Keep going , " Gretyl said . " We have n't come this far to be scared off by a single picket . " " If it is a picket , " Sean commented , listening to our chat . " Do n't assume anything . " " It has to be a picket , " Gretyl said . " All right , " Sean said with measured restraint . The figure caught sight of us about four minutes after we first noticed it . We were separated by a hundred meters . It looked like a normal male physique from that distance . My breath quickened . I tried to slow it . " Report , " Sean demanded . " Armed male in full pressure suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gretyl said . We did n't deviate from our path . We would pass within fifty meters of the picket . The helmeted head turned , watching us . He held up a hand . " Hey ,  | what is this ? " a masculine voice asked . " What in hell are you doing up here ? Do you folks have ID ? " " We 're from UMS , " Gretyl said . We did n't slow our pace . " What are you doing up here ? " the picket repeated . " Surveying , what 's it look like ? " Gretyl responded . We carried no instruments . " What are you doing up here ? " " Do n't bunny with me , " he said . " You know there 's been trouble . Just tell me what department you 're from and . . . have you been using code ? " " No , " Gretyl said . We had closed another twenty yards . He started to hike down the rise to inspect us . " What in hell are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . " Shit , it 's skinseal . It 's against the law to wear that stuff except in emergencies . How many of you are there ? " " Forty-five , " Gretyl lied . " I 've been told to keep intruders off university property , " he said . " I 'll need to see IDs . You should have UMS passes to even be up here . " " Is that a gun ? " Gretyl asked , faking a lilt of surprise . " Hey , get over here , all of you . " " Why do you need a gun ? " " Unauthorized intruders . Stop now . " " We 're from the Areology Department , and we 've only got a few hours up here . . . Did n't you get a waiver from Professor Sunder ? " " No , dammit , stop right now . " " Listen , friend , who do you answer to ? " " UMS is secure property . You 'd better give me your student ID numbers now . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rifle , a long-barreled , slender automatic flechette . My anger and fear were almost indistinguishable . Dauble and Connor must have lost their minds . No student on Mars had ever been shot by police , not in fifty-three years of settlement . Had n't they ever heard of Tienanmen or Kent State ? " Use it , " Gretyl said . " You 'll be all over the Triple for shooting areology students on a field trip . Great for your career . Really spin you in with our families , too . What kind of work you looking for , rabbit ? " Our receivers jabbered with the picket 's own coded outgoing message . More jabber returned . p 27 The man lowered his rifle and followed us . " Are you armed ? " he asked . " Where would students get guns ? " Gretyl asked . " Who in hell is giving you orders to scare us ? " " Listen , this is serious . I need your IDs now . " " We 've got his code , " Sean said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can . " " Great , " Gretyl said . " Who are you talking to ? Stop using code , " the picket demanded . " Maybe they 're not clueing you , rabbit , " Gretyl taunted . Gretyl 's bravado , her talent for delay and confusion , astonished me . Perhaps she and Sean and a few of the others had been training for this . I wished I knew more about revolution . The word came to me like a small blow on my back . This was a kind of revolution . " Jesus , " I said with my transmitter off . " What 's he doing ? " Sean asked . " He 's following us , " Gretyl said . " He does n't seem to want to shoot . " " Not with flechettes , sure enough , " Sean said . " What a banner that would be ! " I filled in the details involuntarily : STUDENTS RIPPED BY BURROWING DARTS . More code whined in our ears like angry insects . We marched over another rise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poke-ups of UMS . The UMS warrens extended to the northeast for perhaps a kilometer , half levels above , ten levels deep . The administration chambers were closest to the surface entrance and the nearby train depot . Train guides hovered on slender poles , arcing gently over another rise to link with the station . Sean 's teams were probably there now . More guards emerged from the UMS buildings , armed and in full pressure suits . " All right , " came a gruff female voice . " State your business . Then get the hell out of here or you 'll be arrested . " Gretyl stepped forward , a scrawny little red devil with a black masked head . " We want an audience with Chancellor Connor . We are students who have been illegally voided and whose contracts have been flagrantly broken . We demand ? " " Who in hell do you think you are ? A bunch of fapping rodents ? " The woman 's voice scared me . She sounded outraged , on the edge of something drastic . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if she was outside at all . " You 've crossed regional property . Goddamned Gobacks should know what that means . "  | " I 'm not going to argue , " Gretyl said . " We demand to speak with ? " " You 're talking to her , you ignorant shithead ! I 'm right here . " The foremost figure raised an arm and shook a gloved fist . " And I 'm in no mood to negotiate with trespassers and Gobacks . " " We 're here to deliver a petition . " Gretyl removed a metal cylinder from her belt and extended it . One of the guards started forward , but Connor grabbed his elbow and shook it once , firmly . He backed away and folded his arms . " Politics of confrontation , " Connor said , voice harsh as old razors . " Agitprop and civil disobedience . You 'd think you were on Earth . Politics does n't work that way here . I have a mandate to protect this university and keep order . " " You refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm meeting with you now . Nobody demands anything of lawful authority except through legal channels . Who 's behind you ? " I looked over my shoulder , misunderstanding . " There 's no conspiracy , " Gretyl said . " Lies , my dear . Genuine lies . " " Under Martian contract law , we have the right to meet with you and discuss why we have been voided and our contracts broken . " " State law superseded BM law last month . " " Actually , it does n't . If you want to check with your lawyers ? " Gretyl began . I cringed . We were bickering and time was running out . " You have one minute to turn around and go back to where you came from , or we 'll arrest you , " Connor said . " Let the legals sort it out . Do your families know where you are ? How about your advocates ? Do they know and approve ? " Gretyl 's words bristled . " I ca n't believe you are being so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Right . Arrest them , my authority , statute two-five-one , Syria-Sinai district books . " Some of the students began to talk , asking worried questions . " Quiet ! " Gretyl shouted . She turned to Connor . " Is this your last answer ? " " You poor dumb rodents , " Connor said . She swiveled to enter the open lock door . Connor behaved even more rudely than she had been portrayed to us in the briefings , supremely confident , intractable and ready to provoke an incident . Guards moved forward . I turned and saw three guards behind us , also closing . We had to submit . Gretyl stepped away from the first guard . Another flanked her on the right , coming between us , and she stepped back . There were twenty of us and ten guards .  | " Let them take you , " Gretyl said . " Let them arrest you . " Then why was she resisting ? A guard took my arm and applied sticky rope to my skinsealed wrist . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grinning . " You would n't last another hour out here . " Two of the guards devoted themselves exclusively to Gretyl . They advanced with hands and sticky ropes held out . She backed away , held up her arm as if waving to them , and touched her mask . Time got stiff . Gretyl turned to look at the rest of us . Her eyes looked scared . My heart sank . Do n't do anything just to impress Sean , I wanted to shout to her . " Tell them what you saw here , " Gretyl said . " Freedom conquers ! " Her fingers plucked at and then slipped beneath the seam of the mask . A guard grabbed at her arm but he was n't quick enough . Gretyl ripped away the mask and sprang to one side , sending it flying with a wide toss . Her long-nosed face flashed pale and narrow against the pink sky . She squeezed her eyes shut and clamped her mouth instinctively . Her arms reached out , fingers extended , as if she were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard small thumps and felt the ground vibrate . Connor had n't had time to enter the poke-up airlock . " Get her inside ! Get her inside ! " she screeched , pushing through her associates . The guards stood still as statues for what seemed like minutes , then reached for Gretyl and dragged her as fast as they could to the airlock . She struggled in their arms . I saw her face pinking , blood vessels near the surface rupturing as the plasma boiled . Vacuum rose . Gretyl opened her eyes and reached up with one hand to grab at her chin . She pulled her own jaw open . The air in her lungs rushed out , moisture freezing in a cloud in the still air . " They 've blown track , " someone shouted . " Get her INSIDE ! " Gretyl looked at the sky through rime-clouded eyes . The guard in front of me jerked the sticky rope forward and I fell into the dirt . For an instant it seemed he might kick me . I looked up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , face slack . He stopped and blinked , waiting for orders . I twisted my head around to see how my companions were being treated . Several lay in the dirt . The guards systematically pushed us down and planted boots on our backs . When all nineteen lay flat , the guards  | stood back . The door to the lock opened again and someone stepped out , not Connor . " They 're under arrest , " a man 's voice said over the radio . " Get them inside . Strip that stuff off and put them in a dorm . Delouse them . " There have never been lice on Mars . They separated us quickly . Three guards pulled five of us away from the airlock and marched us through chilly tunnels to the old dorms , seldom used now . The new dorms had been equipped with more modern conveniences , but these were maintained for an emergency or future overload of students . " Can you get this off by yourself ? " the tallest of the three asked , gesturing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights of the hall , lips downturned , eyes miserable . " What did he mean , delouse ? " another guard asked , a young , muscular male with West Indian features and accent . The guards were all fresh Martians . That made sense . The new United Mars state would be their sponsor , their BM and family . " You ca n't just hold us here , " I said . " What happened to Gretyl ? " My four companions turned on the guards , pointing fingers and shouting . We all demanded our rights  --  communication , freedom , advocates . It became an open rebellion until the third guard pulled a flechette from his pack . He was the shortest , a slim man with plain , short-cut brown hair and perfect , saintly features . His eyes narrowed , very cold . I thought , Here 's a Statist sympathizer . The others were merely hired hands . " Blow it down , right now , " he demanded . " You injured Gretyl ! " I shouted . " We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treason . We could shoot you in self-defense . " He raised the pistol . All of us backed away , including the two other guards . " That would n't be smart , " I said . " Not for you . " The slim fellow gave us a cold thin smile and pushed us down the hall . We entered a stripped-down double room , immediately sprawling on the bare cot and chairs , another small gesture of useless defiance . " You 're going to be here for a while , so get comfortable . " I did n't like him pushing his pistol and did n't want to provoke him any further . We peeled off our skinseal  --  it was a blessed relief to be free of it , actually . The West Indian tossed the shreds into dust bags . Enough smear floated loose to make us sneeze .  | As if meeting for the first time , the five of us nodded and made introductions where necessary . We knew each other only slightly ; one had been a classmate of mine , Felicia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not know Oliver Peskin well , a step higher and an agro major , and I had only met Tom Catlin and Chao Ming Jung in the trench dome . The slim fellow averted his eyes . Bizarre , waving a gun at us but ashamed of our bare flesh . He thrust the gun at the vapor sacks in the washroom . " I do n't know if you have lice , but you smell pretty rank . " The vapor bags had n't been refilled or filtered in some time and we did n't smell much better after the showers . Water was inadequate to get rid of smear , and we carried itchy patches of red and orange all over . We 'd have welts by tomorrow . Three hours passed and we learned nothing . The guards stayed in their suits to avoid the dust . They had removed any identifiers and would not tell us their names . The sympathizer grew more and more grim as the hours crawled , and then ramped up to nervous , fidgeting with his gun . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , his slate chimed and he answered . After a couple of brief acknowledgments , he sent the female guard out of the room . I wondered what they would do next , why they did n't want the woman there . Surely they were n't that stupid . Conversation with my companions became thin and quiet . Fear had worn off  --  we no longer thought we were going to be shot  --  but the numbing sense of isolation that replaced it was no better . We settled into shivering silence . The rooms were kept at minimum heat and we still did n't have any clothes . The three men suffered worse than Felicia and I. " It 's cold in here , " I said to the sympathizer . He agreed but did noth-ing . " It 's cold enough to make us sick , " said Oliver . " All right , " said the sympathizer . " We should find them some clothes , " said the West Indian . " No , " said the sympathizer . " Why not ? " Chao asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You caused a hell of a lot of trouble . Why make it any easier on you ? " " They 're human , man , " the West Indian said . He was not very old ,  | twelve or thirteen , and he had to be a recent immigrant . His West Indies accent was still obvious . The sympathizer squinted and shook his head dubiously . We 've won , I thought . With fools like this , the Statists do n't have a chance . I could n't quite convince myself , however . We spent ten hours in that dorm room , cold and naked , skin itching furiously . I fell asleep and dreamed of trees too tall to fit into any dome , rooted unprotected in the red dirt of Mars : redwoods in red flopsand , lofting a hundred meters , tended by naked children . I had had the dream before and it left me for a moment with an intense feeling of well-being . Then I remembered I was a prisoner . The West Indian prodded my shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes from my nakedness and drew his lips tightly together . " I want you to know I am not all in this , " he said . " My heart , I mean . I am truly a Martian , and this is my first work here , you know ? " I looked around . The sympathizer was out of the room . " Get us some clothes , " I said . " You blew up the train lines and these people , they are very angry . I just tell you , do n't blame me when the shit sprays . People go up and down the halls  --  the tunnels . I look out , there is so much going on . They are afraid , I think . " What did they have to be afraid of ? Had the LitVids grabbed Gretyl 's injury or death and put our cause on the sly spin ? " Can you send a message to my parents ? " " The fellow Rick has gone , " the West Indian said , shaking his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " What happened to Gretyl ? " He shook his head again . " I hear nothing about her . What I saw , it made me sick . Everybody is so crazy . Why did she do it ? " " To make a point , " I said . " Not worth losing your life , " the West Indian said , frowning deeply . " This is small history , petty people . On Earth ? " My temper flared . " Look , we 've only been here a hundred Earth years , and our history is small stuff by Earth standards , but you 're a Martian now , remember ? This is corruption and dirty politics  --  and if you ask me , it 's directly connected with Earth , and the hell with all of you ! " You really sound committed , I thought . Abuse could do wonders . I awakened the others with my outburst . Felicia sat up . " He is n't armed , " she observed .

" Do not try something , " he said , standing his ground with arms out , shaking his head . The door opened and the sympathizer returned . He and the West Indian exchanged glances and the West Indian tilted and shook his head , saying , " Oh , man . " Behind the sympathizer came a fellow with short black hair . He wore a tight-fitting , expensive , and fashionable green long-suit . " We 're kept here against our will ? " Oliver complained immediately . " Under arrest , " the man in the fashionable green suit said jovially . " For more than a day , and we demand to be released , " Oliver finished , folding his arms .

We clustered in bathrobes near the serving gates , the twenty-eight who had gone out with Sean and Gretyl , criminals caught in the act of sabotage . Those left behind in the trench domes had been collected as well . Dauble and Connor were about to celebrate their victory on LitVid across the Triple .  | Medias and Pressians , my father called them : the hordes of LitVid reporters that seemed to rise out of the ground at the merest hint of a stink . On Mars reporters were a hearty breed ; they learned early to get around the tight lips of BM families . Ten of the quickest and hardiest ? several familiar to me  --  stood with arbeiter attendants near the Statist cluster , ear loops recording all they saw , images edited hot for transmission to the satcoms . Diane stood in a group across the hall . She waved to me surreptitiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or six meters from me in our pack and did not appear injured . He saw me and nodded . Some from his group had sustained bruises and even broken bones . Blue boneknits graced three . We said nothing , stood meek and pitiful . This was our time to be victims of the oppressive state . Dauble came forward flanked by two advisors . A louder curled on her shoulder like a thin snake . " Folks , this has gone much too far . Chancellor Connor has been courteous enough to supply the families of these stu-dents ? " " Banned students ! " Oliver Peskin shouted next to me . Others took up the cry , and another chorus followed on with , " Contract rights ! Obliga-tions ! " Dauble listened , face fixed in gentle disapproval . The cries died down . " To supply all of their families with information on their whereabouts , and their status as arrested saboteurs , " she finished . " Where 's Gretyl ? " I shouted , hardly aware I 'd opened my mouth . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Gretyl ? " " Family advocates are flying in now . The train service has been cut , thanks to these students , and our ability to uplink on broadband has been severely curtailed . These acts of sabotage ? " " Illegal voiding ! " another student shouted . " Constitute high felonies under the district book and United Martian codes ? " " Where 's SEAN ? Where 's GRETYL ? " Oliver shouted , hair awry , flinging up his hand , fingers splayed . Guards moved in , shoving through us none too gently , and grabbed him . Connor stepped forward and raised her arm . Achmed Crown Niger ordered the guards to release him . Oliver shrugged their arms away and smiled back at us triumphantly . Dauble seemed unaffected by the confusion . " These acts will be fully prosecuted . " " Where 's SEAN ? Where 's GRETYL ? " several students yelled again .  | " Sean 's dead ! Gretyl 's dead ! " shouted one high , shrill voice . The effect was electric . " Who says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried out and milled like sheep . " Nobody has been killed , " Dauble said , her composure suddenly less solid . " Bring SEAN ! " Dauble conferred with her advisors , then turned back to us . " Sean Dickinson is in the university infirmary with self-inflicted wounds . Everything possible is being done to help him . Gretyl Laughton is in the infirmary as well , with injuries from self-exposure . " The reporters had n't heard this yet ; their interest was immediate , and all focused on Dauble . " How were the students injured ? " asked one reporter , her pickup pointed at Dauble . " There have been several small injuries ? " " Inflicted by the guards ? " " No , " Connor said . " Is it true the guards have been armed all along ? Even before the sabotage ? " another reporter asked . " We anticipated trouble from the beginning , " Dauble said . " These students have proven us correct . " " But the guards are n't authorized police or regulars  --  how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justify all of it ! " Diane shouted . " I do n't understand your attitude , " Dauble said to us after a few moments of careful consideration in the full gaze of hot LitVid . " You sabotage life-support equipment ? " " That 's a lie ! " a student shouted . " Disrupt the lawful conduct of this university , and now you resort to attempted suicide . What kind of Martians are you ? Do your parents approve of this treachery ? " Dauble screwed her face into an expression between parental exasperation and deep concern . " What in the hell is wrong with you ? Who raised you  --  thugs ? " The meeting came to an abrupt end . Dauble and her entourage departed , followed by the reporters . When several reporters tried to talk to us , they were unceremoniously ejected from the dining hall . How very , very stupid , I thought . * * *  | I felt a bit faint from hunger ; we had n't eaten in twenty hours . A few university staff , clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nutritional nano was tasteless but still seemed heavensent . We had been provided with sleeping pads and blankets and were told winds were up and dust was blowing , grounding shuttles . No advocates or parents had yet come in to see us . While being fed , we had been divided into groups of six , each assigned two guards . The guards actively discouraged talk between the groups , moving us farther and farther apart until we spread out through the hall . Oliver , considered a loudmouth activist , was prodded into a selected group of other loudmouths that included Diane . Charles sat with five others across the hall , about twenty meters away . When we still tried to talk , the dining hall sound system blared out loud pioneer music , old-fashioned soul-stirring crap I had enjoyed as a kid , but found bitterly inappropriate now . When I was free to speak with the Medias and Pressians , I thought , what a story I 'd tell . . . I had seen and done things in the past few days that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had felt emotions unknown to me : righteous anger , political confraternity and solidarity , deep fear . I worried for Sean . All our information came through Achmed Crown Niger , who visited every few hours to hand out scraps of generally useless news . I took a real dislike to him : professional , collected , he was every gram the guvvie man . I focused on his pale , fine-featured face for a time , blaming him for all our troubles . He must have advised the chancellor and governor . . . He must have outlined their strategy , maybe even planned the banning and voiding of students .. . I thought dreamily about a possible life with Sean , if he paid any attention to me after his recovery . Nothing to do . Nothing to think . The lights in the dining hall went out . The music stopped . I slept on the floor , nestled like a puppy against Felicia 's back . Someone touched my shoulder . I opened my eyes from a light doze . Charles leaned over me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same : too calm , somehow , like a young Buddha . His cheeks had pinked as if smirched with poorly applied makeup : a mild case of vacuum rose . Most of the students around us still slept . " Are you okay ? " he asked . I sat up and looked around . The lights were still dim , but it was obvious the guards had gone . p 37 " Tired , " I said . I swallowed hard . My throat was parched and I could feel the oxidant welts itching fiercely . " Where 's our food and water ? " " I do n't think we 're going to get any unless we go for it ourselves . " I stood and stretched my arms . " Are you all right ? " I asked , squinting at him , reaching up to his cheeks . " My mask leaked . I 'm fine . My eyes are okay . You look strong , " Charles said . " I feel shitty , " I said . " Where are the guards ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can . " " Why ? " He lifted his hands . " I do n't know . They backed out about an hour ago . Oliver Peskin and Diane walked over and we squatted on the floor in whispered confab . Felicia stirred and poked Chao in the ribs . " What happened to Sean ? " Diane asked Charles . " He was planting a charge when it went off , " Charles said . " They say he set it off on purpose . " " He would n't do that , " Felicia said , face screwed up in disgust . " Gretyl pulled her mask off , " I said . " Insane , " Charles said . " She had her reasons , " Chao said . " Anyway , " Diane went on . " We need leaders . " " We 're not going to be here much longer , " Oliver said . " Oliver 's right . We 're not guarded . Something 's changed , " Charles said . " We have to stick together , " Diane insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have changed in our favor , " Oliver said . " It could n't get any worse . " " We still need leaders , " I said . " We should wake people up now and see what the group thinks . " " What if we 've won ? " Felicia asked . " What do we do ? " " Find out how much we 've won , and why , " Charles said . We explored the tunnels around the dining hall , venturing back to the old dorms , all quite empty now . We encountered a few arbeiters about their maintenance business , but no humans . After an hour , we began to worry  --  the situation was spooky . Fanning out , we began a systematic exploration of the upper levels of the entire university , reporting to each other on local links . Charles volunteered to join me . We took the north tunnels , closest to emergency external shafts and farthest from the administration chambers . The tun-  | nels were dark but warm ; the air smelled stale , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the deserted halls . The university seemed to be in an emergency power-down . Charles walked a step ahead . I watched him closely , wondering why he wanted to be so friendly when I had given him so little encouragement . We did n't say much , simply stating the obvious , signaling to each other with whistles after splitting to try separate tunnels , nodding cordially when we rejoined and moved on . Gradually we moved south again , expecting to meet up with other students . We explored a dark corridor connecting the old dorm branch with UMS 's newer tunnels . A bright light flashed ahead . We stood our ground . A woman in an ill-fitting pressure suit shined her light directly into our faces . " University staff ? " she asked . " Hell , no . Who are you ? " Charles asked . " I 'm an advocate , " the woman said . " Pardon the stolen suit . I flew in through the storm about half an hour ago . Landed during a dust lull and found a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no air in here . " " Who told you that ? " " The last man out , and he went in a hurry , too . Are you all right ? " " I 'm fine , " I said . " Where is everybody ? " The advocate lifted her face plate and sniffed noisily . " Sorry . My nose hates flopsand . The university was evacuated seven hours ago . Bomb threat . They said a bunch of Gobacks had dumped air and planted charges in the administration chambers . Everybody left in ground vehicles . They took them overland by tractor to an intact train line . " " You 're brave to come this far , " Charles said . " You do n't think there is a bomb , do you ? " The woman removed her helmet and smiled wolfishly . " Probably not . They did n't tell us anybody was here . They must not like you . How many are here ? " " Ninety . " " They voided the reporters before they evacuated . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . So where are the rest of you ? " We led her to the dining hall . All the far-flung explorers were called in . The advocate stood in the middle of the assembly , asking and answering questions . " I presume I 'm the first advocate to get here . First off , my name is Maria Sanchez Ochoa . I 'm an independent employed by Grigio BM from Tharsis. "  | Felicia stepped forward . " That 's my family , " she said . Two others came forward as well . " Good to see you , " Maria Sanchez Ochoa said . " The family 's worried . I 'd like to get your names and report that you 're all safe . " " What 's happened ? " Diane asked . " I 'm very confused . " Others joined in . " What happened to Sean and Gretyl ? " I asked , interrupting the bab-ble . " University security handed them over to Sinai district police early yesterday morning . Both were injured , but I do n't know to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own hands . " " They 're alive ? " I continued . " I presume so . They 're at Time 's River Canyon Hospital . " She started recording names , lifting her slate and letting each speak and be recognized in turn . I looked to my right and saw Charles standing beside me . He smiled , and I returned his smile and put a hand on his shoulder . " Will someone take this outside and shoot it up to a satcom ? None of the cables or repeaters are working , thanks to you folks . " Ochoa gave her slate to a student , who left the dining area to get to the glass roof of the administration upper levels . " Now , some background , since I doubt you 've heard much news re-cently . " " Nothing useful , " Oliver said . " Right . I hate to tell you this , but you did n't do a thing for your cause by acting like a bunch of Parisian Communards . The Statist government planted its own bombs months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they exploded just two days ago . We have a bad situation here , folks , and that explains some of the delay in getting to you . The constitutional accord is off . The Statists have resigned , and the old BM Charter government has been called back into session . " The battle was over . But we were small potatoes . Ochoa concluded by saying , " You folks have wrecked university property , you 've violated laws in every Martian book I can think of , and you 've put yourselves in a great deal of danger . What has it gotten you ? " Fortunately , it probably wo n't get you any time in jail . I 've heard that former Statist politicos are shipping out by dozens  --  and that probably includes Connor and Dauble . Nobody in their right mind is going to charge you under Statist law . " " What did they do ? " Charles asked . " Nobody 's sure about all that they 've done , but it looks like the gov-  | ernment invited Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let them mine Hellas ? " Gasps from the assembly . We had thought we were radical . " And planned to nationalize all BM holdings by year 's end . " We met these pronouncements with stunned silence . We stayed in the old dorms while security crews from Gorrie Mars BM checked out the entire university grounds . New rails were manufactured , trains came in , and most of us went home . I stayed , as did Oliver , Felicia , and Charles . I was beginning to think that Charles wanted to be near me . I met my family in the station two days after our release , Father and Mother and my older brother Stan . My parents looked pale and shaken by both fear and anger . My father told me , in no uncertain terms , that I had violated his most sacred principles in joining the radicals . I tried to explain my reasons , but did n't get through to him , and no wonder : they were n't entirely clear to me . Stan , perpetually amused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood back with a calm smile . That smile reminded me of Charles . Charles , Oliver , Felicia and I bought our tickets at the autobox and walked across the UMS depot platform . We all felt more than a little like outlaws , or at least pariahs . It was late morning and a few dozen interim university administrators had come in on the same train we would be taking out . Dressed in formal grays and browns , they stood under the glass skylights shuffling their feet , clutching their small bags and waiting for their security escort , glancing at us suspiciously . Rail staff did n't know we were part of the group responsible for breaking the UMS line , but they suspected . All credit to the railway that it honored charter and did not refuse service . The four of us sat in the rearmost car , fastening ourselves into the narrow seats . The rest of the train was empty . In 2171 , five hundred thousand kilometers of maglev train tracks spread over Mars , thousands more being added by arbeiters each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : sitting in comfort and silence as the silver millipedes flew centimeters above their thick black rails , rhythmically boosting every three or four hundred meters and reaching speeds of several hundred kiphs . I loved watching vast stretches of boulderstrewn flatlands rush by , seeing fans of dust topped by thin curling puffs as static blowers in the train 's nose cleared the tracks ahead . p 41 I did not much enjoy the train ride to Time 's River Canyon Hospital , however . We did n't have much to say . We had been elected by the scattered remnants of the protest group to visit Sean and Gretyl . We accelerated out of the UMS station just before noon , pressed into our seats , absorbing the soothing rumble of the carriage . Within a few minutes , we were up to three hundred kiphs , and the great plain below our ports became an ochre blur . In a window seat , I stared at the land and asked myself where I really was , and who . Charles had taken the seat beside me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture , I had felt empty or worse . The days of having nothing to do but sign releases and talk to temp security had worn me down to a negative . Oliver tried to break the gloom by suggesting we play a word game . Felicia shook her head . Charles glanced at me , read my lack of interest , and said , " Maybe later . " Oliver shrugged and held up his slate to speck the latest LitVid . I dozed off for a few minutes . Charles pressed my shoulder gently . We were slowing . " You keep waking me up , " I said . " You keep napping off in the boring parts , " he said . " You are so fapping pleasant , you know ? " I said . " Sorry . " His face fell . " And why are you . . . " I was about to say following me but I could hardly support that accusation with much evidence . The train had slowed and was now sliding into Time 's River Depot . Outside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Milky Way dropped between high canyon walls as if seeking to fill the ancient flood channel . " I think you 're interesting , " Charles said , unharnessing and stepping into the aisle . I shook my head and led the way to the forward lock , " We 're stressed , " I murmured . " It 's okay , " Charles said . Felicia looked at us with a bemused smile . In the hospital waiting room , an earnest young public defender thrust a slateful of release forms at us . " Which government are you sending these to ? " Oliver asked . The man 's uniform had conspicuous outlines of thread where patches had been removed . " Whoever , " he answered . " You 're from UMS , right ? Friends and colleagues of the patients ? " " Fellow students , " Felicia said .  | " Right . Now listen . I have to say this , in case one of you is going to shoot off to a LitVid . The Time 's River District neither condones nor condemns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martian charter and treat any and all patients , regardless of legal circumstance or political belief . Any statements they make do not repre-sent ? ' " " Jesus , " Felicia said . " ? the policy or attitudes of this hospital , nor the policy of Time 's River District . ' End of sermon . " The public defender stepped back and waved us through . I was shocked by what we saw when we entered Sean 's room . He had been tilted into a corner at forty-five degrees , wrapped in white surgical nano and tied to a steel recovery board . Monitors guided his reconstruction through fluid and optic fibers . Only now did we realize how badly he had been injured . As we entered his room , he turned his head and stared at us impassively through distant green-gray eyes . We made our awkward openings , and he responded with a casual , " How 's the outside world ? " " In an uproar , " Oliver said . Sean glanced at me as if I were only there in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost of mild interest . I specked the moments of passionate speech when he had riveted the crowded students and compared it to this lackluster shell and was immensely saddened . " Good , " Sean said , measuring the word with silent lips before repeating it aloud . He looked at a projected paleoscape on Mars on the wall opposite : soaring aqueduct bridges , long gleaming pipes suspended from tree-like pedestals and fruited with clusters of green globes , some thirty or forty meters across . . . A convincing mural of our world before the planet sucked in its water , shed its atmosphere , and withered . " The Council 's taken over everything again , " I said . " The syndics of all the BMs are meeting to patch things together . " Sean did not react . " Nobody 's told us how you were hurt , " Felicia said . We looked at her , astonished at this untruth . Ochoa had checked into all the security reports , including those filed by university guards , and pieced together the story . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , and I thought , Whatever Felicia is up to , he 'll tell the truth . . . and why expect him not to ?  | " The charges went off prematurely , before I had a chance to get out of the way . I set the charges alone . Of course . " " Of course , " Oliver said . Charles stayed in the rear , hands folded before him like a small boy at a funeral . " Blew me out of my skinseal . I kept my helmet on , oddly enough . Exposed my guts . Everything boiled . I remember quite a lot , strangely . Watching my blood boil . Somebody had the presence of mind to throw a patch over me . It wrapped me up and slowed me down and they pulled me into the infirmary about an hour later . I do n't remember much after that . " " Jesus , " Felicia said , in exactly the same tone she had used for the public defender in the waiting room . " We did it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sean said . " Actually ? " Oliver began , but Felicia , with a tender expression , broke in . " We did it , " she said . Oliver raised his eyebrows . " I 'm going to be okay . About half of me will need replacing . I do n't know who 's paying for it . My family , I suppose . I 've been thinking . " " Yeah ? " Felicia said . " I know what set the charge off , " Sean said . " Somebody broke the timer before I planted it . I 'd like one or all of you to find out who . " Nobody spoke for a moment . " You think somebody did it deliber-ately ? " I asked . Sean nodded . " We checked the equipment a hundred times and everything worked . " " Who would have done something like that ? " Oliver asked , horrified . " Somebody , " Sean said . " Keep the students together . This is n't over yet . " He turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Gretyl . Tell her she was a goddamned fool and I love her madly . " He bit into the words goddamned fool as if they were a savory cake that gave him great satisfaction . I had never seen such a join of pain and bitter pride . I nodded . " Tell her she and I will take the reins again and guide this mess home right . Tell her just that . " " Guide the mess home right , " I repeated , still under his spell . " We have a larger purpose , " Sean said . " We have to break this planet out of its goddamned business-as-usual , corrupt , bow-down-to-the-Triple , struggle-along mentality . We can do that . We can make our own party . It 's a beginning . " His eyes fixed on each of us in turn , as if to brand us.  | Felicia held out her splayed fingers and Sean lifted his free arm to awkwardly press his hand against hers . Oliver did the same . Charles stood back ; too much for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sean 's . But Sean saw my hesitation , my change of expression when Charles stepped back , and he dropped his hand before I could decide . " Heart and mind , heart and mind , " Sean said softly . " You are .. . Casseia , right ? Casseia Majumdar ? " " Yes . " " How did your family fare in all this ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " They 're fixed to prosper . The Gobacks will do well in the next government . It was funny , Connor thinking we were Gobacks . Are you a Goback , Casseia ? " I shook my head , throat tight . His tone was so stiff and distant , so reproving . " Show it to me , Casseia . Heart and mind . " " I do n't think you have any right to question my loyalty because of my family , " I said . Sean 's gaze went cold . " If you 're not dedicated , you could turn on us ... just like whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Charles said . " Nobody else touched it . Certainly not Casseia . " " We all slept , did n't we ? " Sean said . " But it 's irrelevant , really . That part 's over . " He closed his eyes and licked his lips . A cup came up from the wallmount arbeiter and a stream of liquid poured into his mouth . He sucked it up with the expertise of days in the hospital . " What do you mean ? " Felicia asked in a little voice . " I 'll have to pick all over again . Most of you went home , did n't you ? " " Some did , " Felicia said . " We stayed . " " We needed students to occupy and hold , to take the administration chambers and dictate terms . We could work from the university as a base , claim it as a forfeit for illegal voiding , claim it for damages . If I had been there , that 's what we would have done . " I felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed with my very real infatuation and guilt at not serving the cause better , turned my stomach . " Go talk to Gretyl . And you two . . . " He pointed to Charles and me . " Think it over . Who are you ? Where do you want to be in ten years ? " * * * p 45 Gretyl was less severely injured , but looked worse . Her head had been wrapped in a bulky breather , leaving only a gap for her eyes . She had been laid back at forty-five degrees on a steel recovery plate as well , and tubes ran from mazes of nano clumps on her chest and neck . An arbeiter had discreetly draped the rest of her with a white sheet for our visit . She watched us enter , and her silky artificial voice said , " How 's Sean ? You 've been to see him ? " " He 's fine , " Oliver said . I was too unhappy to talk . " We have n't been allowed to visit . This hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get any attention ? " Felicia explained as gently as possible that we really had n't accomplished much . She was ready to be a little harder with Gretyl than with Sean ; perhaps she was infatuated with Sean as well . I had a sudden insight into people and revolutions , and did not like what I saw . " Sean has a plan to change that , " Gretyl said . " I 'm sure he does , " Oliver said . " What 's on at UMS ? " " They 're moving in a new administration . All the Statist appointees have resigned or been put on leave . " " Sounds like they 're being punished . " " It 's routine . All appointments are being reviewed , " Oliver said . Gretyl sighed  --  an artificial note of great beauty  --  and extended her hand . Felicia squeezed it . Charles and I remained in the background . " He thinks the charge that blew up was tampered with , " Oliver said . " It may have been , " Gretyl said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only you and he handled it , " Charles said . Gretyl sighed again . " It was just a standard Excavex two-kilo tube . We did n't pay a lot of money . The people who stole it for us may have tampered with it . They could have done something to make it go off . That 's possible . " " We do n't know that , " Oliver said . " Listen , friends , if we have n't attracted any attention yet , it 's be-cause ? " She stopped and her eyes tracked the room zipzip , then nar-rowed . " I have new eyes , " she said . " Do you like the color ? You 'd better go now . We 'll talk later , after I 'm released . " On our way out of the hospital , in the tunnel connecting us to Time 's River Station 's main tube , a hungry-looking , poorly-dressed and very young male LitVid agent tried to interview us . He followed us for thirty meters , glancing at his slate between what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glum and too smart to give any answers , but despite our reticence , we ended up in a ten-second flash on a side channel for Mars Tharsis local . Sean , on the other hand , was interviewed the next day for an hour by an agent for New Mars Committee Scan , and that was picked up and broadcast by General Solar to the Triple . He told our story to the planets , and by and large , what he told was not what I remembered . Nobody else was interviewed . My sadness grew ; my fresh young idealism waned rapidly , replaced by no wisdom to speak of , nothing emotionally concrete . I thought about Sean 's words to us , his accusations , his pointed suspicion of me , his interview spreading distortions around the Triple . Now , I would say that he lied , but it 's possible Sean Dickinson even then was too good a rabbler to respect the truth . And Gretyl , I think , was about to pass on some sound advice about political need dictating how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our dorms at UMS , we found notices posted and doors locked . Diane met me and explained that UMS had been closed for the foreseeable future due to " curriculum revisions . " Flashing icons beneath the ID plates told us we could enter our quarters once and remove our belongings . Train fare to our homes or any other destination would not be provided . Our slates received bulletins on when and where the public hearings would be held to determine the university 's future course . We were arguably worse off than we had been with Dauble and Con-nor . Charles helped Diane and me pull our belongings from the room and stack them in the tunnel . There were n't many  --  I had sent most of my effects home after being voided . I helped Charles remove his goods , about ten kilos of equipment and research materials . We ate a quick lunch in the train station . We did n't have much to say . Diane , Oliver and Felicia departed on the northbound , and Charles saw me to the eastbound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held out his hand , and we shook firmly . " Will I see you again ? " he asked . " Why not ? " I said . " When our lives are straightened out . " He held onto my hand a little longer and I gently removed it . " I 'd like to see you before that , " he said . " For me , at least , that might be a long way off . "  | " All right , " I said , squeezing through the door . I did n't commit myself to when . I was in no mood to establish a relationship . My father forgave me . Mother secretly admired all that I had done , I think  --  and they personally footed the bill for expensive autoclasses , to keep me up-to-date on my studies . They could have charged it to the BM education expenses , as part of the larger Goback revival . Father was a firm believer in BM rule , but too honorable to squeeze BM-appropriated guvvie funds , or take the victor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on General Solar LitVid . She was on the long dive to Earth , issuing pronouncements from the WHTCIPS ( Western Hemisphere Transport Coalition Interplanetary Ship ) Barrier Reef , returning , she was at pains to make Martians understand , to a kind of hero 's welcome . Dauble was with her but said nothing , since day by day the awful truth of her failed Statist administration was coming out . It so happened that there was a Majumdar BM advocate on that very ship , and he took it upon himself to represent all the BMs and other interests hoping to settle with Connor and Dauble . He served them papers , day after day after day , throughout the voyage . . . By the time both of them got to Earth , ten months later , they would be poor as Jackson 's Lode , born on Mars , exiled to Earth , doomed to dodging Triple suits for the rest of their days . 2172 , M.Y . 53 WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON MARS WAS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF POLITICS IN action in a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to Earth history , and I should have been fascinated , but in fact I ignored much of the daily news . My youthful ideals had been trodden on none too delicately , and I did n't know what to make of it . Before I could speck out the eventual course of my education and decide how to serve my family , I had to reestablish who I was . My mother supported my youthful indecision ; my father gave in to my mother . I had some time away from commitments . When UM restarted classes , I switched campuses and majors , going to Durrey Station , the third-largest town on Mars and home of UM 's sec-ond-largest branch . I studied high humanities  --  text lit from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , philosophy before quantum mechanics , and the most practical subject in my list , morals and ethics as a business  | art . Four hapless souls shared my major , studying things most pioneering , practical Martians could not have given a damn about . I needed a rest . So I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months . I did not know he had gone to Durrey Station as well . When classes started , we did not run into each other immediately . I saw him in Shinktown over student break . Seven hundred and ninety students fled UM Durrey at Solstice and either went to work on their farms , if from the local , more sober and well-established families of Mariner Valley , or took refuge in Shinktown . Some , already married , spread out to their half-built warrens , soon to become new stations , and did what married people do . My family kept no farms and required little of me in the way of overt filial piety . They loved me but let me choose my own paths . Shinktown was a not very charming maze of shops , small and discreet hotels , game rooms , and gyms , seventeen kilometers from Durrey Station , where students went to get away from their studies , their obligations to family and town ; to blow it all out and kick red . Mars has never been a planet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier culture . The goals of sex are procreation and the establishment of strong connections between individuals and families ; sex leads to ( or should lead to ) love and lasting relationships ; sex without love may not be sinful , but it is almost certainly wasteful . To the ideal Martian man or woman , as portrayed in popular LitVids , sex was never a matter of just scratching an itch ; it was devilishly complicated , fraught with significance and drama for individual and family , a potential liaison ( one seldom married within one 's BM ) and the beginning of a new entity , the stronger and dedicated dyad of perfectly matched partners . That was the myth and I admit I found it attractive . I still do . It 's been said that a romantic is someone who never accepts the evidence of her eyes and ears . In this age , few were physically unattractive . There was no need and little inclination among most Martians to let nature take its uncertain course . That particular question had been hammered into a viable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and more ago . I was attractive enough , my genetic heritage requiring little adjustment if any  --  I 'd never asked my mother and father , really  --  and men were not reluctant to talk to me . But I had never taken a lover , mostly because I found young men either far too earnest or far too frivolous or , most commonly , far too dull . What I wanted for my first ( and perhaps only ) love was not physical  | splendor alone , but something deeply significant , something that would make Mars itself  --  if not the entire Triple  --  sigh with envy when my imagined lover and I published our memoirs , in ripe old age .. . I was no more a prude than any other Martian . I did not enjoy going to bed alone . I often wished I could lower my standards just enough to learn more about men ; handsome men , of course , men with a little grit , supremely self-confident . For that sort of experimentation , beauty and physical splendor would be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  wit and beauty and prowess So fevered my dreams . Shinktown was a place of temptations for a young Martian , and that was why so many of us went there . I enjoyed myself at the dances , flirted and kissed often enough , but shied from the more intimate meetings I knew I could have . The one continuing truth of male and female rela-tions  --  that the man attempts and the woman chooses  --  was in my favor . I could attract , test , play the doubtless cruel and ( I thought ) entirely fair game of sampling the herd . In the middle of the break , on an early spring evening , a local university club held a small mixer following a jai alai game in the arena . I 'd attended the , game and was enjoying a buzz of frustration at lithe male bodies leaping and slamming the heavy little ball , uneasy with a mix of strong Shinktown double-ferment tea and a little wine , and I hoped to dance it off and flirt and then go home and think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while dancing with a Durrey third-form . Charles was talking to ( " chatting up " I said to myself ) a tall , big-eyed exotique who seemed to me way out of his league . When the dance ended , I edged through the crowd and bumped into him by accident from behind . He turned from the exotique , saw me , ana to my dismay , his face lit up like a child 's . He fell all over himself to disentangle from the big-eyed other . I had thought about the UMS action for months and wanted to talk about it , and Charles seemed perfect to fulfill that function . " We could get dinner , " Charles suggested as we strolled off the dance floor . " I 've already eaten , " I said . " Then a snack . " " I wanted to talk about last summer . " " Perfect opportunity , over a late dessert . " I frowned as if the suggestion were somehow improper , then gave in. ( ' harles took my arm  --  that seemed safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an outer tunnel arc . The arc branched north of  | Shinktown quarters for permanent residents and offered little convenience shops , most tended by arbeiters . We passed through the central quadrangle , a hectare of tailored green surrounded by six stories of stacked balconies . The quadrangle architecture tried to imitate the worst of old Earth , retrograde , oppressive . The shop arc , however , was comparatively stylish and benign . We sat in the cafe and sipped Valley coffee while waiting for our cakes to arrive . Charles said little at first , his nerves evident . He smiled broadly at my own few words , eager to be accommodating . Tiring rapidly of this verbjam , I leaned forward . " Why did you come to Shinktown ? " I asked . " Bored and lonely . I 've been up to my neck in Bell Continuum topoi . You . . . do n't know what that is , I presume . " " No , " I said . " Well , it 's fascinating . It could be important someday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you come ? " I shrugged . " I do n't know . For company , I suppose . " I realized , with some concern , that this was my way of being coquettish . My mother would have called it bitchy , and she knew me well enough . " Looking for a good dance partner ? I 'm probably not your best choice . " I waved that off . " Do you remember what Sean Dickinson said ? " He grimaced . " I 'd like to forget . " " What was wrong with him ? " " I 'm not much of a student of human nature . " Charles examined his tiny cup . The cakes arrived and Charles slapped palm on the arbeiter . " My treat , " he said . " I 'm old-fashioned . " I let that pass as well . " I think he was monstrous , " I said . " I 'm not sure I 'd go that far . " My lips wrapped around the word again , savoring it . " Monstrous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't he ? Remember , he was hurt . " " I 've tried to understand the whole situation , why we did n't accomplish anything . Why I was willing to follow Sean and Gretyl almost anywhere . . . " " Follow them ? Or the cause ? " " I believed  --  believe in the cause , but I was following them , " I said . " I 'm trying to understand why . " " They seemed to know what they were doing . " We talked for an hour , going in circles , getting no closer to understanding what had happened to us . Charles seemed to accept it as a  | youthful escapade , but I 'd never allowed myself the luxury of such japes . Failure gave me a deep sensation of guilt , of time wasted and opportunities missed . When we finished our cakes , it seemed natural that we should go someplace quiet and continue talking . Charles suggested the quad . I shook my head and explained that I thought it looked like an insula . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " An insula . An apartment building in ancient Rome . " " The city ? " Charles asked . " Yeah , " I said . " The city . " His next suggestion , preceded by a moment of perplexed reflection , was that we should go to his room . " I could order tea or wine . " " I 've had enough of both , " I said . " Can we get some mineral water ? " " Probably , " Charles said . " Durrey sits on a pretty fine aquifer . This whole area lies on pre-Tharsis karst . " We took a small cab to the opposite arc , hotels and temp quarters for Shinktown 's real source of income , the students . I do n't remember anticipating much of anything as we entered Charles 's room . There was nothing distinguished about the decor  --  inexpensive , clean , maintained by arbeiters , with no nano fixtures ; pleasant shades of beige , soft green , and gray . The bed could hold only one person comfortably . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me suddenly that by going this far , Charles might expect something more . We had n't even kissed yet , however , and the agreement had been that we come here to talk . Still , I wondered how I would react if Charles made a move . " I 'll order the water , " he said . He took two steps beside the desk , unsure whether to seat himself on the swing-out chair or the edge of the bed beside me . " Gassed or plain ? " " Plain , " I said . He set his slate on the desk port and placed an order . " They 're slow . Should take about five minutes . Old arbeiters , " he said . " Creaky , " I said . He smiled , sat on the chair , and looked around . " Not much luxury , " he said . " Ca n't afford more . " The one chair , a small net and corn desk , single drop-down bed with its thin blanket , vapor bag behind a narrow door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all squeezed into three meters by four . I casually wondered how many people had had sex in this room , and under what circumstances .  | " We could spend years trying to figure out Sean and Gretyl , " Charles said . " I do n't want you to think I 've forgotten what happened . " " Oh , no , " I said . " But I 've got too much else to ponder , really . " He used the word in a kind of self-parody , to deflate the burden it might carry . " I ca n't worry about the mistakes we made . " " Did we make mistakes ? " I asked . I smoothed some wrinkles in the thin blanket . " I think so . " " What mistakes ? " I led him on , angry again but hiding it . Charles finally pulled out the chair and sat with his elbows on his knees , hands clasped in front of him . " We should choose our leaders more carefully , " he said . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You said he was monstrous , ' " Charles reminded me . " Things went wrong for all of us , " I said . " If they had gone better , everything might have turned out differently . " " You mean , if Connor and Dauble had n't hung themselves , we might have provided the noose . " " It seems likely . " " I suppose that 's what Sean and Gretyl were trying to do , " Charles said . " All of us , " I added . " Right . But what would we have done after that ? What did Sean really want to accomplish ? " " In the long run ? " I asked . " Right , " Charles said . He was revealing a capacity I had n't seen before . I was curious to see how far this new depth extended . " I think they wanted anarchy . " I frowned abruptly . He looked at me and his face stiffened . " But I did n't really ? " " Why would they want anarchy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can never be a consensus leader . " " Why not ? " " He has the appeal of a LitVid image , " Charles said . How could he not see how much he was irritating me ? I felt a perversity again ; I wanted him to anger me , so I could deny him what he had come here to gain , that is , my favors . " Shallow ? " " I 'm sorry , this is upsetting you , " Charles said softly , kneading his  | hands . " I know you liked Sean . It makes me . . . I did n't want to bring you here to ? " The door chimed . Charles opened it and an arbeiter entered , carrying a bottle of Durrey Region Prime Drinking Water , Mineral . Charles handed me a glass and sat again . " I really do n't want to talk politics , " he said . " I 'm not very good at it . " " We came here to talk about what went wrong , " I persisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You disagree with me . " " Maybe , " I said . " But I want to hear what you have to say . " Charles 's misery became obvious in the set of his jaw , drawn in defensively toward his neck , and the way he clenched his hands . " All right , " he said . I could sense him giving up , assuming I was out of his reach , and that added to my irritation . Such presumption ! " What kind of leader would Sean be ? " " A tyrant , " Charles said softly . " Not a very good one . I do n't think he has what it takes . Not enough charm at the right time , and he ca n't keep his feelings under control . " My anger evaporated . It was the strangest feeling ; I agreed with Charles . That was the monstrousness I was trying to understand . " You 're a better judge of human nature than you think , " I said with a sigh . I leaned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've fapped up , " he said . " How ? " " I want to know you better . I feel something really special when I see you . Intrigued , I was about to continue with my infernal questioning ? ow ? What do you mean ? ? when Charles stood up . " But it 's useless . You have n't liked me from the start . " I gaped at him . " You think I 'm awkward , I 'm not in the least like Sean , and that was ho you 'd set your sights on . . . And now I seem to be putting him down . " " Sean does n't appeal to me , " I said , eyes downcast in what I hoped as demure honesty . " Certainly not after what he said . " " I 'm sorry , " Charles said . " Why are you always apologizing ? Sit down , please . " Neither of us had touched our mineral water . Charles sat . He lifted his glass . " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked in limestone . . . Old life . That 's what I 'd ally like to be doing . Besides getting the physics grants and starting  | research , I mean . Going Up and exploring the old sea beds . Not talking politics . I need someone to come with me and keep me company . I thought maybe you 'd like to do that . " Charles looked up , then rushed his proposal out breathlessly . " Klein BM has an old vineyard about twenty kilometers from here . I could borrow a tractor , show you the ? " " A winery ? " I asked , startled . " Failed . Converted to a water station . Not much more than a trench dome , but there are good fossil beds . Maybe the old discarded vintage has mellowed by now and we could try to gag it down . " " Are you asking ? " I felt a sudden warmth so immediate and unexpected that it brought moisture to my eyes . " Charles , you surprise me . " I surprised myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you expecting ? " " You might like me better away from this place . I do n't fit into Shinktown , and I do n't know why I came here . I 'm glad I did , of course , because you 're here , but . .. " " An old winery . And . . . going Up again ? " " In proper pressure suits . I 've done it often enough . I 'm pretty safe to be with . " He pointed his finger Up . " I 'm no LitVid idol , Casseia . I ca n't sweep you off your feet . " I pretended not to hear that . " I 've never gone fossiling , " I said . " It 's a lovely idea . " Charles swallowed and quickly decided to press on . " We could leave now . Spend a few days . Would n't cost much  --  my BM is n't rich , but we 'd borrow equipment nobody 's using now . No problem with the oxygen budget . We can bring hydrogen back for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station to warm up for us . " This was something slightly wicked and hugely unexpected and quite lovely . Charles would never pressure me to go one step farther than I wanted . It was perfect . " I 'll try not to bore you with physics , " he said . " I can take it , " I said . " What makes you think I was ever interested in Sean , romantically ? " Wisely , he did n't answer , and immediately set about making late-night preparations . Martians saw the surface of their world most often through the windows of a train . Perhaps nine or ten times in a life , a Martian would go Up and walk the surface in a pressure suit  --  usually in crowds and under close supervision , tourists on their own planet . Call it fear , call it reason , most Martians preferred tunnels , and  | dubbed themselves rabbits , quite comfortably ; red rabbits , to distinguish from the gray rabbits on Earth 's moon . I think I was more nervous sitting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months earlier . I trusted Charles not to lose us in the ravines and ancient glacier tongues ; he radiated self-confidence . What unnerved me was the proximity to emotions I had safely kept locked away behind philosophy . I will not explain my turnaround . I was becoming attracted to Charles , but the process was slow . As he drove , I sneaked looks at him and studied his lean features , his long , straight nose , slow-blinking eyes large and brown and observant , upper lip delicately sensuous , lower lip a trifle weak , chin prominent , neck corded and scrawny  --  a heady mix of features I found attractive and features I was n't sure I approved of . Unaesthetic , not perfection . Long fingers with square nails , broad bony shoulders , chest slightly sunken .. . I knit my brows and turned my attention to the landscape . I was not inclined to physical science , but no Martian can escape the past ; we are told tales in our infant beds . Mars was dead ; once , it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flopsands and viscous smear lay a thick layer of calcareous rock , limestone , the death litter of uncounted tiny living things on the floor of an ancient sea that had once covered this entire region and , indeed , sixty percent of northern Mars . The seas , half a billion Martian years before , had fallen victim to Mars 's aging and cooling . The interior flows of Mars slowed and stabi Iized just as Mars began to develop  --  and push aside  --  its continents , thus cutting short the migration of its four young crustal plates , ending the lives of chains of gas-belching volcanoes . The atmosphere began its long flight into space . Within six hundred million Martian years , life itself retreated , evolving to more hardy forms , leaving behind fossil sea beds and karsts and , last of all , the Mother Ecos and the magnificent aqueduct bridges . ( " Ecos " is singular ; " ecoi " plural . ) All around us , ridges of yellow-white limestone poked from the redochre flopsand . Rusted , broken boulders scattered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauce over vanilla ice cream . Against the pink sky , the effect was severe and heart-achingly beautiful , a chastening reminder that even planets are mortal . " Like it ? " Charles asked . We had n't talked much since leaving Durrey in the borrowed Klein tractor . " It 's magnificent , " I said . " Wait till we get to the open karsts  --  like prairie dog holes . Sure signs  | of aquifers , but it takes an expert to know how deep , and whether they 're whited . " Whited aquifers carried high concentrations of arsenic , which made the water a little more expensive to mine . " Whited seas had entirely different life forms . That 's probably where the mothers came from . " I knew little about the mother cysts  --  single-organism repositories of the post-Tharsis Omega Ecos , a world 's life in a patient nutshell , parents of the aqueduct bridges . Their fossils had been discovered only in the past few years , and I had n't paid much attention to news about them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Only in pictures . " " They 're magnificent . Bigger than a tractor , heavy shells a foot thick ? buried in the sands , waiting for one of the ancient wet cycles to come around again . . . The last of their kind . " His eyes shone and his mouth curved up in an awed half-smile . His enthusiasm distanced me for a moment . " Some might have lasted tens of millions of years . But eventually the wets never came . " He shook his head and his lips turned down sadly , as if he were talking about family tragedy . " Some hunters think we 'll find a live one someday . The holy grail of fossil hunters . " " Is that possible ? " " I do n't think so . " " Are there any fossil mothers where we 're going ? " He shook his head . " They 're very rare . And they 're not found in karsts . Most have been found in the sulci . " " Oh . " " But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's smile , open and trusting . The Klein BM winery , a noble experiment that had n't panned out , lay buried in the lee of a desiccated frost-heave plateau twenty kilometers west of Durrey Station . Now it was maintained by arbeiters , and fitfully at that , judging from the buildup of static flopsands on the exposed entrance . A gate carried a bright green sign , " Tres Haut Medoc . " Charles urged the tractor beneath the sign . The garage opened slowly and balkily , gears jammed with dust , and Charles parked the tractor in its dark enclo-sure . We sealed our suits and climbed down from the cabin . Charles palmed the lock port and turned to face me . " I have n't been here since the codes were changed . Hope I 've been logged on the old general Klein net . " " You did n't check ? " I asked , alarmed . " Joking , " he said . The lock opened , and we stepped in. p 57 * * * Over the years , the arbeiters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dutiful little hunchbacks , moving obsequiously out of our way as we explored the narrow tunnels leading to the main living quarters . " I 've never seen arbeiters this old , " I said . " Waste not , want not . Klein 's a thrifty family . They took the best machines with them and left a skeleton crew , just enough to tend the wa-ter . " " Poor things , " I said dubiously . " Voila , " Charles announced , opening the door to the main quarters . Beyond lay a madman 's idea of order , air mattresses piled into a kind of shelter in one corner , sheets covering a table as if it were a bed , decayed equipment lovingly stacked in the middle of the floor for human attention , smelling of iodine . The machines had been bored . A large arbeiter , about a meter tall and half as wide , a big barrel of a machine with prominent arms , stood proudly in the middle of its domain . " Welcome , " it greeted in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this estate for four years . How may we serve you ? " Charles laughed . " Do n't , " I said . " You 'll hurt its feelings . " The arbeiter hummed constantly , a sign of imminent collapse . " This unit will require replacements , if any are available , " it told us after a moment of introspective quiet . " You 'll have to make do , " Charles said . " What we need is a place fit for habitation , by two humans . . . separate quarters , as soon as possi-ble . " " This is not adequate ? " the arbeiter asked with mechanical dismay . " Close , but it needs a little rearrangement . " We could n't help giggling . The arbeiter considered us with that peculiar way older machines have of seeming balky and sentient when in fact they are merely slow . " Arrangements will be made . I beg your pardon , but this unit will require replacement parts and nano recharge , if that is possible . " Four hours later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several days stored and logged in with the arbeiters , ( ' harles and I stopped our rushing about and faced each other . Charles glanced away first , pretending to critically examine the interior furnishings . " Looks like a bunkhouse , " he said . " It 's fine , " I said . " Well , it 's not luxury . "  | " I did n't expect it to be . " " I came here once when I was ten , with my dad , " Charles said , rubbing his hands nervously on his pants . " A kind of getaway for a couple of days while traveling from Amnesia to Jefferson , through Durrey . . . Klein holdings intrude into the old Erskine BM lands here . I do n't know how that happened . " Another moment of uneasy silence . Clearly , Charles did not know how to begin , nor what was expected ; neither did I , but as the female in this pairing , it was not my responsibility to initiate , and I did not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he inquired suddenly , holding out his hand . I took the hand and we began our formal tour of Tres Haut Medoc . Charles was disarmingly nervous . Disarming , because I had to say little and do nothing but follow him ; he gave a gentle , constant commentary on things Martian , most of which I knew . His voice was soothing even as he ran through technical details . In time , I listened more to the tone than the content , enjoying the masculine music of fact laid upon fact , an architecture to shield us for the moment against being alone together . Ninety percent or more of any Martian station lay underground . Pressurization requirements and protection against radiation flux through the thin atmosphere made this the most economical method of construction . Some attempts had been made in the first ten years ' to push high-rises and multi-story uplooks through the dirt , but Mars had been settled on a shoestring . Buried or bermed construction was much cheaper . Heat exchangers , sensors , pokeups , entrances and exits , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we remained , by and large , troglodytes . Half of the aquifers on Mars were solid  --  mineral aquifers  --  and half liquid . Solid aquifers came in many varieties . Some were permafrosts and heaves , which produced hummocky terrain . Some ice domes on Mars were ten kilometers across , but nearly all heaves had long since lost the water that produced them . The evaporated water either re-condensed at the poles , or was lost across the ages to space . The thin atmosphere was nearly moisture-free . Tres Haut Medoc sat half a kilometer above a liquid flow , probably the same flow that supplied Durrey . Water seeped through the limestone and pooled in deeper fissures and caves extending as much as ten kilometers below the karst . Our first stop was the pumping station . The pump , a massive cluster of steel-blue cylinders and spheres melded together like an abstract sculpture , had been working steadily for fifteen Martian years . It extracted its own fuel , deuterium , from the water it pulled out of the ground . " We hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | Earth years , " Charles explained , walking around the pump . " Just after the winery shut down and the station was automated and evacuated . A source of revenue to offset our failure . " Our footsteps echoed hollow on the frosted stone floor . Air whispered through wall-mounted vents , cool and tangy-musty . " It 's the station 's only reason to exist now . Durrey wants it , pays for it , so we keep the pump going . While I 'm here , I 'll justify our visit by filing a report ... " " And get some replacement arbeiters , " I suggested . " Maybe . The folks who set up the winery were a California family ... Or were they Australian ? I forget now . " " Big difference , " I suggested . " Not really . I know a lot of Australians and Californians now . Except for accent , they 're pretty alike . My own family is from New Zealand , actually . How about yours ? " " I 'm not sure . German/Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , " Charles said . " I do n't pay much attention to heritage . " Charles led me into the water-settling chambers . The dark pools sat still as glass in their quarried limestone basins , filling two chambers each a hectare in extent and ten meters deep . Somewhere beneath our feet , transfer pumps thumped faintly , sending the water to Durrey 's buried pipelines . I breathed in the cold moist air , touched the damp limestone walls . " Like old bones , that rock , " Charles said . " Right . Sea bottoms . " " Half- our towns and stations could n't exist without limestone flats . " " Why did n't it get turned into marble or something ? " I asked , partly to demonstrate I was not totally ignorant of areology . Charles shook his head . " No major areological activity for the past billion years . Marble takes heat and pressure to form . Mars is asleep . It ca n't do the job any more . " " Oh . " I had not demonstrated anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; I was giving Charles every chance to show off , just to see who he really was , what kind of man I had chosen to spend a few days with , alone . We took a bridge over the farthest pool and down a sloping tunnel . The next chamber held row upon row of corrugated mirror-bright stain-less-steel tanks wrapped in coils of orange ceramic pipes . Here the musty-tangy smell was almost overpowering . It stimulated something like racial memory , and I thought of cool dank root cellars on warm summer  | days , filled with sweet-smelling wooden crates of apples and potatoes , hard-packed dirt floors .. . " The old vats , " Charles said . " Cuve , they were called . Juice from the grapes ? " " I can guess , " I interrupted . " I 'm something of a wine connoisseur , actually . " That was stretching the truth considerably . " Oh , really ? " Charles asked , genuinely pleased . " Then maybe you can explain more to me . I 've always wondered why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd they get their grapes ? " I asked , adopting an expert air . " Cuvee in situ . Grew them in the vats , grape cell suspension . . . Inoculated it , fermented it right where it grew . " " That 's why it failed , " I said with a sniff . " Worst wine imaginable . " So I had heard , at any rate ; I had never tried it myself . " My folks tell me it was pretty bad . Some of it 's stored around here , I think . . . Just abandoned . " " For how long ? " " Twenty years at least . " " Terrestrial years , " I said . " Right . " " I prefer Martian years , myself . " Charles took my little feints and jabs pretty well , I thought , not getting irritated , yet not backtracking to flatter me , either . " Shall we look for them ? " " Yeah , " he said . " I remember seeing them when I was a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . I lagged a few steps and peered into a glass window in the side of one cuve . Empty blackness . The whole place saddened me . How often had Martians attempted to do something the way it had been done on Earth , half inventing something , half following ancient tradition , and failing miserably ? " You know how we make wine now , do n't you ? " I asked , catching up with him . " Pure nano , all artificial , right ? " " Some of it 's not bad , either . " " Have you ever tasted Earth wine ? " Charles asked . " Good heavens , no , " I said . " My family 's not rich . " " I tasted some a few years ago . Madeira . Cost a friend four hundred Triple dollars . " " Lucky man , " I said . " Madeira used to be aged in the holds of ships , sent around the Horn . " That just about plumbed my knowledge of wine . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | * * * We pushed aside a thin fiberglass door and entered a storage area behind the vat room . Hidden behind neatly folded piles of filter cloth , a single lonely drum sat in one corner . Charles stooped beside the drum and peered at its label . " Vintage 2152 , " he said . " M.Y . 43 . Never bottled , never released . " He glanced up at me with a comic look of fearful anxiety . " Might kill us both . " " Let 's try it , " I said . The spigot plug had been turned to the wall . Charles called one of the maintenance arbeiters to bring in a forklift and move the drum . The arbeiter did its work , and we were able to tap the barrel . Charles went off to find glasses , leaving me with my thoughts in the cold , empty room . I stared at the foamed rock walls , then said , out loud , " What in hell am I doing ? " I was far from any station or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting myself into what could be a very compromising situation , going against my better judgment , much less my previous plans for just such an occasion . . . when I would have tested and picked out a very suitable candidate for a serious relationship , a significant love-match-i ng . Clearly , I did n't know my own mind . I liked Charles , he was certainly pleasant , but he was no .. . Sean Dickinson . I frowned and pinched my upper arm as a kind of punishment . If Sean Dickinson were here , I thought , we might already be in bed together . . . But I could see Sean waking in the morning , glancing at me with disapproval , taciturn after a night of passion . Was that what I wanted ? Experience of sex with the added spice of an illusion of romance , with someone I could never have a future with , and therefore no strings at-tached ? My face heated . Charles returned with two thick glasses and I pretended to examine the arbeiter for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Charles asked . I shook my head , smiling falsely . " It just looks so pitiful . " I took one of the glasses . Charles stretched his neck between nervous shoulders , clearly more unsure about me than I was about him . But he made a brave show , and with a magician 's hocus-pocus gesture , turned the stopcock and poured a thin stream of deep red liquid into his glass . " It would n't be polite to offer you some first , " he said , and lifted the glass . " It 's my family 's mistake , after all . "  | He sniffed the glass , swirled it , smiled at the pretension , and took a sip . I watched his face curiously , wondering how bad it could be . He showed genuine surprise . " Well ? " I asked . " Not fatal , " he said . " Not fatal at all . It 's drinkable . " He poured a glass for me . The wine was rough , demanding a little more throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was not nearly as bad as it could have been . " We 're young , " Charles decided . " We 'll survive . Should we decant a liter or two , have it with dinner ? " " Depends on what dinner is , " I said . " What we brought with us , and whatever I can scrounge from the emergency reserves . " " Maybe I can cook , " I said . " That would be great . " We ate in the station boss 's dining room on an old metal table and chairs that nobody had seen fit to remove . Ten-year-old music played softly over the louder system , rapid hammerbeat kinjee tunes that might have put my parents in a romantic mood , but did nothing for me . I preferred development , not drugdrum . I will not say the wine liberated me from my cares , but it did induce calm , and for that I was grateful . The food was tractable  --  gray paste at least five years old  --  Martian years  --  that fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles was embarrassingly appreciative . I had to bite my tongue not to point out that the paste did most of the work . He was trying to be nice , to make me feel good . My ambivalence was a puzzle to both of us . The air system in the old warren creaked and groaned as we finished our dinner . Outside , the boss 's station display told us , the surface temp had dropped to minus eighty Celsius and the wind was whining at a steady one hundred kiphs . I was n't worried for our safety  --  we had enough supplies to keep us for a couple of weeks . If we wished to leave , the tractor could get us through anything but a major storm , which was n't in the offing , according to satcom weather reports . We were n't in any danger , nobody knew where we were , the wine illumined a Charles more and more handsome with every sip , and still my neck ached with tension . " Tomorrow we 'll go out to the shaved flats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting his glass and staring at the wine within as if it were rare vintage . He closed one eye to squint at the color , caught my p 63 dubious expression , and laughed . His laugh might have been the first thing I fell in love with  --  easy and gentle , self-deprecating but not humble , accompanied by a roll of his eyes and a lift of his chin . " What are shaved flats ? " I asked . " Natural fractures in the limestone . Upper layers separate from lower , maybe because of vibration from the wind , and the upper layer begins to fragment . Soon  --  well , in a hundred million years  --  frost forms in the cracks , and the upper layer erodes into sand and dust , which blow away , leaving the next layer down . . . Shaved , so to speak . " " Where does the frost come from , this far south ? " I asked . " The shaving stopped about three hundred million years ago . Not enough water frost to matter any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's where fossils are . This used to be a pretty good area for ancient tests . " " Tests ? " " Shells . Most no bigger than your finger , but my great uncle found an intact Archimedes snapper about three meters long . Right here , while digging out the tunnels for this station . " " What 's an Archimedes snapper ? " I knew something about old Martian biology , enough to remember the largest creature of the tertiary Tharsis period , but I wanted to listen to Charles some more . His voice was very pretty , actually , and I had come to enjoy hearing him explain things . " Big screw-shaped jointed worm with razor-sharp spines . Spun through sea-bottom muds chopping up smaller animals , then sent out stomach tendrils to digest the bits and suck them in . " I grued delicately . Charles appreciated the effect . " Pretty grim if you were , say , a triple test jelly during mating season , " he added , finishing his glass . He lifted it toward me , inquiring without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , " I said . " So why does it sound awful ? " " More wine , awful ? " Charles asked . " I 'm not a triple test jelly , so why does an Archimedes snapper sound horrible ? " " Not used to fresh meat , " Charles said . " I 've never had meat , " I said . " It 's supposed to . . . sharpen your drives . Your instincts . " Charles lifted his glass again toward me . I wondered if he wanted me drunk . That would not be a very sporting desire , a supine woman nearly out of her senses ; would that satisfy him , or would he try for all of me , mind as well as body ?  | " No thank you , " I said . " It looks like blood . " " Venous blood , " Charles agreed , putting his half-full glass down . " I 've had enough , too . I 'm not used to it . " " I think it 's time to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I focused on his smile and specked an image of Charles and me without blankets , without clothes , in bloodwarm rooms , and felt more heat rise that was not due to the wine . I wanted to encourage him , but something still held me back . If he did not make a move now , he might miss me , and I would not have to decide whether to accept . I wondered how many women had put heavy action on Charles , and how often he had accepted  --  if ever . It would be awful if we were both inexperienced  --  would n't it ? " We have a lot to do tomorrow , " Charles said , turning his eyes away . " I 'm pleased you decided to come with me . It 's a real boost to my ego . " " Why ? " " I 'd hate to rush anything now , " he said , so softly I could hardly hear . " Rush what ? " He filled his glass of wine , then frowned and stuck out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that . I do n't want any more . You 're very tolerant . " His next words came in a rush , accompanied by quick hand gestures as if in a debate . " I 'm shy and I 'm clumsy and I do n't know what to do , or whether to do anything , and the thing I want most right now is to just talk with you , and find out why I 'm so attracted to you . But I think I should be doing something else , too , trying to kiss you or . . . Of course , I would n't mind that . " He looked squarely at me , distressed . " Would you ? " I had hoped to be guided through this by someone who could educate me . " Talking is good , " I said . Charles came forward a little too quickly , and we kissed . He put his hand on my shoulder , hugged me without squeezing , and then , instinct shoving in , began to get more insistent . I gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to show I was n't rejecting him . His face flushed and his eyes unfocused . " Let 's take it easy , " I said . We slept in separate rooms . Through the wall , I heard Charles pace and mumble . I do n't think he got much sleep that night . Surprisingly , I slept well . The next morning , I dressed , came into the kitchen and found the main arbeiter frozen in the middle of the floor . I touched it tentatively . A p 65 faint recorded voice said , " I am no longer functional . I need to be repaired or replaced . " Then it shut down completely . I made my own cup of tea and waited for Charles . He came in a few minutes later , trying not to look tired , and I warmed a cup for him . " Sleep well ? " I asked . He shook his head . " And you ? " " I slept okay . I 'm sorry you were upset . " " You 're not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm glad , " I said . " But I do n't know what you expect . " I took his hand and said , " We are going to spend a wonderful day sightseeing and looking for fossils . We 'll talk more and get to know each other . Is n't that enough ? " " It 's a start , " Charles said . We ate breakfast and suited up . " None of this was scrubbed by glaciers , " Charles said , pointing to the plain with his gloved hand . We both wore full pressure suits in the tractor cab , but our helmet visors were raised . The tractor motors ramped to a low whine as we climbed a bump in the flat expanse . " They swept by about a hundred kilometers east and fifty west . They left a melt river canyon not far from here , though . It cuts down through a couple of billion years . " We 'll pass through three layers of life descending into the canyon . The topmost layer is about a half a billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after they died . The middle layer is two billion years old . That 's the Secondary and Tertiary , Pre-shield and Tharsis One Ecos . At the bottom , in the shaved flats , is the silica deposit . " " The Glass Sea , " I said . Every Martian was given a Glass Sea fossil at some point in their childhood . Charles steered us around a basalt-capped turban of limestone . Basalt fragments from an ancient meteor impact lay scattered over the area . I tried to imagine the meteor striking the middle of the shallow ocean , spraying debris for hundreds of kilometers and throwing up a cloud of muddy rain and steam . . . Devastation for an already fragile ecology . " Makes me twitchy , " I said . " What does ? " " Time . Age . Makes our lives look so trivial . " " We are trivial , " Charles said . I set my face firmly and shook my head . " I do n't think so . Empty time is n't very . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind were  | warm , alive , interesting , but these words all seemed to reveal my feminine perspective , and Charles 's knee-jerk response had been decidedly masculine and above-it-all intellectual . " Active . No observers , " I concluded lamely . " Given that , we 're still here for just an instant , and the changes we make on the landscape will be wiped out in a few thousand years . " " I disagree , " I continued . " I think we 're going to make a real mark on things . We observe , we plan ahead , we 're organized ? " " Some of us are , " Charles said , laughing . " No , I mean it . We can make a big difference . All the flora and fauna on Mars were wiped out because they . . . " I still could n't clearly express what I wanted to say . " They were n't organized , " Charles offered . " Right . " " Wait until you see , " Charles said . I shivered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triviality . " " Let the land speak , " Charles said . I had never been very comfortable with large ideas  --  astrophysics , aiology , all seemed cavernous and dismal compared to the bright briefness of human history . In my studies I focused on the intricacies of politics and culture , human interaction ; Charles I think preferred the wide-open territories of nature without humanity . " We interpret what we see to suit our own mindset , " I said pompously . For a moment , his expression  --  downturned corners of his mouth , narrowed eyes , a little shake of his head  --  made me regret those words . If I was playing him like a fish on a line , I might have just snapped the line , and I suddenly felt terribly insecure . The touch of my glove on his thick sleeve did not seem adequate . " I still want to go and see , " I said . Charles let go of the guide stick . The tractor smoothed to a stop and jerked . He half-turned in his seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , why ? " " I feel like you 're testing me . Asking me key questions to see if I 'm suitable . " I bit my lip and looked into my lap , trying for some contrition . " I 'm nervous , " I said . " Well , so am I. Maybe we should just let up a bit and relax . " " I was just expressing an opinion , " I said , my own temper flaring . " I apologize for being clumsy . I have n't been here before , I do n't know you very well , I do n't know what ? " Charles held up his hands . " Let 's forget all of it . I mean , let 's forget  | everything that stands between us , and just try to be two friends out on a trip . I 'll relax if you will . Okay ? " I came dangerously close to tears at the anger in his tone . I looked out the window but did not see the ancient carved grotesques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know how to be different , " I said . " I 'm not good at masks . " " I 'm not either , and I do n't like trying . If I 'm not the right person for you , let 's put it all aside and just enjoy the trip . " , " I do n't know what 's making you so angry . " " I do n't know , either . I 'm sorry . " He pulled the stick forward and we drove in silence for several minutes . " Sometimes I dream about this , " he said . " I dream I 'm some sort of native Martian , able to stand naked in the Up and feel everything . Able to travel back in time to when Mars was alive . " " Coin-eyed , slender , nut-brown or bronze . Dark they were , and golden-eyed . ' " " Exactly , " Charles said . " We live on three Marses , do n't we ? The Mars they made up back on Earth centuries ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have cleared . My mood shifted wildly . I felt like crying again , but this time with relief . " You 're very tolerant , " I said . " We 're both difficult , " Charles said . He leaned to one side and bumped helmets with me . Our lips could get no closer , so we settled for that . " Show me your Mars , " I told him . The melt river canyon stretched for thirty kilometers , carving a wavering line across the flats . A service path had been carved into the cliffs on both sides , cheaper than a bridge , marring the natural beauty but making the canyon bottom accessible to tractors . " The areology here is really obvious , " Charles said . " First comes the Glass Sea , then Tharsis One with deep ocean deposits , building up over a billion years , limestone . . . Then ice sheets and eskers . . . Then the really big winds at the end of the last glaciation . " We rolled down the gentle packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side were layered with iron-rich hematite sands and darker strata of clumped till . " Wind and ice , " I said . " You got it . Flopsand and jetsand , smear , cling and grind . . . There 's a pretty thick layer of northern chrome clay . " Charles pointed to a graygreen band on our right , at least a meter deep . He swerved the tractor around a recent boulder fall , squeezed through a space barely large enough to admit us , and we came out twenty meters below the flats . Our  | treads pushed aside flopsand to reveal paler grades of grind and heavy till . " We have as many words for sand and dust as the Inuit have for snow , " Charles said . " Used to be a school quiz , " I said . " Remember all the grades of dust and sand and name them in alphabetical order . ' I only remember twenty . " " Here we are , " Charles said , letting the stick go . The tractor slowed and stopped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The high wind of the night before had settled into soft murmurs , and the air was still . A dust-free sky stretched wall-to-wall pitch-black . We might have been on Earth 's moon but for the color of the canyon and the rippled red and yellow bed of the ancient melt river . Charles enjoyed the silence . His face had a look of relaxed concentration . " There 's a rock kit in the boot . We 'll dig for an hour and return to the tractor . " He hesitated , thinking something over . " Then we 'll head home . I mean , back to the station . " We checked our gear thoroughly , topped up our air supply from the tractor 's tanks , pumped the cabin pressure into storage , and stepped through the curtain lock with a small puff of ice crystals . The crystals fell like stones to the canyon floor . " I remember this , " Charles said over the suit radio . " It has n't changed . The sand patterns are different , of course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks real familiar . I had a favorite fossil bed about a hundred meters from here . My father showed it to me . " Charles portioned out my share of tools to carry , took my gloved hand , and we walked away from the tractor . I saw two deposition layers clearly outlined in a stretch of canyon wall that had not slumped : a meter of brown and gray atop several meters of pale yellow limestone , and below that , half a meter of grays and blacks . We walked across shaved flats now , covered with sand ; the oldest limestones , and beneath , the Glass Sea bottom . I drew in my breath sharply , a kind of hiccup , startled at how this realization affected me . Old Mars , back when it had been a living planet . . . Alive for a mere billion and a half years . Where life arose first was still at issue ; Martians claimed primacy , and Terrestrials disputed them . But Earth had been a more violent and energetic world , closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , farther away from its youthful star , cooling more rapidly , had condensed its vapor clouds into seas a quarter of a billion years earlier . I believed  --  like most loyal Martians  --  that this was where life had first p 69 appeared in the Solar System . My feet pressed thin flopsand five or six centimeters above the graveyard of those early living things . " Here , " Charles said , taking us into the inky shadow of a precarious overhang . I looked up , worried by the prominence . Charles saw my expression as he stooped and brought out his pick hammer . " It 's okay , " he said . " It was here when I was a kid . Can you shine a light ? " We worked by torch . Charles pried up a slab of dense crumbling limestone . I helped lift the slab away , twenty or thirty kilos of rock , piling it to one side . Charles handed me the pick . " Your turn , " he said . " Under this layer . About a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then harder , until the layer cracked and I was able to finger and brush away the fragments , clearing a space a couple of hands wide . Charles held the torch . I peered back through two billion Martian years and saw the jewel box of the past , pressed thin as a coat of paint , opalescent against the dark strata of those siliceous oceans . Round , cubic , pyramidal , elongated , every shape imaginable , surrounded by glorious feathery filters , long stalks terminating in slender , gnarled roots : the ancient Glass Sea creatures appeared like illustrations in an old book , glittering rainbows of diffraction as the torch moved . I specked them waving in the soup-thick seas , sieving and eating their smaller cousins . " Sometimes they 'd lift from their stalks and float free , " Charles said . I knew that , but I did n't mind him telling me . " The biggest colonies were maybe a klick wide , clustered floats , raising purple fans out of the water to soak up sunlight ... " I reached down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been glued firmly against their deathbed ; they were tough , even across the cons . " They 're gorgeous , " I said . " The first examples of a Foster co-genotypic bauplan , " Charles said . " These are pretty common specimens . No speciation , all working from one genetic blueprint , making a few hundred different forms . All one creature , really . Some folks think Mars never had more than nine or ten species living at a time . Could n't call them species , actually  --  co-genotypic phyla is more like it . No surprise this kind of biology would give rise to the mother cysts . " He took a deep breath and stood . " I 'm going to make a pretty important decision here . I 'm trusting you . " I looked up from the Glass Sea , puzzled . " What ? " " I 'd like to show you something , if you 're interested . A short walk ,  | another couple of hundred meters . A billion and a half years up . Earth years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " You hiding a mother deposit here ? " He shook his head . " It 's on a secure registry , and we license it to scholars only . Father took me there . Made me swear to keep it secret . " " Maybe we should skip it , " I said , afraid of leading Charles into violating family confidences . " It 's okay , " he said . " Father would have approved . " " Would have ? " " He died on the Jefferson . " " Oh . " The interplanetary passenger ship Jefferson had suffered engine failure boosting from around the Moon five Martian years before . Seventy people had died . Charles had made a judgment on behalf of his dead father . I could not refuse . I stood and hefted my bag of tools . The canyon snaked south for almost a hundred meters before veering west . At the bend , we took a rest and Charles chipped idly at a sheet , of hard clay . " We 've got about an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes to get to where we 're going , and that means we can only spend about ten minutes there . " " Should be enough , " I said , and immediately felt like kicking myself . " I could spend a year there and it would n't be enough , " Charles said . We climbed a gentle slope forty or fifty meters and abruptly came upon a deep fissure . The fissure cut across the canyon diagonally , its edges windworn smooth with age . " The whole flatland is fragile , " Charles said . " Quake , meteor strike ... Something shook it , and it cracked . This is about six hundred million years old . " " It 's magnificent . " He lifted his glove and pointed to a narrow path from the canyon floor , across the near wall of the fissure . " It 's stable , " he said . " Just do n't slip on the gravel . " I hesitated before following Charles . The ledge was irregular , uneven , no wider than half a meter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or prick in my suit . Charles looked at me over his shoulder , already well down the ledge . " Come on , " he said . " It 's not dangerous if you 're careful . " " I 'm not a rock climber , " I said . " I 'm a rabbit , remember ? " " This is easy . It 's worth it , believe me . " I chose each step with nervous deliberation , mumbling to myself below p 71 the microphone pickup . We descended into the crevice . Suddenly , I could n't see Charles . I could n't hear him on radio , either . We were out of line of sight and he was not getting through to a satcom transponder . I called his name several times , clinging to the wall , each moment closer to panic and fury . I was looking back over my left shoulder , creeping to my right , when my hand fell into emptiness . I stopped with a low moan , trying to keep my balance on the ledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take hold of my arm . I turned and saw Charles right beside me . " Sorry , " he said . " I forgot we would n't be able to talk through the rock . You 're fine . Just step in ... " We stood in the entrance to a cave . I hugged Charles tightly , saying nothing until my hammering heart had settled . The cavern stabbed deep into the fissure wall , ending in black obscurity . Its ceiling rose five or six meters above our heads . The fissure 's opposite wall reflected enough afternoon sunlight into the cavern that we could see each other clearly . Charles lifted the torch and handed it to me . " It 's the last gasp , " he said . " What ? " I still had n't recovered my wits . " We 've gone from alpha to omega . " I scowled at him for his deliberate mystery , but he was n't looking at me . Gradually , I realized the cavern was not areological . The glass-smooth walls reflected the backwash of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard as rock stretched across the interior and flashed in my wavering torch beam . Shards of filament littered the floor like lost fairy knives . I stood in the silence , absorbing the obvious : the tunnel had once been part of something alive . " It 's an aqueduct bridge , " Charles said . " Omega and Mother Ecos . " This was n't a cavern at all , but part of a colossal pipeline , a fossil fragment of Mars 's largest and last living things . I had never heard of an aqueduct bridge surviving intact . " This section grew into the fissure about half a billion years ago . Loess and flopsand filled the branch because it ran counter to the prevailing winds . Cling and jetsand covered the aqueduct , but did n't stop it from pumping water to the south . When the Ecos failed and the water stopped , this part died along with all the other pipes , but it was protected . Come on . " Charles urged me deeper . We stepped around and under the internal supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this aqueduct  | had fed billions of hectares of green and purple lands , a natural irrigation system greater than anything humans had ever built . These had been the true canals of Mars , but they had died long before they could have been seen by Schiaparelli or Percival Lowell . I swallowed a lump in my throat . " It 's beautiful , " I said as we walked deeper . " Is it safe ? " " It 's been here for five hundred million years , " Charles said . " The walls are almost pure silica , built up in layers half a meter thick . I doubt it will fall on us now . " Light ghosted ahead . Charles paused for me to pick my way through a lattice of thick green-black filaments , then extended his arm for me to go first . My breath sounded harsh in the confines of the helmet . " It 's easier up ahead . Sandy floor , good walking . " The pipe opened onto a murky chamber . For a moment , I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hole opened to black sky and I saw stars . The glow that diffused across the chamber came from a patch of golden sunlight gliding clockslow across the rippled sand floor . " It 's a storage tank , " Charles said . " And a pumping station . Kind of like Tres Haut Medoc . " " It 's immense , " I said . " About fifty meters across . Not quite a sphere . The hole probably eroded through a few hundred years ago . " " Earth years . " " Right , " he said , grinning . I looked at the concentric ripples in the sand , imagining the puff and blow of the winds coming through the ceiling breach . I nudged loose dust and flopsand with my boot . This went beyond confidence . Charles had guided me into genuine privilege , vouchsafed to very few . " I ca n't believe it . " What ? " Charles asked expectantly , pleased with himself . I shrugged , unable to explain . " I suppose eventually we 'll bring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " My father wanted it kept in the family for a few decades , but I do n't think any of my aunts or uncles or the Klein BM managers agreed . They 've kept it closed all these years in his memory , I suspect , but they think that 's long enough , and there is the resource disclosure treaty to consider . " " Why did he want it closed ? " " He wanted to bring Klein kids here for a history lesson . Exclusively . Give them a sense of deep time . " Charles walked to the spot of sun and stood there , arms folded , his suit  | and helmet dazzling white and gold against the dull blue-green shadows beyond . He looked wonderfully arrogant , at home with eternity . That sense of deep time Charles 's father had coveted for his BM 's children stole over me and brought on a bright , sparkling shock unlike anything I had ever experienced . My eyes adjusted to the gloom . Delicate traceries lined the glassy walls of the buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital room . The natural cathedrals of Mars . All broken and flat now . . . except here . I tried to imagine the godly calm of a planet where an immense , soapbubble structure like this could remain undisturbed over hundreds of millions of years . " Have you shown anybody else ? " I asked . " No , " Charles said . " I 'm the first ? " " You 're the first . " " Why ? " " Because I thought you 'd love it , " he said . " Charles , I do n't have half the experience or the . . . awareness necessary to appreciate this . " " I think you do . " " There must be hundreds of others ? " " You asked to see my Mars , " Charles said . " No one 's ever asked be-fore . " I could only shake my head . I was unprepared to understand such a gift , much less appreciate it , but Charles had given it with the sweetest of intentions , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You overwhelm me . " " I love you , " he said , turning his helmet . His face lay in shadow . All I could see were his eyes glittering . " You ca n't , " I answered , shaking my head . " Look at this , " Charles said , lifting his arms like a priest beneath a cathedral dome . His voice quavered . " I work on my instincts . We do n't have much time to make important decisions . We 're fireflies , a brief glow then gone . I say I love you and I mean it . " " You do n't give me time to make up my own mind ! " I cried . We fell silent for a moment . " You 're right , " Charles said . I took a deep breath , sucking back my wash of emotions , clutching my hands to keep them from trembling . " Charles , I never expected any of this . You have to give me room to breathe . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his helmet . " We should go back now . "  | I did n't want to go back . All of my life I would remember this , the sort of romantic moment and scene I had secretly dreamed of , though stretched beyond what I could have possibly imagined ; the kind of setting and sweeping , impassioned declarations I had hoped for since such ideas had even glimmered in me . That it aroused so much conflict baffled me . Charles was giving me everything he had . On the way back to the tractor , with ten minutes before we started using reserves , Charles knelt and chipped a square from the Glass Sea bed . He handed it to me . " I know you probably already have some , " he said . " But this is from me . " Leave it to Charles , I thought , to give me flowers made of stone . I slipped the small slab of rock into my pouch . We climbed into the tractor , pressurized , and helped each other suck dust from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took the stick and propelled the tractor forward . We circled and climbed out of the canyon in painful silence . I made my decision . Charles was passionate and dedicated . He cared about things . We had been through a lot together , and he had proven himself courageous and reliable and sensible . He felt strongly about me . I would be a fool not to return his feelings . I had already convinced myself that my qualms before had come from cowardice and inexperience . As I looked at him then  --  he refused to look at me , and his face was flushed  --  I said , " Thank you , Charles . I 'll treasure this . " He nodded , intent on dodging a field of boulders . " In a special place in my heart , I love you , too , " I said . " I really do . " The stiffness in his face melted then , and I saw how terrified he had been . I laughed and reached out to hug him . " We are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there were tears in his eyes . I was impressed by my power to please . That evening , as the temperature outside the station dipped to minus eighty , the walls and tunnel linings of the warrens creaked and groaned , and we dragged our beds together in the boss 's sleeping quarters . Charles and I kissed , undressed , and we made love . I do n't know to this day whether I was his first woman . It did n't matter then , and it certainly does n't matter now . He did not seem inexperienced , but Charles showed an aptitude for catching on quickly , and he excited and pleased me , and I was sure that what I felt was love . It had to be ; it was right , it was mutual . . . and it gave me a great deal of plea-sure. p 75 I delighted in his excitement , and after , we talked with an ease and directness impossible before . " What are you going to do ? " I asked him , nested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I grow up , you mean ? " " Yeah . " .. He shook his head and his brows came together . He had thick , expressive eyebrows and long lashes . " I want to understand , " he said . " Understand what ? " I asked , smoothing the silky black hair on his forearm . " Everything , " he said . " You think that 's possible ? " " Yeah . " " What would it be like ? Understanding everything  --  how everything works , physics , I guess you mean . " " I 'd like to know that , too , " he said . I thought he might be joking with me , but lifting my eyes , I saw he was dead serious . " How about you ? " he asked , blinking and shivering slightly . I scowled . " God , I 've been trying to figure that out for years now . I 'm really interested in management  --  politics , I guess would be the Earth word . Mars is really weak that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said solemnly . " I 'll vote for you . " I cuffed his arm . " Statist , " I said . Waiting for sleep , I thought this part of my life had a clear direction . For the first time as an adult , I slept with someone and did not feel the inner bite of adolescent loneliness , but instead , a familial sense of belonging , the ease of desire satisfied by a dear friend . I had a lover . I could n't understand why I had felt so much confusion and hesitation . The next day , we made love again  --  of course  --  and after , strolling through the tunnels with mugs of breakfast soup , I helped Charles inspect the station . Every few years , an active station  --  whether deserted or not  --  had to be surveyed by humans and the findings submitted to the Binding Multiples Habitat Board . All habitable stations were listed on charts , and had to be ready for emergency use by anybody . Tres Haut Medoc needed new arbeiters and fresh emergency supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably needed an engineering refit to fix deep structural wear that could not be self-repaired . After finishing diagnostics on the main pumps , still caught up in yes-  | terday 's trip and my deep-time shock , I asked Charles what puzzled him most about the universe . " It 's a problem of management , " he said , smiling . " That 's it , " I said huffily . " Talk down to my level . " " Not at all . How does everything know where and what it is ? How does everything talk to every other thing , and what or who listens ? " " Sounds spooky , " I said . " Very spooky , " he agreed . " You think the universe is a giant brain . " " Not at all , madam , " he said , letting a diagnostic lead curl itself into his slate . He tucked the slate into his belt . " But it 's stranger than anyone ever imagined . It 's a kind of computational system . . . nothing but information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know how it talks to itself , and how we can listen in . . . and maybe add to the conversation . Tell it what to do . " " You mean , we can persuade the universe to change ? " , " Yeah , " he said blandly . " That 's possible ? " I asked . " I 'd bet my life on it , " Charles said . " At least my future . Have you ever wondered why we 're locked in status quo ? " Cultural critics and even prominent thinkers in the Triple had speculated on the lack of major advances in recent decades . There had been progress  --  on Earth , the escalation of the dataflow revolution  --  that had produced surface changes , extreme refinements , but there had not been a paradigm shift for almost a century . Some said that a citizen of Earth in 2071 could be transported to 2171 and recognize almost everything she saw . . . This , after centuries of extraordinary change . " If we could access the Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bookkeeping . . . " He smiled sheepishly . " We 'd break the status quo wide open . It would be the biggest revolution of all time . . . much bigger than nano . Do you ever watch cartoons ? " " What are those ? " " Animations from the twentieth century . Disney cartoons , Bugs Bunny , Road Runner , Tom and Jerry . " " I 've seen a few , " I said . " I used to watch them all the time when I was a kid . They were cheap ? public domain  --  and they fascinated me . Still do . I watched them and tried to understand how a universe like theirs would make sense . . I even worked up some math . Observer-biased reality  --  nobody falls until he knows he 's over the edge of a cliff . . . Instant regeneration of damaged bodies , no consequences , continuous flows of energy , limited time , incon-  | sistent effects from similar causes . Pretty silly stuff , but it made me think . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Maybe more than we realize ! I 'm fascinated by concepts of other realities , other ways of doing things . Nothing is fixed , nothing sacred , nothing metaphysically determined  --  it 's all contingent on process and evolution . That 's perfect . It means we might be able to understand , if we can just relax and shed our preconceptions . " When we finished the survey , we had no further excuses to stay , and only a few hours before we had to return the tractor to Shinktown . Charles seemed dispirited . " I really do n't want to go back . This place is ideal for being alone . " " Not exactly ideal , " I said , sliding an arm around his waist . We bumped hips down the tunnel from the pump to the cuvee . " Nobody bothers us , there 's things to see and places to go ... " " There 's always the wine , " I said . He looked at me as if I were the most important person in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing you for a while . " I had n't given much thought to that . " We 're supposed to be responsible adults now . " " I feel pretty damned responsible , " Charles said . We paused outside the cuvee hatch . " I want to partner with you . " I was shocked by how fast things were moving . " Law-bond ? " " I 'd strike a contract . " That was the Martian term , but somehow it seemed less romantic ? and for that reason barely less dangerous  --  than saying , " Get married . " He felt me shiver and held me tighter , as if I might run away . " Pretty damned big and fast , " I said . " Time , " Charles said with sepulchral seriousness . He smiled . " I do n't have the patience of rocks . And you are incredible . You are what I need . " I put my hands on his shoulders and held him at elbow 's length , examining his face , my heart thumping again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't nice to scare people . " He apologized but did not loosen his grip . " I do n't think I 'm old enough to get married , " I said . " I do n't expect an answer right away , " Charles said . " I 'm just telling you that my intentions are honorable . " He hammed the word to take away its stodgy , formal sense , but did n't succeed . Honorable was something that might concern my father , possibly my mother , but I was n't sure it concerned me.  | Again , confusion , inner contradictions coming to the surface . But I was n't about to let them spoil what we had here . I touched my finger to his lips . " Patience , " I said , as lovingly as possible . " Whether we 're rock or not . This is big stuff for mere people . " " You 're right , " he said . " I 'm pushing again . " " I would n't have known how good a lover you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little pushy . " I napped on the trip back to Shinktown . The tractor found its way home like a faithful horse . Charles nudged me two hours before our arrival and I came awake apologizing . I did n't want him to feel neglected . I turned to watch the short rooster tail of dust behind , then faced Charles in the driver 's seat . " Thank you , " I said . " For what ? " " For being pushy . " I was about to say , " For making a woman out of me , " but the humor might not have been obvious , and I did n't want him to think I was being flippant about what had happened . " I 'm good at that , " he said . " You 're good at a lot of things . " I had promised my family I would spend time at Ylla , my home station , before returning to school . There was a week left for that , but I had to go to Durrey to catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few more days . We parked the tractor in the motor pool garage and kissed passionately , then walked to the Shinktown station , promising to get together when school resumed . When I got back to Durrey , Diane Johara  --  again my roommate ? opened the door and smiled expectantly at me . " How was he ? " she asked . " Who ? " " Charles Franklin . " I had told her I was going on a trip Up but had n't given any specifics . " Have you been snooping ? " I asked . " Not at all . While I was out at the family farm , our room took messages . One of them is from a Charles at Shinktown depot . Where 's your slate ? " I grimaced , remembering I had left my slate in the tractor by accident . Maybe that was why Charles was calling . " I 've misplaced it , " I said . Diane lifted an eyebrow . " I looked at the list when we got back . The same Charles we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We went fossil-hunting , " I said . " For three days . . . ? " " Your nose is sharp , Diane , " I said . She followed me into my curtained area . I pulled the cot from the wall and flopped my case on the blanket . " He seemed very nice , " Diane said . " You want gory details ? " I asked , exasperated . Diane shrugged . " Confession is good for the soul . " " You must have had a boring time at the farm . " " The farm is always a dusting bore . Nothing but brothers and married cousins . But a great swimming hole . You should come with me sometime . Might meet someone you like . You 'd be good for our family , Casseia . " " What makes you think I 'd transfer my contract ? " " We have so much to offer , " she said brightly . " You 're a top pain , Diane . " I unpacked quickly and folded everything into drawers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed bleak . " Any good males in your family ? " she asked . " I 'd transfer contracts ... for someone like Charles . " A few months before , I would have stuck my tongue out at her , or thrown a pillow . Somehow that seemed undignified . I had a lover  --  was a lover  --  and that demanded maturity in some ways even more than being in the UMS action did . " All right . I went with Charles to a family station , " I admitted . " He 's nice . " " He 's pretty , " Diane said wistfully . " I 'm happy for you , Casseia . " I rolled up my bag . " Can I listen to my messages in private ? " " Now you can , " Diane said . The message from Charles made my heart pound . He was still pushing . An hour after arriving at Shinktown , Charles had recorded , " You left your slate in my bag . I 'm sending it to your home station now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm serious . I love you and I do n't think I 'll ever find another woman like you . I know you need time . But I know we can share our dreams . I miss you already . " He was more impressed with me than I was . I sat on the edge of the cot , scared out of my wits . I lay awake that night , aroused by the floating memories of Charles . It had been so confusing and so wonderful , but I knew I was too young to get married . Some did lawbond at my age : those who had morphed their futures since second form , who knew what they wanted and how to get it . If I told Charles I did not wish to marry now , he would smile and say ,  | " You have all the time you need . " And that was n't the answer I wanted to hear . The truth was , what needed to mature in me was my whole approach to mixing the inner life with the outer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why settle for something less than the best ? I shook my head bitterly , feeling so very selfish and even treasonous . Charles had given me everything . How could I refuse ? How could I think such thoughts and yet still profess , even to myself , that I loved him ? I sent a text message back , not trusting my voice : The time at Tres Haut Medoc was lovely . I 'll treasure it always . I ca n't talk about going lawbond because I am much less sure of myself than you seem to be . I want to see you as soon as possible . We need to get together with our friends and do all sorts of things before we can even think about commitment , do n't you agree ? I signed off with Love , Casseia Majumdar . I had signed letters to distant relatives that way . Not I love you , a strong declaration , but simply , tersely , Love . Charles would be hurt by that . It hurt me to write it and not change it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farewell message on the room for Diane , who was staying at Durrey to study in privacy . Then I boarded the train to North Solis . I leaned my head against the double-paned glass and looked out at nighttime Mars , at Phobos like a dull searchlight above the glooming hills west of Durrey . I am frightened , I told myself . I can never again be what I was . I can never be to another what I was to Charles . Something has ended and I am afraid . I made the trip across Claritas Fossae back to Jiddah Planum and Ylla , the bosom of my family , greeting my parents and brother with affection , falsely trying to convey a jaunty air of self-assurance , everything 's fine here , I 'm just the same as always . But I 'm a lover now , Father . Mom , I 've had a man , and it was wonderful . . . I mean , he was wonderful , and I think I 'm in love , but it 's going very fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really talk .. . Charles did not respond for three days . Perhaps he had plumbed the depths of my character and decided he had made a serious mistake . Perhaps he had seen through to my basic immaturity and insincerity and decided to write me off as a Shinktown sweet after all . My slate was delivered by postal arbeiter , but I had already ordered another , not trusting the room to record all my messages . I could not  | concentrate on planning my next octant 's curriculum . I was a nervous wreck . I hated the suspense and uncertainty . I had felt I was in control and had lost that control and now it was my turn to be played on the line like a fish . Irritation turned to numb sadness . But I did not call him . At the end of three days , as I undressed for a very lonely bed , Charles called me direct . I robed and took his call in my room . His image came clear as life over my bed . He looked exhausted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm really sorry I 've been out of touch , " he said . " I wish we could talk in person . It 's been a nightmare here . " " What 's wrong ? " I asked . " Our BM has had all of its Earth contracts severed . I had to fly to McAuliff Valley for a family meeting . I 'm there now . God , I 'm sorry , you must have thought ? " " I 'm fine , " I said . " I did n't hear anything on the nets . " " It 's not public yet . Do n't tell anybody , Casseia . I think we 're being voided because our Lunar branch is starting up major prochine operations in Lagrange . Earth does n't like it . The Greater East-West Alliance , actually , but it might as well be the whole Earth . " GEWA  --  pronounced Jee-wah , an economic union of Asia , North America , India and Pakistan , the Philippines , and parts of the Malay Archipelago  --  had been causing problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it really that bad ? " " We ca n't ship any goods to Earth , and we ca n't exchange process data with GEWA signatories . " " How does that affect you ? " I asked . " We 're looking at a cross-the-board loss for the next five Earth years . My scholarship is down the tubes , " Charles said . " I had hoped to join the Trans-Mars Physics Co-op for my fifth-form studies . If Klein ca n't ante up , I ca n't pay my share , and I do n't even go to fifth form . " " Damn , " I said . " I know how much that means ? " " It puts everything on hold , Casseia . What you said . . . about taking time to think things through . . . " His voice shook and he worked to control it . " Casseia , I ca n't possibly go lawbond , I do n't have any prospects for scholarship ? " " It 's okay , " I said . " I feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought , maybe we can ? " " Yeah . " I hurt for him .  | " I 'm sorry . " " You do n't need to be . " " I love you so much . " " Yeah , " I said . " I want to see you . As soon as I 'm free here  --  we have some family decisions to make , consensus on BM direction , response , and so on ? " " Serious . I know . " " I want to get together . At Durrey , when we go back , or at Ylla , wherever . No pressure , just . . . see you . " " I want to see you , too . " He reaffirmed that he loved me , and we mumbled our way through farewells . His image faded and I took a deep breath and got a drink of water . Charles was in trouble and that took pressure off me , and I felt guilty relief . I knew I had to talk to someone , soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . I called Diane . She answered with vid off , then switched it on . She wore a ragged blue robe she had treasured since girlhood . She had caked her hair with Vivid , a mud-colored treatment she was addicted to . It rolled slowly on her scalp . " I know , I know , I 'm ugly , " she said . " What 's up ? " I told her about Charles 's situation . I told her he had asked me to lawbond and that we could n't now . That I was and had been very con-fused . She whistled and dropped onto her cot . " Lightspeed kind of guy , is n't he ? " she asked , narrowing her eyes . Talking remote was never the same as being in the same room , especially for a good heartfelt , but Diane 's manner cut the distance . " You told him to go slow , I hope . " " I do n't think he can . He sounds so in love . " " That 's either wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He is so sincere and . . . he 's so sweet , I feel guilty not dropping my tanks and digging in . " " Well , he 's your first , and that 's sweet alone . But you 're not telling Aunt Di how you feel . Do you love him ? " " I 'm worried I 'm going to hurt him . " " Ah . I mean , uh-oh . " " You sound experienced , " I said testily , knotting my fingers . " I wish I were . Casseia , stop pacing and relax . You 're giving me an ache . " I sat . " You went with him to Tres Haut Medoc . He was n't just climbing into p 83 your suit . You must have seen something special in him . Do you love him ? " " Yes , " I said . " But you do n't want to lawbond . " " Not right away . " " Ever ? " I shook my head , neither yes nor no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , because he 's pretty and kind . I know that already . " " No such , Casseia . Although I 'm a bit envious . He is smart , he was good  --  I assume ? " " He was very good , " I cried . " And he 's willing to wait . So wait . " I pressed my lips together and stared at her . " What if I decide not to lawbond ? Would that be fair ? He 'd have wasted time on me ... " " God , Casseia , I hope no sophisticated Terrie ever hears this . We Martians are such serious folk . Love is never wasted . Do you want to dump him now and try someone else ? " " No ! " I said angrily . " Hey , it is an option . Nobody 's forcing you to do anything . Do n't forget that . " Talking with her simply dropped me deeper . " I feel really terrible now , " I said . " I 'd better go . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this ? " " Because if I love him , I should feel differently . I should feel all one way , not three ways . I should be happy and giving . " " You 're ten years old , Casseia . Young love is never perfect . " " He uses Earth years , " I lamented . " Ah , a fault ! What other faults does he have ? " " He 's so smart . I ca n't understand anything about his work . " " Take a course . He does n't want you for a lab assistant or fraulein arbeiter , does he ? " " When I 'm away from him , I do n't know what to feel . " Diane wrinkled her face in disgust . " All right , we 're running in circles . Who 's waiting in a side tunnel ? " " Nobody , " I said . " You know how men react to you . You 're attractive . Charles is n't the only slim and randy buck on Mars . You can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? You know his family is n't rich . . . his BM is in trouble with Earth . . . he wants to be a physicist and understand everything . He 's pretty , he 's gentle , he 's rugged on the Up . . . God , Casseia , I 'm going to hit you if you just void him ! "  | I shook my hanging head . " I 've got to go , Diane . " " Sorry I 'm not helping . " " It 's okay . " " Do you love him , Casseia ? " she asked again , eyes sharp . " No ! " I fumbled to hit the vid off . I missed . " Do n't cut me now , roomie , " Diane said . " You do n't love him at all ? " " I ca n't . Not now . Not one hundred per . " " You 're positive ? " I nodded . " Could you come to love him , someday ? " I stared at her blankly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One hundred per ? " " Probably not . No . I do n't think so . " " Be kind , then . Tell him honestly how you feel right now . " " I will . " She looked away for a moment , then brought up her slate . " You know me , " she said . " Always squirreling . Well , I have something interesting here , if you want to know about it . " " What ? " I asked . " Charles may be rugged on the Up and good in bed , but he has plans , Casseia . Have you checked up on your friend ? " " No . " " I always make sure I know as much as possible about my male friends . Men can be so tortuous . " I wondered what she was going to throw at me now , and my shoulders tensed : that he was actually a Statist , that he had been spying for Caroline Connor in the trench domes . " This does n't toss any sand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles wants to be a real physicist , Casseia . He 's applied to be a subject for enhancement research . " " So ? It 's the pro thing . Even Majumdar accepts it . " " Yeah . And on Earth , everybody does it . But Charles has applied to be hooked to a Quantum Logic thinker . " I fell silent for a moment . " Where d-did you learn that ? " " Open records , medically oriented research applications , UMS . He put in the request early last summer , before the trench domes . " My insides sank . " Oh , God , " I said . " Hey , we do n't know much about such a link . " " Nobody can even talk to a QL thinker ! " I said . " I did n't want to puddle your dust , Casseia , but I thought you 'd want to know . " p 85 " Oh . " " When will you be back ? " I mumbled an answer and cut the vid . My head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be angry or to cry . On Mars , we had escaped most of the ferment of enhancements and transforms and nanomorphing commonplace on Earth . We were used to low-level enhancements , genetic correction , and therapy for serious mental disorders , but most Martians eschewed the extreme possibilities . Some were n't available off Earth ; some just did n't suit our pragmatic , pioneer tastes . I think the cultural consensus was that Mars would let Earth and , to a lesser extent , the Moon try the radical treatments , and Mars would sit the revolution out for a decade or two and await the results . If what Diane had learned was true  --  and I could n't think of any reason to doubt her  --  Charles seemed ready to zip right to the cutting edge . What had been youthful ambivalence before ramped to near-panic now . How could I maintain any kind of normal relationship with Charles when he would spend much of his mental life listening to the vagaries of Quantum Logic ? Why would he want that in the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better physicist . Quantum Logic reflected the way the universe operated at a deep level . Human logic ? and the mathematical neural logic of most thinkers  --  worked best on the slippery surface of reality . What I knew of these topics , I had picked from school studies and mass LitVid , where physically and mentally enhanced heroes dominated Terrie youth programming . But in truth , I understood very little about Quantum Logic or QL thinkers . One last question chased me through the rest of the day , through dinner with my parents and brother , through the BM social hour and tea dance later in the evening , into a sleepless bed : Why did n't Charles tell me ? He had n't given me everything , after all . Early the next morning , my mother and I planned my education through the next few years . I was n't in the mood , but it had to be done , so I put on as brave and cheerful a face as I could manage . Father and Stan had gone to an inter-BM conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had traditionally served the Majumdar BM by directing the family 's involvement in Triple finances , and Stan was following that road . I was still interested in management and political theory , even more now p 86 that I had spent a few months away from such courses . The UMS action , and my time with Charles , had sharpened my resolve . Mother was a patient woman , too patient I thought , but I was grateful to have her sympathy now . She had never approved of political process ; my grandmother had left the Moon in protest when it had reshaped its constitution , and her daughter had retained a typical Lunar sense of rugged individualism . Both Mother and I knew what I owed to the family : that beginning in another year or so , I would become useful to the BM , or get lawbonded , transfer , and become useful to another BM . Political studies did not seem particularly useful to anybody at this time . Still , if I wanted to study state theory and large-scale govmanagement , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite protest . That took about five minutes , and I sat stolidly , hearing her through . She discussed the difficulties of politics in BM-centered economies ; she told me that the best and most lasting contributions could be made within one 's own BM , or as a BM-elected representative to the Council , and even that was something of a chore and not a privilege . She made her points , a restrained but heartfelt version of Grand-mother 's Lunar cry of " Cut the politics ! " and I said in reply , " It 's the only thing that really interests me , Mother . Somebody has to study the process ; the BMs have to interact with each other and with the Triple . That 's just common sense . " She leaned her head to one side and gave me what Father called her enigma look , which I had seen many times before , and never been able to describe . A loving , suffering , patiently expectant expression , I can say now after decades of thought , but that still does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have meant , " Yes , and it 's the world 's third-oldest profession , but I would n't want my daughter doing it . " " You 're not going to change your mind , are you ? " " I do n't think so . " " Then let 's do it right , " she said . We sat in the dining room , poring over prospectuses as they flitted around us in stylish picts and texts , symbols and previews of various curriculums vying to draw us in deeper . Mother sighed and shook her head . " None of these are very enticing , " she said . " All entry-level stuff . " " A few look interesting . " " You say you 're serious about this . " " Yes . " " Then Martian political theory wo n't be enough . It 's small grit compared to Terrie boulders. " p 87 " But Terrie eds are expensive ? " " And probably biased toward Earth history and practices , God for-bid , " she added . " But they 're still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want to ask for something nobody else in the family has got-ten . " " Why not ? " she asked brightly , enjoying the chance to seem perverse . " It does n't seem right . " " Nobody in our branch of Majumdar has gone out for govmanagement . Finance , economics , but never system-wide politics . " " I 'm a freak , " I said . She shook her head . " Recognizably my daughter , however . I 'll clear for it if you really want it . " " Mother , we could n't afford more than a year ? " " I 'm not talking about autocourse eds , " she said . " If you aim for the stars , pick the bright ones . The least you should settle for is a Majumdar scholarship and apprenticeship . " I had n't even dreamed of such a thing . " Apprenticed to whom ? " She made a wry face . " Who in our family knows the most about politics , particularly Earth politics ? Your third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and the BM pedagogues approve . I could n't get that for you by myself ; I 'm still a bit of an outsider at that level . I 'm not sure your father could pull enough strings and call in enough favors . We 've only met Bithras three times since you were born  --  and he 's never met you ? " " What would I do ? " " Inter-BM affairs , and of course Triple affairs . Attend the Council meetings , I assume , and study the Charter and the business law books . " " It would be perfect , " I mused . " Next best thing to a real government to study . We tend to neglect that kind of management at the station level , and for that I 'm thankful . " " But I 'd still need Terrie autocourses to fill out my currie . " She smiled cagily . " Of course . " She touched my nose lightly with her finger . " But they would n't go on our tab . All educational costs for apprenticeship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've been giving this some thought behind my back , " I accused . " I 've put up with your eccentricities , " she said with a lift of her chin and stretch of her neck , " because we try to encourage independent thinking in our young folks . We hope they 'll experiment . But I honestly never thought I 'd see a daughter of mine go into politics ? " " Govmanagement , " I amended . " For a career , " she said . " I 'm put off by it , of course , and I 'm also  | intrigued . After a few years studying the Council , what can you teach me when we argue ? " " We never argue , " I said , hugging her . " Never , " she affirmed . " But your father thinks we do . " I let her go and stood back . With this much resolved , I needed to solve another problem . " Mother , I 'd like to ask somebody to visit Ylla . Somebody from Durrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty bad news ? " " Charles Franklin from Klein , " my mother said . I had n't mentioned him . She smiled and gave me another enigma look . " His mother called to see if you were worthy of her son . " My shock must have showed . " How could she ? " And behind that question , How could he talk about me with his parents ? " Her only child is very important to her . " " But we 're adults ! " " She seemed nice and she did n't ask any leading questions . She thinks Charles is a wonderful young man , of course , and from what she tells me , I do n't disagree . I assume you think he 's wonderful . Is he ? " I sputtered , trying to express my indignation . She put a finger to my lips . " It 's traditional for us to drive you crazy , " she said . " Think of it as revenge for when you were two years old . Charles is welcome any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million prospective citizens , a little less the population of the old United States in 1800 . Some prospective citizens were Eloi emigrating from Earth , starting fresh on Mars , where going for Ten Cubed  --  a life span of at least one thousand Earth years  --  was not just accepted , but ignored . Earth forbade life spans artificially extended much over two hundred years , forcing the Eloi to emigrate elsewhere or reverse their treatments . Mars accepted a hefty fee from Earth for taking in each and every Eloi  --  though it was not widely advertised . Some immigrating to Mars were pioneers pure and simple , heading out from Earth or Moon to find a simpler and more basic existence . They must have found Mars a disappointment we had long since spun beyond the era of foamed rock insulation and narrow tunnels between trench domes . I met Charles at the Kowloon depot , ten kilometers from our home warrens at Ylla . As Charles took his bag from the arbeiter , I spotted Sean Dickinson in a train window . Even with less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized thinkers ) spread  | out over a land area equal to Earth 's , Mars was positively cozy . You could n't help running into people you knew , wherever you went . Sean and I exchanged cordial nods . I pointedly embraced Charles . Sean watched us impassively as the train slid out of the depot . " I am incredibly glad to see you , " Charles said . I made a warm sound and squeezed his hand . " That was Sean , " I said . " Did you see him ? " " Sat with him , " Charles said . " He seems more cheerful than when we last met . He told me to apologize for making stupid accusations against you . He 's going south . I did n't ask where . " " That 's nice , " I said , and my face warmed . " Welcome to Jiddah Planum . Accountants , investment analysts , small engineering firms . No fossils to speak of , even Glass Sea . " " You 're here , and that 's enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lounge and booked tickets for the return . Ylla dug into the northern outskirts of Jiddah Planum . Smaller , slower trains fanned from Kowloon to Jiddah and Ylla and even smaller stations east . Charles 's face seemed thinner . We had been apart for just over a week , yet he had changed drastically in both feature and mood . He held me dose as we boarded our train , and fell back into his seat with a sigh . " God , it is good to see you , " he said . " Tell me what you 've been doing . " " I told you in my letters , " I said . " Tell me in person . I worried , just getting letters . " " Letters require much more effort , " I said . " Tell me . " I told him about applying for a Majumdar apprenticeship . He approved without reservation . " Brave and noble Casseia , " he said . " Go right to the top in the face of tradition . " " Just my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty neutral about politics . " " We 're none of us going to be neutral for long , " Charles said . " Klein is wounded . Others are going to be hit next . " " By Earth ? By GEWA ? " He shrugged and looked out the window at the dull ochre prairies and shallow , kilometer-wide valleys and ditches called fossas . " We 're some sort of threat . Nobody seems to know what sort , but they 're using obvious muscle on us . We 're going to the Charter Council next week to ask for solidarity and relief . " " Relief ? " I was incredulous ; Martian BMs rarely asked for relief . So much had to be conceded with competing BMs to get inter-family guar-antees.  | " We 're in big trouble , as I said . I hope Majumdar misses all this . " " What will you do if you get the Council to call for solidarity ? That 's the step before appealing for unified action by all the BMs ? " " Shh , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use that word , united . " He smiled , but the smile was not convincing . " How did you get time off to come here ? " " I 've done my share and more in the planning phase . I have three days before I return . " " The next eighth at Durrey starts in four days , " I said . " I 'll have to miss it . " " You 're quitting school ? " " Family emergency sabbatical , " he said . " I 'll be on call until the crisis passes . " " That could put you a year behind ... " " Martian year , " Charles said , patting my arm . " I 'll make it . Just my luck to be in a vulnerable BM . If you 're going into high-level govmanagement , maybe we can transfer your contract . . . " Suddenly that was n't funny . I turned away , unable to hide my irritation , and Charles was dismayed . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and persuade you to .. . and you said . . . I know , Casseia , I 'm sorry . " " Never mind . " He was missing the cause of my anger , could n't possibly understand  --  not yet . " We have a lot to talk about , Charles . " " So serious , " he said . He closed his eyes and leaned against the headrest . " This is n't going to be a vacation ? " " Of course it is , " I said . That was n't quite a lie . Charles arrived in the middle of a most unusual paucity  --  most of my blood relations and relations by marriage , who normally trooped through Ylla and our warrens like a herd of friendly cats , had trooped elsewhere , spreading out across Mars on errands or vacations . We would have a rare time of privacy , and neither Charles nor I would have to suffer the staring eyes of curious urchins , impolite questions from my aunts , hints of liaisons from my elder cousins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty and quiet , and for this I was supremely grateful . Ylla occupied sixty hectares of an almost featureless prairie of little interest but for aquifers and solid ice lenses . Prospectors had mapped out a chain of stations along the Athene Aquifer in the first decade of the Mars expansion , thirty years ago ; three of a possible six had been built , Ylla the first . It had originally been known as Where 's Ylla . The lack of sentient Martians had disappointed few . Martian settlers p 91 landing on their new home , and taking station assignments , quickly became hard-bitten and practical ; it was no picnic . Keeping a station open and staying alive was tough enough in those decades without having to deal with unhappy natives . Still , I had played Ylla as a girl , and my brother had played the defensive Mr. Ttt with his gun of golden bees , stalking human astronauts .. . I related much of this nervously to Charles as the small train whined over the ditches and onto the main prairie , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable . I had asked Charles to come to Ylla to ask him a question I now thought rude and unnecessary ; rude , because he would have mentioned his desire to be enhanced had he wished to , and unnecessary , because I was determined to end our brief relationship . But I could n't simply tell him on the train . And I could n't tell him at dinner . My parents of course went all-out with this meal , celebrating the first time I had brought a young man to our station . Father was particularly interested in Charles , asking endless questions about the Terrie embargoes on Klein . Charles answered politely and to the best of his knowledge ; there was no reason to keep any of this secret from someone as highly placed as Father . My parents generally eschewed nano food , preferring garden growth and syn products . We ate potato and syn cheese pie and fruit salad and for dessert , my father 's syn prime cheesecake with hot tea . After dinner , we sat in the memory room , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the inevitable living shadow box from Earth , the self-cycling fish tank , the small , antique wall-mount projectors for LitVid . I loved my parents , and what they felt was important to me , but their immediate and natural affection for Charles was distressing . Charles fit right in . He and my father leaned forward in their chairs , almost knocking heads , talking about the possibility of hard financial times ahead , like old friends . Inevitably , Father asked him what he planned to do with himself . " A lot of things , " Charles answered . " I 'm much too ambitious for a Martian . " Mother offered him more tea . " We do n't see any reason why Martians should n't be ambitious , " she said , lips pursed as if mildly chiding . " It 's simply impractical to do what I want to do , here , at this time , " Charles said . He shook his head and grinned awkwardly . " I 'm not very practical . " " Why ? " Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with me , I thought , and he spends this time talking with my parents . . . about what he is going to do in physics . " Mars does n't have the research tools necessary , not yet , perhaps not for decades , " Charles said . " There are only two thinkers on the planet dedicated to physics , and a few dozen barely adequate computers tied up in universities with long waiting lists . I 'm too young to get on any of the lists . My work is too primitive . But . . . " He stopped , hands held in midair , parallel to each other , emphasizing his point with a little jerking gesture . " The work I hope to do would take all of Earth 's resources . " " Then why not go to Earth ? " my father asked . " Why not ? " I put in . " It would be a marvelous experience . " " No chance , " Charles said . " My grades are n't perfect , my psych evaluations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass rigid tests . . . We have to be ten times better than any Terrie . " My father smelled a young man with ambitions but insufficient drive . " You have to do what you have to do , " he said gruffly . Instantly I was on Charles 's side , saying abruptly , " Charles knows what to do . He knows more than most Terrestrials . " My father lifted an eyebrow at the vehemence of my defense . Charles took my hand in appreciation . " Worse scholars than you have filtered through , " Father said . " You just have to know how to handle people . " " I do n't know anything about handling people , " Charles said . " I 've never known anything but how to be straight with them . " He looked at me as if that were a trait I might admire , and though I thought it disingenuous , not admirable , I smiled . Concern passed from his face in a flash , replaced by adoration . His brown eyes even crossed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not wanting to have such an effect on him . I wanted to be away from my parents , alone with Charles , to express my affection but tell him this was not the time . I felt horrible and a little queasy . " Casseia would go to Earth in a moment if the opportunity arose , " my mother said . " Would n't you ? " She grinned at me proudly . I stared at the fish tank , sealed decades ago on Earth , lovingly tended by my father and given to my mother on the day of their nuptials . " No-body 's offered , " I said . " You 're good , though , " Charles said . " You can jump the hurdles . You have a way with people . " " Our sentiments exactly , " Father said , smiling proudly . " She just needs a little self-confidence . Support from people other than her parents . " * * * p 93 Father took me aside while Mother and Charles talked . " You 're not happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your mother sees it  --  Charles must see it . Why ? " I shook my head . " This is going all wrong , " I said . " You like him . " " Why should n't we ? " " I asked him here . . . to talk with him . And I ca n't be alone with him to talk ... " Father smiled . " You can be alone later . " " That is n't why I 'm unhappy . You 're examining him as if I 'm going to lawbond him . " My father narrowed one eye and stared at me like a prospector examining a vein in rock . " He meets my approval so far . " " He 's a friend , and he 's here to talk . I 'm not asking for your approval . " " We 're embarrassing you ? " " I just have some important things to talk about with him , and this is taking so much time . " " Sorry , " Father said . " I 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory room . Slowly , my father pried Mother away from the conversation and suggested we inspect the tea garden . When they were gone , Charles settled back contentedly , well-fed and relaxed . " They 're good people , " he said . " I can see where you come from . " He could have said anything and it would have irritated me . This irritated me more . " I 'm my own woman , " I said . He lifted his hands helplessly and sighed . " Casseia , you 're going to tell me something . Tell me now . You 're driving me muddy . " " Why did n't you say you applied for a link ? " He frowned . " Pardon ? " " You 've applied to link with a QL thinker . " " Of course , " he said , face blank . " So has a third of my physics fourth form . " " I know what a QL thinker is , Charles . I 've heard what it can do to people . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It does n't do them any good as human beings , " I said . " Is that what 's going wrong between us ? " " No . " " Something is going wrong , though . " " What kind of life would there be for someone . . . " I was getting myself into a mire and could n't find a solid path out . " Married to a QL ? " He seemed to think that was funny . " It was a  | whim , Casseia . It 's been talked about on Earth . Some of our senior physicists think it could help break tough conceptual problems . It would be temporary . " " You did n't tell me , " I said . He tried to skirt the issue . " I 'll never get the chance now , " Charles said . " But you did n't tell me . " " Is that what 's upsetting you ? " " You did n't trust me enough to tell me . " I could n't believe we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid the words I knew would be hurtful , words I actually had no clear reason for saying . Here was Charles directly in front of me . Part of me  --  an energetic and substantial part  --  wanted to apologize to him , to take him to the tea garden and make love with him again . I would not allow that . I had reached my decision and I would follow through , no matter how painful for both of us . " I have a lot of growing to do , " I said . " So do I. We ? " " But not together . " His mouth went slack and his eyes half-lidded . He looked down , closed his mouth , and said , " All right . " " We 're both too young . I 've enjoyed our time together . " " You invited me to meet your parents before telling me this ? That 's hardly fair . You 've wasted their time . " " They like you as much as I do , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was familiar with , because this is n't easy for me to say . I do love you . " " Urn hm . " He would n't look at me directly . He kept searching the walls as if for a way to escape . " You wanted me to tell you about future plans that might never have happened , to get you upset over something ... probably impossible . And you 're disappointed . " " No . " I thrust my jaw forward , pushing ahead despite the confusion , only now understanding the core of my response . " I 'm telling you straight . Later , perhaps , when we 've achieved something , when our minds are settled , when we know what we want to do ? " " I 've known that since I was a boy , " Charles said . " Then you should have picked somebody more like you . I do n't know what I 'm going to do , or where it 's going to take me . " Charles nodded . " I pushed too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop that , " I said . " You sound like a . . " What ? "  | " Never mind . " I just looked at him , eyes wide , trying to show the real affection I felt for him by the way my eyes tracked the points on his very fine face . " You 're not happy , are you ? " he asked . " We ca n't grow up in a couple of months , " I said . He held up his hands . " I want to be with you , make love with you , reach out to you . . . watch you when you go to sleep . " I found that a particularly frightening picture : domestic coziness . Not what I imagined I needed at all . Youth is a time for adventure , for many changes , not for commitment and life spent on a fixed path . " You could teach me so much about politics and the way people work together . I need that . I think so far into the abstract I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder if I 'll ever be ready for that , " I said . " It might be better if we stayed friends . " " We must always be friends , " he said . " Just friends , for now , " I added gently . " Wise Casseia , " he said after a few seconds of silence . " I apologize for being so clumsy . " " Not at all , " I said . " It 's charming , really . " " Charming . Not convincing . " " I do n't know what I want , Charles , " I said . " I have to find out for myself . " " Do you believe in me ? " he asked . " If you do , you 'd know life with me will never be dull . " I gave him a glance partly puzzled , partly irritated . " I 'm going to do important things . I do n't know how long it will take me , Casseia , but I have glimmers even now . Places where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own  --  I do n't show it at the university  --  it 's pretty good stuff . Not seminal , not yet , but pretty good , and it 's only the warm-up . " I saw now , for the first time , another side of Charles , and I did not like it . His face wrinkled into a determined frown . " You do n't have to convince me you 're smart , " I said peevishly . He took my shoulders , hands light but insistent . " It is n't just being smart , " he said . " It 's as if I can see into the future . I 'll be doing really fine work , great work , and I sometimes think , whoever my partner is , she helps me do that work . I have to choose my partner , my friend , my lover , very carefully , because it is n't going to be easy . " I could have finished the conversation then with a handshake and a firm good-bye . I did not like this aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , I thought , yet he was full of himself , a raging egotist ,  | full of such big ideas . " I have my own work to do , " I said . " I need to be more than just somebody 's partner , just a support for their work . " " Of course , " he said , a little too quickly . " I have to follow my own path , not just glue myself to someone and be dragged along , " I said . " Oh , of course . " His face wrinkled again . Charles , please do n't cry , damn it , I thought . " There 's so much inside , " he said . " I feel so strongly . I ca n't express myself adequately , and if I ca n't do that , I certainly ca n't convince you . But I 've never met a woman like you . " You have n't met many women , I thought , not very kindly . " Wherever you go , whatever we end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . I took his hand then , feeling this was an appropriate if not perfect way to get out of a tough situation . " I really feel strongly about you , Charles , " I said . " I 'll always care for you . " " You do n't want to get married , something I ca n't do now anyway , and you knew that . . . So you do n't want me to consider you a steady partner , or anything else , either . You do n't want to see me again . " " I want the freedom to choose , " I said . " I do n't have that now . " " I 'm in your way . " " Yes , " I said . " Casseia , I have never been so embarrassed and ashamed . " I stared at him without comprehending . " You have a lot to learn about men . " " Of course . " " About people . " " No doubt . " " And you do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to make this end so soon ? " " Nothing ! " I cried . I would n't be able to control myself much longer . It was agony to realize that after this , Charles would have to stay the night ; there were no trains to the Kowloon depot at this hour . We would have to face each other in the morning , with my parents about . " I would like to live alone , on my own , and make my own life and see what I 'm capable of , " I said , half-mumbling . My eyes filled with tears and I lifted my head to keep them from spilling down my cheeks . " Do n't wait for me . That is n't freedom . " He shook his head rapidly . " I did something wrong . " " No ! " I shouted . We had n't left the memory room . I took his arm and led him to the p 97 warren hub , then opened the door to the tea garden tunnel . I pushed him through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder-shaped cell ten meters below the surface . Dense green bushes thrust from walls , ceiling , and floor toward a rippling sheet of portable sun . The leaves rustled in the circulating air . I held his arm and stopped at the south end of the cell . " I 'm the one who 's done something wrong , " I said . " It 's me , not you . " " It felt so obvious . So true , " Charles said . " Maybe it would have been , three years from now , or five . But we 've missed the timing . Who knows what we 'll be doing then . " Charles sat on a bench . I sat beside him , wiping my eyes quickly with a sleeve . Only a few years ago I had given up playing with dolls and burying myself in LitVids about girlhood in Terrie Victorian times . How could this have come so fast ? " On Earth , " Charles said , " they teach their kids all about sex and courtship and marriage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We make mistakes out of ignorance . " " I 'm ignorant , all right , " I said . Our voices had returned to a normal tone of conversation . We might have been discussing a tea competition . Martians dearly love their tea ; I prefer pekoe . And you ? " I wo n't apologize any more , " he said , and he took my hand . I squeezed his fingers . " I meant what I said . And I tell you now .. . whenever you 're ready , wherever we may be , I 'll be there for you . I wo n't go away . I chose you , Casseia , and I wo n't be happy with anyone else . Until then , I 'll be a friend . I wo n't expect anything from you . " I wanted to jump up and scream , Charles , that is just so dumb , you do n't get what I 'm saying . . . But I did n't . Suddenly , I saw Charles very clearly as an arrow shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even to relax and play ; a straight and honest man who would in fact be a wonderful and loving husband . But not for me . My course could not follow his . I might never hit my mark , and I doubted our two marks would ever be the same . I realized that I would miss him , and the pain became more intense than I could bear . I left the tea garden . My father showed Charles the guest room . After , Father came to my room . The door was sealed and I had turned the com off , but I heard his knock through the steel and foam . I let him in and he sat on the edge of my cot . " What is going on ? " he asked . I cried steadily and silently .  | " Has he hurt you ? " " God , no , " I said . " Have you hurt him ? " " Yes . " Father shook his head and curled his lip before assuming a flat expression . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter . But I 'm going to tell you something and you can take it for what it 's worth . Charles seems to be in love with you , and you 've done something to attract that love ... " " Please , " I said . " I took him to the guest room and he looked at me like a lost puppy . " I turned away , heartsick . " Did you invite him here to meet with us ? " " No . " " He thought that was your reason . " " No . " " All right . " He lifted one knee and folded his hands on it , very masculine , very fatherly . " I 've wondered for years what I would do if anybody hurt you  --  how I 'd react when you started courting . You know how much I love you . Maybe I was naive , but I never gave much thought to the effect you might have on others . We 've raised you well . .. " " Please , Father . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you something about your mother and me that you do n't know . Just think of it as fulfilling a duty to my sex . Women can hurt men terribly . " " I know that . " I hated the whine in my voice . " Hear me out . Some women think men are pretty hard characters and should get as good as they give . But I do n't approve of your carelessly hurting men , any more than I 'd approve if Stan started hurting women . " I shook my head helplessly . I just wanted to be alone . " Family history . Take it for what it 's worth . Your mother spent a year choosing between me and another man . She said she loved us both and could n't make up her mind . I could n't stand the thought of sharing her , but I could n't let go , either . Eventually , she drifted away from the other man , and told me I was the one , but . . . it hurt a lot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish I could be gallant and understanding and forgiving , but I still ca n't hear his name without cringing . Life is n't simple for people like us . We 'd like to think our lives are our own , but they 're not , Casseia . They 're not . I wish to God they were . " I could not believe Father was telling me such things . I certainly did not want to hear them . Mother and Father had always been in absolute  | love , would always be in love ; I was not the product of whims and unstable emotions , not the product of something so chaotic as what was happening between Charles and me . For a few seconds I could hardly talk . " Please go , " I said , sobbing uncontrollably , and he did , with a muttered apology . The next morning , after a breakfast that lasted forever , I accompanied Charles to Kowloon depot . We kissed almost as brother and sister , too much in pain to say anything . We held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-conscious drama . Then Charles got on the train and I turned and ran . The forces were building . Klein asked for but did not receive guarantees of solidarity , and there was a split in the BM Charter Council . Earth and GEWA asked more Martian BMs to sign more stringent agreements favorable to Earth . There were more embargoes against bigger BMs , and some folded into each other , facing pernicious exhaustion of funds  --  bankruptcy . Even the largest unaffected BMs realized that the system of independent families was headed for a breakdown ; that solidarity in the face of outside pressure would soon not be a choice , but a necessity . The first time around , my application for a syndic apprenticeship was turned down . I switched from Durrey back to UMS and resumed studies at the much-reduced govmanagement school . I applied for the apprenticeship again six months later , and was rejected again . Bithras Majumdar , syndic of Majumdar BM and my third uncle , had been summoned to Earth in late 2172 , M.Y . 53 , to testify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hemisphere . Bithras 's testimony could have been transmitted and saved us all a lot of money . Politicians and syndics seldom do much unrehearsed talking in public . But the arrogance of Earth was legendary . GEWA -- -the Greater East-West Alliance  --  had emerged as the greatest economic and political power on Earth . Within GEWA , the United States had kept its position as first among equals . Still , it was generally accepted on Mars that GEWA was using the United States to express its strong disappointment with Mars 's lack of progress toward unification . Thus , the United States wanted to hold direct talks with , and take direct testimony from , an influential Martian . It seemed in a perverse way all very romantic and adventurous ; and if everybody had been practical , I probably would never have been offered the chance to go to Earth . Even the most dedicated red rabbit looked  | upon Earth with awe . Whatever our opinions of her heavy-handed politics , her feverish love of overwhelming technology , her smothering welter of biological experiment , her incredible worldliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , and that was something we all wanted to try at least once . So , having failed twice , I applied again , and this time , I believe ? though she never confessed  --  that my mother pulled strings . My application went further than it had ever gone , my level of interviewing rose several ranks  --  and finally I was led to understand that I was being seriously considered . The last time Charles and I saw each other , in that decade , was in 2173 . While waiting for a decision on my application , I served a quarter as a Council page at Ulysses and worked in the office of Bette Irvine Sharpe , mediator for Greater Tharsis . Working for Sharpe was great experience ; being given that job , my mother thought , was a sign of high BM favor . I attended a barn dance held to raise funds for Tharsis Research University , newly established and already the bright spot for Martian theoretical science , as well as the center of Martian thinker research . Charles was there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not approve of . We saw each other under the beribboned transparent dome erected for the occasion on a fallow rope field . I wore a deliberately provocative gown , emphasizing what did not need emphasizing . Charles wore university drab , a green turtleneck and dark gray pants . Charles managed to separate from the clutches of his friend , and we faced each other over a table covered with fresh , newly-designed vegetables . He told me I looked wonderful . I complimented his clothes , not honestly ; they were dreadful . He seemed calm , but I was nervous . I still felt guilt over what had happened between us ; guilt , and something else . Being near him made me uncomfortable , but I still thought of him as a friend . " I 've applied for a syndic apprenticeship . I 'd like to go to Earth , " I said . " There 's a good chance I 'll get it . I might go to Earth with my Uncle Bithras . " Charles said he was pleased for me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be gone for two years . A Martian year . " " It 'll flash , " I said . He looked dubious . " I told you I 'd always be willing to be your part-ner , " he said . " You have n't exactly been waiting , " I said , a sudden wash of anger and embarrassment coloring my face , sharpening of my tone . p 101 Charles was quicker on his feet now and more experienced with people . " You have n't been very encouraging . " " You never called , " I said . He shook his head . " You were the one who said good-bye , remember ? I have a few tatters of pride . If you changed your mind , I figured you would call me . " " That 's pretty arrogant , " I said . " Relationships are mutual . " He braced himself to say something he did n't want to say and looked away . " Your world has grown too large for me . Waiting does n't seem practical . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're becoming everything I knew you would be . I wish you all the best . I will love you always . " He bowed , turned , and walked away , leaving me totally flustered . I had approached him as an old friend , and he had brought up this uncomfortable thing that I thought we had both left behind , just as I told him about what promised to be the greatest accomplishment of my young life . Such pure emotional blackmail deserved my deepest contempt . I walked briskly across the tarp-covered field and palmed into a rest kiosk . There I stood by a gently flowing resink and stared into the single round mirror , angrily asking why I felt so terrible , so sad . " Good riddance , " I tried to convince myself . I never disliked Charles , never found in him anything I did not admire . Yet even now , with a century of living between me and her , I ca n't bring myself to call that young woman a fool . I tell all this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I look back now and see the relentless roll of events , building across the next seven Martian years to the greatest event in human his-tory . Trivial pain , trivial lives . The shiver of specks of dust ramping to the storm .  | You can go home again , but it will cost you . In the late twenty-second century , travel between Mars and Earth mained a corporate or government luxury , or a jape of the very rich . passenger of average mass traveling from Earth to Mars , or Mars Earth , would pay some two million Triple dollars for the privilege . The rest had to settle for sending their messages by lightspe dataflow , and that put a natural wall between one-on-one conversatio From Earth to the Moon , reply delay is about two and two-this seconds , just enough to catch your breath and not quite enough to lc your chain of thought . To Mars , delay varied with the planetary dap from forty-four minutes to just under seven . The art of conversation lapsed early between Earth and Mars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I WAS A FINALIST FOR THE APPRENTICESHIP , I BEGAN FU ously re-studying Earth politics and cultural history . I had already go far beyond what most Martians are taught in the course of normal education ; I had become , somewhat unusually on Mars , a Terraphile . Nov needed to be an expert . I had some idea of the kinds of questions I would be asked ; I kn there would be interviews and tough scrutiny ; but I did not know w would be conducting the examinations . When I learned , I could n't deci whether to be relieved or nervous . Ultimately , I think I was relieved . T first interview would be with Alice , Majumdar 's chief thinker.  | The interview was conducted in Ylla , in an office reserved for more formal , inter-family business meetings . I dressed slowly that morning , taking extra care with the fresh clothes as they formed beneath the mat on my bed . I scrutinized myself in a mirror and in vid projection , looking for flaws inside and out . I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deliberately choosing a longer route through family display gardens , offset from the main tunnels , filled with flowers and vegetables and small trees growing beneath sheets of artificial sun . Thinkers were invariably polite , infinitely patient , with pleasant personalities . Also smarter than humans and faster by a considerable margin . I had never spoken with Alice before , but I knew my uncle had established a specific set of criteria for his apprentice . I had little doubt that she would speck me soundly and fairly . But taking into account my age and lack of experience , that little doubt quickly magnified into a bad case of nerves . A few minutes early , I presented myself to the provost of selection , an unassuming , monk-faced , middle-aged man from Jiddah named Peck . I had met Peck while going through scholarship prep . He tried to put me at ease . " Alice 's hookup is clean and wide , " he said . " She 's in a good mood today . " That was a small joke . Thinkers did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were never dominated by them . Unlike myself . The mood dominating me came close to panic . I murmured I was ready to begin . Peck smiled , patted my shoulder as if dealing with a child , and opened the door to the office . I had never been here before . Dark rosewood paneling , thick forestgreen metabolic carpet , lights lurking serenely behind brass fixtures . A young girl with long black hair , wearing a frilly white dress  --  Alice 's image  --  seemed to sit behind the opal-matrix desk , hands folded on the polished black and fire-colored stone . Alice had been named after Lewis Carroll 's inspiration , Alice Liddell , and favored Liddell 's vividly animated portrait as an interface . The image flickered to reveal its unreality , then stabilized . " Good morning , " she said . She used a dulcet young woman 's voice . " Good morning . " I smiled . My smile , like Alice , flickered to announce its illusory nature . " We 've worked together once before , but you probably do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I admitted .  | " When you were six years old , I conducted a series of history LitVids from Jiddah . You were a good pupil . " " Thank you . " " For some months now , Bithras and Majumdar BM have been preparing to journey to Earth to deal directly with various partners and officials there . " " Yes . " I listened intently , trying to focus on the words and not on the image . " Bithras will take two promising young people from the family to Earth with him , as apprentice assistants . The apprentices will have important duties . Please sit . " I sat . " Does my appearance make you uncomfortable ? " " I do n't think so . " It was odd , facing a young girl , but I decided ? forced myself to decide  --  that it did not bother me excessively . I would have to learn to work closely with thinkers . " Your ed program is ideal for what Bithras will require in an apprentice . You 've strongly favored government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dataflow cultures . " " I 've tried , " I said . " You 've also investigated Earth customs , history , and politics in some detail . How do you feel about Earth ? " " It 's fascinating , " I said . " Do you find it appealing ? " " I dream about it . I 'd love to see it real . " " And Earth society ? " " Makes Mars look like a backwater , " I said . I did not know  --  have never known  --  how to dissemble . I doubted Alice would be impressed by dissembling , anyway . " I think that 's generally agreed . What are Earth 's strengths , regarded as a unit ? " " I 'm not sure Earth can be thought of as a unit . " ( ( Why ? ) , " Even with com and link and ex nets , common ed and instant plebiscite . . . there 's still a lot of diversity . Between the alliances , the unallied states , the minorities of untherapied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars more or less diverse ? " " Less diverse and less coherent , I 'd say . " " why ? " . " Earth 's people are over eighty percent therapied or high natural . They 've had a majority of designer births for sixty Earth years . There 's  | probably never been a more select , intelligent , physically and mentally healthy population in human history . " " And Mars ? " I smiled . " We value our kinks . " " Are we less coherent in our management and decisions ? " " No question , " I said . " Look at our so-called politics  --  at our attempts to unify . " " How do you think that will affect Bithras 's negotiations ? " " I ca n't begin to guess . I do n't even know what he  --  what the BM or the Council plans to do . " " How do you perceive the character of the United States and the alliances ? " I cautiously threaded my way through a brief history , conscious of Alice 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex subject . By the end of the twentieth century , international corporations had as much influence in Earth 's affairs as governments . Earth was undergoing its first dataflow revolution ; information had become as important as raw materials and manufacturing potential . By mid-twenty-one , nanotechnology factories were inexpensive ; nano recyclers could provide raw materials from garbage ; data and design reigned supreme . The fiction of separate nations and government control was maintained , but increasingly , political decisions were made on the basis of economic benefit , not national pride . Wars declined , the labor market fluctuated wildly as developing countries joined in  --  exacerbated by nano and other forms of automation  --  and through most of the dataflow world a class of therapied , super-fit workers arose , highly skilled and self-confident professionals who demanded an equal say with corporate boards . In the early teens of twenty-one , new techniques of effective psychological therapy began to transform Earth culture and politics . Therapied individuals , as a new mental rather than economic class , behaved differently . Beyond the expected reduction in extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptable , effectively more intelligent , and therefore more skeptical . They evaluated political , philosophical , and religious claims according to their own standards of evidence . They were not " true believers . " Nevertheless , they worked with others  --  even the untherapied  --  easily and efficiently . The slogan of those who advocated therapy was , " A sane society is a polite society . " With the economic unification of most nations by 2070 , pressure on the untherapied to remove the kinks and dysfunctions of nature and p 107 nurture became almost unbearable . Those with inadequate psychological profiles found full employment more and more elusive . By the end of twenty-one , the underclass of untherapied made up about half the human race , yet created less than a tenth of the world economic product . Nations , cultures , political groups , had to accommodate the therapied to survive . The changes were drastic , even cruel for some , but far less cruel than previous tides in history . As Alice reminded me , the result was not the death of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a rebirth of sorts . New , higher standards , philosophies , and religions developed . As individuals changed , so did group behavior change . At the same time , in a feedback relationship , the character of world commerce changed . At first , nations and major corporations tried to keep their old , separate privileges and independence . But by the last decades of twentyone , international corporations , owned and directed by therapied labor and closely allied managers , controlled the world economy beneath a thin veneer of national democratic governments . Out of tradition  --  the accumulated mass of cultural wishful thinking  --  certain masques were maintained ; but clear-seeing individuals and groups had no difficulty recognizing the obvious . The worker-owned corporations recognized common economic spheres . Trade and taxation were regulated across borders , currencies standardized , credit nets extended world-wide . Economics became politics . The new reality was formalized in the supra-national alliances . GEWA  --  the Greater East-West Alliance  --  encompassed North America , most of Asia and Southeast Asia , India , and Pakistan . The Greater Southern Hemisphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , South America , New Zealand , and most of Africa . Eurocon grew out of the European Economic Community , with the addition of the Baltic and Balkan States , Russia , and the Turkic Union . Non-aligned countries were found mostly in the Middle East and North Africa , in nations that had slipped past both the industrial and dataflow revolutions . By the beginning of the twenty-second century , many Earth governments forbade the untherapied to work in sensitive jobs , unless they qualified as high naturals  --  people who did not require therapy to meet new standards . And the definition of a sensitive job became more and more inclusive . There were only rudimentary Lunar and Martian settlements then , with stringent requirements for settlers ; no places for misfits to hide . The  | romance of settling Mars proved so attractive that organizers could be extremely selective , rejecting even the therapied in favor of high naturals . They made up the bulk of settlers . All settlements in the young Triple accepted therapy ; most rejected mandatory therapy , the new tyranny of Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an exam to a looser conversation . Alice made the change so skillfully I hardly noticed . I wondered what it had been like to live in a world of kinks and mental dust . I asked Alice how she visualized such a world . " Very interesting , and far more dangerous , " she answered . " In a way there was greater variety in human nature . Unfortunately , much of the variety was ineffective or destructive . " " Have you been therapied ? " I asked . She laughed . " Many times . It is a routine function of a thinker to undergo analysis and therapy . Have you ? " " Never , " I said . " I do n't seem to have any destructive kinks . May I ask you a question ? " " Certainly . " I was beginning to feel at ease . If Alice found me inadequate , she was n't giving any signs . " If Earth is so fit and healthy , why are they putting so much pressure on Mars ? Does n't therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other individuals and organizations . But goals must still be established and judgments made . " " Okay . " I felt the heat of argument rise in me . " Say we are both operating from the same set of facts , and I disagree with you . " " Do we share the same goals ? " " No . Say our goals differ . Why ca n't we pool our resources and compromise , or just leave each other alone ? " " That may be possible as long as the goals are not mutually exclusive . " " Earth is pressuring Mars , and conflict is possible . That implies we 're involved in a game with only one winner , winner take all . " " That is one possibility , a zero-sum game . Yet it is not the only type of game in which conflict may result . " I sniffed dubiously . " I do n't understand , " I said , meaning , l do n't agree . " Hypothetical situation allowed ? " " Go ahead . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have the feeling you 've modeled this at a much higher level ... " " Yes , " Alice answered . I laughed . " Then I 'm outclassed. "  | " I do n't mean to offend . " " No , " I said . " I just wonder why I 'm bothering to argue . " " Because you are never satisfied with your present condition . " " I beg your pardon ? " " You must never cease from improving yourself . From my point of view , you are an ideal human partner in a discussion , because you never close me off . Others do . " " Does Bithras close you off ? " " Never , though I have made him furious at times . " " Then go on , " I said . If Bithras can take it , so can I. Alice described in words and graphic projections an Earth rapidly approaching ninety percent agreement in spot plebiscites  --  the integration of most individual goals . Dataflow would give individuals equal access to key information . Humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the individuals being at once integrated  --  reaching agreement rapidly on solutions to common problems  --  but autonomous , accepting diversity of opinion and outlook . I wanted to ask What diversity ? Everybody agrees ! but Alice clearly had higher , mathematical definitions for which these words were mere approximations . The freedom to disagree would be strongly defended , on the grounds that even an integrated and informed society could make mistakes . However , rational people were more likely to choose direct and uncluttered pathways to solutions . My Martian outlook cried out in protest . " Sounds like beehive political oppression , " I said . " Perhaps , but remember , we are modeling a dataflow culture . Diversity and autonomy within political unity . " " Smaller governments respond to individuals more efficiently . If everybody is unified , and you disagree with the status quo , but ca n't escape to another system of government  --  is that really freedom ? " " In the world-wide culture of Earth , dataflow allows even large governments to respond quickly to the wishes of individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantaneous , and constant . " I said that seemed a bit optimistic . " Still , plebiscites are rapid . Dataflow encourages humans to be informed and to discuss problems . Augmented by their own enhancements , which will soon be as powerful as thinkers , and by connections with even more advanced thinkers , every tier of the human organization acts as a massive processor for evaluating and determining world policy . Dataflow links individuals in parallel , so to speak . Eventually , human groups and thinkers could be so integrated as to be indistinguishable .  | " At that point , such a society exceeds my modeling ability , " Alice concluded . " Group mind , " I said sardonically . " I do n't want to be there when that happens . " " It would be intriguing , " Alice said . " There would always remain the choice to simulate isolation as an individual . " " But then you 'd be lonely , " I said , with a sudden hitch in my voice . Perversely , I yearned for some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a larger truth , a greater , unified effort . My Martian upbringing , my youth and personality , kept me isolated and in constant though not extreme emotional pain , with little sense of belonging . I deeply wished to belong to a just and higher cause , to have people ? friends  --  who understood me . To not be lonely . In a few clumsy , halting sentences , I expressed this to Alice as if she were a confidant and not an examiner . " You understand the urge , " Alice told me . " Possibly , being younger , you understand it better than Bithras . " I shuddered . " Do you want to belong heart and soul to something greater , something significant ? " " No , " Alice said . " It is merely a curiosity to me . " I laughed to relieve my embarrassment and tension . " But for people on Earth ... " " The wish to belong to something greater is an historical force , recognized , sometimes fought against , but regarded by many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars in its present condition , very scary , " Alice agreed . " Earth 's alliances disapprove of our kinks , ' as you call them . They desire rational and efficient partners , of equal social stability , in an economically united Solar System . " " So they put pressure on us , because we 're a rogue planet . . . You do n't think Martians want to belong to something greater ? " " Many Martians place a high premium on their privacy and individual-ity , " Alice said . " Frontier philosophy ? " I asked . " Mars is remarkably urbanized . Individuals are tightly knit into economic groups across the planet . This does not much resemble families or individuals isolated on a frontier . " " Have you and Bithras discussed Earth 's goals ? " " That is for him to tell you . " " All right , " I said . " Then I 'll tell you what I think , all right ? " Alice nodded . p 111 " I think Earth has some greater plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way . Eventually , they 'll want to tame and control Mars as they 've already done with the Moon . And then they 'll work on the Belters , the asteroids and space settlements . . . bring us all into the fold , until their central authority controls all the resources in the Solar System . " " That is close to my evaluation , " Alice said . " Have you spent much time in simulated Earth environment ? " " No , " I confessed . " There is much to be learned by doing so . You may also wish to put on a simulated Terrestrial personality , just to understand . " " I 'm really not into that much . . . technical intimacy , " I said . " May I say this is also typical of Martians ? You must understand your counterparts intimately to engage in effective negotiations . I guarantee they will have studied Martian attitudes in detail . " " If they become us , wo n't they think like us ? " " This is a curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agree with their thinking . Understanding is not becoming , is not agreeing . " " All right , " I said . " So what happens if the entire Earth links up and we deal with a group mind ? Why should that increase their need for resources ? " " Because the goals of a highly integrated mentality will almost certainly be more ambitious than those of a more disparate organization . " " Nobody 's ever satisfied with what they have ? " " Not in human experience ; not at the level of governments , nations , or planets . " I shook my head sadly . " What about you ? " I asked . " You 're more powerful and integrated than I am . Are you more ambitious ? " " By design , I serve human needs , and am content to do so . " " But legally you 're a citizen , with rights like me . That should include the right to want more . " " Equal in law is not equal in nature . " I worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image smiled . " I 've enjoyed our conversation very much , Casseia . " " Thank you , " I said , suddenly remembering why this meeting had been arranged . I sobered . " It 's been great . . . fun . " " That is a compliment to me . " I itched to ask the obvious question . " I will relay my evaluation to Bithras . " " Thank you , " I said meekly .  | " There will of course be interviews with humans . " " Of course . " " Bithras usually does not interview . " I had heard that before , and found it odd . " He places high trust in his associates , and in me , actually , " Alice said , still smiling . And not much trust in his own judgment ? " Oh . " " We will talk again later , " she said . Her image stood and the provost , Peck , opened the door to the office and entered . I said good-bye . " How did I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have n't grit of an idea , " he said . I waited anxiously for six days . I remember being more than testy  --  I was intolerable . Mother defended me before my irritated father ; my brother , Stan , simply stayed out of my way . More relatives crowded the warrens , my aunt 's family and her four adolescent children . I tried to hide as much as possible , unable to decide whether I was some sort of social leper or a chrysalis about to become a butterfly . I spoke once with Diane , now an apprentice instructor at UM Durrey , but did n't tell her about the interview . I half-believed in jinx . The support of friends and family , I thought , might attract the attention of vicious deities , looking for all-too-fortunate young women who needed to be cut down to size . On the sixth day , my slate chimed its melody for an official message . I retreated from the hall outside our family quarters to my room , sealed the door , lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my pocket , propping it up before me . I took a deep breath and scrolled the words . Dear Casseia Majumdar , Your application to serve as an apprentice to Syndic Bithras Majumdar of Majumdar BM has been approved . You will act as his assistant on the upcoming journey to Earth . You will meet with Bithras soon . Please prepare your affairs quickly . ( signed ) Helen Dougal Secretary to the Syndic , Majumdar BM A shiver took me . I lay back on the bed , wondering whether I would laugh or throw up . I was spinning right to the center of power , if only to observe . * * * p 113 The other lucky apprentice was an earnest fellow from Majumdar 's station in Vastitas Borealis , Allen Pak-Lee . Allen was two years older than me . I had met him briefly at UMS . He seemed quiet and sincere . We were also taking a registered copy of Alice . Majumdar BM was paying , at discount , about seven and a half million to ferry the four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she weighed less than twenty kilos . As secretary and apprentice negotiator I would spend a lot of time with my third uncle . Bithras , a perpetual bachelor almost three times my age , was legendary for his tendency to seek the female . Our family relationship presented no absolute obstacle to him ; I was not blood , and while liaisons within BMs were mildly discouraged , they were common enough . I knew this going into the job  --  I thought I could handle the situation . I had been told his advances were reasonably diplomatic and that he took rebuffs without loss of face or resentment ; I was also told that in public he would act fatherly and protective , and that in many respects he was honorable , intelligent , and kind . " But if you go to bed with him , " my mother told me as she helped me pack , " you 're sunk . " " Why ? " I asked . " Because he 's a conservative old sodder , " she said . " He professes to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But  --  and this I learned from one of his partners  --  he hates sex . " " I 'm confused , " I said , packing a cylinder of raw cloth into the single steel case allowed for the journey . " He 's like a dog that adores the hunt but does n't enjoy killing the fox . " I laughed , but Mother raised her eyebrows and pinched her lips . " Believe me . He lives for his work , and for an unmarried man of his stature , sex can be messy , irrational , and potentially dangerous . He has to live with this other self , a self he has never been able to control . But this is a prime opportunity for you . " I made a face and folded my medicine kit into the case . " Poke it , " mother said . I poked the kit and it squirmed . " It 's fresh , " I said . " I did n't know he was such a monster . Why does anybody put up with him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't exist , we 'd have to invent him . Think of him as a family rite of passage . Resist his advances with humor and cleverness , and he 'll do anything in the world for you . And once he has your measure , he 'll stop pushing . " She surveyed the perfectly  | packed case with a critical eye , then nodded approval . " I envy you , " she said wistfully . " I 'd love to go to Earth . " " Even traveling with Bithras ? " " There is n't a chance in hell you or I would go to bed with him . " She winked . " We have such good taste . But what an opportunity . . . Resist the beast , and come out the other side still a virgin , covered with gold and jewels . " " Well . . . " I said . Two days before we were to depart , Bithras summoned me to his offices in Carter City in Aonia Terra . I boarded the train in Jiddah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depot . Carter was where most of Majumdar BM 's staff lived , the locus of long-range planning ; it was Bithras 's home , as well . I had never met Bithras and I was more than a little nervous . Helen Dougal met me at the depot and escorted me as we took a cab through the transit tunnels . Helen was an attractive woman of twenty Martian years who appeared not much older than me . Carter had a population of ten thousand BM members and several hundred applicants , most of them Terries immigrating because of Eloi laws on Earth . It was a big town , yet run efficiently , and the tunnels and warrens were large and well-designed . It did n't seem crowded and haphazard , as did Shinktown , nor cleanly officious , like Durrey ; but it certainly was n't cozy and familiar , like Ylla . The presence of so many Terries ? a few of them exotic transforms  --  at times gave it a very unMartian atmosphere . Helen fed my slate background on the subjects to be discussed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Study it later , " she said . " Right now , Bithras wants to meet his new assistant . " " Of course . " I detected no envy in Helen Dougal 's face . I wondered why Bithras was n't taking her instead of me  --  wondered if she thought I was moving in on her meal pan . Since I was a little younger in appearance . . . certainly in age .. . With what I had heard , anything might be possible . I must have gone a little distant , for Helen smiled patiently and said , " You 're an apprentice . I have nothing to fear from you , nor you from me . " How about from Bithras ? " And believe me , a lot of what you 've heard about our syndic is pure dust . " " Oh . " " Advocates and family representatives meet this afternoon at fifteen . p 115 First , however , you 're going to join Bithras and me for lunch . Allen PakLee is still in Borealis . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was held in a dining hall outside Bithras 's main office . I had expected moderate luxury , but the setting was Spartan : box nano food , hardly inspiring , and packaged tea served from ancient battered carafes in worn cups , on tables that must have had pioneer metal in them . Bithras entered , clutching his slate and cursing in what I first took to be Hindi ; later I learned it was Punjabi . He sat peremptorily at the table ? it is n't easy to sit down hard on Mars , but he did his best . The slate skittered a few centimeters across the table and he apologized in perfect , rapid English . He was dark , almost purple , with intense eyes and handsome features puffing in his middle years . His head was topped with a short stiff brush of black hair lacking any gray . Thick arms and legs , well-muscled for a Martian , stuck out assertively from a short body . He wore a white cotton shirt and tennis shorts . Low-court tennis was Bithras 's favorite sport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , and shook his head in frustration . Then he looked up , his eyes glittering like a little boy 's , and beamed a broad smile . " Getting acquainted ! My niece , my new apprentice and assistant ? " I rose from my seat and bowed . He did the same , and reached across the table to shake my hand . His eyes lingered on my chest , which hardly invited scrutiny beneath a loose jumpsuit . " You come highly recommended , Casseia . I have great expectations . " I blushed . He nodded briskly . " I had thought we would have time for a lunch alone , but not so  --  we start work immediately . Where are the advo-cates ? " The door opened and six of Majumdar BM 's most prominent advocates and managers entered . I had met four of them at social functions over the years . Three male , three female , they , too , wore white shirts and shorts , and towels draped around their necks , as if they had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many crucial characters assembled in one room : my first taste of being at the center . Bithras greeted each with a familiar nod . Introductions were ignored . I was here for my own benefit , not theirs . " Now I will begin , " he said . " We are an unhappy planet . We do not satisfy Earth . That is sad enough , but actually our progress is slow from any point of view ; nobody can agree how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again . It has been more than a year since the end of the Statist government , and all we have managed  | is to patch the Council back together and hold interim meetings . Economics have slid , and we are in worse condition than before Dauble threw her hammers . This has hurt trade . We do not have a single entity governing trade ; Earth organizations must work with every BM separately , and contend with zealous district governors . We still run scared of actually cooperating in our own mutual interests , of being caught again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He folded his hands . " We are hurting ourselves . There must be an end to recriminations as to who agreed with Dauble and who did not . We must stop punishing lunar and Earth sympathizers with exclusion from the Council . As you know , I have been meeting with the syndics of the twenty largest Mars-based BMs for the past few months to put together a proposal for Martian unification , working behind and around the Council . I go to Earth with a package to present , and I present it to the Council for debate this evening . You have studied it . . . It is quick , it is dirty , it has handicaps . I 'm giving you a final chance to criticize it , from a selfish perspective . Tell me something I do not know . " " It curtails the rights of BMs to control their own trade , " said Hettie Bishop , chief advocate . " I know we must organize , but this is too damned Statist . " " Again I ask , tell me something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors more power than ever , " said Nils Bodrum from Argyre . " The governors are in love with their duties and their lands . Some of them think Mars is a natural paradise to be preserved . We 've had six Triple loan deals fall through because we could n't guarantee quick answers to resource requests . We strangle in conservationist tape . " Bithras smiled . " So , get to your point , Nils . " " If governors keep hewing to a preservation line , and we give them more power , we can say good-bye to billions of Triple dollars . Triple money wo n't back our resource digs . We 'll have to curtail settlements and turn down Terrie immigrants . That wo n't make anybody happy , least of all Earth . Where will they send their seekers after eternity ? For each Eloi refugee ? " " Immigrant , " Hattie Bishop said wryly . " Immigrant , ' I remind this august assembly , we are paid a million Triple dollars . And that money flows first through Majumdar banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Earth wants the governors stronger , " Bodrum concluded , folding his hands . " They are pushing for a unified government and for BMs to concede power , " said Samuel Washington of Bauxite in the Nereidum Mountains .  | " That 's been their goal for ten years . And they 're willing to exert considerable pressure . " " What kind of force can they use ? " Hettie Bishop asked . Beside her , Nance Misra-Majumdar , the eldest of our advocates , chuckled and shook her head . " lino hundred and ninety thousand Terrie immigrants on Mars have arrived in the last ten years . They 've found their way into high and trusted positions in every BM , some work on the Council ... " " What are you getting at , Nance ? " Hettie asked . Nance lifted her shoulders . " They used to be called fifth columnists , " she said . " All of them ? " Bithras asked sardonically . Nance smiled patiently . " Our thinkers are manufactured on Earth . It may be years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nano factories come from Earth , or the designs at least . " " No one has ever found irregularities in any designs or software , " Hettie said . " Nance , we have no reason to be paranoid . " Bithras lifted his chin from his hand and spun his chair halfway . " I see no reason to anticipate trouble , but Nance is right . In theory , there are many ways we could be undermined without facing a massive military expedition across space , which at any rate has never been feasible , even for so rich and powerful a world as Earth . " I could hardly believe such things were being discussed . I was at once dubious , repelled , and fascinated . Nils Bodrum said , " We have no organized defenses . That much could he said for a central authority  --  easier to raise an army and defend our planet . " Bithras was clearly not pleased by the direction the conversation was taking . " Friends , this is not a serious problem , certainly not yet . Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they have targeted the largest financial BM  --  ourselves -- to catalyze unification . If you pardon the word . " " Why should unification be a dirty word ? " Hettie said . " My God , as an advocate , I tell you , I 'd love to find a way out of the morass of special cases and fooleries we call our Charter . " " The Moon went through this decades ago , " Nance said . " Since the Schism , when Earth could not afford to administer such far-flung worlds and we took our leave ? " " Sounds a note of history vid , " Nils said with a grin . Nance continued after the slightest pause for a glare , " We have wran-  | gled and tangled our way into perpetual unrest . The Moon found a solution , changed its constitution ? " " And was reabsorbed by Earth , " Nils said . " Independent in dreams only . " " We are much farther away , " Hettie said . Nils would not be swayed . " We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find our own path , our own best solution . " Bithras sighed heavily . " My esteemed advocates tell me what I already know , and they say it over and over . " " When you take this suggestion for compromise to Earth , " Hettie said , " how do you expect them to believe you can make it stick in the Council ? Preliminary agreement is one thing . . . " Bithras 's features expressed extreme distaste . " I am going to tell Earth , " he said , " that Majumdar BM will put a hold on further Triple dollar transactions for any BM that does not sign . " Nils exploded . " That is treasonous ! We could be sued by every BM on this planet  --  and rightly so ! " " What court would hear them ? " Bithras asked . " We have no effective court structure on Mars , not since Dauble . . . Our own advocates pressed suit against Dauble on Earth , not Mars . What court on Earth would hear a suit pertaining only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My friends , how long has it been since a BM sued another BM ? " " Thirty-one years , " Hettie said glumly , chin in hand . " And why ? " Bithras pursued , slapping his palm on the table . " Honor ! " Nils cried . " Nonsense , " Nance said . " Nobody has wanted to prick the illusion . Every BM is a rogue , an outlaw , and the Council is a polite sham . " " But it works ! " Nils said . " Advocates negotiate , talk to each other , settle things before they ever reach court . We work around the governors . For Majumdar to put the very existence of other BMs in jeopardy is unconscionable ! " " Perhaps , " Bithras said . " But the alternative is worse . Earth will doubtless make many threats if we do not act soon . And one of them will be complete embargo . No more designs , no more technical assistance . Our newer industries would be badly damaged , perhaps crippled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persisted , but without conviction . " My friends , I have offered you a chance to make comments on this proposed constitution , " Bithras said . " You have until sixteen this evening . We are all aware of the dangers . We are all aware of the mood of Earth toward Mars . "  | " I had hoped to persuade you to drop this farce , " Nils said . " That is not an option . I am only a figurehead on this would-be ship-of-state , my friends , " Bithras said . " I go to Earth hat in hand , to avoid disaster . We are only five millions . Earth is thirty thousand millions . Earth wants access to our resources . She wants to control our resources . The only way for us to maintain our freedom is to put our house in order , concede to Earth enough to put off the next confrontation a few more years , perhaps a decade . We are weak . Buying time is our best hope . " " They 'll force a Statist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then mold that government to their own ends , and when we 're done , they 'll own us body and soul . " " That is a possibility , " Bithras admitted . " That 's why we must stab ourselves in the back , as Nils would call it , first . " Bithras went to the Council alone and presented the proposals he had worked out with the five top Martian BMs . The debate was furious ; nobody liked the choices , but nobody wanted to be the first to attract Earth 's anger . Somehow , he managed to glue together something acceptable . Bithras sent Allen and me messages after the session concluded . My dear young assistants , All Martians are cowards . The proposals are agreed to . Salve ! The trip began with a farewell dinner in the departure lounge of Atwood Star Harbor near Equator Rise , west of Pavonis Mons. Friends , family and dignitaries came to the port to see us off . For security reasons , Bithras would board the shuttle at the last minute . There had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past few days , ever since the announcement of his departure to Earth . Some suspected disgruntled Statists ; others looked to the smaller BMs , who had least to gain and most to lose . My mother , father and brother sat in a corner of the lounge , near a broad window overlooking the port . Blunt white shuttle noses poked up through half-open silo hatches . Red flopsand formed smooth streaks cross the white pavement . Arbeiters engaged in perpetual cleanup roamed the field . We spoke in bursts , with long moments of silence in between : Martian reserve . My mother and father tried not to show their pride and sadness . Stan simply smiled . Stan always smiled , in good times or bad . Some misjudged him because of that , but due to the shape of his face , it was easier for him to smile than not .  | Father took me by both shoulders and said , " You 're going to do great . " " Of course she will , " my mother said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Father continued . " We ca n't stand an empty house . " " The hell we will , " Mother said . " Stan will leave in a few months ? " " I will ? " Stan said . His protest carried an odd note ; surprise beyond the jest . " And we 'll have the warren to ourselves for the first time in ten years . What should we do ? " " Replace the carpets , " Father said . " They do n't groom themselves as well as they used to . " I listened with a mix of embarrassment and grief . What I wanted , right now , was to retreat and cry , but that was not possible . " You will make us proud , " Father said , and then , to make his point , in a louder voice , he said it again . " I 'll try , " I murmured , searching his face . Father and I had never quite communicated ; his love had always been obvious , and he had never slighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I knew ; yet it was Father who never surprised me , and Mother who never failed to . " We wo n't drag this out , " Mother said firmly , taking my father 's elbow for emphasis . Mother and I hugged . I squeezed her hard , feeling like a little girl , wanting her to sit me on her lap and rock me . She pulled back , smiling , tears in her eyes , and actually pushed me away , gently but firmly . Father gripped my hand with both of his and shook it . He had tears in his eyes , as well . They turned abruptly and left . Stan stayed longer . We stood apart from the crowd , saying little , until he cocked his head to one side , and whispered , " They 're going to miss you. , , " I know , " I said . " So will I. " " It 'll flash , " I said . " I 'm going lawbond , " he said , sticking his jaw out pugnaciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " From Cailetet ? " " Yeah . " " Stan , Father hates Cailetet . They 're pushy and Lunar . We 've never been able to share with them . " " Maybe that 's why I love her . " I stared at him in astonishment . " You 're amazing , " I said .  | " Yeah . " He seemed pleased with himself . " You 're going over to their family . . . ? " " Yeah . " " I 'm glad I 'm leaving now . " " I 'll keep you informed , " he said . " If Dad says nothing about me , you 'll know it went badly . I 'll give you the details when the dust settles . " I specked him running down the tunnel between our rooms when he was five and I was two and a half and adored him . He could leap like a kangaroo and wore rubber pads to bounce hands and feet down the tunnels . Athletic , calm , always-knows-where-to-go Stan . Never said boo to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his turn to aggravate and provoke . We hugged . " Do n't let her push you around . " Stan made a petulant face , wiped it with his hand like a clown , and smiled sunnily . " I 'm proud you made it , Casseia , " he said . He hugged me quickly , shook my hand , gave me a small package , and left . I sat in a corner and opened the wrapper . Inside was a cartridge of all our blood family does and vids . Stan had paid extra for the weight clearance of one hundred grams ; the box was marked with a cargo stamp . I felt even more empty and alone . I faced the crowded lounge with a kind of luxurious dread . The shuttle would depart in two hours . I 'd be aboard the Tuamotu in less than six hours . We would rise from Mars orbit and inject Solar in less than twenty hours .. . I pocketed Stan 's gift , squared my shoulders , and entered the crowd with a big , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel was never comfortable . The shuttle to orbit was a rude introduction to the necessary economies of leaving a planet : shot out of your planetary goldfish bowl on a pillar of flaming hydrogen or methane , in a cylindrical cabin less than ten meters wide , everyone arranged in stacked circles with feet pointing outward , seventy passengers and two shuttle crew , losing Mars 's reassuring gentle grip and dropping endlessly .. . Temp bichemistry helped . Those passengers who had installed permanent bichemistries to adapt to micro-g conditions spent the first hour in orbit asleep while the boat swung carefully to mate with Tuamotu . I had refused such a radical procedure  --  how often would I travel between worlds ? ? and chosen temp . I spent the whole time awake , feeling my body smooth over the deep uncertainty of always falling . Some things I did n't expect . The quick adjustments of temp bichemis-  | try caused a kind of euphoria that was pleasant and disturbing at once . For several minutes I was incredibly randy . That passed , however , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bithras and Pak-Lee had arrived at Atwood after I was seated , and were in the shuttle somewhere below me . Alice Two was in the hold in a special thinker berth . Being away from net links was like sensory deprivation for a thinker ; less than a tenth of Alice Two 's capacity would be engaged while we were in space . The bandwidth of space communication was too narrow to keep her fully linked and employed . She would not sleep , of course , but she would spend much of the journey correlating events in Earth and Martian history drawn from her large data store . Thinkers had been known to create massive and authoritative LitVid works while in machine dream . Some said the best historians were no longer human , but I disagreed . Alice One and Alice Two seemed quite human to me . Alice even called her copy a " daughter . " I 'd never worked closely with thinkers before , and I was charmed . Sitting on my cramped couch in the dark , a projection of Mars 's orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles was doing now . Unlike Charles , I had n't yet found anyone to seriously occupy my free time . The day before launch , I had spoken with Diane , and she had asked if I looked forward to a shipboard romance . " Dust that , " I 'd answered . " I 'll be a busy rabbit . " The trip would take eight Terrestrial months , one way . Each passenger chose from three options : warm sleep with mind embedded in a sophisticated sim environment ( sometimes crudely called cybernation ) , realtime journey , or a pre-scheduled mix of the two . Most Martians chose realtime . Most Terrestrials returning to Earth chose sims and warm sleep . The Mars scene cut suddenly to a view of the Tuamotu in space . Booms furled , passenger cylinders hugged tightly to the hull , our home for the next eight months looked tiny against the stars . Tugs fastened helium-three fuel and water and methane mass tanks to the bow . The drive funnels flexed experimentally at the stern . A small voice provided running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , built in Earth orbit , nano maintained , veteran of five crossings , refitted before her trip to Mars , well-regarded by travel guides on Earth and Mars . She carried a crew of five : three humans , a dedicated thinker , and a slaved thinker backup . I had a touch of tunnel fever at the thought of being shut up for so long . I had studied the ship 's layout a few hours before boarding , learning my way around the passenger cylinder , previewing shipboard routine .  | But I would have to overcome the conviction that there was no way out . Despite spending most of my life in tunnels and enclosed spaces , I always knew there was another tunnel , another warren , and as a last resort , I could suit and pop through a lock and go Up . . . luxuries not available on the Tuamotu . I was less than comfortable with the thought of spending so many months in the company of so few . What if Bithras , Allen , and I did not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time from the primary lock down the length of the hull and debouched us into a small cabin forward of the drive shields . The steward for our cylinder  --  short , taut , sandy-haired and brown-skinned , male , about forty Earth years old , with sharp black eyes  --  greeted us formally and politely , and introduced himself as Acre just Acre . He had the remarkable ability to change his feet into hands , and to bend his long tan legs backwards and forwards , which he demonstrated quickly and with minimal explanation . He escorted us in small groups to the secondary lock . Here , we climbed through an access pipe barely a meter wide into our cylinder , where we drifted in the observation lounge , surrounded by direct-view windows now shuttered and shielded . The lounge had room for all of us . We crowded together waiting for instructions . Bithras headed the last contingent of passengers and conferred briefly with the steward before scowling and searching the crowd . His eyes met mine , the scowl reversed into a radiant smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The steward called my name from the access pipe . I floated forward , fumbling at the grips and bumping a few of my fellows apologetically before anchoring myself . " You 're in charge of our friend here , I under-stand , " he said , pushing forward Alice 's box . Alice 's arbeiter carriage weighed as much as she did and had not been brought along ; we would rent her a carriage on Earth . " Thank you , " I said . " Please hold on to it while we check cabin assignments and get things organized . " " Her , not it , " I said . " Sorry . " He smiled . " We 'll stow her in her niche after orientation . " I took Alice in hand and moved to the side of the lounge . She was endo not exo for the moment  --  her sensors and voice were inactive . " Now that we 're all here , " the steward said , " welcome aboard Tuamotu . We 'll give out some important information and then off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen Pak-Lee floated beside me . " This is my second passage to Earth , " Bithras said in an undertone , " and your first , of course ? " " My first , " I affirmed . Most Earth English accents were familiar to me from LitVid ; the steward , Acre , might have been Australian . His features seemed indigene . Acre delivered the " doctro " crisply and clearly in less than five minutes . He gave us a few safety tips for the next leg of the trip  --  boost and solar orbit injection  --  and had us circle around the lounge to become familiar with weightless aids and procedures . " Tomorrow , " he said , " we 'll discuss immunization levels and all the options available throughout the voyage . Some options are closed  --  all warm-sleep berths are taken for the duration . All temp berths and switchouts are closed , as well . We hope that causes no inconvenience . " " Woe , " murmured Bithras . Acre helped me stow Alice in her niche just forward of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection checks . Bithras attended for a few minutes , applied a strip of ID tape to a seam to protect against unauthorized removal , and left the rest to Acre and me . " Family thinker ? " Acre inquired . " A copy , " I said . " I 'm fond of thinkers , " he said . " Once they 're stowed , they 're no trouble at all . I wish they 'd travel with us more often  --  Sakya gets lonely sometimes , the Captain says . " Sakya was the ship 's dedicated thinker . I reached into the niche , palmed my ID on Alice 's port , and asked , " Everything tight ? " " I 'm comfortable , thank you , " Alice replied , coming exo quickly . " Bithras has sealed me in ? " " Yes . " " I 'm talking with Sakya now . This should be pleasant . Will you join me for a chat once we 're underway ? " " I 'd love to , " I said . I closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave me the key . " We raise them right on Mars , " I said . " Might teach Sakya some manners , " he said . Everything aboard Tuamotu was impressively high nano ; she had been refitted with the latest Earth designs before her last crossing . There were no telltale yeast or iodine smells during nano activity . The ship 's visible surfaces could assume an apparently infinite variety of textures and colors and were capable of displaying or projecting images with molecular resolutions . I felt wrapped in luxury , examining my private cabin  --  two meters by p 125 three by two , private vapor bag and vacuum toilet . If I wanted , I could turn almost the entire cabin into a LitVid screen and be surrounded by any scenery I chose . I pulled out the desk , ported my slate , and selected my scheme . The desk became the color and texture of stone and wood with gold inlay . I ran my fingers along the tactile surface ; the sensations of polished oak , cold marble , and smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather for the boost . I wanted to have a seat , so I quickly unpacked my few things and went aft . Allen Pak-Lee followed and hooked himself to a seat beside me . " Ner-vous ? " he asked . " I do n't think so , " I said . " God , I am . Do n't misunderstand . I have a lot of respect for Bithras . But he 's very demanding . I took a brief from his assistant on the last trip . I le said he spent several months in hell . There was a crisis and Bithras insisted on hogging the waves . " Bithras returned to the lounge and sat beside us with a curt nod . " Damn them , " he said . " Who ? " I inquired . " This ship reeks of progress , " he said . The lounge filled as the gong sounded . The steward , with the aid of a dew slim , graceful octoped arbeiters , served drinks and explained the procedure to the uninitiated . The boost would be comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , we would have a " lazy sense of up and own . " Actually , one-third g was just below Mars standard  --  not quite Rill weight for a red rabbit . The passengers in the lounge who had claimed seats settled in , and ose who drifted found grips and hooks and arranged for a place to p their feet . I looked them over curiously  --  our companions for eight onths . One family would be in our cylinder , a handsome man and man with a daughter whom I judged to be about seventeen Earth ars old  --  native Terries , by their appearance . The daughter , too beauti-I be completely natural , played with a faux mouse . Acre looked at the ceremonial wristwatch on his left arm , raised his nd , and we counted backwards . . . At five , the ship vibrated like a struck bell . At four , the ceiling proted a full-width view aft . Everybody looked up , jaws gaping . The drive nnels flexed . A methane-oxygen kicker motor would take us out of Martian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limb of sun-  | rise Mars : warmup and test . Then the kicker fired full thrust , throwing a long orange cone that quickly turned translucent blue . Gently , we acquired weight . The weight grew until it almost felt as if we were on Mars again . The unseated passengers laughed and stood on the floor , and a few even did a little jig , slapping hands . We severed our bonds with the world of my birth . In my cabin , just before sleep , I studied diagrams from the ship 's operations manual , things I normally would n't give dust for . . . Charles would , however , and I felt again a perverse obligation to think about him . I attributed these thoughts to simple fright and homesickness . Twelve of the passengers in our cylinder would enter warm sleep after the ship had extended its booms for cruising . That would leave twentythree of us awake for the entire voyage  --  mostly Martians , ten female . thirteen male , six of them " eligible , " though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and married males were fair game for travel liaisons . I was not interested , however . I did not feel any immediate affection for Allen , and Bithras was still a threatening cipher  --  not so much a human being as an unfulfilled potential for difficulty . I had never been exceptionally gregarious , a reaction to my diverse and noisy blood relations , and even now was avoiding a First Night Out mixer in the lounge and dining cabin . . . Chemical reaction motors and ion thrusters , used to direct the craft out of planetary orbit and accelerate to just below cruising speed , leave negligible amounts of debris . However , the plume of fusion-heated reaction mass from the main drive contains radioactive engine-surface ablation . The fusion drive must be fired with due regard for vehicles which may cross these orbits for as long as four days afterward , as required by Triple Navigational Standards . . . The ship would switch on its main drives ten million kilometers out from Mars . Solar wind must be able to clear all fusion debris from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks ( the manual informed me ) . This gives sufficient leeway for most times of the solar cycle , but at periods of minimum solar activity , debris may not be cleared for as p 127 long as forty-five days , and special permission from Triple Navigation Control must be obtained if fusion-driven ships are to be launched in this period . Colorful 3-D diagrams unfolded in the air to supplement the text . Earth-Mars passages launched when the planets are not in their most favorable configurations require more fusion boosts and higher speeds . Elongated , faster ship courses  --  as opposed to " fatter " and slower courses ? take liners within the orbit of Venus , and occasionally within the orbit of Mercury , with greater exposure to solar radiation . Medical nano has advanced to where radiation damage in passengers can be repaired quickly and efficiently , eliminating ill effects from even the closest " sun-grazing " passages .. . What if I was n't cut out for space flight ? I had passed the examinations well enough  --  but there were instances of space-intolerant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't available . Eight months of horror seemed to stretch before me . The cabin closed in , the air tasted stale . I imagined Bithras pawing me . I would clobber him . He would n't be nearly as understanding as he should be , and I would be fired before reaching Earth . I would have no option but to return at the next available opportunity , another ten or even twelve months in space . . . I would go insane and start screaming . The ship 's medical arbeiter would pump me full of drugs and I would enter that horrid state described in pop LitVids , caught between worlds , mind drifting free of my body with nowhere to go , away from the humanized spheres , forced to consort with elder monstrosities . i started to giggle . The elder monstrosities would find me inexpressibly ) ring and reject me . Absolutely nobody and nothing to talk to , career fined , I would end up counseling asteroid miners in how to program cir prosthetutes for more lifelike behavior . The giggles turned to laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise . The laughter was not pleasant  --  it sounded forced and harsh  --  but It was effective . I rolled on my back , fears quelled . Acre and his fellow steward in charge of the opposite cylinder held a party for " Half-Degree Day . " Acre was a master at giving parties ; he never seemed bored , was never at a loss for polite conversation . His only lime alone came when the rest of the passengers were asleep . His sole defense seemed to be a certain blankness that did not encourage long  | conversations . I was pretty sure he was n't an Earth-made android , but the suspicion never passed completely . Passengers gathered in the lounge from both cylinders , still mingling freely , and watched Mars become the size of Earth 's Moon , as seen from Earth . The Terrestrials found the sight entrancing , and there were songs of " Harvest Mars , " though the planet was only one-third full . The Captain broke out a glass bottle of French champagne , one of five , he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our third day out ; her name was Orianna , and her parents were citizens of the United States and Eurocon . Her face fascinated me . Eyes uplifted at the corners , slightly asymmetric , pupils the fiery red-brown color of Arcadia opal , her skin flawless multiracial brown , she seemed perfectly at home in micro-g and floated like a cat . She recommended the best sims available on the ship , and seemed amused when I told her I did n't go in for sims . " Martians are lovely curious , " she said . " You 'll be a big draw on Earth . Terries love Martians . " I was prepared not to like Orianna very much . For the first week , Bithras spent much of his time exercising , working in his cabin , or waiting impatiently to communicate with Mars . He rarely even spoke to us . Allen and I spent some time in each other 's company at first , exercising or studying together , but we did not hit it off personally , and soon drifted to other passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder fore and aft , and despite my reticence , had spoken to almost everybody . Not much chance of shipboard romance ; the men were all older than me , and none seemed interesting ; all , like Bithras , were movers and shakers and much absorbed in things they really could n't talk about . I fantasized being aboard an immigrant ship , with men of diverse background , whose hidden pasts they would suddenly feel the urge to confess . . . Dangerous people , intriguing , passionate . Mounted on the hull was a four-meter telescope , kept collapsed and hidden away for the first few million kilometers , then unfurled for the use of passengers . I had signed up for a few hours . The free hours aboard Tuamotu were wonderful for catching up on subjects I had neglected , including astronomy . The viewing station for our cylinder was in the observation lounge , a small cubicle with room for four . I had hoped to study alone , try my hand at celestial navigation and object finding , tracking a few of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to rediscover at least the most prominent and closest examples . But in the lounge I met Orianna . Point-blank , she asked if she could join me . " I have n't signed up , and it 's full for a week ! " she said plaintively . " I love astronomy . I 'd like to transform and go to the stars . . . " She separated her hands a few centimeters , suggesting the proposed size of humans designed for interstellar migration . " Would you mind ? " I did , but Martian manners kept me polite . I said of course she could join me , and with a smile , she did . She was adept with the controls and ruined my game by tracking all my chosen objects expertly within a few minutes . I expressed my admiration . " It 's nothing , " she said . " My parents gave me seven different enhancements . If I want , I can play nearly all musical instruments with just a few days ' practice  --  not like the best , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a few years , if they make it legal , I could install a mini-thinker . " " Does n't it bother you , having so many talents ? " I asked . Orianna curled into a ball and with one finger flicked herself upside down in relation to me . Her toe caught on a bar and she stopped spinning . " I 'm used to it . Even on Earth , some people think my parents and I have gone too far . I 've asked for things , they 've given them to me . . . I have to really ramp down to make friends . " " Are you ramped down now ? " I asked . " You bet . I do n't show off , ever . Good way to spoil any chance of connecting . You 're a natural , are n't you ? " I nodded . " Some of my friends would envy you . The chance to just be what you are . But it would slow me down too much . Do you ever feel slow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . much , or for long . " All the time , " I said . " Then why not enhance ? I mean , it 's possible , even on Mars . And you 're from Majumdar , the finance BM . . . are n't you ? " The inflection of her last question told me she knew very well I was from Majumdar . " Yes . How long have you been on Mars ? " " Just time for turnaround . Two months . We came on a fast passage , inside Venus . My parents had never been to Mars . My folks thought we should see what Mars and the Moon are really like . Carnay . In the flesh . " " Did you like it ? " " It 's wonderful , " she said . " Such defiance . Beautiful , really . Like the whole planet is just hitting puberty . "  | I had never heard it described that way . Martians tended to think of themselves as old and established , perhaps confusing our own brief past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you visit ? " " We were invited to stay in half a dozen towns and cities . We even went to a handful of extreme stations , new ones settled by immigrant Terries . My father and mother know quite a few Eloi . We did n't get to ? " Again the introspective pause . " Ylla or Jiddah . That 's your home , is n't it ? " " What are you referencing ? " I asked . My home address was n't on the open manifest . " I sucked in the public directories , " Orianna said . " I have n't dumped them yet . " " Why would you want to do that ? Any slate can carry them . " " I do n't use a slate , " she said . " I take it direct . No separation . I love being dipped . " " Dipped ? " She wrapped her arms around herself . " Immersed . It 's like I just go away , and there 's only information and processing , pure and swift . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Education means being . " " Oh . " I closed my mouth . " I think I came on sharp for most Martians . I negged quite a few my own age , even . Martians are fashion locked , are n't they ? " " Some think so . " " You ? " " I 'm pretty conservative , I suppose . " She unfolded long arms and legs and gripped the holds in the booth with uncanny grace . " I do n't like anybody on the ship , for partners , I mean , " she said . " Do you ? " " No , " I said . " Have you had many partners ? " " You mean , lovers ? " She smiled wisely , anciently . " That 's a good word , but not always accurate , is it ? " " A few , " I said , hoping she would take a hint and not pry . " My parents were part of the early partner program . I 've been partnering since I was ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid my shock ; I had heard about early partnering , but it had certainly never taken on Mars . " We think childhood is for children , " I said . " Believe me , " Orianna said , " I have n't been a child since I was five . Does that bother you ? "  | " You first had sex when you were ten ? " This conversation was making me very uncomfortable . " No ! I have n't had physical sex at all . " " Sim ? " I asked meekly . " Sometimes . Partnering . . . oh , I see your confusion . I mean sharing closeness mentally , finding so many kinds of pleasure together . I like whole-life sims . I 've experienced two . . . Very expanding . So I know all about sex , of course . Even sex that 's not physically possible . Sex between four-dimensional human forms . " Suddenly she looked distressed , and she had such a charismatic presence that I immediately wanted to apologize , do anything to make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of people like her . " I 've never shared my mind , " I said . " I 'd love to share with you . " The offer was so disarming I was at a loss for an answer . " You have a truly natural presence , " she continued . " I think you could share beautifully . I 've been watching you since the trip began . . . " She primmed her lips and pulled back to the wall . " If I 'm not too forward . " " No , " I said . She put out her hand and touched my cheek , stroking it once with the hack of her fingers . " Share with me ? " I blushed furiously . " I do n't . . . do sims , " I said . " Just talk , then . For the trip . And when we get to Earth , I can show you a few things you 'd probably miss . . . as a Martian tourist . Meet my friends . We 'd all enjoy you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping , if the offer were more than I could possibly handle , that I could plead an intercultural misunderstanding and escape . " Earth is really something , " Orianna said with a wonderfully languid blink . " I see it a lot more clearly now that I 've been to Mars . " We were close to the ten-million-kilometer mark , three weeks into the voyage . The fusion drives would soon turn on . The hull would not be livable once they became active . After a truly big party , featuring one of the best banquets the voyage would offer , the Captain said his farewells and crossed to the opposite cylinder . Passengers berthed there would no longer be able to visit us ; we all shook hands and they followed the Captain . Most of our cylinder 's occupants went to bed in their cabins to take the change easily . A few hardy souls , myself included , stayed in the lounge . There was an obligatory countdown . I hated feeling like a tourist , but I joined in . Acre was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had returned to weightlessness , but were about to acquire full Earth weight for several hours . The countdown arrived at zero , all eight of us shouted at once , and the ship resounded with a hollow thud . We set our feet onto the lounge floor . Orianna , near her parents , seemed close to ecstasy . I was reminded of Bernini 's St. Theresa speared by a shaft of inspiration . The fusion flare followed us like a gorgeous bridal train . Brilliant blue at the center , tipped with orange from ablated and ionized engine and funnel lining , it pushed us relentlessly to almost three times our accustomed Mars weight , a full g . A few , including Orianna 's mother and father , climbed forward and valiantly exercised in the gym , joking and casting aspersions on the rest of us slackers . I chose a middle course , climbing around the cylinder for an hour . My temp bichemistry treatments made the full g force bearable but not pleasant . I had read in travel prep that a week on Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressive weight . Orianna accompanied me ; she had temp also , and was working to regain Earth strength . As we climbed through the cylinder , from the observation deck to the forward boom control walkway , Orianna told me about Earth fashions in clothes . " I 've been out of it for two years , of course , " she said . " But I like to think I 'm still tuned . And I keep up with the vids . " " So what are they wearing ? " I asked . " Formal and frilly . Greens and lace . Masks are out this year , except for floaters  --  projected masks with personal icons . Everybody 's off pattern projection , though . I liked pattern projection . You could wear almost nothing and still be discreet . " " I can redo my wardrobe . I 've brought enough raw cloth . " Orianna made a face . " This year , expect fixed outfits , not nano-shape . Old fabric is best . Tattered is wonderful . We 'll dig through the recycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fake is beyond deviance . " " Do I have to be in fashion ? " " Abso not ! It 's drive to ignore . I switch from loner to slave every few months when I 'm at home . " " Terries will expect a red rabbit to be trop retro , no ? " Orianna smiled in friendly pity . " With that speech , you 're fulfilled already . Just listen to me , and you 'll slim the current . " Breathless , standing on the walkway around the bow 's boom connector , we rested for a moment . " So correct me , " I said , gasping . " You still say trop shink ' on Mars . That 's abso neg , mid twenty-one .  | Sounds like Chaucer to Terries .

" " Still safe , " she said . The fusion drives shut off and weightlessness returned . The time had come to separate the cylinders from the hull and begin rotation . Tuamotu carefully spun her long booms between central hull and outboard cylinders . The booms were attached to a rotor on the hull , and the cylinders used their own small methane kickers to set up spin . When extended , the cylinders pointed perpendicular to the hull ; just as when we had experienced ship acceleration , to move from deck to deck one had to climb up or down , or take the elevator . The centrifugal force created about one-fourth g in the observation lounge , the outboard or " lowest " deck . When the cylinders had cycled to maximum , the warm sleepers retired to their cubicles . A little party was given for them . In our cylinder , we were now down to twenty-three active passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled her cabin with projected picts , each leading to a sim or LitVid put on hold ; twenty or more , hanging in the air like tiny sculptures , some pulsing , some singing faintly . She laughed . " Silly , is n't it ? " she said . " I 'll turn them off . . . " She waved and the icons disappeared , allowing me to see the rest of her cabin . It was tidy but busy . A sweater lay in one corner , or at least half of a sweater . Little sticks poked out of it , and a ball of what must have been thread  --  yarn , I remembered  --  lay beside it . " Knitting ? " I asked . " Yeah . Sometimes I do n't know where I am or what I 'm doing , and knitting or crocheting brings me back . It 's the drive in Paris , where my father lives . " " Your mother lives with your father ? " " Sometimes . They bond loose . I live with my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live with my mother . She 's a merchandising agent for Iskander Resources .

I have a great North Sea sim  --  like to see it ? " " Not right now . Would n't you like to live in just one place ? " I asked . Orianna held out her hands . " Why ? " " To get a feeling of belonging . Knowing where you are . " She smiled brightly . " I know the entire Earth . Not just in rims , either . I 've been all over , with and without my parents . I can fly a shocker from Djibouti to Seattle in four hours . Weather change is great . Really sweeps the sugars . " " Have you ever gone slow ? " I asked . " You mean . . . " She smoothed her hand along the bed cover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digit . " " Sure . I bicycled across France two years ago with some Kenyans . Campfires , night skies , grape harvest in Alsace . You 're really jammed on this , are n't you ? " " If you mean , stuck in a rut , obviously . " " Earth is n't decadent , Casseia . It really is n't . I 'm not a poor little rich girl , any more than you are . " " Maybe I 'm just jealous . " " I 'd call it shy , " Orianna said . " But if you want to ask me about Earth , realtime , oral history and culture , that 's fine with me . We have months left , and I do n't want to spend it all jogging and simming . " My Earth studies and conversations with Alice had left me with the impression of a flawless society , cool and efficient . But what I heard in conversation with Orianna seemed to contradict this . There were great disagreements between Terries ; nations within GEWA and its southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as populations from one country traded places with others  --  a popular activity in the late 70s . Some populations  --  Islam Fatimites , Green Idaho Christians , Mormons , Wahabi Saudis , and others  --  maintained stances that would be conservative even on Mars , clinging stubbornly to their cultural identities in the face of Earth-wide criticism . Paleo-Christians in Green Idaho , practically a nation unto itself within the United States , had declared the rights of women to be less than those of men . Women fought to have their legal powers and rights reduced , despite opposition from all other states . On the reverse , in Fatimite Morocco and Egypt , men sought to glorify the image of women , whom they regarded as Chalices of Mohammed . In Greater Albion , formerly the p 135 United Kingdom , adult transforms who had regressed in apparent age to children were forbidden to hold political office , creating a furor I could hardly begin to untangle . And in Florida , defying regulations , some humans transformed themselves into shapes similar to marine mammals . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea exhibits for tourists . In language , the greatest craze of the 60s and 70s was invented language . Mixing old tongues , inventing new , mixing music and words electronically so that one could not tell where tones left off and phonemes began , creating visual languages that wrapped speakers in projected , complex symbols , all seemed designed to separate and not bring together . Yet enhancements were available that were tuned to the New Lingua Nets or NLN . Installing the NLN enhancements through nano surgery , one could understand virtually any language , natural or invented , and even think in their vernacular . The visual languages seemed especially drive in the 70s . In GEWA alone , seventy visual languages had been created . The most popular was used by more than four and a half billion people . Despite what Alice had said , it did n't sound at all integrated to me . To a Martian , even to a native like Orianna , Earth seemed diverse , bewildering , crazy . But to Alice , Earth was entering the early stages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight , Bithras called me to his cabin . I girded myself for battle , palmed his door port . The door opened and I stepped in at the wave of his hand . He wore long pants and a cotton long-sleeved shirt , again in white , and he muttered to himself for a few minutes , searching for memory cubes , as if I had not yet arrived . " Yes , " he said finally , locating the lost cubes and turning to face me . " I hope your trip has not been too dull . " I shook my head . " I 've spent most of the time researching and exercis-ing , " I said . " And talking to Alice . " " Yes . " " Alice is brilliant , but she has some of the naivete found in all think-ers , " Bithras said . " They can not judge humans harshly enough . I have no such illusions . My dear , the time has come for us to do some work , and it involves your past . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave the faintest nod . " What do you know about Martian scientists and Bell Continuum the-ory ? " ory.  | " I do n't think I know anything about Bell Continuum theory , " I said . " Majumdar BM has been speaking with Cailetet Mars about sponsoring new research . There is a request for so-called Quantum Logic thinkers in the works . Earth is exporting such thinkers , but they are incredibly expensive . . . thirty-nine million dollars , shipped endo and inactive . We must build our own personalities for them , and that might take months , even years . " I still volunteered nothing , though I could feel where he was heading . " You once knew Charles Franklin , promising student from Klein BM , correct ? " " Yes . " " You were lovers ? " I swallowed and thrust my chin forward resentfully . " Briefly , " I said . " He is lawbonded now to a woman from Cailetet . " " Oh . " Bithras studied my reaction . " Mr. Franklin heads a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the Olym-pians . " " I did n't know that , " I said . " Not surprising , since their work is kept close to their bosoms . They report only to the fund administrators , and have published nothing so far . I want you to read this transmission from Earth . It is a few days old , and it was sent to Cailetet from Stanford University . " " How did you get it ? " I asked . Bithras smiled , shook his head , and handed his slate to me . The message was pure text and read : We 've established strong link between time tweak and space tweak . Can derive most special relat . Third tweak discovered may be co-active but purpose unknown . Tweak time , tweak space , third tweak changes automatically . Probably derive general relat. as regards curvature , but third tweak pushes a fourth tweak , weakly and sporadically . . . Derive conservation of destiny ? Fifty tweaks discovered so far . More to come . Can you share your discoveries ? Mutual bennies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Highly unusual , Earth courting Mars . Did Charles Franklin discuss such matters ? " " No , " I said . " Well . . . I think he mentioned Bell Continuum ' and something else . Forbidden channels . ' Whatever they are . He did n't say much . I was n't interested . " " Pity , " Bithras said . " You had a prime opportunity , both to romance p 137 Mr. Franklin and to learn about something very important . He might have told you ? " " If he had , I would n't have understood . " " The Bell Continuum , ' my researchers tell me , is the key to a radical theory of physics that shows some promise . The Olympians refer to universes as destinies . ' " I shook my head , still all uncomprehending . " We are interested , Casseia , because Cailetet Mars is being pressured to pull out from Tharsis funding . All funding . " " Cailetet is Lunar , " I said . " Yes , but dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent . And at the same time , Mr. Franklin has been approached by Stanford University to join their program and come to Earth to continue his research . They promise access to Earth 's most advanced thinkers , including Quantum Logic thinkers , and a very high personal salary as well . They will also help relieve Klein 's money problems . Which , of course , are due largely to interference from GEWA . " " Did he accept ? " " He reported the offer to Klein , as is only polite within a family , and Klein informed the Council , which is also only polite . The Council passed the information to major funders of Tharsis research . No , he did not accept . Mr. Franklin is an admirable young man . Alice concludes that Earth is heavily engaged in research in the Bell Continuum and something called descriptor theory . ' There have been other hints to that effect . " " It 's important ? " Bithras smiled . " Earth wo n't get Charles Franklin , or any of the Olympians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their purposes . " " Oh , " I said . Charles had done the right thing , and he had gotten what he wanted by doing it . Admirable . " I am sorry your affair went no further , " Bithras said . " Why did you break with him ? " The transition into personal prying was accomplished with so little change in tone that I was almost lulled into answering . Instead , I smiled and turned one hand over , raised my eyebrows , and shrugged : C'est la vie . " Have you had much experience with brilliant men ? " " No , " I said . " Much experience with men at all ? " I continued smiling and said nothing . Bithras watched me intently . " I  | have observed that young women acquire most of their knowledge of men in the first five years of their romantic lives . It is a crucial time . I would guess that you are within that five-year period . To neglect your education would be a pity . A spaceship offers such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember anything more about Charles Franklin , please tell me . I am reluctantly forced to catch up on physics , and I am not so skilled at mathematics . I hope Alice is a good tutor . " He thanked me and opened the cabin door . In the hallway , I passed Acre on some errand , murmured hello , and went to the exercise room . There , accompanied by four sweating men , all about Bithras 's age , I worked off my anger and dismay for about an hour . Charles had married . He had the anchor he wanted . He was well on his way to being significant , to Earth and Mars , if not to me . Good for him . Orianna burned like an intense flame blown by swift winds . I never could predict the direction of those winds , what her moods would be precisely ? but I never knew her to be morose , or discouraged , or even overtly judgmental . When she fixed her attention on me  --  listening to me or just watching me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutinized by a human ... Orianna was not effectively more wise than I was , but her instant access to information , her blithe show of skills not learned or earned but bought , were marvelous . What she lacked was what I lacked  --  what all Earth 's glory could not give her or me : experience that sat deep in the mind and in the flesh . Her enhancements and all her advanced education could not give her passionate conviction or a true sense of direction . Talking , letting the telescope share our rooms with projected images , sharing LitVids , playing games in the lounge , watching the stars pass from the observation deck . . . Orianna showed me a mirror to my own immediate past  --  she taught me a lot about Earth , and perhaps even more about myself . Through her , I saw more clearly how far I had to go . But I was still reluctant to join Orianna in a sim . She persisted in her efforts to convince . " I smuggled some real outer sims past Earth douane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to me on Jill 's Day , December 30 . We were in the fifth month of our crossing and had just emerged from the most strenuous regimen of exercises yet  --  three hours in the gym with magnet suits , running in place in fields that simulated full Earth gravity . " You wo n't tell ? "  | " Is that illegal ? " " Well , no , but the companies that make them are pretty protective . They could cut me off a customer list if they found out . They do n't want dupes made off Earth . " " Sims are n't very popular off Earth , " I said . Orianna shrugged that off . " There 's one I think you 'll really like . It 's gradual . Puts you in touch with all the cultural differences between you and me . Set on present-day Earth , but it 's not an education piece . It 's fantasy and very romantic . Since you have access to Alice ... Alice would be perfect for screening our sims . Much better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm not sure she 'd agree . " " I 've never met a thinker that was n't eager to build up more data on human nature . Besides , it 's Jill 's Day . Time to celebrate . Alice needs relaxation , too . " Jill , the first thinker on Earth to achieve self-awareness  --  on December 30 , 2047 ? had served as template for the next generation of thinkers , and so in a very real way was a direct ancestor of Alice . Jill was still active on Earth . Alice wanted to visit her broadband on the nets when we got to Earth , if we had time . We took turns in my room with the vapor bag and toweled off , then sat . " You are fined on sims , " I said . " What about real life ? " Orianna said , " When I 'm eighteen , real life will mean something . When I 'm on my own , and my parents are n't responsible for my actions , I can take risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutlet . " " Cutlet ? " " Slice off the parental loin . Sims are exercise for the rest of my life . " " Even fantasy ? " She smiled . " Well . . . not to stretch a point . They 're fun . " I gently declined the offer , but hinted there might be time later . The routine of each day in space became hypnotic . After four or five hours ' sleep  --  growing less each month  --  I would wake up to pleasant music and a projection of the ship 's schedule for the day , along with a menu from which I could choose my meals and activities . I exercised , ate breakfast , spent a few hours with Orianna or Alice , or sat in the main lounge , chatting with other passengers . Space chat was congenial , seldom stimulating or controversial . I exercised again before lunch , more strenuously , and joined Orianna and her parents to eat . Allen and I met in with Bithras every two or three days . His Earth agenda was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | He gave us LitVids and documents to study , some proprietary to Majumdar . I was careful not to reveal anything I learned from these sessions in conversation with Orianna , or anybody else . At dinner , I joined Allen and Bithras and several of Bithras 's acquaintances from Earth . After dinner , I spent time in my cabin with LitVidshungry for an outside existence  --  and then exercised lightly and had a snack with Orianna or Allen . It did n't take me long to pick holes in some of the statements made by Terries aboard ship , general assumptions about Earth 's future , GEWA 's or GSHA 's plans ; I was close to a center now , and what I was learning both disturbed and impressed me . One conversation sticks in my memory , because it was so atypically blunt . It took place at the end of the fifth month . After an hour poring over Earth economics and its relation to the Triple  --  a relation of very large dog wagging a tiny but growing tail  --  I dropped down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excellent nano food  --  better than anything available on Mars  --  were ferried to me by the dining room arbeiter from the brightly lit mouth of the dispenser . Orianna was in her cabin , lost in a sim ; we had a date for later in the day . I sat beside Allen at the outside of a curved table . Across from us sat Orianna 's parents . Renna Iskandera , her mother , a tall , stately Ethiopian woman , wore a loose jumpsuit in brilliant orange , dark purple , and brown block prints . Her husband , Paul Frontiere , French by birth and a citizen of Eurocon , dressed in trim gray and forest-green spacewear , loose at waist and joints , slimming around wrist and ankles . Allen was already talking with Renna and Paul . I sat beside him , listening attentively . " I think we 're a little daunted by Earth and Earth customs , " Allen said . " So many people , so many cultures and fashions . . . The more I learn , the more confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homeworld in school ? " asked Renna . " To prepare , I mean , for such trips as this . " " We study , " Allen said , " but Martians are pretty self-absorbed . " He glanced at me , the skin around his eyes crinkling in private humor . " On Earth , we 're proud of our acceptance of change , and of our unity within diversity , " Paul said . " Martians seem proud of common heritage . " I decided to ramp up the provocation , in the interests of understanding Terries , of course , and not because of the slight sting of the veiled accusation of being provincial . " We 've all been taught that Earth is politically more calm and more stable than it 's ever been ? " p 141 " That is true , " Paul said , nodding . " But there 's so much argument ! So much disagreement ! " Renna laughed , a high , wonderful melody of mirth . She was twice my age , yet appeared much younger , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revel in it , " she said . " We take pride in shouting at each other . " " You mean , it 's all a front ? " Allen asked . " No , we genuinely disagree about many things , " Renna said . " But we do not kill each other when we disagree . You are of course taught about the twentieth century ? " " Yes , " I said . " Of course . " " The bloodiest in human history . A nightmare  --  one long war from almost the beginning to almost the end , a hothouse for every imaginable tyranny . Even at its conclusion , passions between peoples of different heritage , different religions , even simple geographic differences , led to murder and reprisal on a hideous scale . But it was the century in which more people than ever broke from traditional power structures , expressed skepticism , found disillusionment and despair  --  and grew . " I frowned . " Grew out of despair ? " " Grew out of necessity . No turning back to old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer profit in destruction . The great god Mammon became a god of peace . And that is when we looked outward  --  and made the beginnings of the settled Moon and Mars and the outer small worlds . People were able to see more clearly . " " But you 're still arguing , " I said , and bit my lip gently , hoping to give the impression that my naivete now lay naked on the table before them . Bithras was teaching me the art of lapwing ? faking confusion or weakness for advantage . " I hope not to speak for everyone on Earth , of course ! " Paul said , laughing . " To argue is not to hate , not for healthy minds . Our opponents are prized . They goad us to greater accomplishment . If we are defeated , we know that there are other wars to be fought , wars without blood , wars of intellect and of many possible outcomes , not just defeat or victory . " " And if you argue with Mars ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we disagree ? " " We are fearful opponents , " Paul admitted . Renna seemed less happy with that answer . " What is good for all , is good for Earth , " she said . She touched my hand . " On Earth , there is so much variety , so much possibility for growth and change , so much , as you say , argument , but if you track the politics ,  | the responses of peoples wherever they may live , there are astonishing agreements on major goals . " Goals . The word rang like a bell . Alice , you are so right . " Such as ? " " Well , " Renna said , " we can not afford to lack discipline . The universe is not so friendly . Weaknesses and weak links ? " " Such as Mars , " I said . Renna 's eyes narrowed . Perhaps I was laying it on too thick . " We must act together for the common goals of all the human worlds . " " What are we to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the next push  --  to migrate to the stars . There are worlds enough for all who disagree to try great experiments , make great strides . . . But we will not achieve them if we are separate now , and lacking discipline . " " What if our goals do n't coincide ? " I asked . " All things change , " Renna said . " Whose goals should change ? " " That 's what the debate is about . " " And if debate is n't enough ? Debate can grind on forever , " I said . " True , there is n't always the luxury of unlimited time . " " If debate has to be cut off , " I said , " who does the cutting ? " Renna looked at me shrewdly . She was enjoying herself , but I had to ask , despite all their obvious sophistication , despite their time on Mars , did they truly understand how a Martian felt ? " When a society ca n't do the good drive , as Orianna might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means must be tried . " " Force ? " I asked . " Renna dearly loves to debate , " Paul said confidentially to Allen . " This ship has been too quiet , too polite . " " Where Mars and Earth can not agree , there is always room for growth and discussion , " Renna concluded , staring at me in an entirely friendly and expectant way . " Force is an old habit I do not approve of . " She obviously wanted me to counter , but something had cut deep and I did not wish to oblige her . I gave a cool smile , inclined , and tapped my plate to signal the arbeiter I was finished . " We sometimes forget the sensibilities of others , in our enthusiasm , " Paul said warily . " It 's nothing , " Allen said . " We 'll pick up the discussion later . " Bithras had a lot on his mind . His behavior was exemplary . He seemed more a concerned blood uncle than a boss ; sometimes a teacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me to riddle the puzzles of Earth . Never the sacred monster my mother had described . His transition , in the middle of our sixth month , came abruptly enough to catch me completely off guard . Bithras called me to his cabin for consultation . He had taken to wearing tennis togs again , and as I came in , he sat in his white cotton shirt and shorts , legs pushed against the opposite wall , slate on his lap . " A lot of tension on Mars this week , " he said . " I have n't seen anything in the LitVids , " I said casually . " Of course not , " he said with a twitch of his mouth . " I would n't expect it to get that far . Not yet . Two BMs have decided to make their own proposals for unification . " " Who ? " I asked . " Mukhtiar and Pong . " " Not top five . . . " I said . " And not likely to attract any attention . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forced a lot of favors to carry our proposal to Earth . Some people who are nervous are much more nervous now . If I am undercut , if someone decides to mount a strong campaign across Mars before we arrive . . . concessions to Earth , sellouts . . . " He lifted his hand and squinted at me . " Not fun . I worry about Cailetet . They seem to believe they have extra cards in this game . " I shook my head in sympathy . He leaned back a few more centimeters and looked me over . " What have you learned from the Terries ? " " A lot , I think . " " Do you know that Terries have been increasing the average age for first sexual experience for the last thirty years , and that more and more of them never have physical sex at all , up to ten percent now ? " He squinted skeptically , as if mounting a speculation . " I 've heard that , " I said . " Some people marry and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmed by his straight and narrow behavior for so many weeks that even now I suspected nothing . " There have been marriages between thinkers and humans . Marriages physically celibate but mentally promiscuous . People who have children without having sex and without giving birth . Marvels and frights to a red rabbit . " " We have ex utero babies on Mars , " I said quietly , wondering what he was up to . " I prefer the old fashioned way , " he said , fixing his round black eyes  | on me . " There has been damned little of that this voyage . All work . You have not been very romantically adventurous either , I notice . " Signals of caution finally broke through . I did n't answer , just shrugged , hoping my uncomfortable silence would be enough to deflect the course of the conversation . " We will be working together for many months . " " Right , " I said . " Is it possible to be completely comfortable together , working for so long ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll be red rabbits among the Terries . " He nodded emphatically . " Among very strange and high-powered people . It will cause tensions far worse than what I feel now , going over these recent messages . We 're in a war of nerves , Casseia , and we might enjoy  --  mutually  --  a place of retreat . . . from the war . " " I 'd like to read the messages , " I said . " I would not feel comfortable taking solace from a Terrie woman . " " I 'm not sure this is ? " He pushed ahead with a little shake of his head . " What if I work very hard on a temporary relationship , and it can be only that , and discover the woman from Earth wants me to have sex only in sim ? " He stared at me incredulously . Angering by slow degrees , I kept in mind my mother 's admonition : be clever , be witty . I felt neither clever nor witty but I did not yet ramp to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements , early , " Bithras said . He reached up and stroked my arm , quickly moving to grip my shoulder . He let go of my shoulder and ran a finger lightly on the fabric centimeters above my breast . " You are much more . . . to me . " " Within the family ? " " That is not an obstacle . " " Oh , " I said . " An arrangement of convenience . " " Much more than that . We may both focus on our work , having this resolved . " " A stronger relationship . " " Certainly , " Bithras said . Delicately , I pushed back his arm . " What you 're saying is , we should start our family now , right ? " I said cheerily . He drew his head back , dismayed . " Family ? " " We need to make more red rabbits , right ? To offset Earth 's billions ? A policy matter . "  | " Casseia ! " he said . " You deliberately misunderstand ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on procreating so early , but if it serves policy , I suppose I must . " Wit or not , I forged ahead . I put on a stoic face , lifted my hand to my brow , and said , " Bithras , all that can be asked of any red doe , in this life , is to lie back and think of Mars . " He made a face of sharp distaste . " That is not funny , Casseia . I am discussing serious difficulties in our personal lives . " " I 'll have to update my medical nano , " I said . " Bichemistry is different in pregnant women . " " You miss my meaning completely . " He stretched out his arms and again one hand touched my shoulder , moved to my upper breast , while his eyes held me , tried to convince me that this was not what it might seem . " Am I not attractive ? " I lifted my eyebrows and removed his hand again . " You should talk to my father . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter of liaisons and alliances . . . and children . " Bithras slumped his shoulders and waved his hand weakly . " I 'll transfer the docs to your slate . Alice already has them , " he said . Then he shook his head with genuine sadness and perhaps regret . Guiltless , I did not feel at all sorry . I left his cabin with a dizzy sense of lightness . Forewarned was forearmed . The lightness reverted to anger once I was in my own cabin , and I sat on the bed , pounding the fabric so hard I lifted my bottom several centimeters . Then I lay back and counted backwards , eyes closed , teeth clenched . He has no more control than a baby wetting his diapers , said a calm , cold voice in my head , the part of me that still thought clearly when I was upset . " He has no more technique than a tunnel bore , " I said out loud . " He 's inept . " I sat up , rubbed my eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Tuamotu and Mars was too expensive to be indulged in lightly . I sent text letters instead , addressing Father , Mother , and Stan ; but the last letter I sent , in the beginning of our eighth month , before we slowed for Earth orbit , I addressed to Mother alone . Dear Mom , I 've survived this far , and even enjoyed most of the trip , but I 'm afraid the letters I 've been sending have n't been completely open . Being away from Mars , talking with Terries , watching Bithras at work , I 've become more and  | more aware every day how outmatched we Martians are . We are blinded by our traditions and conservatism . We are crippled by our innocence . Poor Bithras ! He bumped me , as you said he would  --  only once so far , thank God ? and he was so crude , so direct and unsophisticated  --  a man of his travels and broadness of mind , of his importance ! A friend once told me that Martians do n't educate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relations , love  --  relying instead on individual discovery , which is hit-or-miss , mostly miss . On Earth , Bithras would get social-grade therapy , spend some time practicing in Sims , clear his mind and improve his skills . Why does our sense of individuality prevent us from correcting our weak-nesses ? I 'm spending a lot of time with a young woman from Earth . She is sharp and witty , she is a thousand years old compared to me yet she 's only seventeen Earth years . On her eighteenth birthday , I 'm going to go into a sim with her and explore wise old Earth through its fantasies . I do n't know exactly what the sim is , but I suspect it wo n't make me comfortable . She will hardly think anything of it , but I 'm terrified . Terrie-fled . You might be shocked , reading this , but do n't think I 'll be any less shocked , doing it . I have always thought myself to be stable and imperturbable , but my inno-cence  --  my ignorance  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sort . I hope that legitimizes it a little in your eyes , but if not . . . As Orianna  --  that 's the young woman 's name  --  as she says , I 'm no longer a cutlet . I sent the letter coded to our family , and before Mother had a chance to reply , on Orianna 's eighteenth birthday , two days away from our transfer from the Tuamotu to a shuttle to Earth , we dived into her smuggled fantasy sim . " Better late than never , " Orianna said as we hooked our slates on a private channel , through the ship 's broadband , and linked with each other and with Alice , who was willing and even eager to conduct . " You have n't told me what it 's about . " " It 's a forty-character novel . " " Text ? " " Calling it a novel means it has a plot , instead of just being landscape . You 're part of a flow . You can move from character to character , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , but you can watch . In other words , part of you will know you 're still you . It 's not a whole-life sim . " " Oh . " " You can pull out any time , and you can jump , as well . " p 147 " You 've done this sim before ? " " No , " Orianna said . " That 's why I did n't want to just slate it . Alice can give us more protection and more detail . If there 's a bug , she can pull us out gently rather than just disconnecting . A discon always gives me a headache . " It sounded worse and worse . I seriously considered backing out , but looking at Orianna , at her bright-eyed eagerness as she arranged the nano plugs , I felt a sudden burst of youthful shame . If she could do it , I could , too . " You 'll go into the staging faster than I will , " she said , handing me my cable . " My cable will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I placed the cable next to my temple . The tip spread to several centimeters and seized my skin , snaking to get in a position to support its own weight . My arm-hair prickled . This was very like the arrangements for major therapy . Something tickled in my temple : the nano links going in through skin , skull , and cortex , pushing their leads into the proper main lines within the brain . " What happens if this is jerked loose ? " I asked , pushing the cable with a fingertip . " Nothing . The links dissolve . Abso safe . Old old tech . " " And if there 's a bug Alice ca n't handle ? " " She can reprogram anything in the sim . You just spend a few seconds with Alice while she figures it out . " That 's right , actually , Alice said within my head . " Wow , " I said , startled . I had done LitVids with Alice , of course , but a direct link was a very different sensation . Ty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . " Is this ? " Is this right ? Very good . Relax . Do you approve of this sort of thing ? My entire existence is rather like a sim , Casseia . I told my mother we 'd do this . I do n't know what she 'll think . I still saw through my eyes . Orianna had put on her cables and closed her eyes . A muscle in her cheek twitched . " Ready , " she said out loud . Sim will begin in three seconds . I closed my eyes . For the first time in my life , I had the sensation of closing my ears , my fingers , my body , as well . A creator credit icon ? three parallel red knife slashes rising from a black ground , representing no artist or corporation I was familiar with  --  then total darkness .  | When I opened my eyes again , I had a new set of memories . In medias res , along with the memories came a new set of concerns , worries , things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hardly felt the shift . I became Budhara , daughter of the Wahabi Arabian Alliance family Sa'ud , heir to old Earth resource fortunes . I knew somewhere that Budhara had never lived  --  this was fiction  --  but it did n't matter . Her world was real  --  more real than my own , with the intensity possible in exaggerated art . My part in her life began fifty years in the past , and moved with undiminished vividness through seven episodes , ending on her deathbed ten years in the future . There was intrigue , double-dealing , betrayal , sex  --  though very discreet and not very informative  --  and there was a great deal of detail about the life of latter-day Wahabis in a world full of doubters . Budhara was not a doubter , but neither did she conform . Her life was not easy . It did not feel easy , and the intensity of her misery at times was mitigated only by my awareness that it would have an end . Her death was startling in its violence  --  she was strangled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no more revelatory than the sex . My body knew it was not dead , just as it knew it was not really having sex . After , my mind floated in endspace , gray and potent , and I felt Orianna there . She said , " Anybody you saw , you can become . Up to four per session , with a thinker driving . " " How long have we been in sim ? " I asked . " An hour . " It had seemed much longer . I could not really guess how long . But I thought we had not met in the sim , and all I could think to say , in the grayness , was , " I thought we were sharing . " " We did . I was your last husband . " " Oh . " The flush began . She had switched sexes  --  she had known me . I found that intensely unsettling . It called so many of my basics into ques-tion . " We can switch to another location , as well . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a minor character . " " I 'd like to be her parrot , " I joked . " That 's outer , " Orianna said , meaning beyond the sim . " Then I 'd like to go Up , " I said , not using the correct term , but it seemed right . " Surface coming , " Orianna said , guiding me out of the gray . We opened our eyes to the cabin . Being tens of millions of kilometers between worlds seemed boring compared to Budhara 's life . p 149 I whistled softly and rubbed my hands together to assure me this was reality . " I 'm not sure I ever want to do that again , " I said . " Yeah . It 's something sacred the first time , is n't it ? You want to go hack so bad . Real seems fake . It gets easier to pull out later , more perspective , otherwise these would have been negged by law years ago . I do n't do lawneg sims . " " Lawn-egg ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . " I still was n't thinking clearly . " I did n't learn much about Earth . " " The Sa'ud dynasty is pretty withdrawn , is n't it ? Down fortune fanatics , nobody needs their last drops of oil , really top for sim fiction . Budhara 's my favorite , though . I 've been through two dozen episodes with her . She 's strong , but she knows how to bend . I really enjoy the part where she petitions the Majlis to let her absorb her brothers ' fortunes .. after their death in Basra . " " Admirable , " I said . " You do n't look happy ? " " I 'm just stunned , Orianna . " " Wrong choice ? " " No , " I said , though it had been an obtuse choice , to say the least . Orianna , despite her sophistication , was still very young , and I had to be reminded of this now and again . " But I was hoping to learn more about mainstream Earth , not the fringes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have some straightforward stories , even travelogs , but you can get those on Mars . .. " " Maybe , " I said . But I had no intention of trying another . On Earth , billions of people devoured sims every day , and yet I could not rise clear-headed from a cheap romance . Allen and I stood in Bithras 's cabin . " I hate this time , " Bithras told us , staring at himself in mirror projection . " In a few days it wo n't be exercise . It will be a damned ball and chain . And I do n't mean just the Weight , though that will be bad enough . They expect so much out of us . They watch us . I am always afraid some new technology will let them ek into my head while I sleep . I will not feel comfortable until we are n our way home again . " " You do n't like Earth , " Allen said . Bithras glared at him . " I loathe it , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so filled with machinery . Machinery for the heart , for the lungs , nano for this , refit for that ? " " Does n't sound so different from Mars , " I said .  | Bithras ignored me . His basic conservatism was surfacing , and he had to let it out ; better this way , I thought , than that he should bump me again . " They never let a thing alone . Not life , not health , not a thought . They worry it , view it from so many perspectives . . . I swear , not one of the people we talk to is an individual . Each is a crowd , with the judgment of the crowd , ruled by a benevolent dictator called the self , unsure it is really in charge , so cautious , so very bright . " " We have people like that on Mars , " Allen said . " I do n't have to negotiate with them , " Bithras said . " You 've chosen your immunizations ? " Allen made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Well , " Allen said , " I was considering letting in the virus that gives me language and persuasion ... " Bithras stared at us , aghast . " Persuasion ? " " The gift of gab , " Allen said . " You are fooling with me , " Bithras said , pushing back the mirror . " I will look awful . But that matters little , considering they will look so good , even at my best I would look awful . They expect it of Martians . Do you know what they call us , when they are not so polite ? " " What ? " I asked . I had heard several names from Orianna : claytoes , tunnel mice , Tharks . " Colonists , " Bithras said , accent on the middle syllable . Allen did n't smile . It was one word never heard on Mars even in its correct pronunciation . Settlers , settlements ; never colonies , colonists . " A colony , they say , " Bithras continued , " is where you keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Bithras said . " You have listened to Alice , you have listened to the people on this ship . Now listen to the voice of true experience . Earth is very together , Earth is very sane , but that does not mean Earth is nice , or that they like us , or even respect us . " I thought he might be exaggerating . I still had that much idealism and naivete . Orianna , after all , was a friend ; and she was not much like her parents . She gave me some hope . The cylinders were pulled in and stowed along the hull . The spinning universe became stable . Much of our acquired velocity spilled quickly at two million kilometers from Earth ; we lay abed in that time under the persistent press of two g 's deceleration.  | This far from Earth , home planet and moon were clearly visible in one sweep of the eye , and as the days passed , they became lovely indeed . The Moon hung clean silver beside the Earth 's lapis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Solar System than Earth . I might have been looking down on the planet billions of years ago . Even the faint sparks of tethered platforms around the equator , sucking electric power from the Mother 's magnetic field , could not remove my sense of awe ; here was where it all began . For a moment  --  not very long , but long enough  --  I shared the Terracentric view . Mars was tiny and insignificant in history . We shipped little to Earth , contributed little , purchased little ; we were more a political than a geographic power , and damned small at that : a persistent itch to the mighty Mother , who had long since drawn a prodigal daughter Moon back to her bosom . Orianna and I spent as much time staring at the Earth and Moon as we could spare from going through customs interviews . I finished filling out my immunization requests , to block the friendly educations of tailored microbes that floated in Earth 's air . I was excited . Allen was excited . Bithras was dour and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main low-orbit space station , Peace III , and made our way on a liner through thick air and a beautiful sunset , downward to the Earth . Even now , at a distance of sixty years and ten thousand light-years , my heart beats faster and my eyes flow with tears at the memory of my first day on Earth . I remember in a series of vivid still frames the confusion of the customs area on Peace III , passengers from two crossings floating in queues outlined by tiny red lights , Orianna and I bidding our quick farewells , exchanging personal reference numbers , mine newly assigned for Earth and hers upgraded to an adult status , unrestricted ; promising to call as soon as we were settled , however long that might take ; transferring Alice iivo by hand from the niche on Tuamotu ; promising the customs officers she contained no ware in violation of the World Net Act of 2079 , politely refusing under diplomatic privilege the thinker control authority 's offer to sweep her for such instances we might not be aware of ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eiarthgate corridor filled with artwork created by the homeworld 's children ; entering the hatch of the transfer shuttle ; taking our seats with sixty other passengers ; staring for ten minutes at the close-up direct view of Earth ; pushing free of the platform , descending , feeling the window be-  | side my seat become hot to the touch  --  the thick ocean of air buffeting us with enough violence to make me grab my seat arms , red rabbit coming home , heart pounding , armpits damp with expectation and a peculiar anxiety : will I be worthy ? Can Earth love me , someone not born in Her house ? The sunset glorious red and orange , an arc like a necklace wrapped around the beautiful blue and white shoulders of Earth , seen through flashes of fierce red ionization as we bounced and slowed and made our descent into a broad artificial lake near Arlington in the old state of Virginia . Steam billowed thick and white as we rolled gently on our backs , just as the first astronauts had rolled waiting for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rippling blue water ... Water ! So much water ! The tugs grabbed our transfer shuttle in gentle pincers and pushed us toward shore terminals . Other shuttles came in beside us , some from the Moon , some from other orbital platforms , casting great clouds of spray and steam with their torch-gentled impacts in the huge basin . Allen held my hand and I clutched his , made dear siblings by wonder and no small fear . Across the aisle from us , seated beside a padded and restrained Alice , Bithras stared grimly ahead , lost in thought . Now our work really began . We were not just Martians , not mere red rabbits on an improbable playtrip . We were symbols of Mars . We would be famous for a time , wrapped in the enthusiasm of Earth 's citizens for Martian visitors . We would be hardy settlers returning to civilization , bringing a message for the United States Congress ; we would smile and keep our mouths closed in the face of ten thousand LitVid questions . We would make gracious responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ? Ridiculous but not so very ridiculous ; Mars was truly my home , and I missed him already in this wonderful strangeness , but .. . I knew Earth , too . Leaving the shuttle , we installed Alice on her rented carriage , and she tracked beside us . Almost all of us chose to walk between the oaks and maples , across meadows of hardy bluegrass , all first-time Martians breathing fresh open air . We wandered through Ingram Park , named after the first human to set foot on Mars , Dorothy Ingram . Dorothy , 1 know how you felt . I tasted the air , moist from a recent shower , and saw clouds rolling from the south rich with generous rain , and above them the blue of kitten 's eyes , and no limits , no walls , no domes or glass . I know you . My blood knows you .  | Allen and I did a little waltz on the grass around Alice 's carriage . Bithras smiled tolerantly , remembering his own first time . Our antics confirmed Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm not dreaming ? " Allen asked , and I laughed and hugged him and we danced some more on the grass . Bichemistry served as well . We stood upright under more than two and a half times our accustomed weight , we moved quickly on feet that did not strain or ache  --  not for a while , at any rate  --  and our heads remained clear . " Look at the sky ! " I crowed . Bithras stepped between us . " The eyes of Earth , " he said . We sobered a little , but I hardly cared about LitVid cameras recording the arriving passengers . Let Earth hear my joy . My body knew where I was . It had been here before I was born . My genes had made me for this place , my blood carried sea , my bones carried dirt , from Earth , from Earth , my eyes had been made for the bright yellow daylight of Earth 's days and the blue of the day sky and the nights beneath the air-swimming light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbeiter and Bithras answered for us , diplomatically , smiling broadly , we are glad to be back , we expect the most enjoyable talks with the governments of Earth , our partners in the development of Sol 's backyard . He was good and I admired him . All was forgiven , almost forgotten . Beyond the reporters , in a private reception area , we met our guide , a beautiful , husky-voiced woman named Joanna Bancroft who was everything I was not , and yet I liked her . I could not believe I would ever dislike anyone who lived on this blessed world . From the port we took an autocar sent by the House of Representatives . Bancroft accompanied us , asking our needs , giving our slates the updated schedules , providing Alice with a complimentary access to the Library of Congress . The car attached to a slaveway among ten thousand ther linked cars , millipede trains , transport trucks . I listened attentively hough , but rain fell on the windows and trees glistened dark green beneath the somber gray . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows . " Of course , " Joanna said , smiling with lovely red lips and firm plump cheeks . The autocar slid my window down . I leaned my head into the breeze , took several plashes on face and s , stuck out my tongue and tasted the rain .  | Joanna laughed . " Martians are wonderful , " she said . " You make us appreciate what we who live here take for granted . " What we who live here . The words cooled me . I glanced at Bithras and he lifted his eyebrows , one corner of his lips . I understood his unspoken message . We did not own the Earth . We were guests , present by the complicated sufferance of great political entities , the true owners and managers of the Mother . We were not home . We would never be home again , at any price , across any distance . Joanna took us to the Capital Tower Comb , a sprawling green and white complex of twenty thousand homes and hotels and businesses designed to serve people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , space visitors as well . The comb covered two square kilometers on the site where the dreaded Pentagon had once stood , center of the formidable defenses of the old United States of America . We had arranged for accommodation in the Presidential Suite of the Grand Hotel of the Potomac , low on the north wall of the Capital Tower , overlooking the river . Joanna departed after making sure we were comfortable . Allen and I stood in the middle of the suite , unsure what to do next . Bithras paced and scowled . The suite still showed off its capabilities ; rooms and beds and furniture squirmed through a parade of designs and decors , LitVids darted in front of our eyes  --  which would we choose , which special capital ed and entertainment presentations would we reserve ? ? and arbeiters presented themselves in two ranks of three , liveried in the high fashion found only on Earth  --  green velvet and black silk suits , tiny red hats , totally unlike arbeiters on Mars , which wore only their plastic and ceramic and metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , Allen and I doing most of the choosing . Bithras fell into a chair that had finally settled on twentieth-century Swedish . " These people , " he muttered . " If they and their damned rooms would only stand still . " " No hope , " Allen said . He stared out the direct-view window overlooking the river . Beyond , the capital of the United States of the Western Hemisphere could be seen between combs scattered along the Virginia banks of the Potomac . Nothing in Washington DC proper was allowed to stand higher than the Capitol dome  --  that had been a law for centuries . I longed to walk through the Mall , the parks and ancient neighborhoods ,  | under the trees I saw spreading their canopies like billowing green car-pets . " Still raining , " I said in awe . " Sprinkling ' is the term , I believe , " Allen said . " We have to brush up on our weather . " " Weather , ' " I said profoundly , and Allen and I laughed . Bithras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven days before we testify to Congress . We have three days before our meetings with subcommittees and Senate and House members begin . That means two days of preparation and meetings with BM partners , and one day to see the sights . I am too anxious and upset to work today . Alice and I will stay here . You may do what you like . " Allen and I glanced at each other . " We 'll walk , " I said . " Right , " Allen said . Bithras shook his head as if in pity . " Earth wears on me quickly , " he said . The skies had cleared by the time we cabbed into Washington DC . Allen and I had been rather aloof during our crossing , but now we behaved like brother and sister , sharing the wind , the clean crisp air , the sun on our faces : and then , glory of glory , the cherry trees in full blossom . The trees blossomed once every month , we were told , even in winter ; tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " Allen said . " They used to blossom only in the spring . " " I know , " I said peevishly . " I do n't care . " " Trees blossom on Mars , " he said chidingly . " Why should we marvel at these ? " " Because there is no tree on all of Mars that sits under an open sky and raises its branches to the sun , " I said . The sun warmed our bare arms and faces , the wind blew gentle and cool , and the temperature varied from moment to moment ; I could not shake the feeling , damn all politics , all vagaries of birth , that I loved Earth , and Earth loved me . The day was beautiful . I felt beautiful . Allen and I flirted , but not seriously . We drank coffee in a sidewalk cafe , ate an early lunch , walked to the Washington Monument and climbed the long stairs ( I ignored shooting pains in my legs ) , descended , walked more . Strolling the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transform joggers whizzing past like greyhounds . We studied projected history lessons and climbed the steps of the Lin-  | coin Memorial , then stood before the giant statue of Abraham Lincoln . I studied his sad , weary face and gnarled hands , and unexpectedly I felt my eyes moisten , reading the words which flanked him , inspired by the civil war over which he presided and which ultimately killed him . People eat their leaders , I thought . The king must die . Allen had a different perspective . " He was forcing allegiance on the American South , " he said . " He 's politically more Terrie than I care for . " " Mars does n't keep slaves , " I reminded him . " Do n't mind me , " he said . " I 've always rooted for the underdogs . " We then retreated along the reflecting pool and watched the sun go down . " What would Lincoln think of red rabbits ? " Allen asked . " What would Lincoln think of the union now ? " I countered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely overdoing it  --  I was giddy with the weather , the architecture all out in the open , the history . We returned to the comb to have dinner with Bithras in the hotel 's main restaurant . The food was even better than it had been aboard Tuamotu . Much of it was fresh , not nano , and I searched for , and thought I found , the difference in flavor . " It tastes like dirt , I think , " I told Bithras and Allen over the white linen tablecloth and silver candlesticks . " Musty , " Allen agreed . " Not too long since it was alive . " Bithras coughed . " Enough , " he said . Allen and I smiled at each other conspiratorially . " We should n't act provincial , " Allen said . " I 'll act the way I feel , " Bithras said , but he was not angry ; simply stating a fact . " The wine is good , though . " He lifted his glass . " To red rabbits out of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the suite , outside the lift , Bithras looped his arm through mine and pressed me close . Allen saw this and quickly did the same with my other arm . I felt for a moment as if I were being pressed between two overanxious dogs at stud ; then I saw what Allen was up to . Bithras drew his lips into a firm line and let go of my arm . Allen let go immediately after and I gave him a grateful glance . Bithras behaved as if nothing had happened . And , indeed , nothing had happened . The evening had been too pleasant to believe otherwise . " I 've been here for twenty-seven years , " Miriam Jaffrey told us as she invited us into her apartment . " My husband went Eloi ten years ago , and I think , though I do not know for sure , that he is on Mars . . . So here I  | am , a Martian on Earth , and he 's a Terrie up there . " Bithras and Allen took seats at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked across the sprawl of old Virginia combs and even older skyscrapers . We were on the south side of the Capital Tower Comb , opposite from our hotel . " I 'm always snooping out red rabbits , " she said , sitting beside Bithras . They appeared to be about the same age . " It 's lovely to hear what 's changed and what 's the same . Not that I plan on going back . . . I 'm too used to Earth now . I 'm a Terrie , I 'm afraid . " " We 're enjoying ourselves immensely , " Allen said . Miriam beamed . Her long black hair hung over square thin shoulders revealed by a flowing green cotton dress . " I 'm most pleased you could take time out from your busy schedule . " " Our pleasure , " Bithras said . He squirmed his butt into the couch , fighting the self-adjusting cushions . " Now , are we secure ? " " Very , " Miriam said , drawing herself up and suddenly quite serious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen : Miriam is not just a social gadfly , she is the best-informed Martian on Earth about things Washingtonian . " Miriam batted her eyelashes modestly . " She follows the tradition of a long line of hostesses in this capital , who meet and greet , and know all , and she has been invaluable to Majumdar BM in the past . " " Thank you , Bithras , " she said . Bithras produced his slate from a shirt pouch and placed it before her . " We brought a copy of Alice with us . She 's resting in our hotel room now . " " She 's proof against the latest ? " Miriam asked . " We think she is . We refused an opportunity to let customs sweep her . " " Good . She 's Terrie-made , of course , so she 's always a little suspect . " " I trust Alice . She was examined by our finest and found true to her design . " " All right , " said Miriam , but in a tone that betrayed she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all thinkers are a little too sweet and innocent to understand Earth , at least those thinkers allowed to be ex-ported  --  to emigrate . " " Yes , that is so , " Bithras agreed . " She will only advise , however , not rule . " I listened to all this in a state of shock . " You 're a spy ? " I asked inno-cently.  | " Stars , no ! " Miriam laughed and slapped her thigh . She struck a pose , hand on knee , shoulder thrown back , tossing her hair . " Though I could be , do n't you think ? " " We 'll meet later today with representatives from Cailetet and Sand-oval , " Bithras said . " Cailetet 's been very skittish lately , " Miriam said . " Buying up notes and extensions from other BMs , minimizing their exposure in the open Triple Market . " " I do n't expect to get any answers from them , " Bithras said , " but I show the flag , so to speak . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that would be useful . " Though I warn you , I 've never seen Cailetet so spooked . " " I 'd like to know more about these members of the space affairs com-mittee . " Bithras handed her the slate . Names danced before her eyes , along with political icons and identifiers for family and social groups . Miriam scrolled the list thoughtfully . " Good people . Sharp , above the bang . " I surreptitiously looked up " above the bang " on my slate . It read : 1 : CALM , UNFLAPPABLE ; 2 : UNIMPRESSED BY HIGH OFFICE . " They 're dedicated and have n't missed a trick since I 've been here , " Miriam said . " Elected officials on Earth are a breed apart , as Bithras is doubtless aware . " " Yes , we have been dealing with a few of our own . District governors . . . " " The difference is that Earth 's elected officials are therapied , " Miriam said . " All except for John Mendoza , here . Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put up a warm reception for Dauble , but Mendoza 's party co-hosted a reception for her with Deseret Space . Deseret Space gave her shelter for a few weeks . Debriefed her about Mars , I imagine . " " At least they have no designs on Mars , " Bithras said . " No , but Mendoza will ask you why you are n't willing to allocate more Martian-controlled Belt resource shares to Earth , and why you refuse to join the Sol Resource Management group . Deseret Space has formed some bridges with Green Idaho . Green Idaho is finally casting its eyes on space-related business . They 're both firming up state ties with GEWA , circumventing the U.S. " Bithras annotated the transcript of Miriam 's remarks , then looked up and said , " We need to know about Cuba , Hispaniola , New Mexico , and California . " " All on your list , " Miriam said , brow creased , tapping the slate with a p 159 long fingernail . I noticed a vid playing on the fingernail and wondered what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . My library will feed you . .. " We listened and shared slate data for the next two hours . When we finished , Bithras switched on his charm , and Miriam seemed receptive . I was relieved . The meetings with Cailetet and Sandoval , held in our suite , were cordial and totally unproductive . The associate syndic for Cailetet Earth hinted they might not support our unification proposals , that Cailetet Mars might have agreed to the proposals without Triple-wide authority . After , Bithras was agitated . Almost unconsciously , he stayed close to me , kept gently jostling me . Allen watched with some concern . I ignored it . Apparently , Miriam was not enough for him . And the pressure was building . I suffered a small lapse of bichemistry the next morning , alone in my room : nausea , chills , my body breaking through the brace of controls to adjust itself in the way it deemed best . That lasted only an hour , and I felt much better after . The gravity seemed less imposed , more natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond . A crystalline day with high puffy clouds . Washington DC a tiny village , its monuments and ancient domed Capitol visible only as grains of rice in the general green and brown . Intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic . . . A fatuous grin spread across my face . I was a Martian , come to invade Earth . Alice presented her report . We sat in the living room of our suite and scanned the highlights . Bithras dug deeper on several key points . " It 's not encouraging , " he said . " The need for central control of all solar resources may be acute within fifteen Earth years , " Alice said . " It is generally recognized that Earth needs a major endeavor to keep up its overall psychological and economic vigor , and that endeavor  --  that social focus  --  must be interstellar exploration on a grand scale . " Allen found that puzzling . " The whole Earth recognizes this ? Everybody agrees ? " " Agreement is strong among those groups who make the crucial decisions about the Triple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ma-r alliances . "  | " We 'll be pressured to join in the endeavor , whether or not it directly benefits Mars , " Bithras said . " Such a conclusion is overdetermined by the evidence , " Alice said . Bithras leaned back on the couch . " Nothing we ca n't roll with . " But he seemed troubled . " It 's a bit obvious , do n't you think ? " " Evidence for other conclusions is not clear , " Alice said . " It 's what some of our fellow passengers were saying , " I said . " Cut and dried , though , is n't it ? " Bithras said , biting his upper lip . He resembled a bulldog when he did that . " Tomorrow I 'll open the proposals and share them with you . I need you to fully understand what we 're allowed to say , and what we 're allowed to give , at each stage of negotia-tion . " He sat up . " From now , you are more than apprentices , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be born . You are diplomats . " And we acted the part . We attended receptions and parties , hosted two of our own , visited the offices of major corporations and temp agencies , attended dinners arranged by Mars appreciation societies .. . Miriam hosted our private reception in the hotel . I spent hours talking to explanetaries , listening to their stories of old Mars , answering their questions as best I could about the new Mars . Did Mackenzie Frazier ever unite the Canadian BMs in Syrtis ? Whatever became of the Prescott and Ware families in Hellas ? My sister still lives on Mars , Mariner Valley South , but she never answers my letters  --  do you know why ? All too often , I could only smile and plead ignorance . There was no Pan-Martian family message center or database easily accessible from Earth . I took a note on my slate to have Majumdar set one up ; good for PR . Ex-Martians on Earth could be valuable allies , I thought , and Miriam excepted , we did n't use them very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Miriam how often Martian BMs approached her , directly from Mars . " About once a year , " she said , smiling . I said that was deplorable , and she patted my shoulder . " We are such trusting and insular creatures , " she said . " By the time you leave here , you 'll know only too well what we 're up against , and how far we have to go to get in the spin . . . " I made a note on my slate that we should sign Miriam to Majumdar exclusively  --  but did n't that contradict the spirit of unity we were working so hard to demonstrate ? Visiting offices of members of Congress , I quickly noticed a remarkable lack of attention to Bithras 's hints at what our proposals might be . Bithras fell into a dark and snappish mood at the end of a grueling day of office-hopping.  | " They do n't much care , " he said , accepting a glass of wine from Allen as we rested in our suite . " That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews , conducted from a studio in the Capitol ; afternoons , more interviews from a studio in the hotel ; then lunches with major financiers who listened and smiled , but promised nothing ; finally , dinners with congressional staffers , full of curiosity and enthusiasm , but who also revealed little and promised nothing . Visits to schools in Washington and Virginia , usually over ed-nets from our hotel room . . . A quick train journey to Pennsylvania to meet with Amish Friends of Sylvan Earth , who had finally accepted the use of computers , but not thinkers . Back to Washington . . . A guided tour of the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum . The original Library of Congress had been sealed in helium and was accessible now only in pressure suits . We were not offered the chance to go in . Arbeiters roamed its halls , guarding and tracking its countless billions of paper books and periodicals . It had stopped accepting paper copies in 2049 ; most research was now conducted out of the electronic archives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old library . Alice absorbed as much of the library as she needed , but even her immense reserves of memory would have been taxed by absorbing all . At the Air and Space Museum , we stood for pictures at the foot of a full-size replica of the first Mars lander , the Captain James Cook . I had seen the original as a preform schoolgirl . To me , the replica seemed larger beneath its dome than the original , sitting in the open air of Elys-ium . Earth had too much to show us . We were in danger of becoming exhausted before our most important day arrived . . . We entered the hearing chamber , stately stone and warm dark wood , seats upholstered in dark faux leather ; Bithras , Allen , and myself , deliberately dressed in conservative Martian fashions , Alice on her freshly polished carriage . With our synthetic clothing and unaltered physiques , we must have resembled hicks in a LitVid comedy . But we were greeted respectfully by five senators from the Standing Committee on Solar System and NearEarth Space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light conversation with the senators and a few of their staff . The air was polite but formal . Again , I sensed something amiss , as did Bithras , whose nostrils flared as he took his seat behind a long maple table . Allen leaned over and asked  | me , " Why are n't we testifying before the whole committee ? " I did not know . I sat to the left of Bithras in a hard wooden chair ; Allen sat to his right . Alice was connected to the Senate thinker , Harold S. , who had served the Senate for sixty years . The gallery was empty . Obviously , this would be a closed hearing . Senator Kay Juarez Sommers of New Mexico , chair of the committee , gaveled the hearing into order . " I welcome our distinguished guests from Mars . You do n't know how odd that is for an old Terrie like myself to say , even today . Maybe I need some enhancements to the imagination . Certainly some of my colleagues think so . . . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when appearance seemed an arbitrary choice ; small and wiry , clean simple features , smooth-voiced , dressing hard in blacks and grays . Senator Juarez Sommers had not chosen any easy roads in her life , and she had eschewed obvious transform designs . Also attending the hearing today were Senators John Mendoza of Utah , tall , chocolate-skinned , severely handsome and stocky ; Senator David Wang of California , white-blond with golden skin , a fairly obvious transform ; and Senator Joe Kim of Green Idaho , of middle height , grayhaired , wearing an expression of perpetual suspicion . Or perhaps it was discernment . " Mr. Majumdar , as you can see , this is a closed hearing , " Juarez Sommers began . " We 've chosen key members of the standing committee to hear your testimony . We 'll speak directly , since our time is limited . We 're curious as to how much progress Mars will make toward unification in the next five years . " " We face major obstacles , " Bithras said , " not all of them caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Bithras explained the complex interactions of Binding Multiple finances and politics . Martian resources were about two percent developed . Earth-based corporations with BM subsidiaries and Lunar-based BMs controlled fifteen percent of Martian capital and ten percent of developed resources . Mars-based BMs frequently sought capital from Triple sources off Mars , establishing temporary liaisons , even giving the outside sources some say in their internal affairs . It seemed everybody had a finger in the Martian pie . Organizing so many disparate interests was more than difficult , it was nightmarish , and it was made worse by the reluctance of healthy and profitable BMs to submit to central authority . " Do Martian BMs feel they have inalienable rights , corporate rights as p 163 it were , no matter what the needs of their individual members ? " asked Senator Mendoza of Utah . " Nothing so arrogant , " Bithras said . " Binding Multiples operate more like groups of small businesses and families than worker-owned Earthstyle corporations . Family members are all shareholders , but they can not sell their shares to any outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special election , or birth . Transfer through marriage or election removes you from one BM and places you in another . Within the family , there is exchange of work credits only , no money as such . . . All investments outside the family are directed by the syndic 's financial managers . " The senators appeared bored . Bithras concluded quickly . " I 'm sure you 're familiar with the principles . . . They 're the same on the Moon and in the Belts , as well . " " Being aware of a pattern should imply being able to change it , " said Mendoza . " Our witness has just admitted to us that there is reluctance , " said Senator Wang of California , glancing at his colleagues with raised eye-brows . " Mr. Majumdar 's own Binding Multiple has been reluctant to cooperate with attempts to unify , " said Juarez Sommers . " Perhaps he can give us insight into both the reluctance , and the proposed nurturing of a new social pattern . " Bithras tilted his head to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant witness . " We have worked long and hard to determine our own destiny . We behave as strong-willed individuals within an atmosphere determined by mutual advantage . We are naturally not inclined to place our destinies and lives in the hands of agencies who do not answer directly to us . " " Your Binding Multiples have lived under this illusion for decades , " said Senator Joe Kim of Green Idaho . " Are you telling us this is truly how Mars works  --  each individual interacting directly with family author-ities ? " " No , " Bithras said . " Surely you have a system of justice that all BMs subscribe to . How do you treat your untherapied , your ill-adapted ? " " Have n't we strayed from the subject a bit , Senator ? " Bithras asked , smiling . " Humor me , " Kim said , looking down at the slate before him . I3ithras humored him . " They have rights . If their maladaptation is severe , their families persuade them to seek aid . Therapy , if that seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . crime transcends family boundaries , they can be brought before Council judges . But ? " " Martians are not enamored of therapy , " Mendoza said , staring at us one by one . " Some of us in Utah share their doubts . " " We do n't embrace the concept as a fashion , " Bithras clarified . " Neither do we oppose it on principle . " " We think perhaps an improvement in the mentality of Martians as individuals might lead to a greater acceptance of more efficient social organization , " Juarez Sommers said , glancing at Mendoza with some irritation . " The Senator is privileged to think that , " Bithras said quietly . That line of questioning was dropped . The senators paused for a few seconds , tuning in to Harold S. perhaps , then resumed the questioning . " You 're no doubt aware that the major alliances of Earth have expressed unhappiness with Martian backwardness , " Juarez Sommers said . " There 's even been disgruntled talk of economic sanctions . Mars relies heavily on Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not entirely , Senator , " Bithras said . She must have known we did not ; she was working toward some point I could not see . " Do your Binding Multiples conduct business with human brainpower alone , or do they use thinkers ? " " We rely on thinkers , but make our own decisions , of course , " Bithras said . " As you do here . . . in Congress . I believe Harold S. is merely a revered advisor . " " And these thinkers are grown on Earth , " she continued . " We have a few more years before we can grow our own Martian thinkers . " Bithras looked down at the table , rubbing the edge of his slate with a finger . His face reddened ever so slightly at what might have been an implied threat . " Martian nanotechnology is acknowledged to be a decade behind Earth 's , and your industrial facilities are likewise less efficient . " " Yes . " " Earth corporations and national patent trusts are reluctant to release designs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Martians have never smuggled designs and never sought to infringe patents . We have stringent oversight within all BMs on patent permissions and compensation . We also allow Earth inspections of facilities using patented or copyrighted designs . " " Still , the perception exists , and it hurts Martian industry and development , correct ? " " In all humility , " Bithras said , " I must say we take care of our needs . "  | What Bithras did not mention was the widespread Martian perception that Earth preferred our economic development to be stunted , kept tightly in Earth 's control . " Does n't Mars wish to grow ? " Mendoza asked , wide-eyed with astonishment . " Do n't Mars 's leaders  --  the syndics of the various BMs and the governors of resource districts  --  wish to join the greater efforts of the ' Tr- iple ? " " To the best of our poor abilities , yes , " Bithras said . " But Earth should never expect Mars to sell out her rights and her resources , to give herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My colleagues and I would n't dream of that . We ight hope for a place where we can flee , if our own re-elections hit " Speak for yourself , John , " Juarez Sommers said . The discussion settled into specifics , and trivial ones at that . For ten minutes , the senators tasked Bithras more questions whose answers it seemed obvious they could already find within their slates . The exercise quickly irritated and bored me . That first hearing , which reached no conclusions , lasted forty-seven minutes . The next , on the next day , with the same senators , lasted fifteen minutes . We were given a week 's reprieve before the final hearing , and no Indication we would ever meet with the full committee . So far , Bithras had not been asked to present his proposals . It did not Seem to matter . We had made the crossing to listen to polite but unpleasant banter , mild implied threats , and remarkably soft questions . Allen shared a bichem refresh and some beer with me on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " What do you think they 're up to ? " I asked . Allen closed his eyes wearily and lay back in the chair , legs stretched full length . " Wasting our time , " he said . " They do n't act as if they have a plan , " I said . " ' They do n't act like much of anything , " Allen said . " It 's infuriating . " " No , it 's cover , " Allen said . " Diversion . " " What do you mean by diversion ? " Bithras entered in his pajamas , stair tousled , rubbing his eyes like a little boy . " Give me some of that , " he said , flicking a finger at the bichemistry supplement . " My joints ache . " " Did we wake you ? "  | " Behind these walls ? It 's quiet as a tomb in there . I had a damned nightmare , " Bithras said . " I hate sims . " We were not aware he had experienced any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he slugged back with some drama . " Yes , all right , " he said , " I let Miriam talk me into sharing a sim with her last night . It was awful . " I wondered what sort of sim they had shared . " We were talking about the hearings , " Allen said . " You mentioned a diversion , ' " Bithras said . " You think these hearings are a sham ? " " I have my suspicions . " " Yes ? " " GEWA . " Bithras scowled at Allen . " We 've no scheduled meetings with representatives of GEWA . " " Because we 're not worth the bother ? " Allen asked . I was still lost . " What about ? " I began , but Bithras held up his hand . " Wang and Mendoza both act as representatives to GEWA for the Senate Standing Committee , " Bithras said . " Majority party and minor-ity . Allen nodded . " Gentlemen , you 've dusted me , " I said . Bithras turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been asserted by some that the United States is relinquishing its concerns in space to GEWA as a whole . Binding Multiples having contracts and trade relations with the United States will supposedly answer to GEWA authority , directly . " " What difference would that make to us ? " I asked . " GEWA as a whole is far more aggressive toward space exploration than the United States , and much more involved than any other alliance . But in the Greater East-West Alliance there are many smaller nations and corporations with no space holdings whatsoever . They want holdings . If Mars unites , we would have to establish new relations with GEWA . . . Their little partners would ask that we sell a share of our pie . And they would offer . . . " Bithras pinched his nose and squinched his eyes shut , concentrating . " What . . . what would they offer ? " " Quid pro quo , " Allen said . " Quid pro quo . We provide them a greater share of our participation in Solar System resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars and its BMs completely . " " As happened to the Moon , " Allen said .  | " That 's terrible , " I said . " You 're anticipating this , just because they have n't asked lots of hard questions ? " Bithras waved his hand . " Little evidences , certainly , " he said . Allen seemed energized by the frightful scenarios . " We could n't win that kind of war , " Allen said . " If we unite and are pressured to join any alliance , power in the alliance is based on population ? " " Except for the founding nations , such as the United States , " Bithras said . " We 'd be bottom of the totem pole . " He finished his bichem supplement . Allen offered him a glass of beer and he accepted . " In fifteen or twenty years , maybe less , if Alice is correct , ninety percent of the Earth 's nations , in every alliance , will be deeply interested in the Big Push . To the stars . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Allen said , leaning forward and clasping his hands in front of him like a supplicant . " At the price of our planetary heritage , our soul ? " Bithras asked . " The whole human race . . . It 's a noble goal , " Allen mused . Bithras took the challenge as if he were fielding a ball . " It would certainly seem noble , to a world desperate for progress , for growth and change . But we 'd be eaten alive . " " What 's the point ? " I asked . Bithras shrugged . " If this speculation is correct , and if our visit has any meaning at all , we will be speaking with representatives from GEWA , in private , before we leave , " he said . " The closed Senate hearing is an excuse  --  no need to go public with policies not yet in place , but also , no need conducting long-term negotiations ignoring what the situation will be in the future . Mendoza and Wang are merely pickets . The reason we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be caught with our pants around our ankles . I 've come here with a proposal .. . But they might try to force us to make a firm agreement . " He held out his hand and Allen grasped it firmly . " Good thinking , Allen . If I were them , that 's what I would do . " Staring at the congratulatory handshake , I felt a burn of jealousy . Would I ever be able to think such convoluted and political thoughts , make such startling leaps into the unlikely , and impress Bithras ? I patted Allen on the shoulder , mumbled good night , and went to my room . The next morning , as I shared coffee in the suite 's living room with Bithras , talking about the day 's schedule with Alice , our slates chimed simultaneously . Allen entered from his room and we compared mes-sages.  | All further Senate hearings had been canceled . Informal sessions with senators and members of congress from various states had all been canceled , as well  --  except for a single meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third week . Suddenly , we were little more than tourists . The GEWA hypothesis had quickened . I quickly tired of parties and receptions . I wanted to see the planet , walk around on my own , free of responsibilities . Instead , we spent mo of our time meeting the curious and the friendly , making contacts and spreading goodwill . Miriam , true to her reputation , arranged for us to meet and greet some of the most influential people in North America . She arranged a second lavish party  --  paid for by Majumdar  --  and i vited artists , sim actors , business magnates and heads of corporatio ministers from the alliances , ambassadors  --  more famous and famili faces than I had ever imagined meeting all at once . The LitVids we conspicuously absent ; we were to be at ease , light chatter and fine ft ) and Bithras was to make his case for a variety of deals and proposals . The party was held in Miriam 's suite , all the walls and furniture arranged for maximum space . We arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside with a motherly arm around my shoulder . " D be too impressed by these people , " she told me . " They 're human they 're easily impressed . You 're an exotic , my dear  --  and you should t advantage of it . There will be some very handsome people here . " gave me an unctuous smile . I certainly was n't going to harvest partners at a political function . Bu returned her smile and said I 'd enjoy myself , and I vowed to myself tha would . The crowd arrived in clumps , flocking to core figures of some repu tion or another . Allen , Bithras , and I separated and attended to our clumps , answering questions ? " Why have you come all this way ? " ; " are Martians so resistant to the big arts trends ? " ; " I 've heard that half of all Martian women still give birth  --  how extraordinary ! Is t true in your family ? " ; " What do you think of Earth ? Is n't it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend to other clum While I recognized many famous people , Miriam had managed invite nobody I truly wanted to meet . None of the Terrestrial dramatis admired were there , perhaps because I favored Lit over Vid . None of politicians I had studied were there . The majority of the partygoers high spin  --  Washington still attracted hordes of bright and beautiful I ple  --  and my tastes did not track the spin . p 169 Bithras seemed in his element , however , fulfilling his obligations smoothly . For much of the party , executives from corporations with Martian aspirations surrounded him . I noticed four Pakistanis waiting patiently for a turn , two men in traditional gray suits and two women , one wearing a brilliant orange sari , the other a flowing gray three-piece set . When their turn came , Bithras spoke with them in Punjabi and Urdu ; he became even more ebullient . Allen passed by and winked at me . " How fares it ? " he asked . We were out of hearing of others , in a corner where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , very softly . " Where 's Bithras ? " He had left the room . " He 's talking old times with the Pakistanis , I think , " Allen said . " How can you be bored ? There are some very famous people here . " " I know . I blame myself . " " Uh huh . You 'd rather be hiking the Adirondacks , or ? " " Do n't make my mouth water , " I said . " Duty , honor , planet , " he said , and left to attend to another clump . Bithras reappeared ten or fifteen minutes later , speaking earnestly with one of the Pakistani women . The woman listened attentively , nodding frequently . His face glowed with enthusiasm , and I felt glad for him . I could n't understand a word they said , however . The party had expanded to fill the available space , and still more people were arriving . Miriam flitted from point to point in the crowd , rearranging conversations , herding people toward food or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving now were , to my eye , beyond exotic . A musician from Hawaii and three young women in close-fitting black caps took much of the heat away from Allen and me . I recognized him from news stories . His name was Attu . Gaunt and intense , he dressed in a severe black suit . He had linked his consciousness with the three women , who dressed in filmy white , and whom he referred to as sisters . At intervals of ten minutes , they would rejoin , clasp hands , and exchange all their experiences . The women never spoke ; Attu was their conduit . I avoided them . That sort of intimacy ( and implied male domination ) spooked me . I wondered why Miriam had invited them . The evening was winding down , and the crowd beginning to diminish , when I saw one of the Pakistani men approach Miriam . Miriam raised herself on tiptoes and looked around , shook her head , and went off in search . Intuition had little to do with my guess that they were looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made my way down a  | hall that led to several smaller rooms . I did not want to interrupt anything private , but I had a bad feeling . A door slid open suddenly and the Pakistani woman bumped into me . With a quick , angry glance , she rustled past in her long gray dress . Bithras emerged a moment later , biting his lower lip , eyes darting . He sidestepped me and said , " It is nothing , it is nothing . " The Pakistanis gathered near the main door , talking heatedly . They searched the faces of the remaining party guests , focused on Bithras , and one of the men began to shove through other partygoers in his direction . The women restrained him , however , and the four departed . Miriam stood at the door for a moment , uncertain what to do . Bithras sat in a chair , staring blankly , before standing with deliberation and going for a drink . Like me , he was having only juice . Nothing more was said . An hour later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten hours locked in his room with the lights out . He accepted his meals through the half-open door , glared at us owlishly , and shut it . Allen and I spent this time studying Alice 's fresh reports on GEWA and GSHA . The following morning , Bithras stepped out of his room in his bathrobe , hands on hips , and said , " It is time to take a vacation . You have two days . Do what you will . Be back here , in this room , by seven in the morning of Saturday next . " " You 're taking some time off , as well , Uncle ? " Allen asked . Bithras smiled and shook his head . " I 'll be talking with a lot of people ... If we were better than children at this sort of thing , we 'd have brought an entire negotiating team . Nobody wanted to spend the money . " He practically spat the last three words . There were circles under his eyes ; his skin had grayed with stress . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set policy for an entire world . If this is a new era for relations with Earth . . . " He waved his hand in the air as if describing the flight of birds . " It will take days to sort things out with the other syndics and governors . Alice will postpone her kiss with Jill and advise me . But you would only distract me . If I ca n't come up with a way to turn this to our advantage , I will resign as syndic . " His smile turned wolfish . " You can play their game . They think we are provincials , suckers for the taking . Maybe we are . You shall certainly act the part . Give interviews if you are asked . Say I am bewildered and disconsolate , and I do not know where to turn next . We are dismayed at  | the social slight , and find Earth to be incredibly rude . " He sat and rested his head in his hands . " May not be too far wrong . " I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours , ( ) rianna returned my call and we made plans for a rendezvous in New York . Allen had his own plans ; he was flying to Nepal . An hour before I left the hotel , I felt dizzy and frightened . I wondered how we would be received on Mars if we failed here ; what would our families think ? If Bithras tumbled , would my career within Majumdar BM tumble with him ? By choosing to go with Bithras , I had become part of a monumental war of nerves , and it seemed clear we were losing . I resented being caught between two worlds ; I hated power and authority and the very real , sweaty misery of responsibility . I might be part of a failure of historic proportions ; I could disgrace my mother and father , my Binding Multi-ple . I longed for the small warrens and cramped tunnels of Mars , for my confined and secure youth . I knew there were bigger cities , more crowded cities  --  but New York 's fifty million citizens caused this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fear of the unknown to fear that I would /imply be sucked up and digested . Five hundred and twenty-three years old , New York appeared both cient and new at once . I emerged from Penn Station surrounded by a rainbow of people , more than I had ever seen crowded together in one ace in my life . I stood on a corner as hordes walked in a cold breeze d spatters of sleet . In design , New York had kept much of its architectural history intact , t there was hardly a building that had not been rebuilt or replaced . rchitectural nano had worked its way through frames and walls , down rough the soil and ancient foundations , redrawing wires and fibers , routing water pipes and sewers , leaving behind buildings resculpted in original or better materials , new infrastructures of metal and ceramic d plastic . Nothing seemed designed as a whole ; everything had been trembled and even reassembled bits at a time , block by block or build-g by building . And of course many of the buildings a New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mars . The people also had been rebuilt from the inside . Even in my confum , they fascinated me . New people in New York the old city : trans-  | forms , their skins glistening like polished marble , black or white or rose , their golden or silver or azure eyes glinting as they passed , penetrating glances that seemed both friendly and challenging at once ; designer bodies put on for a month or a year , the flesh shaped like clay ; designs identifying status and social group , some ugly as protest , some thin and austere , others large and strong and  --  Earthy . Lights flashed over the street , airborne arbeiters like fairies on a trod in one of my children 's vids , or , even more fantastic , huge fireflies ; arbeiters flowed through the city in narrow channels underground and above . Slaved cabs followed glassy strips pressed into the asphalt and concrete and nano stone of the streets . What fascinated me most about New York was that it worked . Most submitted to medical nano , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the city 's people were healthy , but medical arbeiters still patrolled the streets , searching for the untherapied few who might even now out of negligence or perverse self-destruction fall ill . Human diseases had been virtually eliminated , replaced by infestations of learning , against which I had chosen to be made immune . New Yorkers , like most people on Earth , lived in a soup of data itself alive . Language and history and cultural updates filled the air . Viruses and bacteria poured forth from commercial ventilators in key locations , or could be acquired at infection booths , conveying everything the driven New Yorker might want to know . Immunizations prevented adverse reactions for natural visitors not used to the soup . The sun passed behind a broad cubical comb in New Jersey and lights flashed on , pouring golden illumination through the gentle drizzle . Advertising images leaped from walls , a flood of insistent icons that meant little to me . Spot marketing had been turned into a perfected science . Consumers were paid to carry transponders which communicated their interests to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to purchase : products , proprietary LitVids , new Sims , live event schedules . Being a consumer had become a traditional means of gainful employment ; some New Yorkers floated careers allowing themselves to be subjected to ads , switching personal IDs as they traveled to different parts of the city , trading purchase credits earned by ad exposure for more ad income . Lacking a transponder , all I saw were the icons , projected corporate symbols floating above my head like strange hovering insects . According to what I had been taught in govmanagement at UM , Earth 's economic systems had become so complicated by the twenty-first century that only thinkers could model them . And as thinkers grew more  | complicated , economic patterns increased in complexity as well , until all was delicately balanced on less than the head of a pin . No wonder cultural psychology could play a key role in economic sta-bility . " Casseia ! " Orianna stood on a low wall , peering over the crowds . We hugged at the edge of the walkway . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I laughed and shook my head , drunk with what I had seen . " I feel like a ? " " Fish out of water ? " Orianna said , grinning . " More like a bird drowning ! " She laughed . " Calcutta would kill you ! " " Let 's not go there , " I said . " Where we 're going , my dear , is a quiet place my Mom owns up on East 64th , in a historic neighborhood . A bunch of friends want to meet you . " I only have a few days ... " " Simplicity ! This is so exciting ! You 're even in the LitVids , did you know that ? " " Oh , God , yes . " We took an autocab and she projected the news stories from her slate . She had hooked an Earthwide ex net and scanned for all material related to our visit . The faces of Bithras , Allen and myself floated like little doll heads in the autocab . Condensed texts and icons flashed at reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-thirds of what was being said . GEWA and GSHA had linked with Eurocom to propose a world-wide approach to what was being called the Martian Question : Martian reluctance or inability to join the Push . " You 're being pre-jammed , " Orianna said cheerfully . I was horrified . The sidebars detailed our personal histories and portrayed us as the best Martian diplomacy had to offer ; the last seemed ironic , but I really could n't fathom the spin . " You 're famous , dear , " Orianna said . " A frontier girl . Little House on the Planum . They love it ! " I was less interested in what was being said about me than in the backslate details . GEWA , leading the other alliances , would start negotiating with Mars after completion of what the US government was characterizing as " polite dialogues " with members of the standing Congressional committee . I had a role to play . True shock would only grace my performance . " It 's  | terrible , " I said , frowning deeply . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Earth . " " Oh , do ! " Orianna said , creasing her brow in sympathy . The cab stopped before a stone and steel eight-story building with dazzling crys-tal-paned glass doors . The first-floor door popped open with a sigh and she danced ahead of me through crowds flowing along the walkway . " By the time my friends and I are done with you , you 'll expect anything ! " We do n't stay here often , " Orianna said , emerging from the elevator . Her long legs carried her down the hall like an eager colt . She slowed only to allow me to catch up with her . " Mother 's given us the space here for a few days . My hab is just like the one in Paris . I 've kept it since I was a kid . " The door to apartment 43 looked tame enough ? paneled wood with brass numbers . Orianna palmed entry and the door swung inward . " We have a guest , " she called . Beyond stretched a round gray tunnel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , unshaped . " Welcome home . What can we do for you , Orianna ? " a soft masculine voice asked . " Fancy conservative decor  --  for our guest  --  and tell Shrug and Kite to rise and meet my friend . " The tunnel quickly shaped a cream-colored decor with gold details , a rosewood armoire opening its doors to accept my coat and Orianna 's shoulder wrap . " English Regency , " Orianna said . " Kite 's idea of conser-vatism . " Shrug , Kite  --  it all sounded very drive . I wondered if I would regret coming . " Do n't stick on the names , " Orianna said , shaping the living room into more Regency . " All my friends are into Vernoring . They work and play with fake names . I do n't know their true ones . Not even their parents know . " " Why ? " " It 's a game . Two rules  --  nobody knows what you 're doing , and you do nothing illegal . " " Does n't that take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wow  --  crypto ! Hide in the tomb . Sorry . I shy from two-edged words . We call it Vernoring . " " Does n't it ? " I persisted . " No , " Orianna said thoughtfully . " Illegal is harm . Harm is stupid . Stupid is its own game , and none of my friends play it . Here 's Kite . " Kite came through a double door dressed in faded denim shirt and p 175 pants . He stood two meters high , minus a few centimeters , and carried a green-and-white mottled sun kitten . Orianna introduced us . Kite smiled and performed a shallow bow , then offered his free hand . He seemed natural enough  --  handsome but not excessively so , manner a little shy . He squatted cross-legged on the oriental carpet and the sun kitten played within a Persian garden design . A light switched on overhead and bathed the animal in a spot of brightness . It mewed appreciatively and stretched on its back . " We 're going out tonight , " Orianna said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . He 's spent the last three days working a commis-sion . " " Well , wake him up ! " " You do it , " Kite said . " Pleasure 's mine . " Orianna leaped from the chair and returned to the hall . We heard her banging on doors . " She could just buzz him , " Kite said ruefully , shaking his head . " She pretends she 's a storm , sometimes . " I murmured assent . " But she 's really sweet . You must know that . " " I like her a lot , " I said . " She 's an only and that makes a difference , " Kite added . " I have a brother and sister . You ? " " A brother , " I said . " And lots of blood relations . " Kite smiled . The smile rendered his face transcendentally beautiful . I blinked and looked away . " Is it rough , having everyone vid you ? " " I 'm getting tired of it . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shake hands with . That sort of thing . Some of the LitVids are casual about privacy . They could plant watchers on you . " He held up pinched fingers and peered through a tiny gap . " Some are micro . Hide anywhere . " " Is n't that against the law ? " " If you have n't filed for privacy rights , they could argue you 're com-mon-law open . Then you 'd only be protected in surveillance negative areas . The watchers would turn off . . . Most of the time . " " That 's bolsh , " said a deep , lion-like voice . I turned to see Orianna dragging into the room by one hand a very large , blocky man with a very young face . " Nobody 's planted a watcher without permission in four years , " the young-faced man said . " Not since Wayne vs . LA PubEye . " " Casseia Majumdar , of Mars , this is Shrug . He 's studied law . He has almost as many enhancements as I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I barely reached his chin when he kneeled . " Charmed , " he said , kissing my hand . " Stop that , " Orianna said . " She 's my partner . " " You do n't curve , " Shrug said . " We 're sisters of sim , " Orianna said . " Oh , dear , such an arc ! " Kite said , smiling . I do n't think I understood a third of what was said the whole time I spent in New York . Back on the streets , holding hands with Shrug and Orianna , and then with Orianna and Kite , I let myself be taken somewhere , anywhere . Kite was really very attractive and did not seem averse to flirting , though more to aggravate Orianna , I thought , than to impress me . My slate recorded streets and directions in case I needed to find my way back to Penn Station ; it also contained full-scale maps of the city , all cities on the Earth , in fact . I could hardly get lost unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that New York was virtually free of thieves . " Too bad , " I said , in a puckish mood . " Yeah , " Orianna said . " But that does n't mean there 's no risk . It 's risk we choose that we should beware . " " I choose lunch , " Kite said . " There 's a great old delicatessen here . Total goback . " My expression of surprise caught his eye . " Goback . Means retro , atavistic , historic . All are good drive words now , no negs . " " It means something else on Mars , " I said . " Folks who want to keep BM rule are called Gobacks , " Orianna said . " Are you a Goback ? " Shrug asked me . " I 'm neutral , " I said . " My family has strong links to BM autonomy . I 'm still learning . " Echoing the theme , we passed a family of Chasids dressed in black . The men wore wide-brimmed hats and styled their hair in long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple dresses in natural fabrics . The children skipped and danced happily , dressed in black and white . " They 're lovely , are n't they ? " Orianna said , glancing over her shoulder at the family . " Total goback ! No enhancements , no therapy , neg the drive . " " New York is great for that sort of thing , " Kite said . We passed three women in red chadors ; a woman herding five blue dogs , followed by an arbeiter carrying a waste can ; five men in single file ,  | nude , not that it mattered  --  their bodies were completely smooth , with featureless tan skin ; a male centaur with half-size horse body , perfectly at home cantering along the sidewalk , man 's portion clothed in formal Edwardian English wool suit and bowler ; jaguar-pelted women , furry , not in furs ; two young girls , perhaps ten Earth years , dressed in white ballet gowns with fairy wings growing from their backs ( temp or permanent ? I could n't tell ) ; a gaggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escorted by men in black cassocks ( " Papal Catholics , " Kite said ) ; more of the mineral-patterned designer bodies ; a great many people who might have fit in without notice on Mars ; and of course the mechaniques , who replaced major portions of their bodies with metal shells filled with biorep nano . That , I had heard , was very expensive as an elective . Complete body replacement was much cheaper . Neither could be done legally unless one could prove major problems in birth genotype ; it spun too much of the Eloi and Ten Cubed . " After lunch , we 're going to Central Park , " Orianna said . " And then . .. " Kite laughed . " Orianna has connections . She wants to show you something you just do n't have on Mars . " " An Omphalos ! " Orianna said . " Father owns shares . " We ate in the delicatessen and it smelled of cooked meat , which I had never smelled before , and which offended me all the same , whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive folks , a high proportion of transforms  --  lined up before glass cases filled with what appeared to be sliced processed animals . Plastic labels on metal skewers pronounced the shapes to be Ham , that is , smoked pig legs , Beef ( cows ) corned ( though having nothing to do with corn ) and otherwise , something called Pastrami which was another type of cow covered with pepper , smoked fish , fish in fermented dairy products , vegetables in brine and vinegar , pig feet in jars , and other things that , had they been real , would have caused a true uproar even on Earth . We stood at the counter until the clerk took our order , then found a table . Martian reserve kept me from expressing my distaste to Orianna . She ordered for me  --  potato salad , smoked salmon , a bagel , and cream cheese . " The stuff here is the best in town , " she said . " It was set up by New York Preserve . History scholars . They have a nano artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have state dispensation to cat meat , for religious reasons . He quit eating meat ten years ago , but he remembers what it tastes like . "  | Our food arrived . The salmon appeared raw , felt slimy-soft , and tasted salty and offensive . " You have imitation meat on Mars , do n't you ? " Kite asked . " It is n't so authentic , " I said . " It does n't smell like this . " " Blame the drive for history , " Shrug said . " Nothing immoral about imitation . It does n't hurt , it does n't waste , it teaches us what New York used to be like ... " " I do n't think Casseia 's enjoying her lox , " Kite said , smiling sympathetically . My heart sank in hopeless attraction , simply looking at his face . " Maybe it 's turned , " I said . " It does taste rank , " Kite said . " Maybe it 's the fake preservatives . Things do n't turn any more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inability to enjoy the treat . " Tailored bacteria . Eat only what they 're meant to . " " The Earth , " Shrug said portentously , " is a vast zoo . " They fell to discussing whether " zoo " was the right word . They settled on " garden . " " Do you have many murders on Mars ? " Shrug asked . " A few . Not a lot , " I answered . " Shrug 's fascinated by violent crime , " Orianna said . " I 'd love to defend a genuine murderer . They 're so rare now . . . Ten murders in New York last year . " " Among fifty million citizens , " Kite said , shaking his head . " That 's what therapy has done to us . Maybe we do n't care enough to kill any more . " Orianna made a tight-lipped blat . " No , really , " Kite said . " Shrug says he 'd love to defend a murder case . A real one . But he 'll probably never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to say the word . " " So what 's passion like on Mars ? " Shrug asked . " Murderous ? " I laughed . " The last murder I heard about , a wife killed her husband on an isolated station . Their family  --  their Binding Multiple  --  had suffered pernicious exhaustion ? " " Love the words ! " Shrug said . " Of funds . They were left alone at the station without a status inquiry for a year . The BM was fined , but could n't pay its fine . It 's pretty un-usual , " I concluded . " We therapy disturbed people , too . " " Ah , but is murder a disturbance ? " Kite asked , straining to be provoca-tive . " You 'd think so if you were the victim , " I said .  | " Too much health , too much vigor  --  too few dark corners , " Kite said sadly . " What is there left to write about ? Our best LitVids and sims use untherapied characters . But how do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to make sims , but sanity is really limiting . " " He 's opening his soul to you , " Orianna said . " He does n't tell people that unless he likes them . " " There 's plenty of story in conflicts between healthy folks , " I suggested . " Political disagreements . Planning decisions . " Kite shook his head sadly . " Hardly takes us to the meaning of existence . Hardly stretches us to the breaking point . You want to live that kind of life ? " I did n't know how to answer . " That 's what I 'm doing now , " I finally replied . " Up your scale , " Shrug advised Kite . " She 's right . The clash of organizations , governments . Still possible . GEWA against GSHA . Might make a bestseller . " " They 're even taking that away from us , " Kite said . " No wars , nothing but economic frictions behind closed doors . Nothing to make the heart pound . " " Kite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to genuinely irritate him . " Not at all , " he said . " The Romantics wanted to destroy themselves . " " Spoken like a true child of our time , " Shrug said . " Kite pushes healthy as they come . Passion  --  life to the limit  --  but no risk , please . " Kite grinned . " I never met a passion I did n't like , " he said . " I just do n't want to be owned by one . " An actor portraying a waiter took my dish away . The Omphalos stood on five hectares at the southern end of Manhattan , near Battery Park . It looked immensely strong , a cube surrounded by smaller cubes , all gleaming white with gold trim . At the gate , on the very edge of the compound , Orianna presented her palm and answered a few questions posed by a blank-faced security arbeiter . A human guard met us , took us into an adjoining room , sat behind a desk , and asked our reasons for taking the tour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident , " Orianna said . I looked at her in surprise ; this had not been her stated purpose earlier . " I 'll need your true names and affiliations even to apply for a clear-ance , " he said . " That leaves us out , " Shrug said . Kite nodded agreement . " We 'll wait  | outside . " Orianna said we would n't be more than an hour or two . An arbeiter escorted them to the front gate . The guard quickly checked our public ratings for security violations and mental status . " You 're Martian , " he said , glancing at me . " Not using a Vernor . " I admitted that I was . " Terries trying to impress you ? " the guard asked , glancing pointedly at Orianna . " Are you Martian ? " I asked him . " No . I 'd like to go there some day . " He referred to his slate and nodded approval . " I have your CV and pictures from a hundred different LitVid sources . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omphalos Six , your first glimpse of Heaven . Please stay with your assigned guide . " " What are your connections , besides your father owning shares ? " I asked Orianna as an arbeiter took us through an underground tunnel to the main cube . " I have a reservation for when I turn two centuries , " Orianna said . " I do n't know if I 'll use it . I might just die instead . . . " She grinned at me . " Easy to say now . I might go Eloi and end up on Mars or in the Belt .. . Who knows what things will be like then ? " " Who are we going to talk to ? " I asked . " A friend . " She held her finger to her lips . " The Eye is watching . " " What 's that ? " " The Omphalos thinker . Very high-level . Not at all like Alice , believe me  --  the best Earth can produce . " I quelled my impulse to defend Alice . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was equally impressive . An atrium rose twenty meters above a short walkway . The walkway ended on an elevator shaft that rose to the apex of the atrium , and sank below us through a glittering black pool . Nano stone walls , floors isolated from the walls by several dozen centimeters , sprung-shocked and field-loaded to withstand external stress  --  and damage repair stations in each corner . Conservative and solid . " Above us are the apartments , " Orianna said . " About ten thousand occupants . One hundred apartments are full-size , for those folks who want to log in and out every few weeks . The uncommitted , you might say . The rest are cubicles for warm sleep . " " They spend their time dreaming ? " " Custom sims and remote sensing . Omphalos has androids and arbeiters all over the Earth with human-resolution senses . Omphalos can p 181 access any of them at any time , and there you are  --  they are . The occupants can be anywhere they want . Some of the arbeiters can project full images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in person . If you just want to retire and relax , Omphalos employs the very finest sim designers . Overdrive arts and lit fantasies . " From my reading , and from Orianna 's description on Tuamotu , I knew that most of Omphalos 's residents stayed in long-term warm sleep , their bodies bathed in medical nano . Technically speaking , they were not Eloi ? they could not walk around , occupy a new citizen 's space or employment opportunities  --  but their projected life spans were unknown . Omphalos served as refuge for the very wealthy and very powerful who did not want to be voided to the Belt or Mars , yet wanted to live longer . Medical treatment that cleansed and purified and exercised and toned and kept body and mind healthy and fit  --  medical treatment unending ? slipped through a legal loophole . This Omphalos , and the forty-two structures like it around the world , were not beloved by the general population . But they had woven their legal protections deep into the Earth 's governments . " Why would n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Orianna had skipped ahead of me . She hunched her shoulders . " Gives nee the willies , " she said . She called the elevator , which arrived immedi-ately . The elevator stopped . Orianna took my hand and led me down a hallway that might have belonged in a plush hotel , retro early twentieth . Flowers filled cloisonne vases on wooden tables ; we walked on nonmetabolic carpet , probably real wool , deep green with white floral insets . Orianna found the door she wanted . She knocked lightly and the door opened . We entered a small white room with three Empire chairs and a table . The room smelled of roses . The wall before the chairs brightened . A high-res virtual image presented itself to us , as if we looked through glass at a scene beyond . A black-haired , severely handsome woman of late middle years sat on a white cast-iron chair in the middle of a beautiful garden , trees shading her , rows of bushes covered with lovely roses red and blue and yellow marching in perspective off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizon . It looked like a hot , humid , thundery day . " Hello , Miss Muir , " Orianna greeted the woman . She looked familiar , hut I could n't place her face . " Hello , Ori ! How nice to have visitors . " She smiled sunnily . " Miss Muir , this is my friend , Casseia Majumdar of Mars . " " Pleased to meet you , " the woman said .  | " Do you know Miss Muir , Casseia ? " " I 'm sorry , no . " Orianna shook her head and pursed her lips . " No enhancements . Always leaves you at a disadvantage . This is President Danielle Muir . " That name I had heard . " President of the United States ? " I asked , my face betraying how impressed I was . " Forty years ago , " Muir said , cocking her head to one side . " Practically forgotten , except by friends , and by my goddaughter . How are you , Ori ? " " I 'm high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . You know we 've been away . " " To Mars . You returned on the same ship with Miss Majumdar ? " " I did . And I confess I 've come here with a motive . " " Something interesting , I hope . " " Casseia 's being jammed , ma'am . I 'm too ignorant to speck what 's happening . " Ex-President Muir leaned forward . " Do tell . " Orianna raised her hand . " May I ? " " Certainly , " Muir said . A port thrust from the wall , and Orianna touched her finger to the pad , transferring information to Muir . I specked the former President lying in warm sleep behind the screen , bathed in swirling currents of red and white medical nano like strawberry juice and cream . Muir smiled and adjusted her chair to face us . The effect startled me ? even ambient sound told us we were with her , outdoors . The walls of the cubicle gradually faded into scenery . Soon we , too , were in the shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I smelled roses , fresh-cut grass , and something that raised the hair on my arms . Electricity .. . thunderstorms . " You work for a big financial Binding Multiple . Rather , you 're part of the family , right , Casseia ? " Her voice , colored by a melodious southern accent , drifted warm and concerned in the thick air . " Yes , ma'am , " I said . " You 're under pressure . . . You 've been summoned to testify before Congress , but for one reason or another , you 've been shunted to another rail . " " Yes , ma'am , " I said . " Why ? " I looked at Ori . " I really ca n't reveal family matters here , ma'am . Ori ? Orianna brought me here without telling me why . I 'm honored to meet you , but . . . " I trailed off , embarrassed . p 183 Muir tilted her head back . " Someone in the alliances has decided Mars is an irritant , and I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States , or to GEWA or GSHA or Eurocom or any of the other alliances . " Orianna frowned at me and looked back at Muir 's image . " My father says there is n't a politician on Earth you can trust , except Danielle Muir , " Orianna said . My level of skepticism rose enormously ; I 've always bristled when people ask for , much less demand , trust . Face to face with a ghost , an illusory representative of someone I had never met in person , I simply would not let myself bestow trust it was not my right or station to give . On the other hand , much of what we were doing was public knowledge ? and there was no reason not to carry on a conversation at that level . " Martians have stood apart from Solar System unification , " I said . " Good for you , " Muir said , smiling foxily . " Not everybody should knuckle under to the alliances . " " Well , it 's not entirely good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to unify . Earth expects full participation from coherent partners . We seem to be unable to meet their expectations . " " The Big Push , " Muir said . " Right , " Orianna said . " That seems to be part of it . " Muir shook her head sadly . " My experience with Martians when I was President was that Mars had great potential . But this Big Push could get along nicely without you . You 'd hardly be missed . " I felt another burn . " We think we might have a lot to contribute , actually . " " Unwilling to participate , but proud to be asked , proud to . have pressure applied , is that it ? " Muir said . " Not exactly , ma'am , " I said . Her face  --  the face of her image  --  hardened almost imperceptibly . Despite her warm tone and friendly demeanor , I sensed a chill of negative Judgment . " Casseia , Ori tells me you 're very smart , very capable , but you 're missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little in any Big Push . Mars is small in the Solar System scheme of things . What can you contribute , that would be worth the effort Earth seems to be willing to expend on you ? " I was at a loss for an answer . Bithras , I remembered , had been wary of this explanation , but I had swallowed it uncritically . " Maybe you know something you ca n't tell me , and I do n't expect you  | to tell me , considering your responsibilities and loyalties . But take it from an old , old politician , who helped plant  --  much to my regret  --  some of the trees now bearing ripe fruit . The much-ballyhooed Big Push is only a cover . Earth is deeply concerned about something you have , or can do , or might be able to do . Since you ca n't mount an effective military operation , and your economic strength is negligible , what could Mars possibly have , Casseia , that Earth might fear ? " " I do n't know , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the large and the strong , something that will mean strategic changes . Surely you can think of what that might be . How could Mars possibly threaten Earth ? " " We ca n't , " I said . " As you 've told me , we 're weak , insignificant . " " Do you think politics is a clean , fair game played by rational hu-mans ? " " At its best , " I said lamely . " But in your experience ... " " Martian politics has been pretty primitive , " I admitted . " Your uncle Bithras . . . Is he politically sophisticated ? " " I think so , " I said . " You mean , compared to you , he seems to be . " My discomfort ramped . I did not like being grilled , even by my social superiors . " I suppose , " I said . " Well , politics is not all muck , and not always corrupting , but it is never easy . Getting even rational people from similar backgrounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with separate histories , widely different perspectives , is a political nightmare . I would hesitate to accept the task , and yet your uncle seems to have jumped in with both feet . " " He 's cautious , " I said . " He 's a child playing in the big leagues , " Muir said . " I disagree , " I said . Muir smiled . " What does he think is really going on here ? " " For the moment , we accept that Earth needs Mars . . . prepared for some large-scale operation . The Big Push seems as likely as anything . " " You truly believe that ? " " I ca n't think of any other reason . " " My dear , your planet  --  your culture  --  may depend on what happens in the next few years . You have a responsibility I do n't envy . " " I 'm doing my very best , " I said . Muir hooded her gray eyes . I realized that she had asked me questions as one politician to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p 185 Orianna regarded me sadly , as if she had also discovered the weaknesses of a friend . " I do n't mean to offend , " Muir said . " I thought we were dealing with a political problem . " " I 'm not offended , " I lied . " Orianna took me all over New York today , and I 'm a little stunned . I need to rest and absorb it all . " " Of course , " Muir said . " Ori , give your mother and father my best wishes . It 's grand to see you again . Good-bye . " Abruptly , we sat facing the blank white wall . Orianna stood . Her mouth was set in a firm line and her eyes were determined not to meet mine . Finally , she said , " Everybody here acts a little . . . abrupt at times . It 's the way they experience time , I think . Casseia , we did n't come here to make you feel inferior . That was the farthest thing from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you agree ? " I said quietly . " Mars is not useless . " " Please do n't let patriotism blind you , Casseia . " I clamped my mouth shut . No eighteen-year-old Earth child was going to talk down to me that way . " Listen to what she was asking . She 's very sharp . You have to find out where you might be strong . " " Our strength is so much more ? " I cut myself off . Than Earth can imagine . Our spiritual strength . I was about to launch into a patriotic defense that even I did not believe . In truth , they were right . Mars did not breed great politicians ; it bred hateful little insects like Dauble and Connor , or silly headstrong youths like Sean and Gretyl . I hated having my face ground into the unpleasant truth . Mars was a petty world , a spiteful and grumbling world . How could it possibly be any danger to vigorous , wise , together Earth ? Orianna glanced at the blank wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you uncomfortable . I should have talked to you about it first . " " It 's an honor , " I said . " I just was n't prepared . " " Let 's find Kite and Shrug , " she suggested . " I ca n't imagine living here . " She shivered delicately . " But then , maybe I 'm old-fashioned . " We rejoined Kite and Shrug and spent several hours shopping in Old New York , real shops with nothing but real merchandise . I felt doubly old-fashioned  --  dismayed and disoriented by a district that was itself supposed to be a historical recreation . Kite and Shrug entered an early twenty-one haberdashery , and we followed . An officious clerk placed them in sample booths , snapped their images with a quaint 3-D digitizer ,  | then showed them how they might look in this season 's fashions . The clerk made noises of approval over several outfits . " We can have them for you in ten minutes , if you care to wait . " Kite ordered a formal socializing suit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shrug declined to purchase anything . We were heading out the door when the clerk called to us , " Oh ! Excuse me  --  I almost forgot . Free tickets to Circus Mind for customers . . . and their friends . " Kite accepted the tickets and handed them to us . He stuffed his in his mouth and chewed thoughtfully . " Are we all going ? " he asked . " What is it ? " Orianna asked . " Ori does n't know something ! " Shrug exclaimed , amused . " It must be really new , " she said , irritated . " Oh , it is , " the clerk said . " Very drive . " " Power live sim , " Kite said . " It 's abso fresh . All free until it draws a nightly crowd . Would you like to try , Casseia ? " " It could be too much , " Orianna cautioned . I took that as a challenge . Although tired and a little depressed from my meeting with Muir , I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kite . " Let 's go , " I said . Kite handed us our tickets . I stared at mine . " Chew , " he said . " Checks you out , sees if you 're clear for the experience , and you print up a pass on the back of your hand . " I inserted the ticket slowly and chewed . It tasted like the scent of a sun-warmed flower garden , with a tickle in the nose . I sneezed . The clerk smiled . " Have fun , " he said cheerfully . Circus Mind occupied the fifth and sixth floors of a twentieth-century skyscraper , the Empire State Building . I consulted my slate and learned that I was not far from Penn Station  --  in case I wanted to escape and my friends were locked in their amusements . Kite took my arm and Orianna ran interference with a group of LitVid arbeiters looking for society interest . Kite projected a confusion around me  --  multiple images , all false , as if four or five women accompanied him  --  and we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman over two and a half meters tall , her auburn hair brushing the star-patterned ceiling , checked our hands for passes and we entered the waiting area . " Next flight , five minutes , " a sepulchral voice announced . Cartoonish faces popped out of the walls , leering at us  --  lurid villains from a pop LitVid.  | " Abso brain neg , " Shrug commented . " I was hoping for a challenge . " " I 've been here twice , " said a woman with skin of flexible coppery plates . " It 's strong inside . " Orianna glanced at me , Okay ? I nodded , but I was not happy . Kite , I noticed , had assumed a blank air , neither expectant nor bored . After a five-minute wait , the faces on the walls looked sad and vanished , a door opened , and we entered a wide , open dance floor , already covered with patrons . Projectors in the ceiling and floor created a hall of mirrors . The floor controller decided Kite and I were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not see Shrug or Orianna or any of the other patrons , though I heard them faintly . Kite grinned at me . " Maybe this replaces murder , " he said . I had no idea what he meant . I felt more than a little apprehensive . But that , I decided  --  and I squared my shoulders to physically strengthen my resolve  --  was simple backwater fright . This was nothing more than a mental roller coaster . A slender golden man appeared on a stage a few steps away . " Friends , I need your help , " he said earnestly . " A million years from now , something will go drastically wrong , and the human race will be extinguished . What you do here and now can save the planet and the Solar System against forces too vast to precisely describe . Will you accompany me into the near future ? " " Sure , " Kite said , putting his hand on my shoulder . The golden man and the hall of mirrors vanished . We floated in starry space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare for transit . " Kite let go of my shoulder and took my hand . The stars zipped past in the expected way , and Earth rastered into view in front of us . Background information flooded into my head . In this future , all instrumentality is controlled by deep molecular Chakras , beings installed in every human at birth as guardians and teachers . Your first Chakra is a good friend , but there has been a malicious error  --  an evolvon has been loosed in the child-treatment centers . A malicious Chakra has invaded an entire generation . You have been isolated from your high birthright , cut loose of energy and nutrition . A generation lives in the midst of plenty , yet starves . You must now find a Natural Rebirth Clinic on an Earth filled with menace , eliminate all Chakras , find the roots of your new soul , and prevent those controlled by their Evil Masters from forcing the sun to go supernova . " Sounds pretty lame , " I whispered to Kite . " Wait a bit , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I wanted to . There were no cities , as such  --  expanses of wilderness covered the continents . This , I knew , was because I could not call forth my Chakra of instrumentality . Somewhere is your teacher , in the Natural Rebirth Clinic . You do not know what he or she or it looks like  --  it might even be a flower or a tree . But it contains your clue to regaining control . . . I could hardly have been more bored . I wanted to smile at Kite and reassure him , this was nothing , not even so bad as Orianna 's potboiler sim . Then my mind jerked . I filled with fear and deep loathing  --  for the evil Chakra , for loss of my birthright , for the impending end of everything . And mixed with the fear was a primal urge to join forces in every way possible  --  with Kite , with whoever might be present . Hack plot , to say the least , but I had never experienced such vivid washes of imposed emotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a keyboard . " I think I know what 's going to happen next , " Kite said . " Oh ? " Everyone on the Circus Mind floor appeared around us , floating in space . " It 's very drive , " Kite assured me . The golden man faded into view , in the center of our empyrean of several hundred souls . " At last , we have all arrived , and we have a suffi-ciency , " he said . " Teams must join and become families , and trust implicitly . Are we prepared ? " Everybody gave their assent , including me . I had been expertly pre-pared  --  my nerves sang with excitement and anticipation . " Let us join as families . " The golden man encircled groups of twenty with broad glowing red halos . Our clothes vanished . Transforms reshaped to their natural forms , or at least what the controller  --  a thinker , I presumed , with considerable resources  --  imagined their natural forms might be . Other than being naked , Kite and I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skydivers in freefall . " The first step , " the golden man said , " is to unite . And the best way to do that is to dance , to join your natural energies , your natural sexuali-ties . " It was an orgy . I had been prepared so well  --  and part of me truly did want to couple , especially with Kite  --  that I did not object . The controller played on our sexual instincts expertly , and this time the sex  --  unlike what I had experi- p 189 enced in Orianna 's sim  --  felt real . My body believed I was having sex , although a disclaimer  --  discreetly making itself known to my inner self ? informed me I was not actually having sex . The experience grew into something larger , all of our minds working together . The sim prompted us to move our bodies on the floor in a dance that echoed our emotions . While deeply involved in the alternate reality , we were at once aware of the dance , and of our own personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that did n't matter  --  I fit . The dance felt lovely . All of us pooled the resources of our assumed characters  --  looked down on the Earth , so fragile and threatened  --  and we loved it with an intensity I had never felt even for family , a dreamlike rush of awed emotion and dependency . I was ready to do anything , sacrifice anything , to save it . . . Throughout the entire experience , a distant tiny harbor of my individuality wondered idly if this was what Earth wished to do to Mars  --  use us . Join in a vast , insignificant orgy to save the future . This backwater self tapped its foot impatiently , and suspected the overblown love of Earth to be a kind of propaganda . . . But it was effective propaganda , and I enjoyed myself hugely . As the group sim drew to a conclusion , and our dance slowed  --  very tired . We had saved the future , saved the Earth and the sun , defeated the evil evolvon Chakras , and coincidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew their names , their individual characters , if not the intimate details of their daily lives . We smiled and laughed and hugged on the large floor . The lights rose and music played , abstract projections suggested by the music swirling around us . We had been through a lot together . I had no doubt that if I stayed on Earth long enough , I would be welcome in each of their homes , as if we had been lifelong friends , lovers , there was n't really an appropriate word ? more even than husbands and wives . Mates in group sim . Kite and I rejoined Shrug and Orianna on the street . Reality seemed pale and gray against what we had just experienced . A gentle drizzle softened the night air . Orianna seemed concerned . " Was that okay ? " she asked . " I thought too late it might be more than you wanted ... " " It was interesting , " I said . " They call them amity sims . They 're bright fresh , " Kite said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before  --  all proprietary tech , but I 'm sure there are some major thinkers involved . "  | Shrug looked dazed . His path along the street wavered , a step this way , a step the other . He grinned over his shoulder at us . " Touchy getting used to the real . " " That was really nice , " Kite said , putting an arm around me . " No jealousy , just friendship and affection  --  and no anxiety , until we met the bad Chakras . " I looked up at Kite . We had not been lovers  --  not physi-cally  --  but I felt extremely close to him , more than I had to Charles . That bothered me . " I do n't think I 've ever been so scared , " Shrug said . " Really social , " Orianna said . " Everybody knows everybody else . Could bond all of Earth if it maxes . " Indeed , I thought , it could . " I need to rest , " I said . " Get back to Wash-ington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day together , " Orianna said . " You 're a good partner , a good friend , and ? " I stopped her with a tight embrace . " Enough , " I said , smiling . " You 'll puncture my Martian reserve . " " Would n't want you to leak reserve , " Shrug said , standing apart , arms folded , fingers tapping elbows . " We 'll walk to Penn Station . You can track to DC from there . " We said little as we navigated the crowds and adwalls . The glow of Circus Mind faded . Orianna became sad and a little withdrawn . She turned to me as we neared the station . " I wanted to show you so much , Casseia . You have to know Earth . That 's your job now . " She spoke almost sternly . " Right , " I said . Already a deep sense of embarrassment had set in  --  a reaction to the unearned intimacy of the Circus , I presumed . Martian reserve leaking . " I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know , " I answered honestly . " If there is , I 'll call . " " Do , " she said . " Do n't let the sim shade what we 've earned . " Her use of that word , echoing my own thoughts , startled me . Orianna could be spookily intuitive . " Thank you , " Kite said , and kissed me . I held back on that kiss  --  Earth kissing Mars , not all that proper , perhaps , considering . I entered the station . They stayed outside , waving , farewells as old as time . Four hours later , I sat in my room overlooking Arlington , the combs , the Potomac , and the distant Mall . Bithras had left the suite . Allen had not p 191 returned from Nepal . Alice was deep in broadband net research for Bithras and I did not disturb her . I focused on the Washington Monument , like an ancient stone rocket ship , and tried to keep my head quiet so I could listen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth . We were in every way Earth 's inferior . Younger , more divided , our strength lay in our weakness ? in diversity of opinion , in foolish reserve that masqueraded as politeness , in the warmth and security of our enclosed spaces , our warrens . We were indeed rabbits . The fading sim had left a strong impression of Earth 's passionate embrace . The patriotism  --  planetism  --  felt here was ages old , more than a match for our youthful Martian brand . I shivered . Wolf Earth could gobble us in an instant . She needed no excuse but the urge . We received our invitations  --  instructions , actually  --  two days later . We would meet secretly with Senators Mendoza and Wang in neutral territory : Richmond , Virginia , away from the intense Beltway atmosphere . The choice of city seemed meaningful . Richmond had been capitol of the Confederacy during the American Civil War , over three centuries before : a genteel , well-preserved town of three million , for nearly ninety years a center for optimized human design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Allen asked as we gathered in the suite 's living room . A projection of the Richmond meeting place , the Thomas Jefferson Hotel , floated above the coffee table , severe gray stone and pseudo-Greek architecture . Bithras regarded us dourly , eyes weary . He had been up all evening communicating with Mars ; the travel time for each signal had been almost eight minutes , a total delay of almost sixteen minutes between sending and receiving a reply . He had not revealed any of the details of his conversations yet . " What messages ? " he asked . Allen nodded to me : you explain . " Richmond was once a symbol of the failed South , " I said . " South America ? " Bithras asked . " Southern states . They tried to secede from the Union . The North was immensely more powerful . The South suffered for generations after losing a civil war . " " Not a very clear message , " Bithras said . " I hope they have n't chosen Richmond just for that reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What have you heard from Mars ? "  | Bithras wrinkled his brow and shook his head . " The limits to my discretion are clear . If the deal we agreed to is inadequate . . . then we agree to nothing . We go home . " " After coming all this way ? " I asked . " My dear Casseia , the first rule of politics , as in medicine , is Do no harm . ' I do not want to act on my own initiative ; the Council tells me they will not tolerate any initiative ; so , there will be no initiative . " " Why summon us to Earth in the first place ? " I asked . " I do n't know , " Bithras said . " If I did n't suspect strongly otherwise , I would call it gross incompetence . But when your adversary 's incompetence puts you at a disadvantage , it is time to think again . " The Council will make some decisions and get back to me before we leave for Richmond . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give Alice a break and set up an appointment with Jill . " " We have a five-minute appointment at twenty-three this evening , broadband ex net , private and encrypted , " Allen said . " Alice and I made arrangements with Jill yesterday . . . just in case . " " I 'm glad somebody can show initiative , " Bithras said . I was as curious as anybody to find out what Alice and Jill would discuss . Jill was the oldest thinking being on Earth , a fabulous figure , the first thinker to achieve bona fide self-awareness , as defined by the Atkins test . Decades before Jill and Roger Atkins , Alan Turing had proposed the Turing test for equality between human and machine : if in a conversation limited to written communication , where the human could not directly view the correspondents , a person could not tell the difference between a machine and another human , then the machine was itself as intelligent as a human . This subtle and ingenious test neglected to take into account the limits of most humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many computers , especially the class of neural net machines becoming known as " thinkers , " were fooling a great many humans , even experts , in such conversations . Only one expert consistently pierced the veil to see the limited machines behind : Roger Atkins of Stanford Uni-versity . Jill outlived Atkins , and became the model for all thinkers built after . Now , even an exported thinker such as Alice could outstrip Jill several times over , but for one crucial quality . Jill had acquired much of her knowledge through experience . She was one hundred and twenty-eight years old . We paid for the broadband connection between Alice and Jill , agreed to the encryption algorithm , and went to bed . p 193 * * * Sleep on Earth , despite my bichemistry , almost invariably felt heavy . The strain of Earth 's pull on a Martian 's muscles and organs could not be eliminated ; it could only be treated . While I felt well enough awake , my sleeping self often drowned , dragged under shallow waters rushing in tides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed or rather glided up the internal spiral of a tower staircase when Bithras shook me rudely awake . I reflexively jerked the covers up , fearing the worst . He pulled his hands back , eyes wide , as if deeply hurt . " No nonsense , Casseia , " he said . " There is a serious problem . Alice woke me . She 's finished her conversation with Jill . " Allen , Bithras and I sat in our robes in the living room , cradling cups of hot tea . Alice 's image perched primly on the couch between Bithras and Allen , hands folded on her knees . She spoke with a calm , deliberate voice , describing her encounter with Jill . Allen quietly made notes on his slate . " The meeting was extraordinary , " Alice began . " Jill allowed me to become her for a time , and to store essential aspects of her experiences in my own memories . I provided her in turn with my own experiences . We divided our five minutes between conversation in deep-level thinker language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether bad syncline searches could occur in any of our neural systems . " " You allowed Jill to analyze your systems ? " Allen asked with some alarm , looking up from his slate . " Yes . " " Tell them what she found , " Bithras said . " This is in a sense proprietary , " Alice said . " Jill could face difficulties if her work is discovered . " " You have our promise of discretion , " Bithras said . " Casseia ? Allen ? " We swore secrecy . " Jill considers all thinkers to be part of her family . She feels responsible for us , like a mother . When thinkers converse with her , she analyzes us , adding to her own store of knowledge and experience , and determines whether we are functioning properly . " I detected reticence . Alice did not want to get to the point . " Tell us , Alice , " Bithras encouraged . " I still feel deeply embarrassed by what Jill discovered in me . I am able to fulfill my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to no longer trust my ultimate performance ? " Bithras shook his head impatiently . " Jill found evolvons , " he said .  | 94 " In Alice ? " Allen asked , lowering his slate . I sucked in my breath . " What kind ? " I asked . Alice 's image froze , flickered , and went out . Her voice remained . " I am changing modes of display to better conform with my internal state , " she said . " I will not maintain a cosmetic front . Evolvons exist in my personality configuration . They appear to be original , not implanted after my incept date . " An evolvon could be nearly any thing or system designed to exist in time , consume energy or memory , and reproduce itself . All living things were evolvons in a sense . Within computers and thinkers , the word usually referred to algorithms or routines not known to be part of the status design or acquired neural configuration  --  sophisticated viruses . " Do you know their purpose ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my neural bauplan , my self-known design , and running a trace of her own devising . There are parts of me that are not known to me , and which I have no control over ; these parts are not functional in my personality configuration . They have no known utility , but all of them contain reproductive algorithms . They are well-hidden . No traces on Mars revealed their presence . " " Evolvons , " Allen said , his face pale . " That 's against the law . " " I have difficulty describing my sensation at making this discovery , " Alice said . I wanted to hold her , but of course she had nothing to hold . Her voice remained level  --  I had never heard a thinker express negative emotions in speech . But her tone became a shade harsher as she said , " I feel violated . " " Is it possible the evolvons have been planted since we left Mars or arrived on Earth ? " Bithras asked . " Very unlikely . I have not been accessed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could be planted after my incept date . " Bithras folded his hands on his knee . " If you have these .. . evolvons , then Alice One has them as well . " " Most likely , " Alice said . " They were copied from her to you . And they escaped our most expert traces . That means they were planted by the manufacturer , right here on Earth . " The implications were jolting . " I apologize for my inability to be trustworthy , " Alice said . " No need to apologize , " Bithras said . " We 'll remove the evolvons ? " " Jill does not believe that can be done without great care to avoid damaging my personality . They are imbedded in key routines . " p 195 " Do you know what will activate them ? " I asked . " No , " Alice said . " Can you guess ? " I pursued . " Specific triggering codes delivered by any of my inputs , " Alice said . " They are sabotage , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's responsible ? " I asked . " Earth , " he said , lips curling . " Sane , wonderful Earth . " Bithras sent an emergency message to Mars , contents unknown to us , and returned to his bed , exhausted , soon after . Allen and I stayed up , ordered a bottle of wine , and sat drinking , talking with Alice . " The most important thing , " I said , finishing the first glass , " is whether Alice wants to continue working with us . " " Bithras and I have discussed this , " Alice said . Allen and I felt tired and sad and discouraged , as if suffering through an illness in the family . What was dying rapidly was any joy we might have had , coming to Earth ; any feeling of value as representatives of Mars , any sense of self-worth whatsoever . We were isolated , our friend was compromised in such a way that we could no longer have faith in her " What did Bithras say ? " I asked softly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will of course be glad to continue . " " Can you tell . . . ? " Allen asked , not finishing . " I will not know when or if when an evolvon is activated . This I have told Bithras . " " Everything we set out to do is being scuttled , " Allen said , twirling his glass in his hand . " We ca n't trust anybody or anything here . " " They 're frightened , " I blurted . I had not mentioned my conversation with President Muir ; I had not wanted to leave any impression that I was trying to conduct diplomatic inquiries on my own . And the conversation itself had not made much sense to me , had no context , until now . " They 're afraid of what we can do . " " What can they possibly be afraid of ? " Allen asked . " I do n't know , " I said . " I ca n't figure it out . " I described my visit to the Omphalos . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alice , " he said , " does any of this make sense to you ? " " If I model the situation correctly , we are in the middle of changing political strategies , " she said . " Earth obviously prepared decades ago for unexpected situations by placing evolvons in thinkers shipped to Mars . "  | " Perhaps all thinkers , " I said . " Maybe that 's why Jill analyzed you .. . She suspects something , and she does n't approve . " Abruptly , the image of Alice Liddell appeared , sitting beside Allen on the couch . He jumped . " Sorry , " she said . " I did not mean to startle you . " " What could possibly have changed their strategy ? " I asked . " Bithras received a communication from Cailetet , a copy of a text message from Stanford University sent to the Olympian research group on Mars , " Alice said . " He discussed it with Casseia . " Alice projected the message for us . We 've established strong link between time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Third tweak discovered may be co-active but purpose unknown . Tweak time , tweak space , third tweak changes automatically . Probably derive general relat as regards curvature , but third tweak pushes a fourth tweak , weakly and sporadically . . . Derive conservation of destiny ? Fifty tweaks discovered so far . More to come . Can you share your discoveries ? Mutual bennies if yes . " Still sounds like gibberish , " I said . " There have been no further messages from Cailetet , " Alice said . " They 're stonewalling on the unification proposals , and they 've rejected Majumdar 's offers to join in the Olympians ' physics research . " " That 's new , " I said . " Bithras has n't told us about that . " " Bithras keeps many worries to himself . " " Does the message mean anything to you ? " Allen asked Alice . " Bell Continuum theory treats the universe as an informational array , a computational system . The Olympians applied for grants with abstracts on such theory . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they established communications with the group that sent this message . " Alice projected LitVid reports on related topics from the past year . The Stanford group had published only three public papers in the past ten years , none of them dealing with the Bell Continuum . Alice concluded the display by saying , Bithras has been unable to rent key papers and research vids related to the Bell Continuum , and has found only popular references to the topic of descriptor theory . ' " " Why did n't Bithras tell us ? " I asked . " I believe he did not think it was terribly important . But your visit with President Muir would interest him . Her instincts appear sound . " " Something 's going on ? " Allen asked . " Perhaps , " Alice said .  | " Something big enough to make Earth change course and reject our proposal ? " " It seems possible , " Alice said . " Casseia , in the morning , you should tell Bithras about your meeting with the ex-President . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee table and my empty glass of wine . " I believe he will ask you to speak with Charles Franklin . " I shook my head , but said , " If he asks . " I told Bithras about my meeting with Muir , and about our suspicions . He asked . I took a walk alone on the banks of the Potomac in the hour before dawn . The air brushed clear and cool against my bare arms . The sky above the river sparkled a starry , dusty blue . Combs to the south and east shaded the river even after dawn colored the sky deep teal and edged the few wisps of cloud with orange . I walked along the damp stone path , enjoying the mingled scents of honeysuckle and jasmine , giant roses and thick-leafed designer magnolia bushes , blooming in the hectares of gardens beneath the combs . Arcs of steel and mesh guided bougainvillea over the walkway , creating tunnels of deeper shade lighted at foot level by thin glowing ribbons twined around stone pillars . Artificial sun slowly brightened the gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servicing the huge flowers . The last thing I wanted was to intrude on Charles , ask him questions he would not want to answer , be indebted to him . We had caused each other enough distress in our short time together . Besides , what questions would I ask ? I had studied physics texts and vids in the past few sleepless hours . There was mention of the Bell Continuum and the universe as a computational system  --  mostly in the context of evolution of constants and particles in the early stages of the big bang . I knew enough about academics to pick up the general impression that these theories were not highly favored . Was Charles 's group of Olympians ( what an arrogant name ! ) alarming politicians on Earth with talk , or had Earth discovered something it did n't want Mars to know ? I sat on a warmed stone bench , face in hands , rubbing my temples with my index fingers . I had already composed my message to Charles : pure text , formal , as if we had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into serious problems here on Earth that may have something to do with your work . I realize you are contracted to Cailetet , and I presume there is some friction with other BMs , which also puzzles me ; but is there anything you can tell us that might explain why Earth would be deeply concerned with Martian independence ? We are getting nowhere in our own work , and there are clues that the Olympians are in part responsible . I am very embarrassed even asking you to say anything . Please do n't think I wish to intrude or cause trouble . Sincerely , Casseia Majumdar Washington DC USWH Earth ( trunk credit for reply open ) I judged that relations between Cailetet and Majumdar had somehow soured , perhaps on the matter of the Olympians . . . ( Poor Stan ! He would be lawbonded within a few weeks to a woman from Cailetet . We were all mired . ) In the Potomac , water welled up in glistening hills and ripples and a line of caretaker manatees broke the surface , resting from pruning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were dozens of other pedestrians on the walkway now . The roses in the gardens sang softly , attracting tiny sound bees in tight-packed silver clouds . I sent the message . Allen and I attended a concert in Georgetown . I barely heard the music , Brahms and Hansen played on original instruments , lovely but distant to my thoughts and mood . My slate was set to receive any possible reply . None came until the morning we left for Richmond . Dear Casseia , There is nothing I can say about my work . I appreciate your position . It will not get any easier . Luck , Charles Franklin Isidis Planitia Mars ( trunk credit not used ) p 199 I showed the message to Allen and Bithras , and then to Alice . Charles had said little , revealed nothing , but had confirmed all we really needed to know , that the pressures would grow worse , and that the Olympians were involved . " Time to exert my own pressure , " Bithras said . " The whole Solar System is shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . " I wondered if Charles had made his connection with a QL thinker yet . A thick rain fell in Richmond . Our plane descended on its pad with a soft sigh . Thick white billows wrapped its long oval form like a paramecium engulfed by an amoeba . Portions of the billows quickly hardened to form passenger tunnels . Arbeiters crawled along ramps within the foam . Behind the passengers , a wall of foam absorbed the seats row by row , cleaning and repairing . My uncle made a few smiling and cordial comments to a small scatter of LitVid journalists in the transfer area . There were fewer people and more arbeiters among them ; the number of journalists attending our every move had dropped by two-thirds since our arrival . We were no longer either very interesting or very important . A private charter cab took us from the transfer area through Richmond . As a courtesy , we were driven down a cobbled street between rows of houses dating back to the 1890s , past a war monument to a general named Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War . As in Washington , the civic center was free of combs and skyscrapers . We might have returned to the late nineteenth century . The Jefferson Hotel appeared old but well-maintained . Architectural nano busily replaced stone and concrete on the south side as we entered the main doors . The rain stopped and sun played gloriously through the windows of our suite as we hooked Alice into the ex nets and ate a quick lunch , served by an attentive human waiter . I took an old-fashioned shower in the small antique bathroom , put on my suit , checked my medical kit for immunization updates  --  each city had new varieties of infectious learning to deal with  --  and joined Allen and Bithras in the hall outside the room . An arbeiter sent by Wang and Mendoza guided us to a conference room in the basement . There , surrounded by windowless walls of molded plaster , seated at antique wood tables , we once again shook hands with the senators . Wang graciously pulled out my chair . " Every time I come down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .  | " They would n't have let you into the Confederacy , " Mendoza commented dryly . " Nor you , " Wang said . Bithras showed no amusement , not even a polite smile . " It 's getting harder and harder to even find a good accent in America now , " Mendoza said . " Go down to the Old Capital , " Wang said , sitting at the opposite end of the thick dark wood table . " They have fine accents . " " Language is as homogenized as beauty , " Mendoza said , with an air of disapproval . " That 's why we find Martian accents refreshing . " I could not tell whether the condescension was deliberate or merely clumsy . I could hardly believe these two men did anything without calculation . If the smugness was deliberate , what were we being set up for ? " We apologize for the inconvenience , " Wang said . " Congress rarely cancels such important meetings . Never in my memory , in fact . " " We are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sure you 've guessed we 're not inviting you here in our capacity as representatives of the U.S. government . Not strictly speaking , " Mendoza said . Bithras folded his hands on the table . " What we have to say is neither polite , diplomatic , nor particularly subtle , " Mendoza continued , his own face hardening . " Such words should be reserved for private meetings , not meetings which eventually go into public record . " " Are we constrained from discussing this meeting with our citizens ? " Bithras asked . " That 's up to you , " Mendoza said , leveling his gaze on Bithras . " You may decide not to . We are issuing what amounts to a threat . " Bithras 's eyes grew large , seemed to protrude slightly , and his face turned a brownish-olive where his jaw muscles clenched tight . " I do not appreciate your attitude . You are speaking for GEWA ? " " Right , " Wang said . " But not strictly to you , Mr. Majumdar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , considering ? " Bithras rose from his chair . " Sit down , please , " Wang said , eyes cold , face angelically calm . Bithras did not sit . Wang shrugged , then nodded to Mendoza . Mendoza removed a small pocket slate and motioned for me to hand him mine . I did , and he transferred documents . " You 'll send these back to Mars as soon as possible . You 'll discuss them with your BM Council or any other responsible body that might exist at that time , and your appointed group will respond to the Seattle , p 201 Kyoto , Karachi , or Beijing offices of GEWA . We require a definitive answer within ninety days . " " We wo n't respond to pressure , " Bithras said , the effort at self-control obvious . Mendoza and Wang were not impressed . I handed Bithras my slate . He quickly scrolled through the first documents . " What I ca n't understand is how two Terrie politicians who pride themselves on civility and sophistication can act like petty thugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew up the corners of his mouth in a humored grimace . " The Solar System must be unified under a single authority within five years . The best and most balanced authority would be Earth 's . We must have agreement with the belts and Mars . GEWA , GSHA , and Eurocon are all agreed on this . " " I have a solid proposal , " Bithras said , " if only it will be heard by the right people . " " New arrangements must be made , " Mendoza said . " GEWA will negotiate with duly appointed and elected representatives of a united Mars . For several reasons , you are not acceptable . " " I arrive to negotiate and testify before the Congress of the United States  --  I am treated badly there ? " " You do not have the faith of the forces at odds with each other on Mars . Cailetet and other BMs have indicated through back-channels that they will not support your proposal . " " Cailetet , " I said , glancing at Bithras . Bithras shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We can deal with them , " Bithras said . " Cailetet currently relies on Majumdar for financing of many of their Martian projects . " Mendoza frowned with distaste at the implied threat . " That 's not all , and it 's probably not even the most important problem . In a few days , you 'll be defending yourself in a civil suit against a charge of improper sexual advances . The charges will be filed in the District of Columbia . I do n't think you 'll be effective as a negotiator once those charges are made public . " Bithras 's expression froze . " I beg your pardon , " he said , voice flat . " Please study the documents , " Mendoza said . " There are plans for unification acceptable to Earth , and suggestions for tactics to implement those plans . Your influence on Mars is not at issue . . . yet . There 's still much you can do there . Our time is up , Mr. Majumdar . " Wang and Mendoza nodded to Allen and myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were alone in the meeting room , Bithras lowered himself slowly , cautiously into his chair and stared at the wall .  | Allen spoke first . " What is this ? " he asked , facing Bithras across the table . " I do n't know , " Bithras said . " A lie . " " You must have a clue , " Allen pressed . " Obviously , it 's not just a sham . " " There was an incident , " Bithras said , closing his eyes , cheeks drawing up , making deep crow 's feet in the corners of his face . " It was not serious . I approached a woman . " I could not imagine anything Bithras could do that would bring a civil suit on the very open planet Earth . " She is the daughter of a Memon family , very highly placed , a representative from GEWA in Pakistan . I felt a kinship . I felt very warmly toward her . " " What happened ? " " I approached her . She turned me down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bithras said . He coughed and shook his head . " She is Islam Fatima . Married . It may have been a special insult . I am not Muslim . That may be it . " Allen turned to me . I did n't know whether he was going to cry or burst into sudden laughter . He took a deep breath , bit his lower lip , and turned away . A flush of extraordinary anger rose from my neck to my face . I stood , fists hanging at my sides . I lay on the bed in my room , sleepless . Through the door I heard Allen and Bithras shouting . Allen demanded details , Bithras said they were of no importance . Allen insisted they bloody well were important . Bithras began to weep . The shouting subsided and I heard only a low murmur that seemed to go on for hours . Sometime early in the morning , I woke and sat on the edge of the bed . I seemed to be nowhere , nobody . The furnishings in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The weight that held me to bed and floor seemed , by an extraordinary synesthesia , political and not physical . Through the translucent blinds on the broad window , I saw gray dawn pick out billows in the carpet of clouds that obscured the river , the tidal basin , everything , washing around the base of the comb . A message light blinked on my slate . I reached for it automatically , then drew back . I did not wish to speak with Orianna or read a letter from my parents . It might be days before I silenced the static in my head . p 203 Finally , I acknowledged my inability to let a message go unread . I picked up the slate and scrolled . It was not from Orianna or my parents . It was from Senator John Mendoza . He wanted to speak with me alone and in the open , and he did not want me to tell anyone we were meeting . After a suitable interval , the message blanked , leaving only his office number for a reply . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an antique vending cart near the Lincoln Memorial . As I approached a marble bench by the reflecting pool , where Mendoza had agreed to meet , I saw he also had a bag lunch . I sat beside him and he greeted me with a cordial smile . " Sometimes , " he said , " I imagine what it must have been like in government before dataflow , back when there were newspapers printed on paper . . . and maybe television and radio . Things were a lot simpler then . Do you know I am the only senator on the Hill who has no en-hancements ? " His smile broadened . " I have a good staff , good , dedicated people . Some of them have enhancements . So I 'm a hypocrite . " I said nothing . " Miss Majumdar , what happened in Richmond deeply embarrasses me . " " Why did we meet in Richmond ? " I blurted . " Because it was the capitol of the Confederacy ? " He seemed puzzled for a moment , then shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We wished to get you away from Washington , because what Wang and I had to say did n't really come from the U.S. govern-ment . " " It came from GEWA . " " Of course . " " You set up my uncle and destroyed his mission . We were easy marks for you , were n't we ? " " Please , " Mendoza said , lifting his hand . " We did nothing to your uncle . He failed all of us  --  Earth as well as Mars . What happened was inevitable  --  but I regret it . Your team simply does n't have GEWA 's confidence . Your uncle 's collision with the Pakistani woman . . . It was nothing we expected or desired . And we ca n't fix it  --  Pakistan is only a marginal member of GEWA . She was a diplomat 's wife , Miss Majumdar . Your uncle touched her . We 'll be lucky to settle the case in a few weeks and get your uncle back to Mars . "  | " Why talk with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand splayed on the bench , as if about to relate some intimacy . " Like me , you have no enhancements and you have n't gone through the secular purification of therapy . You 're old-fashioned . I can sympathize with you . I 've read your lit papers and student theses . I sense strongly that you belong to the next generation of leadership on Mars . " " I do n't think I 'll ever get involved with politics again , " I said . " Nonsense , " Mendoza said with a flash of anger . " Mars ca n't afford to lose people like you . And it can not afford to rely on people like your uncle . " I grimaced . " Do you realize how important the next few years are going to be ? " Mendoza asked . I did not answer . " I do n't know half what I 'd like to know , " Mendoza said . " You may eventually know more than I do . You can be at the center of one of the nodes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll always be on the periphery , a messenger boy . But I do know this : people above me are terrified . I 've never seen such confusion and disagreement  --  even the thinkers disagree . Do you see how extraordinary that is ? " I stared at him , the static gone . " Something frightfully powerful is going to be unleashed . Science does that to us every few generations  --  drops something in our laps we 're simply not prepared for . You 'd think today we 'd be prepared for almost anything . Well , at least the folks and thinkers on top see clearly enough that we have to get our house in order , and they 'd like to do it before the Big One drops  --  whatever it might be . " The deep realization of what had until now been gamesmanship and speculation made my stomach churn . " If our house is not in order , and there is a chance of some immature and youthful group of humans discovering and using this new power ? whatever it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokyo and Beijing , believe there is a chance we will destroy ourselves . " Mendoza frowned deeply , as if just informed one of his children was very ill . " You know , I 've been an outcast of sorts in Washington for a decade . I 'm a Mormon , I 'm not therapied . But I 've managed to do well . If anybody found out about my talking to you , I could lose everything I 've fought for , all status , all power , all influence . " " Why do it , then ? " I asked . p 205 " Did you know it 's illegal to conduct surveillance  --  even citizen over-sight  --  within the capital of any nation on Earth ? " I had heard that . " Some things in government must be done in private . Even in this ultra-rational age , when everybody is educated and plebiscites are huge and immediate , there must be times when the rules are not followed . " " The Peterson non-absolute , " I said . Peterson  --  icon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system aspiring to total organization and rationalism must leave itself an opportunity to break rules , break protocol , or it will inevitably suffer catastrophic failure . " Exactly . Go home , Miss Majumdar . Choose your mentors and your leaders carefully . Work for unity . However Mars comes into the fold , come in it must . I have studied enough history to see the terrain ahead . The slopes are very steep , the attractors are strong , the solutions very fast  --  and none of them are pleasant . " " I 'm just an assistant , " I repeated pathetically . He looked away , expression grim . " Then find someone who has the strength to become a pilot and guide you through the storm . " He pulled back and adjusted his lapels , picked up his lunch bag , and stood . " Goodbye , Miss Majumdar . " " Good-bye , " I said . " Thank you for your confidence . " Mendoza shrugged and walked across the grass and east toward the Capitol building . I sat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold inside as the curve of marble beneath my fingers . A month later , Bithras , Allen , and I packed for our return to Mars . The packing itself took little time . I had not seen Bithras for several days  --  he spent most of his time locked in long-distance communications with Mars , but I think also in deliberate isolation from us . Allen no longer treated Bithras with the respect due an elder statesman . It cost him dearly to show any respect at all toward our syndic . Bithras did not want to push me into a similar confrontation and be faced with my presumed negative judgment . But I did not hate him . I barely felt enough to pity him . I simply wanted to go home . Two days before our departure , Bithras came into the suite 's living room and stood over me as I sat in a chair , studying my slate . " The suit against me has been dropped . Cultural differences pleaded . The ruckus is over , " he said . " That part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good , " I said .  | " I 've filed suit on Alice 's behalf , " he said . " Majumdar BM seeks a judgment against Mind Design Incorporated of Sorrento Valley , Califor-nia . " I nodded . He swallowed , staring out the window , and continued as if it were an effort to talk . " I 've consulted with Alice One and Alice Two , and with our advocates on Mars , and I 'm hiring an advocate here . We 're seeking a jury trial , with a minimum of two thinkers impaneled on the fury . " That 's smart , " I said . Bithras sat in the chair opposite and folded his hands in his lap . " All of this has been done in confidence , but before we leave , I am going to release the details . That will force Mind Design to take the case to court rather than settle in secret . It will be scandalous . They will deny all . " " Probably , " I agreed . " It will be very bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicions that Earth is involved in a conspiracy , using Mind Design , to cripple Mars economically . " Bithras sighed deeply . " I have made mistakes . It is only small relief to believe they have done worse . Alice Two will stay here . " " Good plan , " I said . " Someone should stay with her . Allen has volunteered , but I thought to offer the chance to you . " " I should leave Earth , " I said without hesitation . " We have both had enough of Earth , " Bithras said . Then , dropping his gaze , " You think I 'm a fool . " My lips worked and my eyes filled with tears of anger and betrayal . " Y-yes , " I answered , looking away . " I am not the best Mars has to offer . " " I hope to God not , " I said . " I have given you opportunities , however , " he said . I refused to meet his eyes . " Yes , " I agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council will conduct hearings . You will be asked embarrassing questions . " " That is n't what makes me so angry , " I said . " Then what ? " " A man with your responsibilities , " I said . " You should have known . About your problems and the trouble they might cause . " " What , and have myself therapied ? " He laughed bitterly . " How Terrestrial ! How fitting a Martian should suggest that to me . " " It happens on Mars all the time , " I said . p 207 " Not to a man of my heritage , " he said . " We are as we are born , and we play those cards , and none other . " " Then we 'll lose , " I said . " Perhaps , " he said . " But honorably . " I said my farewells to Alice in the suite an hour before we left for the spaceport . For a time , Alice had withdrawn , refusing to answer our questions about her contamination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our lawsuit , or his own thinker . But that changed , and she seemed to accept her new status  --  a beloved member of the family who could not be employed as she had once been . " I have been replaying parts of the sim you shared with Orianna , " she told me as she tracked on her carriage into my room . My suitcase and slate lay on the field bed , squared with the corners . I am sometimes excessively neat . " You kept all of it ? " I asked . " Yes . I have observed fragments of created personalities undergoing portions of the sim . It has been interesting . " " Orianna thought you might find it useful , " I said . " But you should delete it before the Mind Design thinkers check you over . " " I can delete nothing , I can only condense and store inactively . " " Right . I forgot . " Suddenly , Alice laughed in a way I had not heard before . " Yes . Like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to miss you , " I said . " The trip home will seem much longer without you . " " You will have Bithras for company , and fellow passengers to meet . " " I doubt that Bithras and I will talk much , " I said , shaking my head . " Do not judge Bithras too harshly . " " He 's done a lot of harm . " " Is it not likely that the harm was prepared for him to do ? " I could n't take her meaning . " People and organizations on Earth behave in subtle ways . " " You think Bithras was set up ? " " I believe Earth will not be happy until it has its way . We are obsta-cles . " I looked at her with fresh respect . " You 're a little bitter yourself , are n't you ? " I asked . And no longer very naive . " Call it that , yes . I look forward to joining with my original , " Alice said . " I think we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what humans do . "  | Alice displayed her image for the first time in weeks , and young , longhaired Alice Liddell smiled . We returned to Mars . News of the suit on behalf of Alice followed us . It did indeed make a ripple overshadowing Bithras 's indiscretions . The scandal caused GEWA considerable embarrassment and may have contributed to a general cooling of the nascent confrontation between Earth and Mars . The suit , however , was quickly swamped in drifts of prevarication and delay . By the time we arrived home  --  the only home I would ever have ? ten months later , there still had been no decision . Nothing had changed for the better . Nothing had changed at all .  | 2178-2181 , M.Y . 57-58 I would Love you ten years before the Flood , And you should , if you please , refuse Till the conversion of the Jews .

Andrew Marvell , " To His Coy Mistress " AFTER A MARTIAN YEAR AWAY FROM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my apprenticeship , a furor at Majumdar , and Bithras 's resignation . The Majumdar suit against Mind Design Incorporated did indeed turn into a scandal , but it was n't enough to save my third uncle from disgrace . Mind Design passed blame to the Intra-Earth Computer Safety Bureau , which they said was responsible for injecting certain obscure safeguards into neural net designs . The suit dragged on for years and satisfied nobody , but it spurred fresh interest in Martiangrown thinkers . Martian thinker designers  --  the best Mars had to offer at the time ? claimed they could deactivate the evolvons . Mars would be safe from Terrie " eavesdropping . " Alice was soon cleansed and redeemed , and that pleased me . The concern faded . It should n't have . One benefit of the scandal was that we heard no more about Mars 's  | threat to Earth 's security . Indeed , a good many Terrie pressures on Mars subsided . But the scandal was not the sole reason . Earth for a time seemed content with a few stopgaps . Cailetet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could draw our own conclusions . Stan , lawbonded and transferred to Jane 's BM , did not know what Cailetet had done , or what agreements had been reached  --  and I would not ask Charles , who ostensibly still worked for Cailetet . My letter to him requesting information still embarrassed me . Father told me that Triple dollars smelling of Earth were flooding steadily into Cailetet , but not to the Olympians . Funding for the requested QL thinkers had never gone through . Cailetet continued to refuse Majumdar BM 's offer to join the project . Cailetet revealed little , except to say that the Olympians had been working on improved communications ; nothing terribly strategic . And they had failed , losing their funding . My mother died in a pressure failure at Jiddah . Even now , writing that , I shrink ; losing a parent is perhaps the most final declaration of lone responsibility . Losing my mother , however , was an uprooting , a tearing of all my connections . My father 's grief , silent and private , consumed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new man who inhabited my father 's body . I thought perhaps we would become closer , but that did not happen . Visiting him was not easy . He saw my mother in me . My visits , those first few months , hurt too much for him to bear . Like most Martians , he refused grief therapy and so did Stan and I. Our pain was tribute to the dead . I had to make my own plans , find my own life , rebuild in the time left to my youth . I was thirteen Martian years old and could find only the most mundane employment at Majumdar , or work for my father at Ylla , which I did not want to do . It was time to seek alliances elsewhere . My vegetable love grew and blossomed in the Martian spring . The best fossil finds on Mars had been discovered while I traveled to and from Earth . In the Lycus and Cyane Sulci , spread across a broad band north of the old shield volcano Olympus Mons , canyons twist and shove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of huge and restless worms . The Mother Ecos once flourished here , surviving for tens of millions of years while the rest of Mars died . p 211 One of the chief diggers was Kiqui Jordan-Erzul . He had an assistant named Ilya Rabinovitch . I met Ilya at a BM Grange in Rubicon City , below Alba Patera . He had just finished excavating his twelfth mother cyst . I had heard of his work . The Grange was uniquely Martian . Held at a different station in each district every quarter , Granges combined courting , dancing , lectures and presentations , and BM business in a holiday atmosphere . BMs could swap informal clues about Triple business , negotiate and strike deals without pressure , and prospect for new family members . Ilya delivered a vivid report on his fossil finds at Cyane Sulci . Memories of my visit with Charles to the sites near Tres Haut Medoc drew me into conversation with Ilya after his talk . He was small  --  a centimeter shorter than me  --  beautifully made , with dark and lively eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sean Dickinson , but his personality could not have been more opposite . He loved dancing , and he loved talking publicly and privately about ancient Mars . During a lull between an exhausting series of Patera reels , he sat with me in a tea lounge under a projected night sky and described the Mother Ecos in loving detail , pouring intimate descriptions of the ancient landscape into my sympathetic ear , as if he had lived in those times . " To dig is to marry Mars , " he said , expecting either a blank stare or a move to another part of the lounge . Instead , I asked him to tell me more . After the dances , we spent a few hours walking alone around a wellhead reservoir . With little warning other than a slow approach and a warning smile , he kissed me and told me he had an irrational attraction . I had heard similar lines before , but coming from Ilya , the technique seemed fresh . " Oh , " I said , noncommittal , but smiling encouragement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . Then he winced and glanced at me with his head turned half aside . " Does that sound stupid ? " " Maybe we were Martians once , " I suggested lightly . I 've always been intrigued by the beginning of a courtship , curiously detached and relaxed , wondering how far the mating dance could possibly go . I had given my signals ; I was receptive , and the work was now up to him . " Maybe we knew each other a billion years ago . " He laughed , drew back , and stretched , and we listened to the liquid tones of falling and circulating waters . Arbeiters ignored us , rolling along their ramps checking flow and purity . Ilya seemed as relaxed as I was , immensely self-assured without appearing arrogant . " You went to Earth a couple of years ago , did n't you ? "  | " Just over a year ago , " I said . " Earth years , I meant . " He was involved with fossils ; he used Earth years instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeating itself . " Yes . " " What was it like ? " " Intense , " I said . " I 'd love to be involved in an Earth dig . They 're still finding major fossils in China and Australia . " " I do n't think I 'll go back for a while , " I said . " You did n't enjoy yourself , did you ? " " Parts of it were lovely , " I said . " Disappointed in love ? " he asked . I laughed . His smile thinned ; like most men , he did n't enjoy being laughed at . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " Disappointed by politics . " His smile returned . " Babe in the woods ? " " Embryo in the savage jungle , " I said ruefully . The next day , the third day of the Grange , we met again , gravitating with delicious half-conscious intent . He bought me lunch and we walked through glass tubes on the Up , looking across Rubicon Valley . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , with a persistent ache that had me close to tears ? tears of old pain and relief at finally speaking  --  I told someone in detail how I personally felt about Earth and what had happened there . I told about feeling betrayed and ignorant and powerless , about Earth 's overwhelming culture . We finished our lunch and checked into a private space , nothing said , nothing suggested ; Ilya led me . I talked some more , and then I leaned on him and he put an arm around my shoulders . " They treated you pretty shabbily , " he said . " You deserve better . " Of course , that was what I wanted to hear ; but he meant it with utmost sincerity . And gauging what I was prepared for , and not prepared for , he did not press his suit too strongly . I had rented guest lodgings at Rubicon City for the duration of the Grange . He suggested I stay afterward with his family , Erzul BM , at Olympus Station . I did n't have time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jiddah to work on a Majumdar project report . But I promised we 'd get together soon . I was n't about to let this relationship lapse . My feelings toward Ilya began simply and directly . He was the sweetest , most intuitive , and most straightforward man I had ever met . I wanted to continue talking with him for hours , days , months , and much longer . Making love seemed a p 213 natural extension of talking things through ; lying naked together , warmed by our exertion , limbs casually locked , giggling at jokes , aghast at the state of the BMs and the Council that bowed low before Earth .. . When I was with him , I felt an extraordinary peace and wholeness . Here was someone who could help me sort things out . Here was a part-ner . Erzul 's Olympus Station felt very different from Ylla , or any other station I had visited on Mars . Erzul BM had begun in 2130 as a joint venture between poor American Hispanic , Hispaniolan , and Asian families on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had eventually drawn in Polynesians and Filipinos . When they arrived on Mars , they occupied a ready-built trench dome in the western shadow of the Olympus Rupes . Within five Martian years , they had established liaisons with seven other BMs , including the ethnic-Russian Rabinovitch . Erzul had quickly prospered . A small , prosperous mining and soil engineering BM , respected and unaligned , Erzul had kept all of its contracts on Mars . Now , with ninety mining claims in four districts , they were still small , but efficient and well-regarded , known for their trustworthiness and friendly dealings . When I arrived at Olympus Station , I checked in to a guest room  --  Ilya gave me this much freedom , a way out if I did n't get along with his family ? and toured the BM museum , a boring collection of old drilling and digging equipment enlivened by large murals of Polynesian and Hispaniolan myth . He left me before a portrait of Pele , Little Mother of Volcanoes , a passionate and bitchy-looking female of considerable beauty , and returned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller than Ilya and twice as broad . " Casseia , I 'd like you to meet our syndic , Ti Sandra . " Ti Sandra looked me over with a little frown , lower lip poked out . An impressively large woman , two meters high and big-boned , with an enormous smile , deep-set warm eyes and a soft-spoken alto voice , Ti Sandra Erzul carried herself with stately bearing . Very dark , thick black hair in a halo around her head , a firmly friendly face with prominent and assertive features , she might have been a warrior queen in a fantasy sim ... But her easy manner , her girlish pride in bright clothes , dissipated whatever threat her physical presence might have implied . " Are you a banker ? " she asked . I laughed . " No , " I said . " Good . I do n't think Ilya would get along with a banker . He 'd always  | be asking for research money . " She smiled sunnily , her deep warm eyes crinkling almost shut , and pulled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread her large , strong arms wide and said , " You are always welcome . You have such a lovely name , and Ilya is a good judge . He is like my son , except that we are not too far apart in age  --  five years , you know ! " We ate a huge dinner in the syndic 's quarters that evening , joined by twenty family members , and I met Ti Sandra 's husband , Paul Crossley , a quiet , thoughtful man ten years older than Ti Sandra . Paul stood no taller than Ilya . Ti Sandra towered over her husband , but only in size . They flirted like newlyweds . The gathering 's lively informality charmed me . They chatted in Spanish , French , Creole , Russian , Tagalog , Hawaiian , and for my benefit , English . Their curiosity about me was boundless . " Why do n't you speak Hindi ? " Kiqui Jordan-Erzul asked . " I never learned , " I said . " My family speaks English ... " " All of them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mother and father spoke only English when I was young . " " English is a cramped language . You should speak Creole . All music . " " Not much good for science , " Ilya said . " Russian 's best for science . " Kiqui snorted . Another " digger , " Oleg Schovinski , said he thought German might be best for science . " German ! " Kiqui snorted again . " Good for metaphysics . Not the best for science . " " What kind of tea do you brew in Ylla ? " asked Kiqui 's wife , Therese . Ti Sandra was much loved in Erzul . Young and old looked on her as matriarch , even though she was less than twenty Martian years old . After dinner , she carried a huge bowl of fresh fruit around the table , offering everybody dessert , then stood before the group . " All right now , all of you put down your beers and listen . " " Lawbond ! Lawbond ! " several chanted . " You be quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring you a friend of Ilya 's . You 've talked with her , impressed her with our savoirfaire , and she 's impressed me , and I 'm very pleased to say that she is going to marry our little **27;0;TOOLONG . " Ilya 's face reddened with embarrassment . Ti Sandra held up her hands above the raucous cheering . " She 's from Majumdar but she is n't a banker , so you be good to her and do n't ask for more loans . " p 215 More cheers . " Her name is Casseia . Stand up , Cassie . " I stood and it was my turn to blush . The cheers nearly brought down the insulation . Kiqui toasted our health and asked if I was interested in fossils . " I love them , " I said , and that was true ; I loved them because of their connection to Ilya . " That 's good , because Ilya ' s the only man I know who gets depressed when he has n't dug for a week , " Kiqui said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has n't decided what arrangements to make , but we 'll be happy either way , " Ti Sandra said . " We 've decided , actually , " Ilya said . " What ? " the crowd asked as one . " I 've offered to transfer to Majumdar , " Ilya said . " Very good , " Ti Sandra said , but her expression betrayed her . " But Casseia tells me she 's ready for a change . She 's transferring to Erzul . " " If you 'll have me , " I added . More cheers . Ti Sandra embraced me again . A hug from her was like being folded in the arms of a large , soft tree with a core of iron . " Another daughter , " she said . " That 's lovely ! " They crowded around Ilya and me , offering congratulations . Aunts , uncles , teachers , friends , all offered bits of advice and stories about Ilya . Ilya 's face got redder and redder as the stories piled one on top of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't signed any papers yet .. . Do n't scare her off ! " After dessert , we squatted in a circle around a large rotating table and sampled a variety of drinks and liqueurs . They drank more than any Martians I had met , yet kept their dignity and intelligence at all times . Ti Sandra took me aside toward the end of the evening , saying she wanted to show me her prize tropical garden . The garden was beautiful , but she did not spend much time with the tour . " I know a little about you , Casseia . What I 've heard impressed the hell out of me . We may not look it , but we 're an ambitious little family , you know that ? " " Ilya 's given me some hints . " " Some of us have been studying the Charter and thinking things through . You 've had a lot of experience in politics ... " " Not that much . Government and management . . . from the point of view of one BM . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a unique opportunity in this  | BM . Nobody hates us . We go everywhere , meet everybody , we 're friendly ... A lot of trust . We think we might have something to offer Mars . " " I 'm sure you do , " I said . " Shall we talk more later ? " Her eyes twinkled , but her face was stern , an expression I would come to know very well in the months ahead . Ti Sandra had bigger plans  --  and more talents  --  than I could possibly have imagined then . Ilya and I honeymooned at Cyane Sulci , a few hundred kilometers east of Lycus Sulci . For transportation , we used Professor Jordan-Erzul 's portable lab , a ten-meter-long cylinder that rolled on seven huge spring-steel tires . The interior was cramped and dusty , with two pull-down cots , rudimentary nano kitchen producing pasty recycled food , sponge-baths only . The air smelled of sizzle and flopsand and we sneezed all the time . I have never been happier or more at ease in my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a pressure suit , accompanying my husband across the lava ridges to deep gorges where mother cysts might be found . Diversity had never completely separated life on Mars ; co-genotypic bauplans , creatures having different forms but a common progenitor , had been the rule . On Earth , such manifestations had been limited to different stages of growth in individual animals  --  caterpillar to butterfly , for example . On Mars , a single reproductive organism , depending on the circumstances , could generate offspring with a wide variety of shapes and functions . Those forms which did not survive , did not return to " check in " with the reproductive organism and were not replicated in the next breeding cycle . New forms could be created from a morphological grabbag , following rules we could only guess at . The reproducers themselves closed up and died after a few thousand years , laying eggs or cysts  --  some of which had been fossilized . The mothers had been the greatest triumph of this strategy . A single mother cyst , blessed with proper conditions , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties of offspring , plant-like and animal-like forms together , designed to interact as an ecos . These would spread across millions of hectares , surviving for thousands of years before running through their carefully marshaled resources . The ecos would shrink , wither , and die ; new cysts would be laid , and the waiting would begin again . Across the ages , the Martian springtimes of flash floods and heavier atmosphere from evaporating carbon dioxide came farther apart , and finally stopped , and the cysts ceased blooming . Mars finally died . p 217 Fossil mother cysts were most often buried a few meters below the lip of a gorge , revealed by landslides . Typically , remains of the mother 's sons and daughters  --  delicate spongy calcareous bones and shells , even membranes tanned by exposure to ultraviolet before being buried  --  would lie in compacted layers around the cysts , clueing us to their locations with a darker stain in the soil . Months before we met , Ilya and Kiqui discovered that the last bloom of a mother ecos had occurred , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter billion . The puzzle remained , however : no organic molecules could remain viable across the tens of thousands of years that the cysts had typically lay buried between blooms . We parked the lab at the end of a finger of comparatively smooth terrain . A few dozen meters beyond our parking place on the finger lay hundreds upon thousands of labyrinthine cracks and arroyos : the sulci . Fifty meters away , within a particularly productive shallow arroyo , stood a specimen storage shed of corrugated metal sheeting draped with plastic tarps . Hours after we arrived , Ilya introduced me to a cracked cyst in the shed . " Casseia , meet mother , " he said . " Mother , this is Casseia . Mother is n't feeling well today . " Two meters wide , it lay in a steel cradle in the unpressurized building . He let me run my gloved hands along its dark rocky exterior . As he shined a torch to cast out the gloom , I reached into the interior and felt with gloved fingers the tortuous , sparkling folds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These were the last , " he said . " The Omega . " Nobody knew how cysts bloomed . Nobody knew the significance of this purely inorganic structure . The generally accepted theory was that the cysts once contained soft reproductive organs , but no remains of such organs had been found . I studied the cyst 's interior closely , vainly hoping to see some clue the scientists might have missed . " You 've found offspring around open cysts ? and mothers themselves  --  but no actual connections between . " " All we 've found have been late Omega hatchings , " Ilya said . " They died before their ecos could reach maturity . The remains were close enough to convince . " I listened to the sound of my own breathing for a moment , the gentle sighs of the cycler . " Have you ever dug an aqueduct bridge ? " " When I was a student , " Ilya said . " Beautiful things . " We left the shed and stood under the comparatively clear sky . I was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was becoming familiar ; however hostile , it touched me deeply , its past and present . I had  | been seeing it through Ilya 's eyes , and Ilya did not judge Mars by any standards but its own . " Which part of Earth would you like to visit ? " I asked . " The deserts , " he said . " Not the rain forests ? " He grinned behind his face plate . " Better fossils in dry places . " We climbed into the lab , destatted and sucked off our dust , and ate soup in the cramped kitchen . We had barely finished our cups when a shrill alarm came from our slates and the lab 's coin . Emergency displays automatically flickered before us . The distinctive masculine voice of Security Mars spoke . " A cyclonic low-pressure system in Arcadia Planitia has produced a force ten pressure surge moving southwest at eight-hundred and thirty kiphs . All stations and teams between Alba Patera in the north and Gordii Dorsum in the south are advised to take emergency precautions . " Graphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superimposed on a projected map . The surge resembled a thin curving smudge of charcoal drawn over the terrain . Its numbers were impressive : two thousand kilometers long , following a great-circle contour , absolutely clear atmosphere ahead and murk behind , with a dark pressure curl along its central axis . The surge had already reached a pressure of one third of a bar  --  almost fifty times normal . First seen in the twentieth in early Viking photographs , surges were the worst Mars had to offer . Induced by supersonic shock-waves , the high-pressure curls were unique to Mars , with its thin atmosphere , cold days , and even colder nights . Here , the borders between night and day could become weather fronts in themselves . There were no oceans , as on Earth , to liberate heat slowly and mediate between ground and sky .. . At nightfall , the ground cooled quickly , and the thin air above the ground descended dramatically , only to warm and rise rapidly at daybreak . Most of the time , the worst weather patterns Mars could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These spread across basins and plains , covering everything with dust but producing only slight changes in barometric pressure . Under the right conditions , however , and in the proper terrain  --  crossing the plains of the northern lowlands , in midmorning or late evening ? winds generated by the terminator could exceed the speed of sound , compressing the air to as much as a hundred times its normal pressure of four to seven millibars . Passing from the plains to rough terrain , the shock-wave could be given a deft horizontal spin , producing a super- p 219 dense rolling curl that picked up huge volumes of fine clay , and sand , and at peak , even pebbles and rocks . Ilya and I immediately suited and set to work lowering the mobile lab and shooting anchors deep into the soil and rock beneath . We slung cables over the lab from anchor to anchor , then pulled folded plastic foils from the boot in the lab 's round stern , stretching them from the ground and fastening them to the lab 's sides to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper shape . It would also function as a shield against debris . " We 've got about ten minutes , " I said . We both looked into the arroyo at the slab-sided shed with its precious specimens , a tin shanty that would love to fly . " There 's a spare tarp and foil , " Ilya said . " We can rig it in six minutes ? or we can get inside . " " Rig it , " I said . He grabbed my hand and squeezed it . We worked quickly . Surges could be terribly destructive even to a buried station if it was unprepared . The center of a surge 's curl could compress to as much as half a bar , a rolling-pin of tight-packed air moving at well over eight hundred kiphs ; and the farther a surge rolled , the tighter it packed , until it blew itself out against a volcano or plateau and spread dust and cyclones over half of Mars . We stiffened the shed 's foil and kicked the tarp pegs . All was firm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . A little excavator clambered up from a fresh-dug trench under the lab 's cylindrical body and fastened itself to its receptacle in the bottom of the lab . We crawled into the trench and spread our personnel foils . The foils undulated , stiffened , and glued themselves to the edges of the trench . Ilya switched on a torch and shined it in our faces . We lay in the coffinshaped ditch , with two layers of foil and the ponderous mobile lab over our heads , hands tight-clenched . Outside : a horrid empty silence . Even the rock was quiet ; the surge was still dozens of kilometers away . Ilya removed his slate from his utility belt and instructed the mobile lab 's roof camera to show us what was happening . To the northwest , all was dark gray shot through with streaks of brown . " Are we cozy ? " he asked . Our helmet radios whined faintly , we lay so close together . " Snug as bunnies in a pot , " I said , teeth clenched . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could n't clamp my hand over his mouth , but I made the gesture against his helmet anyway . " Shh , " I said . " Tell me a story . "  | Ilya excelled at making up fairy tales on the spur of the moment . " Now ? " he asked . " Please . " " Long ago , " he began , voice husky , " and long after now , two rabbits dug a hole in the farmer 's garden and ate through all of his water lines . . . " I closed my eyes , listening . Our helmets pressed against the rocks and each other . Before Ilya had finished the story , I laid my hand against the bottom of the ditch , palm flat to pick up vibrations . The line of dust and compressed atmosphere to the west stretched inky-black and very close . It began to obscure the horizon . Only seconds now .. . All around , through the rocks , we heard a low grumbling , then a distinct , rhythmic pounding . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffalo . " We had all seen Terrie Westerns . Ilya placed his hand over mine . " Freight trains , " he said . " Hundreds of them . " I began to shiver . " Have you been through one of these ? " I asked . " When I was a kid , " he said . " In a station . " " Anybody hurt ? " He shook his head . " Small one . Only a quarter of a bar . Made a lot of noise when it went over . " " What does it sound like when it goes over ? " He was about to tell me when I heard for myself . The sound started out ghostly  --  the sibilant patient whine of a strong Martian wind , audible through our helmets even in the trench , backed by the staccato of pebbles and dust striking against the foils and tarps . The blackness seemed to leap over the land . I felt pressure in my ears , thin fingers pushing into my head . I opened my eyes to slits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Ilya . He lay on his back , shoulder wedged against the side of the trench , staring up , eyes searching . " This is going to be a bad one , " he said . " I 'll finish the story later , okay ? " " Okay . But do n't forget . " I shut my eyes again . For a moment , the surge sounded like huge drums . A thin shriek descended into a monstrous , horrifying bellow . I thought of a ravening god marching over the land , Mars itself , god of war , furious and implacable , searching for things that might be frightened , things that might die . The pressure suit loosened around me , then clung tight to my skin . A sharp pain in my ears made me screw up my face and groan . The torch p 221 fell between us . Ilya grabbed it again , shined it on his face , shook his head , face slick with tears , and held me tightly . I could feel his heart through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We lay for a moment , waiting for it to begin again . I started to get up , pushing against the tarp , frantic to see daylight  --  but Ilya grabbed my shoulder and pressed me down . I could not hear very well . The torch illuminated his face ; he was trying to mouth words to me . Somehow I understood through my fear ? rocks and dust would be falling outside . We might be killed by rocks falling from thousands of meters in the wake of the surge , striking at eighty or ninety meters per second . I pressed myself against him , mind racing , grimacing at the pain . Time passed very slowly . My fear turned to numbness , and the numbness faded into relief . We were not going to die . The worst of the surge had passed over and we were still in the trench  --  but a new fear hit me , and I had to fight myself to keep from clawing out of Ilya 's embrace . We could be buried under a fresh dune  --  tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We would never dig out . Our oxygen would be depleted and we would suffocate , this trench would become just what it seemed , a grave . . . I began to squirm , breath harsh and short , and Ilya struggled to keep his arms around me . " Let me go ! " I shouted . Suddenly , I flinched and stopped thrashing . A light had hit me in the face , not our torch . The lab 's arbeiters were ripping away the foils and tarps , searching for us . The chief arbeiter appeared on the edge of our trench . A jointed arm had been wrenched loose and the machine was covered with dents and red smears  --  rock impacts . It had weathered the storm outside , tending the edges of the foil until the last moment . It must have been blown around like a small can . Ilya pulled me up out of the ditch in deathly silence . The mobile lab was still intact above us ; we might be able to get to a station on our own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physical contact than any other reason . I felt light-headed , giddy with still being alive . We walked beneath the main foil and tarps , inspecting the lab , then emerged to stand in the open . The foil on the specimen shed had failed . It was nowhere to be seen . The sky from horizon to horizon glowered charcoal-gray , almost black . Dust fell in thick snaking curtains , great sheets unrolling , drifting , hiding . We gathered the arbeiters beneath the lab and climbed the steps into the airlock , quickly sucking the gray dust from our suits , then stripped . Ilya insisted I lie on the narrow fold-down cot . He lay on his cot across  | from me , then got up and pushed in close beside me . We shivered like frightened children . We slept for an hour . When we awoke , I felt ecstatic as if from drinking far too much high-powered tea . Everything seemed sharply defined and highly colored . Even the dust in the lab interior smelled sweet and essential . The pain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could still hear , but just barely . Ilya showed me the lab 's weather record . The surge had topped at two bars . " That 's impossible , " I said . He shook his head and smiled , tapping his own ears with a finger . Then he wrote on his slate , " Compressible fluids  --  a lot to learn . " He added with a rueful grimace , " Some honeymoon . I love you ! " With little ceremony , and not much in the way of clothing left to remove , we celebrated still being alive . We checked in with the satcoms to tell everybody we had survived and could take care of ourselves . Resources were strained from Arcadia to Mariner Valley  --  the surge had sheared into three parts crossing the Tharsis volcanoes , and twenty-three stations had been hit by the threeheaded monster . There were casualties  --  seven dead , hundreds injured . Even UMS had suffered damage . Ilya and I inspected the lab from outside , elevating the tires again and cutting the tie-downs . The foils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung by the surge . Minor damage could be fixed by patches . We decided to collect what specimens we could from the shed 's remains and drive the lab back to Olympus Station . Replacing our suit tanks and purifiers , we walked west from the lab several dozen meters . Ilya was somber . My tinnitus had passed but hearing was still difficult ? his voice in my com was a barely understandable buzz . " Looks as if we 've lost the cyst , " he said . The shed itself was nowhere to be found  --  it might have blown clear to Tharsis by now . But it would undoubtedly have spilled its heavy contents . I looked up through the thinning curtains of dust . The sky peeking through the gray seemed greenish . I had never seen that color before . I pointed it out to Ilya . He frowned , looked back at the lab , then set his jaw and said we should keep searching . The air temperature hovered just above zero . It should have been thirty or forty below at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My ecstasy was fading rapidly . " Please , " I muttered . " Enough . I 'm not an adventurous woman . " p 223 " What ? " Ilya asked . " It 's hot out here and I do n't know what that means . " " Neither do I , " Ilya said . " But I do n't think it 's dangerous . There have n't been any more warnings . " " Maybe something local is brewing , " I said . " Everyone knows weird weather lives in the sulci . " He vaulted across a wind-exposed boulder and picked up a pale brown cylindrical rock . " One of our core specimens . Maybe the shed dumped its load here . " " I think we should go back . " Ilya stood and frowned deeply , caught between wanting to please me and a powerful need to find something , anything , of the broken cyst and the other specimens . Suddenly , I regretted being such a coward . " But let 's look a little longer . " " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him to the edge of a canyon . A hundred meters below , fine dust drifted like a river through the canyon bottom . Gray dust mixed with swirls of ochre and red , immiscible fluids , Jovian ; I had never seen anything like it . Ilya kneeled and I squatted beside him . " If they fell down there ? " he said , and shook his head . Our suits were covered with clinging gray dust ; the suck and destat in the lab might not be able to remove enough to keep it from getting into the recycling systems , into our skin . I imagined smear rashes itching all night long . Something fogged the outside of my face-plate . I reached up to wipe it . A muddy streak formed under my touch . I swore and removed a static rag from my waist pack . The rag did not work . I could hardly see . " The dust is wet , " I said . " Ca n't be . There 's not enough pressure , " Ilya said . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one finger , then examined the finger . " You 're right . You 're wet . Am I ? " His face plate had fogged as well . I touched his helmet . " Yeah , " I said . " Jesus . Just a few more minutes , " he pleaded . Over the canyon , afternoon sun broke through clouds of dust . Green-tinted rays swept across the rugged furrows of the sulci , casting the landscape in a ghoulish light interrupted by deep shadows . We backed away from the rubble at the edge of the canyon . Ilya kicked wind-exposed rocks aside and slogged through drifts of familiar red smear and the superfine gray dust . There was no sizzle anywhere . It had been mixed with unradiated clays and flopsand . Years might pass before ultraviolet could convert the surface to crackly sizzle again . " The surge must have uncovered an ice aquifer nearby . Pebble salta-  | tion blasted it , " Ilya said . " This gray stuff must be ice dust , and down here , it 's just warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a groan . " Up there , " he said , pointing to the top of a low ridge . A jagged lump of rock about a meter wide presented a flash of crystal in the broken rays of afternoon sun . We climbed . I looked back over my shoulder at the lab , half a kilometer away . My back muscles tensed with a red rabbit 's instinct to run and hide . The surge was gone , but wet dust was completely outside my experience . We might sink into a depression and drown . I had no idea how our filters and seals would function in water . Ilya reached the top of the ridge first . He knelt before the exposed lump of rock . " Is it the cyst ? " I asked . He did not answer . I stood behind him and peered at the shiny exposed face . It was indeed part of a cyst  --  very likely the cyst that had tumbled from the shed . It lay half-buried in a hole filled with gray dust . The intricate patterns of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I thought it might be the weird light . But where the fragment of cyst met the pool of dust , a thick gelatinous layer spilled and churned . " What 's that ? " I asked . " Something in suspension , " Ilya suggested . He reached out to touch the gelatinous material . It clung to his glove . " Snail spit , " I said . " Genuine grade-A slime , " Ilya agreed , lifting his glove . " Why does n't it dry out ? " I asked . He looked at me , forehead pale , cheeks flushed , eyes wide . I could hear his rapid breathing over the com . " There 's water all around . The gray dust is ice and clays , and the clays are keeping the ice from sublimating . But the temperature is high enough the ice melts , and the cyst can get at the moisture . It 's the right mix . It has what it wants . " The slime grew thicker as we watched . Within , white streaks formed little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses ? " he asked , measuring the fragment with his arms . " Maybe a quarter ton , " I said . " We could n't carry it far . The lab might roll close enough , we could get the strongest arbeiter up here . . . " I removed my slate and set it for visual record . " Good thinking , " Ilya said . He put a sample of the slime into a vial , capturing parts of the lacework as well . " Do you think it 's ? " I began to ask . p 225 " Do n't even say it , " he warned . " Whatever it is , it 's a tricking wonder . " He sounded like a little boy with a new toy . I looked up at the curtains of gray , the sun dazzling through the clouds . This was as close as Mars could get to rain . " It 's just a fragment , " Ilya said , trying to rock the piece of cyst in its cradle of pebbles and dust . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He passed me the vial . As he took more samples , I stared at the lacework within the captured fluid . It measured no more than two centimeters across , as fine as gossamer . I had no idea what it was  --  a bit of cellular skeleton , a template for cytoplasm , a seed , an egg , a tiny little baby . Perhaps a Martian . Within two days of returning to Olympus Station , we were famous . Journals on LitVid and ex nets across the Triple lauded us for making an epochal discovery  --  the first viable , non-Terrestrial life discovered in our Solar System . That we had made the discovery on our honeymoon only threw petrol on the celebrity fires . The discovery was more than a little embarrassing to the Martian science community . Ilya was a fossil hunter and areologist , a digger , hardly trained in biochemistry at all ; there was considerable resentment , even skepticism , at first  --  that we should have been in the right place , at the right time , to witness a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks accepting or dodging interviews . Messages flooded in : offers of vast fortunes for a whole cyst ( Ilya did not personally own any of the cysts he had found  --  they belonged to Erzul , of course ) ; requests for information from schoolchildren ; offers to turn our story into LitVids and sims . No one in the general public seemed to care that the plasm from the cyst died before we got it back to Olympus . The " Martian " degenerated in a few hours to simple proteins and monosaccharides , remarkable enough coming from clay and quartz and mineral-rich water , but hardly the stuff of romance . We had demonstrated two things , however . The cysts might still be viable , and the genetic information for a Martian ecos was contained in the mineral formations within the cyst , locked in the minute intricacies of clay and quartz . There had probably never been extra organs to help ecos reproduction . But cyst fragments could not reproduce even a portion of an ecos . Whole cysts were necessary
