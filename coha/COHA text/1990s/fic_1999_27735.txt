High summer and Friendship 's quiet . The men tend the shimmering fields . Children tramp the woods , wade the creeks , sound the cool ponds . In town , women pause in the heavy air of the millinery , linger over bolts of yard goods , barrels of clumped flour . The only sound 's the freight drumming through to the south , tossing its plume of cinders above the treetops , the trucks clicking a mile off . Then quiet , the buzz of insects , the breathless afternoon . Cows twitch and flick . You like it like this , the bright , languid days . It could stand to rain , everyone says , the sawdust piles at the mill dry as powder , the great heaps of slash in the woods dangerous , baked to tinder , but there 's something to the heat , the way it draws waves from tarpaper , stifles sound , closes town in . Winter was full of chimney fires and horses frozen on the plank road , and spring was hard , with the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her garden thick , tomatoes fist-sized . Except Millie and Elsa Sullivan going at it with their flatware , and Mrs. Goetz passing in church , you have n't had much business of late , which is fine with you . Not that you mind earning your money , but when folks have need of you it 's someone 's misfortune one way or the other . The undertaking 's easy ; being a constable is hard . When you put them together it can be too much , though that 's only happened once since you 've been back . And you got through that fine , did the Soderholms proud . With his head cocked on the pillow and his hair combed just so , you could n't see where his brother conked him , and Eric , for his part , went easy , even came to the funeral in irons and his Sunday suit . You led him up to the casket for his last respects . " I did n't mean it so hard , " he said , not really sorry , still mad at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the river above the mill dam to see if it would drown . It did n't , but by then it was too late to save either of the Soderholm brothers . It was just a plain rock , you picked it up in one hand , weighed it like an egg . Cain and Abel , you thought your mother 's love of Bible stories bubbling up then thought it did n't fit . It was an accident , two good boys like that . When you told Marta , she cried . The marshal who rode the mail stage up from Madison shook his head like it figured , a dying old lead town like Friendship . He squinted at the empty storefronts in judgment The Marquette County Record , the First Bank of Wisconsin . You had the one brother in the cell and the other on a block in the icehouse , sawdust stuck to his jaw . You had the rock in a cheese box and the boy 's confession ready for the marshal to take back to the capital . He was surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull . " You do anything else ? " he asked . " Preach a little , " you said , trying not to sound proud . He was n't really interested , only joking , so you did n't go into how you see all three as related , ways to give praise and thanks for this paradise . He was n't that kind of man he would have laughed at you . Others around town do , some kiddingly . It 's all right . They 'll all come to you someday , and they know you 'll do right by them . It 's a contract , an honor , you tell them . Friendship 's my town , you say , and they think you 're too serious , too sentimental , a fool . They think the war did something to you . Maybe so , but for the good , you think . That kind of talk does n't temper your fondness for them . It 's not just the job that makes you responsible . It is your town , they are your people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ducks setting up a racket if anyone comes near . Today they send for you , or Old Man Meyer sends his littlest , Bitsi . She comes running , kicking up dust , getting her stockings dirty . " Sheriff Hansen ! Sheriff Hansen ! " You 're standing on the stairs outside , ignoring the big bay hitched outside of Fenton 's dipping at the water trough . That 's the one thing you 'll admit is strange about you : you do n't like to be around horses anymore . It 's understandable , having had to eat them during the siege , to burrow into their warm , dead guts for cover , but you do n't talk about that , or only to Marta , who 'd never let it slip . It 's come so no one asks why you ride the bicycle or pump the handcar along the rusty company spurs in the backwoods . The old hands must explain it to the newer immigrants the Norwegians come to join family , the Poles who step off the stage looking stunned , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bitsi tackles your leg , hauls on your arm , too winded to get anything out . " Pa said come . Pa said come quick . " " Whoa , whoa , " you say . It could be anything , nothing . Old Meyer 's back pasture butts up against the Holy Light Colony , and the last few weeks he 's had you out about people wandering through the woods at night with lit candles . It 's a worry with everything so dry , but Meyer 's real objection is with the Colony itself . It 's new , mostly city folk , led by a man named Chase . The place runs back into the hills ; Chase bought up the old Nokes claim the mansion , the camp , everything . People say he preaches the Last Times . They say he leads services in the mines at night , that he shares his disciples ' wives , that he eats nothing but unleavened bread , like some desert prophet , some wild-eyed stylite . You 've met him once , and he seemed reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of him , a fact you pride yourself on . It defines you , this willingness to hear all sides , love everyone . You 've stopped believing in evil . Is that a sin ? You know what your mother would say , but justice needs to be fair-handed , the dead deserve your compassion . It 's your job to understand , to forgive , not simply your custom . You kneel beside Bitsi so you 're face to face . " Now slow down . What is it , honey ? " " Pa says there 's a dead man . " " Someone from the Colony ? " " Pa found him back of the beehive . You got ta come . " You fit her on the handlebars and set off , wobbly , then straighten out . It 's been so dry the roads are ground down flat , a treat after the frost heaves , the muds of April . Bitsi 's never been on a bike before , and she 's laughing , her fingers clenched white . You fly down halls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box of Ender 's bridge , break into blinding sunlight . Behind you in town , steam boils up from the mill , sits thick as clotted cream in the bright sky . The church bell calls noon , the sound flat and weak in the heat . Not a swallow of air , just the shrill of hidden cicadas , grasshoppers popping up . A single cloud sails on the horizon , as if cut adrift . The Meyer boys are in the garden , hoeing , twins in matching overalls . Marcus and Thaddeus . Twins . You 're having a hard enough time with just Amelia , her all-night colic . Marta 's tired all the time . Doc Guterson says it 's normal , but that 's no comfort . The Meyer boys stop and smile , polite . When they tip their straw hats , you can see where their tans stop , their foreheads bright as whitewash . " Sheriff , " they say . Your real title 's constable , but only Marta ever calls you that , and only in bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one says , and you look to the other as if it 's his turn . He grins blankly . You tip your hat , obliged , and Bitsi leads you past them . Old Meyer 's behind the house , scraping honeycomb into a bowl . His netting is thrown back , and a single bee sits on one cheek like a tear . He points the dripping knife at the treeline . " Back there 's a young fella dead , I do n't know who . " " Tramp ? " you guess , because it 's been a hard year , a lot of men moving through , looking for work . " Could be . Look like he 's in the war by his get-up . " That 's usually a clue ; a lot of men never went home . Six years and they 're still pitching and striking camp , marching at dawn . " What do you think happened ? " you ask . " Coul n't say . Di n't look at him that hard , just saw he 's dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back 's he in ? " " Just keep going straight , " Old Meyer says , pointing the knife . " You 'll find him . " Meyer 's right . After a minute of picking through prickers , the heavy reek of rendered fat clamps around you like smoke . In a strange way , it 's almost welcome ; after the relief of the siege , your regiment had the job of searching for casualties , and this familiar smell in the middle of a Kentucky swamp meant some mother would get her son back . This is n't so different . The man you come across is lying belly-down beside the smudge of a dead campfire . It 's gone all night , the stones cracked and blackened . The cuffs of his private 's blues are frayed white , the buttons missing . He 's not green , more yellow , but definitely young your age , no more than thirty , and beardless . You do n't see any wounds . His face is so drawn , the eyes so deeply sunken , that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would take days . This looks quick , one minute sitting on the log , the next pitching over . Dropped from behind , coldcocked . You think of Eric Soderholm and his stone , the dog in the water . You wonder if it barked , if the boys could hear it over the falls . Under a fern lies the same tin cup that rattled at your hip for three years . He 's got the same jacket , the same belt , the same cap you came home in . You squat and sniff the cup . Coffee . Straighten up and look around for the pot he boiled it in , for his stores . One of his pockets is sticking out like a white flag , and you check the woods as if the killer might be watching you . He 's long gone , probably out of the county by now . You 'll wire down the line to Shawano , tell Bart Cox to keep an eye out for tramps . Bart went to see the elephant with you and caught a minie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healed crooked , then went bad ; Bart 's still a crack shot with his other . He was a sergeant , and has less sympathy than you for these transients brother soldiers be damned . But there are a lot of them out there , and your mother 's missionary blood rises every time you think of them . They travel in twos often as not . Sad really , this one . Probably thought the man was his friend . " God have mercy , " you pray , then turn him over . No blood on his filthy undershirt , no bullet holes , no bowie knife slipped between the ribs . His cuticles are purple , like he 's dipped them in wine , and you wonder how long it 's been . You 'll have to talk to Doc , see what he says . You tuck the cap and the cup into the man 's jacket , cross his arms over his belly , though they do n't want to go . This is how they taught you in the army ; it 's easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , note the sliver-thin heels on his army-issue boots , the cracked leather . There 's no pretty way to do this , though you try to be careful . One day when your regiment was combing a meadow you broke a man 's jaw for propping a dead Reb against a fencepost for a joke . If there 's anything your jobs have taught you , it 's to take death seriously , give it the same respect as love . " It 's all right , " you find yourself saying to him . " We 'll get you set proper , do n't you fret . " It 's a bad habit , talking to the dead . Marta says you say more to them than the living , and while she 's kidding , it just might be true . Sometimes in the cellar you hold long conversations with those you 're working over , answering your own questions as you drain their veins , trying to find out what you really think about justice , destiny , Heaven . You wonder if you 're getting too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say , and the man nods , his head jostling through a patch of wild aster , and you feel bad for joking with him . Spooked . It 's just the uniform , the recognition that this could be you . By the time you get him to the hives , you 're somber , and even the bees ' mad industry does n't bring a smile . Meyer 's still filling the bowl with clots of honey , the handle of the knife and his thin buckskin gloves dark with it . He has one of the twins pull his rig alongside the weeds and help you lift the dead man into the back . The springs squeak . The boy makes a face at the smell , tries not to look at the body . He seems incomplete without his brother , diminished . You do n't know which one it is , Marcus or Thaddeus . " Can we get something to cover him , " you say , and not just from respect . You do n't need folks in town gawking , making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been Friendship 's biggest industry . The boy comes back with a scrap of burlap and you fashion it over the body yourself . He climbs up on the seat . The smell of the horses is getting to you , making you think of mud , the way your stomach clenched when the Reb artillery whistled over . " Take him straight to Doc Guterson 's , " you tell him . " Yes , sir , " he says , still afraid to look back , and teases the reins to set the team walking . The dead man bounces as they cross the yard , his heels banging the bed . The tin cup clatters , then slides off into the grass with a glint . Bitsi dashes through the timothy and scoops it up like a prize chick and gives it to you . The metal 's already begun to warm . You tuck it in your pocket and head for your bicycle , leaning in the shade of the eaves . You want to get to town first , and you know boys when their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meyer calls over . " Well , we 'll find out . " " I do n't know why they got ta come here , there 's no work for them . Betcha I 'll load up the gun with rock salt tonight , sure . " " Set your dogs out , that 'll take care of them . Say , which one 's that driving ? " " That 's Thaddeus . " " Any problems with the Colony ? " " Nope , pretty quiet lately . " " That 's good . You did n't touch him or move him around , " you ask , sure that Meyer did n't , but it 's your job to be suspicious , to think of things other people would n't . " No , sir . I wanted nothing to do with him , you bet . " " All right , " you say , and trade a last batch of pleasantries , thank Bitsi and set off . The dust on the road has settled and you can see the ruts left by Meyer 's rig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to post , calling . With every pump of your legs , the cup in your pocket worries your crotch . You do n't like that Meyer called you sir . He 's had money problems , that 's why he 's putting up honey to sell in town . He would n't kill a man , and he probably would n't rob one , but if there was something lying around he might just pick it up . That would n't have been true before his Alma died , but now he 's got the twins and Bitsi all by himself , and that can make a man desperate . Last month in Shawano Oly Marsden lost two calves and the stationmaster shot him trying to rob the depot . Bart said he did n't even tie a mask on , just walked up to the window with a shotgun like it was his due . The stationmaster had a skeet pistol and put a hole through Oly 's Adam 's apple . So there was a man who drove his daughters to the parish dances , bleeding to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noon train flowing around him like he was nothing . You do n't like to think this way , so you stand up on the pedals and reach down and push the cup around so it does n't fuss with you so much . By law , the man was trespassing , so if Meyer did do something , he was in his rights . But that 's a quibble , not really the spirit of the law . Meyer did n't kill him . Maybe he turned out his pockets , shook his pack out in the grass . Not honorable certainly , but criminal ? You shake your head to dismiss it . A man 's dead , there 's no room for these fine distinctions . Murder 's always simple . You mark the dust before you see the rig plodding along , the burlap thrown over him , Thaddeus still not looking back . You dip the brim of your hat , tuck your head down to keep the dust out of your eyes ; it sticks to your lashes , powders your jacket . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then give him a wave . In a few minutes you ca n't even see him behind you , only the fields , the treeline , the sky . It 's a perfect day , but you see the man sprawled across the fire , his one cheek dark with charcoal . You 'll talk to Doc , he 'll figure it out . You know it 's best not to think too long on these things . Karmanns started haying last week , and as you pass , thinking of the snap beans Marta promised this morning , you see a woman lying in the brilliant stubble . At first you think it 's a fieldhand catching a nap , but she 's wearing a shift , her hair bright as the dry ricks . She 's facedown like your friend in the rig , and you slow and hop off and jump the ditch , thinking it ca n't be , two in the same day . Before you even reach her , you panic and wonder if it 's the work of one person , like those little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was evil . Bart showed you the odd parts , the marks on their bodies , and while you prided yourself on having seen worse , this was n't the war , these were just children . You helped Bart burn the smith 's barn and then his house to the ground while the whole town watched , silent as mourners . It was a distraction ; while you and Bart offered up his property , the smith was being whisked out the back door of the courthouse by the same marshal who took care of Eric Soderholm . Tromping across the stubble , you wonder if the smith could have broken out of Mendota , if you 'll have to wire Bart and tell him to bring the dogs . And it was such a pretty day too , you think , that quiet you like . Even now the trees are calm , riffling with the slightest breeze , then subsiding . Closer , you can see she 's a good-sized woman , older . She 's from the city ; you can tell by the gauzy chemise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colony . Occasionally they escape , go off on frolics in the saloons , and you have to corral them . You peer off over the field for a sign of Karmann or his boys , but there 's no one , only a hawk riding the day 's heat , spiraling high . Her legs are scratched and bleeding , her stockings torn . You kneel by her feet for a better look . One line of blood 's fresh , still wet , and when you touch a finger to it to make sure , she flips over and kicks your hand away . You back up , automatically going for your Colt , but your hand never gets there because you 're lost in watching her . She jerks as if pitching a fit , thrashes her head side to side . Her neck is dirty , her hair all snarls , as if she 's been living in the woods . You think of the Hermit 's missing teeth , his curling fingernails , and pull your jacket back over the butt of your gun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus Jesus Jesus . " " Ma'am ! " you say , " Ma'am . " It takes a while , but she slows , lets her head drop . " Jesus I love you , Jesus I love you . " It 's like singing , pleading . Her eyes are squeezed so tight she 's crying , but she sounds happy . " I love Jesus . " It 's ecstasy , you see it each July when the revival comes through , their wagons painted with biblical scenes , bright as the circus . You 've always thought it was fake , this rapture , a stage trick , a shill egging on the susceptible , filling the tent . You know the Lord as well as anyone , and there 's no call for all that show . Could be she 's been drinking . " Ma'am , " you say , and take her arm . She lets you help her up , muttering , " Jesus my Lord and savior , " but when you try to lead her back to the road , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She writhes in the hay at your feet . " Really , ma'am , " you scold her . It 's too hot for this , too buggy . You 'll have to ride the handcar out the Nokes spur to the Colony now , see Chase . You look back to the road , and there 's Thaddeus , the rig stirring up dust . You wave both arms over your head , and he slows , the cloud closing over him . The woman 's gone quiet again , mumbling , eyes dull . She coughs and brings up something , a string hanging off her chin , and you step back , thinking she might be wild , mad like an animal . You 've seen a diseased hog take a chunk out of a man 's knee , the foam dripping green from its lips . " I saw Jesus , " she says , acknowledging you for the first time , and you think she 's just sick , that there must be a simple reason behind all this . " I saw Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed at you , a fact you seem to be disputing . " I know you did , " you say , because it 's foolish to argue with crazy people . You offer her your hand and she takes it and you pull her up again . " He was so beautiful . He 's been waiting for me . " " For all of us , " you say . " Yes , " she says . " How did you know ? " " I know something of him . " " Brother Chase says he saves all of us , the cleansed and the sick . Do you think that 's true ? " She stops and gapes at you as if you really might know . " Of course , " you say , " we 're all saved , " and steer her across the field . It 's not a convenient lie either ; you truly believe this . Otherwise you would n't have taken Reverend Toomey 's place , preaching from his pulpit after the diocese called him back to Madison . Deacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find they 've given the milk-hand a black eye , that their youngest got himself cut up in a sporting house over in Shawano . It 's all of a piece , you think ; sheriff or deacon , you 're trying to remind them of their best instincts , their better selves . " All ! " She laughs . " Ah , Brother , but you 're not sick . " " No , " you concede . " It 's easy to believe then . " You disagree with this but just nod . The whole idea of deathbed conversion strikes you as false , a sop for the dying . It 's when you 're happiest , sure of your own strength , that you need to bow down and talk with God . You wonder if that 's lax or fanatic . You know Marta worries when you make too much of your faith , so you 've taken to praying in your office when the cell 's empty , the stone cold and hard on your knees . There 's nothing desperate about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you 've given up trying to explain it . You ca n't , really . It 's a feeling of almost knowing something , of being close to some grand yet utterly simple answer . But what that answer is , you do n't know . It 's easier to hide it , keep it private , which makes you ashamed . You do n't trust people with secrets . You walk the woman toward Thaddeus , who meets you halfway . He shies back from her , and , unfairly , you think he 's some squeamish for a farmboy . Bitsi did n't have any trouble picking up that cup . " Have you seen Jesus ? " she asks him . He looks to you , unsure what to say . " No , ma'am , " he says , tentative . " He sees you , " she answers , as if the converse logically follows . Thaddeus looks to you helplessly . " He sees all of us , " you say . " That 's right , " the woman says , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that might be temporary . You 'll take her to Doc Guterson too . The team is a pair of big Belgians , the kind that used to draw the guns . They stand champing , veiny bellies wriggling to toss off flies . The soldier 's begun to stink with the heat , and you can feel the past oozing up like mud . You rearrange him under the burlap and lift the bike on , then hop up to give the woman a hand in . Thaddeus is glad to take the driver 's seat again . You shield the woman from the dead man , but she stares at the burlap , rubs her nose with the back of a hand . Thaddeus snaps the reins and the wheels grate over the road . Your bike settles , the man 's boots knock . " In Heaven you forget everything , " she says . " In Hell they make you remember . " No , you think , it 's the other way around . " Maybe so , " you say . " Everyone smells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid hands on him but it was too late . " " Was he at the Colony ? " " Brother Chase said it 's a sin , going against God 's will . I think it is now , I do . " " Daniel was your husband , " you ask , but she looks off over the fields . Weitzels are out haying , the smaller boy atop the wagon with a fork . Midsummer day , start to make hay . They 're almost done , just one row of ricks left . They wave , and you know the whole town will be discussing this over supper , speculating on who the woman was , and what you had in the back of Old Meyer 's rig . People will drop by tomorrow to see if she 's in the cell . " He takes the little ones first , " the woman says , and you ca n't help but think of Amelia . " I 'm very sorry , ma'am , " you say , thinking this might explain at least some of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven 's full of babies . " " It is . " She nods and coughs hard , and Thaddeus looks back an instant , as if he 's forgotten you 're there . From town comes the church bell tolling one . Doc should be getting up from his nap right about now , taking his collar off its stand , pinching the stays in place . He 'll be able to help her . The road turns along the river , under a row of weed trees . The heat makes the cicadas scream . As you rock through the dimness of Ender 's bridge , you can hear children splashing and laughing below , the rafters holding an echo , pigeons lowing , and you nudge the man 's boot back under the burlap . Into the sun again . The woman stares blankly at the wake of dust rising behind you . The ecstasy seems to have passed , and she looks spent , empty , old . The river 's low , the flats cracked mud , the reeds rotting . The Belgians nicker at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the last turn before Friendship proper , and the clapboard houses of your neighbors slide by , neat behind their picket fences , the oaks above a tunnel . You look up and the limbs pass overhead , dip as if blessing you . Flickers chirp , unseen . In the shade , the day seems easy again , but it 's a trick . There 's a man dead , a woman sick with grief . Still , you think , snap beans for supper . You 'll coax Marta into singing while you play the melodeon , and after Amelia 's down , the two of you will read to each other from Mrs. Stowe until you reach the end of the chapter . One of you will trim the lamp , and in the dark Marta 's hand will find yours . In bed you 'll need the comforter , you 'll snuggle down under it . That 's the nice thing about living so far north ; even in the heat of summer , the nights are cool . " Jacob , " she 'll say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her , silently saying your prayers , you 'll think , what a world this is , what luck you have , and you 'll thank God , you 'll let Him know how glad you are for everything even the heat , the dust , the tears of this madwoman . And even you , then , will wonder how you have such hope , and marvel at how impossible it is to stop the heart from reaching out to the whole world to all of your people here in Friendship , asleep under the summer moon and alone in the dark you 'll submit , give in to this great blessing , and think , yes , tomorrow will be a better day . Maybe you are a fool . You remember what your mother used to say about Reverend Toomey : a holy fool is still a fool . It 's not true , you think , not completely . Funny how you never agree to anything , keep that last piece of yourself back . Is it prudence or faithlessness and does it matter to anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sun hot on your hair . Fenton 's out in his apron , dusting a rug over the hitching rail with a wire beater . You check the woman ; she 's muttering , shrugging , arguing with herself . Yancey Thigpen 's mare is tied outside the livery , otherwise it 's quiet , only the steam pulsing up from the mill , the distant drone of the saws . Thaddeus draws the team even with Doc 's shingle . They stamp , their traces jingling , and you take the woman 's arm . " Thank you , " she says , stepping down . Across the street , Fenton 's stopped thumping the rug . You motion for Thaddeus to get the door . First he wipes his boots on the edge of the sidewalk , and you 're sorry for thinking poorly of him . The bell rings and you guide the woman inside . Doc 's parlor is empty and dark and smells of violets fresh from Irma 's garden . She picked out the furniture in Chicago , and no one wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inspecting the flocked wallpaper , the golden innards of the clock in its bell jar . " Hello , " you ask . " Be a minute , " Doc calls from the back , behind the curtain . He splashes water in a basin , bangs a cupboard shut . " It 's me , " you call . " I brought company . " He flings the curtain aside like a magician . He 's just gotten up , small and dapper in his pin-striped suit and stiff boiled shirt , hair parted in the middle and brilliantined , mustache waxed . People say he 's taken to fancy ways since marrying , but that 's jealousy . Irma 's from Milwaukee , a teacher at the state normal school , and a few families here with prettier daughters are still bitter . And he 's always been fastidious ; he orders his shoes through the mail , buys his shirts ten at a time . " Oh my dear , " he says , noticing the woman , and goes over to her . She 's bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , are we ? " " Careful there , " you say , and tell him how you found her . " Right , " he says , " I see , " more interested in her neck . " I do n't think that 's going to be a problem , do you ? " he asks her . " No , " she says absently , all the fight gone out of her . " Thank you . " He tips her chin up to feel along her jaw , and you notice a bandage on his hand . You ask . " Just clumsy , " he shrugs . He gives Thaddeus a nod . The boy returns it , his hat in both hands , shy , polite . " Why do n't you bring the other fellow in ? This may take a bit . " Thaddeus waits for you to move , and again you 're impatient with him . You forgot how hot it was , how bright . Fenton 's gone back inside , Yancey 's mare flinging her tail to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldier , drag him across the back of the wagon like a sack , get him under the armpits . The boy just stands there . " Lend a hand there , if you would , " you say , not too hard , and Thaddeus takes his ankles . You walk backward , your heels searching for the edge of the sidewalk , the step up . You 're glad he 's not a fat one . You remember wrestling Mrs. Goetz onto the table in the cellar , turning your knee and cursing her , then that night praying for patience . What was it you said last week in your sermon even the meanest work is a form of praise ? No wonder Marta worries you 'll end up in the Colony , dancing jaybird naked in the woods , a candle in each hand . You shoulder the door open and the bell tinkles . " Hold on , " Doc calls , and bursts through the curtain with his shirtsleeves rolled . " Put him down . " " Here ? " " Put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you can give him a look , he says it again . " On the floor . Now . " " What is it ? " you ask , but he 's pulled the burlap off and kneels by the man 's face the sunken eyes and greening skin . He leans in close as a lover , slips a hand between the man 's teeth and pulls down his jaw . " That lamp , " he says , pointing , and you give it to him . He sets the glass chimney aside and lights it , holds it over the man 's face . Flecks of wheat stick in his whiskers . Doc 's fingers rummage around in his mouth , under his tongue , as if searching for a hidden jewel . Beside you , Thaddeus is transfixed . Doc stands up and fits the lamp back together . " Take him next door and try not to touch him too much . " " What is it ? " " Just take him down the cellar for now . I 'll talk to you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You could say that . Just get him down , will you ? And make sure and wash up good , both of you . " " Okay , " you say , but hesitant , to let him know he 's being strange . You rearrange the burlap , pick the soldier up and walk backwards again , brushing the jamb , tottering down the walk one door to your place . It 's open , and as you maneuver through , you see Fenton over the boy 's shoulder , peering from his door . Thaddeus looks around your office at the empty cell , the rifles locked to the wall , the old posters . What an adventure he 's having ; how jealous Marcus will be . And now you 're taking him down to a room the boys of Friendship Whisper about , the boldest professing intimate knowledge around dying campfires . There 's nothing to see the clay walls , the table with its gutter draining into a pail , a few casks of fluid , a miter by a stack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools hang neatly on the rough beams , polished and gleaming in the lamplight . To him it must seem ghoulish , fantastic as Ali Baba 's cave . You want to tell him it 's a job , and not simply a necessary one , but a last opportunity to care for another person , to serve their family . You get the soldier onto the table . If it were just you , you 'd strap him in and turn the crank so the whole thing would tilt , but the boy 's seen enough for one day . You thank him and he thumps up the stairs . " It 's cold down there , " he says , washing over the basin . " Stays the same the year round . " It 's an old trick , you want to tell him . A hundred years ago the French used it to summer their furs . In the winter you store Friendship 's dead down there , their coffins waiting for the ground to thaw out . You want to tell him about the conversations they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to impress on him how many stories everyone has within them , how much each death diminishes Friendship , especially with the young people leaving . But again , he 's done enough . And he 's young , you do n't expect him to understand . Outside , he lifts your bike over the side of the rig , and you thank him once more before he starts off . Yancey 's mare is gone , but John Cole 's sorrel and buckboard are hitched at Fenton 's . You slip into Doc 's as if for an afternoon chat . The parlor 's empty , in back the sound of water sloshing . " That you , Jacob ? " he calls , and you answer . " I 'll just be a minute . " You slap the dust off your bottom before sitting on Irma 's love seat . You wonder what Doc saw . Usually he 'll take you into his examining room and go over the littlest detail with you , as if you 're a student . Maybe it was starvation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe it , the way the man pitched into the fire . When soldiers go hungry too long , they liberate food . And it 's not like Doc to boss you around . Make sure and wash up good , he said . This is the hard part of being a constable : when it comes to Friendship , you do n't like mysteries . You worry too much . It 's like Amelia 's colic ; you want to be sure it 's normal , that in the morning you wo n't find her blue and motionless in her crib . Doc comes in with his jacket on , his bandage missing . He takes a seat behind his desk without looking at you , leans back and crosses his legs a city thing . He 's frowning , going over something in his mind , and you know not to interrupt . " You say the fellow 's pockets were turned out , " he asks . " Probably his traveling companion . Why , what is it ? " " If I 'm right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you echo , trying it out in your mouth . Endeavor went through an epidemic a few years ago , took half the town . And Montello had that typhus that went through the tannery there , killed all those women . You 'll have to enforce quarantine , burn the dead 's possessions . But of the disease itself you 're mostly ignorant . It kills , that 's enough . " Do n't bother dressing him out , " Doc says . " Just get him in the ground . And be damned careful how you handle him . " " Right . " The two of you sit there a minute in the cool room , pondering what this means to Friendship . Your thoughts refuse to connect , run together like the cicadas outside , screaming in the trees . " Guess I better wire down the line and let Bart know , " you say , but it 's a question . You 're hoping Doc will back off and say he could be mistaken , that the woman 's symptoms could be anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . You think of what the woman said He takes the little ones first . " Yep , " Doc says , half-distracted , and sighs , an admission of failure . " I guess you 'd better . "
