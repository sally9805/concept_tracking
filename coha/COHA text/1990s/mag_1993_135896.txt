Even in the blizzard that threatened to turn last Saturday 's Stagg Bowl into the stag bowl ( fit only for reindeer ) , it was clear that Jim Ballard , the cocky , strong-armed senior quarterback for Mount Union College , just might be as good as he thinks he is . How good is that ? After Mount Union 's 34-24 win over Rowan College in Salem , Va. , people actually agreed with Ballard when he shared this opinion about his NFL potential : " If somebody gives me a legitimate chance , I think I can make it . " // Ballard 's brashness was on display before the Division III championship game too . Last Friday , after a luncheon for the two teams , he found himself standing next to Bill Fisher , Rowan 's 6 ' 3 " , 280-pound senior noseguard . " I felt him staring at me , " says Fisher , " so I looked at him . Then he called me a punk . A punk ! I could n't believe the disrespect. " // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballard once and picking off one of his passes . But it was only a small measure ; the day belonged to Ballard , who completed 28 of 45 passes for 387 yards and three touchdowns and brought the Purple Raiders from behind by directing two fourth-quarter scoring drives . On the second , an 80-yard march , he completed five passes , three of them to his favorite receiver , wideout Ed ( the Plague ) Bubonics , who made six catches for 104 yards in the game 's final 15 minutes . // " During games , I 'm cocky , " says Ballard . " I 'm arrogant , and I talk a lot of trash . But I do n't mean anything by it . That 's just me. " // Ballard plays mind games with himself as well . Two weeks ago , before Mount Union , which is in Alliance , Ohio , won its semifinal game against St. John 's of Minnesota , Ballard got fired up over the news that SI had named St. John 's quarterback Willie Seiler as its Division III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw eight touchdown passes in a 56-8 rout of St. John's. // Six days after his team lost to Mount Union , coach John Gagliardi , who has been at St. John 's for 41 years , presented Ballard with the first Gagliardi Trophy , Division Ill 's version of the Heisman . Said Gagliardi , " It 's a happy coincidence for me to award this to someone who is supposed to be the best in Division III , but it did n't have to be proved so convincingly . In all my years I 've never seen someone dominate a game like that . " // When he graduated from Cuyahoga Falls High , just outside Akron , Ballard did n't receive a single Division I-A scholarship offer . So he went to another Division III school , Wilmington ( Ohio ) College , for a year before transferring to Mount Union . Since arriving in Alliance , Ballard has set 15 NCAA passing records . // You want numbers ? How about 51 touchdown passes and 4,168 yards passing this year before the Rowan game ? Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to northeast Ohio during the last few months to have a look al the 6 ' 4 " , 220-pounder with the cannon ? // The only quarterback to make it big in the pros from a school that 's now in Division III was Ken Anderson , who played for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1971 to ' 86 after graduating from Augustana College in Illinois . Ballard may become the second because of his size , strength and savvy . And do n't forget that ' tude . Ballard says his first goal is to get invited to play with the big boys in a college all-star game . " I 'd love to see how I could do in a game with players from Ohio State and Nebraska and places like that , " he says . // After the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl , Ballard tried to explain that he really had n't meant to insult Fisher by calling him a punk . " I was just trying to intimidate him , get him mad so that maybe he 'd do something dumb and get called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballard. // This explanation did nothing to appease Fisher . However , in displaying some bravado of his own , Fisher paid Ballard a compliment . " Tell him , " said Fisher , glowering as he rubbed the stubble on his chin , " that I 'll see him in the NFL. "
