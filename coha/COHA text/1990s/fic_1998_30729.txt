Exactly ! I 'm putting my daughter 's apartment on the market , and if it 's convenient I 'd like you to handle it for me . " " It would be very convenient , Mrs. Waring . " Lacey made an appointment with her for the following morning , hung up , and turned to Rick . " What luck ! Three East Seventieth . That 's a great building , " she said . " Three East Seventieth . What apartment ? " he asked quickly . " Ten B. Do you know that one by any chance ? " " Why would I know it ? " he snapped . " Especially since my father , in his wisdom , kept me working the West Side for five years . " It seemed to Lacey that Rick was making a visible effort to be pleasant when he added , " From what little I heard on this end , someone met you , liked you , and wants to dump an exclusive in your lap . I always told you what my grandfather preached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people remember YOU . " " Maybe , although I 'm not sure it 's necessarily a blessing , " Lacey said , hoping her slightly negative reaction would end their conversation . She hoped also that Rick would soon come to think of her as just another employee in the family empire . He shrugged , then made his way to his own office , which overlooked East Sixty-second Street . Lacey 's windows faced Madison Avenue . She reveled in the sight of the constant traffic , the hordes of tourists , the well-heeled Madison Avenue types drifting in and out of the designer boutiques . " Some of us are born New Yorkers , " she would explain to the sometimes apprehensive wives of executives being transferred to Manhattan . " Others come here reluctantly , and before they know it , they discover that for all its problems , it 's still the best place in the world to live . " Then if questioned , she would explain : " I was raised in Manhattan , and except for being away at college , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . " Her father , Jack Farrell , had felt that way about the city . From the time she was little , they had explored New York City together . " We 're pals , Lace , " he would say . " You 're like me , a city slicker . Now your mother , God love her , yearns to join the flight to the suburbs . It 's to her credit that she sticks it out here , knowing I 'd wither on the vine there . " Lacey had inherited not only Jack 's love of this city , but his Irish coloring as well  --  fair skin , blue-green eyes , and dark brown hair . Her sister Kit shared their mother 's English heritage  --  china-blue eyes , and hair the shade of winter wheat . A musician , Jack Farrell had worked in the theater , usually in the pit orchestra , although sometimes playing in clubs and the occasional concert . Growing up , there was n't a Broadway musical whose songs Lacey could n't sing along with her dad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a shock . In fact , she wondered if she ever would get over it . Sometimes , when she was in the theater district , she still found herself expecting to run into him . After the funeral , her mother had said with wry sadness , " Just as your dad predicted , I 'm not staying in the city . " A pediatric nurse , she bought a condo in New Jersey . She wanted to be near Lacey 's sister Kit and her family . Once there , she 'd taken a job with a local hospital . Fresh out of college , Lacey had found a small apartment on East End Avenue and a job at Parker and Parker Realtors . Now , eight years later , she was one of their top agents . Humming , she pulled out the file on 3 East Seventieth and began to study it . I sold the second-floor duplex , she thought . Nice-sized rooms . High ceilings . Kitchen needed modernizing . Now to find out something about Mrs. Waring 's place . Whenever possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To that end , she 'd learned that it could help tremendously to become familiar with the people who worked in the various buildings Parker and Parker handled . It was fortunate now that she was good friends with Tim Powers , the superintendent of 3 East Seventieth . She called him , listened for a good twenty minutes to the rundown of his summer , ruefully reminding herself that Tim had always been blessed with the gift of gab , and finally worked the conversation around to the Waring apartment . According to Tim , Isabelle Waring was the mother of Heather Landi , a young singer and actress who had just begun to make her name in the theater . The daughter as well of famed restaurateur Jimmy Landi , Heather had died early last winter , killed when her car plunged down an embankment as she was driving home from a weekend of skiing in Vermont . The apartment had belonged to Heather , and now , her mother was apparently selling it . " Mrs. Waring ca n't believe Heather 's death was an accident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone , Lacey sat for a long moment , remembering that she had seen Heather Landi last year in a very successful off-Broadway musical . In fact , she remembered her in particular . She had it all , Lacey thought  --  beauty , stage presence , and that marvelous soprano voice . A " Ten , " as Dad would have said . No wonder her mother is in denial . Lacey shivered , then rose to turn down the air conditioner . On Tuesday morning , Isabelle Waring walked through her daughter 's apartment , studying it as if with the critical eye of a realtor . She was glad that she had kept Lacey Farrell 's business card . Jimmy , her ex-husband , Heather 's father , had demanded she put the apartment on the market , and in fairness to him , he had given her plenty of time . The day she met Lacey Farrell in the elevator , she had taken an instant liking to the young woman , who had reminded her of Heather . Admittedly , Lacey did n't look like Heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair with golden highlights , and hazel eyes . She had been small , barely five feet four , with a soft , curving body . She called herself the house midget . Lacey , on the other hand , was taller , slimmer , had blue-green eyes , and darker , longer , straighter hair , swinging down to her shoulders , but there was something in her smile and manner that brought back a very positive memory of Heather . Isabelle looked around her . She realized that not everyone would care for the birch paneling and splashy marble foyer tiles Heather had loved , but those could easily be changed , the renovated kitchen and baths , however , were strong selling points . After months of brief trips to New York from Cleveland , and making stabs at going through the apartment 's five huge closets and the many drawers , and after repeatedly meeting with Heather 's friends , Isabelle knew it had to be over . She had to put an end to this searching for reasons and get on with her life . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe Heather 's death had been an accident . She knew her daughter ; she simply would not have been foolish enough to start driving home from Stowe in a snowstorm , especially so late at night . The medical examiner had been satisfied , however . And Jimmy was satisfied , because Isabelle knew that if he had n't been , he 'd have torn up all of Manhattan looking for answers . At the last of their infrequent lunches , he had again tried to persuade Isabelle to let it rest , and to get on with her own life . He reasoned that Heather probably could n't sleep that night , had been worried because there was a heavy snow warning , and knew she had to be back in time for a rehearsal the next day . He simply refused to see anything suspicious or sinister in her death . Isabelle , though , just could n't accept it . She had told him about a troubling phone conversation she had had with their daughter just before her death . " Jimmy , Heather was n't herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worried about something . Terribly worried . I could hear it in her voice . " The lunch had ended when Jimmy , in complete exasperation , had burst out , " Isabelle , get off it ! Stop , please ! This whole thing is tough enough without you going on like this , constantly rehashing everything , putting all her friends through the third degree . Please , let our daughter rest in peace . " Remembering his words , Isabelle shook her head . Jimmy Landi had loved Heather more than anything in the world . And next to her , he loved power , she thought bitterly  --  it 's what had ended their marriage . His famous restaurant , his investments , now his Atlantic City hotel and casino . No room for me ever , Isabelle thought . Maybe if he had taken on a partner years ago , the way he has Steve Abbott now , our marriage would n't have failed . She realized she had been walking through rooms she was n't really seeing , so she stopped at a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September , she mused , observing the joggers on the paths that threaded through Central Park , the nannies pushing strollers , the elderly sunning themselves on park benches . I used to take Heather 's baby carriage over to the park on days like this , she remembered . It took ten years and three miscarriages before I had her , but she was worth all the heartbreak . She was such a special baby . People were always stopping to took at her and admire her . And she knew it , of course . She loved to sit up and take everything in . She was so smart , so observant , so talented , so trusting ... Why did you throw it away , Heather ? Isabelle asked her self once more the questions that she had agonized over since her daughter 's death . After that accident when you were a child  --  when you saw that car skid off the road and crash  --  you were always terrified of icy roads . You even talked of moving to California just to avoid winter weather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at two in the morning ? You were only twenty-four years old ; you had so much to live for . What happened that night ? What made you take that drive ? Or who made you ? The buzzing of the intercom jolted Isabelle back from the smothering pangs of hopeless regret . It was the doorman announcing that Miss Farrell was here for her ten o'clock appointment . Lacey was not prepared for Isabelle Waring 's effusive , if nervous , greeting . " Good heavens , you look younger than I remembered , " she said . " How old are you ? Thirty ? My daughter would have been twenty-five next week , you know . She lived in this apartment . It was hers . Her father bought it for her . Terrible reversal , do n't you think ? The natural order of life is that I 'd go first and someday she 'd sort through my things . " " I have two nephews and a niece , " Lacey told her . " I ca n't imagine anything happening to any of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going through . " Isabelle followed her , as with a practiced eye Lacey made notes on the dimensions of the rooms . The first floor consisted of a foyer , large living and dining rooms , a small library , a kitchen , and a powder room . The second floor , reached by a winding staircase , had a master suite  --  a sitting room , dressing room , bedroom and bath . " It was a lot of space for a young woman , " Isabelle explained . " Heather 's father bought it for her , you see . He could n't do enough for her . But it never spoiled her . In fact , when she came to New York to live after college , she wanted to rent a little apartment on the West Side . Jimmy hit the ceiling . He wanted her in a building with a doorman . He wanted her to be safe . Now he wants me to sell the apartment and keep the money . He says Heather would have wanted me to have it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just that it 's still so hard to let it go , though ... I 'm trying , but I 'm not sure I can ... " Her eyes filled with tears . Lacey asked the question she needed to have answered : " Are you sure you want to sell ? " She watched helplessly as the stoic expression on Isabelle Waring 's face crumbled and her eyes filled with tears . " I wanted to find out why my daughter died . Why she rushed out of the ski lodge that night . Why she did n't wait and come back with friends the next morning , as she had planned . What changed her mind ? I 'm sure that somebody knows . I need a reason . I know she was terribly worried about something but would n't tell me what it was . I thought I might find an answer here , either in the apartment or from one of her friends . But her father wants me to stop pestering people , and I suppose he 's right , that we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to sell . " Lacey covered the woman 's hand with her own . " I think Heather would want you to , " she said quietly . That night Lacey made the twenty-five-mile drive to Wyckoff , New Jersey , where her sister Kit and her mother both lived . She had n't seen them since early August when she had left the city for her month away in the Hamptons . Kit and her husband , Jay , had a summer home on Nantucket , and always urged Lacey to spend her vacation with them instead . As she crossed the George Washington Bridge , Lacey braced herself for the reproaches she knew would be part of their greeting . " You only spent three days with us , " her brother-in-law would be sure to remind her . " What 's East Hampton got that Nantucket does n't ? " For one thing it does n't have you , Lacey thought , with a slight grin . Her brother-in-law , Jay Taylor , the highly successful owner of a large restaurant supply business , had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she reminded herself , Kit clearly is crazy about him , and between them they 've produced three great kids , so who am I to criticize ? If only he was n't so damn pompous , she thought . Some of his pronouncements sounded like papal bulls . As she turned onto Route 4 , she realized how anxious she was to see the others in her family : her mother , Kit and the kids  --  Todd , twelve , Andy , ten , and her special pet , shy four-year-old Bonnie . Thinking about her niece , she realized that all day she had n't been able to shake thoughts about poor Isabelle Waring , and the things she had said . The woman 's pain was so palpable . She had insisted that Lacey stay for coffee and over it had continued to talk about her daughter . " I moved to Cleveland after the divorce . That 's where I was raised . Heather was five at that time . Growing up , she was always back and forth between me and her dad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much older but a very nice man . He 's been gone three years now . I was so in hopes Heather would meet the right man , have children , but she was determined to have a career first . Although just before she died I had gotten the sense that maybe she had met someone . I could be wrong , but I thought I could hear it in her voice . " Then she had asked , her tone one of motherly concern , " What about you , Lacey ? Is there someone special in your life ? " Thinking about that question , Lacey smiled wryly . Not so you 'd notice it , she thought . And ever since I hit the magic number thirty , I 'm very aware that my biological clock is ticking . Oh well . I love my job , I love my apartment , I love my family and friends . I have a lot of fun . So I have no right to complain . It will happen when it happens . Her mother answered the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up the children , " she explained after a warm hug . " And there 's someone inside I want you to meet . " Lacey was surprised and somewhat shocked to see that a man she did n't recognize was standing near the massive fireplace in the family room , sipping a drink . Her mother blushingly introduced him as Alex Carbine , explaining that they had known each other years ago and had just met again , through Jay , who had sold him much of the equipment for a new restaurant he 'd just opened in the city on West Forty-sixth Street . Shaking his hand , Lacey assessed the man . About sixty , she thought  --  Mom 's age . Good , solid-looking guy . And Mom looks all atwitter . What 's up ? As soon as she could excuse herself she went into the state-of-the-art kitchen where Kit was tossing the salad . " How long has this been going on ? " she asked her sister . Kit , her blond hair pulled back at the nape of her neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Martha Stewart ad , grinned . " About a month . He 's nice . Jay brought him by for dinner , and Mom was here . Alex is a widower . He 's always been in the restaurant business , but this is the first place he 's had on his own , I gather . We 've been there . He 's got a nice setup . " They both jumped at the sound of a door slamming at the front of the house . " Brace yourself , " Kit warned . " Jay and the kids are home . " From the time Todd was five , Lacey had started taking him , and later the other children , into Manhattan to teach the city to them the way her father had taught it to her . They called the outings their Jack Farrell days  --  days which included anything from Broadway matinees ( she had now seen Cats five times ) to museums ( the Museum of Natural History and its dinosaur bones being easily their favorite ) . They explored Greenwich Village , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , had lunch at the top of the World Trade Center , and skated at Rockefeller Plaza . The boys greeted Lacey with their usual exuberance . Bonnie , shy as always , snuggled up to her . " I missed you very much , " she confided . Jay told Lacey she was looking very well indeed , adding that the month in East Hampton obviously had been beneficial . " In fact , I had a ball , " Lacey said , delighted to see him wince . Jay had an aversion to slang that bordered on pretension . At dinner , Todd , who was showing an interest in real estate and his aunt 's job , asked Lacey about the market in New York . " Picking up , " she answered . " In fact I took on a promising new listing today . " She told them about Isabelle Waring , then noticed that Alex Carbine showed sudden interest . " Do you know her ? " Lacey asked . " No , " he said , " but I know Jimmy Landi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman . That was a terrible tragedy . Jay , you 've done business with Landi . You must have met Heather too . She was around the restaurant a lot . " Lacey watched in astonishment as her brother-in-law 's face turned a dark red . " No . Never met her , " he said , his tone clipped and carrying an edge of anger . " I used to do business with Jimmy Landi . Who 's ready for another slice of lamb ? " It was seven o'clock . The bar was crowded , and the dinner crowd was starting to arrive . Jimmy Landi knew he should go downstairs and greet people but he just did n't feel like it . This had been one of the bad days , a depression brought on by a call from Isabelle , evoking the image of Heather trapped and burning to death in the overturned car that haunted him still , long after he had gotten off the phone . The slanting light from the setting sun flickered through the tall windows of his paneled office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venezia , the restaurant Jimmy had opened thirty years ago . He had taken over the space where three successive restaurants had failed . He and Isabelle , newly married , lived in what was then a rental apartment on the second floor . Now he owned the building , and Venezia was one of the most popular places to dine in Manhattan . Jimmy sat at his massive antique Wells Fargo desk , thinking about the reasons he found it so difficult to go downstairs . It was n't just the phone call from his ex-wife . The restaurant was decorated with murals , an idea he had copied from his competition , La Cte Basque . They were paintings of Venice , and from the beginning had included scenes in which Heather appeared . When she was two , he had the artist paint her in as a toddler whose face appeared in a window of the Doge 's Palace . As a young girl she was seen being serenaded by a gondolier , when she was twenty , she 'd been painted in as a young woman strolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . Jimmy knew that for his own peace of mind he would have to have her painted out of the murals , but just as Isabelle had not been able to let go of the idea that Heather 's death must be someone else 's fault , he could not let go of the constant need for his daughter 's presence , the sense of her eyes watching him as he moved through the dining room , of her being with him there , every day . He was a swarthy man of sixty-seven , whose hair was still naturally dark , and whose brooding eyes under thick unruly brows gave his face a permanently cynical expression . Of medium height , his solid , muscular body gave the impression of animal strength . He was aware that his detractors joked that the custom-tailored suits he wore were wasted on him , that try as he might , he still looked like a day laborer . He almost smiled , remembering how indignant Heather had been the first time she had heard that remark . I told her not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told her that I could buy and sell the lot of them , and that 's all that counts . He shook his head , remembering . Now more than ever , he knew it was n't really all that counted , but it still gave him a reason to get up in the morning . He had gotten through the last months by concentrating on the casino and hotel he was building in Atlantic City . " Donald Trump , move over , " Heather had said when he 'd showed her the model . " How about calling it Heather 's Place , and I 'll perform there , yours exclusively , Baba ? " She had picked up the affectionate nickname for father on a trip to Italy when she was ten . After that she never called him Daddy again . Jimmy remembered his answer . " I 'd give you star billing in a minute  --  you know that . But you better check with Steve . He 's got big bucks in Atlantic City too , and I 'm leaving a lot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this career stuff and getting married and giving me some grandchildren ? " Heather had laughed . " Oh , Baba , give me a couple of years . I 'm having too much fun . " He sighed , remembering her laugh . Now there would n't be any grandchildren , ever , he thought  --  not a girl with golden-brown hair and hazel eyes , nor a boy who might someday grow up to take over this place . A tap at the door yanked Jimmy back to the present . " Come in , Steve , " he said . Thank God I have Steve Abbott , he thought . Twenty-five years ago the handsome , blond Cornell dropout had knocked on the door of the restaurant before it was open . " I want to work for you , Mr. Landi , " he had announced . " I can learn more from you than in any college course . " Jimmy had been both amused and annoyed . He mentally sized up the young man . Fresh , know-it-all kid , he had decided . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , then pointed to the kitchen . " Well , that 's where I started . " That was a good day for me , Jimmy thought . He might have looked like a spoiled preppie , but he was an Irish kid whose mother worked as a waitress to raise him , and he had proved that he had much of the same drive . I thought then that he was a dope to give up his scholarship but I was wrong . He was born for this business . Steve Abbott pushed open the door and turned on the nearest light as he entered the room . " Why so dark ? Having a seance , Jimmy ? " Landi looked up with a wry smile , noting the compassion in the younger man 's eyes . " Woolgathering , I guess . " " The mayor just came in with a party of four . " Jimmy shoved back his chair and stood up . " No one told me he had a reservation . " " He did n't . Hizzonor could n't resist our hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbott crossed the room and put his hand on Landi 's shoulder . " A rough day , I can tell . " " Yeah , " Jimmy said . " Isabelle called this morning to say the realtor was in about Heather 's apartment and thinks it will sell fast . Of course , every time she gets me on the phone , she has to go through it all again , how she ca n't believe Heather would ever get in a car , to drive home on icy roads . That she does n't believe her death was an accident . She ca n't let go of it . Drives me crazy . " His unfocused eyes stared past Abbott . " When I met Isabelle , she was a knockout , believe it or not . A beauty queen from Cleveland . Engaged to be married . I pulled the rock that guy had given her off her finger and tossed it out the car window . " He chuckled . " I had to take out a loan to pay the other guy for his ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Abbott knew the story and understood why Jimmy had been thinking about it . " Maybe the marriage did n't last , but you got Heather out of the deal . " " Forgive me , Steve . Sometimes I feel like a very old man , repeating myself . You 've heard it all before . Isabelle never liked New York , or this life . She should never have left Cleveland . " " But she did , and you met her . Come on , Jimmy , the mayor 's waiting . "
