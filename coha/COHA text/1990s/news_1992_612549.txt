<p> Dawn approaches with the first MARTA bus lumbering up Stewart Avenue . The sound of hushed voices creeps under the door of the family 's room at Achor Center , a transitional shelter south of Downtown Atlanta for homeless women and children . <p> Lone footsteps tip toward the shower in time with the rhythm of an ever-dripping faucet . An hour later , other bodies are briskly moving about . Women dress and ready their children to go down to the dining hall for breakfast . <p> Since February , the center , at the rear of the United Baptist Church on Stewart Avenue , has been home to Sharon Burleson , 41 , and her three youngest children - Courtney , 14 , Tammy , 11 , and 6-year-old B.J. They have shared two adjoining rooms just down the hall from the communal bathroom on one of the upper floors . <p> The center , which opened in 1988 as a " door of hope " for homeless women , is supported by state and local governments , the Department of Housing and Urban Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-third of their income for rent . For that , they receive a private room , three meals a day and snacks . Outside organizations assist residents with rent , furnishings and other items they need . The center provides a clothes closet to help outfit the women for job interviews , school and job-training classes . <p> A licensed day-care center and an after-school program are provided on the premises , as are a typing room and a laundry room . <p> At 7:44 , Ms. Burleson is still trying to curl Courtney 's hair , while the girl strains to see the " Jetsons " on the family 's TV . A few turns of the curling iron will make it presentable , she says , so that they can get downstairs before breakfast ends at 8 . In the other room , Tammy is sitting on the lower bunk trying to get the hang of a crimping iron . <p> Downstairs , voices echo across the long , hollow room that serves as a kitchen , dining hall and auditorium . Mothers shuffle in bedroom slippers across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pick up their food , and the tables where they eat . <p> Breakfast is cold cereal and all of five minutes by the time the family reaches the dining hall . Courtney gobbles down her bowl of Froot Loops . Her mother settles for a cup of instant coffee . Tammy , as usual , just picks at her food . <p> " Gone and eat ! " one mother shouts to one of her three sons while balancing her baby girl on her lap . " I 'm ready to get out from down here . " <p> Ms. Burleson says it is at times like these that she really misses the little things that come with having her own home . " You do everything on their time , " she says of the staff at the center , whom she views as overseers . <p> Back in their rooms , she peers into a small , round mirror on top of the shelter-owned bureau , putting the finishing touches on her makeup . Near at hand are photographs of her older daughters , her father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with inspirational sayings help brighten the room . <p> An electric fan strains to pull cool air into the stark-white rooms . Tammy and Courtney sleep in twin beds in one room that contains a 20-inch television and a wooden chest of drawers . It doubles as the family 's food pantry , with such items as a bottle of spring water , salad vinegar , diced peaches , salt and pepper , cups , vegetable oil , orange drink mix and a Tupperware container of plastic eating utensils . On top of the container is a vase of dried roses and baby 's breath . A pair of pink-and-white girl 's roller skates hangs from a coat hook on the wall . <p> As she hastens to catch her 8:30 bus , Sharon Burleson leaves her children under the supervision of another mother and tells them to mind until she returns from school . <p> Trouble began with broken marriage <p> Things went awry for Ms. Burleson and the children while they were living in Germany with her second husband , who was in the Army . <p> The marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in Germany , her husband was reassigned to Saudi Arabia , and she and the children returned to Columbia , S.C . <p> Within a few months , the bank foreclosed on their house . No support came from the military , and her estranged husband sent money slowly , if at all , she says . <p> " He was denying us basic necessities , " she says with a mixture of sadness and anger . " I had to get down and pray a lot and cry a lot . Then one day I knew I had to pick myself up and start over . " <p> On the advice of friends , she packed up her kids and brought them to Atlanta . " A lot of people had said a black woman can make it in Atlanta if she ca n't make it anywhere else , " she says . <p> When they arrived in late January , the family stayed first at an emergency shelter before they learned about Achor and moved there four days later . <p> Unlike the emergency shelters , families are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . <p> Getting in is not automatic , however . A social services coordinator interviews women at local shelters to find potential residents for Achor . The women must pass a series of screenings and medical evaluations . The process takes about a week . <p> A woman must be able to learn job skills , must agree to participate in the entire program and must be highly motivated to get out of homelessness . <p> Once admitted to the program , a woman is required to sign a contract pledging to abide by the center 's rules : a 9 p.m. curfew during the week and 11 p.m. on weekends , performing weekly chores and attending " community council " meetings of the center 's residents . <p> Achor 's population fluctuates , but during a recent week , there were 56 residents - 24 women and 32 children . Several of the women attend classes at local vocational and technical schools as well as at the Private Industry Council and the Government Learning Center . <p> Sharon Burleson chose a program at Centers for Innovative Training and Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , word processing and computer literacy . <p> " I did n't have enough confidence in myself and my job skills , " she says . " My goal is employment with Delta Air Lines . " <p> For now , she hopes to find a job that will pay enough so that she and the children can leave Achor . She is spurred on by the changes she is beginning to notice in their behavior . " She Tammy argues more , and that has been kind of hard for me to deal with , " she says . " I 've seen aggressive behavior , outspokenness . . . . " <p> And she 's worried that her children might be growing up too fast . " They know things now they were n't ready to discuss or be exposed to , " she says . " When you do n't have enough space . . . " <p> ' Everyone has to suffer in their life ' <p> It is clear that life in the shelter is hard on Tammy . At Capitol View Elementary School she sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board . Her eyes often are down . She rarely takes them off the book and papers on her desk . At times , she tilts her head sideways and rests it in the palm of her hand . She looks bored , tired . <p> Tammy twiddles her long , dark hair with her finger , then raises her hand to solve a math problem . She almost gives up trying to get teacher Larry Mock 's attention before he calls her name . <p> She answers the question correctly , but Mr. Mock must ask her to repeat her whispered response . <p> It 's the same almost everyday , the teacher says . " She 's withdrawn quite a bit , but she excels in her work . Only in math will she volunteer . I think she 's doing real well . I 've had other children from the shelter that were different . I could n't get them to cooperate . They were mouthy . <p> " As far as her look on her face , I wonder what 's going on with her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina . During the previous school year , she attended at least four schools . She 's lost count . <p> Capitol View appeals to her the least . " I do n't like that school , " she says , noting that her classmates are loud and unruly . " The other kids are always keeping you back from doing things . " <p> She never invites her classmates to come home with her . " I do n't mind telling my friends that I live here at Achor Center , " she wrote in her journal . " As long as they do n't mind , I do n't either . . . . I do n't really talk about it because it does bother me if all my schoolmates knew I live here . . . . They might say something about me . But everyone has to suffer in their life . Everything does n't go right with everybody . No one 's perfect . " <p> ' Just little , simple things ; It 's all gone ' <p> Stress and fatigue , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that faces the local fire station , make it difficult for the family to sleep at night . The strain shows in their faces . <p> On a recent night , Courtney is thumbing through a McCall 's magazine looking at doll ads . She is holding her doll " Tiffany , " who is named after her older sister . At the same time , Tammy is looking at the JC Penney catalog and dreaming about how her room will look when the family moves into its own home . <p> " I want a bed with lots of pillows on it , " Tammy says , smiling as she eyes a canopy bed covered with a frilly pink-and-white bedspread . <p> Lately , though , there 's been one stressful event after another . Ms. Burleson had to file a police report after Courtney ran away . The child was distraught after a promised trip to South Carolina fell through . Then , a woman Ms. Burleson entrusted with boxes of her most treasured possessions before she left South Carolina moved and did n't leave a forwarding address . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get her ex-husband to pay child support . <p> " I 've just been running back and forth between child-support recovery , the food stamp office and Legal Aid , " she says . " I hate to see my children suffer this way . I wish fathers could just see what they are doing to their children . I sweat all night long and toss and turn . " <p> Ms. Burleson says the seemingly endless bickering between women at Achor , the children who run around unescorted and undisciplined , and a lack of privacy and freedom make life almost unbearable at times . <p> " You give up things , " she says . " For instance , it 's summer , and I miss going out on the back porch to have a cup of coffee before the kids get up , sitting out on the porch in the evening . You do n't have that . Most of the shelters are in neighborhoods that are n't safe , so you ca n't take evening walks . Just little , simple things . It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help she has received and tries not to complain . However , she resents the way some shelter providers appear to think all homeless people are carbon copies of each other . <p> " Sometimes the way people approach you , they group us together as one group , like all of us have got the same problems and the same needs , " she says . " I 'm here because I could n't take care of myself any longer . My husband had withdrawn support . I 'm being rehabilitated for what ? I 'm having to live life like I did something wrong . " <p> Through it all , she clings to her mission and her deadline . " I 'm gon na get that job and find a place to stay before school starts again ) , " she says . " I promised the kids . " <p> Postscript : As this article was nearing publication , Ms. Burleson called to say that her mission might be sidetracked for a while . She said she had missed curfew at Achor Center - a rule violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children are now relying on the kindness of friends .
