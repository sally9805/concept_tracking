<p> Six months ago , amid stirring calls for cooperation , Congress set out to investigate financial improprieties in the 1996 political campaign , but lawmakers have barely spoken a civil word to each other since , and the investigation faces a long hot summer of unseemly partisan rancor . <p> " I 've sat here and listened to discussion on both sides of the aisle , " said Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski ( D-Pa. ) , two hours into a House Government Reform and Oversight Committee hearing last week . " It 's a terrible way to start what , quote , should be a ' bipartisan effort . ' " <p> But minutes later , Kanjorski was threatening to block GOP efforts to immunize witnesses , prompting Rep. Robert L. Barr Jr . ( R-Ga. ) to accuse the Democrats of " raw , brutal , partisan threats . " <p> Much of the attention paid to the House investigation and its counterpart in the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee has focused on the sparse information the panels are receiving as they squeeze documents out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled the country or refused to testify . <p> But apart from content , both parties agree that these investigations have already gained perhaps unprecedented notoriety for their almost total lack of bipartisan cooperation and the unrelenting rudeness of the participants in their dealings with one another . <p> The backbiting has , at least temporarily , crippled the Senate investigation , where Democrats refused to grant immunity to several witnesses in part because of an unrelated dispute over subpoenas . And House Democrats say the GOP 's autocratic behavior has killed what credibility their investigation may have had . <p> Whether the friction will cause permanent damage is unclear . Republicans remain more concerned about finding information and getting witnesses to testify , holding that important revelations  --  obtained with or without bipartisan support  --  will trump whatever doubts the Democrats can raise . <p> Meanwhile , however , comity is at such a low ebb in the House panel that Chairman Dan Burton ( R-Ind. ) postponed the June 17 evening hearing because some members did not have the energy to endure hours of dinner-time sniping . Their fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday and lasted six hours . <p> And in the Senate , Governmental Affairs Chairman Fred D. Thompson ( R-Tenn. ) opened his last hearing June 12 with a rhetorical sigh : " Unfortunately we apparently are also gathered here today to continue . . . unedifying squabbles . . . to listen to hollow accusations of partisanship , and to deal with . . . other activities normally associated with a political campaign . " He was right . His hearing lasted three hours , and accomplished nothing . <p> Lawmakers offer many reasons for the ill will , but the starting point , all agree , is lack of trust . The minority does not believe it will be treated fairly , and the majority does not believe its generosity will be met with cooperation . <p> Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes ( D-Md. ) , ranking minority member during last year 's Senate Whitewater investigation , said , " the burden tends to be on the majority " because the majority controls the committee purse strings , the allocation of staff and the tempo of the investigation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has failed this year . In the Senate , ranking committee minority member John Glenn ( D-Ohio ) said June 12 that " I do n't see " a " fair and evenhanded investigation , " because Republicans refuse to issue Democratic subpoenas or guarantee that Republican campaign abuses also will be investigated . <p> In the House committee , ranking minority member Henry A. Waxman ( D-Calif. ) said that Burton , in an " outrageous and partisan grab for power , " had taken unfair control of the investigation through " unprecedented " unilateral authority to issue subpoenas and subpoena depositions . <p> But if the majority carries the burden , the minority must demonstrate its willingness to cooperate . " The way it works is that I will tell you where I 'm coming from , and you tell me what you need , " said Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato ( R-N.Y. ) , chairman of the Senate Whitewater committee . " But you need to be sincere . " <p> In the Senate , Thompson has suggested that minority insistence on targeting Republicans is simply an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats . Many Republicans think the Democrats intend to stall until the committee 's mandate runs out at year 's end . <p> " Give me some indication that you want to be serious participants , " challenged Thompson . " Play it straight and we will do everything in our power to assure you your rights are preserved . " <p> In the House , where the probe can extend into next year , Republicans believe the Democrats are dragging their feet to discredit the investigation . " If this was a judicial proceeding , you 'd be accused of obstruction of justice , " Rep. John L. Mica ( R-Fla. ) told the Democrats at last week 's hearing . <p> " I have been watching with dismay , " said former senator Warren B. Rudman ( R-N.H. ) , whose minority participation in the 1987 Iran-contra investigation is often cited by today 's combatants as a model of comity . <p> " The difference is that there was a good deal of trust in Iran-contra , " Rudman said . " Members on that committee had faith that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act properly . " <p> It is difficult to imagine a scene today like the initial meeting of the Senate Iran-contra committee , when Chairman Daniel K. Inouye ( D-Hawaii ) elevated Rudman from ranking minority member to vice chairman , with all the powers of the chairman . <p> " It was totally unexpected , " Rudman said , and that simple gesture at the outset of the investigation made all the difference . " He was a war hero , and everybody knew him and respected him . I give Dan Inouye the lion 's share of the credit . " <p> That participants do n't feel good about each other today is made manifest each time they talk . Thompson , after a fruitless , two-hour tete-a-tete with Glenn the day before , on June 12 spoke of " a continuation , and in fact , an acceleration , of efforts by the minority . . . to delay this investigation . " <p> An hour later , Sen. Robert G. Torricelli ( D-N.J. ) pronounced himself " genuinely , profoundly disappointed " with the investigation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are obstructing , that we 're not interested in a full and fair inquiry  --  on what basis ? " <p> Also absent is the personal chemistry that lawmakers say is necessary in a highly political investigation . " Human relations are important , " D'Amato said . " You trust the people you know . " D'Amato and Sarbanes agreed that they were able to work alongside each other despite Whitewater 's bitter partisanship . <p> Chemistry may be a source of Senate friction , where Thompson , a relative newcomer , is having a hard time gaining the confidence of straight-arrow Glenn , a national hero and four-term senator headed for retirement . <p> But in the House , familiarity may breed contempt between ideological opposites : Burton , a conservative hard-liner , and Waxman , a renowned liberal . Last week Waxman compared Burton 's tactics to " military dictatorships " who " called their regimes democracies , but provided no democratic safeguards . " <p> In this atmosphere past investigations seem almost like fairyland . Rep. Lee H. Hamilton ( D-Ind. ) , chairman of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joint decision that was n't unanimous . " I think we had a commitment to make it work , " Hamilton said . " It simply takes a will on the part of the key leaders to overcome the partisanship , but right now in the campaign finance investigations that does n't exist . " <p> Hamilton said the seriousness of Iran-contra helped members to cooperate . " You had the presidency of Ronald Reagan hanging by a thread , " Hamilton said . " That focused our minds . I do n't think I would put the campaign finance investigations in that category . " <p> And in the Senate Iran-contra investigation , cooperation was such that the two parties even shared staff , a marked contrast with today 's House investigation , where the Republicans have put their interview transcripts and other materials in a private database that the Democrats can not use . This , a committee source said , was so the Democrats would n't peruse their " work product " and tattle to the White House . <p> Last week Rep. Edolphus Towns ( D-N.Y. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the database , and asked for an investigation . <p> Retorted Rep. Pete Sessions ( R-Tex . ) : " Do what you want with your own computer . You have the money . Go buy your own toys , but quit complaining . "
