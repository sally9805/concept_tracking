He was a very small boy , but the village elders remember him distinctly because his family was descended from a mandarin , the most famous citizen of the humble settlement of Paifangcun until , well , until the very small boy came along . The eminent ancestor had passed the torturous series of civil examinations to prove he was a master of the Confucian classics and thus fit to serve the Emperor in faraway Beijing . And the boy 's forefather did just that , at the very height of empire , when the Sons of Heaven , as the Emperors were called , could afford to sneer at the Western barbarians begging to trade with their Celestial Kingdom . <P> By the time the boy was born , in 1904 , the empire was moribund , preyed upon by the very foreigners it despised . But the boy was remembered not just because he was a good student like his ancestor but because he liked to turn somersaults . He would roll out of his family compound , into footpaths and away into the countryside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And his life would be one of many somersaults : away from home , never to return , over the seas , into politics , into war , in and out of danger , in and out of power , and finally into the role of emperor of a nation that could once again afford to sneer . <P> His name , in the beginning , was not Deng Xiaoping . The eldest son of the county sheriff was given a two-character name that meant " first saint , " perhaps a reference to his father 's Buddhist piety . Only later , in France , did Deng Xiansheng become Deng Xiaoping , the two new syllables a prescient nom de guerre , literally meaning " little peace , " an augury of both tumult and relief . In 1920 , at the age of 16 , Deng left his rural home deep inland in Sichuan for the port of Shanghai . There he learned basic French and won a scholarship for a work-study program in France . " We felt that China was weak , and we wanted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of students . " So we went to the West to learn . " <P> In France he learned to love the game of bridge , developed a passion for croissants and became a soccer fan ; he once pawned an overcoat to buy a ticket for a match . But Deng had landed in a France mired in a deep postwar recession , with few opportunities for a student to support himself with part-time work . He spent most of the next five years working at various menial jobs : arms-factory worker , waiter , train conductor and rubber-overshoe assembler.
