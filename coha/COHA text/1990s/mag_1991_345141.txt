Domino 's founder , Thomas Monaghan , 54 , is known for making business decisions the same way he delivers pizzas : in 30 minutes or less . Monaghan has now made another turnabout , ending a two-year spiritual retreat and firing the four executives he had placed in charge of his empire . Monaghan 's explanation : A heavenly influence directed him to get back into the kitchen . " God will help him find the way , " a Monaghan spokesman told the New York Times . But Domino 's problems are pretty down to earth . Partly because of stiff competition in the pizza-delivery business , Monaghan was unable to find a buyer willing to pay the $1.2 billion he wants for the company . To emphasize his sincerity as he goes back to work , Monaghan said he may shed such possessions as his vintage- car collection .
