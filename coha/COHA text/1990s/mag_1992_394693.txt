Last July a group of astronomers announced the discovery of the first extrasolar planetary system ( see " The First Planet Beyond the Solar System " in the December issue ) . Because the planet orbited a pulsar and not an ordinary star , the discovery was even more startling . Then to add to the drama , another research team announced in January their discovery of a second pulsar planetary system . This team , Aleksander Wolszczan of the Arecibo Observatory and Dale Frail of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory , did n't start out looking for planets around pulsars . They were hunting for millisecond pulsars , neutron stars that emit radio pulses hundreds of times each second . Few millisecond pulsars are known , so the astronomers used the 305-meter radio telescope in Arecibo , Puerto Rico , to search for mare of these objects . The effort , which started in February 1990 , turned up two new millisecond pulsars , PSR 1257+12 and PSR 1534+12 , both of which are different than other known millisecond pulsars . PSR 1534+12 is in a short-period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Study of the strong gravitational forces acting on this pulsar already has helped scientists test Einstein 's theory of relativity . But for most people , the more exciting of the two pulsars is 1257+12 . Wolszczan and Frail found that the radio pulses from this star sometimes appear up to 15 trillionths of a second earlier or later than expected . Pulsars emit radio pulses so precisely that astronomers can measure their periods to a small fraction of a trillionth of a second . Pulses that arrive even one-trillionth of a second early or late are a clear signal that something is different about the pulsar . After carefully evaluating the pulse arrival times from 1257+12 , Wolszczan and Frail thought they may have discovered a planetary system . To assure that the variations were not due to their equipment , they also observed the pulsar with the Very Large Array near Socorro , New Mexico , and found the same discrepancies in the pulse arrival times . Two or three components contribute to the observed variations in pulse arrival times , one with a period of 66.6 days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible third , with a year-long period . The simplest and most likely explanation for the variations is that two or three companions to the pulsar pull on the star as they orbit about it . We often think of Earth orbiting the Sun as if the Sun were fixed in space , but in fact Earth 's gravity also makes the Sun orbit about a point astronomers call the center of mass , or barycenter . Likewise , the pulsar 's companions force the star to orbit about a barycenter . The variations in the pulse arrival times indicate that the pulsar moves around an orbit roughly 900 kilometers in radius with a speed of 0.7 meter per second . From their orbital periods , the astronomers determined the distances of the companions , 0.36 and 0.47 astronomical units ( AU ) . ( One AU is the distance between the Sun and Earth . ) Not knowing the pulsar 's mass , they assumed that it is like other pulsars and has 1.4 solar masses . The mass of each companion could then be found by comparing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finding the companion 's mass this way is like putting two children of different weights on a seesaw and moving them back and forth along the board until they exactly balance . Wolszczan and Frail found that the inner planet 's mass is at least 3.4 times the Earth 's and that the outer planet has at least 2.8 Earth masses . Their measurements are sensitive enough to detect objects with a mass about one-sixth that of Earth . THE PULSAR PLANET THAT IS N'T Hard on the heels of the announcement in January by Wolszczan and Frail came the retraction of the discovery of the first pulsar planet system . Preparing to write a second paper about the planet orbiting PSR 1829-10 , Andrew Lyne of the University of Manchester and his colleagues attempted to refine the planet 's orbit . They added data obtained during the last half of 1991 to their existing data and reanalyzed the entire series of pulse arrival times . While double-checking the analysis procedure , the astronomers discovered an error in the way they corrected for the shape of Earth 's orbit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Proclaiming his " embarrassment was unbounded , " Lyne nonetheless disclosed his error to the scientific community and retracted the discovery at the January meeting of the American Astronomical Society . Instead of criticizing Lyne , the astronomers gave him one of the longest ovations in the society 's history for honesty regarding his research and the courage he showed in facing his peers . His retraction reminded the public that frontier research is difficult and that people make mistakes . The process used by Lyne to analyze pulse arrival times consisted of two basic steps . Arrival times depend precisely on where Earth is in its orbit and where the pulsar appears in the sky . The first step corrected the pulse arrival time for the motion of Earth about the Sun , because Earth 's shifting position can make pulses appear to arrive up to 8-1/2 minutes early or late . The astronomers ' analysis accurately corrected the pulse arrival times for Earth 's motion about an elliptical orbit . However , small errors remained in the corrected arrival times because the pulsar 's position was n't precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulsar 's position . The standard procedure for computing the pulsar 's position assumes Earth 's orbit is circular , because the difference between circular and elliptical orbits does not affect apparent sky positions . After refining the pulsar 's position , astronomers find new pulse arrival times by repeating the first step . They repeat steps one and two until they obtain the desired accuracy in the pulsar 's position . Most pulsars have reasonably precise initial positions so there is normally little correction to their positions . But Lyne and his colleagues needed to apply a large correction to 1829-10 's position  --  7 arcminutes . Unfortunately , the analysis procedure did not communicate the corrected position to the repeated first step . Instead , the repeated first step used the initial position , resulting in improperly corrected pulsar arrival times . Effectively , a small component of the elliptical character of Earth 's orbit remained in the pulse arrival times owing to the uncorrected position . The result was that sometimes the pulses appeared to come 5 milliseconds early or late compared to the constant arrival time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Illustration omitted ) In July Earth was closer to the pulsar ( which appears in Scutum ) than the circular orbit assumed in the second step of the analysis , so the pulses appeared to come early . In October , the two orbits have the same radius , so the pulses arrive on time . But in January , the pulses again appear to arrive early owing to the differences between the true orbit and the assumed circular orbit . Not knowing what the arrival time should be , the researchers reasonably assumed that the changing arrival time represented a variation about an average value . This made the pulses appear to come sometimes early and sometimes late , mimicking the behavior of a pulsar being pulled by an orbiting planet . In retrospect , we see that the astronomers were seeing the pulses arrive early twice a year because of the differences between the actual and assumed orbits . So there is no planet orbiting 1829-10 . But that is n't as important as the impact the short-lived discovery had on astronomy . Astronomers were forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Sun . HOW TO MAKE A PULSAR PLANET Prior to the discovery of pulsar planets , astronomers thought that burned-out stellar remnants like PSR 1257+12 could n't have planets because the supernova explosion that created the neutron star would either destroy the planets or fling them out of orbit around the star . But that assumed the planets were created at the same time as the star . Astronomers now think pulsar planets probably form after the supernova explosion . A millisecond pulsar starts as a binary system with a massive star and a less massive star . The massive star burns up the hydrogen in its core quickly . Depleting its other energy reserves causes the star to contract , which triggers the supernova explosion . The remaining bit of the star 's core contracts until the protons and electrons squeeze together to form neutrons . The new neutron star spins several times per second , emitting strong radiation that slowly evaporates its companion star . Gas evaporated from the companion spirals into the neutron star , which causes it to spin faster . As the companion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eventually spinning several hundred times per second . Recent calculations by Marco Tavani of the University of California , Berkeley , and his colleagues indicate that some of the material from the companion star moves away from the neutron star to form a disk several astronomical units in diameter . Because 1257+12 is about one billion years old , enough time has elapsed for planets to form from its disk . Some astronomers call these " second-generation planets " to differentiate them from planetary systems like ours that formed simultaneously with the star . The discovery of planets orbiting PSR 1257+12 was purely accidental , but it remains the first planetary system found around another star . It will take several more years of observations to verify that the planets really exist and to settle the question about the presence of a possible third planet . Other pulsars may have planetary systems , so astronomers are going to go back and look at their data to see if they may have overlooked any other systems . And theorists will be busy trying to understand what the 3-to-2 ratio of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one nagging problem remains . If astronomers ' ideas about star formation are correct , many first-generation planets should orbit stars like the Sun . Although astronomers have yet to discover such a system , they continue their search , hoping to duplicate the discovery of PSR 1257+12 . <p>                     @x In times of economic downturn , we look for the bright spots in our profession where we can point to what is happening that is positive . For this issue , Valerie Diggs ' move to a learning commons is an outstanding example of what one person with vision can do to change the entire idea of what the best school library looks like when it is transformed . Leaders like Valerie do not wait to get into the center of teaching and learning ; they just move in , especially in this era of digital natives and social networkers . <p> Considering the change in focus in Washington , we look for opportunities and move into the conversations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wireless in the learning commons . We might sniff out funded initiatives that come not only from the Feds but from the state . We get a seat at the table . <p> In a recent interview with the respected author Charlotte Danielson , I asked her how teacher-librarians could move into the center of teaching and learning . She gave some sage advice . " Tell them to talk learning . " What does that mean ? It means that in professional learning communities ( PLC ) we talk the language of reading , writing , math , and science , and give ideas how to boost the PLCs agendas ; not our separate agenda . We make everyone feel like we are there to achieve their aims . Yes , as teacher-librarians we have our own agenda , but we are building twisty soft ice cream cones that swirl out : chocolate with their vanilla and the result is better than if we work separately . <p> In talking to representatives of a major testing service , they told me this : states are asking the companies to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one questions on tests are factual recall . Level two and level three move up toward higher-level critical and creative thinking . If that is the case , then here is a major opportunity for teacher-librarians to just move in . When learners are flooded with information , we co-teach to push higher level thinking as kids go beyond information location to information evaluation , analysis , and synthesis . Every time we do this with a teacher , both adults are moving learners toward test question level three . That is what we do . We just move in , because the essence of information literacy is higher level thinking . <p> Such is the stuff of linking ourselves to achievement . <p> In another recent conversation with some major policy makers , it was clear that the pendulum will now swing from relying not solely on the test but toward a wider view of excellence . That means we are in . It is not just how many books or databases or computers we have . We pride ourselves that in every co-teaching experience , we are raising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us gets an extra pair of hands and ears , a coaching partner and someone who can help differentiate across all types of learners . <p> Tell your stories of moving in . Invite other specialists in the school to move into the classroom with you . Collect student work that demonstrates why those databases enriched the research , the writing , and the deep understanding . Demonstrate how those web 2.0 tools actually pushed learning ; not the fact that you were using technology as " toys . " <p> When everyone else is moaning about the downturn , turn up your conversation about how we can increase learning by collaborating because two heads are better than one . Everyone complains that collaboration takes more time . It does in the beginning , but after a few practices , IT TAKES LESS TIME because the two adults keep building a track record that kids learn more when the two adults get better at it . Repeat after me : Together , we make a bigger difference in learning than either of us could do alone . Say that over three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can push the conversation in the direction of learning . For every faculty member who believes us , we deliver . The word gets out : if you want your kids to do better , co-teach with the teacher-librarian . Count the number of times that happens over the school year and brag and brag and brag about those teachers and their classes and their scores on those higher level tests . It is the only way we are going to survive as a profession . It is our twisty cone strategy . <p> Betty Marcoux detailed much of what we are saying by interviewing winners of the NSLMPY awards from AASL . You can read the results in this issue . Those who excel in our profession move in . <p> Another note about this issue : In the Best of the Best issue each year , our managing editor , Corinne Burton gathers together various best lists for your convenience and as a check against our selections over the past year . We are particularly happy to have Isabel Schon 's article on books in Spanish along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget to check the best professional books of the year against your professional book shelf ' . <p> Now to Treasure Mountain : For 20 years , practitioners and researchers have met at the Treasure Mountain Research Retreat that usually meets during the pre-conference day of AASL . You can be a part of this fabulous experience ( ask anyone who has ever been ) . This year we are asking participants to interview major education writers outside our field about how teacher-librarians can move into the center to teaching and learning .
