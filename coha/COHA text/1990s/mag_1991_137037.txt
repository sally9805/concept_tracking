I heartily commend to your attention any one of three new boxing books  --  Corner Men : Great Boxing Trainers , by Ronald K. Fried ( Four Walls Eight Windows , $21.95 ) ; In the Corner : Great Boxing Trainers Talk about Their Art , by Dave Anderson ( William Morrow , $20 ) ; and Muhammad Ali : His Life and Times , by Thomas Hauser ( Simon &amp; Schuster , $24.95 ) . You will observe , however , that I say , " any one of three , " because to read them all , as I unwisely did , is an exercise in redundancy comparable to attending a festival of Murder , She Wrote reruns . All three books have virtually the same cast of characters  --  trainers Eddie Futch and Angelo Dundee are featured players in each  --  and the same anecdotes . Indeed , Dundee 's story about buying precious time for Ali by complaining to ring officials about a torn glove after Henry Cooper knocked Ali down appears almost word for word in all three . It 's true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perilously approaching overkill , but there 's more than enough Ali material in the other two books to satiate even the most ardent fan of the old champ . So take my advice : Pick one of these and forget about the others , unless , that is , you are partial to twice-told tales . // Of the three , Fried 's Corner Men has the considerable advantage of historical perspective , since not all of his subjects are contemporary . There is a wonderful chapter on Stillman 's Gym in New York City and its pistol-packing proprietor , whose family name , it turns out , was not Stillman . When the elegant Gene Tunney proposed opening the windows in Stillman 's smoke-filled sweatbox , the then featherweight champion , Johnny Dundee , protested , " Fresh air ? Why , the stuff is likely to kill us . " There is also a chapter on the sage but sinister Jack Blackburn , an ex-convict twice accused of murder who nevertheless trained Joe Louis into the heavyweight championship . When Jim Braddock knocked Louis down in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet too quickly , Blackburn offered this piece of between-rounds counsel : " You ca n't get up so fast that nobody in the place did n't see you was down . " // Fried 's is also the only one of these books that is actually written . In his In the Corner , Anderson , the excellent New York Times columnist , merely sets the stage for his subjects with a few paragraphs  --  " When the door opened , the aroma of sizzling chicken sweetened the eighth floor room .... "  --  and then lets the subjects , on tape , take over the narrative . Hauser , the author of an earlier book about boxing , The Black Lights , scarcely goes this far . Instead , he tersely introduces the next in line of his more than 150 speakers and then hands over the mike . It is a book not so much written as recorded . Still , there are good moments on these tapes . One of Anderson 's cornermen , Kevin Rooney , who was discharged by the Mike Tyson camp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin Givens ( the former Mrs. Tyson ) and Givens 's mother , Ruth Roper . And Dundee admits that his advice to Ali in the famous " rope-a-dope " win over George Foreman in Zaire was to stay off the ropes . // Hauser purports to give a balanced account of Ali 's life , and he is thorough in having doctors detail Ali 's ongoing medical problems , but in the earlier chapters , at least , the scales are tipped heavily in the champion 's favor . Ali is variously described in these pages as " the most recognizable person on earth " and " the most beautiful fighting machine ever assembled . " And though dissenting voices are heard later on , the only logical conclusion the reader might reach is that Muhammad was a mountain few fighters of any era could conquer . // That is n't necessarily the verdict some of Fried 's or even Anderson 's old-timers render . Futch , who trained Ali foe Joe Frazier , considered Ali a limited fighter who " did so much with so little .... And his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom ducked , he very seldom blocked a punch .... And he never threw a body punch . " // Mannie Seamon , who succeeded Blackburn as Louis 's trainer , claims that the Brown Bomber " would have whipped Cassius on the best day of Clay 's career . " Ray Arcel tells Anderson that no one was better than Jack Dempsey on the day Dempsey poleaxed big Jess Willard for the heavyweight title . And Charley Goldman , who trained Rocky Marciano , was forever loyal to his man . When some expert would comment after one of the Rock 's KO wins that " Rocky do n't look so good in there , " Goldman would reply , " That guy lying on the floor do n't look so good either .
