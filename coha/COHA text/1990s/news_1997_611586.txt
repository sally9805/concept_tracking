<p> Rebel forces loyal to Laurent Kabila were plotting their attack on the key southern city of Lubumbashi earlier this year when a glitch surfaced in their battle plan : Kabila 's army needed fuel to airlift troops to the town , recalled a Rwandan officer who participated in the operation . <p> They found it at a depot maintained by the U.N . High Commissioner for Refugees in Goma , a Congolese town in central Africa 's Great Lakes region that had already fallen to Kabila 's men . More than 15,000 gallons of fuel were seized to ferry 300 crack troops southward . Within days of the airlift , Lubumbashi was in rebel hands . <p> The fuel theft was just one of a series of episodes that illustrate the central , if unintentional , role the U.N . refugee agency and other aid agencies have been playing in regional crises in the aftermath of the Cold War . Warlords , rebel leaders and imploding governments from Bosnia to Brazzaville now manipulate aid agencies as never before  --  using their food to feed troops , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or occupy vast territories . <p> Nowhere was this manipulation more visible than in the seven-month rebellion that toppled longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and installed Kabila as the president of the country he renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo . <p> Mobutu 's army hijacked U.N.-chartered planes to transport guns for its futile fight against the rebels . Under the gaze of international aid workers , the planes flew into U.N.-run refugee camps where the arms were distributed to Rwandan Hutu refugees  --  former soldiers and militiamen involved in Rwanda 's 1994 ethnic massacres  --  who had become Mobutu 's first line of defense . At the same time , the anti-Mobutu rebel army flew on stolen aid fuel , rolled in stolen aid trucks and grew strong on stolen aid food . <p> As a Western ambassador put it : " The failure of the West to deal with the Rwandan refugee crisis led directly to the fall of Mobutu . " <p> In Congo and several other post-Cold War regional crises , humanitarian action has become a substitute for Western military and diplomatic intervention . Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explosive situations they find themselves confronting . As such , the aid they bring often becomes a resource in a conflict , helping to fan its flames rather than damp them down . <p> The Western reaction of deploying food and money  --  but not troops or diplomatic pressure  --  has , military scholars argue , become an important component in the tactics of these local warriors . It has also given aid workers cause to question two once sacred tenets of their trade : that every disaster deserves a humanitarian response and that aid agencies must remain strictly neutral . This month , Sadako Ogata , the U.N . high commissioner for refugees , announced that her agency was suspending its operations in Congo  --  a decision that highlighted the United Nations ' frustration with its aid missions . <p> " We are being forced to pick sides in crises now , " said a senior official at the International Committee for the Red Cross , whose founding principles  --  that all sides of a conflict be treated equally  --  have been shaken in recent years , most notably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late last year . Indeed , most aid agencies in Bosnia are working openly for unification of the country , in opposition to the separatist Serbs . <p> Aid agencies have been subject to manipulation and intimidation in the past . But the logic of the Cold War often drew American or Soviet advisers to direct and control those conflicts . Today , the U.N . and other aid agencies  --  called non-governmental organizations , or NGOs  --  more commonly operate in a political , military and diplomatic vacuum . <p> " The Zaire crisis signals that our tools are inadequate to deal with these types of crises , and these types of crises will be more likely in the future , " said Lionel Rosenblatt , head of Refugees International , a Washington-based humanitarian advocacy group . " I unfortunately do n't see much hope for improvement . . . . Whole regions will go up in smoke with the international community unable and unwilling to make any type of decisive action . " <p> Rosenblatt said he believes that given the unwillingness of Western powers to get involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only pieces that will be free to move on the chessboard will be the aid agency pieces . That means they will be at the front line of political , security and humanitarian crises for years to come . They will be the substitute for political force , a Band-Aid . But the Band-Aid will only last a certain amount of time before the situation explodes again . " <p> An indication of the extent to which the U.N . refugee agency  --  known by its initials , UNHCR  --  and other aid groups have begun to usurp the traditional role of governments is in their budgets . In 1971 , the total expenditure by disaster relief agencies totaled $ 200 million ; by 1994 , it had ballooned to $ 8 billion , with $ 1.4 billion spent for Rwanda and eastern Congo alone . Today , aid agencies put more money into Africa than does the World Bank , once considered the most influential body involved with that continent . UNHCR expenditures have gone up from $ 544 million in 1990 to more than $ 1 billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is flowing to aid agencies and humanitarian disaster relief at an increasing rate , up from about $ 300 million a year in the late 1980s to $ 1.3 billion today . The U.S. Agency for International Development has pledged to funnel 40 percent of all American aid through these agencies by 2000 , up from 13 percent in 1992 . More than $ 350 million in U.S. funds went to help alleviate the crises in Rwanda and Congo , with much of the money going to NGOs . <p> The numbers of NGOs are also booming . In 1995 , one study counted 28,900 such agencies operating in three or more countries , although many were small-scale outfits . Indeed , of the 170 aid agencies working in Rwanda , one-third were unfamiliar to an interagency team monitoring aid agency activity . More than $ 100 million of the $ 1.4 billion spent in Rwanda and eastern Congo in 1994 could not be accounted for , a U.S. government official said . <p> Another , grimmer sign of how the role of aid agencies has changed is the rising death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief workers operated on the sidelines of conflicts , protected by an invisible shield of neutrality . Now , while no firm statistics are available , it seems clear that several hundred of them are being killed each year . Combatants have come to view aid workers as participants in their wars , and their food , fuel and transport are seen as weapons . <p> Teeming Camps Untamed <p> In the case of Congo , the role of NGOs and the UNHCR not only loomed large in the conflict , but arguably helped spark it . Kabila 's successful bid to topple Mobutu was aided in large part by Rwanda 's Tutsi-dominated government , which  --  as many of its leaders and officers have acknowledged  --  sought to use Kabila 's rebels to eliminate a pressing problem on Rwanda 's western border . <p> In 1994 , the Hutu-extremist government ruling Rwanda tried to eradicate that country 's Tutsi minority . After soldiers , militiamen and ordinary citizens had killed more than a half-million Tutsis and Hutu moderates , a Tutsi rebel force halted the slaughter , toppled the Hutu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rwanda 's borders . About 1.1 million  --  including perpetrators of the slaughter  --  poured into Congo , where refugee camps were quickly built and supported by the UNHCR and other aid agencies . <p> Within weeks , the U.N . agencies and NGOs had allowed Rwanda 's ousted Hutu government to reconstitute itself in eastern Congo , using the refugee camps as a political base . In some cases , U.N . officials and other aid workers actually encouraged Hutu radicals to take control of the camps , reasoning that it was easier to rely on a government-in-exile to distribute aid and keep order , U.N . officials acknowledged . <p> " That effectively is our policy , " a senior U.N . field worker said in Goma . " We always work through governments . Mobutu 's government was nowhere to be found . It was natural to turn to the Hutus . " <p> " All of us were overwhelmed , " recalled Terry Sawatski , head of the Africa aid program for the Mennonite Central Committee , an Akron , Pa. - based charity . " Nobody knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others said that relying on and assisting the gunmen and politicians , instead of trying to separate them from the rest of the refugees , was a terrible mistake . <p> Starting in 1994 , Ogata issued pleas for international military help to separate the killers from the innocents . At one point , her agency even considered hiring private security firms to do the work . But , Ogata said in an interview , the idea was shelved because it was too costly . Ultimately , the U.N . refugee agency hired Mobutu 's Presidential Guard to provide security for the camps  --  a decision that had further unintended consequences once the rebellion broke out . Mobutu used the guard members to lead Hutu refugees on counterattacks against Kabila 's rebels . <p> Mobutu 's guard refused to disarm the Hutus ; thus many of the refugee camps became armed camps , organized to support the radical Hutu leaders in their desire to reconquer Rwanda or at least destabilize it . Military training was commonplace . Weapons purchases were public . Hutus who expressed the wish to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hutu former government even instituted a system to tax the refugees , taking a chunk of international aid material , selling it on the black market and using the profits to enrich itself and buy guns . In one camp alone , the Hutu government generated $ 6 million a year for weapons purchases , a U.S. government official said . Military activities in the camp were obvious , aid workers said ; the politicians and gunmen ate better than the other refugees , strutted around in new sweat suits and held open meetings during which military strategy was discussed . <p> A record of one such meeting is preserved in the diary of Faustin Nsengimana , a Hutu militiaman . The journal , a crumbling , 11-page manuscript stained by the jungle , was picked up by an aid worker in central Congo . In the meeting , held at a U.N.-run camp , Nsengimana writes , he and other soldiers were told whom to kill in Rwanda  --  " the Rwandan government , its soldiers , its ministers and bureaucrats , the people who have wealth in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Hutu extremists were using U.N.- and NGO-run camps as bases to attack Rwanda . But another senior U.N . aid official conceded that Ogata 's agency broke its own rules  --  issued in 1987 and reiterated in 1995  --  that all refugee camps must be demilitarized . The official added that guidelines for UNHCR operations in Africa specify that refugee camps should be sited more than 30 miles away from an international border . But in eastern Congo , the camps were hard by the Rwandan frontier , making it easier for Hutu militiamen to slip into Rwanda and launch attacks . <p> " We violated many of our own rules , " the official said . " And we did n't do what we were supposed to do . We did n't protect refugees . " <p> Faced with this situation , 16 NGOs appealed to Ogata in late 1994 , urging her to deal with the brewing crisis . The NGOs ' statement termed the Hutu refugees " hostages " of the Hutu militias and warned that the " relief operation is unsustainable . " The plea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies were never able to disarm the Hutu militias that controlled the camps , nor could they stop the Hutu gunmen from sneaking back into Rwanda to stage revenge attacks against Rwanda 's new , Tutsi-dominated government . Paul Kagame , Rwanda 's vice president and defense minister , said he planned what became Kabila 's rebellion as a means of keeping the camps from destabilizing his fledgling government . <p> Kagame ordered the rebellion to begin in October because , he said , Rwandan intelligence had learned that the Hutus were planning a major offensive against his country . The rebellion spread quickly as Mobutu 's army crumbled , but the swift success of Kabila 's troops also posed logistical headaches for them . Aid agencies provided unwitting assistance . <p> U.N . officials said Kabila 's forces stole the airplane fuel from the U.N . depot in Goma in March in preparation for their attack on Lubumbashi , a mining center in the south . The fuel was used to ferry 300 troops and their weaponry  --  small-bore mortars and heavy machine guns  --  to the city ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's forces also pilfered scores of aid trucks , which helped improve their transport capacity . In many cases , they did not bother to repaint them , and today gun-toting toughs can still be seen at the helm of blue and white U.N . vehicles in Bukavu , Goma and other Congolese towns . <p> Also in March , Mobutu 's men flew planes  --  chartered by the United Nations and other groups and emblazoned with the insignia of such agencies as Save the Children and UNICEF  --  packed with weapons to the Hutus at the Tingi Tingi refugee camp in central Congo . Many of the guns used in some of the biggest battles of the war  --  around Lubutu , just south of Tingi Tingi  --  were flown in on hijacked aid agency planes . <p> " It made us all pretty sick to see those planes fly in with all those guns , " said Mike Deppner , a Canadian physician who worked with the UNHCR . " It was our camp , but we were powerless to do anything . " <p> After the camps were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies continued to play an unintended role in the war , luring Hutu refugees out of hiding in the jungle with the promise of succor . Many of the refugees  --  not only gunmen , but women and children as well  --  were subsequently slaughtered by Kabila 's men , Western aid officials and Zairian witnesses have said . <p> Looking for Answers <p> The UNHCR is the glue that binds almost all disaster relief operations together . NGOs often undertake projects as subcontractors to the U.N . agency and depend on it to negotiate with host governments . It sets the tone for how work will be done in a region . <p> In the case of Congo , when the 16 NGOs wrote to Ogata in 1994 , U.N . field workers responded by effectively ignoring the NGO call for a different type of aid effort and telling the NGOs that if they left , other aid agencies would be found to replace them , U.N . and aid agency officials said . <p> Three ultimately did leave  --  the International Rescue Committee , the Paris-based Doctors Without Borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign the statement but pulled out in May 1995 for similar reasons . All were quickly replaced . <p> " The humanitarian machinery was running at top speed , and I think that everyone enjoyed that , " said Rony Brauman , the former chief of Doctors Without Borders who made the decision to pull out of eastern Congo . " The problem was that we were bringing massive help to the criminals . All of our resources went through their hands , allowing them to strengthen their power over the refugees . This humanitarian operation was a total ethical disaster . " <p> Roy Williams , a senior vice president of the New York-based International Rescue Committee , said his agency pulled out of a humanitarian crisis for the first time in its 64-year-old history , knowing that the decision could cost lives . " It was a terrible decision to have to make , " he said , " because we were leaving responsibilities behind . Still , the whole aid community has been overtaken by a new reality . Humanitarianism has become a resource . And people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just should n't show up for a disaster . " <p> At the UNHCR , Ogata argued that , unlike other aid organizations , it did not have the option of leaving Congo because her agency has been tasked , since its creation in 1951 , with protecting refugees . She had to keep her agency working despite the horrible ethical dilemma ; if it had left , thousands would have perished , she said . <p> " So long as there were people who had crossed an international border in an asylum situation , I did n't have the freedom to leave them , however complicated the group was , " Ogata said in an interview . <p> Ogata also had attempted to suspend U.N . relief operations before  --  in Bosnia in 1993 . Then , she faced the wrath of Boutros Boutros-Ghali , the U.N . secretary general at the time , and of Security Council nations fearful of being forced to take bolder action in a region that no Western country really wanted any part of at the time . <p> Other aid officials and countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 , Richard McCall , the chief of staff of the U.S. Agency for International Development , made a final effort to address the growing problem in eastern Congo , proposing a plan that would have shut many of the 42 refugee camps and forced most of the refugees to go home . McCall 's unprecedented proposal marked the first time the United States had lobbied to shut down a refugee operation of the size and scale of that in eastern Congo . But Ogata 's agency and some officials in the State Department opposed his plan ; four months later , Tutsis from Congo , backed by the Rwandan army , attacked the camps , sparking the rebellion . <p> " We were channeling resources into all these NGOs , and we turned around and realized that we were n't getting any return from them , " McCall recalled in a recent interview . " Some of us decided that the best thing to do was to get out and get the refugees home . It did n't work . But one thing is sure : We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A senior Clinton administration official was blunter . " The aid agencies make their money working in these camps , " he said , speaking on condition of anonymity . " This is their bread and butter , so they became a champion of the status quo . The NGOs glommed onto the status quo to protect their rice bowl . " <p> Aid agency officials deny they protected the status quo because of money . They acknowledge , however , that they did not adequately warn the West that a crisis was brewing and that they could not handle it alone . " We should have been clearer with the international community , " said Filippo Grande , a U.N . aid official . " We should have presented it options . We should have said , ' Okay , you are asking us to save 1 million people , but be aware these are the political consequences of our actions . ' The worst thing was the awareness that we were creating a monster  --  we saw them bring in arms to set up military camps . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really had no choice  --  it had to stay . But other aid experts say the stark choice between leaving or staying is too simple . Mary B. Anderson , a Cambridge , Mass. - based aid consultant , has studied problems with aid efforts over the past two years and concluded that agencies need to make fundamental changes in the way aid flows into a crisis area . The camps in eastern Congo should have been made smaller and less permanent , she says , without advanced water systems and other amenities ; such businesses as brothels , discos and movie houses should not have been allowed to take root . And the amount of food should have been drastically reduced . <p> " Aid will happen , but we ought to do it right instead of doing it wrong , " said Anderson , who recently authored a well-received pamphlet , " Do No Harm , " which criticizes the aid industry . " The UNHCR and others need to rethink their approach seriously in light of how aid is being used to reinforce conflict . They very often get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid , or we withdraw . ' It seems to me that we have to get far more inventive than that . "
