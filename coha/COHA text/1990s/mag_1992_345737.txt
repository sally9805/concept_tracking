Good chemistry , Paul Tsongas liked to say when asked why he and his rival Bill Clinton got on so well . Clinton would point out that he and Tsongas were the two candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination offering broad , serious economic plans . That was in New Hampshire barely a month ago  --  a lifetime in the compacted nominating calendar . By last week the chemistry had turned combustible as each struggled to define the other in negative terms , an exchange that revealed as much about themselves as each other . <P> After last Tuesday 's contests , the former Senator from Massachusetts and the Arkansas Governor emerged as joint front runners . Bob Kerrey , losing badly everywhere , quit the race , and Tom Harkin 's war chest is empty . Jerry Brown 's narrow win in Colorado will allow him to continue receiving federal matching funds to wage a guerrilla operation . <P> Tsongas ' victories in Utah , Maryland and Washington demonstrated that he could prosper outside New England . Clinton 's big win in Georgia was his first victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a strong position for this week 's Super Tuesday contests . His treasury is the plumpest of all , his organization the most robust  --  and with seven of the 11 contests in Southern and Border states , he has the home-field advantage . <P> Last week 's outcome , however , left Clinton and Tsongas , both cerebral candidates with a strong sense of purpose , scrapping like ward pols . In Florida Tsongas ' best hope in the South , Clinton aired a commercial questioning Tsongas ' commitment to maintaining Social Security benefits . When Tsongas accused Clinton of misstatements and scare tactics , Clinton 's aides distributed a fact sheet showing that Tsongas had in fact proposed an amendment eight years ago that would have frozen cost of living increases in benefit programs for a year . <P> Then a suddenly bellicose Tsongas attacked Clinton personally as a " cynical and unprincipled politician , " a " pander bear " eager to promise everything to everyone . Jetting around the South , Clinton told reporters at a late-night press conference in Nashville that Tsongas was the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Tsongas had belied his image as a " truth teller " by lying about the impact of Clinton 's position on a middle-class tax cut . A Tsongas ad had implied that the reduction would worsen the deficit . Clinton 's plan would offset the loss with a higher rate for affluent taxpayers . <P> But the fact that Clinton 's camp has been striving for weeks to undermine Tsongas ' credibility is testimony to the way the ostensibly cool Clinton is suffering from the pressure of the campaign . The furor over his alleged romance with Gennifer Flowers and his draft status during the Vietnam War nearly sank Clinton 's candidacy . Though he staged a gutsy comeback , neither his campaign nor his image has fully recovered from the trauma . Says his campaign manager , David Wilhelm : " Because of what happened to us , we lost for the time being the aura of the serious , thoughtful candidate . "
