WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU DO N'T LIKE YOUR CHILD 'S FRIENDS // ELAINE SULLIVAN , MOTHER OF LEAH , 5 , RECALLS TWO RECENT playdates in her Princeton , NJ , home with particular dismay : one when Leah 's friend Abbie , age 4 , smeared red nail polish on the keys of her husband 's prize Steinway piano ; the other when her 4-year-old neighbor , Tyler , managed to carve T-Y-L into their wooden tabletop with his fork before his handiwork was noticed . Dealing with our children 's unsuitable friends-or at least , their unsuitable antics-is one of the trickier aspects of parenting . The reasons that certain children are undesirable company for our kids can vary , from their being simply annoying to potentially dangerous . With younger children , whose lives and social calendars are still overseen by Mom and Dad , buddies tend to fall more into the annoying category : those who make too much of a mess or who shriek so loudly that you want to take to your bed in a darkened room . My own children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy in their room and then , when his mother came , feigned ( I 'm convinced ) a tummy ache and got away without cleaning up a single Lego . And the child who-on his very first visit to our home-encouraged my kids to take off all their clothes while his parents and I sat making polite conversation in the next room . FAIR PLAY So what can we do about those friends of our children whose behavior makes our blood pressure soar ? " Refusing to let your child play with someone , or saying you do n't like him , does n't work-it only makes that friend more desirable and you seem unfair , " says Susan Ginsberg , an educational consultant based in New York City , and author of Family Wisdom : The 2,000 Most Important Things Ever Said About Parenting , Children , and Family Life . What 's more , adds Kathleen Mojas , Ph.D. , a clinical psychologist in private practice in Beverly Hills , kids often learn important lessons from negotiating their own paths through certain delicate social situations . " Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . " So you need to trust them and give them some leeway about whom they pick to play with . Kids learn from one another the natural consequences of their behavior . " The first step , experts recommend , is to assess just who is being bothered by the child 's conduct : Is she bad news for your child-or for you ? " My 8-year-old daughter has a friend whose every mannerism makes me nuts , " admits New York City mother Brenda Oldfield . " I hate her high-pitched giggle , her ugly way of eating with her mouth open , and the way she 's constantly whispering to my daughter in front of me . But my daughter adores this kid , and she 's not doing her any harm . So I just try and stay out of the way when she 's around . " Experts agree that when your child 's pal grates on you , it 's up to you to keep your negative feelings in check . " You need to be fair to that friend and realize it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youngs , Ph.D. , a family counselor from San Diego , and author of Stress and Your Child : Helping Kids Cope With the Strains and Pressures of Life . But , says Youngs , " visiting children need to abide by the house rules . " It 's fine for a parent to say to a young visitor who keeps banging on the piano despite requests to stop , " We do n't do that in this house , so you ca n't either . " It 's also fine to tell the child she wo n't be able to come back unless she can respect the house rules . " That also teaches your own child that in someone else 's house , their rules should be followed , " says Youngs . ASSESSING THE RISKS But what about those playmates from hell-the bullies and braggarts , the liars and shoplifters ? Most experts agree that a friendship with a less-than-stellar kid is unlikely to have any lingering effect on your child , if you handle the situation with care . " Parents should assume their child is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may appear , " Ginsberg says . Sometimes a wait-and-see approach works best . Carole Mitchell , who 'd just moved with her family to the Chicago area , became worried when her son , Mark , a studious 12-year-old , started junior high school and befriended Noel , an indifferent student . Carole was called into school to discuss her son 's declining grades . " The teacher made it dear that Noel was the problem , " Carole says . " But Noel was the first friend Mark had made in his new school . I did n't want to stop them from being together , but I did n't want Mark to be led astray either . I was n't sure what to do . " Uncomfortable as she was with Mark and Noel 's friendship , Carole could see that Noel gave Mark a sense of confidence he lacked without his brazen sidekick . She decided to talk to Mark about the need to maintain his grades , without relating it to the friendship . Eventually her instincts paid off . As Mark became more familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear off . Soon , he was avoiding Noel , preferring to catch up on his homework instead . " Mark has always wanted to do well . I could n't believe that desire would just disappear , and it did n't , " Carole says . According to the experts , Carole 's approach was right for a couple of reasons . Not only did she let her child work through the relationship for himself , but she also discussed with him the serious issues it brought up : why it is important to work hard and not let his good habits slip . Ginsberg recommends that parents be specific when they address their concerns . " Do n't just say , " I do n't like him , " say , " I do n't like how Johnny does x , and how the two of you act so crazy when you 're together , " ' she says . " Ask him how he feels about Johnny ; whether he feels he 's being taken advantage of , or whatever . It 's good to get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are some situations in which you should intervene . Violence , of course , is one . No child should be allowed to hurt another , or to encourage someone to be rough or cruel to someone else . " Kids do form cliques and indulge in pack behavior , " says Youngs . " When you come across things like that , you should start teaching your child that such antics are n't fair . " There are some dos and don'ts about getting involved , however . John and Ellen Turner , of Fond Du Lac , WI , felt they had to step in when their 8- and 9-year-old daughters took up with a neighborhood girl who was a habitual liar and who constantly egged the Turner girls on to lie to their parents about where they 'd gone to play . They called the girl 's parents , who became defensive . In the end , the Turners had to end the friendship . Ginsberg suggests that the better approach would have been to present the matter as a shared problem . " Say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( or be disobedient or whatever the situation may be ) , " she says . " Tell the other parent , We should find a solution or keep them apart for a while . ' Do n't make it all the other child 's fault , or the parent will get very prickly . " Sometimes a parent may think it 's best to simply separate the kids , no matter how hard it may be on the children-or the parents . Single mother Linda Marks , from San Francisco , found herself confronting this difficult scenario after she befriended another single parent , Debbie Johnson . Their two 8-year-old daughters , Sophie and Brittany , were in the same class and had become inseparable . Over time , the families began spending a lot of time together , even sharing an after-school baby-sitter . But when Debbie started dating someone , her daughter Brittany changed . " Suddenly , where once the girls were playing with Barbies , now they were talking about boyfriends and kissing games , " Linda says . " That seemed inappropriate for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt I had to stop them from being together so much . " Although Linda was anxious not to hurt her good friend 's feelings , she took steps to gradually separate the girls . She enrolled Sophie in an after-school program , and whenever possible , she avoided getting the girls together . Today , they 're all still friends , but not as close as before . Sometimes adult relationships have to suffer for the good of a child , says Youngs . " If your friendship with an adult changes , that 's a pity . But you have to think about your child 's needs over your own , " she says . As children approach tumultuous adolescence , parents feel they have less control over their kids ' friendships-they may never know their friends ' families , let alone whether those companions take drugs , have sex , or are enticing their kids to lie . It 's a time when parents can only hope that the groundwork they 've laid-lessons about values and positive friendships-will help their children navigate the difficult process of growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affiliation SUE WOODMAN is a freelance writer specializing in social issues .
