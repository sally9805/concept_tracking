Section : Access Parks throughout the country preserve folklife traditions . <p> JUST AS THE WEATHER shapes and forms the land , the environment apes our culture as people adapt to their specific surroundings . From seashores to deserts , America 's landscapes have helped to create diverse cultures , which add to the nation 's richness and vitality .

The following parks are a few of the many that preserve and promote the traditional ways of their people . The continuing pride in and expression of cultural heritages make these parks exciting and dynamic places to visit .
