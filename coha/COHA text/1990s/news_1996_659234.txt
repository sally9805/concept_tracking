<p> He slept through his mother 's murder . Then , the nightmares came . <p> The little boy was tormented by harrowing images of his father - or himself - strapped in an electric chair . He felt he should die . " It was my fault , " he thought , " that my mother was killed . " <p> This was Sam Reese Sheppard 's childhood . <p> On a July morning in Ohio nearly 42 years ago , the 7-year-old was awakened and hustled down the hall past the bedroom where his pregnant mother lay dead , her face and hands bloodied , her skull fractured , her nose broken from a frenzied struggle . <p> His mother 's murder was horrible enough . But there was more : His father , Dr. Sam Sheppard , was charged with delivering the 35 vicious blows that killed Marilyn Sheppard . It was one of the most spectacular crimes - and one of the most sensational trials - of the buttoned-down 1950s . <p> Dr. Sheppard was convicted and imprisoned nearly 10 years before the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless media coverage had violated his rights . A second trial ended in acquittal . <p> The doctor regained his freedom , but could n't rebuild his life . To some , he was the man who had gotten away with murder . His drinking escalated , his medical career collapsed and he died at age 46 . <p> Now , 26 years later , Dr. Sheppard 's 48-year-old son has set out to clear his father 's name . He knows many authorities in Ohio remain convinced the doctor was not a wronged man ; they believe all the signs point to him as the only possible killer . <p> But with new DNA testing techniques , old evidence and a possible suspect - an imprisoned murderer - Sheppard hopes to prove his father was unjustly incarcerated . <p> " This is not just some horrible little homicide that we can turn the rock over and forget , " he says . " Our family does n't deserve to live in perpetuity with this wrongful conviction . " <p> " It 's my obligation , " Sheppard says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Before O.J. Simpson , there was Doctor Sam . <p> The Sheppard case did n't have the glamour of a famous athlete or glitz of California life-in-the-fast-lane , but it had all the tantalizing tabloid ingredients : a murder mystery , a handsome , pipe-smoking osteopath from a respected medical family , a mistress who had sex with him in his green Jaguar , and a brash young lawyer with blazing ambition - F. Lee Bailey , who , 30 years later , stood by Simpson 's side . <p> It sounds like a Hollywood plot and , ultimately , it helped shape one : The Sheppard saga supposedly inspired " The Fugitive " TV series ( later a movie ) . <p> " People have made millions of dollars , literally , over the bodies of my dead loved ones , " Sheppard says with an edge to his voice . <p> These days , Sheppard , a Buddhist , anti-death penalty activist and unemployed dental hygienist , lives sparely in a rooming house in this California community . A bachelor with closely cropped sandy-graying hair , blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark clothes , he has long resigned himself to his notorious name . <p> " I never have and never will deny the connection , however much it hurts , " he says . At times , he notes , people have blurted out : " Are you the doctor who killed his wife ? ... It has made it extremely difficult socially over the years . " <p> But he has gone public to lobby for his father in a legal campaign waged 2,150 miles away in a Cleveland court ; the Sheppards had lived in suburban Bay Village . <p> Sheppard 's attorney , Terry Gilbert , has won court permission to examine old files , autopsy reports , hair and other evidence and is focusing on one suspect : Richard Eberling , a murderer who washed windows in the Sheppard home . <p> " Our main goal is to exclude Dr. Sheppard as the perpetrator of the crime , " Gilbert says . <p> He hopes to use DNA techniques not available 42 years ago to test a single drop of blood preserved from the crime scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Eberling . <p> Police never typed the trail of blood at the scene , but a defense criminalist at the second trial testified the pattern of the drops fit a bleeding person - not drops from a weapon or clothing . Dr. Sheppard had no open wounds . <p> What makes this quest unusual is that a top member of the Cuyahoga County prosecutor 's office - which tried Dr. Sheppard twice - believes the doctor was innocent . <p> " I do n't think he killed his wife , " says Carmen Marino , an assistant prosecutor . " He was not prone to violence . You 'd have to believe ... he batters his wife to death in the room next to where the child is sleeping . That 's asking a lot . " <p> Despite that , Marino 's office opposes Sheppard 's claims . <p> " It 's too old to make a conclusion , " he says . " I do n't think there 's enough evidence to declare anybody innocent . " <p> If a judge declares Dr. Sheppard innocent , his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongful incarceration . <p> But others believe that 's highly unlikely . <p> " There is n't anything that prosecutors have n't known for 30 , 40 years , " says David Doughten , a Cleveland attorney for Eberling , who declined to be interviewed . <p> Doughten says Eberling did not kill Mrs. Sheppard ; he argues the son 's campaign is a ploy to drum up interest in a book he recently co-authored . <p> " This is preposterous , " the attorney says . " It 's good for publicity . " <p> Ohio Judge Michael Corrigan , whose father , John , prosecuted the second case and now suffers from Alzheimer 's disease , agrees . <p> " This case has been visited and revisited every four or five years since 1954 , " Corrigan says . " From the perspective of access , motivation , ability ... coupled with physical evidence , overwhelmingly there 's no question who committed the murder . " <p> Sam Reese Sheppard , called " Chip " as a boy , still has fond childhood memories : learning to swim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the beach of Lake Erie , in back of their Dutch Colonial home atop a bluff in Bay Village . <p> All that was shattered Independence Day 1954 , with his 31-year-old mother dead and his father the suspect . <p> His father told police he had been napping downstairs in the pre-dawn hours when he heard his wife 's desperate cries - " Sam ! Sam ! " He said he ran up the stairs and was knocked out from behind . When he came to , he said , Mrs. Sheppard was dead , her pajamas were pulled above her breasts and below her knees . <p> After hearing a sound downstairs , the doctor said he saw a figure running toward the lake , gave chase and struggled with the man until he was knocked out again on the beach . He described the assailant as a " bushy-haired intruder " - which later became a one-armed man on " The Fugitive . " <p> Police were suspicious : There were no signs of forced entry , the doctor was n't wearing a T-shirt he had on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test and he was caught lying about an extramarital affair . <p> The media pounced fast with accusatory headlines : " Quit Stalling - Bring Him In , " " Why Is n't Sam Sheppard In Jail ? " " Getting Away With Murder . " <p> His son , who had moved in with an aunt and uncle , was shielded from much of that - he did n't even attend his mother 's funeral to avoid cameras in his face . But he still remembers catcalls in school and elderly women " who would just grab this poor little orphan waif and cry and slobber over me . " <p> Dr. Sheppard 's nine-week trial captivated the nation as prosecutors tore into his vague account . The coroner said Mrs. Sheppard probably was killed with a surgical instrument , but none was ever found . And there was conflicting testimony about whether Dr. Sheppard 's wounds were superficial - and self-inflicted - or serious . <p> He was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison . <p> Within less than a month , he faced even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his father died . And in 1963 , Marilyn Sheppard 's father fatally shot himself . <p> Dr. Sheppard served nearly 10 years in prison before a judge freed him , saying he was denied a fair trial . <p> Two days later , he married a flamboyant German divorcee he had been corresponding with while in prison , whose stepsister was married to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels . <p> Two years later , in 1966 , the Supreme Court ruled Dr. Sheppard 's trial was tainted by " massive , pervasive , prejudicial publicity " and that the news media created a " carnival " atmosphere in court . <p> Jurors , for example , were not sequestered and there were numerous false media reports , including one by Walter Winchell that a woman arrested in New York was Dr. Sheppard 's mistress and had his illegitimate child . <p> In his second trial , Dr. Sheppard , represented by Bailey , was acquitted . <p> But prison had taken its toll . <p> " He walked and talked and dressed like a convict , " his son recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought in kind of devious ways . " <p> Still , he says , father and son sustained one another . <p> " Dad would not have survived if he had n't had a son , " he says . " If he had been executed , certainly I would n't have survived . " <p> Dr. Sheppard fought to win his medical license back , but soon there were malpractice suits , a failing marriage and , in the end , a shabby practice in a motel . <p> " It was just kind of a cruel joke , " Sheppard says . " He knew a lot of people were just seeing him as some curiosity . " <p> Dr. Sheppard , who began drinking heavily , took up wrestling , adopting the name ' Killer Sheppard . ' <p> " That was kind of an act of despair , cynicism , " says his son , who recalls his father visiting him in college in Boston , his life 's possessions jammed in a car . <p> " I wished that I could offer him to move in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just so notorious and brought in so much heat that we really could n't live together . That was excruciating . I reached the point where I had to protect myself from him for my future . " <p> Shortly after , his father told him : " ' I 'm going to be dead soon . I do n't have anything to live for . ' " <p> " I agreed , " Sheppard says . " His self-respect was gone . His spirit was finally broken . " <p> Sam Holmes Sheppard died in 1970 . His son did not attend his funeral , to avoid the media 's " shark frenzy . " But he visited his gravesite later . The initials V.Q.P. - Latin for Vincit Qui Patitur - are etched on the tombstone . Father and son had signed their letters to each other that way . <p> It means " He Who Endures Conquers . " <p> A single drop of blood on a wood chip taken from the third basement stair . <p> Chisel marks on a door . <p> A murderer with detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a journalist who co-authored " Mockery of Justice : The True Story of the Sam Sheppard Case " with the doctor 's son , thinks these are pieces of a puzzle that could vindicate him . <p> Ms. Cooper accumulated 20 cartons and 2,000 computer files of material in six years of research . She and Sheppard also enlisted the help of AMSEC , a private Virginia-based investigative agency that interviewed witnesses and prepared a 170-page report that concluded Eberling was the No. 1 suspect . <p> " The evidence can only point you toward him , " says Don Lowers , AMSEC 's chairman . <p> It 's true Richard Eberling has a troubled past . <p> In 1989 , he was convicted of murdering and forging the will of Ethel Durkin , a wealthy widow who left him about $ 750,000 . Her 1984 death was ruled an accidental fall but , after her body was exhumed , it was determined she had been struck in the head . <p> In a strange twist , one of Mrs. Durkin 's sisters was beaten to death in bed - similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ms. Cooper conducted 10 interviews and exchanged dozens of letters about the Sheppard case with the imprisoned Eberling . " He started making a lot of bizarre statements indicating he had pretty personal knowledge about the murder and details other people did n't have , " she says . <p> He once told her : " The Sheppard answer is in front of the entire world . Nobody bothered to look . " <p> Ms. Cooper says he also told her the murderer was a woman Mrs. Sheppard knew - the same story he told Sheppard 's son when they met in 1990 . <p> Doughten scoffs at his client 's accounts . " He 's an old guy , " the lawyer says . " He loves the attention . " <p> But this is n't the first time Eberling 's name has surfaced in the murder . He was questioned in 1959 when he was arrested for stealing jewelry from homes , including rings identified as belonging to Marilyn Sheppard . It was determined they were taken from the home of Richard Sheppard , the doctor 's brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his finger and dripped blood at Sam Sheppard 's home while washing windows four days before the murder . He passed a lie detector test . ( Ms. Cooper says the validity of that test was discounted in the late 1980s . ) <p> One of Eberling 's workers also contradicted his story , telling Dr. Sheppard 's son in 1990 that he - not his boss - washed windows at the home that day . <p> Even if scientific tests determine Eberling 's blood matches the spot on the wood , Doughten , his attorney , says that proves nothing because the evidence was in the Sheppard family 's possession for decades and there 's no way to determine it was n't contaminated . <p> " No court is ever going to admit this , " he says . <p> But Ms. Cooper says this case does n't turn on blood alone . She says a source gave her a police report the defense did n't receive originally that suggested a fresh tool mark on the basement door at the Sheppard home - contradicting the prosecution argument that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also told an AMSEC investigator Mrs. Sheppard had caught Eberling trying to steal . <p> Marino , the current prosecutor , rejects suggestions authorities botched the investigation , but says " there was too much pressure on them to focus on one person only . Other suspects that would be looked at today were ignored . " <p> As for Eberling , Marino says his " mental aberrations certainly make him a strong suspect . " <p> Though Marino believes Dr. Sheppard was innocent , many authorities still believe his original conviction was warranted . <p> Corrigan , son of the former prosecutor , says it does n't make sense that Dr. Sheppard would struggle with his window washer and not recognize him or that an assailant would run onto a beach . <p> " In order to believe this theory , you have to come to their conclusion that Richard Eberling has to effect his escape by swimming to Canada , " Corrigan says . <p> He also doubts an intruder could climb the stairs undetected right next to where Dr. Sheppard slept . ( His son says his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder clearly was a " crime of passion " - corresponding with a marital squabble - not greed , befitting Eberling 's burglary pattern . <p> Corrigan says he resents implications that his father tried to prosecute an innocent man , though he understands - and even respects - Sheppard 's efforts . <p> " The guy 's a pitiful soul , " Corrigan says . " I feel nothing but empathy for him . ( Dr. ) Sam Sheppard not only ruined his life - he killed his wife - but he also ruined his son 's life . " <p> Sam Reese Sheppard is consumed by two causes : fighting for his father and protesting the death penalty . <p> Last year , he walked 1,600 miles from Boston to New Orleans to protest capital punishment . He also works with activist groups , including Amnesty International and the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty . <p> Though he finds purpose in his work , his life will forever be shaped by that summer night four decades ago . <p> " People talk about closure and healing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull . I lost my mother and my father and that 's not going to go away . ... The pain and the anguish is n't going to go away . I 'm not going to miraculously get up tomorrow some kind of whole person . " <p> Sheppard thinks a solid case has been built to prosecute Eberling , though he wo n't go as far as saying the convict killed his mother . And while he thinks the evidence already demonstrates his father 's innocence , he wo n't predict the outcome of his legal challenge . <p> " I do n't invest my emotions in that kind of hope anymore , " he says . " We 've been disappointed again and again in terms of trying to discover the truth . I have to live for today and accept what 's here today and see how it goes .
