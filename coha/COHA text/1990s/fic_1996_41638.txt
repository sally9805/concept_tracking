Where did I get the idea for this picture ? It was the year of El Nino-the current , I mean , and not anything else that I knew about at the time-and the meteorologists were telling us to expect strange events in the atmosphere . <p> They did n't say anything about events at home , where it had n't been good between me and my housemate , Gary , for nearly a month now , ever since one of our late-night script sessions turned into a mistaken encounter in my bedroom . Still , except for the color of the sky-low clouds , smog , the kind of weather we do n't usually advertise , especially when it comes in the middle of summer-it was kind of lovely outside that afternoon , warm , with an inviting breeze blowing up over the bluffs from the ocean . It was that same wind that pushed all the crappy air back up against the mountains east of the city , and when you drove up to the top of the road and looked down in our direction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow scrim that someone had tacked up over the hills . From that hilltop , I wound my way down into the adjoining neighborhood and threaded the car along through four or five more all the way to the mall . I did n't like driving the freeways much , because I always thought of Joan Whatshername 's heroine Maria , played by Tuesday Weld , and the way she drove and drove . That 's how you get out here-probably all over America , since I do n't feel much different about it than I did when I was living in Illinois-seeing life in terms of movies . Or a better , more truthful way to put it , seeing life as a movie . What else was I supposed to believe when I pulled into a parking space at the mall and who should drive up alongside me but my favorite actress friend Bunny ? <p> " Yo , Bee , " she said , rolling her window all the way down . She was wearing shades and had bound up her long hair in a snooda sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette . I had n't seen her since Gary and I had gone to one of those chamber music evenings over at Milt Markowitz 's . I think she had been going out with the viola player . I remember saying to Gary , That girl looks like my little sister , Harriet-except Bunny could never live in the Chicago suburb where Harriet and her banker husband have settled , with two kids , a dog ( though no cat ) , and a little behind-the-house pond with a rowboat-but Gary was too busy flirting with the viola player himself to pay much attention . <p> " So , you ready for it ? " Bunny said , puffing out some smoke from between her teeth in that schoolgirl way-what a schoolgirl ! - that Gary had said , correctly , was so right for the part of Harmon Root , the runaway rich girl in the carnival story we were pitching . <p> I beeped shut my car and slouched over to Bunny 's window , leaning over the way you see the CHPs do on the freeway when some poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabanne-twisted my nose into a knot . <p> " Ready for what ? " <p> " Our big dinner tonight " Bunny said . I looked blank . " You do n't remember ? Roger and Balu Maginnes ? " <p> " Shit , how could I have forgotten that ? But I did ! " What ? Was I crazy , or just depressed ? Roger and Balu were n't a pair whose invitations you took lightly-the big bald producer with the drop-dead beautiful actress wife was how I first noticed them at the evening at Milt 's house , and I remember that my heart started to flutter when I got introduced to them . <p> " I 'm amazed Gary did n't say anything , " Bunny said as I pulled back from her window and looked around at the gray-orange sky . <p> " He was lost in his new cowboy script , " I said . " Showdown at the Gay Corral . I 'm the one who should have remembered . Our big chance to pitch the carnival story again ! We thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself something to cheer you up , and we 'll charm them tonight . A nice shirt , maybe . That 's my thing when I 'm down . A shirt . Or maybe a scarf ? I do n't know you that well , Bee . Are you a scarf chick ? " <p> " No , " I said . " I 'm a cat person . When things get tough , I go and buy something for my Meow . " <p> " I 'm glad you like animals . " <p> " You are ? Why ? " <p> She gave me a mysterious smile and said she 'd see me tonight , and with a little wave drove off . <p> I walked slowly across the lot , a vast metal beach of gleaming sports cars and sedans , and wandered along the walkways of the mall , strolling from shop window to shop window-the leather dresses , velvet coats , platinum-rimmed eyeglasses , gloves made from the skin of antelope , emeralds and rubies in the most bizarre settings , ropes of pearls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice bar , drank a papaya smoothie for lunch . There was a pet store , of course , so I went in and bought a little bag of catnip on a string . Then I found another shop , where the brightly lighted window was filled with stuffed lambs , rabbits , and bears . Like a sleepwalker , I made a purchase . <p> Then I drove back the way I 'd come , the blue blaze of ocean on my horizon , the urine-colored curtain of smog behind me , and this sort of gave me hope , though for what exactly I could n't figure . <p> I wanted to share my good feeling with Gary when I got back , except that he had gone out , saying in a note left on the front table that my mother had called . <p> I took out the little gift for Meow , and tossed her the bag on the stick . It did n't take but a few seconds for her to begin tearing around with it on the rug , crazed with the scent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , I dialed my mother 's number . <p> " I called you earlier , " she said after picking up on the first ring . <p> " I got the message , Mom . " <p> " It should n't always be my call that makes you call me . " <p> " I 'm just a wayward daughter , " I said . <p> " Do n't talk that way , Bee . If you say something , you could make it happen . " <p> " That 's sort of a primitive way of thinking , Mom . " <p> " I do n't know what you 're talking about . Tell me , have you been getting around ? " <p> " Getting around ? " <p> " Have you been meeting any nice young men ? " <p> I held the receiver at arm 's length . Outside the window , a stray gull swept from the beach on a lifting wind . It swooped past our orange tree and disappeared at an angle into an otherwise empty sky . <p> " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because I stay home and work . With Gary . We- " <p> " Friends are friends , Bee , " she cut in , " but I do n't have to tell you that you 're not getting any- " <p> " Younger ? " <p> " If you 've heard me say this often enough to know it by heart , then you ought to know enough to believe it by now . I do n't mean to nag , darling , but just woman to woman , I have to tell you that when you get to my age , you wo n't be able to look back on your work and get much comfort from it . " <p> I took a deep breath . " You 're right . I should have some children that I can call on the phone and make miserable because I 'll be alone and pissed off at- " <p> " Please do n't speak to me that way , Bee . " <p> Another breath . " I 'm sorry . You do n't bring out the best in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , tell me , then , have you seen any movie stars lately ? You 're always telling me about seeing people like that at lunch . " <p> " You just shut off one thing and pick up another ? " <p> " I thought you wanted me to stop talking about the other thing . " <p> " I just want to have a talk with you , Mom . In a pleasant way . You know , like , How are you ? ' and How was your day ? " ' <p> " Family is n't always pleasant in that way , Bee . " <p> " So why do you want so much for me to start one ? " <p> I could hear my voice sail into the highest register . <p> I was still close to tears when Gary came in the door . He was wearing his usual jeans and thin T-shirt with his cigarettes rolled up in the right sleeve . But despite that tough-guy stuff and his wispy mustache , he had that little-lost-dog look . <p> " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meow came tearing through the room with her catnip ball , did a roll , a leap , and another roll , tossing the ball of herbs and then catching it again before it came to a stop . <p> " My big purchase , " I said . <p> Gary looked puzzled . " Did you call your mother ? " <p> " That 's why my eyes look red . " <p> He came and peered into my face . " Ah , so .. <p> I rubbed my nose with my fist and turned away . <p> " At the mall ? " I said when I looked back at him . <p> " Uh-huh ? " <p> " I saw Bunny . " <p> His tongue slipped out from between his teeth , the way it does when he 's working on a line of dialogue and you know even before it comes out that it 's going to be a snapper . <p> " Oh , my God , that 's so dumb ! I just remembered ! But I ca n't go . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at each other when the telephone rang . <p> It was Bunny . " Better wear pants , " she said . <p> When I hung up , I turned to Gary . <p> " Did you know ? " <p> " Know ? Oh , about the ride ? " <p> I nodded . <p> " Yeah , " he said . " I mean , I knew , but then I forgot about it . Look , Bee , if you want me to go with you , I 'll break my engagement " <p> I shook my head . " I can do it myself . I just need to rest , " I said . " Before I go . " <p> And so I left him standing there-not a very nice thing , but it was what I thought I had to do . I went into the bedroom and lay down , feeling a little dizzy at the thought of what was to come . There 's one thing Prozac does , though . No dreams . At least not for me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The next thing I knew , Meow was purring furiously in my ear . I sat up to see the sky outside turned to lavender and fading crimson . " Hi , little puss , ' I said , a croak in my throat as I ran my fingers along her long back . It was late , I was sweating , but it was n't the middle of the night , so I could n't just turn over and go back to sleep . So I hauled my butt out of bed and dragged myself into the shower . In just thirty minutes , I was driving down the Ventura Freeway , heading south . The traffic began to slow , and I thought to myself , Oh , girl , here it comes , this is why I hate these roads , and then I saw the orangey flickering on the horizon and figured that someone else had bigger troubles than mine . After the next curve , I could see the dance of fire on the other side of the road , lower than the palm trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Two cars were burning like slabs of meat on a grill , and the small auxiliary fire truck that had pulled up alongside them was n't doing much to put out the flames . Inching along on my side of the freeway , those of us moving away from the accident could see the rolling lights and hear the wavering whine of more engines approaching . God help the passengers if they were still inside ! I rolled down my window and tried to look back , but our lane was moving too fast now to do more than get a good whiff of the fire . It stayed with me all the way to the restaurant , Cactus Cantina , in Burbank , surrounded on either side by stables , dark animals milling about in the corrals , steeping the air around the place with odors different from the rest of the city . <p> Two rows of faces greeted me inside the restaurant . There was Bunny , sitting alongside Roger and his beautiful blond wife . A half-dozen other couples I did n't know and Milt Markowitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to say you were going to be late . So I had the idea we could play the old switcheroo , " Milt spoke in that appealing Long Island nasal voice of his . " I 'm not into punishment , and I do n't know if I can make it back . " <p> Seeing my puzzled expression , Bunny piped up , " Milt rode with us , but he 'll drive your car home for you and take a taxi from there if you ride his mount back over the mountains : ' <p> " I love what she said . My mount ! My mount ! I love that word ! " Milt looked up at the papier-mache pinatas dangling from the ceiling . <p> " When you did n't show at the stables , " Bunny said , " I gave up on you . I 'm glad you remembered the restaurant . " <p> " Me , too , " I said , noticing that Roger Maginnes was smiling up at me while his wife dabbled with her spoon at some dessert . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " I love that word . My mount ! " He paused and took a breath . " Except I had a saddle with teeth and it chewed up my tuchas . " <p> " The white Rabbit , " I said to him enigmatically as Maginnes 's wife looked over at me and I turned away to dig in my bag for the keys . <p> " The bronze-colored mount , Milt said and lifted the keys from my hand . <p> Next thing I know , people are pushing back from the table , tossing their napkins onto their used dessert plates , and Roger Maginnes is saying at the top of his voice , like a character in a picture he 's much too subtle to make , " Troop , mount up ! " I 'd missed dinner . <p> In the corral behind the restaurant , I met my mount , a chestnut mare named Madonna . As the groom held her reins , I stared at her in the light of the spots above the stable doors , feeling her edgy vitality under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went a little weak in the knees from the pungent power of her smell . The young Mexican groom motioned for me to mount , and as I hoisted myself into the stirrup , I felt his hand pushing up on my ass , and then I was sitting high in the dark , the big animal twitching menacingly beneath me . Roger Maginnes pulled up alongside me sitting atop a huge black gelding . <p> " You 've done this before , right ? " <p> " At Honey Cartwright 's house every summer when I was a girl , " I said , watching as his horse shimmied sidewise and then jerked away forward , but not before I caught a glimpse of the round white globes of the gelding 's eyes . <p> Honey ! I had n't thought of her in years , her big house north on the lakeshore , what we used to do after dark with the black grooms from the deep-city neighborhoods . Grooms ! It never occurred to me until now what richness lay in that word ! <p> The other horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved with a clatter out of the corral . <p> " Troop ! Foh-ward ! " <p> " Roger , " I called after him into the dark beyond the gate , " you should make a western ! " <p> Now , if you have ever wondered-and I myself certainly had n't before this evening  --  just how a posse of folks on horseback would take a ride across Los Angeles , here is how you do it . The first thing is you cross the freeway , and you do this by means of a long dusty trail that curves away from the stables and declines gently toward the racing lights and roaring vehicles on the road and then ducks beneath the road into a long tunnel swirling with dust and clanging with the rebounding sounds of hoofbeats . This was our first ten minutes , and my mouth clogged with the thick choking clouds we kicked up as we moved along with only the faint glow of arc lamps at the far end . <p> Coming out of the tunnel was like coming up for air after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snorting along with the horses and giving myself over to the batting rhythm of Madonna as she chugged along , bouncing me mercilessly in the saddle . I looked ahead for Roger , but all I saw was the huge rump of his mount as he and a couple of other riders took advantage of the flat stretch between the road and the hills to make their horses race . <p> " Hey-yo ! " Voices drifted back to me over the clatter of the hooves . And then we began climbing . <p> " It 's beautiful , " I called out near the crest of the trail , catching up with Bunny , who bounced along smartly atop a broad bay mare . <p> " You having fun ? " she said . <p> " I 'm having a ball . " <p> Roger just then turned his horse back toward us , and in the faint glow of the quarter moon , I could see a strange smile pass across his face . <p> " There 's that , and there 's that , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up alongside me . He pointed up at the sliver of moon and then at the trail that opened into a field of odd machines and smoking pipes poking out of the ground . <p> " What is that ? " I said , staring at this weird landscape . <p> " Methane farm , " he said . " These hills were built up out of garbage . As it decays , it gives off methane gas . " <p> " We 're riding across mountains of garbage ? " I watched now with fascination at the little puffs of smoke that burst from the ends of the buried pipes . <p> " You got to look at it another way . It 's all a metaphor , " he said . I 'd never heard anyone in the business , except for Milt , talk about anything like it was poetry . " They pile it on here , and it makes a mountain , and then we ride over it and catch the view . I mean , look at that down there , Bee : ' Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast ocean of illumination below us . Whatever he meant by what he said , I could n't take my eyes off that luminescent plain fluttering with bursts of bright lights here and there-in which somewhere that fire I saw on the way over or another fire in another part of the city or a fire that would burn before I knew it was adding to the glow . Our horses held fairly still , only their occasional snorts and heaving breaths clotting the air , while faintly in the distance at the bottom of the great decline , the tiniest whines of sirens and rumbling of the freeway drifted up to us . <p> " Bunny , " Roger said , " would you ride up ahead and see how they 're doing ? " <p> " Sure , pardner , " Bunny said , throwing me a strange look-the moonlight , however faint , clearly showed her arched eyebrows and puckered mouth-and then peeling away up the trail . <p> " Bee ? " Roger urged his horse closer to mine so that he could reach over and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . <p> " Did I do something wrong ? " <p> " You 're so cool , Bee , " he said . " Loosen up a little . <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> He got-somehow-his horse to edge even closer , so that when he leaned across his neck , it was almost as though we were sitting together on some stiff , old-fashioned upright divan and his head was nearly resting on my shoulder . <p> " Do n't misunderstand me , " he said . <p> " What ? " <p> " In my position , I could get misunderstood . There 's always girls , you know . " He nodded toward the dark , and I thought that he might have meant something about Bunny . " That 's not what this is about . " <p> " What is it about , Roger ? " <p> Madonna jittered in place , nervous to walk , I figured . Uncomfortable would n't describe what I was feeling then . <p> " Troop 's got to get moving " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So ? " <p> He tried to reach for me , but my horse backed away , spooked a little by his sudden move . <p> " Easy , girl , " he said . <p> " Who are you talking to , Roger ? " I said . <p> " Very funny , " he said , turning in his saddle and looking up the trail into the darkness where all the other riders had long disappeared . " But we should talk . " <p> " I think we should . " <p> Madonna calmed down again , and I felt so good sitting so high up on her , as still as the stillest part of the big mass of her body . <p> " I think we could talk " Roger said . " Bunny tells me that you have a treatment . " <p> " That 's right , pardner , " I said . <p> " Then we can talk . " Roger 's gelding shied just then at some invisible menace in the dark , stamping back a few paces and then letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in that moment Madonna took it upon herself to gush out a long hot stream of particularly pungent flow , the sound of which rushed through the space between Roger and me . <p> " We 'll talk , " he said , and gave his horse a kick that sent them moving up the trail at a rapid rate of speed . <p> " Wait for me , " I called after him , digging my heels into Madonna . I might as well have been urging a statue to move . " Come on , girl ! " I shouted , kicking harder as Roger dissolved into the blackness ahead . <p> And then the dark kicked back , because at that instant these terrible cramps nearly folded me over double in the saddle , and I sat there in agony , unable to get the horse to budge . Tears rolled down my cheeks , the stink of the animal jammed all the way up my nose like slivers of bamboo under the fingernails of some victim in a thirties movie about the Orient . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone up here , and hurting . For a moment the only sound after my voice faded away was the gentle hissing of the methane tubes and the faint tumult of the city below , a whirring , shushing sound that branches make when stirred by a forceful wind . My insides twisted around knotted up . Oh , Mama ! I started to cry . Somebody please come and help me ! <p> I looked up to see mist passing before the moon and the chill of it all settling over me like the gauzy curtain before a big empty screen . <p> And then it came to me , right then and there , just what a scene it would make ! The girl , stranded out here on horseback , her guts churning-but why ? not just like me because she had cramps , though I was thankful that they arrived at last , but something else , what ? like maybe she was pregnant and going into premature labor ? but then why would she even think about going for a ride like this ? wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . she was carrying one man 's child-say , someone like Roger ? and wanted to marry the other , say , Gary ? but how would it go ? how would it go ? and who is she , anyway ? rich girl on her own horse ? or working girl on a rented mount ? a career girl from the Midwest , say ? who came out to work in . . . what ? not the movies , not that , but then what ? a girl my age , pretty , but not sure of herself , attractive to men but not really liking herself all that much , and she drifts into one hurtful affair after another , and she 's got some talent , sure , but there 's something inside of her , some need she has that she does n't want to admit to herself , the opposite of the wild side , of the desperate hope and chance that brought her out here , because . . . because even though it 's a cliche , she 's had to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and she 's not sure of either man , maybe , but she goes along with it , because it 's the business , she gives her whole life to the business , and even though things are going well , say , her mother calls and it all comes to her in the middle of the conversation just how sad she feels , you can see it on her face as she talks on the telephone , she tells herself it 's okay , it 's going to be all . right , and maybe she can have both things , the work and a family when the right guy comes along , and she thought she had found him in this young-what ? - screenwriter ? okay , okay , but I thought she was n't going to be involved in the movies ? - but say that he is a screenwriter , or a lawyer ? or what ? say he runs a restaurant ? no ! or maybe a stable , yes , a riding stable just at the foot of the Santa Monicas , a surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here would ever imagine , a stable in the middle of this huge city , and horses that travel in tunnels under the freeways , kicking up clouds of dust that rise into the air and fade into the smog , and say that they go out for a midnight ride , this woman and her friend , the man she loves , the man she adores , and it turns out that she 's pregnant and does n't even know it , maybe she 's just missed a period and she 's had some irregular periods in the past when she was under a lot of stress , and he tells her-what ? that he 's met someone else ? or that he 's gay ? maybe that ? which leads to the problem of the child and whether or not the man is infected , and say that the baby 's going to be HIV ? and they 're going through hell because of it ? and he decides to say the hell with it all ? and takes off on his mount ? his mount ! and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills of garbage , calling out to him that she does n't care , that she loves him no matter what ? and in the dark she 's galloping alongthink of the scene , this scene , the dark trail , the city like an ocean all around this island made of trash-and the horse stumbles and throws her and the baby dies ? <p> " Bee ? " <p> A woman on horseback came trotting back up the trail , calling my name as she rode . <p> " Hi , " I said , giving the uncooperative Madonna another kick . But I still had trouble . <p> " You all right ? " It was Balu Maginnes . " We thought you might have fallen . " <p> " Where is everybody ? " I said . <p> " Almost back at the stable by now , I 'm sure , " she said . " Roger sent me after you . I 'm a better rider . " She reached for my reins , but I pushed her hand aside . <p> " I 'm okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " So what were you doing up here ? " <p> " Admiring the view , " I said . <p> And then suddenly she turned her horse , and Madonna began to move and followed her mount along the trail past the rest of the methane pumps and then down along the sloping ridge and into the utter darkness of the steeply descending path . My cramps returned ten times worse than before . The trail went down and down , and I dared to turn in the saddle to try and ease my pain , and looked back up to where I had been lingering , dreaming all that time . <p> I could hardly breathe by the time we reached the stables . My nose and mouth and throat were so filled with dust , and my cramps had gotten even worse . Gary was standing there , his small hands planted on his slender hips , looking more miffed than worried . Bunny was waiting with him . So was Roger Maginnes . By the time I turned my horse over to the groom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , Roger and Balu had already gone . <p> " They said they had an early call , " Gary said . " But I could n't abandon you . " <p> " Your legs are really going to hurt in the morning , " Bunny said as she walked with us to the parking lot . <p> " And yours wo n't ? " I said . <p> " It 's just like fucking , " she said . " You have to keep in shape . " <p> Gary was staring at me . " Are you all right ? " he said once we were inside the car . <p> " Yes , I 'm fine . " <p> I tried to sleep on the drive home , but the horse smell lay too thick on me , and I sat there , eyes closed , going over and over the treatment I had imagined in the dark . Once we got to the house , I asked Gary to feed the cat while I stripped off my clothes , tossed them into the washer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thighs resonated in the stinging water . <p> After that , I lay in bed with Meow curled up into a purring ball near my head and the stuffed lamb I had bought at the mall tucked against my rumbling stomach . Next thing I knew , Gary was in the room , saying , " Telephone . " <p> " Oh , " I said , picking up the receiver . <p> " I woke you , did n't I ? " Milt said in his nasal way . <p> " That 's all right . " <p> " I would have left a message on your machine , but I hate those things . I just wanted to say thanks in person . So , thanks . " <p> " You 're welcome ; ' I said . <p> " I 'm vell-come , " he said . " You are , " I said . I looked up at Gary , who shrugged and left the room . <p> " Am I vell-come enough to maybe take you to dinner tomorrow night ? " Milt said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , " I said . <p> " I was n't thinking about it like that , " he said . " Nobody owes anybody anything . This would just be a dinner-dinner . So ? " <p> " Milt , can I think about it ? " <p> " Okay , " he said , and I was sorry to hurt his feelings . But I was too tired to explain anything anymore that night . Though after I hung up , I lay there a while listening to Meow 's insistent breathing and the distant hum of the spin cycle on the washer . I was still awake when the next call came . <p> " Hello ? " <p> " I told you we could talk . " <p> " Roger , " I said , " it 's so late . " <p> " I do some of my best business this time of night , " he said . <p>
