SAFE PLAY Every spring , inspect swing sets or jungle gyms and fix rusty or loose nuts and bolts , weakened supports , or splintered wood . If buying equipment for a child age 2 to 5 , check that he could n't fall more than 5 feet from the highest level ( 6 feet for an older child ) . Look for lightweight plastic or canvas swings ( since metal ones can strike a dangerous blow ) and gliders with plastic bracket covers so that fingers ca n't get caught . Follow the manufacturer 's instructions on anchoring equipment . Grass is n't soft enough for hard landings , so arrange a jungle gym on an 8-to-10-inch-deep layer of wood chips or mulch , extending it out by 6 feet on all sides . If there are swings , extend the soft surface a few more feet . POOL SMARTS Since children can drown in just a few inches of water , empty wading pools and buckets after using and store them upside down . A fence around an in- or aboveground pool should be at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches apart or chain links no larger than 1 3/4 inches so a child ca n't climb them . Be sure the fence has a self-closing and self-latching gate that opens outward , with a lock that 's out of reach . Move any nearby furniture that could be used to climb over the fence . Even if your child has taken swimming lessons , she must still be supervised at all times while in the pool . Store a life preserver and a shepherd 's hook ( long enough to reach the middle of the pool ) nearby . GROUND COVER Protect kids from falls by filling in holes in the ground and covering protruding tree roots with dirt . Do n't use metal lawn or garden edging ; rubber is safer . Fence off a play area to keep kids off the driveway and street . POWER-TOOL POINTERS The best place for children under 12 when you 're using a lawn mower or other motorized equipment is indoors . Some tools are so noisy you ca n't tell if a child is nearby ; others , like the moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rocks , and other debris . Nonpowered garden tools , such as a spade or shovel , pose a danger if they 're sharp . Play it safe : When not in use , all gardening equipment should be locked away . ON DECK When you 're on a deck or porch with a toddler , block off steps with a safety gate and pad sharp furniture . If railings are horizontal or spaced more than 4 inches apart , attach plastic-mesh netting so kids ca n't fall through or get caught . POISON PROTECTION Teach your child not to put any mushrooms , berries , leaves , or flowers into his mouth . Many cause mouth irritation , a stomachache , or nausea when eaten ; and some , including daffodils , azaleas , foxglove , and lots of wild mushrooms , may bring on nearfatal symptoms , such as severe vomiting or a slowed heart rate . TOXIN ALERT A toxic chemical does n't have to be ingested to cause damage . Some bug killers when inhaled can be poisonous . And if chlorine is inhaled or comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or skin , it can cause irritation and burning . Never use pool chemicals or pesticides when your child is around . Always check labels when using either of these items to see how long to wait before your child can safely return to the yard or pool . Store any hazardous material in its original container in a cabinet that locks or on a high shelf . BBQ BASICS You do n't want kids near a hot grill ; ideally one adult should do the cooking while the other watches the children . ( Be careful when serving an outdoor favorite : Hot dogs should be cut in small pieces for young kids . ) If you 're alone , encourage children to play elsewhere in the yard while you cook ; keep them away from the grill after you 're done . Teach kids age 3 and up to avoid the grill as they would a stove . Author Affiliation KAREN BAAR is based in Woodbridge , CT // <p>                    @
