IN THE SUMMER OF THAT <p> year , on my eighteenth birthday , I drove into Alma , Idaho , to register for the draft for the Indonesia War . I filled in all the blanks on the form , printed my name , John Arthur Pembroke , once , signed the form and handed it to the clerk . He looked at me as if he thought I had potential as a soldier . As soon as he okayed the form , I walked out of the office . I shoved my hands in my pockets and stood on the sidewalk in the morning summer sun for a while , thinking . <p> The war had dragged on and on-while I got older and older and was now draft age . If I stayed here , I would be drafted . I believed that . What the clerk inside did n't know was that I did n't have to stay in America . My mother was a citizen of Europe , with a United Kingdom passport . I was half Euro-British . At eighteen I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I chose to be European I would n't be drafted . Most of my friends thought I should take my chance and go to Europe and forget this place . I was the one who was not sure . I thought I wanted to be an American , though I did not want to have to fight to keep Indonesia together . No one had lifted a finger when Indonesia had forced the Mindanao Partition , then took over New Guinea , Palau , the Solomons , Sabah . Indonesia threatened Singapore , Brunei , and the rest of Malaysia in the short term . The corporations running America had argued that " unification " made the East Indies more stable . They offered increased trade as proof . A country like Indonesia could quiet down the region and organize its advance into sweatshops and ecological devastation . But the independence movements - in the conquered territories and on other islands : Borneo , Bali , the Moluccas , Timor- kept growing stronger , with covert Chinese , Japanese , and probably Thai help , and now America was once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in Asia . <p> I walked down the sidewalk thinking that , were it not for my mother 's nationality , the course of my life would have been out of my control . For three years in a row I 'd watched pudgy military officers on TV spin a Vietnam-era basket with three hundred sixty-six little plastic capsules that held slips of paper with dates printed on them , one for every day of the year and February 29 . The officer would pull out the capsules one at a time , open them , and read off the dates . The guys born on the first two hundred twenty-five were drafted . Not all of them came home . For three years my birthday was one of the first two hundred twenty-five , and I had to sit there , with my high school math or geography homework unattended in my lap , watching a fat officer represent chance determining my fate . But thanks to my mother , chance would not determine my fate where this war was concerned . I would . <p> I drove our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked slowly to the house . I needed to change back into work clothes and start hauling hay . Mother was stirring a cake in the kitchen , the birthday cake we 'd have with dinner that night , and she looked up at me with worried eyes . She wiped her hands on her apron and hugged me and would n't let me go change for a while , she just held onto me . <p> That night , for my birthday present , she and Father gave me a ticket to England to visit my Aunt Alice , Mother 's sister ; Aunt Alice 's two children , my cousins Emily and Clayton ; and Uncle Harold , Mother 's brother who had never married but who had " tramped all over the world , " as she would put it ; " explored the dark corners , " he would say . Mother was so happy that I would finally get to see the places she loved , the house she had grown up in , the England of the Arthurian legends she 'd told me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that , of course . I lay in bed that night and realized my parents ' present to me was more than a ticket . It was a chance to look around England and make my choice . My parents had said nothing about this over dinner . We 'd talked about it plenty of times before . But my choice had been with us through the meal . I knew Mother considered herself blessed to be able to give her son what all mothers would have given if they could : a sure way out of war , to life . <p> IF YOU HAD LOOKED at Emily and Clayton and me that summer , you could not have known what all of us would go on to do with our lives . I look at the old photographs Aunt Alice took of us together and see young people with nothing to set them apart . Clayton and I were barely shaving , maybe every other day , and I still had half an inch to grow , Clayton maybe an inch and a half . But one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the pictures of the woman I now see in the netzines , her long , black hair is wild , windblown , as if she spends the better part of each day walking along the Somerset coast with the wind off the sea blowing her hair . <p> At the time , Aunt Alice was a newly elected Member of Parliament , but Parliament was in recess , and Emily was on holiday from her boarding school . They picked me up at Heathrow , and we drove across the moors to Somerset and the family ancestral home on the west bank of the Parrett River , near where it empties into the sea . I could smell the sea when I got out of the car . <p> And apples . The house was surrounded by apple orchards , and the apples were ripe and falling . The ground was littered with golden and red apples . A handful of workers holding remotes walked around under the trees . I did not understand what they were doing till I saw a flash of silver metal moving high up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . The workers were guiding robots picking the apples . No one I knew in Idaho had robotic help in the fields . Central American human labor was still cheaper for us . <p> " Those are rare apples , " Aunt Alice said . She came to stand by me . " Some of the varieties are , perhaps , found nowhere else - and it 's a good thing someone has them . Apples are in a precarious way worldwide . People grow ten percent of the varieties our ancestors grew just one hundred years ago . A disease could destroy any species that reduced . I feel our rarities might someday be important for grafting strength back into the main stocks . " <p> She talked with me easily about her orchards . She had always talked to me , even when I was a boy during her visits : even then she would take the time , and I loved her for it . Now , as then , I found myself interested in whatever she wanted to talk about  --  Central Asian politics , Uzbeki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerity , always clear to me , were what eventually made her foreign secretary to two prime ministers in Brussels . But I always remembered her worry about the apples and was not surprised years later at her treaties with Kazakstan , and her work to preserve the ancient apple forests there where apples had first evolved . <p> " Emily will show you the orchards after you unpack , " Aunt Alice said . Servants came to help carry in our bags . Aunt Alice gave me a room on the third floor , with windows looking out toward the sea , which I could see beyond the trees . I 'd seen the sea only twice before , in California , at Malibu and Laguna Beach , and I suddenly wanted to get down to this sea and walk along this beach . I unpacked quickly and thought I should tell Aunt Alice where I was going . I hurried down to the main floor , looking for her . <p> The house was quiet and cool in the afternoon heat . I kept thinking of my mother growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl and later a young woman on these stairs ; walking these hallways , opening doors into all these rooms . I walked through an open door into a great room paneled in dark wood . An enormous stone fireplace stood in the far wall , and over the mantle hung a sword . I walked to the sword . It looked heavy and old . The hilt was worn , but the blade had been kept polished and it shone even in the dim light . Latin words were inscribed on it near the hilt . " Do you read Latin ? " <p> It was Emily , standing in the doorway . <p> " A little , " I said . I 'd taken a Latin class in high school , the standard beginners ' course . <p> Emily crossed to the windows and pulled back the drapes . In the sudden light , I could read this Latin : Ex Calibur . <p> " You men are so predictable , " Emily said . " I asked Mother whether I would find you in this room looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the library looking at the books . We both decided on the sword . " <p> " I never saw the library , " I said , a little annoyed . <p> " Let me show you where it is . " <p> I followed her and never asked , then , about the sword and its fanciful inscription . The library was down the hall , and it was enormous , paneled in the same dark wood as the room with the sword . All the bookshelves were made out of that wood . I felt the rough finish on the shelves while Emily again crossed to the windows to open the drapes . <p> " Lyonnesse wood , " Emily said , watching me . <p> " I 've never heard of it . " <p> " Here . " She carefully took a book down from its shelf : Richard Carew 's The Survey of Cornwall , published in 1602 . She set it on the table . The book crackled when she opened it , but it was not dusty . She turned the pages to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scilly Isles . <p> " The wood from this forest used to wash up on the beaches , even as far north as here in Somerset , " she said . " People gathered it and made things out of it , like this house . " <p> " This house is built out of driftwood ? " I asked , incredulous . I did n't know what to make of Emily then . could n't decide whether she was teasing me - telling me fables to see whether I was simple enough to believe them - or whether she was telling the truth . <p> " Oh , not just the house , " she said . " Some of the furniture , too . We have a table made out of it . You 'll see . Tristan came from the land where these forests grew . " <p> I decided not to ask if she meant the literary Tristan , but lf had an idea that she did . All of this was starting to come together in my mind to make me see the great joke I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calibur , wood from a sunken land , mention of a knight of the round table . " I 'd like to walk down to the sea to look for some of your driftwood , " I told her . <p> Emily reshelved the book and while she did she quoted part of a poem to me : <p> Say if we three <p> Will go to the sea <p> To gather dark wood on the beach . <p> " What is that from ? " I asked . <p> " A poem I 'm writing , " she said . " Let 's do walk to the beach . It will inspire me . I 'll tell Mother where we 're going . " <p> She left , and I walked over to look at the books shelved near the Carew , all of them in sunlight near the window . The first were medieval books written in Hebrew . Some had apparently been translated into Latin , a few into English : Legends of the Jews , The Book of the Jests of Alexander of Macedon , King Anus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert de Boron 's Joseph d'Arimathie , subtitled Roman de l'estoire dou Graal , Eschenbach 's Parzival , a book titled Queste del Saint Graal . Of course I found Mallory 's Le Morte d'Arthur . Tennyson 's Idylls of the King lay open on the table . <p> All this began to explain my mother 's fascination with Arthurian legend . She had grown up surrounded by all these " artifacts . " Someone in the past had loved the legends of Arthur and had collected these books and the sword . My mother had loved them in her turn , and she 'd made me interested . <p> Emily came back for me , and we walked through the orchards and picked apples and carried them to a rocky beach strewn with driftwood , though none of it dark like the wood in the house . We spent the afternoon gathering driftwood into a pile taller than our heads for a bonfire we 'd burn one night after Clayton and Uncle Harold came down from Oxford . The waves crashed on the shore and sprayed us with water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We let the wind blow our hair . <p> Clayton and Uncle Harold drove down from Oxford that evening . Clayton was in his first year reading mathematics at Oxford , and Uncle Harold lectured there on history . They arrived just before dinner . Clayton and I looked a little alike - you could tell we were first cousins . Uncle Harold was as tall and thin as I remembered , with white hair , a white mustache and trimmed beard , and bright , happy eyes . <p> " Tell me about Mary , " he said , and I told him about my mother and gave him a letter she 'd sent with me for him . He had me describe our farm : how many thousand acres it had now , how many head of cattle , the value of the land per acre . It was more than just polite interest , I knew . He and Aunt Alice had invested a small fortune in the farm when Mother married , took her inheritance , and went to live in America . <p> After we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and rushed around the house : he ran up the stairs to unpack ; he ran back down to the library to quickly read my Mother 's letter , stuff it in a pocket , then pull books from the shelves and sit at the table , reading , following his fingers hurriedly along the lines ; he hurried to supper when Aunt Alice called us . <p> And , of course , the dining-room table was round . It was made out of the same dark wood as the paneling and shelves . I stood there smiling at the table until Aunt Alice asked me to sit between Emily and Uncle Harold . <p> " This is the table I was telling you about , " Emily said . <p> " Made out of wood from a sunken forest , " I said , touching its ebony , polished surface . I expected someone to laugh , but no one did . <p> " It could be that old , " Aunt Alice said . " At least it 's old enough to be wobbly . The wood certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark grow in England . " <p> " There 's a darker wood in the Celebes , " Uncle Harold said . " Rare now . " And he began a story about how he had once worked his way through the interior of Sulawesi , looking for a rumored Malay city in the highlands that had never submitted to the Dutch or to the independent Indonesia , and which had already been Christian before the Dutch or even the Portuguese had sailed to the East . On his way there , Uncle Harold and his porters had come across a small , black tree growing alone on a barren hillside . The porters had cut it down , carried it with them , and sold it for a fortune in Ujung Pandang when they 'd returned to the coast . <p> " But what about the Christians ? " Aunt Alice asked . <p> The conversation went on like that through dinner . Uncle Harold had lived a remarkable life , some of which I had followed in his letters to Mother and much of which Mother had told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa when Europe had been forced to secure its southern border and liberate the peoples of North Africa from the thugs who 'd ruled them . He 'd crossed the Sahara three times , become lifelong friends with Coptic monks , and wrote a history of their order ; later , he 'd spent years exploring the Himalayan foothills in India and Nepal , looking for signs of the Nestorians - " Or the Yeti , " he said , with a smile - and poking into Bhutan and Mustang , Sikkim and Tibet , and finally the outer islands of Indonesia , writing the histories of little-known places and forgotten peoples . But I kept thinking about war . He had fought in a war . Eventually I asked him about it . <p> Everyone looked at me . " Those were glorious years , " Uncle Harold said , after a pause . " Never has good and evil been so clearly allied with opposite sides in a modern conflict . Those lunatics with nuclear bombs had meant to take over Europe , loot it , convert any survivors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you imagine it ? In this age ? " <p> Two women came in and took away the dinner plates , then served dessert . <p> " Have you considered studying at Oxford " Clayton asked me , and I realized they were all wondering whether I had come just to visit or whether I had come to stay . I looked at the dark paneling and the dark furniture and the bright , kind , intelligent faces around the table , and felt I would be welcome here . <p> " I 've considered Oxford , " I said . " My father and mother recommend applying . " <p> We talked , then , about the war in Indonesia and , typically European , they were all against it . <p> Aunt Alice and Emily went up to bed soon after dessert . Uncle Harold went back to his books , and Clayton and I played chess in the room with the fireplace and the sword till he could n't stay awake any longer and went to bed . I could n't sleep . It was morning in Idaho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I sat at the chess table and looked at the sword above the mantle . On an impulse , I got up and took it down and tried to hold it . <p> It was heavy . With both hands on the hilt , I could lift the sword above my head and even swing it , but I tried to imagine fighting with it - the weight would have made it unwieldy in my hands . The men who had fought with swords centuries before had held them in only one hand and a shield or battle ax in the other . If I had had to fight on a medieval battlefield , with weapons this heavy , I would have been killed in short order : I could not have handled my weapons . <p> I put back the sword and decided I should go to bed to try to sleep and get accustomed to the new schedule . On the way to the stairs , I passed the library . No one was in it . Uncle Harold had gone . <p> But the room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of those books in their shadowy shelves and the pool of candlelight on the dark table strewn with papers and books has remained etched in my memory . I walked to the table and saw that someone had turned Idylls of the King to a new page . Uncle Harold had pulled down old Dutch books on the East Indies , and one of his own , his History of the Celebes and the Outer Moluccas . His book was left open on the table , and he had taken a pen and crossed out three paragraphs in chapter nine about the early Christian missionaries and penciled notes in the margin . He must have been preparing the book for a reprinting . The papers at the far end of the table were poems of Emily 's , in progress . The top paper read : <p> Say if we three <p> Will go to the sea , <p> To gather dark wood on the beach . <p> We 'd bum it at night , <p> To tame with the light <p> The creatures that haunt us in dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look at Emily 's papers like this . I walked up to my room and went to bed . When I finally slept , I dreamed I was with armies of men fighting with swords and battle axes on a Somerset beach where great bonfires burned . My opponent was potbellied , but strong . I could barely lift my sword and shield , they were so heavy , but he could handle his quite well . All I could manage to do was parry away his thrusts and stabs and keep backing up toward the sea . <p> He was going to kill me . <p> " Who are you ? " I asked him , breathless . <p> " Robert de Boron , " he grunted , and I thought , good , if he 's Robert de Boron , the writer , maybe I can reason with him , so I tried to keep him talking . " Why do we have to fight like this ? " I asked . " We should n't be here . What kind of work did you do before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baker , " he shouted at me , and my heart sank to think that a man who had baked pastries and bread would kill me . He was n't a writer at all , he just had a writer 's name . I kept talking to him anyway , telling him I had been a farmer and that my family had crops in the field that needed to be harvested , and eventually I asked him not to kill me . He looked at me oddly , but stepped back , and we stopped fighting . I shouted at my friends to stop , and the baker shouted at his , and eventually everyone did stop fighting and our two sides separated and went to the bonfires to cook supper . I would not sit by a fire to eat , because I did not trust the peace to hold , and I hurried through the crowds looking for a blacksmith . I wanted to ask him to draw off some of the metal from my weapons to make them lighter so I could handle them <p> And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four in the morning . The moon shone softly through the window . I lay there remembering my dream . The guns I 'd carry in Indonesia would be as heavy as the old sword downstairs , and many times more deadly . It would n't be like in my dream . If I went to war I 'd first be taught how to handle my weapons . <p> And I would have to learn that , I realized . I would have to learn how to use deadly weapons . I decided that , lying there in the dark . America had been my country all my life : it would be my country for the rest of it . It needed people who would do what I was going to do . I did not support the war . If America were fighting to protect an ally from tyranny I would join the army , but that was not what this war was about . So the army of my country would have to draft me to get me to fight its current battles . What mattered was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself darkly in the dresser mirror . I would have to live with this decision and remember it every time I looked in a mirror the rest of my life . People back home would support me at first , before they knew what I was going to do . The peace movement was not loved , yet . It did n't matter . I would go to war , then come home to work for the peace movement . I 'd have more credibility if I had seen war and afterward worked for peace . It was the only way I could think to make it work . Insisting that one 's country live up to its highest ideals was not unpatriotic . <p> I resented being eighteen and forced to make decisions like this . But when , I wondered , in the history of humankind had n't eighteen-year-olds been forced to make decisions about killing and being killed ? <p> A wind was blowing , and I could hear the sea crashing on the beach . I got up to look out the windows and saw Uncle Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orchards . His hair and beard were white in the moonlight . He would pull on his beard , then gesticulate with his hands as if he were carrying on some argument in his mind or attempting to convince someone of a course of action he feared or found preposterous . I thought he looked like Don Quixote , parted , somehow , from Sancho and Rocinante . Or maybe Sancho was sleeping in the orchard and this pacing of my uncle 's was some knightly vigil he had to keep to honor a vow . <p> I watched him and thought how he had fought in a brutal war for ideals he believed in , and he 'd seen his side triumph . The North African War had been a grand effort , so different from what I would be called to take part in . <p> I watched Uncle Harold and thought of his interest in Arthurian legend - of the interest of all my British family in those legends - and how it was not the Arthurian wars they cared about , despite the sword 's place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Tennyson poem ; the magic , in Emily 's poem . I began to wonder , given Uncle Harold 's delving into the histories of Nestorian and Celebes Christians , whether his explorations and studies were a continuing quest for the Holy Grail . <p> I DECIDED NOT to say anything about my decision for a few days . I wanted to enjoy a little more time in England before facing my relatives ' questions . Uncle Harold was not at breakfast . Aunt Alice was in a hurry to get back to Brussels and Parliament , which had been called into session to debate an American request for logistical support in an ongoing offensive . Emily and Clayton and I tried to stay out of her whirl of activity and waved good-bye to her from the steps . When she was gone , Emily and Clayton looked at me , and we all went inside and met Uncle Harold in the hallway . <p> " You have just enough time to make your banners before we set off , " he said . <p> " To where ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonfire , and your fates ! " he answered . <p> I laughed , but servants came in with poles for each of us to fly banners from , and Emily took Clayton and me upstairs to the second-floor sewing room where she pulled out boxes of scraps of material of all kinds and colors , and we actually started making banners to carry before us on a walk to the beach . <p> It was slow going for Clayton and me , since the sewing we had done up to that point amounted to sewing buttons back on shirts . Emily found three long strips of white cloth , sewed them around the end of her pole , and left to pack a picnic lunch . Clayton wanted a red banner because he 'd become a Marxist , as he called it , at Oxford , but we could n't find any red scraps , so he had to settle for burgundy . I cut equal lengths of blue , orange , green , and purple cloth and made a banner that would fly like a rainbow . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Harold taking the sword down from above the mantle . Clayton had found towels and swimsuits for the men and a tall umbrella . Emily came from the kitchen with a picnic basket , sunscreen , and her towel and swimsuit under her arm , and Uncle Harold led us out , sword held before him , the three of us following along behind with our banners blowing in the wind . <p> We picked apples off the ground in the orchard to take with us . I carried the picnic basket . When we came to the beach , Uncle Harold had us post our banners on three different peaks of rock around the driftwood Emily and I had gathered . We spent the day swimming , laughing , lying in the sun . We ate the picnic lunch late in the afternoon . <p> At dusk we lit the bonfire , and it roared above us . We had to stand back quite far until it burned down and we could sit on rocks close to it . Uncle Harold suddenly stood and thrust the sword into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stood there with his hands on the hilt , looking at us , knightly , somehow , the way Don Quixote must have looked even as an old man . I did n't know what to expect . Emily and Clayton looked a little bewildered , too . <p> " I am the oldest in our family , " Uncle Harold said , finally , " and as such I have brought you here to perform a sacred duty . This night I will knight you into the order of your family . " <p> This was unexpected , but theatrical , and I found myself wanting to go along with my uncle 's fun . So I did n't laugh . Our banners snapped in the wind in the rocks above us . <p> " First hear the history of your family , " he said . " And believe it . You are descended from Arthur , King at Camelot , he of legend . " <p> " And Guinevere ? " Emily asked . She looked startled , as if this talk of Uncle Harold 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yes , " Uncle Harold said . Emily brushed back her hair and looked at the fire . Her reaction surprised me . It was hard for me to take this seriously . Clayton was watching Uncle Harold intently but said nothing . <p> Uncle Harold looked at me till I 'd stopped smiling . None of us spoke . I could hear only waves crashing on the rocks and the bonfire burning till Uncle Harold spoke again . <p> " Your Great-Uncle George brought your mothers and me to this beach thirty years ago and knighted us : Alice to the work of state , that she might preserve the political integrity of this land ; Mary to the nurturing of farmland , which would blossom for her and increase the fortune of the family ; me to the pursuit of knowledge forgotten in the West , but kept alive in hidden places of the world .

" <p> She did so , and her white blouse and black hair blew back in the wind . " I knight you , Emily , to the work of poetry , " Uncle Harold said . " I give you the power to slay all dragons of despair , sloth , or rejection standing in the way of your insights and success . I bless you with the ability to bring written beauty to the lives of people who need beauty .

She folded her arms and watched the rest of us , her hair blowing wildly . <p> Uncle Harold called Clayton to kneel in front of the sword . " I knight you , Clayton , to the theories of physics , " Uncle Harold said , " that you might lead humankind to the stars . " He drew the sword out of the sand , touched Clayton 's shoulders , and had him stand back by the fire . <p> I was next . I wondered what Uncle Harold would knight me to . He did not know me like he knew Emily and Clayton . I knelt before the sword .

Suddenly it was as if I saw myself marching with thousands of others and speaking to crowds and writing works that transformed nations and sent all bakers home from the battlefields . <p> " I charge you , " Uncle Harold said , " to call together the young of the family when they are of age to knight them in their turn . " <p> They 'd planned this , I suddenly knew - my mother and my aunt and uncle . This was why I had had to come to England .

I could sense the beauty and adventure and hope we would each bring into the world before we had done it . <p> Uncle Harold led us back through the darkness , guided only by moonlight , through the orchards of apples so fragrant in the night .
