<p> Colorado 's most controversial law is about to get another day in court . <p> And this time , the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court will decide the issue . <p> The court will hear arguments Oct. 10 on whether Colorado voters were within their rights when they decided homosexuals can not be protected from discrimination in housing , employment and matters of public accommodations . <p> Known as Amendment 2 to the Colorado Constitution , the measure 's premise is both straightforward and explosive : Amendment 2 says no town , county , school board or branch of state government can have a law or policy that singles out gays for protection against discrimination . <p> In practical terms , it 's a mandate that state universities and cities such as Aspen and Boulder erase their gay-rights policies . <p> Amendment 2 went to state voters in 1992 . Fifty-three percent of them approved it , but the measure was never implemented . Colorado judges decided Amendment 2 was fundamentally unfair , and they blocked it . <p> Despite their courtroom victories in Colorado , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court will rule in their favor when the justices announce their decision next May or June . <p> " I think we are in a climate now where there is a lot of anti-affirmative action sentiment - there is a lot of ' anti , anti , anti , " ' said Beatrice Dohrn , legal director of the Lambda Education &; Legal Fund , a gay rights organization . " There is a lot of sentiment that people should n't be protected by the law from these forms of discrimination . " <p> The Colorado Supreme Court 's 6-1 decision striking down the amendment was written by one of its most conservative members , Chief Justice Luis Rovira . Rovira and most of his colleagues said Amendment 2 violated the U.S. Constitution by " fencing out " gays from the political process . <p> Now , the U.S. Supreme Court will decide if that October 1994 ruling will stand . <p> In its last session , the high court showed itself to be conservative in matters dealing with federal affirmative action programs , school segregation and election district boundaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole this is looking less like a court that is willing to move into new areas of protecting civil liberties , " said Gene Nichol , dean of the University of Colorado Law School . <p> " I think in each of those cases , the Supreme Court refused to recognize civil liberty interests that they might have recognized sometime in the past . ... The court seems to be moving away from traditional liberal positions . " <p> Most observers on both sides of the Amendment 2 issue say the highest court in America has no liberals and , at most , seats four " moderates . " A bloc of five conservative justices can dominate . <p> This gives proponents of Amendment 2 hope that they may win in the court of last resort . Such a ruling , they say , would be justice at long last . <p> Tony Marco , founder of Colorado for Family Values , believes the state needed Amendment 2 to scuttle people intent on abusing the system . <p> Back in 1991 , he says , he saw a cohesive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themselves . That 's when Marco went to work . <p> Convinced that Colorado officials were going to support a statewide gay-rights bill and that its passage was " imminent and almost certain , " Marco hurriedly did some research . He also got a lawyer . <p> Together , they wrote Amendment 2 , a 96-word amendment that banned the passage or enforcement of gay-rights laws in Colorado . <p> Duke University law expert Jerome Culp testified in 1993 that those 96 words amount to one of the most repressive laws in U.S. history . The only thing worse , he said , was an 1837 measure prohibiting blacks from petitioning the Ohio Legislature . <p> Marco , a 52-year-old who writes poetry and is the author of seven books , said the amendment would be written differently if he could do things over again . <p> " You know , we put this together so quickly , " he said . " I take responsibility for the way the amendment was framed because there was no other way to do it at the time , or so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by writing fund-raising material for profit and nonprofit organizations , said he is no longer associated with CFV . He says he has an open dialogue with gay leaders and believes he has their respect . <p> But , Marco said , he did what he did in 1991 because he wanted to stop homosexuals from getting something they do n't deserve . <p> What they do n't deserve , he contends , are " special " protections accorded to other people because of their race , gender or ethnic origin . <p> He was upset that three Colorado communities , Aspen , Boulder and Denver , had approved laws giving gays and lesbians protections from discrimination . He wanted those laws repealed . <p> The Aspen law dates back to 1977 . City council members in the ski resort approved a wide-ranging employment , housing and public accommodations law . It prohibited discrimination on the basis of race , color , creed , religion , sex , age and " affectional or sexual orientation . " <p> Boulder and Denver approved their laws later . <p> Marco views gays as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disadvantaged class . " Such a group , he said , " should not be allowed to fraudulently appropriate the status and benefits reserved for the poor and powerless . It is as simple as that . <p> " I do n't for a moment condemn the entire gay community for the actions of the militant few who , frankly , have been trying to perpetrate blatant civil-rights fraud . I do n't think it is necessary to condemn every single gay individual for these kinds of fraudulent actions . " <p> Amendment 2 says gays and lesbians are not to be accorded the same " minority " status as racial or ethnic minorities or given " quota preferences . " <p> But the key to the amendment , and its fatal flaw according to some legal experts , is that it prohibits gays and lesbians from ever bringing claims of discrimination . <p> Eben Moglen , a professor at the Columbia Law School , has filed a brief in the Amendment 2 case on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow gays and lesbians to complain about discrimination . <p> " Everybody in this society has a right to be protected against arbitrary and capricious conduct , " Moglen said in an interview . <p> If a constitutional amendment denies someone the opportunity to be protected from arbitrary conduct and discrimination that everyone else is protected from , the targeted person or group loses basic , equal rights , Moglen said . <p> For example , if the state decided to establish " lesbian only " restrooms or " homosexual only " water fountains in the state Capitol , gays could not appeal , said Moglen . If a lesbian goes to court in hopes of retaining a child in a custody battle with a former husband , she would have no avenue of appeal if the judge declared her an " unfit parent " without hearing any testimony . <p> " In a society which claims to govern by law , everybody 's access to the law has to be equal , " Moglen said . " On top of the marble and bronze doors of the court is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's basic . And we say that Amendment 2 has the effect of denying equal justice under the law - you 've got a different brand of justice in Colorado if you are gay . " <p> Former Colorado Supreme Court Justice Jean Dubofsky will address the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of Amendment 2 opponents . She believes that 10 years ago , opponents of Amendment 2 would have won easily . <p> But now " it is a very , very conservative court , and when you are looking at the middle you are looking at a conservative middle . It 's not a middle that one would say is a moderate middle . " <p> Like Moglen , Dubofsky claims two separate systems of justice will be set up in Colorado if Amendment 2 is upheld . <p> " If you are discriminated ( against ) on the basis of sexual orientation there are two sets of rules - your rule for gay people is that there is nothing you can do about discrimination . Everyone else can seek remedies from discrimination no matter what the discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state government will represent the people who approved Amendment 2 . Attorney General Gale Norton and Solicitor General Tim Tymkovich say sound reasons exist for Amendment 2 . They also argue that the Colorado Supreme Court overstepped itself in striking down the law . <p> Norton and Tymkovich say Amendment 2 is sound because it : <p> Eliminates provisions that force landlords and religious institutions to open their buildings and churches to homosexuals , even if this goes against preferences of the state 's population . <p> Maximizes civil-rights protections for those who the people of Colorado believe are particularly deserving . <p> Results in a single , uniform rule about homosexuals that makes efficient enforcement easier . It eliminates divergent legal standards and city-by-city and county-by-county political battles . <p> The state points to the scathing dissent in the Colorado decision of Supreme Court Justice William Erickson . He said his colleagues played social architects and forgot their roles as judges when they issued the Amendment 2 ruling . <p> " If ever a court was guilty of an unabashedly result-oriented approach , this case is a prime example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " crafted a new fundamental right that has never been recognized by the United States Supreme Court . " <p> In its brief to the U.S. Supreme Court , the state claimed that the Colorado Supreme Court created " out of whole cloth " a new fundamental " group right " never before seen in the United States . <p> " We are going to argue a couple of key points , " Solicitor General Tymkovich said . <p> One is that the Colorado Supreme Court " disregarded previous U.S. Supreme Court precedent ( to not extend constitutional protection to gays ) . And what happened here was that the people of the state made a particular policy choice . After a hard-fought and fair election , that decision was embodied in Amendment 2 . <p> " It was an appropriate decision to make on a statewide basis . " <p> Tymkovich said Amendment 2 takes away no one 's fundamental civil rights , including voting rights . He does n't buy into the " parade of horribles " that Amendment 2 opponents claim may result . <p> He said talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ridiculous . <p> " I think the court ( U.S. Supreme Court ) should disregard all these hypothetical horribles . That 's absurd , " said Tymkovich . <p> " Amendment 2 does n't mandate governmental discrimination . Amendment 2 does n't change the judicial protections combatting those sorts of discriminations . It is completely implausible in the political context of Colorado " that there would be separate facilities for homosexuals if Amendment 2 became law . <p> " Amendment 2 simply repeals a public benefit that gays have sought - special protections . But every other constitutional right they had before they will have after the implementation of Amendment 2 . " <p> Another outspoken critic of the Colorado Supreme Court decision is Washington lawyer Michael Carvin , who earlier this year convinced a federal circuit court of appeals that a Cincinnati measure banning protections for gays was constitutional . <p> In Cincinnati , Carvin worked on behalf of " Equal Rights , Not Special Rights , " an organization similar to Colorado for Family Values . Carvin has filed a brief on behalf of his organization in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , 1993 , Colorado voters passed Amendment 2 by a vote of 53.4 percent to 46.6 percent . The amendment reads : <p> " No Protected Status Based on Homosexual , Lesbian , or Bisexual Orientation . Neither the State of Colorado , through any of its branches or departments , nor any of its agencies , political subdivisions , municipalities or school districts , shall enact , adopt or enforce any statute , regulation , ordinance or policy whereby homosexual , lesbian or bisexual orientation , conduct , practices or relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of or entitle any person or class of persons to have or claim any minority status , quota preference , protected status or claim of discrimination . This section of the Constitution shall be in all respects self-executing. "
