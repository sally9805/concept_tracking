For Christmas , Wendell Spear and his granddaughter , Jennifer Abarbanel , went AWOL . That is , they did n't spend it in St. Louis with her parents-his daughter and son-in-law-but with each other in San Francisco , where Jennifer was an associate of Schmidt , Barczyk and Cole and had her own electronically packed cubical on the twenty-fourth floor of No. 2 Embarcadero Center . " I want to show you what you paid for , Grandpa . " <p> " Helped , Fer . Slightly . But I want to see it . At least you in it . " Which is when he cooked up the Christmas they 'd spend together , her first away from home since her junior year in France . <p> In many ways , Spear felt closer to Fer than to anyone he 'd ever known . The feeling had intensified over the years , but it began the day his daughter told him , twenty-five odd years ago , that she was pregnant . The night his son-in-law phoned with news of the arrival- " Jennifer 's arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " - Spear walked the canyon road outside his Beverly Glen house in a terrific state of exaltation . He 'd been a father twenty-seven years , but-as he thought about it that night-fatherhood had been more sheerly biological and egocentric than thoughtful and sociable . Fatherhood , a sort of chest-pounding semi-aggression , had certified his manliness : " Take that . " Grandfatherhood was more abstract , mental . There was a dignity in it that completed him in a way fatherhood had n't . It meant that , somehow or other , he 'd done his duty , raised or helped raise someone well enough so that she 'd wanted-and had-her own child . Or so he 'd thought , walking among the cypress and palms under the stars , imagining this seven pound six ounce person whom he 'd never seen , heard , or touched , but who was , somehow , his . <p> A few weeks before this Christmas , Spear had read an Updike story that ended with the protagonist holding his just-born granddaughter and thinking , " No one belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful , if chilly , writer . In a way , his protagonist 's conclusion was right as well as chilly : it was only in memory , at least in the mind , that relationships and feelings existed ; language transmitted what the body could n't . Yet , if the grammatical possessives mine and my , were mental , they did stand for something real . Jennifer was n't chattel , but she was his , his grandchild , not Updike 's , not anyone else 's ( except her other living grandpa , Grandpa Abarbanel , and two dead grandmothers ) . It was not owning , so much as belonging . He and Jennifer , for better or for worse , belonged to each other . Belonging , cousin of longing , needing , wanting , enjoying , even-to use the frayed participle that Spear seldom used-loving . <p> " Jennifer 's arrived , Grandpa . All seven pounds , six ounces of her . " <p> Spear opened a bottle of Mumms and toasted Vanessa : " Here 's to you , Grandma . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those terrifying things , were , tonight , clear and benign . Somehow , in some infinitesimal way , he , Wendell Wallace Spear , son of Irene and Malcolm , father of Amelia and now grandfather of Jennifer Abarbanel , belonged with them . This new layer of generation made plane geometry solid , made a cosmos out of almost chaos . Walking up the road , a white ribbon under a white moon , Spear felt a new friendliness in space . Perhaps , one day , Jennifer Spear Abarbanel Something-orOther-if girls would still be taking their husbands ' names , if there were still such things as husbands-would be walking the same road , celebrating the birth of her granddaughter , his great-great one ! ( Of course Jennifer would have the house , have everything he had and was , his files , his records , CDs , videos , his film library , his books ; she already had his genes . ) And maybe her granddaughter would walk here as well-if human beings still walked , if there were still roads to walk on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told Ezra Keneret , " I had no idea it would be so different from paternity . Why has n't it been written about more ? You know that Ghirlandaio painting of an old fellow with a wart looking at his beautiful grandson ? I do n't think there 's a literary equivalent . Maybe the grandmother in Proust , but she 's seen through the boy 's eyes . " <p> " Brando 's death scene in Godfather , scaring his grandson with the orange peel in his mouth . " <p> " Yes , but a Mafia family 's different : it 's against the world . This way , you join the world . You 're an old single-gauge track merging with the main one . " <p> " You are high , Wendell . " <p> " I am , and I have n't even seen the little thing . Yet I love her ; love the idea of her , but also love her . She 's mine . My granddaughter . " <p> " I should envy you , but , for some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Why should it ? It 's unearned , undeserved . Unless you get points for raising a kid who wants a kid of his own . " <p> " I do n't think Grandpa and Grandma Hitler should get points . " <p> 2 . <p> From the beginning , Spear and Jennifer had been friends , allies , partners , plus what they were-grandfather and granddaughter . He could n't remember a word they 'd exchanged that was n't inflected by admiration , joshing , concern , or affection . <p> Perhaps distance had made their relationship easier . She 'd lived two thousand miles away in St. Louis until she went off to school in Northampton , a thousand miles farther away . He usually saw her only twice a year , Christmas and summer . One year , the junior year abroad , he did n't see her at all . Then , four years ago , she 'd come to California for law school , and now she 'd begun her legal career in San Francisco with Schmidt , Barczyk and Cole , sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there since July , had taken and passed the bar exam in September- " the worst three days of my life , I was too nervous to pee " - and he had n't seen her yet . When she agreed that they spend Christmas together , she said she only had three days off and that he 'd be alone the rest of the week . <p> " I 'm good at being alone . You 're more society than I 've had in years . " <p> Still , to fill out his time , and to make the Christmas even more a family affair , Spear called his cousin Hugh Wallace and suggested that they rendezvous in San Francisco . Hugh 's son Timothy lived across the bridge in Marin County . A couple of years ago , when Jennifer was at law school at Davis and Tim was forming his band in Santa Cruz , the old cousins introduced the young ones to each other . They should be friends and perhaps something more . Fer was twentyfive now and Timmy three years older . <p> Twenty-five seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years back , in the French pension when his morning roll and coffee was brought in by sweet , squirrel-mouthed Andree , who , when Spear , rudely , asked her age , said " Moi , je danse la Catrinette , " and , seeing his puzzlement , explained , " I 'm twenty-five and unmarried . " Spear , himself twenty-one , had just met Vanessa De Groat at a film club and eleven months after that , was the father of Jennifer 's mother . <p> For decades , he 'd made a virtue of youthful marriage and paternity : " It stopped my fooling around , made me buckle down to work . " Now , though , it reinforced his apprehension about Fer : he 'd read enough journalistic demography to know her generation 's Malthusian need to diminish the human swarm , but would she end up as forlorn as poor Andree ? <p> Hugh had married and fathered late , so Timmy was Jennifer 's contemporary . They 'd made a grand match , the cousins told each other . However , Timmy did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of U. Cal Santa Cruz in his freshman year and made an unsure living playing guitar in bands . In the past four years , he 'd made enough to live without handouts from Hugh . Spear liked him . He was sensible , curious , amusing , decent , maybe a bit innocent , but Spear liked innocence , especially connected to Fer . A Jennifer-Timmy match had its charms . The genetic distance could be greater , but so what ? Spear 's great-grandparents were first cousins and some of their surviving offspring had lived into their nineties . Tim would be good to Fer , he 'd amuse her , iron out the tension of contending with legal sharks ; and she would steady him , make him sensible and businesslike . Also , she 'd bring him a decent income : even now , as a first-year associate , she made seventy-five thousand a year . <p> His first two days in San Francisco , Spear had time to himself . Fer worked till six or seven , and Hugh was n't flying in till Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't arriving till the z6th . Fine . Spear loved San Francisco . Once he got used to the hills , he loved walking past the lollipop-colored houses so amazingly canted on the hills ; he loved the domesticated exoticism of Asian neighborhoods , restaurants , knick-knack shops , temples . Twenty years alone in the Malibu hills , he hardly realized how much time went by without his seeing or even speaking to anybody on the phone . San Francisco was a party . <p> Fer had given him an early Christmas present , a ticket to the Exploratorium , the science museum . " There 's an exhibit you 'll love , Grandpa . People talk about love for three minutes , and you watch them on tape . And you can make a tape yourself . " <p> " Did you ? " Fer had fair skin , a terrific give-away for feelings . Her blush suggested more take-away than give-away . He was embarrassed . He never wanted to embarrass , let alone hurt her . What did she have to keep from him ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures who joked and gushed over each other . They were friends , people who relied on each other , and not just in emergencies . Or that 's the way it would be if they lived in the same city . But how little he 'd seen of her . He was n't busy , but she was : college , law school , work , a monthly phone call and a semi-annual visit left all the room in the world for ignorance of each other . " I 'd love to hear anything you 'd say . " <p> " If I knew more about it , maybe I 'd make one . " <p> " You 're the most lovable girl on earth . You know much more than you think . And you 'll know an awful lot more damn soon . Or a lot of men are dumber than I think . " <p> More blush . " At least I know I do n't hate you . " <p> " Hate ! That 's a subject neither of us knows much about . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his motel . ( Fer had offered him her bed- " I 'll take the couch " - but Spear needed space and solitude . Even in St. Louis , where his daughter had a large house , he often stayed in motels . ) Eleven o'clock , he had the bus almost to himself . It set him to thinking , first about the love tape . What three minutes would he leave behind for visitors , research psychologists , for Fer and Fer 's grandchildren ? He 'd spent hours looking at cardboard-backed daguerreotypes of his parents , grandparents and great-grandparents . Somewhere in them , him . And pictures were silent ; the tape would speak . <p> Love . <p> A word that contained-and concealed-much . Updike , one of Spear 's love authorities , did n't deal with love at all . If anything , the sexual adventures of his characters excluded love . Lovers were each others motifs , outlets , occasions of relief , exaltation , seductive and sexual virtuosity . Reading Updike , Spear realized how limited his own virtuosity had been , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banal . His feelings , though , had not been banal , or , if banal , still enormous ; yet he had never worked up a vocabulary for them . <p> The bus passed a huge sand-colored school . Spear glimpsed two chattering girls carrying violin cases ; one , the chief talker , strawberry-haired , alert , the other , a little comedian , face lit with reactive vitality . Beautiful . Whose granddaughters were they ? He thought of Jennifer 's other grandfather , Mauricio Abarbanel , a man he 'd seen only twice but for whom , even now , as the bus turned off Bay into Cervantes , he felt much affection . A charming , rosy man , thick with the old Europe between the two wars , a musician , born in Istanbul of Sephardic , Spanish-speaking parents . He 'd studied composition in Lausanne with Kurt Weill , been a choral and opera conductor in Aachen , Strelitz , Vienna , and Paris , then was Bruno Walter 's assistant in Berlin , where , in December 1932 , Walter had tipped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Salle Pleyel , he 'd heard Vive Hitler ! ' shouted from the balcony : he too was marked for death . He 'd taken off for Istanbul , then Melbourne , where he 'd spent five years doing Wagner one night , Verdi the next . " English singers , " he 'd told Spear . " All discipline and modesty . No temperament . Then , my big chance . Hah . Eddie Johnson invited me to the Met . A madhouse . All temperament , all stars . No modesty , no discipline . Two years I stood it , then Gott sei dank , St. Louis . Classes , a school . I taughtconductors , singers . America . The Heartland . Safety . Bliss . " <p> Out of rosy little Grandpa Arbarbanel poured stories about the European artists who had also enriched and given meaning to Spear 's life : Weill , Hindemith , Stravinsky , Schoenberg , Krenek ; Toscanini , Walter , Flagstad , Melchior ; Balanchine , Markova , Ashton ( these last two as English as he ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lang , Lubitsch , von Sternberg . Refugees , like Spear , artists whose art-and accents-slaked the hunger of the lonely , stuttering , birdwatching , English public school boy for beauty and grandeur . Mad for beautiful expression , praised but not supplied in his father 's Devonshire rectory , Spear nourished himself at the phonograph and in libraries . One day , at Cambridge , he heard a lecture about the German films of the twenties and he discovered his vocation . Two years later , he 'd emigrated to California . <p> In the early 1950s , Hollywood was thick with European refugees . ( Abarbanel himself had spent ten months conducting for Max Steiner . ) They were patronized , indulged , then ignored , by the older immigrants , the founders and bosses of the studios , who had turned into what the young critic Spear described in an early essay for The Film Quarterly , " Molochs of anti-creativity ; smirking flesh peddlers , sanctimonious semi-pedophiles , their sentimental mendacities kin to the debased Caesarism of Mussolini , the murderous Aryan myths of Adolf Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made its way from The Film Quarterly to the Nation and then to the Los Angeles Times . The ferocity that had brought it a small cult of readers gave way to more relaxed and benign-if not resigned-critical and historical overviews of the film world . Spear became respectable , a judge on award committees , a popular lecturer . ( Within weeks of arriving in California , his stutter had disappeared . ) Twenty years ago , he stopped writing and lecturing , bought a cabin in a Malibu canyon and moved there . Daughter Amelia , grown and flown , wife Vanessa dead , Spear turned slowly into a civilized semi-hermit . <p> 4 . <p> The Love Tape section of the Exploratorium was at the back of the enormous geodesic dome . No one appeared to be there , but Spear called into the darkness that surrounded the lit counter , " Anybody around ? " A door opened and out came a young man , perhaps Korean , his passive , if not sullen , face studded with acne . " Wan na make a tape ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " The man put on a light and pointed to a cubicle , in which there stood a pine table , a kitchen chair , a camera , stereo equipment , and rows of cassettes . " What background you want ? " <p> " Excuse me ? " <p> " Sea ? Mountains ? Meadows ? Country porch ? " <p> " Sea would be nice . " Spear sat , and was handed a card which explained that he was being instructed by an Explainer . <p> " What kind of music ? " <p> " Excuse me ? " <p> " Choose a musical background , R-and-B , country , rock , baroque . " <p> " Baroque sounds right for me . " <p> " Brandenburg Concerto Number 2 okay ? " <p> " Why not . " <p> The young man bent down and clipped a nail-sized microphone to the lapel of Spear 's blazer . " When I leave the room , a red light goes on . " He looked expectantly at Spear , who nodded his comprehension and faced the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brandenburg Concerto hit the room . Spear listened . Behind the glass , the Explainer behind the glass held up a sign : " T-A-L-K . " <p> " L-l-love , " stuttered Spear , " W-w-what do I mean by this thing called love ? " ' <p> 5 . <p> Christmas Eve , he and Jennifer were invited to the Christmas party of Shari Morgan , a fellow first-year associate at Schmidt , Barczyk &; Cole . <p> " Awfully nice of them to take us in , " said Spear . <p> " People are nice to waifs , well-to-do ones . Shari says they 're thrilled to meet my celebrity grandpa . " <p> " If I 'm their idea of celebrity , they must be pretty far out of things . " <p> " Shari 's dad 's read both your books . " <p> " Odd fellow . " But Spear was pleased and bought two bottles of Mumms Champagne for the party . <p> He was always surprised at how small San Francisco was , how quickly , compared to Los Angeles , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was intricately divided , and when Jennifer and her friends discussed going to this restaurant or that , they made it sound as complex as New York . <p> The Morgans lived in Presidio Heights . Shari drove for ten minutes and parked on another hill of three-story , gingerbread houses , which , because of the tilt , looked like a set from Caligari . <p> The Morgans , their cousins and friends , were merry , well set-up people , and , within minutes , made Spear feel that he and Jennifer were a necessary part of their Christmas , a part they 'd never wanted to do without again . Shari 's father , Howard , was a hearty sixty-year old businessman who 'd not only read Spear 's books but seemed to have memorized them . He quoted a wicked sentence Spear had written about Joan Crawford . Spear recoiled . " Did I misquote you ? " <p> " Probably not . " <p> " A ' sexual slime pit . ' I think you did the poor girl in . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Delightful , " said Morgan . <p> They sat in comfortable chairs by a log fire that shot gold bits into crystal bowls where cloves floated on red wine . Smiling charmers passed around silver platters of cookies and herbal what-nots . Stoked with wine , Spear blessed the hospitality , the humane , flattering businesspeople , lawyers , researchers , teachers , patrons of art galleries , concerts , book clubs , citizens of a sort he had n't known in all his Los Angeles years , at least not congregated in such familiar intimacy . <p> Shari , a bright-eyed , rapid girl , acted as Spear 's social secretary , bringing people , one after another , to his armchair . <p> " I feel like the Queen Mother . " <p> " King of the day , " said Jennifer , who was then hustled off by Shari to meet her brother Colin , a Pittsburgh lawyer . She settled them into a dark corner , which Spear could see only enough to make out Jennifer laughing and , later , shaking her forefinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes ago , they 'd never laid eyes on each other . <p> Over the years , Spear had met a few of Jennifer 's friends , but-he realized now-he 'd never seen her alone with a man . He knew next to nothing about the romantic , the sexual , part of her life . For all he knew , she was gay , though he stifled this thought . ( No point facing that till it was necessary . ) It was a comfort seeing her easy way with Morgan , who , God knows , might-Spear leapt , absurdly , ahead-pin his name on the next generation of Spears . <p> A sentence came to him-was it Hegel ? - something about " walking around in marital shoes . " It had to do with the mixture of lust and nest-hunger that Spear himself remembered feeling during his courtship . Jennifer seemed pinched by these shoes . ( He wore them for her as Cousin Hugh wore them for Timmy . ) <p> Down the long dinner table , Jennifer and Colin were side by side . Spear watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his hand stroke her hair . <p> 6 <p> Christmas morning , he walked-or , as he thought of and felt it , climbed up Filbert Street and had bacon and eggs with Jennifer in front of the little pine tree she 'd decorated the day before he came . <p> They telephoned her parents in St. Louis . When Spear hung up , he said , " Your mother sounded strange . " <p> " That 's not strange . " <p> " She keeps more and more of herself to herself . At least keeps it from me . " <p> " She 's a great concealer . I feel awful for her , but she wo n't accept sympathy . Not from me . " <p> " Or me . Not since she was a little girl . She was a happy little girl . " <p> " I do n't know if she 's happy or unhappy that I-we are n't in St. Louis . " <p> Spear refilled their coffee cups . " This is a wonderful Christmas . My father , your great-grandpa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially at Christmas , when the church was full . Even the atheists came , armed to the teeth , he felt , ready to ridicule him . Poor fellow was sick with self-doubt . I inherited that . I 'm so glad you did n't . " <p> " Did n't I ? " <p> Thinking of her head on Colin Morgan 's shoulder , he said , " I do n't think so . " <p> Jennifer brought him her present , an alpaca sweater , which he put on . " Am I a dreamboat ? " <p> " You know you are . " His presents for her were two new novels and four CDs , ( Mozart quintets and Barber 's Knoxville : Summer I 9 <p> " It 's too much , Grandpa . " She kissed his cheeks , then pulled him to his feet . " Almost noon . We have to fetch Hugh . " <p> 7 <p> Driving the Bayshore Freeway , he asked her what she thought of Colin Morgan . <p> " I liked him , Wish I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He comes out here only once or twice a year . " <p> " And ... " <p> " That 's my pattern . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Liking people who 're difficult-or impossible . I do n't know what Shari thought she was doing . Maybe she wants Colin to have a girl in every port . " <p> " My guess is that she wants the best for him . Which is you . " <p> " Oh Grandpa . " <p> 8 . <p> One day , Spear knew , age or illness would break his old cousin , but now , at seventy-five , Hugh seemed the Hugh he 'd always known . His silvery hair had enough red strands so Spear could still see him as a redhead . The blue eyes were clear , the laugh one that made everyone who heard it laugh . He was the son of Spear 's mother 's sister who 'd married an American soldier in I9I8 and joined him in Kansas City a year later . Hugh had gone to the University of Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd fought in North Africa , Sicily , and Italy . For him , they were great larks , full of girls , gambling fortunes , wonderful stories . Back home , he failed in several businesses and three marriages ; still , in the thousand hours Spear had spent with him , Hugh was never down . Ready for risk , cards , horses , roulette , wives , and travel . ( Taking off on the spur of a luncheon whim for Vegas , Paris , Nairobi . Everywhere , there were Hugh-friends , their houses , boats , money his . As his was theirs . At sixty , he had found his metier , importing and selling fine watches , which in the Hollywood of the mid-eighties became the conspicuously inconspicuous signs of power-wealth . Hundred thousand dollar Patek Philippes Calibres ' 89 , Chopard Imperiales , Rolex Oysters and Vacherons Constantins gleamed in the wrist hair of L. A. cento-millionaires . Three years ago , Hugh sold the business for four million dollars and now spent his life sailing a small yacht , playing squash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jacques Brel " - and taking attractive forty , fifty , and sixty year old women to spas , casinos , and bed . The only things he missed-he told his cousin-were the sexual vigor of his twenties and a grandchild . <p> Now in his beautiful plaid polo coat , Hugh embraced Jennifer and Spear , then a woman who 'd been his seat-mate on the plane . " No , I never saw her before . " They floated to the garage on a raft of his anecdotes . <p> " You 're what Santa should bring everybody , " said Jennifer . " You and Grandpa spoil me for other man . " <p> 9 . <p> The next night , the two old cousins followed the two young ones , Jennifer and Timmy , first ten , then twenty , finally fifty yards back , the young ones holding up while the elders huffed and puffed up and down Chestnut and Polk , Lombard and Larkin , till they gathered at the restaurant where the old ones tucked away half again as much risotto and chianti as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Hugh . He spooned up the abandoned half of his son 's tirami-su . <p> " Or put you in the morgue , " said Spear . <p> Ten years older than Spear , muffin-shaped , a cigar smoker and drinker , Hugh was n't bothered by the hills . " Of course , " Spear told himself , " He 's always been in motion , driving around , peddling his watches , golfing and gambling , skiing , screwing . He must have a heart like a city pump . " <p> Except for looks- " a sweet crumb off the muffin , " thought Spearred hair , blue eyes , small chin , stubbiness , no son seemed further from a father than Timmy . A drop-out from several colleges , he 'd been for the last ten years , as focused as his father was diffused . Hugh was loose , prodigal ; Timmy-as Spear saw him-was cautious , close , laconic , though charming in his quiet way , a good responder , a good smiler . Jennifer opened up around him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , thought Spear , than with Colin Morgan . <p> " Maybe it 's the cousinship , " Spear told Hugh . " A built-in equality . She does n't have to put on any airs . Not that she does much of that , but she 's told me how tense she gets taking depositions or arguing in court . Timmy 's such a nice fellow . How 's he doing ? " <p> This as they walked back to Jennifer 's , yards behind the two they hoped would get together . Yet both of them felt something askew in the cousinly pair ; even physically , the two of them did n't match . Jennifer was erect and inches taller ; Timmy was compact , a sloucher and ambler . The old cousins also sensed that within Timmy 's affection for Jennifer there was a discomfort about her professionalism and salary . Though he enjoyed doing what he did , and she did n't enjoy what she did , he seemed to register the worldly contempt for his hand-to-mouth , month-to-month existence . <p> " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't had to give him a nickel . He 's got plenty of work . Turns down jobs . Thinking of buying a little house in San Rafael . He just asked if I 'd drive up tomorrow to look at it . " <p> " I 'll go along if y ou like . Fer 's back at work , I 've got nothing doing . " <p> " I 'd love it , but his car 's a two-seater . Actually , I got the sense that he wants to tell me something . Probably wants money for the downpayment . Which I 'll gladly give him . " <p> 10 . <p> " Nothing to do with a downpayment at all , " said Hugh , two mornings later . He and Spear were dawdling over sausages and pancakes at a breakfast place on Columbus . Jennifer had gone off to the Embarcadero Center , and Timmy had driven down the peninsula for a gig in Palo Alto . " He did n't tell me what till we were on the Golden Gate . A view that absorbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after one of his concerts , he spent the night with a girl he 'd never seen before , a groupie . He saw her a couple of other times , liked her well enough , but that was that . He got a letter or two from her , nothing pressing , just affection . A few weeks ago , he had a note from her saying she thought he might like to know that she 'd had his baby ; she was n't asking for money or marriage , but she thought he was entitled to know . If he wanted to see the baby , that was fine with her . If he did n't , that was fine too . So , he went to see her . She lives in San Rafael , runs a bed and breakfast there . Anyway , that 's whom we went to see , that 's why he wanted only me to come . She 's a charming , pretty , very able girl , and the baby 's a beauty . Timmy 's crazy about him , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he intends to stick with her , be the baby 's father . " <p> " Astonishing . You have a grandchild . What you 've wanted for years . " <p> " I have , yes . A beauty . Not a Wallace , but-who knows ? " <p> " Will Timmy marry her ? " <p> " He does n't really know her . What he does know , he likes . She is n't asking one thing from him . She had to be talked into taking money from him . " <p> " She lives off this bed and breakfast ? " <p> " She had a couple of years at San Francisco State , some sort of office management program , so what she does every now and thenit 's temp work-is set up computer programs for small businesses , hardware stores , sport shops , independent service stations . She can do most of that at home and take care of the baby . Timmy could do worse . " <p> " You did . Frequently . " Spear pushed away his plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Timmy was not going to father his great-grandchildren . That was clear . <p> All through the day with Hugh , walking down to the wharves , looking at the seals lined up in rows like drunken choir-boys , nuzzling and shoving each other , or buying a mobile for Timmy 's son at Ghirardelli Square-poor exchange for the beautiful watch Hugh had given Jennifer-riding the cable car up to the Fairmont for tequila and gorgeous views , or playing gin back at Jennifer 's with his usual crazy luck , he felt a knot of nausea and sadness in his stomach . Lucky in cards , but not where it counted . Hugh had stumbled into his future , a Wallace in genes , if not name , whereas his beloved Jennifer was dancing the Catrinette . What was going to become of her ? Would she , like her grandfather-but thirty years prematurely-become a hermit ? From boyhood on , bicycling alone on the moors , hunting for birds , he knew he had an aptitude for solitude . When , with retirement and Vanessa 's death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for it . Jennifer would be ravaged by it , embittered and stunned , far more than her mother was by marriage . Jennifer was made to be with people , with companions , lovers , a husband . " Gin . " <p> " You get a fortune , " said Hugh . " Fifteen , nineteen , twenty-nine , forty-nine , fifty-two . And twenty-five for gin . " He scribbled on the score pad . " I 'm Schneidered . A hundred-and-fifty points . You win a fortune . " They played for a **27;607;TOOLONG " $19.75 . " <p> Spear loved his gin triumphs over Hugh , but not today . Even while he knew , rationally , that the thought was absurd , excessive , selfcentered , stupidly old-fashioned , almost psychopathic , he could n't shake off the vision of his wonderful granddaughter , alone , a tiny island in the immense , cold ocean of solitude . <p> 11 . <p> One March Saturday , Jennifer walked down to the Exploratorium to hear her grandfather 's love tape . It was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least half a day or spent more than half of it with Jack Cole , the partner with whom she 'd been sleeping the last three and a half months . ( One of the few Saturdays she 'd not spent with Jack , she 'd spent with Colin Morgan , in town to take depositions , the second time she 'd gone to bed with him , the first being when he 'd driven down late Christmas Eve the night they 'd met . ) <p> The Exploratorium was full of families . Even the Love Tape section was crowded . Jennifer was in no hurry . That morning , she 'd awakened thinking of her grandfather and , remembering the tape , was suddenly curious to hear and see it . While she waited in line , she put on headphones and listened to other tapes . The speakers were sentimental , inarticulate , dull . She drifted into her own tape ( which she 'd never make ) : the first time she 'd made love , in high school with Louis Fuzollo , the surprise and messiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael ; foggily she thought of the horrible 8th week abortion her senior year , followed by the months of depression-and abstinence , till , in Northhampton , the first beautiful relationship , her sophomore year , with Henry Greif , her Western Civ instructor . After that , there 'd been her Slut-Time : she 'd slept with a dozen boys from U. Mass and Amherst who 'd passed her around like a chain letter , though it was interesting , exciting-like a good miniseries full of plot turns and surprises . Junior year in Paris , she 'd been relatively celibate . There was a month with Ling Tsien , a SingaporeChinese at the Science Po ' who wanted to marry her , then , the bicycle tour through Gers to the Pyrenees , where she 'd slept in a tent with Jean-Michel Whatshisname . In law school , there was no time for anything but bouts of sheer relief- " getting the rocks off , the ashes hauled " - sleeping with fellow sufferers , the most interesting , a first and probably , last-Denise Solle , the blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was the phrase that came to her as she signed for Grandpa 's tape . <p> 12 . <p> A few days later in his cabin , Spear read Jennifer 's letter . <p> " Dearest Grandpa , <p> This morning I went to the Exploratorium and saw your tape . I must write you right away about it . It felt so odd with twenty-five other people listening and watching you while those waves rolled in behind your head on that Bach music . It did n't matter . Nothing mattered but you and what you said . I know too that there are all sorts of love in the world , and that the kind we have for each other is less intense than many . Still , I think that as long as I live , I will feel it and know there is nothing else like it . You say that you 've known it twenty-six years : so have I. Please God we 'll know it twenty-six more , and more than that . I will , even if you 're not there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the monitor with your face that I know so well talking to me , I felt very very lucky . <p> Thank you so much for giving me this , for being the grandfather you are . <p> Always , your <p> Fer . <p> Author Affiliation
