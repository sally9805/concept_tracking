<p> Let the nicotine skin-patch marketing wars begin . <p> Just in time for New Year 's resolutions , two pharmaceutical companies are stocking pharmacy shelves with the patches , which are designed to help smokers kick the habit by delivering a small but steady trickle of nicotine into the bloodstream . <p> In all , four corporate alliances are vying for the pocketbooks of the 16 million Americans who try to quit each year . And two of the four nicotine patches were developed in the Bay Area , the birthplace of skin patch technology . <p> At stake is a large market and profit margins as high as 80 percent . Analysts say nicotine skin patches could become a $ 350 million-a-year industry by mid-decade , and could grow much larger when the patches are sold over-the-counter rather than through prescriptions . <p> " This is an important new market that will accommodate a number of products , " says David Steinberg , analyst at Mehta and Isaly in New York . " Whoever gets to the market first is likely to carve out the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of Palo Alto , a pioneer in skin patches , and its Kansas City , Mo. - based marketing partner , Marion Merrell Dow Inc. , which sells Nicorette chewing gum . The alliance , which won approval to market Nicoderm in November , already has begun stocking pharmacy shelves . <p> Running a close second is Ciba-Geigy Corp. , the Swiss drug maker whose longtime alliance with Alza on other products has made it the most experienced marketer of skin patches . Ciba-Geigy 's Habitrol , which is licensed from a German developer , Lohman , was approved in December and also is on the market . <p> Next is a patch developed by Cygnus Therapeutic Systems Inc. , a Redwood City start-up that has the most to gain  --  or lose  --  from the outcome of the marketing battle . Nicotrol , Cygnus ' first product and the only 16-hour patch , is licensed to Kabi Pharmacia , the developer of Nicorette gum , and will be sold in the United States by Warner Lambert as early as February . <p> In last place is Elan Corp. , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part to delay their arrival on the market . Elan licensed its patch , called Nicolan , to American Cyanamid after losing its first marketing partner , Warner Lambert , to Cygnus . Even though Nicolan was the first to file with the FDA , approval is n't expected until February . <p> All four alliances are targeting the 16 million Americans who try to quit each year  --  about 30 percent of the 52 million smokers . If all those who try to quit each year used the $ 300 , three-month nicotine patch treatment , the market would be enormous . <p> So far the market has been limited . Nicorette gum , the only other prescription product for smoking , for example , has never exceeded $ 100 million in U.S. sales since it was introduced in 1984 . <p> Part of the problem is that physicians pay little attention to the smoking habits of their patients . Even though smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the United States , a 1987 study found that more than half of all smokers had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far fewer ever get advice on how to stop . <p> But analysts expect broader acceptance of skin patches . The marketing blitz for nicotine skin patches is likely to go a long way toward raising awareness among doctors about the need for smoking counseling , analysts say . <p> Moreover , skin patches are more " user friendly " than Nicorette gum , which must be chewed several times a day and can leave a foul taste and cause nausea . By contrast , skin patches are affixed to the upper body and left for 24 hours , or in the case of Cygnus ' patch , 16 hours . The patches contain a reservoir of nicotine that is steadily released through the skin into the blood . <p> Skin patches are better than pills for administering many drugs because drug levels in the blood are n't dependent on the body 's ability to metabolize them and because many patients forget to take drugs in pill form . Patches developed by Alza have been used for several drugs  --  including treatments for angina and motion sickness . <p> Unfortunately for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the four nicotine skin patches does the best job . Because the companies have defined " quitting " slightly differently , it is impossible to compare their effectiveness . Analysts and physicians say the " quit rates " do n't vary by much . <p> In a typical trial of 935 smokers conducted for Alza , for example , 61 percent of smokers using Nicoderm had quit at the end of of six weeks , and 26 percent had quit at the end of six months . <p> Nicotine patches are designed to wean smokers from their physical addiction over a 10 to 12 week period . With Nicoderm , for example , patients use patches with 21 milligrams of nicotine  --  equivalent to about three-quarters of a pack of cigarets  --  each day for the first six weeks , then scale down to 14 milligrams and seven milligrams in the final weeks . <p> Most of the products are designed to be used in conjunction with counseling to treat a smoker 's psychological addiction . <p> But the patches appear more variable in terms of side effects , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the least incidence of side effects , while Elan appears to have the most . Moreover , no one knows the effects of continuous doses of nicotine , a plus for Cygnus , which is used only during waking hours . <p> The more important advantage in the nicotine patch war , analysts say , is who gets to the pharmacy first . With little to distinguish the products , it is difficult to overtake a competitor 's lead once it has been established . And the first months on the market bring in very high sales as pharmacies stock their shelves . <p> Another factor is the sales and marketing forces that the companies send into doctors ' offices . By virtue of Nicorette gum , Marion Merrell Dow has the most experience selling smoking-cessation products , while Ciba-Geigy has the largest sales force , 1,000 in all , and the most experience selling skin patches . <p> As a result , Steinberg of Mehta and Isaly in New York expects Alza/Marion Merrell Dow to garner the largest market share ( 40 percent ) , with Ciba-Geigy following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 23 percent ) . Others see the race as a three-way tie , with Elan in last place . <p> COMPETITION IN THE NICOTINE PATCH MARKET <p> NICODERM <p> Developer : Alza Corp. , Palo Alto <p> Marketing partner : Marion Merrell Dow Inc. , Kansas City <p> Date approved : November 7 <p> Comments : Although Alza was the last to file for regulatory approval , it was the first to receive the Food and Drug Administration 's OK .
