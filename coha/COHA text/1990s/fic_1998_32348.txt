Prologue from The Halloween Man by Douglas Clegg The shattering of glass and metal , as some unseen intruder broke the window , did not wake him . A voice in his head whispered , " Your soul . " The boy shivered . The rain outside , and the wind that blew across the near-desolate room , across the old woman 's face as she too lay back in some dream , he knew this but none of it could draw him up from sleep ; the crunch and squeal of a door opening , of glass being stepped upon , all of this played at the edge of his consciousness , but he could not tug away from the dream that had grabbed him . The voice whispered , " Your heart . " His eyelids fluttered open for a moment , and then the boy closed them again , as if the real world were the dream , and his inner world , the truth . Even the mindpain was only a shredded curtain , blowing against a window of the dream . The boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , the one of insane geometries , of orange lightning , of fire that rained from trees like leaves falling , of the birds rising from the water their impossibly pure white wings spreading across the burning sky . As the sky filled with bloody swans , he saw the dark ram with its golden eyes shining as it galloped towards him across the surface of the unbroken water . Then the eels wriggling across the glassy surface , turning the brown water red with their wakes . The ram rode across their backs , its hooves beating like knives on stones . The Azriel Light came up from its breath , forming crystalline in the mist of air , and then burned across the world . What was unspeakable found voice and its bleating froze the air for a moment hacked from the fabric of time as the secret of all stabbed at his ears . Someone tried to wake him from it . The mindpain came back like a bolt of lightning , burning along his neural pathways . The boy 's eyes opened , his dream torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand over his mouth . The room came back with its shadows of curtains and half-opened cupboards . The trill of a mockingbird outside the window . The shroud of dawn . The room that always seemed too small for all of them . The others slept on around him . The man wore a dark leather jacket and jeans , his dark hair in need of a cut , and the smell from him was almost sweet  --  like sage on the desert after a rain . " You Satan ? " the boy asked in a hushed tone of reverence . Fear was not there . He did n't sense it . He did n't feel it from the man , and it was n't within him . He knew , somehow , the man would be there . He knew just as he knew that his dream had foretold something . " I could be , " the man whispered , his breath all cigarettes , " If you keep quiet , you 'll live . Understand ? " The boy nodded . The mindpain blossomed against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually did after one of the Great Meetings , it would blast within his head like the worst headache . Sometimes his nose would bleed from it . Sometimes he 'd go into convulsions . He never knew how hard it would hit , he just knew it was PAIN . He knew it HURT . The mindpain did n't let go until it was good and ready to . The boy felt something pressed against his side . Cold metal . " That 's right , " the man whispered . " It 's a gun . I will kill you if you make a noise or try to fight me . Or if you try to do what I know you can do . " The boy began shivering , and was n't sure if he could will himself to stop . He wanted to be back in his dream . It felt like ants were crawling all over his arms and legs . Ants stinging him all over , and then tickling along his neck . He wanted to swat and scratch , but he was afraid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jack rabbit get shot clean in half once . He did n't need to imagine it happening to himself . But the markings on him , the drawings ... He knew they were moving , the pictures on his shoulders . He wished he could scrape them from his flesh . He wanted to tell the stranger with the gun about them , about how they meant bad things when they began moving , but the boy knew this would do no good . The man grinned as he lifted the boy up , wrapping a shabby blanket around him . The boy 's last view of what he had come to call home was the old woman lying there staring at him . Blood sluiced from between her lips , and tears bled down in rivulets from her eyes . The mattress beneath her was soaked red . Her fingers were still curled around a small amulet she kept with her , nothing more than a locket , a good luck charm . The boy was too tired to fight , and weakened , too , by the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mindpain was like what the Great Father had called a hangover . It was the morning after . That was a problem for him , it sapped him of strength , and even when he had tried to kick out at the man , he could barely move his legs . The man would probably kill him . The boy knew this is what kidnappers usually did . He had watched late night TV shows like " America 's Most Wanted " and knew that kidnappers rarely kept a kid alive . The boy tried not to think of the gun . Tried to remember the Great Father holding his arms out , his hands open to him . " I will be your comfort in the valley of the shadow , " the Great Father had said . This was the valley of the shadow of death . This kidnapper and his gun and his blanket and the red stain on the mattress with the old woman 's mouth wide open . Thinking about it , the boy winced . The hammering in his head grew stronger . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed unbearable . It was a terrible rain , it had come at first as ice and then tiny pebbles hitting the corrugated tin roof , until finally , it was just water . God is pissin ' on us on accounta our sins , that 's what the old woman who took care of him would say , her Texas twang increasing with her years . She was dead now . She was in whatever Great Beyond existed , the boy knew . She was in the pictures that covered him now , as were all things that were no more . If the mindpain had n't descended that night , weakening him further , he might 've been able to struggle against this evil man who took him . Even though the blanket covered the boy 's ears , it was as if the hoofbeats of wild horses were beating down upon him from heaven . The kidnapper threw him into the backseat of a car . Slammed the door . As they drove off , the boy glanced back at the place he 'd called home and knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawn was just bursting from the far horizon . Rain accompanied it , the first fresh drops hitting the car windows , dirt rinsing down . The pain in the boy 's head grew , and he could feel the tingling begin along his back and shoulders . He knew that whatever was supposed to start , all the things that he 'd been warned about by the Great Father , would come to pass now . Through him , the radiance would come , like electricity through the idiot wires of the gods . His skin felt molten .  - -  From The Halloween Man , by Douglas Clegg .
