The late Dorothy Dandridge finally gets the respect owed her // IT WAS THE BIGGEST BREAK OF HER Hollywood career , and Dorothy Dandridge was on the verge of losing it . Acclaimed director Otto Preminger was casting his all-black production of Carmen Jones in 1954 , and Dandridge , a nightclub singer with a sultry act , considered herself perfect for the title role-a seductress whose fiery passions bring tragedy to a Florida factory town . Preminger , however , thought otherwise : " Every time I look at you I see Saks Fifth Avenue , " he said after Dandridge arrived for an interview in a prim blue dress . Dandridge begged for a second meeting ; this time she sauntered into Preminger 's office wearing a slit skirt , a tousled wig and a revealing blouse . " My God , " roared the director , electrified . " It 's Carmen ! " Grace Kelly may have won the Oscar for 1954 , but Dandridge made history that year . Her Best Actress nomination for Carmen Jones was a first for an African-American . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she caused a sensation when she arrived at 1955 's Cannes Film Festival . For a moment in the mid-50s-before family tragedy , bad relationships , pills and , above all , Hollywood racism sapped her career-Dandridge seemed poised to become the first nonwhite actress with truly universal appeal-a black Marilyn Monroe . Instead by 1965 , when she died at 42 , possibly a suicide , with only $2.14 in the bank , the public had largely ignored her . That may change , thanks to a new , richly detailed book , Dorothy Dandridge : A Biography , by Donald Bogle , and to two separate film projects being developed by actresses Halle Berry and Whitney Houston , both devoted Dandridge admirers . " She 's such an important figure , " says Berry . " I 'm proof of that . Every black actress who is working in Hollywood is proof of that . " Indeed , when the 8-year-old Dandridge arrived in Los Angeles from Chicago in 1930 , most of the film roles open to African-Americans were as menial extras .

With the help of her lover , a harsh-tempered woman named Geneva " Neva " Williams ( Ruby had separated from her husband , draftsman Cyril Dandridge , in 1922 ) , Ruby had already molded Dorothy and her older sister Vivian into a singingand-acrobatics act called the Wonder Children . " I remember sleeping four in a single bed " touring black churches in the South in the ' ' 20s , Dorothy would later recall . In L.A. in the early ' ' 30s , Ruby added a third singer to the act and enlisted then-unknown Nat Cole ( he had yet to acquire the nickname " King " ) to polish it . The girls found steady work in nightclubs and bit parts in movies , including the Marx Brothers ' 1937 A Day at the Races .

" She was luscious , " says cabaret singer Bobby Short , 72 . " Dorothy never had a great voice , but she had lots and lots of personality . Audiences were wild about her .

Dandridge and Preminger fell in love , but their affair had ended bitterly by the time she worked for him again in 1959 's Porgy and Bess . " Otto was cruel to everyone , but he was particularly cruel to her on that film , " says Nichelle Nichols ( Star Trek 's Lieutenant Uhura ) , who had a bit part in Bess .
