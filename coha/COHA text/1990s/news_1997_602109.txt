<p> Electronic stock trading is attracting thousands of new customers every day . To find out how electronic trading works  --  or does n't work  --  USA TODAY technology reporter James Kim opened an account and did some buying and selling . He started with $ 1,000 . To find out what he end up with , read his report : <p> He started with $ 1,000 . To find out what he ended up with , read his report : Buying stocks on line is really simple  --  much of the time . <p> To start , most on-line brokerages require you to send in an application and a check by regular mail . I decide to set up an account with E*Trade Securities , a well-known Internet brokerage . I fill out an application on line , print it and send it Federal Express with a check . Typically , E*Trade will mail back your user name , password and account number , which can take a week or so . Or you can call for the information . <p> After being approved , I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navigator 3.0 , and type in the address of the E*Trade site , punch in my user name and password , and start hunting for stocks . <p> I am interested in one called CompuMed ( ticker:CMPD ) . I punch in the ticker symbol and get a price quote of $ 2 . Then , I click on the symbol to get news about the company , provided free by E*Trade . Turns out it has just announced a tool to help diagnose osteoporosis and arthritis . Sounds good . <p> Next , I check out Novell ( NOVL ) , the software maker . But the company news says CEO Eric Schmit declared the company was not for sale . I nix it , and move on to @Home ( ATHM ) , a cable modem and service company . CS First Boston recently issued a " buy " recommendation ; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was " neutral . " But I think demand for fast cable modems will be huge soon . <p> So , with a click of my mouse , I call up E*Trade 's page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fill in a form asking to buy 188 shares of CompuMed at the market price quoted . After previewing my order , I click on " place trade . " Almost instantly , I get a message saying the order was logged . In a few minutes , I get a message confirming my purchase . <p> I repeat the process to buy 25 shares of @Home at $ 18 . All told , pretty painless , on a day when the market is active , not frenzied . The most annoying thing : My Netscape Navigator 3.0 keeps warning that it is low on memory . <p> Later , I check my stocks . They are up , and I am having fun . After the market closes , I decide to leave orders to sell both stocks when the market opens in the morning . <p> Sure enough , when I call up my account , the stocks are sold , at $ 2 and $ 193/4 . <p> Next I decide to buy Duramed Pharmaceuticals ( DRMD ) , which makes generic drugs . E*Trade says there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click to see it , the most recent article is Aug. 15 . That 's annoying , but I enter an order to buy anyway : 92 shares at $ 5 , the real-time " bid . " <p> Uh-oh ! When I preview the order , I am told I ca n't buy the stock in such fractions . Maybe a traditional discount broker would have been able to get me the stated bid price . Anyway , I change my order to a market order to buy the stock at the prevailing price , and I soon get confirmation that I bought 92 shares at $ 5 , just a sixteenth above the price I wanted  --  a total of $ 5.75 more than I wanted to spend . <p> Later in the day , the market is plunging . My stocks are dipping . And I am back at the computer plotting strategy . I am not too concerned about the costs of trading , though with a portfolio of only $ 1,000 ( the most USA TODAY would cough up ) , those $ 20 hits hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't show up in my portfolio summary quickly . I have to call up a " transaction history " and pull out a calculator to see exactly how I am faring . <p> But all in all , I am surprised by the smoothness of the process . I had trolled investor chat sites on the Internet and America Online and read many accounts of people with poor experiences . Some I talked to said Internet trades are slow when market activity is heavy . <p> But I feel emboldened . It 's fun . And I can see why people say Internet trading can be addictive . If I can keep from being a market-timing , Net-trading , sweat-pouring junkie who lives or dies with every Web delay , I think I will be just fine . Right now , however , I am puzzling in front of the computer again . After Thursday 's sell-off , I 'm down more than $ 300 , including commissions . Yikes ! <p> Trading on line requires just as much homework <p> Here are some tips to keep in mind if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Choose wisely . There are more than 40 Internet-based brokers . And their services and prices vary widely . If you already have an account with a discount brokerage , chances are good that it will let you trade your account on line . And , of course , no law says you ca n't have accounts with more than one company . Some on-line brokers , such as Datek Securities , focus on low commissions . Others , such as Pacific Brokerage , offer a Web site with few graphics to let you trade as fast as possible . E*Trade , while offering low commissions , also is trying to become a provider of a full menu of on-line financial services . <p> Start here . A great place to go before you start is a Web site run by Gomez Advisors ( gomezadvisors.com ) , which ranks Internet brokers . Also check the Online Financial Network ( ofns.com ) , which has current information on the industry . <p> Research . All the rules that apply to investing in general apply to Internet-based trading . Just because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do it with less caution . Be especially wary of information in chat rooms that could come from anywhere . Take advantage of the company information and basic investing advice offered on the Internet . Some sites to start at : Yahoo 's financial area ( yahoo.com ) , Motley Fool ( fool.com ) and the American Association of Individual Investors ( aaii.com ) . If you are willing to pay a monthly fee , good information and real-time quotes are widely available on the Web . <p> Understand the Internet . Many people automatically blame their broker if there is a technical problem trading via the Web . In truth , problems using a Web site can occur anywhere from your PC modem to the Internet service provider , to the many Internet connection points along the way , to the server running the broker 's Web site . You might call your brokerage for tips on speeding access . Often , E*Trade and others can make concrete suggestions . You should n't expect Internet quirks to disappear just because you have money at risk . <p> Internet trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Web address , Price per Name www. trade Ceres Interactive ceres.com $18 CompuTEL Securities rapidtrade.com $11.50 to $21.50 Datek Securities datek.com $9.99 Discover Brokerage lombard.com $14.95 ( market order ) ; Direct $19.95 ( limit order ) up to 5,000 shares eSchwab eschwab.com $29.95 up to 1,000 shares E*TRADE etrade.com $14.95 for listed stocks ; $19.95 for OTC stocks up to 5,000 shares Fidelity Investments fidelity.com $28.95 up to 1,000 shares PC Financial Network pcfn.com $20 up to 1,000 shares Pacific Brokerage tradepbs.com $15 Quick &; Reilly quick-reilly.com $14.95 ( market order ) ; Quickway Net $19.95 ( limit order ) up to 1,000 shares Waterhouse Web Broker webbroker.com $12 up to 5,000 shares <p> Source : companies listed
