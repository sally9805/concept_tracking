Prologue 4th Precinct Patrolman William F. Sievers 7 June , 1995 I was investigating a stolen car complaint when a woman from down the block asked me if I could stop by her apartment house later . After finishing up with the stolen car , I went down to see the woman . She lived in one of the old Victorians on the corner of 34th Street and D Avenue where a lot of university students , a lot of poor blacks , and a lot of drug dealers live . The woman said the apartment manager would n't do anything about the stench in the apartment next to hers and would I check it out . I got the manager to give me the key and that 's when I found the girl in the bedroom . * * * 8 July , 1995 She came almost every night now , and always did the same thing , just stood there in front of the shabby Victorian that not even the moonlight could save , and stared up at the window of the apartment where she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood knew who she was , of course ; her name was Alison . She 'd lived among them for a good while , an earnestly pretty girl with big somber eyes and a quick sad smile . Sometimes it rained but the girl came anyway , not seeming to notice when she got soaked , not even seeming to notice when one of the old black women came up to her and said , ' Darlin ' why do n't you come inside and let me make you some coffee ? ' The girl was always grateful for the kindness but never accepted it . She just wanted to stand here , watching , remembering . Hot angry summer gave way to chill solemn autumn , and then the girl did n't come quite so often , nor stay quite so long . The old ladies who watched her from their windows had despaired of helping her . All they could do was wonder why she came back here , what she was hoping to learn by standing down there on the sidewalk , frail as a child , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rented since the murder . What could she possibly want here ? * * * 4th Precinct Patrolman William F. Sievers 7 June , 1995 I guess the thing I noticed right away , even before I took a good long look at her wounds , was her face . She looked a lot like my little sister , Janice . And I got scared . I wanted to get on the phone and call my Mom back on the farm and make sure that Janice was all right . She was sixteen now and driving and going out with boys , and these days girls can get in a lot of trouble . The young woman was sprawled on her back on the bed . She had blonde hair so you could plainly see where somebody had smashed in the left side of her skull . A fly sat on the wound making angry buzzing noises . She 'd also been cut up pretty bad . Her hands lay open so you could see the defense wounds in the palms , where she 'd been trying to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . I guess because she resembled my sister so much , I had a hard time looking between her parted legs . Women always look so vulnerable down there . There was heavy red blood on the inside of both her thighs . She 'd probably been raped . I wondered if she 'd been alive when it had happened . I wanted to cover her , cover her sex if nothing else , give her a little bit of dignity , but I 'd done that on another homicide investigation and the detectives chewed my ass off for altering the crime scene . So all I could do was say a quick little prayer for her . I went downstairs and called in the precinct and told them what had happened and how we 'd need Homicide and an ambulance and the medical examiner . Then I dug in my wallet and pulled out three ones and laid them next to the phone and said to the lady who 'd asked me to investigate , ' I 'm leaving the money here for a long-distance call . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when I told her what had happened and how the dead woman looked so much like Janice , Mom said , ' Honey , do you really want to be a policeman ? Why do n't you get out of that city and come back here and work the farm with your Dad ? ' Then she assured me that Janice was just fine helping Dad work in the north pasture . I felt a lot better , then , you know , about my sister Janice . I went back upstairs to guard the crime scene , but I stood outside the door . I just did n't want to see the dead woman again . Right now working in the north pasture , with all those beautiful chestnut horses running in the hills , sounded pretty darned good . * * * 15 October , 1995 Sometimes , one of the neighbors would remember the odd white girl who 'd stood vigil all summer outside the apartment house where she 'd lived before her friend had been murdered . Wonder whatever happened to her ? the neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . Skinny little girl . And those big sad eyes . Wonder whatever happened to her , anyway ? Winter came early that year , and with it another murder on the block , a drunken white husband beating his fourteen-year-old daughter to death for letting one of the neighborhood black kids have sex with her . A good grim story to be savored and cherished by all the neighborhood people ; a story so good , so grim that it made them forget about the summer 's murder , and the girl with the big solemn eyes standing vigil even in the rain .
