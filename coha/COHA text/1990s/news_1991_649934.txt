<p> Thursday I turned to soap opera . Yes , I felt slightly ashamed . The war was still running full time on CNN , and patriots , I suppose , should stay glued to the screen at such times . <p> Still , our side 's brass obviously wished everybody would go away and leave them alone . You could n't blame them . Running a war must be delicate business . The people in charge were certainly making it clear that they 'd rather not have busybodies leaning over their shoulders or , for that matter , hunkered over TV sets back home dying to know what was going on in the desert . <p> So I tuned over to Happy Valley . Or is it Pine Valley ? Whatever it 's called , it should be renamed Love Valley , because it is the home office of love , love , love . <p> Since I had spent eternities watching military brass refuse to explain anything , Love Valley was an exciting new world . In Love Valley everybody was , as usual , explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , are not like the things people explain in places less seized of love . At my house , for instance , somebody is always explaining why he forgot to pick up a jar of capers at the supermarket or how she got a stick of butter mashed into the car seat . <p> A typical Love Valley explanation was going on when I tuned in Thursday . Mac was explaining to his wife , Selma , that his sexual congress with Jeannine was conducted for the noblest of purposes ; that is to say , to provide Jeannine with a baby that might save her marriage to sterile Dave . <p> ( Real Love Valley names have been changed here to conceal the fact that I can never remember them , all my mental powers being exhausted by trying to keep up with who is in love with Who . Which illustrates , by the way , why pedantic grammarians hate the place : There is no Whom in Love Valley . There used to be , but he was always too busy going to the store for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town on a rail by people afraid he 'd ruin the neighborhood . ) <p> Sterile Dave was not taking Jeannine 's putative pregnancy well . I thought he looked as sulky about it as the war reporters looked about colonels treating them like pariahs . You could tell Dave really loved Jeannine , though , and that they really needed a baby so their love for each other could flourish . <p> Meanwhile , young Sam was explaining to his pal Gomer why he was drinking rotgut whiskey from a pint bottle : Eunice , the girl he loved , was in love with another man . The loss of his love had Sam in such a stew that he looked capable of taking bloody vengeance on Eunice 's new lover if he learned his identity . <p> Well , this being Love Valley , his identity was not long concealed from us , the audience . Lo , we saw Eunice between the sheets with her new amour . Though Eunice 's hairdo looked fresh from the beauty parlor , they have obviously just had congress and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And who is Eunice 's new lover ? It is Pete ! And here is the beauty part : Pete is the father of Sam . Though Pete the Dad loves Sam the Son and Sam loves Pete as a son surely should , the filial part of this manly love will be destroyed if Sam learns that his rival is his own father . <p> I was sent to the market for a jar of capers before the hour ended , so do n't know if Sam finally burst into Eunice 's bedroom , discovered his dad and denounced him as a viper . <p> It was good , nevertheless , to be back in Love Valley with everyone devoting 20 hours a day to courtship , marriage , seduction , adultery , divorce , congress , kidnappings by rapacious love-crazed suitors , good heart-to-heart talks about love and embittered speeches to one another as well as to crowded rooms about the incessant betrayals of love . <p> Oh , it 's not absolutely all love there , of course . There are mean people , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor , recently had a cerebral hemorrhage so severe that I concluded he had asked for a raise and was being written out of Love Valley . <p> Maybe while hospitalized , Victor decided he could get by on last year 's salary after all . In any case , the love of a good Love Valley woman not only pulled him through , but also left him unhindered by the disabilities that commonly afflict stroke patients . He is now as mean as ever and fit for love in all its variations . <p> Another curiosity about Love Valley : No one watches the war on television . Nobody even seems to have a TV set , look at a newspaper or go to the store for a jar of capers . Pentagon , here is your dream of Paradise .
