YOU 'RE finally ready . After years of patience and preparation , you 're finally ready to have a baby . Ever since you were a teenager daydreaming in health class , you 've fantasized about having your own family . And just as you 've charted other major aspects of your life , such as your education and career , you have also prepared for this major milestone . Now , you want to do everything possible to ensure that your baby will be born healthy and will live a happy , emotionally well-adjusted childhood . You already know that your pregnancy and a child 's formative years are important in that process . But exactly how does a parent make the first years count ? You are already on the right path , according to physicians and child development experts , because parents of planned babies tend to be better prepared , physically , mentally and emotionally , for the rigors of pregnancy and parenthood than the parents of " oops " babies . " Ideally , all of us physicians would like to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chicago internist , " because planned pregnancies tend to have less complications . " If you 're planning to have a baby you should first have a thorough physical examination , explains Dr. Daniels . Your doctor will want to assess your nutritional health and run tests to make sure you do n't have any hidden medical conditions . You will probably receive counseling about what to expect throughout your pregnancy and advice about the lifestyle changes you will have to make . Physicians are generally in agreement that all illegal and most over-the-counter drugs , cigarettes and alcohol can do irreparable harm to your unborn child . " There are some rigid physicians , " says Dr. Daniels , " like myself who feel that all drugs should be excluded from pregnancy . And since alcohol is a drug , that should be excluded , too . " Increasingly , doctors are encouraging their patients to maintain healthier lifestyles , whether they 're pregnant or not . So , if you have n't been eating nutritionally and exercising regularly , now 's the time to start . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Daniels , " you 'll get all the essential vitamins necessary to sustain not only pregnancy but normal health as well . " And while you do n't want to exercise as if you 're training for the upcoming Olympics , he says daily leisurely walks should benefit delivery . " Your child can only be as healthy as you have been , " he says , " and good health is not something you stumble upon ; it 's something you really have to plan . " Okay  --  so far so good . You 've learned what to do to ensure both a safe delivery and a healthy child . After the arrival of your baby , Dr. Truddie E. Darden , associate professor and interim chairperson of the department of pediatrics at the Morehouse School of Medicine , says it 's just as important that a child begins to immediately receive care from a pediatrician as it was for his or her mother to receive quality prenatal care . Dr. Darden says a qualified pediatrician will make sure your child is properly immunized , monitor his or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or she will also help you make some important decisions such as whether or not to breast-feed . Breast-feeding has resurged in popularity as clinicians have learned more about its nutritional value . Mothers should " hold their babies , talk to them and if they are healthy enough to be breastfed , " says Dr. Merceline M. Dahl-Regis , director of the Child Development Center at Howard University College of Medicine , " breast-feed them very early . " Dr. Dahl-Regis says the shared warmth and closeness provided by breast-feeding also promotes bonding between mother and child and stimulates a baby emotionally . A newborn , accustomed to the warmth and security of the womb , needs the emotional comfort and physical nurturing that only holding can provide , says Dr. Darden . But many parents hesitate to hold their babies unnecessarily because they are afraid they will " spoil " them . " I really , firmly believe that children , particularly infants , can not be spoiled , " says Dr. Darden . " People define spoiling in different ways but you should not confuse it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly during those early , early months . " When Dr. Darden and her husband , Alvin III , brought their own daughter , 3-year-old Kelsey , home from the hospital , they assumed her expertise would make their transition into parenthood easier . But in retrospect , she says , " you can read about childrearing ... but when it comes to putting it into practice with your own children , it is not often easy . " A little more prepared after Alvin IV was born 5 months ago , she says , " One needs to recognize that you need to have a little bit of patience and flexibility and that every child is different . " As babies become toddlers , the differences in their personalities become more distinct . Each child will develop at his or her own pace . Dr. Dahl-Regis says parents can monitor whether or not their child is developing normally by educating themselves on what is appropriate for his or her age group . " One must understand what are age-appropriate expectations in every category , " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developmental stages and manage accordingly . " For instance , around 2 or 3 years of age , children normally begin to mimic adult behavior . This is an excellent time for them to begin learning personal responsibility , says Dr. Darden . Have them pick up their toys after playtime and put things away they 've taken out of place . If someone else is always there to pick up or children , she says , " then they go on with the expectation that mother or dad or someone will do that for them and that same kind of behavior will exist later . " Making those first years count is crucial to the success of a child 's future development . Prospective parents should begin preparing for a healthy baby even before conception . And parents should be more concerned with bonding with their newborns than they are with spoiling them . A toddler 's parents should begin teaching personal responsibility even before the child gives up diapers . " Much of the behavior that we 're looking at today is taught or learned behavior , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must do it early . " <p>
