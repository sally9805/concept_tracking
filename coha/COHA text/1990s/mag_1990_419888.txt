Section : watercolor PAGE <p> Watercolor is versatile and suits my personality , which is colorful and spontaneous : I enjoy a formal evening just a much as putting on jeans and digging in my garden . The medium allows me to experiment so I can best express my moods , and it enables me to depict brilliant color and warm sunlight <p> The questions I am most often asked about my work are how I achieve the liveliness in my paintings and what color combinations I use . My answer to both questions is that being a colorist , I command a diverse palette . I can not discipline myself to paint the same subject or to use the same palette over and over again . For me , the thrill of each new creation is like a journey being led by sunlight , shadows , and color . <p> Some people seem to correlate spontaneous watercolor with painting quickly , but I find that the more I experiment , the more I slow down my painting . I used try to complete a full sheet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slower pace . Free-flowing brush movements and spontaneous applications of color allow me more time to think carefully and make intuitive decisions while working . <p> My best work comes from making loose-flowing , unconfined brush movements over a fairly detailed drawing . I use a one-inch flat brush for most of my first wash , holding it somewhat far back on the handle so my strokes are flowing and long rather than short and choppy . My brushes are a No. 1 flat Morilla Nos. 10 and 12 round Strathmore kolinsky Series 585 , and Nos. 8 and 2 Langnickel kolinsky rounds . I use a Grumbacher slant palette and a porcelain butcher 's tray . I paint my first wash loosely , trying to unify color , cover the entire paper , and say as much as I can early in the painting process . Later , I come in with a more controlled network of brush marks and glazes and reestablish the darks . I usually work from the top of the paper down and use a slanted board , which allows the colors to mingle and run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean my butcher-tray pudding my board in various directions . Quick , short sprinkles of water from a pump-spray bottle add mystery and texture in backgrounds , foreground shadows , snow , flowers , foliage , and reflections . <p> I also keep my paintings lively by varying subject matter . Subjects seem to just jump out and grab me , so I never leave the house without my camera . I am constantly searching for interesting people to paint at flea markets , on trips , and at baseball games . I love the candid , natural feeling of two old-timers talking over a game or of children innocently playing together . When I am commissioned to do a portrait painting , I shoot three or four rolls of film of the parson in his or her natural setting . I can easily take a roll of one subject , but very likely only one shot will stir an emotional response . I feel it is important that the subject be doing something he or she really enjoys such as reading , gardening , being involved in a sport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of day and the temperature of the light have a great deal to do with how shadows are cast on a subject . When doing a portrait , I try to achieve soft facial shadows ; harsh shadows tend to make a person look too serious or too old . Children are the most difficult to capture on film ; however , if you can get them to discuss their doll or comic-book collections , their innocence always breaks through . <p> Once I am ready to paint , there are several surfaces I might choose from , all of which are excellent for diffusing color in shadows and for achieving soft and crisp edges . I most often use Strathmore Crescent 114 board and Arches 300-pound cold-pressed paper , working on full sheets and larger ones . I constantly experiment with new paper surfaces , observing how pigments will react . I begin with compositional thumbnail sketcher and then go into a value sketch . After drawing directly on the paper with an HB pencil , I sometimes do a very quick study to decide palette choices . For painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot-pressed 300-pound Arch , es paper . I again work out the composition with rough sketches ; then I decide on the best choice and draw a very detailed drawing , carefully measuring every feature to get a likeness . <p> When I am pleased with a drawing , I either redraw it directly on the board or , if the pose is a three-quarter full sheet , lightly trace it onto the Bristol board , which helps me place it accurately . Bristol board has a very slick , shiny surface and I would rather make all my errors and marks on my drawing paper rather than directly on the delicate painting surface ; overly erased areas on the paper can affect the behavior of the pigment . After lightly tracing on the Bristol board , I redraw the features and make final corrections , putting in enough detail and light . I tape this drawing to my drawing board to begin painting . After the drawing is complete , I decide whether I will paint around areas I want to remain white or use maskoid to protect them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I keep pure pigment and detail near the center of interest . I like grainy pigments , such as cobalt violet , manganese blue , and cerulean blue , especially for mixing , and I rarely mix than two or three colors together . Often I mix two colors on the rather than on the butcher 's tray . Also , I avoid mixing two cadmiums together since they can become too opaque , and I mix my own browns to keep the palette pure and translucent . I mostly avoid using staining colors ; however , some are necessary . <p> For example , viridian used judiciously can be effective for skin shadows . <p> For portraits I use yellow ochre , Antwerp blue , French ultramarine , alizarin crimson , cadmium red , Winsor red , Indian red , viridian , cobalt blue , new gamboge , olive green , and cerulean blue , all by Winsor &; Newton. , 4 find that new gamboge mixed with any of the reds mentioned above gives painted skin a lovely glow . After several years of playing with color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well together for landscapes and floras : cadmium orange , Winsor yellow , aureolin , raw sienna , cadmium red , alizarin crimson , manganese blue , cobalt blue , cerulean blue , new gamboge , and occasionally mauve or Winsor violet . For flowery subjects I add Holbein 's permanent magenta , Opera , and rose madder . I have also found that Liquitex cobalt violet mixes well with most pigments , that cerulean blue combined with most reds makes a delicate shadow , and that a combination of alizarin crimson , raw sienna , and mauve makes a rich , strong , dark color . <p> Discipline and organization are key factors in my painting . Fortunately , I have a fairly even-tempered , happy personality ; however , negative forces and daily frustrations can easily stop the positive flow of creativity . In my life I try to balance spiritual growth , family , good friends , exercise , and painting , so I mentally and physically pump myself up before a three- to five-hour painting session . I always try to get a good night 's sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , and several times a week I work out before I paint to relieve tension and stress . When painting , I wear good gym shoes and a loose sweat suit and listen to a variety of music , depending on my mood . I have five large skylights in my studio , and even on a cloudy day I have plenty of natural light . Facing the paper always makes me nervous , but every time I make that first stroke , I fall in love with watercolor all over again . Total concentration is imperative . I do not answer the phone or allow myself to be interrupted while painting . No one ever told me how much paperwork , organization , and promotion of oneself is required in this erratic fine-arts business . Since painting has taken over so much of my life , I have had to make decisions and commitments ; discipline has ended many of my social activities and diminished my free time . <p> Friends , though , have been very important to my creative growth . After graduating from the American Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin my art career and I was fortunate to have a few knowledgeable , sincere friends to give me some direction . I also relied on my common sense and worked as hard as possible . I soon realized how competitive the art world has become and I decided to compete in terms of my own personal growth rather than be affected by frustrations and rejections imposed by the art world . Rather than concentrating solely on myself and on my career , I regularly spend time visiting the hospitalized and handicapped , which has helped me put my painting career in perspective . I am thankful each time I am able to hold a brush or teach a student rather than obsessively concentrating on my own personal ego and level of achievement . In essence , I draw my strength from my belief in God . <p> Having a variety of friends has been important to me as well , for I find that friends can add a humorous dimension to my work . During one of her workshops , for example , Judi Betts suggested I allow my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasional feelings of loneliness I sometimes felt . It seemed like a good idea ; they were n't going to interrupt me , and aside from eating a few Incredible Nibs and fighting over sunspots , they were rather soothing company . But one day I did n't realize that they had followed me to the sink for fresh water , and as I quickly turned around , with two huge half-gallons of cold water , I tripped and spilled both containers all over them ! Needless to say , my dogs do not show up in my studio on a regular bags anymore , and when they do , if I go to the sink they quietly walk out of the room . <p> I feel I am a product of several different artists and friends whose work and character I also admire : Catherine Wilson Smith , Richard Nichols , Nita Engle , Judi Betts , Chuck Schenk , Pamela Swanson , Bill Kaufman , and Joe Fettingis . I am very fortunate to have been able to study with such talented people . I am also grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She taught me the value of how building layers of color can carve out facial planes an , opened my eyes to new surfaces and color experimentation . I also find teaching a class once a week very rewarding . It is exhilarating to see the weekly progress in my students and pass on what has been instilled in my development as an artist . <p> I feel as though I have fad the best of both worlds  --  being able to raise three wonderful kids aid then return to school and achieve a fine-arts degree . Juggling the role of a full-time student with the responsibilities of having a husband , teenagers , and a home was a challenge I thought I 'd never surmount . However , the dedication , integrity , and discipline of studying under such a master of watercolor as Irving Shapiro was an inspiration to me and it kept me on track . Shapiro taught me that in itself all the technical knowledge and expertise one uses to make art is not enough , the artist is required to put self anti soul into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has rubbed off on the entire family in numerous ways .

My husband has been in the automotive business for twenty-two years ; in the past , when driving in the car together , he was constantly noticing gas prices , tune-up specials , and locations , but now he makes such comments as " Look ! Great shadows ! " Being married to a supportive man who never makes me feel guilty about the price of good paint and quality brushes has helped my creative growth . Fortunately , my search to express myself has been nurtured by a family that understands that self and soul that I put into each painting . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Shimmering Harbor , 1989 , watercolor , 29 x 21 .
