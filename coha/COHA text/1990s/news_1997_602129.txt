<p> DENVER  --  The Orange Crush is feeling blue . The Broncos have dominated the Mile High sports scene for more than three decades , but serious cracks are forming in the bond between team and town . <p> Denver 's first major league franchise is still its most beloved , but the devotion that once drove fans to paint their homes Broncos orange has been diluted by recent competition from the city 's successful hockey and baseball teams , restricted access to home games and a nasty battle over a new stadium that has included threats to move the team . <p> " I 'm not trying to blackmail the city , " majority owner and CEO Pat Bowlen says . <p> " But it is obvious that we ca n't continue to play at Mile High Stadium for very much longer . " <p> He points out that the Dallas Cowboys get $ 45 million a year from Cowboys Stadium concessions and parking . <p> The Broncos get nothing from city-owned Mile High . <p> " That means they are $ 45 million ahead in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in this business to be competitive on the field . If I ca n't do that , I 'll get out . " <p> Bowlen says he wo n't move the team but might sell it to someone who would . <p> " The team is not moving , " Denver Mayor Wellington Webb says . " When you threaten a Westerner , you better put up or shut up . <p> " If you have a problem , ask for help . But if you threaten us , our response is , ' The hell with you . ' " <p> Those words have to sting a franchise that boasts 28 consecutive years of sold-out games , four AFC titles and just three losing seasons since 1977 . <p> Expanding market <p> The team 's success , however , has contributed to its woes . <p> Season tickets are family heirlooms that would only be sold under duress . Those 214 consecutive home sellouts mean that two generations of fans have n't been able to buy season tickets and know the team only from TV . <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockies and the National Hockey League 's Colorado Avalanche to capture the hearts , minds and pocketbooks of younger fans and newcomers . To a lesser extent , fans can get their local live sports fix from the NBA 's Nuggets , Major League Soccer 's Rapids and the women 's American Basketball League 's Xplosion . <p> " When I bought the team ( in 1984 ) , there was just the Nuggets and ourselves , " Bowlen says . " With the addition of hockey and baseball , the market 's been stretched thin . <p> " We have to market ourselves harder than ever because people have choices . What 's changed is that if you do n't have a winning record and a new stadium , you 're going to have big problems . " <p> The Rockies have both . The 5-year-old National League team made the playoffs in its third season . Coors Field is a retro-classic ballpark with as much action in the mezzanine as on the field . The team pulled in about $ 24 million last year from concessions and parking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightclub district , just a short walk from Denver 's bustling downtown . <p> The Avalanche now play in McNichols Arena , next door to tattered Mile High and separated from downtown by eight lanes of Interstate 25 . <p> They won the Stanley Cup in 1996 , the team 's first season in Denver . That also was the city 's first major pro championship  --  the Broncos have lost four Super Bowls . <p> In the 1996-97 season , the Avalanche had the best record in the NHL and fell to eventual champion Detroit in the Stanley Cup semifinals . Because of a lease deal similar to the Broncos ' , they lost money . <p> In three years , the Avalanche and Nuggets will move from McNichols to the new Pepsi Center , across the interstate , near downtown and the three-college Auraria Campus . <p> Mile High Stadium was built in layers over the years . The original facility was constructed in 1948 and was called Bears Stadium after the city 's Class AAA baseball team . It was expanded to 34,000 seats in 1959 when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought it up to 75,000 for the 1977 season and the addition of 60 luxury boxes in 1986 took it up to present capacity of 76,273 . <p> As with most stadiums of its era , Mile High is more of a seating structure than an entertainment center . Fans queue up elbow to elbow in crowded concrete ramps to scarf down buffalo burgers and tacos . <p> Slap in the face <p> High above the field on the third deck , Mark and Leanne Zukas have a unique perspective : The couple from Pine Junction , Colo. , have season tickets for the Broncos , Avalanche and Rockies . The Broncos tickets have been in Leanne 's family since 1965 . <p> At the season opener , Mark 's face is painted blue and orange , something he does at every home game . <p> " The Avalanche are on a par with the Broncos , and everyone loves the Rockies , " Mark says . " It is important the Broncos get a new stadium . The city should do everything in its power to keep them here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about moving the team " is a slap in the face to longtime fans . It makes me angry . " <p> Mayor Webb says he , too , is a fan and attends many games . <p> " We support the team and applaud their victories , " he says . " Boosterism is appropriate , but it should not supersede business . This is not fun and games ; this is about spending millions of taxpayer dollars . " <p> For Bowlen and the Broncos , the millions at stake are beginning to add up . The team has proposed a deal where the city would cover the first $ 180 million for construction of a new stadium and the team would pick up the balance up to $ 80 million . <p> The Broncos got bad news Monday from City Attorney Dan Muse . The city 's chief negotiator said they 'll have to pony up an additional $ 60 million to $ 100 million to buy out the 20 years on Mile High 's lease and pay for the demolition , land and infrastructure . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metro area will be asked to approve a 0.01% sales-tax increase to pay the bill . That vote is expected next year . <p> Webb says the length of the current lease puts the Broncos in a weak bargaining position . He points out that when Browns owner Art Modell moved his team to Baltimore in 1996 , the NFL negotiated a settlement that gave Cleveland $ 48 million as compensation for the last year of the Browns ' stadium lease , plus the team name , colors and the promise of an expansion or existing team by 1999 . <p> The prospect of that scenario coming to Denver has sent a chill through the city . <p> " There 's a curse on the Broncos , " observes ticket-less fan Juan Martinez . " They get to win , but they can never go all the way . That 's the same with the new stadium . There 's always this feeling that they 're going to mess up , and that just breaks your heart . " <p> And as NFL Players Association executive director Gene Upshaw told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine that there would not be football in Denver . But I also said that about Cleveland . "
