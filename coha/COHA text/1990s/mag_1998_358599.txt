It 's a chilly night on Chicago 's Near North Side , and Bill Tomes is sitting comfortably in the warm interior of his silver Buick Park Avenue . Playing softly on the stereo is his favorite cassette , Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic 's Saint-Saens . For a moment , at least , the melody seems to have transported him away from this place he calls the " killing field , " an eerily barren patch of inner-city landscape that glows starkly in his headlights . <P> Tomes  --  or " Brother Bill , " as he has come to be known  --  has seen some of his best friends murdered on this field . The victims are not pals from his college days at Notre Dame or buddies from the well-to-do Evanston neighborhood where he grew up . They are mostly the hardened souls of the Gangster Disciples , their Vice Lord rivals and a tally of cross-fire casualties who lived in the wretched Cabrini-Green housing projects just a mile or so from Chicago 's gleaming downtown . <P> There is Charles Dorsey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckles , 21 ; Derrell Ellis , 16 ; Laquanda Edwards , 15 ; Laketa Crosby Rodgers , 9 ; and Dantrell Davis , the youngest , shot to death at 7 . Tucked away at home , Brother Bill has a black leather attache case packed with more than 100 obituaries of these , the young and the dead , now gone from his flock . <P> Fifteen years ago , an extraordinary epiphany drew William Wylie Tomes Jr . to a series of Chicago housing projects , including Cabrini-Green . Since then , as a Roman Catholic lay worker , he has embraced the people of the projects as if they were family and tried to steer them off the path to an early grave . As a consequence , Brother Bill is perhaps the only outsider who can walk freely through the 15 buildings that make up Cabrini-Green or penetrate the paranoid , often vicious circle the gangsters have built around themselves . <P> " What up , Brother Bill ! " a voice booms outside the car . Brother Bill gets out of the car and hugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy says , his shoulders hunched in the cold as he awaits customers for the crack cocaine and heroin he is peddling . <P> " Naw , Dee , you da man , " Brother Bill belts out in his best street drawl . " Always will be . " <P> Everyone in Cabrini-Green , it seems , knows Brother Bill , 63 . He is a difficult man to overlook , his 5-ft. 11-in. , 220-lb. frame clad in a trademark flowing , sky-blue cassock made from hundreds of tattered denim patches . That robe has become an understood symbol of peace and humility in this place with precious little of either . Fifty-three times , by his count , he has waded into gunfire in order to stop it . Fifty-three times , the gunfire has stopped . And 53 times , he has emerged unscathed . <P> He talks trigger-itching assailants into putting away their guns and going home to their families . He sits beside wounded gangsters who hope to die and persuades them to live . And he insists that there is nothing special about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an extraordinary mission , " he says .
