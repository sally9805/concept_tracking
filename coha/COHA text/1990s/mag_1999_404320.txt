// RAY HOWLAND DEVOTED MUCH OF HIS LIFE TO BIKE SAFETY , WHICH MAKES HIS TRAGIC DEATH ALL THE MORE IRONIC HAD THEY MET ANY OTHER WAY , RAY HOWLAND AND BERT STOOTHOFF WOULD HAVE GOTTEN ALONG JUST FINE . THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS . BOTH WERE FAMILY MEN , DEVOTED TO THEIR CHILDREN , ACTIVE IN THEIR CHURCHES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES ; BOTH HAD BEEN VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS . THEY SHARED AN AFFECTION FOR MOUNT DORA , THE CENTRAL FLORIDA TOWN WHERE STOOTHOFF LIVED AND HOWLAND VISITED EVERY YEAR . It would n't have mattered that 35year-old Stoothoff was half Howland 's age ; the older man " loved people , " as his son put it . Heck , they even drove the same kind of car , a Chevy Blazer . As it happened , Stoothoff was in his Blazer , driving home from his Baptist church where he 'd been setting up for a function . It was 8 a.m. on October 18 , 1998 , and he was rushing home to shower and change into his church clothes before services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coasted down the off-ramp to state Route 46 , a two-laner . It was a beautiful sunny morning in Mount Dora , the last day of the Mount Dora bike fest , which draws 1,500 cyclists every fall for rides amidst the region 's rolling hills , woods , orange groves and lakes . At the bottom of the ramp , Stoothoff looked to his right and saw an approaching group of cyclists . He turned left in front of them , quickly  --  he did n't want the riders slowing him down-and ran straight into Howland , who was straddling his bike by the right side of the road , putting on sunscreen . Howland was also going to church that morning ; in fact , he 'd persuaded his friends Lou Satterlee and Diana Jackson to ride early with him , so he could get back in time to attend Mass before driving home to North Palm Beach with his wife , Edie . As usual , he 'd shot ahead of the group-you could n't out-ride 69year-young Ray Howland . A lean , powerfully built man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , and he loved to ride . But now he was waiting for his friends , on the edge of the shoulder , with one foot on the grass . He never saw Stoothoff 's Blazer coming . Jackson found him broken and bloody in a shallow swale beneath the 441 overpass . She got a faint pulse for a moment , but then it flickered and died . The police drove Jackson and Satterlee back to their campsite at the high school where Edie was packing their gear . Satterlee had to tell her : There had been an accident , and Ray was dead . " Are you sure ? " she asked , searching their sorrowful faces . Satterlee looked her in the eye . " Yes , Edie , I 'm sure . " In an instant Ray Howland went from bike-safety advocate to bike-safety statistic , his death a graphic reminder that nobody is safe " outside the protective shell of the automobile , " as Mount Dora lawyer William Herrman put it . It is sadly ironic that Howland was killed in Mount Dora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bike  --  friendly roads in the state , and not in the congested West Palm Beach area in South Florida where he normally rode . Ray Howland rode practically every day , averaging 600 to 700 miles a month . He kept a meticulous log in which he noted the day 's mileage , speed ( at least 15 mph , always ) , and temperature , plus heart rate , blood pressure and how many Motrins he 'd taken . He was 69 , after all , and one of his knees had already been replaced , but he still rode centuries and raced triathlons as easily as some younger men go to the movies . " He honestly thought he would live forever , " says Edie , " that he 'd always be here , riding his bike . " His favorite ride ran up the coast highway from North Palm Beach to Port Salerno for Saturday breakfast , about 20 miles each way . Satterlee and Jackson were regulars on the ride , and so was his friend Hubie Girard , a 65-year-old who rode many thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Ray and Hubie who schooled the younger newcomers in riding technique and paceline etiquette . There was even a bike lane part of the way , between Juno Beach and Jupiter . As a member of a countywide bicycle/pedestrian advisory committee , Howland had helped unlock federal ISTEA ( Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act ) money to get it built . But most of the trip was on Route AIA , which was as scary as it was scenic . He did n't talk much on the way , preferring to save the chitchat for breakfast . But if anyone strayed too far into the traffic lanes , Howland would chastise them . He knew the dangers of riding on the roads . He 'd been hit and badly injured in ' 87 while riding up U.S. 1 , by a driver who claimed not to have seen him . The crash left Howland with cracked ribs , a shattered ankle and acres of road rash . No charges were filed against the motorist , a kid in his 20s , and Howland was angry about that for awhile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crash had a silver lining , he figured , because it gave him a reason to replace his old Peugeot with a new Cannondale , which he kept in the living room of his one-bedroom apartment . He was president of the 300-member West Palm Beach Cycling Club-the sort of job that is available to anyone willing to take it on . Ray always volunteered for those jobs ; for a dozen years , he 'd been town manager of North Palm Beach . Under him , the cycling club had donated $1,000 to the Florida Bicycling Association , a crucial donation at a time when the club was reorganizing . He also served on the Palm Beach County bike/pedestrian committee , and used his local influence as a former town manager , to help make the area friendly for cycling-as much as possible in car  --  clogged South Florida . " He knew his way around politics , " says Frank Bostwick , who replaced Howland as president of the West Palm Beach club . " He knew how to get things done quietly and efficiently . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips , a senior planner for the Palm Beach County Metropolitan Planning Organization , " but when he said something , you listened , because he was right . " And in death , he became Exhibit A for the argument that in the contest between bicyclist and automobile , the automobile always wins . Here was the president of South Florida 's largest bike club , killed at the state 's biggest bike festival-an event where riders expect to feel relatively safe . But the irony and the tragedy did n't start with Howland . Two years ago , on the day after Christmas ' 96 , a driver plowed into a paceline of six riders , killing two of them , including 31-year-old Margaret Raynal , who was the state 's bicycle safety trainer . Last summer , a triathlete was mowed down while riding on the shoulder of Route 27 , not far from Mount Dora . No charges were filed in either case ; at press time , no charges had been filed against StoothofF either , despite strong evidence of reckless driving on his part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at fault . The Mount Dora Topic declared that " fastmoving , inattentive cyclists unfamiliar with our hilly , twisting and narrow roads are unwanted and dangerous road hazards for our drivers . " And furthermore : " Cyclists feeling the need to use roads designed for motor vehicles , thereby endangering themselves and drivers , must be made liable for accidents they are either involved in or cause . However clumsily the editorials reflected motorists ' frustrations in Mount Dora at riders ' erratic behavior and their tendency to ride three or four abreast on roads with little or no shoulder , causing traffic to stack up behind them . The Mount Dora police department has vowed to strictly enforce traffic laws during next year 's Bike Fest , a notion that Fest organizers support . But Howland could hardly be said to have caused his accident : He was standing off the side of the road , on the grass . In fact , at the time of his death , he was more pedestrian than cyclist . " It could have been anybody , " says lawyer Herrman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child walking to school , or even a police officer writing a ticket . " One morning in January , three months after Ray Howland died , I drove a rental car down the off-ramp from U.S. 441 , stopped at the stop sign and swung left on Route 46 , just as Stoothoff had . Rounding the corner , I relaxed my grip on the wheel momentarily , as though I were changing a CD or otherwise distracted . The car briefly veered onto the shoulder , aiming directly at the spot where Howland stood-but I was able to correct its course well before the spray-painted " PO.I. " that still marked the point of impact on the road . According to the police crash report , Stoothoff turned the corner and swung wide along the edge of the shoulder where he struck Howland . But photographs taken the next day show tire tracks veering off the road altogether and onto the grass , indicating that Stoothoff may have lost control of his vehicle at high speed . It was difficult to see how Stoothoff , who drove through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did-unless he ran the stop sign or floored the gas pedal . One witness , cyclist John Renna , says Stoothoff did , in fact , stop at the stop sign . As of late January , the State 's Attorney for Lake County had not decided whether to file charges against Stoothoff . ( Contacted at his home , Stoothoff declined to answer questions . ) Ray Howland devoted much of his life to bicycle safety , but it was his tragic death , at the hands of a careless driver , that galvanized his fellow riders . A hundred and fifty people showed up for a memorial ride in December . The Florida Bicycle Association urged its members to write letters to Mount Dora officials , threatening to boycott the Bike Fest next year if no action is taken . The Bike Fest is the biggest weekend for Mount Dora businesses , according to the local Chamber of Commerce . This made local police uncomfortable : If they filed charges against Stoothoff , one police lieutenant said , it would look like they were bending to outside pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would look as if they were protecting one of their own ; as a volunteer firefighter in a town of 9,000 people , Stoothoff knew the officers who investigated his accident . The police and fire departments are housed in the same building . Yet the Howland family has expressed no desire for vengeance . " I do n't think my father would have wanted him to suffer any more than he already has , " says Mike Howland , Ray 's 44-year-old son . That sentiment is not shared by other Florida cyclists , some of whom want to see an example made of Stoothoff . I rode with a Mount Dora rider who told me , " You have to watch your ass on these roads . I 'm tired of it . I want everybody to know about this accident . " Florida has the worst per-million fatality rate for cyclists of any state in the country , but injuries-perhaps a better measure of road safety-are on the decline , thanks to growing awareness by drivers and better conditions for bicyclists . Ten years ago , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; now it has 130 miles . A " Share the Road " license plate is in the pipeline , and new ( and rebuilt ) roads are being designed with broader shoulders and , in some cases , bike lanes . Ray Howland did n't cause these changes , of course , but by getting involved as deeply as he could-sitting through years ' worth of bicycle/pedestrian advisory committee meetings , for example-he did his small part , in his own quiet way .
