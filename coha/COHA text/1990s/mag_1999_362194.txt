The Kansas Board of Education voted 6 to 4 to remove evolution , and the Big Bang theory as well , from the state 's science curriculum . In so doing , the board transported its jurisdiction to a never-never land where a Dorothy of the new millennium might exclaim , " They still call it Kansas , but I do n't think we 're in the real world anymore . " The new standards do not forbid the teaching of evolution , but the subject will no longer be included in statewide tests for evaluating students  --  a virtual guarantee , given the realities of education , that this central concept of biology will be diluted or eliminated , thus reducing courses to something like chemistry without the periodic table , or American history without Lincoln . <P> The Kansas skirmish marks the latest episode of a long struggle by religious Fundamentalists and their allies to restrict or eliminate the teaching of evolution in public schools  --  a misguided effort that our courts have quashed at each stage , and that saddens both scientists and most theologians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any threat to religion  --  for these two great tools of human understanding operate in complementary ( not contrary ) fashion in their totally separate realms : science as an inquiry about the factual state of the natural world , religion as a search for spiritual meaning and ethical values . <P> In the early 1920s , several states simply forbade the teaching of evolution outright , opening an epoch that inspired the infamous 1925 Scopes trial ( leading to the conviction of a Tennessee high school teacher ) and that ended only in 1968 , when the Supreme Court declared such laws unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds . In a second round in the late 1970s , Arkansas and Louisiana required that if evolution be taught , equal time must be given to Genesis literalism , masquerading as oxymoronic " creation science . " The Supreme Court likewise rejected those laws in 1987 . <P> The Kansas decision represents creationism 's first  --  and surely temporary  --  success with a third strategy for subverting a constitutional imperative : that by simply deleting , but not formally banning , evolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative , " their narrowly partisan religious motivations might not derail their goals . <P> Given this protracted struggle , Americans of goodwill might be excused for supposing that some genuine scientific or philosophical dispute motivates this issue : Is evolution speculative and ill founded ? Does evolution threaten our ethical values or our sense of life 's meaning ? As a paleontologist by training , and with abiding respect for religious traditions , I would raise three points to alleviate these worries : <P> First , no other Western nation has endured any similar movement , with any political clout , against evolution  --  a subject taught as fundamental , and without dispute , in all other countries that share our major sociocultural traditions . <P> Second , evolution is as well documented as any phenomenon in science , as strongly as the earth 's revolution around the sun rather than vice versa . In this sense , we can call evolution a " fact . " ( Science does not deal in certainty , so " fact " can only mean a proposition affirmed to such a high degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assent. )
