<p> FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS 20-year career , the celebrated British comic Rowan Atkinson has a shot at American stardom . He is underwhelmed . <p> " I 'm not very ambitious in the film world , " he said , " which is probably indicated by the fact that I 've done so little and the only bits I 've done have been very small parts . " <p> Mr. Atkinson is best known to American audiences for one of those small parts , the befuddled vicar who mangles the solemn marriage vows in the 1994 film " Four Weddings and a Funeral . " ( He also provided the impeccably fussy voice for Zazu , the hornbill courtier in " The Lion King . " ) It is as Mr. Bean , his signature television character , that Mr. Atkinson has finally been placed at the center of a film . <p> The television series " Mr. Bean , " which features a contemporary sort of silent-movie clown who blunders through everyday escapades with mime and slapstick , had its premiere in Britain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Myanmar , including something of a following in the United States through PBS broadcasts . The movie " Bean " has been released first overseas , where the character is better known , and has already earned $100 million for Polygram Filmed Entertainment in countries ranging from Australia to Brazil . It was shown on the first night of the New York Comedy Film Festival last week and will open in American theaters on Nov. 7 . <p> Shuffling stoop-shouldered into a meeting room at the Four Seasons Hotel in Manhattan recently , Mr. Atkinson certainly did not project the aura of a driven charismatic performer . Nor , sipping tea , did he convey any hint of the outrageous comedic personas that have made him a star in Britain and many other parts of the world . <p> Hardly an off-screen zany like Robin Williams or Jim Carrey , the 42-year-old Mr. Atkinson seems downright bookish . His television character Black Adder , lesser known than Mr. Bean and highly verbal , skewers everyone in sight with a contemptuous wit , but the man behind this ultimate antihero speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a wave of pure juvenile impulse , but the actor is deferential , somber . <p> " Quite a nasty piece of work , " Mr. Atkinson said of Mr. Bean . " Not the sort of person you 'd want to have dinner with . " <p> On television and on film , Mr. Bean utters only occasional words , in a barely intelligible croak . Although he is enough of a bedeviled loser to win sympathy , he is also a thoroughly self-involved creature . He cheats on college exams and runs other people 's cars off the road . He even taunts hospital patients encased in body casts . <p> Only a performer as adept as Mr. Atkinson is with facial agility and loose-limbed body language could make the incorrigible Mr. Bean a pleasure to watch . And what Mr. Atkinson lacks in blind Hollywood ambition , he compensates for with what has been widely recognized as an unusual talent at both physical and verbal humor . Even though his exposure in the United States has been limited , he was still ranked No. 19 in Entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> TALENT , THOUGH , DOES not always assure success when comedy is exported across the Atlantic . The British stage comedies of Alan Ayckbourn have n't found much of an audience in the United States , and Neil Simon 's plays have encountered a lukewarm reception in Britain . Mr. Atkinson himself ran aground in America when his 1986 stage revue , " Rowan Atkinson at the Atkinson , " had only a short stay on Broadway . <p> Mr. Atkinson believes that " Bean " has a better chance of bounding across the trans-Atlantic hurdle . The character 's nonverbal nature is one factor . " There is always that age-old thing about England and America being divided by a common language , " he said . " You think that because we speak English and you speak English that you 're bound to understand and like everything that we do . And of course you do n't . " <p> Mr. Bean 's appeal to both children and adults may be another asset . " Mr. Bean 's core audience of enthusiasts is probably children because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But at the same time adults find him fairly absurd as well . It 's almost a sort of self-congratulation on the part of adults  --  that they thankfully have grown out of that awful kind of behavior of which Mr. Bean is capable , and they think , ' Thank God I 'm not like that anymore . ' " <p> His other , intensely verbal comedies are more attuned to British sensibilities , a set of concerns and attitudes that for Mr. Atkinson was cultivated by his distinctly English upbringing . As his reserved manner suggests , the comedian comes from a staid middle-class family . He characterized his fellow Atkinsons as " decidedly not " funny . The greatest fuel for his comedic impulses may have been his tony public-school education . " All the sort of absurdities and hypocrisies and almost Dickensian characters that you come across in that environment , I think , provided great inspiration , " he said . <p> THIS INSPIRATION IS BEST seen in a sketch from Mr. Atkinson 's 1986 stage revue in which he plays a headmaster who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educator blandly announces that the man 's son has been beaten to death for taking out a book without a library card . The headmaster is considerably put out by the whole thing . Referring to the boy , he says , " Quite frankly , Mr. Perkins , if he was n't dead , I 'd have him expelled . " <p> Mr. Atkinson 's education culminated with a degree from Oxford University in , of all things , electrical engineering . He also did some theatrical comedy at Oxford , and after college he moved on to stage revues and , eventually , television . " Black Adder " was Mr. Atkinson 's first show to find its way to America , via A &E; and PBS . That show ravages British history , from the days of Richard III to World War I. Through it all , various Black Adder descendants ( all played by Mr. Atkinson ) stab backs in their quest for undeserved power and wealth . <p> The transition from television to film has been a slow one . Even after his performance in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not besieged with film offers . At least not for roles he would have wanted . " Hollywood is quite famous for not knowing what to do with people , " he said . " So even if you 're good , to translate that into a performance in another film is unlikely , because traditionally , as you know , English actors play the butlers or psychopaths . " <p> Polygram decided to back " Bean " because of the character 's built-in international appeal . Markets outside the United States have been the initial focus , but Polygram seems determined to make inroads with Americans . " Our biggest challenge with this movie is to Beanify America , " said Russell Schwartz , president of Gramercy , the American subsidiary of Polygram that is releasing the film here . " Bean 's an odd character ; he does n't have traditional one-liners that you can cut a trailer out of . He 's a little more subtle . " <p> To acclimate Americans to Bean 's peculiarities , Gramercy orchestrated a five-month campaign that has included brief showings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Mr. Bean " episodes on home video . <p> Making Mr. Bean , essentially a sketch character , into the protagonist for a feature-length film required some significant changes . In the film , Mr. Bean is transported to Los Angeles and is passed off as a noted art historian , a story that required Mr. Atkinson to talk a bit more than he does in the television series . Also , Mr. Bean 's selfishness is tempered somewhat , although he is not likely to be mistaken for a Capra esque mensch . <p> As for overcoming American resistance to British humor , some think that this obstacle may be overstated . Jonathan Lynn , the British director who made " Nuns on the Run " in his native country as well as the hit " My Cousin Vinny " in the United States , believes that a good comedy should be able to find an audience on either side of the Atlantic , provided that expectations are realistic . " Not every comedy aims at the same mass audience , " Mr. Lynn said . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woody Allen movie , you do n't expect that it 's going to do $300 million at the box office , but interestingly enough Woody Allen plays , I believe , as well in Britain and France as it does in America . " <p> Even if " Bean " turns out to be a success here , Mr. Atkinson is ambivalent on the prospect of sequels . " I 'm not yet keen on the idea of starting a kind of Pink Panther tradition of movies , where you 're just going to make one every two years for the rest of your life , " he said . <p> One reason for this lack of enthusiasm for film is his fondness for television . " I 've always enjoyed studio audiences , and I enjoy the speed of the process , " Mr. Atkinson said . " In film you do have resources and the time to realize a very finely tuned product , but I think sometimes the gloss that film has is not much more than gloss . In terms of character performance , which is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as likely for it to be good on television . "
