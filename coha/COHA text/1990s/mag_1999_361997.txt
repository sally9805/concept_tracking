The most celebrated figures in jazz tend to play one of a limited set of instruments : piano , trumpet , saxophone , a few others . The most celebrated instrumentalists in jazz also tend to be men , with women , for the most part , relegated to finding fame as vocalists . Regina Carter breaks the rules : she 's a female instrumentalist , not a singer , and she plays the violin , which , although it has a long history in jazz , is not considered by all fans to be a core jazz instrument . However , for Carter , her violin is her voice  --  soaring , sighing , demanding , convincing . Carter 's previous album , Something for Grace , was a smooth-jazz , easy-listening affair . Her newest release , Rhythms of the Heart ( Verve ) , swings harder , aims higher and cuts deeper . <P> The Detroit-born Carter , who studied classical music as a child but switched to jazz in high school , has played backup for some of the top performers in jazz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spotlight . Her sound has echoes of the jazz-violin greats of the past : the melodic instincts of Stephane Grappelli , the sweet swing of Stuff Smith . <P> On Rhythms of the Heart , Carter creates music that is wonderfully listenable , probingly intelligent and , at times , breathtakingly daring . On one track , Papa Was a Rollin ' Stone , she cheekily combines classic soul and traditional jazz , with Cassandra Wilson supplying the vocals . It 's the high point of a CD filled with peaks : voice and violin , darting and duetting , taking the listener into the future of jazz . <P>  --  C.J.F.
