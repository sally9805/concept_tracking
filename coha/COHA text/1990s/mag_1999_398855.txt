Section : Methods and Materials <p> Painting on material that is n't commonly associated with painting is a concept that has intrigued artists for centuries . Paul Gauguin , captivated by burlap , used it for many of his oil paintings ; countless 18th-century American folk artists painted on the sleek surface of glass ; and as far back as the 1600s , copper was prized by various European painters . Giovanni Francesco Barbieri ( 1591-1666 ) , known as Guercino , completed around 12 paintings on copper . One , depicting two angels weeping over the dead Christ , done around 1617 , is said to have so impressed the artist with its jewellike quality that he kept it at his bedside until he died . <p> Contemporary artists who want a surface with a rough texture often look to burlap , a coarse , loosely woven yarn spun from jute . Jimmy Wright of New York City , who enjoys creating heavy textures with paint , usually on canvas or linen , decided to give burlap a try after receiving a recommendation from his art-materials supplier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klee , had worked on burlap , I was familiar with its possibilities , " he explains . <p> For his painting Blue Vase/Sunflower , Wright first primed the stretched burlap with warm rabbitskin glue , letting it soak through the fibers to protect the burlap from the oils of the paint . Once that was dry , he then applied several coats of gesso to fill in the openings in the weave . <p> Working in the same manner as if he were using cotton duck canvas , Wright created the first version of the painting in oils ( Figure 1 ) . Later , dissatisfied with the painting , Wright decided to rework it , using the red background as the underpainting and glazing over it with a mixture of paint , a bit of liquid paint medium , and some soft wax medium , which made the paint appear somewhat translucent . " Burlap allowed me to maintain a consistency of paint thickness without losing texture , " he explains . <p> Another strong and lasting substitute for canvas is polyester . When stretched and gessoed , polyester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oils . Not only can it be purchased effortlessly by the yard at a fabric store , but because it 's a form of plastic , polyester is not as susceptible to the rotting effects of oils , or to the expanding and shrinking problems that plague old canvases . <p> For artists who prefer rigid supports , I recommend experimenting with gessoed wooden panels . Made from cedar , walnut , oak , or a variety of tropical hardwoods , these panels are easy to find and are often sold with strips of wood glued to the back to prevent warping . Avoid such softwood panels as pine , however , because these woods emit resins that could ruin the paint . <p> A popular modern surface that possesses qualities similar to those of wood panels , Masonite is a synthetic pressed board composed of sawdust and glue . Precut untempered Masonite panels can be found in art-supply stores , or 4 " - x- 8 " sheets of either l/4- or 1/8-inch thick can be purchased at a lumberyard . Depending on where the Masonite is purchased , the sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While both sides of Masonite may be used for painting , most artists prefer to use the smooth side , which should be prepared with a couple of coats of gesso . To prevent the panel from warping , apply two 4-inch lines of gesso in the shape of an X on the reverse side of the Masonite while the smooth side is still wet with gesso . Sanding the front of the panel with a fine sandpaper will make it a sleek ground . Oil paints , in particular , when thinned with oil or varnish , tend to glide freely and retain an uncommon shine on Masonite that has been prepared in this manner . Plywood and chipboard ( a heavy industrial material sometimes called pressboard ) , which can also be found at a lumberyard , act as strong painting supports as long as they are adequately primed with two or three coats of gesso . Look for weather and boil proof ( WBP ) plywood , which is the highest quality . <p> Using glass as her surface , Karin E. Sanborn of Brockton , Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she learned from her mother , a longtime restorer of such works . In reverse painting , the image is painted on one side of the glass but viewed from the other . Sanborn finds this method appealing because the slickness of the glass affords her " a certain lack of control , " as she says . " Once I have applied the paint , I ca n't correct mistakes . " She buys a standard window glass from a local glass store and requests that the glass be seamed  --  a process of grinding the edges of the glass  --  to avoid cutting herself . For works under 12 square inches , she uses 1/16-inch glass , and for larger works she uses 1/8 inch . <p> Cleaning the glass is the first step , says Sanborn . She washes it with a nonabrasive household cleanser and then thoroughly rinses it under running water . Afterward , to remove any excess cleanser , she goes over the surface with a paper towel dampened with water and white vinegar . <p> When Sanborn paints Oh glass , she works " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I have to look through the other side of the glass to view the finished image , " as she explains . Therefore , she begins by painting the details , such as the fine lines or highlights . Once this layer dries , she then builds up the background colors one layer at a rime , letting each layer dry thoroughly before she applies the next . The artist typically builds up to 10 layers this way . Employing soft oil painting brushes , she uses oils thinned with a high-quality varnish , which contributes to the luminous appearance of her works . Once finished , she coats the image with a final layer of varnish . <p> Copper , aluminum , iron , stainless steel , and zinc are also excellent supports . Jan Brueghel the Elder ( 15681625 ) earned a reputation as the " Velvet Brueghel " for his smoothly finished landscapes painted on copper . Metals have become a favorite for many contemporary artists because they are an excellent surface on which to render details . However , with any metal , it 's important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol , or a degreasing fluid , and then prime it so the paint wo n't flake off . <p> Rebecca Morales from Santa Ana , California , paints what she calls " carpets of land " on aluminum panels . " I prefer aluminum because it 's a very smooth surface , " she asserts , " which affords me a great deal of control . I do n't have to give up anything to the surface , as I might with a canvas or wood in which the weave or grain might affect the mark . " <p> She prefers the standard-grade aluminum she finds at metal fabrication manufacturers , because " although it 's fairly light , it is thick enough that it wo n't bend . Preparing the aluminum for painting is a process that requires special attention , " Morales warns . " Because metal oxidizes , it must be properly primed . If the panel is n't sealed from the paint properly , the paint wo n't stick to it when the aluminum begins to oxidize . " Once she has cleaned the aluminum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is dry , she applies a coat of all-purpose sandable primer . Morales recommends using the highest grades of both primers . <p> Her painting process typically involves spending up to four days in the desert gathering reference material , snapping photos , taking color notes , and painting preliminary pieces . She then returns to her studio and , referring to these reminders of the location , builds up areas with thick pieces of paint and glazes , without adhering to a strict system . <p> Aluminum panels are fragile , warns the artist , so she takes great care when moving them so the edges do n't dent , setting them on packing blankets or foam In addition , she wears white cotton gloves when moving them to protect the borders from the oil on her skin . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Left : Evening Still Life , by Jimmy Wright , 1992 , oil on burlap , 96 x 72 .
