He knew nothing about photography other than he liked a good picture as much as the next guy . Once in a while he 'd see one so startling , original , or provocative that it would stop him and make him gape or shake his head in wonder at the moment or piece of the world caught there . But beyond that he had given it little thought , That 's what was great about life : some people knew how to take pictures , others build chimneys or train poodles . Beizer believed in life . He was always grateful it had allowed him to walk in its parade . At times he was almost dangerously good natured . Friends and acquaintances were suspicious . Where did he get off being so happy ? What secret did he know he was n't telling ? There was a story going around that when Beizer discovered a letter his girlfriend was writing to a new secret lover , he offered to buy her a ticket to this man so she could go visit and find out what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy  --  with or without him . <p> But now things would change ! God or whoever had decided to give Norman Beizer a taste of the whip via this blindness . Friends were all sure he would change for the worse ; start ranting and shrinking into self-pity and end up like the rest of them  --  tight-lipped , expert shruggers , looking for the answer in tomorrow . <p> Instead he bought this camera . A real beauty too  --  a Cyclops 12 . Since he did n't know anything about the art , he went into the store an admitted idiot . That 's what he told the salesman . " Look , I do n't know about this stuff , but I want the best camera you have for absolute idiots . Something I can point and shoot and know it 's doing all the work . " The salesman liked his attitude , so instead of offering a Hiram Quagola or a Vaslov Cyncrometer , the kinds of cameras used by strict Germans to do black-and-white studies of celebrities ' noses , he put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . it 'll take you an hour to get the hang of it and then you 're on your way . " Beizer did something strange . He picked the camera up and , holding it against his chest , said , " Are you telling me the truth ? " <p> When was the last time a stranger asked you that question ? The salesman was flabbergasted . His job was lies and false zeal , fakes and passes behind his back . He had told the truth , but this customer wanted him to say it out loud , too . <p> " It 's the best for what you want . Try it a couple of days and if you do n't like it , bring it back and we 'll find you something else . " <p> The problem with the Cyclops was it was exactly what Beizer had asked for . It took an hour to read and understand the instructions . By the next morning , he had shot his first roll of film and had it developed . The pictures were as precisely focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held gotten what he paid for , but a moment after experiencing the picture he forgot it . The first of many revelations came to him . How many thousands and millions of times had certain things been photographed since the advent of the camera ? How many times had people aimed at their pets , the Eiffel Tower , the family at the table ? <p> Walking around the house one day trying to think of interesting and artistic things to photograph , he got down on his knees in the bathroom and took a picture of his toothbrush u through the glass shelf it rested on . That was pretty clever , but when he saw it developed , he frowned and knew at least a few hundred thousand people had probably had the same idea in one way or the other . Out there in the large world were drawers full of photos of toothbrushes shot " artily . " Worse , other people had had to take the time to fix their shutters and set the speeds because cameras had never been so sophisticated as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've got your toothbrush . But back whenever , one had to think , adjust and figure out how they 'd get that shot . There was process and careful thought involved . <p> While this played across his mind , he heard shouts through the open window and realized kids were having fun in the park across the street . Their calls were wild and screechy and he thought , If I were going deaf , how could I preserve those great sounds so that in my silence I could somehow remember them exactly and know them again ? We 're all aware that in the end the only thing left is our memories , but how do you preserve them when one part of you decides to die before the rest ? He realized he had bought this camera so he could go around seeing the world he knew for the last time and in so doing , perhaps teach his memory to remember . But that would n't work if he had a mindless genius machine that did exactly what he told it to but gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those exercise machines with electrodes you hook up to your body , then lie down and rest while electricity makes you thin and muscular . <p> He went back to the store . When the salesman saw him again he was almost afraid . Beizer decided to tell the man everything . About the blindness , about his need to find a camera that would not only do what he told it , but teach him how to see and remember as well . <p> As he walked to the counter , the thought came that whatever machine he left with this time , he would use a week to learn its principles , then allow himself to take only ten pictures before he put it down forever . The doctor said he had about three months before the disease marched across his vision dragging a black curtain behind it and then that would be the end . In the ninety days he had left , he would try to learn and consider and achieve all in one . Ten pictures . Ninety days to take ten pictures which , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty eyes with what he had lost . <p> The salesman heard him out and immediately suggested he go to a store specializing in books of great photography . " First look at books on Stieglitz and Strand . The guys in the Bauhaus School . They were the masters . That 's the best way to start . If you wanted to learn how to paint , you 'd go to a museum and look at da Vinci . " " It wo n't help . I 'll look and maybe see some great stuff , but that wo n't help me remember . I do n't even want to remember what they ... " Beizer held his hands up to the sides of his head as if showing the other how little space he had to fill there . " I do n't want to learn how to paint or take pictures . I want to remember my sights , not theirs . And I do n't have much time left . " <p> The salesman shrugged . " Then I do n't know what to tell you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a child 's camera . The simplest thing in the world , which means you 'll have to do all the work . When you want to take a picture , the lighting will have to be perfect , the focus , everything will have to be there because the camera wo n't do anything for you but click ; just the opposite of the Cyclops which does everything . The other way is to buy a Hasselblad or a Leica , which are the tops . But it takes years and thousands of pictures to figure out how to use them . I do n't know what to tell you . Can I think about it some more ? " Beizer left the store empty handed . But for the time being perhaps that was best ; having the right camera meant he 'd have to begin to start deciding . In this interim without one , he could go around looking at the world , trying to choose . <p> A few blocks from home , a man sat on the street with a hat turned over on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am blind and heartbroken and have no work . Please be kind and help me . " There were a few brown coins in the hat . " Are you really blind ? " <p> The beggar raised his head slowly and smiled . He was used to abuse . Some people taunted him . Now and then they 'd ask stupid questions but then give him money if they liked or pitied his response . Before he had a chance to answer , whoever stood above said , " Tell me what you miss most about not seeing and I 'll give you ten dollars . " <p> " Fried chicken . Can I have my ten dollars , please . " <p> Beizer was stunned but went for his wallet . " I do n't understand . " He handed over the money . <p> The blind man brought the bill to his nose and sniffed it . It was money , he was sure of that . Maybe even ten bucks . Why not ? The world was full of lunatics . Why not this one ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  smell , taste , and sight . You got ta see that gray going out your mouth and up in the air to really enjoy a cig . I stopped smoking about a month after I went blind . I know guys who ca n't see but keep doing it , but it 's a waste of time , you ask me . Same thing 's true with fried chicken . Taste it , smell , do all that , but seeing it 's most important . The way that gold skin cracks when you pull it apart , the smoke coming up from the pink meat underneath if it 's just fresh , then the shiny oil on you fingertips after you 're finished .... Do n't get me wrong , I still eat it , but it is n't the same . You got ta see to really eat it . " <p> Beizer gave him another ten dollars , and went right home to write that line down : " You got ta see to really eat it . " A week later , he found another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The celebrated painter Gainsborough got as much pleasure from seeing violins as from hearing them . " <p> Somewhere in the land where those two ideas lived was what he sought and Beizer knew it . <p> The girlfriend called , having returned from the romantic trip he had paid for . " It did n't work . Know what he did , among other things ? Sent these incredible love poems I thought he 'd written specially for me . Turns out he only copied them out of an anthology he kept from college . <p> " I 'm sorry I have n't called . What have you been doing ? " <p> " Going blind . " <p> " 0h my God ! " <p> They spoke a long while before she said gently , " Honey , you ca n't do photography when you 're blind . " <p> " Actually you can ; I heard there 's a whole bunch of blind people taking wonderful pictures . But that 's not what I 'm after . I do n't want to do photographs  --  I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . " After hanging up , he thought over what she 'd said about this man trying to pass off other people 's poetry for his own . Other people 's deepest-felt emotions . It was a clever way to trick a heart but what did it say about the man ? Beizer turned a few facts here and there and saw himself showing someone a famous picture he had not taken and saying , " This is one of my ten . This will comfort me when I can no longer see . " <p> That night he woke up and padded slowly across the dark to the toilet . Relieving himself , he realized this was what it would be like when he was old . Getting up , probably nightly , to go to the bathroom because one 's plumbing begins to weaken as we grow older . A familiar sound from when he went to visit his parents  --  the toilet next to their bedroom flushing in the wee hours of the morning . The wee hours . That made him smile . A good title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He should give it to the poem stealer .... Sleepily finishing his business , Beizer once again had the feeling of some invisible connection here . Finding it would help him overcome the problem of the pictures he wanted to take . <p> In bed again quickly slipping back into sleep , he thought poems are as personal as fingerprints . Steal one and you instantly give your own identity , as if you were actually giving up the lines on your fingers or the features on you face . <p> The features on his face ! He started , sat up , very much awake . An old man peeing in the night . What would he , Norman Beizer , look like when he was seventy and holding his old cock in his hand ? He 'd never know . He could n't look at someone else 's pictures of that ! Too soon he 'd never know how the first deep lines on his face would change him , what white hair would do to his appearance . These are important details . <p> He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time would be wasted in his future . The seconds lost spent on useless fumbling for a wall switch or the string to pull a curtain across . To move a curtain was a much larger concern for the blind . First find the strings , figure out which is the correct one , pull it . A matter of seconds for a person with sight , for the blind it would take three , four , five times unfairness of that , all the time he 'd soon need to waste on what he did now with no trouble . But how much of Beizer would he lose when he could no longer see him in the mirror . Watch the progress of time and life across that most familiar geography ? He sensed in time he would be able to accept the loss and forced limits that were coming , but until now he had n't realized something so important  --  he would also lose large parts of himself . <p> The next morning he called up the offices of Vogue magazine and Paramount Pictures . After running the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the proper people who , in both cases , were surprisingly kind and helpful . He asked the woman at the fashion magazine who she thought was the greatest portrait photographer in the city . Without hesitation she said Jeremy Flynn and gave him the name of the photographer 's agent . At Paramount , the vice president in charge of something said the greatest makeup person in the world was so-and-so . Beizer carefully noted the names and addresses . He had expected more trouble finding these things out but perhaps since he had figured out his problem , the solution slicked into place like the gears of a car engaging . He called the photographer and the makeup person and made appointments to see both of them . They charged an obscene amount of money , but the best were always worth it , particularly in this case . <p> When he met them , he explained his situation with almost exactly the same words : He was fast going blind . Before that happened , he wanted to see what he would look like for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him get as close to that as possible . The visagist should make him up to look as convincingly sixty , seventy , eighty as possible . Knowing his family history of bad hearts dying somewhere in their seventies , Beizer assumed his would , too . So his face at seventy would be close enough to his final days to satisfy . <p> The photographer was fascinated by the idea . He recommended pictures done with no tricks  --  no special lighting or backgrounds . Just Beizer in a dark suit and a white shirt . That way , his face would take up the entire world . The eye would be forced to look at the face and nothing else . Yes ! That was exactly what he wanted . <p> At the end of their meeting , Flynn asked what good would the pictures be when Beizer could no longer see them . " Because I will have seen them . I 'll be able to put them in front of someone and say , ' Is that what I 'm like now ? Tell me the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " <p> " Points of reference . " <p> " Exactly ! Points of reference . " <p> " Will you remember what 's there ? Even after years of not having seen ? " " I do n't know . I have to try . " <p> The big day came and he had the astonishing experience of seeing himself age forty years in one afternoon . Like time-lapse photography , he saw brand-new wrinkles groove his face , making it into something foreign and funnily familiar at the same time . He saw his hair disappear , his eyes turn down , skin like bread dough hang from his chin and neck . If an experience can be funny and terrifying at the same time , this was it . Each time he was eager to see what the next decades would do to him , but when the makeup man said , " Okay have a look , " Beizer was hesitant . He kept saying , " You think that 's what I 'll really look like ? " But down deep he knew it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next forty years . When he was a boy , he was a terrible sneak when it came to Christmas presents . Every year he was driven to find where all of his gifts were hidden , so that weeks before the big day , he knew exactly what he was getting . This was the same thing . Now he knew what he would be " getting " as the years passed . <p> And one would think that seeing himself across the rest of this life like that would have had some kind of large effect on Beizer , but the only real emotion he felt at the end of the session was amusement . When they were finished , he told the other two this and both said the same thing  --  wait till you see the pictures . In real life a person wearing makeup looks ... like a person wearing makeup . Especially if it is thick and involved . But wait till Flynn 's photographs were ready . Then he 'd see a hell of a difference . Any great photographer knows how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing this man the rest of his life in pictures . He planned to use these as the nucleus of his next exhibition and thus would spend even more time than usual making them as perfect as he could . <p> The call came very late at night . Beizer had been watching television and eating a plum . He did n't know what he enjoyed more  --  looking at the TV or the fat purple plum with the guts of a sunrise . " Norman ? This is Jeremy Flynn . Am I disturbing you ? " <p> " Not at all . Have you finished the pictures ? " <p> Flynn 's voice was slow in coming and when it came , it sounded like he was testing every word before he let it walk across his tongue . " Well yes , yes 1 just tonight started to work on them . But there 's a ... well , I do n't know how to put it . This is a crazy question because I know it 's really late , but do you think you could come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ? I really want to see them , Jeremy , but ca n't we do it tomorrow ? " <p> " Yes we can . Of course we can , but Norman , I think you 'll want to see them now . I think you 'll want to see them very much now . " <p> " Why ? " <p> Flynn 's voice went up three notches to semihysterical . The other day in his studio he had been very calm and good natured . " Norman , can you please come ? I 'll pay for your taxi . Just , please . " <p> Concerned , Beizer put his plum down and nodded at the phone . " Okay , Jeremy , I 'll come . " <p> Flynn was standing in the doorway of his house when Beizer arrived . He looked bad . He looked at the other like he 'd arrived in the nick of time . <p> " Thank God you 're here . Come in . Come in . " <p> The moment they stepped into the house and he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was going to work on them the whole night , you see ? I was going to give the whole night over to seeing what we 'd done the other day . So I set everything up and did the first roll . Do you know anything about developing film ? " He had Beizer by the arm and was leading him quickly through the house . <p> " No , but I 'd like to learn . I do n't think I told you , but this whole thing started when  --  " <p> " It does n't matter . Listen to this . I did the developing . I always do my own . And then I  --  here we are , in here . Then I got down to the first prints . Do you want to sit down ? " <p> Flynn was acting and speaking so strangely , so rushed and strangled , like he 'd swallowed air and was trying to bring it back up again . <p> " No , Jeremy , I 'm fine . " <p> " Okay . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you , you know , looking fifty or sixty ? I had all these great ideas of how to work with the paper to get this special effect I 've been thinking about  --  but when I saw what was on the film , the film I took of you , I panicked . " <p> Beizer thought he was joking , but also knew instinctively that he was n't because of the scared seriousness of Flynn 's voice . " What do you mean you panicked ? Did I look so ugly ? " <p> " No , Norman , you did n't look like anything at all . You were n't in the pictures . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " Look for yourself . " Flynn opened a very large manila envelope and slowly slid out a glossy photograph . It was of a large wheel stuck in the sand of a desert landscape . <p> " That 's nice . What is it ? " <p> " It 's you , Norman . Look at this one . " Flynn slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlight slanting across an empty set of swings on a playground . Beizer tried to speak but the photographer would n't let him . He took out another picture , then another and another . All of them different , some strange , some beautiful , some nothing special . <p> When he was finished , he put his hands on his hips and looked at his subject suspiciously . " That is the roll of film I took of you , Norman . There was no mistake because I purposely left the film in the camera after I shot the other day . Those pictures are what the camera took of you . <p> " I hate to tell you , Jeremy , but I 'm not a wheel , or a swing . " <p> " I know that . I did n't ask you over here to play a joke on you . That 's what I have , Norman . This is no joke . Those are the pictures I took of you the other day . " <p> " How am I supposed to respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Flynn sat down . Then he stood up . " No , I do know . I have to say something else . I have to tell you , whether it helps or not . Maybe it 'll even scare you . When I was young and learning to develop pictures , I took a whole roll one time of a girl I knew who I had a crush on . Kelly Collier . That same day I went into the darkroom to do them because I was so eager to have them . While I was in there , she and her mother were killed in a car accident . Naturally I did n't know that , but none of the pictures came out with her image . They came out like these . " <p> " You mean swings and a wheel ? " <p> " No , but things like that . Objects . Things that had nothing to do with her . I 've never told anyone the story , but Norman , this is exactly the same thing that happened with Kelly . Exactly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took these pictures while you 're going blind , There 's got to be a connection . " <p> " You think it 's your fault ? " <p> " No , I think ... I think sometimes the camera is able to catch things as they 're about to happen . Or as they 're happening . Or ... " Flynn licked his lips . " I do n't know . It has something to do with change . Or something to do with  --  " <p> Beizer tried to speak when he heard the other 's confusion . Because he realized it did have to do with change . As he looked longer at the picture in front of him and listened to the other speak , he began to understand . What had happened was Flynn 's camera had photographed their souls  --  the dead girl 's and Beizer 's  --  as they were going through ... as they lived different things . A soul was able to try on different existences as if they were clothes in a wardrobe . Of course a soul knows what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally with the girl , it knew her body was about to die . And in his own case , it knew what it would be like blind . So even while living in them , their souls were going out looking , traveling , window shopping for what they would become next . That was what the camera had somehow managed to capture . This plain metal and plastic , chemicals and glass had all worked together to catch two souls experimenting or playing , or whatever the word was for living a while in their future . Or was it their past ? Maybe they 'd like to rest in the moonlight and be swung on by day . maybe they were only reliving what it was like to be wheels , useless and thus marvelous out in a desert . <p> How did he know this ? How could a plain , nice , dull man like Norman Beizer realize something so secret and profound ? Because as Flynn spoke , Beizer began to recognize the photographs laid in front of him . Whatever part of him had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal out in the moonlight , or the heat of sand all around him . He recognized and remembered the feelings , temperatures , sounds ... that were in each of the pictures . <p> What was even better , he knew that that was what he would remember when he went blind . It would be enough , more than enough , for the rest of one life . He did n't need a camera , or ten unforgettable pictures , or portraits of himself as an old man . With this new understanding , he would have the ongoing knowledge and memories of where his soul had been . Until he died , blind or not , he would share the feelings and adventures of the part of him that was universal and curious . The part that was traveling , experiencing , knowing hotel lives of things . Things like wheels , like swings . One more bustling soul out there looking for what to do next . <p>                    @
