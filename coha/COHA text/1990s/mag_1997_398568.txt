// Children 's faces exploding into giggling laughter . The shy smile of an old woman as we savored a cup of dark , rich coffee beside a smoldering cook fire . The triumphant wave of a young fisherman in a fragile canoe as he held up his catch . The owl-wise eyes of a bent old man tirelessly rowing his sampan . These are the images that endure from a cruise of Indonesia 's Riau Islands , an enchanting archipelago scattered across an azure sea barely one degree above the equator . The northern tip of the Riaus is only 11 miles across the Singapore Straits from one of the most glittering cities in the Far East . But , once you venture past the string of luxury resorts on the north coast of Batam and Bintan islands , you slide back a thousand years in time and meet a people whose gentleness is exceeded only by their hospitality . The couple that my wife , Anne , and I had to thank for this voyage into another age was Bob Livingston , chairman and chief executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife Mary . Bob and Mary took us on tours of the Grand Banks Yachts plants in both Singapore and Johor , Malaysia , and , business completed , they put us aboard their personal Grand Banks 46 Europa . They had even provided us with a knowledgeable motoryacht guide , Matthew Hardy , a young Englishman , who lived in the Riaus for three years and has written the only cruising guide to the area . " Tourists have been able to visit the resorts along the north coast of Batam and Bintan by way of ferries from Singapore for several years , " Matthew explained as we headed south across the Singapore Straits . " But as far as cruising yachtsmen are concerned , the Riaus are virgin territory . Until very recently , the only way you could cruise the islands on a private vessel was to secure a permit for a single visit . And that permit was available only in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta which is about a thousand miles from Singapore . Now , the Indonesian government has realized the islands ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Indonesian embassy in Singapore . The principal market the government hopes to attract is Singaporean boaters , but we are already seeing a small charter market beginning to develop to serve boaters from beyond Singapore . " On our tour of Singapore , Bob had taken Anne and me to the huge , modern Raffles Marina complex and Matthew had taken us by the expansive Sabana Cove Marina in Malaysia . Both were packed with yachts , so it was obvious there was no shortage of boaters in the area to take advantage of the more liberal permit provisions . I was just thankful Anne and I were able to visit the Riaus before the rush begins . By early afternoon , we reached our first stop at Nongsa Point , a Mediterranean-style condominium development on Batam with a pleasant marina . Clearance through Indonesian customs and immigration was uncomplicated , and we enjoyed dinner in the marina 's restaurant and an overnight stay at the dock before setting out . From Nongsa Point we took a long , looping swing around the reef Karang Galang which lies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Batam from neighboring Bintan . We then cut between Bintan and the outlying pulaus ( islands ) of Lobam , Terkulai and Penyengat . Along the way , we saw kampongs ( villages ) built on stilts out over the water . " The terrain is very rough and difficult to build on , it is hot , and there are always problems with mosquitos , " Matthew explained . " The people of the Riaus build their houses out over the water to get away from the mosquitos and take advantage of the cool breezes . " Photograph Photograph Photograph Photograph // As we glided by Penyengat Island , Matthew gave us a brief history lesson . " In 1511 , " he said , " when the Portuguese invaded Malacca in what is now Malaysia , the Sultan fled to Bintan . He resisted the Portuguese from here until he was defeated by an armada in 1526 . In the 1600s , the Portuguese were displaced by the Dutch , then in the 1800s the Dutch clashed with the British . Under a treaty signed in London in 1884 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straits of Singapore , and the Dutch would control the area south of the Straits which they continued to do until the end of World War II . In 1945 , here on the island of Penyengat , the Royal elite formed the Rusydiah Club which eventually ended Dutch rule and helped create the modern state of Indonesia . " Just beyond Penyengat lay the largest town in the area , Tanjung Pinang , whose teeming harbor was jammed with colorful fishing and cargo boats . After dawdling along the waterfront for half an hour or so , we ran up the Selat Dompak toward our planned night 's dockage at the Shangrila seafood restaurant . The strait was dotted with strange open-frame structures . " Those are kelongs , quite ingenious fish traps , which the people of the Riaus have been building for generations , " Matthew explained . A net is lowered several feet below the surface of the water and a kerosene lantern is hung over it . During the night , fish are attracted to the light and school above the net . Well before dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the nets , and scoop out the fish . " As we rounded the eastern tip of Dompak Island , the Shangrila Restaurant lay ahead of us . Its front was lined with what appeared to be fish pens . " That 's what they are , " Matthew said . " The owner , Mr. Ong , buys fish from the locals and sells them to restaurants in Singapore . He keeps his inventory alive in the pens until he has enough for a run to the city . " Toward sunset we went into the Shangrila 's open-air dining room for dinner , for which Mr. Ong 's pens yielded a cornucopia of seafood : Ringed around a massive platter of nasi goering ( fried rice ) were plates piled high with gong gong ( a steamed shellfish ) , mud crab , flower crab , bowls of red and green chili sauces , sticks of fried ubi kayayu ( sweet potato ) , and asam pedis ( spicy fish ) . It was one of the tastiest meals I have ever eaten . The following morning we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lay about a mile away at the end of a rough path . This village was built not over the water but on land . Its principal feature was a school , run by the Indonesian government , which was alive with smiling , rambunctious children . We arrived just as they were lining up for their morning assembly . We did n't speak their language , and they did n't speak ours , but it made no difference . The girls were proud to show us around their school , the boys were anxious to show off their skills at kickball , and they all wanted to have their pictures taken . We headed back to the Grand Banks and cast off for a run back across the Selat Riau to the southeast shore of Batam and a brief lunchtime stop at Tg Piayu . We took the dinghy inshore for a closer look at the houses and again were greeted by swarms of laughing children . As time was short , we had to proceed on up the Selat Bulan , which runs along Batam 's western shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another large condominium and marina complex . The next morning we headed back to Singapore so Anne and I could board a flight to Hong Kong . After the tranquility we had found among the gentle , gracious people of the Riaus , we were reluctant to re-enter the bustling pace of the city . Our hope is that we can return to the Riaus before too many more resorts are completed or too many Singaporean boaters file for their cruising permits . // Grand Banks 46 Europa // <p>
