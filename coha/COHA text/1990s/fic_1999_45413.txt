We 're on our way to the first party of the off-season when he asks me . It 's not that I 'm expecting anything in particular-of the party or of him . He 's driving this flat , straight stretch of Highway 8 r as fast as his old truck and the other cars will let him . The station wagon in front of us turns on its inside lights . A perfect tableau : husband and wife as driver and passenger bent together over a map while their car hurtles onward and Charlie damns them for slowing down . <p> " Do n't worry , we 're early , " I tell him . " We 'll probably be the first ones there . " <p> He lets up . He lets one hand off the steering wheel , onto my thigh , and he says , " After tonight , you want to come up the mountain and live with me ? " <p> Nothing asked so casually can be a simple matter . I 've never seen his cabin , which is somewhere illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running water , I do n't know how he gets it . Like his notions about us , that water must travel far , underground , and arrive suddenly , so that when it spills , only he could take it unsurprised . <p> " Well ? " he asks me , as the station wagon signals a turn . <p> " I do n't think so , Charlie . " He smiles . " I 'll ask you again . " <p> Persistence and subsistence are his specialties . Both cheerful . I tell him , " I know you will . " <p> Until two weeks ago , when he decided he wanted to see me pregnant , we had our routine . He came down off his mountain twice a weekonce for the supermarket and once for me . On his grocery days , I 'd watch from the Sharp Wax windows as he crossed the parking lot . By the way he leaned as if into a wind , in his own brand of hurry , I knew he sensed me watching . Sometimes , I set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a long-limbed woman . My arm made more than a flutter in the window . He never so much as nodded in reply . <p> Time and a place for everything , he would have said . Fine with me . My place was the Sharp Wax or its summer incarnation , the Sharp Wheel Bike Repair , yes , but my time did not overlap his groceries . Once in a while he came down an extra day of the week . That meant he forgot to buy an onion , or one of his good friends was having a party , or he was desperate . <p> On my days , in season , he stopped by work . The shop 's set up like a hat check , with a counter across the narrow front room . The customers hand their skis over for service , and whoever 's clerking sets them in a rack . Behind the rack , the shop makes a U-turn into the workroom . Like overgrown elves , sometimes even merrily whistling along with the radio , we work at skis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked in like a customer , except he carried nothing , or once in a while a box of candy , which he held behind his back because he has friends everywhere in this town and it embarrassed him to court me . The last ski-lift would have run its course , and the sunset was always a pinkish glow on the snow and in the windows . He crowded in behind the jostle of tourists and other skiers . He would n't elbow his way to the front and ask the clerk to yell my name around the corner . I liked his bouts of timidity , which are rare now . Because I 'd seen him shy , I never had to worry he might strangle me when he laced his fingers behind my neck . <p> Charlie has a large , square face and a likewise blocky body . He has a blond mustache my mother warned me against . She said , " A man with a mustache is hiding something . " She also said , " Why do n't you ask him ? You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes are a bit too close together , or maybe they just look too close , being so dark and bright a blue I used to think he wore colored contact lenses . Our first time in bed together , I checked . He was staring straight up at my shoulder or the ceiling . I leaned to kiss him between the eyebrows , and I looked close at those eyes . No plastic . In the spirit of things , his eyes ' freedom from correction elated me . <p> That was six weeks after we met . It was complicated , waiting that long , but I did . When I met him , I was a tourist . By the time we slept together , I 'd found a dog and settled in . <p> I stayed in town , and we lasted , to everyone who half-cared 's surprise . At parties , men I do n't recognize still come up to me , while Charlie 's off smoking or throwing horseshoes or flirting with an ex , and say , " Congratulations . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and no girl 's ever put up with him this long . " <p> But things have changed , and I can see that added sharpness in his face every time we have sex . He 's calculating how long it will be before my body changes , fattens , takes on water and substance to cushion the few cells that will become his child . I doubt he thinks much about an actual baby , a possible sloppy wailer . By the way he talks sometimes , I bet he 's planning on some homunculus , a curled man the size of a fingernail clipping , just like him except smaller and wizened , caught up in my tissue , getting ready to spring . <p> It 's just as well that he 's impractical about it . I 'm still faithful to the pill , though he thinks I 've given it up . Every night of the first twenty-one , I swallow a tiny white button , and for the last seven , placebos the orange color of baby aspirin . I can count on my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like anticipation , to take them . My pills are the kind with the most convenient packaging . They 're easy to conceal ; they come in their own vinyl wallet the size of a credit card . <p> Unless you 're born here , you do n't get used to the sight of the mountains , you just learn to talk about it less . After a while , if you catch yourself commenting on the beauty , you feel cheapened , as if you 're doing a mini-ad for whatever tourists might be in hearing distance . Back when I was a tourist , there was a moment in the river . He was our hired guide , our fly-fishing teacher . He scanned the red rock across the way and made a sentimental noise in his throat . I watched him roll his eyes and blush . My mother , up river , yelled out , " Heyshoot-I think I lost a bite . " <p> He waded off to her . For his sake and for our last traces of family pride , I made an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cared about catching a fish . I learned to cast the line out so it would travel at a right angle to the banks . I watched for strikes . There were none . All the while , I kept to myself these sudden rushes : Here I am , thigh deep in a river , thigh deep in a river . <p> He led us into the deeper water where the current pulled more strongly . My mother caught a rainbow trout , which he held , we admired , and he released . My father and brother were around a bend with their own teacher . They never saw her trout and pretended not to believe in it , later . We knew . He left my mother to try again and led me out to where the river could lift me off my feet . <p> " Do n't worry , " he said . He braced his leg against mine . <p> " Would you call that a good fish she got ? " He laid his hand on the downriver hip . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quiet now . Just wait . " <p> I let him fight the river for me . It was passive resistance , what he had to do . He kept me in place and I kept on casting . Line after line onto the water . That and standing with him was enough exercise . At the end of the day , as we were stepping out of our waders and waiting for the other trio to come in , he said , " We have this guarantee everyone will catch a fish . I 'm fishing on my own tomorrow . You coming back out with me ? " <p> My mother watched me with a birthday-party kind of smile . I said , " I think I got their money 's worth . " <p> She said , " Honey , do n't be rude . " <p> " No , it 's up to her . Well , anyway , you 're entitled to another lesson . You can ask for a different teacher , but they 'll put you with a group . " <p> Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . He lowered his chin . I thought this was practiced ; he must have known how it deepened his eyecolor . <p> " Eight A.M. too early for you ? " <p> " No , " I said . <p> " Okay then . I 'll be waiting right here . " <p> Charlie first kissed me that second day in the river , close to shore where the current was only a knee-deep coldness . Afterward , he held my forearms , showing me all over again how to cast . I wanted to lean against him , but I kept my feet planted . Probably , he 'd learned already I was stronger than I looked . One or two fish jumped . None of them stopped for me . <p> " Be prepared , " I said . " My mother might show up any minute . She wants to tip you . " <p> He coughed when I 'd hoped he would laugh . That slight difference left me certain I 'd misjudged him . The summer before , dating the other new jobless college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation kisses . A man will kiss you if he thinks you expect it , even if you repulse or bore him . At least , the graduated men in my home town will . After a month of bad dates and listless goodnight kisses followed by a month 's work setting up my parents ' mountain house while they vacationed in it , I wanted no sympathy advances . I waded off a few steps to let him know . <p> He stood in the river . I was pretending to fish , play-fishing , wishing the trout their freedom . He smoked . When he 'd finished , he sloshed over to me and rested his hand on my shoulder . It might have been the calmest touch I 'd known up to that time . " I quit , " he said . " You can stick around , but I do n't plan on working for your family . " <p> Until the late promise of progeny , that was the last we spent daytime together . So mostly when I think of him-I might be working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a video , washing my dog Plato , or painting one of the ponderous blanket chests the Sharp Wax owner lets me use his shop to make-I picture him profile in the dark , driving his truck as he is now , moon- or streetlamp-lit and happily disregarding me . <p> This morning I woke up left alone , at home in my parents ' vacation house . Just me and the bedclothes that smelled of Charlie 's hair and skin . Even the false getting of pregnancy is hard work . Plato has been neglected . In the morning , he sat pointed toward the front door , wagging his stump tail , barking quietly . Oh polite one , waiting to be let out , hoping he 'd run free . Him with the three bullet scars still shining in their constellation around his ears . He 's one of the few dogs in this state that gets walked on a leash . I 'm responsible enough to know where the risks are . <p> Maybe Plato was someone 's hunting dog , before me , but I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not blame on his human next-ofkin . I was hiking when he fell from the trees . Dogs do n't climb trees , was my first thought . He thudded out of a low-hanging branch . Because I stopped still at the sound of him , my feet were the convenience he rolled up against . <p> He wore a bandanna that his blood had blackened . That was what I saw , instead of the three holes in his head . A bandanna : someone cared at least for his image . He lay on his side , part-propped , a yellow dog with crazy eyes , a white belly , and a swollen , eucalyptus-colored tongue . <p> What else could I do but wrap him in my jacket , tie the arms , and bring him to help ? He was heavier than I 'd expected . I have always been soft-hearted toward beings with density . Myself , for instance . More than you 'd expect on sight , I have substance . My blanket-chest projects , too , are almost as heavy as people . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as coffins . Hope chests and return-to-dust holders . Charlie was joking . He knows I love them too much to see them into the ground . <p> The vet stroked the dog 's neck . It was a Saturday , off-season , so we were the only evident patients . The dog 's fat and fur rippled under the vet 's fingers , and my presence lightened . The dog whimpered . " Rough time , huh ? You 'll be okay now , " the vet said . He spread one hand on the dog 's flank , pinning him gently , and pulled the fur back from the holes . <p> There were painkillers , tetanus shots , shaving , much scrubbing , a few stitches , a bundle of bandages at the end . The vet let me stay . " Your being here will reassure him . " <p> " He 's not my dog . I came across him , " I said . My housing , my parents ' vacation house , would not abide housepets . The vet kept on working even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to judge by the number of private jets at the airport , any given day , you 'd expect opulence everywhere , even in the town 's pet hospital . Instead , there were single aluminum-hooded bulbs on black wires , molded plastic chairs , heartworm posters , thin wood paneling . No more cozy than a free clinic . Good thing vets have a way of drawing up intimacy around themselves and their patients . Imagine my gynecologist parting my legs to fit my heels in the stirrups , saying , " Rough year down there , poor girl . " <p> The vet took a guess at what happened . He 'd seen it before . The dog got too close to the wrong hunters . They saw a flash of light fur , and they were just the degree of drunk to shoot at it and skim his head . No bullet stayed with him . Otherwise , he 'd have died before I reached that far on my hike . <p> " Are dog skulls thicker ? " I asked . <p> " Depends , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck . " <p> It happened in September . Snow fell past the reception area windows as I wrote my check . The vet wrapped the dog 's new collar in green tissue paper . " You 're Charlie 's girlfriend . " <p> " As far as we can tell . " <p> He smiled . " His latest . " <p> " Absolutely . " My return smile , I hoped , was not brave . <p> " He 's okay . Try to keep making him put up an effort . " <p> " To be honest , I do n't see much of him . " <p> " No one does . Bring the dog back a week from Monday . We 'll get those stitches out . " <p> Before then , under the half-bald lightbulb , he 'd found scars . One the size of a teaspoon 's bowl on the dog 's left hip , one dotted line running between his ribs . <p> " So I 've got myself a dog with enemies . " He uncovered another scar , a blunted triangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Probably friends . " <p> The dog was still woozy in his new jacket-lined grocery box when the vet helped me carry him out to the station wagon , so I could take him home . <p> Before Charlie ever invited me into his household , I could have walked up the mountain to see where he lives . Get Plato a pair of sleddog booties , borrow myself some snowshoes , and up we 'd go . I 've always known he 's there somewhere . I know where he parks his truck , to start . It 's true I 'm curious to see for myself his house , his shack , his cave , his cabin : what his ex-girlfriends wait to talk to me about . <p> Every one of them I 've met is petite , blond , and married . There are twelve ex-girlfriends , all counted , living in this town . The Twelve Aerobicizing Princesses , I call them . They have defined muscles , good skin , and hair that looks to be as insubstantial as bubble bath suds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . To the Aerobicizing Princesses , exercise is a devotion . Every few weeksthis is legend-every princess wears through the soles of another pair of aerobics shoes . <p> Charlie 's consistent standards for selection make a joke of tall , dark , single me . I 'd be a joke , too , if I were more of the same . One of his friends said when Charlie introduced me , " Hey . Finally found you a girl that reaches up past your ribs . " <p> With each princess and me , there comes a moment when she leans forward . She pushes her hair back from her eyes , or she swings an arm so her bracelets jingle . " You have n't been up there yet , have you ? " She nods toward the outdoors , not necessarily toward his mountain . I know what she means . Her mouth closes for a second and her face goes serious . " Well , let me know . He 'll make a lot more sense , believe me , once you do . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , do I believe in human mystery . Though I do n't pretend to understand anyone thoroughly , I do n't imagine either they 've got much shadowed depth to hide . And I ca n't ask the princesses if he ever pestered them to have his babies . What I 'd like , if Plato and I traveled up the mountain , is to find him not at home and to confuse him by leaving some of our scent there awhile . <p> Since Plato has pride , I always muster a little . Today , we hiked a ridge that curves out of sight of Charlie 's slope . The sun hit strong . The snow there 's been almost gone all this month . Plato ran and I ran , too . We both breathed hard . Charlie might have worried for the hypothetical embryo . As I panted , the dog shook his leash . I pictured myself , skin tight , stomach large as a pumpkin , waiting for a baby I would never understand and for Charlie . " I 'll give you one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He crashed up a slope and brought me back a bone , one fist-sized vertebra leftover from another elk Plato 's lost the opportunity to kill . <p> In the early evening , Charlie met me at the airport . My replacement was late for her shift . We waited . I made the next two pots of coffee and microwaved three filled croissants for an overtanned woman whose pilot should have been there already to fly her away . <p> " Can you believe I eat this much ? " she asked , already three bites into a spinach and cheese . " It 's these herbs I 'm taking . I ca n't get full . " <p> Charlie looked at her , then took my hand across the counter . " You want me to call Sis ? She 's probably still sleeping . " <p> Sis , my replacement , was one of his exes . I shook my head no , though they do n't like us to shake our heads behind the counter , for fear we 'll lose a strand into a litigious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the door , outside , the only place in our airport you can still smoke without breaking rules or unspoken standards , Sis came rushing in . Her parka crackled . She really did n't need more than a jean jacket , I thought , as she whistled at Charlie and tiptoed to hook an arm around his neck . <p> He swung her up off her feet , just slightly . When he set her down , she was pointed my way . " You smelled this woman lately ? " he asked me . She giggled . " That 's some perfume . You smell like sugar cookies . " I said , " Vanilla . It 's big now . " <p> " She 's right , " Sis said . " She knows . I ca n't even look at food , at my age . Vanilla cologne 's about the best I can do for myself . " <p> While they played , I hung up my apron . So I was prepared to tell him , " Race you to the truck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run here , before he could loosen his sleeve from her fine gold necklace , where the S-links of it had sunk in . I touched the truckbed first but he had the keys and the parking lot ticket . We were a couple , already busy . We were , I should admit , an hour late setting out for the dinner party . " You 're all aglow , " Charlie said as he started the truck up . <p> " It 's the exercise . Do n't get too hopeful , " I said . My best bet now is to stall his expectations before the necessary disappointments can catch him up . <p> " She must 've called everyone else and told them not to bother . " Our host is drinking when we arrive . He has his own Thermos of something that smells strong , even in the open air behind the house . The crisp cap he 's wearing , from which I 've never seen him parted , I always mistake for a captain 's hat . Ahoy , matey . Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 've been hugged and kissed hello , Charlie 's been slapped on the shoulder . I 've been off to the washroom , discreetly , so the men could talk . Music 's playing out the kitchen 's open windows . Billie Holiday , " Body and Soul " : the host has given up calling this a party . We might still be fed dinner . On that , it 's too early to tell . <p> " She was a damn good woman , do n't you think ? " Charlie nods . He might mean his wife , one of the princesses , who left him and left town this morning ; or his dead mother ; or Billie Holiday . <p> " You two decide . Are you staying ? " We both nod . He ducks into the house . <p> " Make us a couple of your Bloody Marys , " Charlie calls after him . <p> " I 've noticed you do n't mind when I drink , " I say . Charlie shrugs , smiles . " The baby 's perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stomach . Our feet crunch the gravel in what would be a barnyard , were it stocked with other animals . With commoners . Our host keeps peacocks , llamas , and retiring pygmy goats . In the kitchen , cabinet doors creak and shut . <p> " Poor fool , " Charlie whispers . The man 's strung candle-holding jelly jars from the fence posts . The last shreds of jar labels cast shadows on our jeans . His wife , one of the twelve , has left him for a recording artist she met in addiction treatment . Charlie says the recording artist has made of himself a has-been ; he 'll never have another good song in him , now that he 's been cured of drinking . He tells me this , I think , so I will be a better guest to his friend , the jilted . Anyway , he does n't name names . <p> Just as our host steps outdoors , bearing low a tray of three flaming drinks , the peacocks begin to scream . I thought I was used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's really more human than exotic . The peacock voices , last time , contrasted well with the princess 's , which was bubbly and dry , like her hair . But she 's gone , and the peacocks do n't sleep , even after dark . At the second scream , I jump . Charlie cups his hand to the back of my head . <p> " I 'll give you your damn Bloody Marys later , " the host says , speaking toward Charlie but delivering my drink first , the very second the gas-stove-like flames fold in over themselves and die . " Just do n't forget them , " Charlie says . " You can stop right now being cheerful . We 're here for the long haul . " <p> He 's taken the host 's elbow , a larger elbow than most people would choose to support . Charlie stands still , temporarily all used up , one hand on the host 's elbow , one hand on my head . The drink 's more sweet than warm . A goat scrambles to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are bowling pins mixed in with the wood . I go ahead and drink Charlie 's glassful , too . <p> By the time we 're in an advanced round of Bloody Marys , I ca n't say what happened to the third flaming drink , the host 's . Did I drink it or throw it in the weeds , saying , " Fertilizer ? " Half-heartedly I believe there was a moment , not long ago , when I wished time would stop to accommodate my happy drunken balance , but it did n't . Now , balance missing , we 're perched in the doorway , the host inside and the two of us out , squatting there , eating burnt toast and artichoke dip from a TV tray set across the threshold . <p> " It 's like a discovery . Burned toast ! " Charlie says . We crunch . <p> " I hate it , " our host answers . <p> " Oh God , it 's starting , " I say , but I only tell them , " Ruin , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pester me enough to dispel what I 'm seeing : myself drunk and bloated , going into labor stuck up on the side of the mountain , in the tight shell of Charlie 's cabin . But for now , we 're safe . No one risks tumbling down . When we sway , we grab shirts or wrists or hips , whatever . <p> " She was born morose , " Charlie says . " Morosa . " He tips his head back against the doorjamb . He 's smiling a little , proud to have named me . The host 's hand swoops out , straightening me back over my haunches and the balls of my feet . <p> Charlie says , " Morosa and child . " Laughing , he rests a hand on my thigh . " She 'd be a virgin mother if it was n't too late . " <p> With my hand 's heel , I push him . Gently , he rocks . He says to our host , " Do n't you think the worst drinking starts with friendship ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . " <p> Our host pours more vodka into his thermos . " You still want the new llama ? He 's ready , " he says . <p> " Oliver ? You mean , Oliver the llama ? I 've wanted him since I set eyes on his parents . " <p> Our host says , " He 'll be a good llama . I 'll let you buy him in the morning . " <p> When he stands , he 's a miraculous height over us , like a president or someone else 's father . For goodnight , he waves the thermos our way . <p> " You should n't be here alone , " Charlie says . " We 're staying over . " Our host exhales sloppily . " You could have your baby here , if you wanted , " he tells me , speaking in Charlie 's direction , before he leaves us . We listen to his footsteps , to the water running through the pipes . Then I know as if I 've heard it that in some back room he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . Subtle man , moving what I 'd just forgotten . But I 'm leaning against him , curled into him where he 's curled to the doorjamb , and he laces his fingers over my ribs . <p> " We could probably find Oliver 's stall , " he says . We do n't start up . We watch the votives and their shadows flicker , sputter , disappear . The peacocks have quieted . Charlie kisses my hair . <p> " Once I 've trained him , we can pack your things on Oliver . I 'll lead <p> you both up the mountain . " " You expect too much , Charlie . " <p> " I 'll build a room . You 'll have your own room to make your coffins . We 'll drag them back downhill to the truck . Oliver 'll drag them . You can make a toboggan , or , what are those things , a sledge .

Let 's go inside . " <p> I shake my head . Three votives are persisting . I want to see which will be the last alive . <p> Charlie jolts awake , and he wakes me , too . One candle 's left burning . " Oliver 's got wise eyes , but you ca n't look in them , " he says . <p> In the morning , my back 's crooked from sleeping on the livingroom 's stone hearth . I 'm wrist deep in soot . The host brings me granola for breakfast and a damp facecloth . <p> " I can drop you at your house , " he says . <p> " Did he take Oliver ? " I ask . <p> " You want to see him ? " <p> " I do . I do n't know why . " <p> On the way to his far pasture , where Oliver 's waiting with most of the llama herd , the host takes my hand . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap-tapping my nails , and I 'm afraid that any second , without this distraction , he might rant or sob . <p> He says , " Some other time , you ask me . I 'll draw you a map to where Charlie lives . " <p> Oliver takes no notice of us . He holds his chin high , like he 's listening to music and smelling a meal , all at once . He 's pointed toward the dinosaur mountains , not Charlie 's , but the gray slopes where they 've found all the bones . <p> " He 'll be all right , you think , up there alone with Charlie ? " The host shrugs . " Llamas are made for mountains . If it does n't work out with Charlie , I 'll have him back . " <p> Last night , Charlie traced ash circles on my stomach . He traced them and traced them and brushed them away . We were going to fall asleep together , alone in the house because the host was a heavy sleeper . He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dog brushes . " He laughed . " Some day when our children are older , I 'm going to walk to your parents ' doorstep and pay for you with three bags of wool . " <p> But we do n't have bride prices , and Charlie has never visited when my parents are in town . Plato knocks me over when I open the door . Right off I grab his scruff and his collar . He looks sideways , tongue swagging . He means to say , Do n't hurt me . It 's an insult , I think . Do n't hurt me , you who call yourself my friend . <p> Some wrongs , you ca n't make up for with dog biscuits . He has n't wet the carpet or lifted his leg on the oven door , though he had an afternoon and night of opportunities . " Good dog , " I say . " I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . " This while clipping his leash to his collar . He smells like curry . I ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to make me know he 's the better of us two . <p> We walk up and down the driveway . He bites at weeds by the car tires . I pull him up short . When I put him in the back seat , I can tell he 's waiting to settle up with me . There 's one park in town with a fence around it , a schoolyard that 's mostly concrete , and kids do n't go there on Sundays . That 's where I bring him . The gate squeaks like a dry pump , as if we 're at the end of a long summer . I let Plato off the leash . Once , I saw a man selling a pickup-truckload of cow skulls right here , to tourists . Plato 's nails are like knives on sharpening stones . <p> What I do most carefully is watch him . Otherwise I might turn around while he 's on the school 's far side , out of eyeshot . I might slip out the yard , holding the gate up so the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave him be . Let one of his other , more practiced owners find him and take him back home . <p> Oliver , oh Oliver : the llama , I think , has changed everything . Charlie 's truck 's nowhere in town when we drive through . One of the twelve princesses is a hobby spinner . She 'll spin the yarn-or already has-to make Oliver 's new-life bridle and lead . <p> Oliver is mostly cream-colored , with red-brown thrown across his shoulders and back like another animal 's pelt . She 's making the bridle scarlet . She might be braiding it now , out in the house her husband the woodcarver decorated . He made them an old-fashioned bed-cabinet to sleep in , but the air stayed close and made them both ill . Now they 've rigged up a ventilation system . I know this because no one can visit them without being shown how the air circulates down and over their sheets . <p> After the schoolyard , after casing out the town , Plato and I take ourselves to the health club where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk right in the building . No one minds , here , if a dog walking through a business is not now and never has been trained as a seeing-eye . <p> The music blasts into the hallway and the beat 's got the floor when one of the princesses rushes out , headed my way . She smiles at me , a sympathy smile . A few of them always do this . She stops short , reaches down , and in maybe three moves makes a Kewpie-doll tuft between Plato 's ears . <p> " Did Charlie join , too ? " she asks me . <p> " He 's in the locker room , " I lie . <p> Plato steps forward to nudge her . " Oh , all right , " she says , sighing . She folds down like a girl gymnast on the balance beam . Plato 's not too much for her , hurtling his whole **32;636;TOOLONG weight into her arms and against her leotard . <p> She sweet-talks him . She 's quiet about it , a voice like the child of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Half Plato 's body is wagging . So I know right then that Oliver is now and forever Charlie 's , and gone from my expectations . I take Plato by the collar , saying , " Come on , you . She 's got her own dog . " <p> The princess strides next to me . Princesses have a wider pace than you would think . " I almost forgot . Charlie said I should ask you directly . Do you think you could make me one of those chests you do ? " <p> " Call me at home , or come over . We 'll have to talk about it . " <p> " I do n't mean something gigantic . This size , you know ? " She 's stopped and drawn back on her heels , she 's making strict motions with her arms until the dimensions come clear . <p> " Big enough to fit Plato , " I say . <p> Her face wrinkles up . She coughs . Then she laughs . " You 've got to get out with someone besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me , in all secrecy , that Charlie 's taken possession of Oliver . " I do n't know why I 'm telling you this . Just thought you should know . " <p> " Hold on , " I say . The receiver dangles . Plato 's upstairs , padding through his security rounds . <p> When hand-over-hand I pull up the receiver , the host 's already talking . Coach talk , buck-up talk , stiff-upper-lip talk . " - give up , and you 'll always wonder . You 'll miss him . We 'll all miss it if you ca n't settle him down . " <p> I clear my throat , not daintily . " You should move out of town . Find yourself someone different . " <p> But I know where we 're tending . In the name of community service , there are things I will do . Also , those I wo n't . Yes , I 'd hold this sad man , naked . Yes , I 'd climb up to Charlie 's home and nail a hello note to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lose a baby of Charlie 's ? It might happen . Lend my dog to a princess ? If Plato wishes . Take the occasional extra shift at the airport . Clean my parents ' house , take a shower and tie up my hair before I work behind a food counter . <p> " Could you come over right now ? " he asks , his voice rushing and breaking on the last two words . <p> " Give me a minute . I have to feed Plato . " But before I can even get the car in reverse , I have misgivings . Givings and misgivings , the drive to provide sexual amnesia and the drive to drive up an out-ofuse mountain and hide . Plato makes my decision . He has a bowlful of fresh food that has made its own nutritional gravy , and he 's spurning it just to stare at me through the window . What can I do , but take dog and food along ? I know where Charlie parks . That 's no one 's secret . I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the car off against carbon monoxide poisoning . We 're there all night , breathing . Yes , I tell Plato every story I know . About the girl and the juniper tree , Snow White and Rose Red , the West Wind , the witch house that scrabbles on chicken legs . I do n't know near enough to keep me alive through a thousand nights of Plato 's staring . Toward morning I let Plato out . " The door 's always open , " I yell after him as he disappears . <p> Charlie does n't show , not even in the morning . How sensible . He has a new llama to learn about . What 's worse , by morning , I miss him almost as much as I miss Plato . Here it is : something that all my life , I suppose , will haunt me . Even in old age , if it ever comes , I 'll hear those paws crashing away from me through the sharp weeds . At seventy-at fifty , even-will I remember the particular set of Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least once every late spring ? <p> Except that , in the end-that is to say , now-the rain wakes me up . It falls persistently , like Plato stalking . It might be any time of day . I wake up and pretend to fall back asleep , not pulling my feet into the car . If it were granted me , I would n't mind a more compact body . What comfort , to have less of me flailing . As I am , though , I 'm more like Plato , who is approaching , awkward and always the fool , secretly shifty but eager to please . When he bites my chin , I sit up , push him off , and curse him . He charges again , reading good will in my harsh words . Porcupine quills stand up from his muzzle . My pincushion , my voodoo doll , my love . <p> On some of these trees , ones you would n't expect anyone to come across , there are mining claims , nailed up , the newer ones sleeved in plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand why no one 's tacked up more . <p> Plato rests his head on my knees . His skull 's so heavy I wonder if he 's got lead fillings in his teeth , or buckshot-though the vet never found it-lodged between his ears . I draw every quill out . They 're light as straws , feathers , or fingernails . Some women weave with them , but I would n't know how . <p> " Stick by me , kid , " I tell him . The new crunch getting louder in the woods , that 's Charlie . He might not be thinking about me at all , or he might be wondering how to urge a child from me and make me family . Maybe that 's Oliver after him , his new accomplice . Plato runs , tail wagging , out toward the sound and smell of them . Intentions aside , Charlie must be proud of the dog 's fawning . Then all three-man , llama , and Plato-are headed like my future , peaceable or not , this way . <p>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
