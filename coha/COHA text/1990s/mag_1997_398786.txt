// It 's the kind of question that makes your jaw drop and your chest fill with the simultaneous urge to gulp and to laugh . It 's the tricky question . And kids are sure to ask one when you least expect it . Such inquiries are tough to respond to because often you 're not sure of the answer yourself , says Kenneth Gorfinkle , Ph.D. , assistant clinical professor of psychology at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center , in New York City . Or you 're not certain that your child is old enough to hear your explanation . To help you come up with well-thoughtout answers ahead of time , we 've compiled a list of some of the most frequently popped questions , with age-appropriate responses . 1 . How much money do you make ? You probably want to discuss your income with your child about as much as you want to watch another episode of Barney , but offering no response is n't the answer . That will only make the child worry , says Neale Godfrey , author of A Penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , We 're lucky that Mommy and Daddy work and that we have enough money to have food , clothes , and a house , and some left over to give to people who are n't as lucky as we are , " ' Godfrey says . AGES 5 TO 8 : Giving the same information as above should work , but now you can discuss more than just earning . Says Godfrey , " Children this age can understand that you have to spend your money wisely and that some of it should be saved . " AGES 8 AND UP : Emphasize that you have enough money to pay for the things you need , but also explain that you pay for things the kids ca n't see-car insurance , mortgage , electricity . Now is the time to tell them more about your income if you feel comfortable . 2 . Where do babies come from ? You must have known that there would come a day when you 'd face this question . Be glad your kid is coming to you for information . AGES 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polland , Ph.D. , author of The Parenting Challenge . You can say something like , " When moms and dads love each other , they cuddle and want to be together . And they may decide to have a baby to love too . " If these words do n't satisfy , elaborate on your answer , a little at a time . AGES 5 TO 8 : While you may be tempted to pull cabbage and celery out of the fridge as visual aids , resist the urge . Answering in simple , straightforward terms beats using metaphors , says Anne Bernstein , Ph.D. , author of Flight of the Stork : What Children Think ( And When ) About Sex and Family Building . Start by saying , " Sperm grow in a special place in the testicles and come out through the penis . An egg is located in the mother 's ovary and travels through a tube to a place near the vagina . The vagina is a tunnel to where the egg is . If a father puts his penis in a mother 's vagina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sperm could go through to where the egg is and a baby will start to grow inside the mother . " AGES 8 AND UP : Communicate the facts , but also your values . " You could say something like , One of the things that 's important to me is that sex takes place in a loving relationship ( or a marital relationship ) , " ' Bernstein says . 3 . Why did you say on the phone that we 're eating dinner when we 're not ? The white lie-so easy to tell , so hard to explain . AGES 3 TO 5 : If your child catches you , fess up . " Explain , You 're right . I did lie because I did n't feel like talking , and I 'll try not to do it again , " ' says Sharon Lamb , coeditor of The Emergence of Morality in Young Children . AGES 5 TO 8 : By age 7 , kids are more sophisticated . You could explain , " It was easier to lie , but the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk right now . " " A child this age can understand that you lied because you were in a certain situation , not because you 're a habitual liar . AGES 8 AND UP : Say , " I really do n't like lying . Adults should n't do it , and kids should n't either . Let me tell you why I did it in this case , and why I 'll try not to do it again . " 4 . What happens after you die ? Philosophers have spent years debating this one , so you need n't feel inadequate if you struggle with it too . AGES 3 TO 5 : Experts suggest a matter-of-fact approach that includes a reference to nature . For example , " Remember that dead bird ? It was n't moving . Its heart was n't beating . It was peaceful , but it had no life . " You might also share your religious beliefs , says Rabbi Marc Gellman , Ph.D. , coauthor of How Do You Spell God ? " Spiritual traditions teach that dying is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after death . " AGES 5 TO 8 : Explain that after you die , your organs stop working . Many children will continue to ask questionsabout bodies buried in the ground , about going to heaven . Answer each question , but do n't give out more information than they 're looking for . AGES 8 AND UP : If you want to impart your spiritual beliefs about an afterlife , children this age are receptive . Photograph Who do you love best in our family // 5 . Are you going to die ? AGES 3 TO 5 : Resist the realistic but frightening , " Of course I 'm going to die . " A better choice : " I 'm healthy and I expect to live a long , long time . " AGES 5 TO 8 : As children get older , the response is similar , but you might also want to point out that although everyone eventually dies , you try to stay healthy by going to the doctor for checkups , eating right , and exercising . AGES 8 AND UP : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary illness in the family that your child already knows about . In that case , say that you are taking all the steps you can to protect yourself . 6 . Who do you love best in our family ? You probably love each of your children differently , and that 's the right response . It may not completely satisfy your child , however . " The kid really wants to hear that you love her the best , " says Lawrence Balter , Ph.D. , professor of applied psychology at New York University , and author of several best-selling books on child rearing . Balter 's suggestion : " There are different kinds of love . I love Daddy because he is my partner and husband . You 're my firstborn ( or second-born or third-born ) , so I love you the most of any firstborn child in the world . " What your child wants to know is that you love her a lot , adds Adele Faber , coauthor of Siblings Without Rivalry . " Say , You are my only Jenny , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has your smile , your thoughts and feelings , your way of doing things . I am so lucky to be your mom . " ' 7 . If Mommy 's Jewish and Daddy 's Catholic , then what am I ? Long before your child gets to first grade , you 'll probably want to pick one religion , advises Doris Ullendorff , a family therapist who leads workshops for interfaith couples at the 92nd Street Y , in New York City . Depending on what you 've decided , tell her in which faith she is being raised . Otherwise , she may feel confused and upset , especially this time of year . " If you bring your child up without a religion , " contends Rabbi Marc Gellman , " then you deny her roots and a sense of origin . " For the growing number of couples who choose to bring up their children in both parents ' faiths , the best response is , " Mommy 's Jewish and Daddy 's Catholic , and we want to share with you the things we love about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever smoke pot ? " No , I never did , and I never want you to either . " If you can say that , fine . But for many parents , the truth is n't so simple . " Be as honest as you can , but use your judgment to reveal as much as you think your child can handle , " says Leigh Leventhal , spokeswoman for the Partnership for a Drug-Free America . AGES 5 TO 8 : " Why do you ask ? " is always a good first response . Your child might say something like , " I saw people on TV smoking it " or " Someone asked me if I wanted to try it , and I did n't know what to say . " This can be your chance to explain that drugs , while they may seem glamorous , can be dangerous and addictive . Photograph Did you ever smoke pot ? // AGES 8 AND UP : Reveal your past judiciously and within a context . " Kids want clear messages , " says Alyse Booth , vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Columbia University . " Even after you 've admitted your use , you can tell them that drugs are not acceptable in your house . Tell them that if they want to be successful , have a career , and be a winner , their hopes can be thwarted by using drugs . " 9 . Why did n't you give any money to that homeless man in the street ? AGES 3 TO 5 : Use this opportunity to talk about strangers with your child , suggests Neale Godfrey . " That person was a stranger , and remember I told you that there are good and bad strangers ? Well , I did n't know if that was a good stranger or a bad stranger , so that 's why I did n't give him money . " You do n't want your child to equate poor with bad . AGES 5 TO 8 : You might tell your child that if he 'd like to give some of his own money to a homeless person , that 's fine ; it 's much more tangible than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give to the homeless through charitable organizations . And you can include your child the next time you make a donation . AGES 8 AND UP : Have your child assist you in researching various homeless organizations , then discuss which you would like to help-either individually or together . 10 . Why is that lady a different color than me ? AGES 3 TO 5 : " Her skin is brown or white because her parents ' skin is brown or white , " is the simplest answer , says Barbara Mathias , coauthor of 40 Ways to Raise a Nonracist Child . " You do n't have to go into genetics , and you do n't have to emphasize how we are all the same . You are acknowledging a difference , which is.what the child wants . " AGES 5 TO 8 : A child this age probably wo n't ask such a simplistic question , but you might overhear your kid and another laughing or joking about race differences . " At that point , it 's a parent 's duty to put the child in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that situation ? " ' Mathias suggests . " You do n't have to shame them , but you have to get them to think . " AGES 8 AND UP : Your child might make an observation such as " All the professional athletes are black " or " Why are all teachers white ? " A good answer , according to Derek Hopson , Ph.D. , a clinical psychologist in Middlefield , CT , and coauthor of Raising the Rainbow Generation : Teaching Your Children to Be Successful in a Multicultural Society : " I know it seems that way , but in fact it 's not true . There are plenty of white athletes or black teachers . " Then follow up with books or TV programs that highlight the achievements of minorities . Photograph Where do babies come from ?
