<p> Maria and Jaime DelaRosa hired a contractor to install a basement bathroom last year . Almost immediately , they started smelling sewer water . Eventually , sewage backed up into the basement . <p> The DelaRosas called in another plumber to evaluate the situation . " He said they did a lousy job on this ; get them to come back and do it right , " Maria DelaRosa said . <p> Easier said than done . <p> DelaRosa wanted them not only to fix the plumbing but also to repair the water damage . The contractor finally sent workers in October , some 17 months after the work was first done . They tore up the bathroom walls and ripped up the basement floor , exposing broken drain tile and allowing more sewer water to flow into the basement . <p> Then they left and have n't done any work since . <p> For this the DelaRosas had paid $ 6,600 . Angry , they called the city 's Department of Consumer Services , which sent out an inspector . He cited the contractor  --  HCP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3851 N. Cicero . The violations included failure to have home remodeling , electrician 's and plumber 's licenses ; failure to get building permits , and failure to perform the job . <p> The city also said the plumbing was not properly vented and that a sump pump was installed instead of the required ejector pump . A Dec. 15 court date is set . <p> A Sun-Times call to Venture General was answered by a woman who said her name was Karen but who declined to give her last name or her title . <p> " I 'm not disputing that she ( Maria DelaRosa ) has something to be unhappy about ; we 're not out to hurt anybody , " she said , laying the blame on a subcontractor who turned out to be no good . <p> " It 's being taken care of , " she said . Repair work will begin as soon as building permits are secured . <p> Said Caroline Shoenberger , Chicago 's commissioner of consumer services : " I guess we can be optimistic , but we 're not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type of home repair complaints received by her office , which got 874 complaints in 1994 on everything from home remodeling to air conditioner repair . The office was able to bring consumer and contractor together to resolve half of those complaints , and started legal proceedings in the other half . <p> Here 's a list of do 's and don'ts designed to keep you from having to use Shoenberger 's office : <p> Get several estimates or competing bids . It 's common sense , but sometimes homeowners can be seduced into abandoning common sense . <p> Example : A workman knocks on your door and says , " We just finished a job down the street and have roofing materials left over , so we could do your roof and just charge you labor . " Or , " We were just driving by and noticed your roof is in terrible shape . Do n't wait a week to get it done . We could start on it today . " These are almost certainly scams , often pulled on the elderly . <p> Check out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints about businesses in the Chicago area . It can tell you how long the contractor has been in business , how many complaints have been filed against a firm , what types of complaints and whether they 've been resolved . <p> The bureau also will work with you and the contractor to resolve the matter , said Steve Bernas , the bureau 's director of operations . <p> If the DelaRosas had called the Better Business Bureau , ( 312 ) 346-3313 , they would have found that Venture General has had 20 complaints filed against it over the past three years . Sixteen of the complaints had been resolved and in four cases the company did not respond , Bernas said . <p> Get references and check them out . Ask contractors for lists of satisfied customers from a few months back and a few years back , said Gil Fergus , chief of the consumer fraud bureau of the Illinois Attorney General 's Office . Call these folks and ask if they were satisfied with the work . <p> Ask friends , neighbors and relatives to recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open a phone book and start calling , " Shoenberger said . <p> Make sure he 's licensed . You can check if a contractor is licensed in the city by calling Consumer Services at ( 312 ) 744-9400 . In the suburbs , call the village hall and ask for the licensing department . <p> Get it in writing . Verbal assurances mean nothing . A written contract specifies what is to be done and how soon . Unfortunately , most homeowners simply sign the proposal offered by the contractor , said Joan Riordan , a Chicago real estate lawyer . <p> Such contracts do little to protect homeowners , especially when it comes to mechanics ' liens filed by subcontractors and suppliers , she said . Liens are common , and a good contract will protect you by requiring a waiver , ideally before the second payment , she said . <p> When it comes to stuff like this , a lawyer might be needed . Riordan charges $ 125 an hour  --  maybe not worth it on a $ 500 plumbing job . But if you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth springing for a couple hours of a lawyer 's time . <p> Call the Chicago Bar Association Lawyer Referral Service at ( 312 ) 554-2001 to find a lawyer . <p> A good contract does not guarantee you wo n't have any problems , but it will protect you if problems do crop up . <p> Do n't pay too much money upfront . Never , never pay the whole amount upfront . Honest contractors wo n't ask for the entire amount upfront , but they will want something . One-third or one-half of the contract amount is common , but Fergus thinks that 's way too much . <p> Such amounts are always negotiable . He likes 10 percent at the beginning with most of the rest paid in frequent intervals while the job is in progress . However , hold back perhaps 10 percent until the job is finished and you 're satisfied with the work , he said . <p> Make sure a building permit has been issued . It 's the job of the contractor to get the permits , but to protect yourself , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't find one , tell the contractor to get it . <p> Starting a job without a permit can mean a delay of a week or longer if a city inspector drops by and halts work . <p> Getting a permit ensures that city codes will be satisfied and would eliminate expensive corrective work if it 's done wrong in the first place , Shoenberger said . <p> " Just protect yourself so that you 're not a lamb going to the slaughter , " Shoenberger said . <p> This time of year many homeowners are finding problems with their furnaces . The city does not have licenses for furnace repair , although a general home remodeling license would cover it , Shoenberger said . <p> In an emergency , ask a friend or neighbor to recommend someone , but in the long run it 's best to develop a good relationswhip with a repairman you can trust . <p> Have your furnace checked out periodically by someone you 've established a relationship with , so that when an emergency crops up you can call someone you trust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wait for your teeth to fall out before you find a dentist , " Shoenberger said . <p> Bill Rumbler is a Chicago Sun-Times staff writer . @x Ever wonder why we envision scientists surrounded by bubbling beakers , lobbyists enjoying lavish dinners in fancy steakhouses , or lawyers making stirring closing statements in mahogany-lined courtrooms ? There are plenty of powerful influences that shape popular perceptions of jobs , as well as the choices we make about our own career paths . Parents , friends , and teachers are often instrumental -- as is Hollywood . Perhaps you became a prosecutor after growing up watching episodes of Law &; Order , or you pursued journalism after seeing Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman in All the President 's Men . Since these perceptions often verge far from reality , it 's smart to talk to people who are doing the work that interests you and can tell you what the job is really like . Maybe it involves a lot more paperwork than you had anticipated , or maybe the work environment is less glamorous than you 'd imagined . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media -- especially those that are on the bleeding edge of technology or in a highly specialized industry . So , how do you choose a career with confidence that the degree you 're paying thousands of dollars for wo n't fall out of favor in this era of rapidly changing technology and government policy ? It 's a toughie , but it pays to do your research . You 're looking for work that speaks to you as well as work that will stay relevant over the next couple of decades . With that in mind . U.S. News took a closer look at 15 careers that are overrated , ahead of the curve , or among the best-kept secrets in the job universe : Overrated Careers Architect . When screenwriters give a hero a career , it 's often architecture . Think Walter Pidgeon in Mrs. Miniver and Adam Sandler in Click . When Matt Dillon attempts to impress Cameron Diaz in There 's Something About Mary , he pretends to be an architect . Too bad about the reality : Not only is the housing decline souring the job market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're downloading premade blueprints developed by top architects , or having lower-cost interior/exterior designers or building contractors design their structures . Recent job satisfaction surveys paint a mixed picture : One gave architecture high marks , but another rated it very low . Professor . You think you 'll get to live a life of the mind on a halcyon campus and help students to flower and conduct research that will make a difference . And with the cushy 30-week school year , you 'll have lots of time off . The average time it takes to get a Ph.D . is 10 years . Then , if you land a job , achieving tenure takes seven years and requires carrying a full teaching load , advising students , publishing original research , and serving on committees . You can forget taking the summer off . Frustrations vary from bureaucracy and office politics to lack of ideological diversity . On many campuses , political correctness is rampant . Farmer . Ever more people romanticize becoming an organic/sustainable farmer , but farming is a tough row to hoe . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premium prices that small-scale , organic farmers must charge . If you decide to grow nonorganically , you may have to liberally use the very agrochemicals and genetically modified seed you had hoped to avoid . To survive , you 'll most likely have to hire workers to tend the field . With millions of migrant workers willing to do that for near minimum wage , that option will probably be irresistible . And ( the coup de grce ) you may indeed need a college degree , probably in agribusiness , to teach you the business practices that corporations use to keep prices down . Police Officer . Cops are often idealists who feel they 're there to uphold the law and safeguard innocent citizens , one reason the uniform carries authority . But police work is stressful and dangerous , especially in high-crime areas . On the street , cops often feel they 're doing little more than keeping a lid on problems that are far bigger than they can control . Police officers also do a surprising amount of paperwork ; every intervention must be carefully documented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action , not triplicate copies . Nonprofit Manager . Many people want a career in which they can " make a difference . " For many , that means a career helping manage a nonprofit organization that works , for example , on environmental issues , children 's rights , or antipoverty campaigns . But many of your supervisees end up being volunteers , who , on average , tend to be less competent and reliable than paid employees . Also , much of the job often involves fundraising , which many people dislike . Plus , you 're usually expected to be so dedicated to the cause that you 're willing to work long hours for little pay . Despite all that , nonprofit management jobs that pay a good salary are difficult to find , especially now in our slow economy -- people donate less in tough times . Best-Kept-Secret Careers Accent-Reduction Specialist . A customer-service representative in India speaks perfect English but wants an accent that 's more clearly understood by Americans . A Chinese scientist at a government lab speaks poor English in such a heavy accent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thick Brooklyn , Spanish , or Southern accents , and the company believes they 'll be more credible if they sound more like TV news anchors . These are typically the clients of accent-reduction specialists , also known as accent neutralization or accent modification specialists . Demand for this specialty is strong . Most accent-reduction specialists come from the ranks of speech therapists or **28;3121;TOOLONG teachers . Casting Director . You 've just finished reading the script for a commercial , a training video , or a movie , and consulted with the director . Now , it 's your job to come up with the actors -- including those 50 beefy oarsman extras . You then schedule an audition for the actors and , along with the director , run the audition . To maintain a fresh stable of talent , you 're continually talking to actors ' agents , seeing plays , gaining insight from drama department chairs , trolling actor databases , and perhaps offering seminars on how to land acting roles . To become a casting director , you need an eye for quickly discerning if an actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help you remember which actors to invite to the audition . And patience is key . It often takes a long time to find the right person . Finally , at auditions , you 're in charge of getting actors to relax so they can present their best selves . Orthoptist . Ophthalmologists ( physicians who specialize in eyes ) hire orthoptists to measure patients ' vision and perform diagnostic tests to evaluate disorders such as strabismus ( cross-eye ) and amblyopia ( lazy eye . ) The orthoptist then helps the ophthalmologist develop a treatment plan , which may include eye exercises , drugs , or surgery . The orthoptist typically teaches the exercises to the patients , who usually are kids . The position requires the ability to relate to children , including those with disabilities beyond the ocular . Prospect Researcher . One of nonprofits ' hidden heroes is the prospect researcher , who mainly uses computers to identify target donors -- for example , wealthy people who have donated to similar causes . A prospect researcher will also dig up more information about a potential major donor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospect 's hobbies , pet peeves , past donations , and emotional hot buttons . If you 'd like to direct your detective and information junkie proclivities to nonprofit ends , prospect research might be on target for you . Creative Perfumer . If you have a good nose , memory for fragrance , and are n't too scared by a few years of chemistry-laden courses , then creative perfumer might be up your alley . After all , you devise fragrances all day . The job does require great patience : It can take hundreds of tries to get the right note in a fragrance , and then consumer testers often send you back to the drawing board . Ahead of the Curve Solar Installer . Barack Obama has promised to create 5 million green-collar jobs , and this is as green as it gets . A career as a solar installer is a natural for electricians looking for more work ( like the many electricians laid off by the auto industry ) . But thanks to the high demand , the career may be viable for any green-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend most of the workday on a roof , often a pitched one . Remember : You must be in great shape , as you 'll be hauling heavy equipment from ground to roof . Wellness Coach . Fitness trainers have long been popular , but growing numbers of people also want support in their efforts to eat less , stop smoking or drinking , and reduce stress . These people are starting to seek out wellness coaches . This trend should accelerate if -- as is widely predicted -- more of us are pressured by younger , tech-savvy workers , globalization , automation , and the massive influx of immigrants from Asia and Latin America who are willing to work long hours for low pay . Wellness coaches are being hired not only by individuals but by employers and health insurers as an employee perk that 's likely to be cost-effective . Simulation Developer . Whether for entertainment , training , education , or predicting the future , we enjoy and learn more if we 're immersed in a subject . Governments use simulations to predict terrorist strategies , and surgeons use them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of simulations for corporate training will also continue to grow because of the wide availability of broadband and ever faster mobile Internet access . That will enable you to receive training videos in which you are the protagonist on your iPhone or BlackBerry . Alas , the skills required for a career in simulation development are n't trivial : Key is mathematical modeling as well as sophisticated computer programming . Green-Collar Specialist . The effort to control climate change and become energy independent has become the cause of the decade . Expect a bonanza of research , corporate , government regulatory , and consulting jobs . Specializations include industrial carbon footprint reduction , green new construction and retrofits , solar and wind energy , municipal and corporate **32;3151;TOOLONG management , wetlands delineation and restoration , ecotourism , and " smart growth " land use planning . Of course , if the scientific consensus on global warming breaks down or politicians and voters lose interest , jobs may become scarcer . Behavioral Geneticist . For more than 100 years , psychologists have attempted , with modest success , to ameliorate mental problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by exploring their childhood angst . Now , pharmacological approaches are used , also with only moderate success . Recent evidence suggests a more fruitful path tied to the fact that human behavior -- sexual orientation , alcoholism , intelligence , the propensity for violence -- has a genetic component . Researchers and , in coming years , clinicians who specialize in developing and implementing ethical gene-related therapies should be in growing demand .
