When you hear new songs on the radio these days , do they have a familiar ring ? Listen more closely to what 's tickling your subconscious . In many cases you did hear that sound before , maybe long ago . It 's the James Brown beat that 's now in a rapper 's groove , or the recycled ' 60s riff in a current dance- floor hit .

Hammer 's U Ca n't Touch This . <P> That oldies echo in your ears is the result of a high-tech technique , digital sampling , that is turning pop music on its ear .
