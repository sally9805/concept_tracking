The Empire State Strikes Back For all the high hopes , Mario Cuomo has never gone farther than governor of New York ; and soon he may be less than that . But New Yorkers will have their problems and their taxes still . <p> MARIO CUOMO , almost presidential candidate , almost Supreme Court Justice , almost intellectual , and three-term governor of New York , might well lose his last bid for re-election , and not to some real comer , but to a Republican state legislator named George Pataki , a homunculus grown in a retort by Senator Alfonse D'Amato . <p> This is not as big news as it seems , if you know the numbers . Mario Cuomo has rarely been an electoral powerhouse . In 1982 , his first gubernatorial race , he got 51 per cent of the vote against a political tyro . In 1990 , his third race , he got 53 per cent against two tyros who split the anti-Cuomo vote . Only in 1986 did he roll up a landslide ( 65 per cent ) . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colossus , while Pataki-men walk under his huge legs and peep about . <p> Cuomo 's prominence is a testimony to the resonance of his rhetoric , at both the state and the national levels . Until recently , the two levels were mutually reinforcing . If he is vulnerable now , it is because he has lost one of his echo chambers . <p> Cuomo 's verbal gift first showed itself when he beat New York City Mayor Ed Koch in the 1982 Democratic primary . Koch 's loss was widely interpreted as self-destruction . " Have you ever lived in the suburbs ? " Koch asked in a notorious pre-election interview . " It 's sterile . It 's nothing . It 's wasting your life . " But that was n't the whole story . In their last debate , Cuomo went after Koch like a liberal buzz saw . Had Democrats done too much for the poor ? " Hardly enough , " said Cuomo . Koch 's quasi-conservatism would " cut our throats . " Cuomo used his summation to urge voters to take part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was corn , but it was sweet . <p> Governor Cuomo moved up to the big leagues two years later , with his keynote speech at the 1984 Democratic convention . Cuomo assailed Ronald Reagan as a social Darwinian who believed only in " taking care of the strong , " while Democrats " would rather have laws written by . . . the man called the world 's most sincere Democrat , ' St. Francis of Assisi . " Two months later , he delivered a second major address , at Notre Dame , on the subject of abortion . He and his wife , he began disarmingly , believed that " life in the womb should be protected , even if five of nine Justices of the Supreme Court disagree . . . . But not everyone in our society agrees with me and Matilda . " The Catholic officeholder , he concluded , must bow to social consensus . The keynote speech was thunder and lightning ; the Notre Dame speech was earnest and calm . It seemed there was nothing he could not do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning after . Taken together , the 1984 speeches are an intellectual shell game : in San Francisco he brought in saints to judge politicians , while in South Bend he counseled believers to follow the polls . Where is the pea ? Yet the power of his delivery was real enough . He also took aim at targets that liberals really wanted to hit . At the height of Reaganism , Cuomo attacked the pernicious new orthodoxy far more effectively than Tip O'Neill or Walter Mondale . The media ganglia of Washington , D.C. , and New York City took note . fCuomo was rewarded by being considered a long-shot presidential candidate during the next two election cycles . In September 1987 , he took a trip to Moscow ; when he returned , he gave a show-and-tell speech to the Council on Foreign Relations . He 's going global , we all said . In December 1991 , a chartered plane waited at the Albany airport to take him to New Hampshire to make the filing deadline for the primary . He 's going for it , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Government as Usual <p> WHAT DID he do there ? The Republicans attack him as a taxer and a spender . Cuomo denies their charges , and he is frequently correct , though only on points of detail that do not affect the total picture . <p> For instance , Cuomo says that the state government work force has lost more than 17,000 jobs since 1990 , mostly through attrition . But there are still over 15,000 more state employees than there were when he took office in 1983 . There is of course more for state employees to do in New York than in many other places . New York 's state government spends 47 per cent more per capita than the national average . The state has one-tenth of the nation 's welfare recipients and more than a sixth of the nation 's Medicaid expenditures . New York 's Medicaid program , more generous than other states ' , will pick up the bill for a vasectomy or a hair transplant ; the state pays $5,600 per recipient , almost three times what California pays . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the top state-income-tax rate has dropped from 10 per cent to just under 7.9 per cent during his tenure . What he does not say is that each step was wrung out of him by the legislature ; when he signed the last cut , in 1987 , he remarked that " they would have gotten it anyway . " Since 1990 , he has postponed a scheduled cut that would have lowered the top rate still further , to 7 per cent . Cuomo also does not discuss the level at which the top rate kicks in  --  $26,000 , as opposed to $150,000 in New Jersey . The budget he signed this spring had $253 million in miscellaneous tax cuts , but much of this was giving back with one hand what he had taken with the other , such as phasing out hotel and motor-oil taxes he had imposed in 1990 . The budget also extended other taxes  --  a business tax surcharge , a hospital tax  --  which were due to expire . <p> Even so , Cuomo manages to make ends meet only because much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The state imposes programs on localities through unfunded mandates , which they pay for by sales or property taxes  --  with the result that New York 's combined state and local tax burden is the highest in the nation . Cuomo has also resorted to financial gimmicks to balance the budget : raiding insurance and retirement funds ; " selling " state properties to public authorities ; converting short-term debt into long-term bonds . <p> These policies have hovered over the state 's private sector like a Canadian low-pressure system . The refugees from New York 's business climate have made the coast of Connecticut and the swamps of New Jersey bloom . The outflow would have been even worse if Cuomo 's flanks had not been protected , for most of the Bush recession , by a pair of fellow tax kamikazes , New Jersey Governor Jim Florio and Connecticut Governor Lowell Weicker . But even this security is being torn from him . <p> The problem goes well beyond dollars and cents . Cuomo 's impulse to shovel money at the state 's problems has prevented him from thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have experimented with education or welfare reforms , Cuomo has talked around the subjects and done nothing . His discussion of school choice in The New York Idea , a flat and feeble campaign book assembled for him by two state employees , is typical . " Are non-public schools prepared to accept all state regulations and court decisions ? " he asks . Such a system would require " a new state-level bureaucracy . . . to oversee how local tax dollars are spent , to monitor accountability and performance . " In other words , we can try something new , so long as it 's exactly like what we already have . What New York already has in education is a per-pupil expenditure of $9,665 , versus a national average of $6,932  --  along with a high-school graduation rate that is 45th in the nation . <p> The best defense of Cuomo 's record , though he is unlikely to make it , is that his approach to government differs little from that of his predecessors or his peers . Cuomo did not invent the modern welfare state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockefeller , who dug the foundations in 1958 , before the New Frontier was thought of , and who was putting up additions until 1974 , long after the Great Society had ended . Cuomo has not maintained it without help . On all but a few issues , he has proceeded with the cooperation of the permanent majorities in both houses of the state legislature  --  Democrats in the Assembly , Republicans in the Senate . <p> On occasion , the legislature has forced him to cut the income-tax rate . On many occasions , it has tried to force him to reinstitute capital punishment , without success : he has vetoed every death-penalty bill the legislature has passed . ( When it is a question of executing murderers , the Catholic officeholder discovers a stubbornness he believes it is improper to show in defense of fetuses . ) But in every other area of government , Cuomo and the lesser powers that be  --  legislators , constituency groups , pundits  --  uphold the consensus that has governed the Empire State for almost four decades . They hold each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Pataki , it will be because Pataki failed to make a convincing case that he was not cut from the same cloth . Since Pataki is a protege of Senator D'Amato , this is a difficult case to make . Our President-in-Waiting <p> IF CUOMO has been business as usual , why have New Yorkers thought of him as something more ? This is the irony of his double-decker reputation . Even as New York gave him his platform as a national figure , his national reputation made him dazzling to New Yorkers . He was our poet , our President-in-waiting . Did n't the McLaughlin Group tell us so ? Interestingly , Cuomo 's in-state approval ratings , as measured by the Marist poll , began to slide at the moment he was no longer needed as a foil to Ronald Reagan . They peaked at 77 per cent in January 1988 , on the eve of Bushism . By the time he decided not to file in New Hampshire four years later , they had sunk to 50 per cent . They hit 36 per cent in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still under 40 per cent . <p> Of course , he never would have left us . All the talk of the White House and the Supreme Court was self-infatuation  --  ours and his . For Cuomo nurses at his core a profound sense of self-doubt . It shows in the way he governs , trusting only a few old-shoe cronies and his son Andrew . It shows in the late-night and early-morning calls to critical journalists . It showed in a baseball scouting report when he was playing for a Pittsburgh Pirates farm club in 1951 . " Sometimes , " wrote the scout , " I think he has a slight inferiority complex and needs to be told frequently that he has the goods . Like all bright fellows , he is sometimes moody and different than the ordinary person . " <p> Cuomo 's inferiority complex seems to be connected with his ethnicity . Italian jokes of the most frivolous kind send him through the roof ; in The New York Idea , he is still chewing over a slight to his mother from fifty years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood " then inhabited mostly by white Anglo-Saxon Protestants , " three " distinguished-looking women " came to greet Mrs. Cuomo . " You must be the Italian woman , " they said . " Well , we want you to know you are welcome here , but please keep the tops on your garbage pails . " Solemnly , her son adds : " Unchecked , magnified , and sanctioned by the state , " such behavior " is what eventually produced the malignancy of the Holocaust and the ethnic cleansing ' we now see in the former Yugoslavia . " <p> In The Italians , Luigi Barzini argued that the historical Italian antidote to feelings of depression and anxiety was the Baroque . That is certainly Mario Cuomo 's antidote . But it is not only Italians who feel anxiety , or who resort to rhetoric as an anodyne . Unwilling to address our real problems , New Yorkers have resorted to Cuomo as a quack cure . We have slipped behind Texas to be the third largest state in the country , as Bill Murchison gleefully reminded us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks , a lot of dairy farms , a handful of decaying small cities like measle spots , and Gotham  --  the Omphalos , the Wen . It has been pleasant to think that the state that produced Alexander Hamilton and the Roosevelts could still produce a titan . Now that titanhood has finally passed Cuomo by , we may abandon him . It will be harder to abandon the bad habits that have led us to our shrunken state . <p> PHOTO : Mario Cuomo <p> By RICHARD BROOKHISER <p> <p> Mr. Brookhiser , an NR senior editor , is a columnist for the New York Observer . <p>
