How to tell the good ones from the not-so-good ones . // Of all the features that comprise a kitchen , cabinets are the most permanent . Flooring , fixtures , lights , appliances and even countertops can all be changed fairly easily , but cabinets usually stay put . The difference is part cost and part perception . While cabinets can be quite affordable , and not that difficult to install , new cabinets usually signal a new kitchen , top to bottom , and that requires a major investment of cash and commitment . With this information in mind , it pays to learn as much as possible about the range of cabinet options . This means looking beyond the facade - although the facade is also important-to structure , hardware , finishes and accessories . Custom . semicustom and factory stock Prior to the mid-1950s , all cabinets were built-in , or custom-built , in that each set was locally made for a specific kitchen . Today , the boundaries are less clear . Truly custom cabinets are still locally built to maximize specific and unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the options in factory-made components , and the economy of scale they offer , local cabinetmakers find it hard to compete . What custom cabinets still offer is good craftsmanship , full-dimension plywood in the box construction , and customized sizes , details and accessories . While factory components are sized in 3-in. increments , custom cabinets can be made to fill each space , without filler strips . When a kitchen sink needs to be centered under a window , for example , a 2- or 3-in. shortfall can make a big difference . Custom cabinets accommodate such differences and offer greater flexibility . They also allow you to add compatible new cabinets to an existing set . The costs , however , will usually meet or exceed those of high-end factory components . Semicustom cabinets offer the best of both worlds , in that the components are factory-made , but are done so according to each kitchen 's specifications . More economical stock sizes are used to fill most of the space , while a few components are customized to meet site-specific needs . In most cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a few cases , the installer builds certain details or components to round out the construction job . And finally , you will find many factory lines of stock cabinets . These lines consist of mix-and-match components starting at 9 in. in width and graduating in 3-in. increments to about 60 in . Because the manufacturer picks the sizes and the details , and builds in assembly-line fashion , these cabinets are generally the most affordable . Factory lines are offered everywhere , from kitchen specialty shops to lumberyards and home centers . Prices vary with the type of face lumber , accessories , door and drawer construction , type and thickness of the box lumber and the number and quality of shelves and storage features . Assuming a standard L-shape kitchen - with two 10-ft. runs of cabinets , including the usual gaps left for appliances-prices usually range from $1400 to $5000 , with the most popular selections falling in the $3500 category . Keep in mind that these are typical prices for typical homes . You could easily spend $8000 to $10,000 in the same space , using premium-grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for consumers is that competition is fierce at this level . It 's not uncommon to find 20 to 30% price reductions on the most popular models , most months of the year . What 's more , dealers and home centers make shopping easier by providing display kitchens in a variety of styles and prices . These side-by-side comparisons help focus the selection process . Box basics There are two basic cabinet types in use today , faced and unfaced . American-style cabinets have a band of facing lumber-rails and stiles-on the cabinet fronts , usually made of solid wood . The drawers and doors close against this face frame . With European-style unfaced cabinets , the doors are hinged from the cabinet sides and overlap the cabinet edges in all directions . The difference is largely a matter of style , though without center and perimeter supports , faceless cabinets are slightly more accessible . In box construction , the differences are in the thickness and quality of the materials . Within certain limits , it 's safe to say that real wood is better than scrap-wood products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires the most costly materials and methods . Consider , for example , the daily-use contrasts between cabinet boxes and drawer boxes . If a cabinet box survives the shipping , the installation and the plumber , chances are it will stand up to a generation of utensils and groceries , whether it 's made of varnished plywood or vinylwrapped particleboard . Drawers , on the other hand , suffer a lifetime of relentless use , and as long as the kids are around , a few years of abuse too . Drawers should be as sturdy as nature and joinery allow , and as good as you can afford . With this in mind , here are the options . A few high-end factory cabinets use 5/s-in. plywood that is veneered on both sides . Some custom-cabinet makers use 3/-in. plywood for even greater strength and rigidity . When plywood is not used , low- to medium-density particleboard or medium-density fiberboard ( MDF ) takes its place . Particleboard is generally less expensive and durable than MDF , which is quite strong and made of resin-bonded wood fibers . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge and is often used in doors , usually under some form of synthetic finish . When wrapped in vinyl or low-density laminate , however , it 's not easy to tell these composites apart , so make it a point to ask . Most cabinets have 1/s-in. plywood or hardboard backs and - or /2-in. plywood floors . Shelving lumber is usually the same as the box lumber , but varies in thickness between 1/2 and in . One-half-inch shelves can sag in a 36-in. cabinet if you really load them , so if you have limited storage space , you 'll want a thicker shelf The most basic models will have one fixed half-depth shelf in the base units and two in the upper cabinets . Better cabinets may have deeper base shelves and two or three adjustable shelves in the uppers . Premium cabinets often feature pullout storage trays on heavy-duty drawer slides . In these cases , the doors may be hinged conventionally , or fastened directly to the trays , like drawer fronts . Keep in mind that some cabinetmakers will substitute better materials at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base , where water damage is most likely , while opting for fiberboard elsewhere . In similar fashion , you might order better drawer slides and drawer construction for the one or two drawers you know will get the roughest use . Doors and drawers Doors and drawers really make the cabinet when it comes to appearance . While variations abound in detail , most doors fall into a few structural categories . Recessed-panel doors and the more expensive raised-panel and mullioned , glass-pane doors are used on faced cabinets , while plywood , MDF and particleboard doors are used on faced and unfaced cabinets . The most expensive doors are always those made of solid wood , either one piece or paneled . The more dear the wood-cherry , hickory and walnut to name a few examplesthe higher the cost . A reasonable compromise in price and quality is a flat-panel door , in which 1/4-in. veneered plywood is used in place of solid wood , with the frame of the panel still made of solid wood .

The savings are often substantial , and with tough , factory-applied finishes , these doors hold up well under most conditions . As for drawers , plywood and solidwood construction is best . Where weaker materials are used , good-quality mechanical slides can even the score somewhat . Drawer slides range in capacity from 50 to 150 pounds . Avoid , when you can , slides with minimal base support and nylon parts . The best slides are 2-piece affairs that run on bearings and allow the drawer to extend almost completely out . If you ca n't afford the best , look for slides that wrap under both sides of the drawer at least /2 in . How the drawer is constructed is also important . You 'll find several basic designs . In better cabinets , the drawer front is screwed to a framed box , while in lesser cabinets , the drawer box is 3-sided , with the open end stapled directly into mortised slots in the drawer front . The boxes , in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . High-end cabinets typically have solid-wood boxes with dovetailed corners , though glued and stapled corners are also used on some quality cabinets . Finishes Lower-grade stained-wood cabinets are usually sealed with a sprayed lacquer , which produces an attractive finish , but one that is less colorfast . For this reason , most of the better cabinets today are sealed with a catalyzed conversion varnish , which is baked on . The application and curing process takes longer , so the finish is more expensive . But the better finish on factory cabinets give them an edge over locally built custom cabinets . And finally , many MDF-surfaced cabinets are now sealed with a pigmented polyester finish , applied in many layers in a tightly controlled environment . It 's labor intensive and therefore expensive . The resulting finish is tougher than lacquer and usually has a high-luster sheen , which is easy to wipe clean . Not all cabinets these days are sealed with liquid coatings . Those made of particleboard or fiberboard are often covered with synthetic laminates , either plastic , vinyl or PVC . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat-sealed over particleboard or fiberboard . Although both are susceptible to nicks and dings , 4-mil vinyl is tougher than 2-mil . Next on the list is thermofoil plastic , which heat-bonds a film of PVC over fiberboard doors and drawer faces . The thermofoil process is popular on medium-price white cabinets , because it offers a durable , seamless surface that is still affordable . And finally , some very good cabinets are covered with plastic laminates-the same stuff used on countertops-in either colors or simulated wood grains . Some of the woodgrain copies are impressively realistic , though not entirely convincing . Nevertheless , cabinets covered in high-density laminates are sturdy and easy to keep clean . Special storage features Cabinets these days offer some impressive storage features , which can really improve efficiency and convenience , especially in cramped kitchens . They include revolving can racks in pantry cabinets , Lazy Susans with recycling bins , spice racks , pullout base trays and more .
