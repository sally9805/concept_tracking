Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS Lobbyists , entrenched forces in Congress and self-interested friends will try to stymie Clinton 's efforts . A look at four key arenas of combat : <p> THE MEDICAL LOBBY LINEUP <p> Memo to incoming White House junior staff : volunteers required for taking on an interest group . Immediate , sweeping reform is the goal . The group ? Oh , it 's more than twice the size of the military-industrial complex . And a lot better dug in . <p> The target is the health business . When dark horse Harris Wofford won election to the Senate in 1991 promising top-to-bottom reform of health care , other politicians took notice . By 1992 nearly all candidates for office , including Bill Clinton and George Bush , were advocating action regarding what many now call the health-industrial complex . Everybody wants something done . How strongly can the health system resist change ? <p> Very strongly , if dollars are any measure . In the year 1973 an important line was crossed-health care became more expensive than defense . Since then military spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This year the Pentagon will consume about 6 percent of the GNP , while health costs will gobble up 13 percent . " Defense and medicine have become the same , " says Richard Smith , public-policy director of the Washington Business Group on Health . " The people wear uniforms , technology is in the driver 's seat , and both cost far too much . " <p> Americans receive good health care by many measures , but judged by cost effectiveness the U.S. system may be the worst in the world . The United States spends more per capita on health than any nation , yet is the sole Western country in which medical expenses do n't buy universal coverage for all citizens . <p> Clinton has said that health reform will be a priority of his administration . But imagine tackling a system with more than double the entrenched lobbying clout of the Pentagon . " Only all-out reform has a chance , " asserts Rep. Jim Cooper , a Tennessee Democrat . " Health-care special interests have enough power to block tinkering . We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad program that changes everything . " <p> Countries like France and Denmark that offer high-quality universal coverage at lower cost than the United States are able to do so partly because their governments took on the health lobby years ago , when its economic dimensions were smaller . With each year doctors , hospitals and insurers control more dollars , acquiring greater lobbying leverage . This suggests that that delay in " all out " reform will only make the problem worse , as medicine 's share of the GNP keeps growing . The medical-lobby lineup : <p> Doctors . Physicians are among the wealthiest segments of society , each averaging $164,300 in income in 1990 . They spend freely to influence government decisions , with the American Medical Association always one of the top PAC donors . <p> In recent years an increasing number of doctors have come to favor some program to aid the " medically indigent , " the estimated 35 million Americans with no health insurance . Doctors favor the idea for two reasons : one altruistic , because universal care is a moral imperative ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richer . <p> Thirty years ago nearly all physician groups lobbied against Medicare ; later , realizing Medicare allowed them to raise prices , doctors embraced it warmly . A similar progression of attitudes now applies to the medically indigent . Increasingly doctors realize that with a new government-or employer-financed universal-care program , they could charge for services now rendered on a charity basis . <p> A working estimate is that universal care would increase U.S. medical costs $50 billion a year , wiping out the peace dividend in a single stroke . Health-care advocates therefore assume that new cost controls must accompany universal care . But most physician lobbies want only new payments , not accompanying controls . In California , the state AMA affiliate is furiously resisting a proposal that combines universal coverage with cost containment . <p> The docs ' lobby has long suffered from sleeplessness and other chronic symptoms , worrying that the public will realize that physician wealth is unique to the United States . In what used to be West Germany , which has top-quality medical care , doctors earn about 25 percent less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps by cuts in federal reimbursements , would save about $45 billion a year , enough to finance universal care and still leave doctors very well off . Is this possible ? " The political system has shown so little courage on physicians ' incomes that the best most of us hope for is stopping future growth , " says Rashi Fein , an economist at Harvard Medical School . <p> Hospitals . The U.S. hospital industry , at $256 billion in 1990 , is nearly the size of the Pentagon . Those who have crossed paths with hospital accounts offices know that when it comes to money , many hospitals are now tougher than Schwarzkopf Their lobbying can be as aggressive . <p> Hospitals will support new benefits for the uninsured , both because it 's the right thing to do and because it will create payments for care that hospitals now give away . But like most doctors , most hospitals oppose combining new benefits with new controls . Clinton advisers have spoken of " global budgets " for hospitals . Under this plan , hospitals would receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each patient treated : the idea is to break the pass-along mentality . Hospital lobbyists are expected to fight to the death against this notion , since health " providers " love to pass costs along . <p> One political problem that may cut into hospital-lobby clout : avarice at the top . The New York Times recently reported that while medical prices ran 114 percent ahead of inflation in the last decade , pay for hospital executives escalated at 142 percent . Paul Marks , CEO of New York 's nonprofit Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center , makes well over $1 million a year ; H. Richard Nesson , head of nonprofit Brigham &; Women 's Hospital in Boston , made $872,000 in 1991 . Marks and Nesson thus earn much more than the amount that got William Aramony in hot water as head of the United Way . And since the primary source of revenue to hospitals is government , hospital CEOs are annexing their opulence from the taxpayer , whereas Aramony 's pay came entirely from donations . <p> Insurers . Advocates of government-financed systems like those of Western Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payer " plan . This soothing , neutral term plays better than " socialized medicine "  --  except with insurance companies . If government were the " single payer , " medical insurers would be out of business . <p> No national health-care system could be adapted without shutting down part of the insurance industry . But just as society may be better off with some resources diverted from defense contractors to domestic needs , the health-care system might be better off with fewer workers involved in unproductive paper-shuffling of insurance claims . America spends as much as a breathtaking $130 billion per year on health overhead , enough to fund universal care and cut medical costs simultaneously . <p> Clinton seems likely to propose reforms under the buzzphrase " managed competition . " One idea should be government-set basic health-insurance terms , so that buyers can make meaningful comparisons between plans . Another should be a ban on " adverse risk selection , " under which insurers bar coverage for preexisting conditions or drop policyholders who become gravely ill . <p> Such standards would violate one of the great sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobbyists have beaten back every attempt at nationwide standards , preferring to work the 50 statehouses on a divide-and-conquer strategy . Federal health-insurance rules would open the door to federal scrutiny of auto , life and property insurance : longstanding goals of consumer advocates . Expect many , many millions of dollars of your premiums to be spent resisting this development . <p> The Wofford Factor . How will Congress respond to health-industry lobbying ? One hopeful note is the Wofford Factor . Incumbents left Capitol Hill in huge numbers this fall , replaced by candidates who ran on issues like health-care reform . Last year 's old-boy Congress , which retreated in terror before the health lobby many times , might have been too timorous to attempt substantial reform . This year 's group may have the combination of courage and foolishness necessary for the task . If so , the greatest change in health care since the 1965 creation of Medicare may be in store . <p> GREGG EASTERBROOK <p> <p> Medical Cares <p> The medical-industrial complex is the most powerful interest of all : KEY PROJECTS Push : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperative .

KEY PLAYERS American Medical Assoc . Pharm . Manufacturers Assoc . American Hospitals Assoc . Health Insurance Assoc. of Am . <p> ' IRON TRIANGLE ' VETERANS <p> George Bush whittled from the Pentagon budget in each of his four years as president . Bill Clinton , eager to avoid being painted as another soft-on-defense Democrat , stayed quietly on Bush 's heels during the fall campaign . What little he had to say about defense policy heavily overlapped Bush 's message . His proposed five-year , $1.3 trillion Pentagon budget is only 5 percent smaller than Bush 's . While Clinton proposed deeper troop cuts in Europe and a new commitment to retraining laid-off defense workers for the civilian job sector , both men offered essentially the same pared-down vision of the post-cold-war military . <p> The truth is that both plans merely nibble at the edges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new domestic agenda and fashion a smaller but highly mobile military for 21st-century threats , Clinton will have to make far deeper cuts . That means fighting the military 's " Iron Triangle , " the cozy alliance of the Pentagon , its contractors and their friends on Capitol Hill . They 're all dug in like battle-hardened infantry : <p> Congress . The defense industry may be hurting , but its political-action committees still ponied up $4.4 million for congressional campaigns in 1992 . The money is bound to help certain weapons projects survive . Even some of Clinton 's closest supporters are committed to programs that should be killed . Sen. Sam Nunn backs the $37 billion Protection Against Limited Strikes system ( PALS ) , a poor-mails Strategic Defense Initiative designed to destroy incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) . But PALS wo n't be ready in time to deal with the only significant security threat the country faces : the residual arsenal of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union . It would be far cheaper to buy the missiles . Ukraine is asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it inherited . <p> The pork barrel will bedevil many proposed reductions . Sen. Strom Thurmond offers a case in point . The ancient South Carolinian has been entitled to the top Republican slot on the Senate Armed Services Committee for years , but yielded it to Sen. John Warner so he could concentrate on other assignments . Thurmond recently said he is now claiming the seat to defend South Carolina from impending cutbacks . The state has 11 military installations , including the complex of air , naval and Marine bases around Charleston , generating $3.6 billion a year in wages and state contracts . And Thurmond certainly wo n't be the only member of Congress circling the pork wagons . Pressure will come from other levels of government as well . The Bush administration proposes cutting reserves from their 1987 peak of 1.1 million to 925,000 by 1997 . Even this modest decrease has stalled in Congress because of pressure from the nations governors . In many states , reserve pay is a key source of supplemental family income . Clinton is sure to hear from his ex-colleagues if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Factor . A rubric for various lobbies close to the heart of the Democratic Party . Their two biggest military objectives : repealing the ban on gays and allowing women into combat . Clinton risks squandering political capital in Congress and the Pentagon if he is pushed to move too hard too soon on these questions . The debates wo n't go away . A presidential commission recently recommended allowing women on some naval warships , but rejected them for infantry and air combat . Clinton bought himself some time by kicking the gay issue over to a yet-to-be-appointed study group . Sooner or later , though , he 'll be forced to deliver . <p> The Military Mind-Set . Armies invariably learn more from defeat than they do from victory . Desert Storm is no exception . While the gulf war stands as an impressive technical triumph , the performance of individual services and weapons systems tells a far more ambiguous story . In a world where mobility will be the key to future military success , it took the army six months to move two corps to Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a clear-eyed look at the changes it must make . To force those reforms , he 'll need a defense secretary capable of nothing less than what James Forrestal did when he shaped the military 's cold-war missions in the late 1940s . Despite the many milestones since  --  including the reductions of the Bush-Powell era  --  Forrestal 's architecture , designed for a single , now nonexistent Soviet foe , remains largely in place . <p> Colin Powell . It 's difficult to overstate his influence . He 's the most powerful man of the Joint Chiefs since George Marshall  --  perhaps too powerful for Clinton 's long-term political health . The Bush administration 's proposal for shrinking uniformed forces from 1.9 million to 1.6 million by 1997 is Powell 's brainchild . Earlier this year he insisted that any further reductions would jeopardize national security . But he 's softened his stance recently , acknowledging Clinton 's proposal for deeper cuts  --  to 1.4 million by 1997 . The truth is that both Clinton and the Joint Chiefs will have to face the prospect of more radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up money for domestic programs . <p> The big showdown is likely to come over any attempt by the newcomers to radically alter the missions of the individual service branches to reflect new budgetary and strategic realities . Powell is likely to resist . He 's working on his own reappraisal of service missions , and sources say it proposes minimal changes . " That 's Colin , " said a senior colleague . " He 's very pro-army and he 's very conservative . " Powell 's term as chairman is up in September . Clinton might want to ease him into a high-level cabinet job . Or the new president may decide that Powell is a power-that-be that he can be without . <p> JOHN BARRY <p> <p> Defense Maneuvers <p> Seismic changes coming . Services will compete for scarce dollars and try to thwart social reform . Push : C-17 cargo transport ( despite design problems ) , F-22 fighter , increased role in drug interdiction . Block : Lifting military ban on gays ( top priority ) , base closures , troop withdrawals . KEY PLAYERS Sen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assoc . <p> DOING BUSINESS WITH BUSINESS <p> The business lobbies in Washington are awaiting Bill Clinton with roses in one hand-and a war club tucked behind the back in the other . Business , like everyone else , wants to start off right with any new president . Hence the roses . And though he 's a Democrat , Clinton is admired by most business groups for his fix-the-economy-first campaign and for his record of consultation and compromise with business as governor of Arkansas . " This is not Mr. Dukakis coming in , " says William Archey , the No. 2 man at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . " This is not a Democrat who is knee-jerk adversarial to business . " <p> But there 's still the war club . During the campaign , Clinton made dozens of social , legal , tax and labor proposals that industry deplores . These include proposals to cap executive pay , raise taxes on the rich , bar the permanent hiring of strikebreakers in labor disputes , restore the closed shop in union contracts and require every business to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Business claims that these proposals would erode efficiency or ruinously raise costs . Some lobbies will concede certain issues to Clinton . " Family leave and the rich man 's tax are going to pass the new Congress in 20 minutes anyway , " says Jack Albertine , a Washington lobbyist , so " why waste your ammo on a lost cause ? " But the National Federation of Independent Business , a grass-roots giant with more than 600,000 members , is conceding nothing . " We 're going to take it issue by issue , " says John Motley , director of federal relations for the NFIB . " We 'll support Clinton where we can , but we will fight him when we must . " <p> Yet as Clinton starts out , nearly all business lobbies-even the NFIB-are upbeat . The president-elect indicated that he will focus his first 100-day policies on improving economic growth , in part by pushing a temporary investment tax credit , while simultaneously attacking the long-term deficit in the budget . These are the top priorities of business , too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chairman of both B.F. Goodrich and the Business Roundtable , the country 's big-business lobby . The manufacturing sector looks to Clinton 's presidency with outright hope . The president-elect vowed to use government to rebuild the U.S. manufacturing base , notes Jerry Jasinowski , president of the National Association of Manufacturers . Jasinowski has been dickering with Clinton aides since early October . " The Clinton administration is going to be quite open to business suggestions . It 'll do anything reasonable to boost jobs , productivity and growth , " predicts Jasinowski . <p> The high-tech-electronics industry is even happier . Clinton met last summer with Silicon Valley executives , led by John Young of Hewlett-Packard and Roger Johnson of Western Digital , and crafted a subsidy program . He promised to make the 20 percent research-and-development tax credit permanent ( worth $1 billion ) , to establish a high-tech civilian research-and-development agency ( $5 billion to $10 billion ) and to build a new telecommunications " interstate highway " hooking up all civilian research and educational library computer databases nationwide ( $1 billion to $5 billion ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state all by ourselves , " says Johnson . " Bill Clinton has a program to get this country moving . " <p> Some industries are directly in Clinton 's line of policy fire-and they 're openly grousing . Charles DiBona of the American Petroleum Institute notes that Clinton pledged to prohibit production in all big potential oilfields under U.S. control ( the Arctic National Wildlife area , offshore California ) . Clinton also said that he would cut back U.S. oil consumption by 2 million barrels a day by the year 2000 to curb the greenhouse effect . " The domestic oil industry has lost 450,000 jobs in the last decade-72,000 last year alone , " DiBona says . " Clinton means more trouble-and worse . " And Clinton vowed to boost the corporate average fuel economy ( CAFE ) standard from 27.5 miles per gallon to 40 miles per gallon by the year 2000 . U.S. automakers , struggling through their third year of red ink , claim they lack the know-how and the cash to meet that goal . What to do ? Pray . Mike Stanton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , was heartened by Clintons remarks during a campaign stop in Michigan in early October . When challenged on the new CAFE standard , Clinton " said that he did n't want to do anything that would cost jobs , " says Stanton . " We find that encouraging . " <p> If  --  and when  --  it comes to a fight with Clinton , the business lobbies are already preparing their strategy : grass roots , grass roots and more grass roots . William Archey of the chamber notes that there will be 110 new lawmakers in the House next year and that domestic policy dominates voter concern , to the total exclusion of foreign policy , more than at any time since 1936 . " National security-a president 's showcase  --  is n't even in the top 10 issues , " says Archey . " This means power shifts to the Congress , where members will vote the views of the folks back home . " The chamber and the NFIB have elaborate newsletter and wire communications with their members . The nets include computerized telecommunications systems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders-within hours if necessary-to every member of Congress on Capitol Hill . <p> This kind of muscle does n't guarantee business victories : congressional Democrats thwarted business interests in numerous votes last year . But the NFIB 's Motley has done his congressional nose count for next year and says that he 's encouraged . He figures that he can count on 165 of the 176 Republicans in the House , as well as an additional 30 conservative Democrats . " This leaves me with one to two dozen votes to scramble up elsewhere when we 're really sweating a vote , " says Motley . " That should be doable on a lot of issues . " Motley hopes that it wo n't come to that too often . Despite Clinton 's promises to liberals during the campaign , he 's the only current governor ever to have won an NFIB plaque as a " Guardian of Small Business "  --  one of the NFIB 's highest awards . <p> RICH THOMAS <p> <p> Industry Agenda <p> Business interests will fight hard to protect and expand their tax breaks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax cut for new businesses ; a new R &D; agency ; new subsidies for high-tech projects ; overall deficit reduction .

Business Conference Business Rountable Nat'l Assoc. of Manufacturers <p> WITH FRIENDS LIKE THESE <p> Saying no to your friends is hard . But if Bill Clinton is truly " a different kind of Democrat , " he will disappoint his liberal allies . They know that . In a rare moment of mutual understanding , liberal interest groups are lying back , respecting Clinton 's difficult balancing act , and not putting the squeeze on him . At least not yet . Sobered by 12 years out of power , these groups have less of a sense of political entitlement . They know how fragile their hold on power is with a president who won because he moved the Democratic Party to the middle . But self-restraint is not a popular virtue among activists of any kind . And the betting is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . <p> How hard they push for their pet programs and how Clinton handles the onslaught will be a central theme of his presidency . What could save Clinton is the memory of Jimmy Carter being overwhelmed by the demands from his own party . " For those of us who remember , that tempers our sense of expectation , " says former Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt , a contender for a top environmental post . A Carter health-care proposal and legislation curbing hospital costs failed mostly because they were n't far-reaching enough to please Sen. Ted Kennedy and an array of interest groups . The chance to draft more politically correct bills ended with the election of Ronald Reagan . Clinton 's transition chief , Vernon Jordan , was among Carter 's earliest critics . Then head of the Urban League and a longtime Carter friend , Jordan hurt the new president 's credibility by charging that he had not fulfilled promises made to the civil-rights community . <p> This time , interest groups are packaging their demands differently . They are avoiding big price tags and tailoring their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some key areas : <p> Education . Teachers are among the Democratic Party 's biggest financial backers and voting blocs . They want Clinton to be the " Education President " that Bush never was and fully fund Head Start , rebuild inner-city schools and turn high schools into technology centers . Clinton supports these goals , but not all at once . The 2 million-member National Education Association is a major player in presidential politics . This year the group gave the Clinton campaign more than $1 million . In 1984 , the NEA presented Democratic nominee Walter Mondale with a list of programs that added up to $11 billion . Mondale 's eager acquiescence tagged him as a tool of the special interests and another tax-and-spend Democrat , labels the party is still trying to shake . This time , the NEA 's proposals are more modest . " We do n't have a lock on anything , " says NEA president Keith Geiger . The union may have downsized its dollar expectations . But it still poses trouble for Clinton on philosophical grounds . The NEA opposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way for college students to repay federal student loans-programs at the heart of Clinton 's reform agenda . <p> Environment . The Green Group , a coalition of environmental organizations , recently broadened its franchise to include population-control advocates and the Children 's Defense Fund , where Hillary Clinton is a board member . " If it is narrowly defined as just birds and bees , nobody is going to play , " says Jay Hair , head of the National Wildlife Federation . Environmentalists , who have a strong ally in Al Gore , are biding their time to let Clinton build political capital with Congress and the voters . For now , they are asking for things that do n't cost money : elevating the Environmental Protection Agency to cabinet level ; lifting anti-abortion controls on international family-planning programs ; convening a summit on the spotted owl controversy in the Northwest . " We do n't want to ruin what could be a good relationship any sooner than we have to , " says Jim Maddy of the League of Conservation Voters . Environmental concerns have never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental cleanup as an industry of the future . <p> Women . Clinton promised repeatedly in his campaign to include women in equal numbers in his administration . To help him keep that pledge at all levels , women 's groups are sending long lists of names to the Little Rock transition office . This week the National Political Congress of Black Women will unveil its list to make sure African-American women are represented . Pro-choice groups would like Clinton to press for Freedom of Choice legislation , but he does not want a contentious battle over abortion rights to divert him from his economic agenda . Instead , Clinton is expected to sign executive orders immediately that lift the ban on abortion counseling in federally funded clinics , allow fetal-tissue testing and ease import restrictions on RU-486 , the French abortion pill . <p> Cities . In traditional political terms , Clinton " owes " very little to big-city mayors . His campaign was pitched toward white suburban voters , who are now a voting majority . During the campaign , a $35 billion package to revive the cities was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Clinton 's emphasis on job training and public investment in rebuilding the nation 's crumbling infrastructure . The Rev. Jesse Jackson , who traveled tirelessly to register new voters for Clinton , wants early White House leadership on statehood for the District of Columbia , <p> Clinton 's best defense is to keep a relentless focus on his economic agenda . And the interest groups understand that : cramming bits and pieces of their agenda into an omnibus economic package will occupy them for the coming weeks and months . But once at the table , will they be able to take no for an answer ? Clinton will also face strong opposition from senior citizens ' groups to any kind of deficit-reduction package that includes restraints on entitlements . Many organizations have flourished over the last decade because they had a clear enemy in the White House , but pillorying enemies is a lot easier than promoting patience . If Clinton is to prevail , he must reverse the natural order . <p> ELEANOR CLIFT <p> <p> Liberal Interests <p> Clinton wo n't play Santa , so liberals will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Choice Act , RU-486 approval , fully funded Head Start , inner-city school rebuilding , environmental regulation , NAFTA revisions , striker protection , campaign-finance reform .
