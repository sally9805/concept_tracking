<p> The authors of a controversial new book argue that brains determine success . And some people - and races-are simply smarter than other . <p> Among the ideas that have harmed mankind , one of the most durable and destructive is that the human species is divided into biological units called races and that some races are innately superior to others . <p> At the moment this notion is being resurrected yet again , in a new and seemingly objective guise , by several prominent social scientists . <p> Their argument goes like this . Blacks perform more poorly on IQ tests then whites , so they must be less intelligent . The IQ scores of children correlate with those of their parents , so intelligence must be at least partly governed by genes . Therefore , the IQ difference between blacks and whites has a genetic component that can not be eliminated by society . <p> A highly sophisticated version of this reasoning can be found in an incendiary new book called " The Bell Curve " by Charles Murray , a fellow of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of psychology at Harvard who died of cancer last month . <p> The topic of racial differences in intelligence today is like the topic of sex in Victorian England , the authors submit . Among friends - in the office , locker room and dormitory - people say things that would be considered racist if uttered in a public forum . <p> " As the gulf widens between public discussion and private opinion , " they write , " confusion and error flourish . " <p> What the authors fail to mention is that it is social scientists such as themselves who have been responsible for much of the " confusion and error . " <p> Psychometry - the measurement of mental faculties like intelligence - has a long and farcical history , one driven by irrational convictions about racial superiority . <p> Among its discoveries over the last century and a half are that Jews are not really very smart , that Mediterranean peoples are genetically inferior to Nordic ones and that the average mental age of white U.S. enlistees in World War I was 13 . <p> That such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , mean that the conclusions like those in " The Bell Curve " should be dismissed out of hand , for genuine science sometimes sprouts from the manure of pseudoscience and quackery . But it does suggest that we should be extremely skeptical of claims that whites are on average smarter than blacks , that Japanese and Chinese are smarter than whites and that these differences are writ immutably in our genes . <p> It also suggests that we should take a look at what the natural sciences - biology and genetics , as against the more dubious field of psychometry - have to say about racial differences . <p> And here is what we learn when we do . First , the human species most likely arose only 100,000 years or so ago - the day before yesterday in evolutionary time . That means that any differences among the races must have emerged since then . <p> Superficial adaptations like skin color can evolve very quickly , in a matter of several thousand years . Changes in brain structure and capacity take far longer - on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no evidence for such changes since Homo sapiens first appeared on the fossil record . Innate differences in intelligence among the races have simply not had enough time to evolve . <p> Second , genetic diversity among the races is minuscule . Molecular biologists can now examine genes in different geographical populations . What they have found is that the overwhelming majority of the variation observed - more than 85 percent - is among individuals within the same race . Only a tiny residue distinguishes Europeans from Africans from Asians . <p> This means that Patrick Buchanan has more in common genetically with many Xhosas and Outer Mongolians than he does with , say , Prince Charles . <p> Murray and Herrnstein respond by insisting that " some ethnic groups nonetheless differ genetically for sure , otherwise they would not have differing skin colors or hair textures . . . . The question remaining is whether the intellectual differences overlap the genetic differences to any extent . " <p> But with hundreds of human genes now mapped , it has become apparent that patterns of variation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent of those in other genetically determined traits . Biologically speaking , a person 's color reveals very little indeed about what 's beneath his skin . <p> So , while all men may not be created equal when it comes to cognitive abilities , it would seem that all races are . How then do we account for the sizable gap in measured IQ - about 15 points on average - that seems to separate American blacks and whites ? <p> Murray and Herrnstein are adept at rebutting many of the conventional explanations for the discrepancy - that IQ tests are culturally biased , that poverty and racism alone are to blame . They and many fellow researchers have gone to heroic lengths to disentangle nature from nurture , striving to show that environmental factors explain only a small part of the racial gap . <p> But they have not gone far enough . Perhaps that is owing to their rather naive understanding of the relation between genes and the physical embodiment of IQ , the brain . <p> Genes encode only a sketchy blueprint of our cortical hardware . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , have somewhat dissimilar brains at birth - a consequence of the different patterns of stimulation they were exposed to in the womb , which give rise to different neuronal connections . <p> The importance of this prenatal " hard-wiring " for a child 's future intellectual prospects is only beginning to be appreciated . What is amply known , though , is that African-Americans are enormously disadvantaged when it comes to the quality of prenatal care they receive ; a black mother is three times as likely as a one - that , to the social scientist , looks like a matter of genetics . <p> Of all the interracial comparisons of intelligence that have been made over the years , only one effectively controlled for differences in pre-and postnatal care . That was a 1961 study of the out-of-wedlock offspring of black and of white U.S. soldiers and German mothers during the Allied occupation . The very small IQ difference observed actually favored the black children . <p> Put this together with adoption studies showing that an early move from a deprived home to an advantaged one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the conviction expressed in " The Bell Curve " that public policy is impotent to redress IQ inequalities begins to betray a lack of imagination , if not will . <p> Are racial differences in intelligence natural , innate and unchangeable , as some social scientists like to believe ? <p> Or can such differences be made to shrink and ultimately disappear with a better understanding of how the early environment determines the formation of our cognitive apparatus , as the conclusions of natural scientists seem to indicate ? <p> I am putting my money on the natural scientists . After all , at least one occupational study has shown that they have the higher IQs .
