Over a period of almost four hundred years transatlantic slavery changed the history of four continents-Africa , North and South America , and Europe . From the end of the sixteenth century until late in the nineteenth , European merchants transported millions of Africans across the Atlantic to work as slaves in the Americas . The system of transatlantic slavery is often known as the triangular trade . On the first leg , ships from Spain , Portugal , England , the Netherlands , France , and Scandinavia set sail for the west coast of Africa carrying a wide variety of goods , which were exchanged for captives . The second part of the trip , the infamous " middle passage , " took the enslaved Africans across the Atlantic under conditions of great deprivation . Those who survived were sold and put to work . The vast majority led a life of hard labor that ended in death far from home . The third stage of the triangle brought the slave ships back to Europe with credit notes or with cargoes of sugar , molasses , cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade took place directly between the Americas and Africa , especially in the nineteenth century . There were many voyages between Brazil and Angola , and a number of American ships , which had always been involved in the slave trade in a small way , ran an illegal trade . Many of these vessels were whalers seeking an opportunity for a quick profit . The lax controls in the United States also meant that a number of Spanish ships adopted the American flag to continue their illegal trade during this period . Transatlantic slavery originated in the sixteenth century , in the decades following Columbus 's landfall , when the Spanish and Portuguese began their conquest of the Americas . Their initial interest was the gold and silver objects found in Central and South America in such abundance . The funerary mask shown in Plate VI , for example , is in fact made of an alloy of gold and copper . It was originally painted red , of which only vestiges remain around the nose , and was produced by people of the Sican culture in Peru between about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melted down to be sent back to Europe as bullion .

Africans had visited and traded with Europe for centuries , but Europeans knew little about Africa . The situation changed in the fifteenth century , when improved ships and navigational instruments allowed the Portuguese to establish trading stations along the coast of West Africa . The French , English , Dutch , Danish , and Spanish later followed suit . Again , gold was one of the principal attractions for the Europeans . It was a central feature of the Ashanti culture ( in what is Ghana today ) , and gold dust was used in trading . Spectacular objects were cast by the lost-wax technique , including rings , pendants , and bracelets . The pectoral disk shown in Plate I is a fine example of Ashanti work with its elaborate repousse decoration of stylized leaves . Such disks were worn by young male servants of the Ashanti kings .

In the kingdom of Benin ( see Fig. 3 ) , which once included the lands along the Gulf of Guinea , mainly present-day Nigeria , skilled craftsmen were casting brass to create some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among them is the plaque shown in Plate V , one of a number made during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that were hung on pillars in the palace of the oba , the ruler of the kingdom of Benin . This one shows a Bini warrior in his chain-mail armor and helmet , holding a spear and shield . The Bini were the oba 's bodyguards . Beside him are two smaller scale figures with pipes and a gong , a reminder of the importance of music in West African societies . What is perhaps more surprising is the inclusion of two Portuguese soldiers on either side of the warrior 's head , each holding a manilla-a horseshoe-shaped copper or brass arm bracelet worn by Africans . These manillas were one of the main items traded for slaves . The Benin plaques have an infamous history . They were seized by a raiding party when the British navy undertook a punitive raid on Benin in 1897 . The vast majority were acquired by the British Museum in London , but many European museums were offered examples . About nine hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into American museums , including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City . As slave ships moved along the African coast , the captains engaged in prolonged bartering for their cargo . They generally brought a range of goods to trade , the most popular usually being manufactured objects with practical applications such as guns , ammunition , copper and iron goods , and textiles . Items such as cowrie shells and manillas were used as currency Some were decorative items like the colored glass beads shown in Plate VII , which originated in Italy and other parts of the Continent and were imported into Liverpool and other slavers ' ports . The examples shown here were found in Ghana . The impact of the European arrival in West Africa is evident not only in the devastating effect on the indigenous societies but also in some of the objects produced there .

The European merchants who organized the slave trade were often prosperous and respected members of their communities . In Liverpool , which dominated the trade from about 1740 until its abolition , nearly every mayor and many of the town 's councilors and leading citizens were involved . One of the most active was William Davenport ( 1725-1797 ) , who invested in some 120 voyages over a forty-year period . He was a principal shareholder in a ship named the Dobson , which is illustrated on the bowl made to celebrate her launching in 1770 ( Fig. 1 ) . Such bowls were among the most popular forms made by the very successful tin-glazed earthenware industry in Liverpool . Their precise use is not known , but they may have been intended for drinking a toast to launch the ship as well as to commemorate the event . They comprise an important visual record of ships of the time . Life on board the slave ships was unpleasant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hold was foul ; disease and sickness were common because of the oppressive heat and rudimentary sanitation . Before the mid-eighteenth century , one in five slaves died en route , and most of the rest arrived malnourished and weak . Women and children were allowed some freedom of movement , but the men were secured by wrought-iron leg shackles ( see   . II ) . The quantities of chains and shackles required to sustain the trade were enormous , and in 1807 , a sale of " Valuable Articles for the Slave Trade " included three tons of " hand and feet shackles and thumb screws . " Examples were put on display , " except the thumb screws , the sight of which it is thought would too deeply wound the feelings of those not inclined to purchase . " 1 Once in the Americas , life was equally harsh for the enslaved . Work on the sugar plantations of the Caribbean islands was backbreaking , as recorded by William Clark in a series of ten views made during his visit to Antigua in the 1820s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in the field is a reminder that there was little distinction between the sexes in terms of the work they were expected to do . Other plates in the series show the other steps in sugar cultivation , including planting , hoeing , boiling the canes , and shipping the barrels . Large numbers of slaves worked in mines in the towns , and in a variety of specialized occupations , such as joinery , metalworking , gunsmithing , coopering , and even as seamen . Beginning in the late eighteenth century some women were brought in from the fields to do domestic J work , such as cooking , housekeeping , and nursing and taking care of the children . Whatever they did , the slaves faced oppression , brutality and bondage . It is not surprising that many fought back by rebelling , working slowly , or running away . The runaways sometimes established quite large communities , often in swamps or mountainous regions out of the reach of their owners . These fugitives were known as Maroons , and one of the largest such settlements was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced many of their own utensils and everyday objects , which were very often decorative as well as useful . A splendid example is the nineteenth-century stool shown in Plate XI , which was the work of the Saramaccer tribe from the Ganya Condree Valley of the upper Suriname River in Dutch Guiana . Although the designs are reminiscent of African carving , they developed independently of African tradition and styles . Once the slave ships had discharged their human cargo they loaded mainly raw materials for their return to Europe . In addition to sugar , tobacco , rice , molasses , and , beginning in the late eighteenth century , cotton , the cargoes included pepper , ginger , and other spices , dye woods , and timber . The most fashionable wood for furniture making in eighteenth-century England was mahogany , originally known as Jamaica wood , since the island of Jamaica was one of its main sources . It was also used for paneling , doors , and other interior applications . Photograph Pl . VIII . Detail of Cutting Sugar Cane from William Clark , Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No. 3 .

The business of slavery provided an enormous stimulus for industrialization and capitalism . This , of course , continued after the abolition of the slave trade itself as merchants continued to profit from the materials produced on plantations reliant on slaves . Most Africans were taken to the Americas , but a significant , if small , number were found in Europe . Captains and other officers on slave ships were often partially rewarded by being given one or two Africans to sell for r themselves , and some of these were brought back to the seamen 's home ports .

The main reason for this was that it was fashionable among aristocrats and other wealthy people to have a black servant in their households . The painting of Sir William Young and his family in Plate III represents a case in point . Young owned large plantations in the West Indies and held various official appointments there , but spent most of his time in England . In the painting , while Young plays the cello his liveried black servant helps one of Young 's sons dismount from his horse . Photograph Pl .

Merseyside Maritime Museum . // By the latter part of the eighteenth century many voices were being raised against slavery , not least among the enslaved themselves . This resistance is most emphatically celebrated in the carved figure of an African breaking his chains shown in Plate IX . This life-sized figure was probably produced in the United States during the late nineteenth century . It is similar to other carved wooden figures in the folk art tradition , but its precise provenance is unknown . The scale of resistance and in particular the frequency and disruption caused by slave revolts caused people to question the feasibility and profitability of slavery . In England in the late eighteenth century William Wilberforce ( 17591833 ) , Thomas Clarkson ( 176-1846 ) , and other abolitionists moved against slavery on humanitarian and religious grounds . After the abolition of the trade itself , they campaigned for the emancipation of the slaves in British colonies . This took place in 1834 with the proviso that all former slaves be indentured as apprentices for seven years , which was later cut to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the British West Indies were freed , most had been indentured for four years . A range of objects was produced to support the emancipation movement : badges , coins , tokens , ceramic figures , and medallions . These were particularly prevalent during the 1820s and are typified by the pair of Staffordshire figure groups shown in Plate XII , which represent Slavery and Emancipation . The freed slave stands before the figure of Britannia . The message is rather simplistic and ignores the contribution that blacks made to their own freedom . The white earthenware plate in Figure 2 celebrates the first day of actual freedom for the slaves in the British West Indies-August 1 , 1838 . It was then that celebrations were held . The road to freedom was not easily achieved , and there were many who fought vigorously in defense of slavery , particularly in Liverpool where merchants and investors were profiting from it One such advocate of the trade was James Penny a prominent merchant who regularly sent vessels to West Africa and Angola .

" 2 Four years later Penny was presented with the elaborate silver-plated epergne shown in Plate X. Its large size and considerable value say much about the attitude of the local civic leaders . The legacy of the slave trade and transatlantic slavery is enormous in human , social , and economic terms , although there is much disagreement about the consequences . Whatever one 's view , the physical reminders are all around us , and many innocuous objects can be linked to this " Evil and Wicked Traffic . " 3 Photograph Pl . X.
