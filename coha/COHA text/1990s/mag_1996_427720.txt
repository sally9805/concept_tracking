Section : Family album A chance online trip could unearth kin you did n't know you had <p> One night last summer when Margie Newton was surfing the Internet , she came across Switchboard http : //www.switchboard.com , an online directory that holds the telephone numbers and addresses of 106 million U.S. residents . On a whim , Newton typed in " Schouten , " her maiden name . The screen filled with Schoutens , 84 in all . " I wondered if we were related , " says the Concord , Calif. , resident . Not knowing whom to ask  --  her parents never talked much about their families  --  Newton embarked on a genealogical journey in cyberspace . <p> Tapping electronic discussion groups and Web sites devoted to genealogy and benefiting from the kindness of strangers who visited far-off archives and reported back to her , Newton is methodically filling in the branches of both of her family trees . She exchanges E-mail with newfound cousins who provide advice and help identify her ancestors . Newton 's biggest breakthrough was hooking up with a second cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian and that her maternal grandmother had six siblings . They met face to face in October , sharing old photographs and exchanging lore . " It 's the nicest thing that has happened to me all year , " says Newton . <p> It may seem ironic that the Internet , that vast and anonymous set of wires , modems and computers , spurs people 's curiosity about their ancestors . But it is precisely the Internet 's ability to bring the world to a desktop that is revolutionizing genealogical research by making it faster , cheaper and more efficient than ever before . It has linked archives , libraries , historical and genealogical societies and hundreds of genealogists , both amateur and professional , around the country , many of them putting what they know on the Web . " It has opened up the world and made genealogy accessible to more people , " says Curt Witcher , manager of the Historical Genealogy Department at the Allen County Public Library in Fort Wayne , Ind . And even more people  --  cybernauts and the Web-shy alike  --  are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10-part series Ancestors debuts on PBS in January . Each half-hour episode tells of a family search , like that of the woman who documents deadly cancers back several generations , followed by a how-to segment . <p> The Internet 's global reach has brought the family tree to life as netizens far and wide are locating living relatives , some of whom they never even knew existed . Earlier this year , Joyce Wilson of Prescott , Ariz. , came across her husband 's grandmother 's maiden name on the RootsWeb Genealogical Data Cooperative page http : //www.rootsweb.com , which includes a list of thousands of surnames being researched by genealogists . She E-mailed a question , and by the next morning the woman who had posted the name , a descendant of her husband 's grandmother 's sister , answered with a 12-page list of relatives . Wilson 's husband , who thought he and his brothers were the extent of the clan , now has a slew of newly discovered cousins . The couple met many of them last summer during a trip to Ohio and Pennsylvania . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make finding ancestors much easier . Ivan Brian Sexton of Roanoke , Va. , hit a rich lode of archives when he found a distant cousin , Dianne Peterson , via the Internet . Peterson , who lives in Marion , Ohio , had already been researching the Sexton family line for about four years and had been in contact with other Sexton family researchers . " I was amazed at how many people were doing that line , " says Sexton , who recently met Peterson . Now Peterson coaches her cousin in genealogy ; they E-mail their findings to each other . <p> The long-lost cousins owe their meeting to the most ambitious genealogical project on the Net . The USGenWeb project http : //www.usgenweb.com , which debuted on the Internet in April , is a volunteer effort to organize and add to the genealogical data available online . Each state has a Web page , where Net surfers can find out the names , addresses and phone numbers of local archives , genealogical societies and libraries and get advice on how to find basic data such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records . <p> As with the Internet in general , interaction is the project 's most compelling feature . Individuals can post queries on county pages like this recent sample from the Clark County , Ark. , GenWeb page : " I am looking for information on Henry L. Lightfoot , born March 25 , 1817 , died July 6 , 1857 , in Clark Co. , Ark . Also looking for name of parents of wife , Sarah E. Stanley . " The poster received a response within days . To date , 2,065 counties out of 3,109 nationwide boast Web pages . <p> Genealogists frequently enter the same inquiries in several places . Queries can also be put on some of the thousands of Web sites , mailing lists and newsgroups related to genealogy . Some focus on a particular state , region , ethnic group or family surname to help target the search . The major commercial online services , America Online , CompuServe and Prodigy , also offer comprehensive genealogy forums , where members can enter queries . <p> Adding further to the burgeoning resources , numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , card catalogs and , in rare cases , their records into digital form . The National Archives http : //www.nara.gov posts details of its records and instructions on how to access them on its Web page . The catalog of the Library of Congress http : **28;1024;TOOLONG is searchable online . <p> To a genealogical sleuth , the Web offers tantalizing clues and tidbits . Some of its clues led Virginia Kobler of Huntsville , Ala. , to unravel a family mystery . For 30 years , Kobler has been searching for facts about her **29;1054;TOOLONG , who  --  according to family legend  --  was the daughter of a William O'Neal and an Indian woman who died during childbirth . Kobler 's grandfather plied her with stories of their ancestors when she was a teenager . " I decided I wanted to prove them , " says Kobler , a genealogy addict . This summer , the Tennessee USGenWeb coordinator posted an index of the acts of the state legislature from 1796 to 1830 , acts that then related primarily to individuals . The index noted a two-part statute : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , providing a sought-after surname ; the other noting that her ancestor 's father was legally claiming her . Kobler immediately started tracking down the statute for more details . <p> Many families create Web pages to share their research or to announce the date of the next reunion , only to discover that they are magnets for unknown relatives . Billie McNamara of Knoxville , Tenn. , coordinates the Acuff family page http : **43;1085;TOOLONG . " We started out for five years having less than 10 of us doing research and sharing information , " says McNamara . Since the Web page made its appearance in March , more than 100 relatives have become active family searchers , cutting years off research time . Others are finding that E-mail messages can act as a family chronicle . Sharon Jones of North East , Pa. , is saving the folklore-laden messages she receives from her cousin in Washington State to pass on to her children . <p> The very openness of the Internet means that misinformation can be posted as easily as facts . " Just like published material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they seem to spread quickly , " says Shirley Langdon Wilcox , president of the National Genealogical Society http : //www.genealogy.org/ngs/ in Arlington , Va . Indeed , worried about the naivet of amateur genealogists who cruise the Internet , the society last month issued a warning about information exchanged online , pointing out the plentiful opportunities for mistakes . " Just because it came off a CD-ROM or the Internet does n't make it true , " says genealogist Witcher at the Indiana library . " We still need to go back to the original source documents . " <p> But despite the possibility of errors , the Internet is chock-full of good Samaritans . New , online friends helped Armeta Lee when she went online three years ago to learn more about her husband 's father , who vanished in 1945 . " Lemont and I have been married 41 years , and we have four children and three grandchildren , " says the Chino , Calif. , resident . " We have always wanted to find out what happened to his father . " One cybernaut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion group related to African-American genealogy , looked up census data at the National Archives for Lee . This new online pen pal found Champ and Leah Lee ( Lemont 's grandparents ) on the 1910 and 1920 censuses , along with their children , Clarence , Claudine , Clinton ( Lemont 's father ) , Ida , Leah and Henry . <p> Now comes the difficult job of finding the sisters , brothers and their offspring . Lee has spent the past six months posting messages far and wide throughout the Internet , to no avail . " Maybe one day our Lee family will meet the rest of the Lee family , " says Lee . Thanks to the Internet and the people behind the screens , the Lees may yet get their wish . <p> For more information , see U.S. News Online ( http : //www.usnews.com ) .
