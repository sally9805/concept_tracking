ONE : SETTING OUT There is no better place for the traveler than a land outside the scope of guidebooks , beyond the reach of maps , where only local knowledge matters and word of mouth is everything . China is just such a place now . You have to go there to find out what is happening . In my travels around China 's southern provinces of Guangdong and Fujian in April of this year , I discovered that roads are being built so fast , in so many new directions , that no maps are accurate . The guidebooks can not keep up with the hotels and restaurants that have opened  --  every one is out of date . So are telephone directories and company listings . These explosive changes make China terra incognita . I first visited China in 1980 . Since the death of Mao in 1976 a power struggle had been going on between the Maoists , led by Hua Guofeng , Mao 's handpicked inheritor , and the reformers , led by Deng Xiaoping , now the ruling patriarch . Hua 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hua 's cheek next to Mao 's jowl ; Deng 's face was nowhere , and yet from the shadows of the Chinese hierarchy he was sketching his master plan to revitalize China . This was not yet obvious . I sailed down the Yangtze and visited ten cities . China then was all struggle , people in blue suits and cloth slippers riding bicycles down muddy streets , workers going blind in poorly lighted factories , waiters refusing tips and chanting , " Serve the people ! " The only bright colors were the ribbons the more daring women and girls wore in their hair . Near Guangzhou ( Canton ) I visited a Maoist model commune called Da Li . It was like a good-natured prison of reluctant sloganeers and suppressed ambitions  --  71,000 people working 6,000 acres of rice fields and making Whistling Cicada brand firecrackers . It seemed at once appalling and wonderful for its unity and its innocence . Every job was carried out with crude tools and great spirit . It was a society of intimidating and ingenious frugality in which everything was mended  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but their ingenuity made them seem indestructible . In the spring of 1986 I made another visit to China , taking the train from London through West and East Germany , Communist Poland , the Soviet Union , and the People 's Republic of Mongolia  --  all of them gone now . I was astonished by the changes and new attitudes , the communes either closed or changed  --  the charade over , the rice fields buried , the people turned loose to find employment at large . Late in 1986 there were student demonstrations in most of the larger Chinese cities . Shanghai was shut down for two days . No one outside China took any notice . This past spring I returned to China for a third time , to have a look at what the newspapers were calling the " Chinese miracle . " What I had read did indeed suggest that something miraculous was afoot . Almost overnight , while few people were paying attention , China had emerged as the world 's third-largest economy , according to the International Monetary Fund , and as America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of 1993 , China 's GNP grew at an annual rate of 14 percent , outstripping every country in the world ; in contrast , America grew , in the first quarter of this year , at a 1 percent annual rate . The engine driving most of China 's growth is centered in the southern provinces , a region of 290 million people , where the government has established five Special Economic Zones . From what I 'd read , it sounded as though China had embarked on its own version of the type of industrial revolution that transformed England and America . Viewed from a distance , such changes seem wondrous , but up close the story turns out to be messier and more complicated . Like the dark , satanic mills of William Blake 's " Jerusalem , " the Chinese economic miracle has been a deranging process and an ecological disaster , as demonstrated by the chemical blast in Shenzhen last August that killed an estimated seventy people and destroyed eight warehouses . In some places air quality is the worst to be found on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of months , mountains are being moved , rice paddies filled in , forests cleared  --  a process that has caused devastating floods in south China . The dynamo of capitalism has been loosed , and the " creative destruction " that economist Joseph Schumpeter called the defining feature of nineteenth-century American capitalism is on display in the China of 1993 . It is a sight the likes of which few people alive today have seen . There was once a time when all American cityscapes looked like south China 's new industrial zones  --  most of us in the West live at the relatively tranquil terminus of a very messy economic process that had its start in a raw cityscape like Shenzhen or Guangzhou . Here is street after street of large , new factory buildings  --  structures similar to the factories I grew up with in Massachusetts , factories that fell into dereliction after World War II . Fall River had them , and so did New Bedford , Lawrence , and Brockton ; they still have them , but the structures have been revived now as " factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of south China are functioning versions of towns that are familiar to anyone who has lived in an urban area in Europe or America where the factories are now empty and the machines have stopped . Not just Boston and Chicago , but Bradford and Manchester in England , and Derry in Northern Ireland , and so many others . They have shut down . China is succeeding because China is at work . The world has put the country to work and has invested in it , and the world has received a return on its investment . Most people reading this article are rearing a Chinese shirt , or sweater , or trousers , or pair of shoes . " Traditional " English baskets are Chinese . Carved Christmas decorations are Chinese . Our do-it-yourself tools , hammers and screwdrivers and socket wrenches , are Chinese . Our children 's toys are Chinese . Our bikes . High-fashion beaded dresses are Chinese . Ninja Turtles are Chinese . The tires on our cars are Chinese . Many of the Japanese electronic goods we buy are actually assembled in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $200 per unit , making war all over the world cheap , deadly , and endless . In recent years China has sold Silkworm missiles to Iraq , and last August was suspected by the Clinton Administration to be shipping the chemicals used to produce mustard and nerve gas to Iran . The Chinese sell tin pots in African countries and baseball caps in America and , ever since the pit closures in Britain , might well be shipping coals to Newcastle . There is hardly a gift shop in America that is not stocked from top to bottom with candles and carvings from the many kitsch-producing provinces in China . Those pretty masks and doormats and mailboxes and Santa Clauses and almost-Hummels and porcelain dragons and classic cars that are so sensibly priced in an Olde Worlde Gyfte Shoppe ? They 're from China . And so , too , are high-tech aircraft parts now being made in Fujian Province , a place that for six thousand years was known only for its cork paintings and oolong tea . " In the nineteenth century , " Michael Lind recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands of settlement would actually import coolie labor from China and India by the thousands to compete with home-country nationals for jobs , driving down wage rates . In the twenty-first century , corporations may take the jobs to the coolies , as it were , rather than bringing the coolies to the jobs . " The Chinese dragon , scorned in the Maoist era as a superstitious symbol , is China 's favorite creature , one of its friendliest and most enduring guardian figures  --  a good omen representing power and prosperity . Now the dragon had risen again . It was breathing fire . I wanted to see it . TWO : ON THE ROAD TO SHANTOU Suddenly , on a road in eastern Guangdong  --  all bulldozers and buffaloes  --  my driver , Li Zhong Ming , veered left and began driving on the wrong side of the road . Was it the freshly dismembered human corpse , all its separate parts splashed Chinese red , scattered widely like a load of fresh pork off the back of a truck on our side of the highway  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No . Mr. Li liked spinning the steering wheel and whipping over to face the oncoming traffic . He had hardly glanced at the mutilated body . " This is quicker , " he said . Of course , the risks were enormous  --  trucks and buses bore down on us head-on  --  but he got in front of everyone with an eat-my-dust expression on his face , his teeth ajar in aggression . Mr. Li was so persistent I began to think of his driving on the wrong side ( and the carnage on the right , one of the numerous auto accidents I saw in an average day ) as a metaphor for modernized China . He booted our assembled-in-China Audi down the main road to Shantou ( old Swatow ) , past the red hills being shoveled apart and bulldozed to use for filling rice fields and making room for tenements and factories . The entire landscape was being leveled for hundreds of miles , and when it began to rain , water coursed down the clawed , eroded hills , washing silt into the sewers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong lane Mr. Li went again , playing chicken with oncoming dump trucks and tractors and bikes . He did not dodge them . He just blew his horn and surged forward against the flow of cockeyed headlights . Bolstering Mr. Li in his luck was a portrait of Mao Zedong on his dashboard . This gesture , wholly nonpolitical , was a recent fetish for drivers in China . Just a year before , a taxi driver in Beijing claimed in the People 's Daily that he had been spared in a car crash , in which there had been many fatalities , because he had kept a picture of the old man on his dashboard . Many Chinese drivers began using the picture for spiritual protection . This reminded me of the images of St. Christopher that I saw in cars when I was growing up in Massachusetts in the 1950s . Mao kitsch is popular in China again . You can buy Mao badges and Mao portraits , and embroidered knickknacks of the great man in baggy pants . His speeches are back in print . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan , " written in 1927 , after he had traveled around the countryside , noting abuses , jotting down wisdom , and making suggestions . That was what I told myself I was doing now  --  simply looking around , gathering impressions for my " Report on the Factory Workers of Guangdong and Fujian in this Era of Chinese Prosperity . " And , in fact , I was traveling to the music of Mao . In a dusty shop in a small town in rural Guangdong I had bought some Mao playing cards and some Mao cassettes . Memories of Mao was playing on Mr. Li 's tape deck , the tuneful " Dong Fang Hong " : The East is Red ! The sun rises ! China produces Mao Zedong ! We passed two men on a big red 350-cc joint-venture WuYang-Honda motorcycle , and the man on the rear seat was talking wildly into a cellular phone  --  making a deal without a helmet at seventy miles an hour . Gunning his engine , Mr. Li @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills and abandoned paddy fields and bamboo scaffolding where just months before there had been bamboo groves . These were the only landscape features apart from the freshly robbed graves , one of the more recent growth industries in rural China ( ancient artifacts such as pots and clay animal figures are unearthed to smuggle and sell for good prices in Hong Kong ) , and the odd forlorn pagoda , almost certainly doomed . But nothing ancient , nothing notable , nothing but new brown , crumbly buildings  --  factories and tenements  --  rising from the filled-in rice fields . I penetrated farther east into Guangdong , beyond the red hills and paddy fields and stands of bamboos , the muddy ditches and hot boulders , the haunts of snakes and eels and lizards and frogs , popular in the restaurants in these parts . In spite of all the new wealth , some things in China never change : the small side roads made by hand , squatting people pounding the asphalt flat with mallets ; the rice-growing process  --  women scooping water into the terraces using large wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men plowing with buffaloes , up to their knees in water . We passed cyclists transporting squealing pigs or lengths of steel reinforcing rods on their bike racks , and edge-of-town dump pickers , usually a man and a boy , studiously sorting junk into piles  --  glass , metal , rags , paper . There were barefoot men kneeling by the side of the road welding metal without masks or eye protection , sparks flying ; on the highest and most ambitious buildings , men erecting scaffolding of poles and tying them together with string or split cane strands instead of using metal clips ; gardeners lugging heavy buckets on yokes and watering their beautiful vegetable gardens ; men fishing for tiddlers in canals . " The principle of diligence and frugality should be observed in everything , " Mao said , though it hardly needed saying . Although I have a basic grasp of Putonghua  --  Mandarin  --  I was traveling with a translator in case the conversation became abstract or contentious . We came to a town . What was its name ? " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Bou Lou . " It was just a small place last year . " It would be a city next year . We then passed what appeared to be a movie set , all bamboo scaffolding and rising buildings , another city being created in the middle of nowhere , with an archway lettered WELCOME TO ZHANG MOU TOU . " So this is Zhang Mou Tou , " I said as we drove through the flying dust . " It 's not on the map . " " It is new . " Last year it existed as a mud-and-buffalo rice-growing village of ten huts . The buildings are rising , and to fill in the rice fields they have had to pull down all the surrounding hills , an amazing sight , just like the Maoist fable , quoted in the Little Red Book , of " The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains . " It was on the road that I had a vision of the new strangeness of China . Perhaps it was the twilight , perhaps it was the dust . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days I had been seeing additions , enlargements , new subdivisions , and districts , but this was something else  --  skeletal , unfinished , all of it brown with blown dust and dried mud . Everything was being built at once  --  the roads , the pedestrian bridges , the apartment houses , the factories , the stores . The buildings were thirty or forty stories high and still clad in spindly scaffolding . Because of the time of day , twilight , no one was working , and only workers were involved in this . No one lived here . Except for detour arrows , there were no signs . There was no color , nothing alert or alive . I had never seen anything like it in China , or the world , a whole city under construction , and what made it strangest of all was that no heavy machinery was in evidence  --  no bulldozers , no cranes , just the odd wheelbarrow or ladder and the stitched-together scaffolding covering every structure and making the city seem fragile . We drove through , looking for someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no one around . Then it was behind us . But this was south China . In a short time  --  months maybe  --  the town would be inhabited and brightly lit . THREE : GUANGZHOU As soon as you get to China you hear the success stories . Everyone tells them , affirming the Chinese miracle . The $8-a-week driver for the company in Shanghai who spent his nights at the free market flogging defective shirts with designer labels , used the profit to get involved in a joint venture , and is now making $60,000 a year and is the owner of a house in Australia , having paid for it in cash by sending his cousin to Sydney with the purchase price in a brown paper bag . Or the man who recognized a need for cycle helmets . His were very cheap , because his were very unsafe  --  just a plastic shell , but never mind , you could have one for ten yuan . This entrepreneur became a multimillionaire an prospered until he died in what was described to me as " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the Chinese , and always in a tone of admiration and amazement , because anyone who was in China ten or more years ago knows that this bountiful place exploded from a monochrome country of faded clothes and gruel , a scrimping , saving , mend-and-make-do society of toiling comrades . These days , however , the stories are of decadence and wealth : " Last year ten new Rolls-Royces were imported into Guangdong by Chinese businessmen  --  " " The most popular dish in Canton these days is lobster sashimi  --  " " There 's a massage parlor in Shenzhen staffed entirely by Russian girls  --  " " There is a Chinese businessman in Zhuhai who buys ten bottles at a time of Louis XIII brandy , and it costs thousands of dollars a bottle  --  " " It 's a feeding frenzy  --  " Some of the new fortunes are now made at the China Export Commodities Fair in Guangzhou , often called the Canton Trade Fair . The first official fair was held in 1957 . A frenetic bazaar , the fair fills one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only way foreign businessmen could do business in China , since they were forbidden to pass beyond the Guangzhou threshold into China . These days foreigners travel to factories around China to place their orders , and yet the trade fair remains the main focus of Chinese commerce . Here , buyers for Western corporations , middlemen , suppliers , and even individuals converge , buying goods by the containerload . In past years the fair 's areas have been demarcated by varieties of merchandise  --  carpets here , electrical appliances there , hairpieces and bikes over here , and so forth . But this year , for the first time , the fair 's stalls and stands were divided by provinces : Jiangxi here , Shandong there , Inner Mongolia right down the stairs . It costs about ten dollars to register as a delegate and have your picture inserted into an I.D . badge , and the rest is easy , like a long vulgar trek browsing through the biggest market on earth , a gift shop almost without end . In the lobby is a musical fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing " Do n't Cry for Me , Argentina . " The buyers are bused in from their hotels ; they are mainly huge sweating men and feverish-looking women from all over the world , squinting and poker-faced , like most bargain hunters . " Zis bench grinder  --  tell him I want two sousand pieces , " a Frenchman is saying to his interpreter . " When these shirts arrive Lebanon ? " a Levantine woman is saying . A man is buying an orange lifeboat , another haggling over cotton baseball caps made in Shanghai , which cost $7 a dozen , at 1,000 dozen per color , minimum order . A German is ordering sleeping bags , made in Tianjin in a factory that employs 2,400 workers . Two million are exported annually , a great number to Germany . The wholesale price for these well-designed ones  --  warm , light , easily compressible  --  is $11.80 a bag . I drifted over to a stall where a sign read FOSHON HARDWARE &; PLASTIC FACTORY , and in this one small space I saw fishing rods ( eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joints , cups , plastic flowers , brake shoes , welding electrodes , hinges , washers , faucets , windshield wipers , spoons , small toy dogs that jumped and yapped , and an assortment of cigarette lighters  --  fifty or more  --  one of which was a panther whose eyes lit up as its mouth expelled a jet of fire . In other stalls you could get a floor-length raccoon coat for $418 ( including delivery to California ) ; a " Chinalight New Magnetic Massage Cushion " ( $14 ) ; Black Dragon brand rollerblades made in the remote northern province of Heilongjiang ( $13.60 a pair , delivered ) ; a wig made of Chinese human hair , dyed blonde , Shirley Temple-style , for $10.25 . A mountain bike was $50 , cashmere scarves were $8 , herbal remedies and surgical tools were all reasonably priced , and a Xing Fu 250-cc motorcycle was $663 . The WuYang I had seen on the road with the passenger riding and talking on a cellular phone was $2,000 wholesale . There was every machine tool known to man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plaster saints and crucifixes than you would see in a whole year 's pilgrimage in Italy . I spent two days at the fair . My most productive time was spent at the tea stalls , where all the varieties of tea in China are displayed . My preferred type of tea is Long Ching ( Dragon Well ) , from Hangzhou . It is green tea , and its flat smooth leaves resemble the needles of a fir tree . " Why is this tea so expensive ? " I asked the tea company 's representative , Mr. Jin . " This tea is picked in a small area , " Mr. Jin said . " The best is found on just one hill . There are not many trees , the season is short , only two tons a month of the best quality are picked in the harvest season . " I discovered it on my first visit to China in 1980 and have drunk it ever since , buying it in Friendship Stores or else in New York , where the best quality sells for $50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is an impression you get only if you buy it outside China . This same tea at the trade fair can be bought for roughly $2 a box from the China Tuhsu Zhejiang Tea Import-Export Corporation . Walking through the exhibition hall , I came across a provincial stall selling herbal remedies , which included ginseng , royal jelly anti-cancer pills ( made of " myrrh , muschus , mastix , and calculus bovis " ) , and my eye was caught by something called " Love Solution . " It had something to do with health and sex , and the box claimed that with it " 100% , of AIDS virus and chlamydia can be killed within two minutes . " There was a spray version for men , a plunger for women . Many of the products at the fair are lovely and finely made  --  the carpets , the embroideries , the lace , the silks . The tools are among the finest and cheapest in the world , and have put many American tool companies out of business . But if there is one business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hardly a Santa or a hanging ball on earth is not produced in the People 's Republic , and even the Christmas lights that were formerly made in Taiwan are now made in China , many of them in joint ventures with Taiwanese partners who are looking to find cheaper labor as wages have risen in Taiwan . " Are they any good ? " I asked in Italian , Mario from Modena , who was in Guangzhou for no other reason than to buy Christmas lights to sell in Italy . " They 're very good , " he said . " They conform to Italian standards . They are cheap . It 's perfect . " And he smiled . " But this place "  --  and he made an Italianate gesture , his hands and face simultaneously expressive , to take in not only the fair but Guangzhou and perhaps the whole of China  --  " is " orrible , eh ? " Yet Mario knew better than to dismiss what was before us . We were talking about how China made everything and shipped it everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturer for the world . " Browsing through items at the fair , I understood why the Chinese are considered to be masters of the art of copyright infringement and have found it an effective way to generate business , make enormous profits , and earn hard currency . Despite being closely monitored in Hong Kong by people representing the brands and labels that are assiduously pirated , the infringers get away with murder . " Take running shoes , " a Hong Kong lawyer told me . " It is a billion-dollar business . I am not exaggerating when I say a billion . They make the shoes and label them NIKE or PUMA , they put them in boxes printed MADE IN KOREA , and they ship them all over the world . " The Chinese purloin trademarks and labels and logos willy-nilly . You do n't have to be in China very long to recognize the rip-offs . Mickey Mouse is gallivanting all over China without a license  --  on every conceivable consumer item  --  and sometimes Mickey wears a curiously almond-eyed expression . The Playboy bunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh Hefner . Knockoff Swiss Army knives are fairly common . Lux soap has been popular in China for so long that there are a dozen pirate versions , with the same colored wrapper and often the same name or a similar one  --  " Lid , " " Lix , " " Lud , " " Lus . " These items are exported to Africa and Southeast Asia , where they may be found stacked near " Goldgate " toothpaste and " Rodigate " toothpaste ( the same Colgate colors , no relation ) , " Pepsi-Cola " biscuits , or fake and almost unchewable Chiclets . False labeling  --  especially regarding the label of origin  --  extends to clothing exported worldwide but especially to the United States , which last year purchased $4.5 billion in clothes and textiles from China , this despite certain quotas that are reached by negotiation between the two countries . China 's production far exceeds its quotas , so many Chinese products are given labels such as MADE IN HAITI or MADE IN MONGOLIA and transshipped through those places , the third-country connection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only apparent chinoiserie . MADE IN MONGOLIA has been very popular on Chinese labels because little is manufactured in that country of grasslands and yaks and nomads . Why is the in China label now so commonplace ? There are many reasons : the collapse of Eastern Europe and the fragmentation of the Soviet Union created new markets and diverted investment to China . The world recession inspired manufacturers to look for cheaper labor and more consumers  --  China , these businessmen discovered , not only can make electronics and Ninja Turtles at a fraction of the cost of making them elsewhere , for even less than in traditional cheap labor centers such as Taiwan and Korea and Hong Kong , but also can supply an immense new domestic market . That 70 percent of urban households in China now have color televisions and 81 percent have washing machines suggests a growing middle-class market ; that there are 750 million people in China under the age of thirty-five foretells a twenty-first-century economic juggernaut . Last year the government approved 48,000 new foreign investment projects , and foreigners invested $11.2 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . So suddenly China is no longer a sprawling , monolithic gerontocracy of enigmatic ideologists but rather an enormous if somewhat clumsily businesslike place that inspires confidence among the world 's venture capitalists . Perhaps it is this simple : Foreign investment was invited . Factories got built . The Chinese workers accepted the lowest wages in the world . They did n't argue . They were not religious . Because of their peculiar political indoctrination , they were totally materialistic . And they showed up on time . FOUR : SHENZHEN As recently as 1971 , Shenzhen was no more than a railway platform lettered SHUMCHUN twenty miles north of Hong Kong in the province of Guangdong . In 1980 , I described it in my diary as a wilderness of barricades and barbed wire ; it had just been designated a Special Economic Zone . Now an ancient-seeming metropolis , Shenzhen is vast , with a railroad station almost as large as New York 's Grand Central and scores of hotels . It is a city of 2.5 million , nearly the population of Hong Kong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the city is as famous for its prosperity and buoyant stock market as it is notorious for its massage parlors and prostitutes , its organized ( and approved ) gambling , its bustling streets and busy factories brilliantly lit by blinking signs . On a visit to Shenzhen in 1992 Deng had said , famously , " I like this . " Mao 's legacy is all those communes and collective farms that have been reconstituted as manufacturing villages or else plowed under , their people dispersed to find their niche in the labor market . Deng 's creation is Shenzhen , for he set into play the forces that allowed its seemingly spontaneous birth . At eighty-nine years old , Deng is often rumored to be near death . His face appeared on a billboard in Shenzhen looking ghostly and cadaverous . A lifelong chain-smoker who has carried an oxygen bottle for the past eight years , he has emphysema , which was evident in his sucked-in cheeks and popping eyes . On the billboard he was making an admonishing gesture with his fingers : If you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reforms If you do n't develop the economy If you do n't improve your livelihood Then the only way for you is death . In a simplified history , China 's prosperity may be charted by the rise of Deng , whom from an early stage Mao had sniffed out as a " capitalist roader . " Later , Deng was described with more elaborate contempt as " an arch unrepentant capitalist roader and harbinger of the right deviationist wind . " Yet this comrade in arms turned pariah is someone who , politically speaking , came back from the dead  --  and not once but three times . One of the many goals of the Cultural Revolution was to rusticate the bureaucrats and " class traitors , " to sweep aside such bourgeois notions as modernization , and to take the starch out of the people who had become known as revisionists . Deng , the son of well-to-do landlords , was put under house arrest . One of his sons , Deng Pufang , is said to have been thrown or dropped out of a fourth-story window ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of Zhou Enlai in 1976 , an event that provoked greater grief and more intense emotion in China than the death of Mao later that same year , the Maoist Gang of Four were arrested for conspiracy . They were blamed for ( among many other things ) the excesses of the Cultural Revolution , and Deng was reinstated to the party and to all his posts by the Eleventh Party Congress in 1977 . In 1979 and 1980 , Deng consolidated his power and put his friends and like-minded associates and bridge partners and hatchet men in key posts . Any illusion that Deng was a high-minded Jeffersonian at odds with the forces of Marxist-Leninist darkness was shattered in 1980 , when , for political convenience , he proposed deleting the four freedoms from the 1978 constitution : speaking out freely , airing views fully , holding debates , and writing big-character posters , the traditional form of political protest . Deng 's proposal was endorsed in the fifth plenum in 1980 . In the same year , Deng established the Statute of Joint Venture and the new Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been going on since the visit by Richard Nixon in 1972 , these two policy changes marked the beginning of contemporary China 's prosperity . They meant that foreign companies could start factories in China with Chinese partners , that capital and technology could be easily transferred , and , perhaps most important , that foreign loans ( both government and private ) were permitted . Just as crucial , it meant that business affairs were decentralized . Now foreign businessmen could negotiate directly with factories , bypassing the bureaucracy ( and bribery ) entailed when every deal had once had to be routed through the ministries in Beijing . With this start of China 's Open Door Policy came some practical steps to develop China . One was the concept of Special Economic Zones  --  sealed zones where foreigners could transact business without stinking up the rest of the country with their decadent or subversive notions . Special money also was created , not renminbi ( people 's money ) but Foreign Exchange Certificates . So , just over the Hong Kong border station of Lowu , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a place then known in its Cantonese form as Shumchun , a new city was planned . Stung by the ferocity of the Cultural Revolution , and receiving mixed signals from the right and the left of the party , the Chinese people were at first tentative in carrying out Deng 's exhortations . His cry " To get rich is glorious ! " remained little more than a yearning . What I saw in China in 1986 and 1987 was mainly confusion , tentative movement toward a free market , and severe official punishment for crime ( 10,000 people were executed for various crimes between 1983 and 1986 ) . After the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre , it appeared that China was in the economic doldrums . This was an illusion . As we now know , a serious businessman is unlikely to be deterred by a little thing like a massacre . Deng himself was unrepentant about the killings . " Kill a chicken to scare the monkeys , " he said , quoting a Chinese proverb to justify the massacre he had ordered . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War to hack a soldier to pieces in front of his regiment in order to make a vivid and memorable point about discipline . The feebler the pretext , the sterner the lesson . Deng is often described as " pragmatic . " His desire to host the Summer Olympics in the year 2000 was strictly to give China an aura of international respectability and had nothing to do with the Olympic ideals of fair play and brotherhood . Mao , by contrast , had a sort of monstrous style . He was a romantic , a poet , almost Byronic , and yet someone who rather enjoyed his reputation as a demonic manipulator . He was happy to hand power to the Red Guards and turn the country upside down for ten years just to see what would happen . Deng is without charisma  --  does n't have it , does n't want it . No cult of personality has grown up around him , nor will it in what remaining time he has left . His briskness and frankness are a reaction to the time-wasting and secrecy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an emperor whose image was iconographic . Deng is a sort of blandly non-ideological CEO and is almost faceless . One of his main dictums of reform is " Tight on the inside , loose on the outside . " went to the market in Shenzhen with a friend of a friend , Mr. Lu , who told me , " I would much rather live here than in Hong Kong . I have a larger apartment here than I would have in Hong Kong . Shenzhen is cleaner and better organized . " When I asked Mr. Lu about his family he said , " They were very red , " meaning they 'd had power but no money , had never been landowners , and were party members . I took this to indicate that their credentials were perfect during the Cultural Revolution . Mr. Lu said this was so . I asked him whether he had been active himself  --  he was forty-eight , just the right age . He said yes . Had he been a Red Guard ? He said yes . " What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the reddest , " he said , and smiled , as though having been a member of this fanatical ultra-leftist unit had been a youthful indiscretion . Mr. Lu had been teaching English in 1966 , but after being subjected to intense self-criticism ( essays , confessions , recitations ) , he had become a Red Guard . His unit fought regularly with other units , mostly throwing chairs at one another , over which unit was the truest guardian of Mao 's thought . In 1969 , Mr. Lu was chosen as a model Red Guard , having worked for a year at a lathe , making parts for machine tools , in a factory in the countryside . Machine tools during the day , Marxist-Leninist study at night . He was selected to be a propagandist , traveling the country , galvanizing Red Guard units , and leading political pep rallies from Mongolia to Shanghai . In his spare time he studied revolutions around the world . Then , when foreign visitors began arriving , Mr. Lu , whose English was now an asset , was appointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenneth Galbraith was one . Just after Deng took control , Mr. Lu was sent to study in the United States and Canada , and that experience , the sight of prosperity , transformed him . " It was the way people lived , " he said . " I wanted that for us . " Mr. Lu became a passionate reformer . In June 1989 he was at the barricades in Tiananmen Square . " It was too bad that some students died , " he said , obviously chastened by the violence . " But that is the past . We have to be optimistic . " I asked him about the man whose speeches had incited the students , Professor Fang Lizhi , now in the United States . " The great number of Chinese people do n't care about his ideas . He is better off in America , anyway  --  he is more American than Chinese . " Mr. Lu seemed the perfect person to walk around Shenzhen with . He was small and slight of build but he said that , having been through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether it was walking a long distance or carrying a heavy load . As we passed the railway station , I mentioned that we could nip through the turnstiles , hop on a train at Lowu , and be drinking a beer in Hong Kong in less than an hour . I had made the trip myself from the other direction one rainy morning  --  caught the subway train outside the Sheraton Hong Kong , changed trains in Kowloon Tong , and was at the border before I had finished reading the South China Morning Post . I had gotten back to Hong Kong Central in time for lunch . ( " I would n't mind seeing China , " the English poet Philip Larkin had said , " if I could come back the same day . " That was now possible . ) " I do n't like Hong Kong , " Mr. Lu said . " It 's too crowded . " " Is it too full of gweilos ? " I asked , meaning foreigners . Mr. Lu laughed politely , so I asked him about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he happened to be with another Chinese person and one of them called attention to an American in the distance , would they normally use the term " foreign devil " ? ( " That foreign devil is very tall , " for example . ) " Yes . If he was a man . If it was a woman we would say gweibo . " " Devil-woman . " " So to speak . " There were , however , no gweilos here , no tourists at all . Why would they come here ? I had seen no tourists in Guangzhou . None in the provincial towns . There was a park in Shenzhen , but it was not for foreigners ; it was for the Chinese , a China theme park , Splendid China , with replicas of every " sight " in China : a Great Wall section , a temple , a pagoda , a group of terra-cotta warriors , and so forth . Tourists , I realized , are an irrelevance in these economic zones ; there is no place for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is nothing to see . The Shenzhen market covered six acres or more . At the butchers ' stalls the cheapest meat was chicken at $1.20 a catty ( 500 grams ) , beef was $1.20 , pork was $1.40 , dog was $1.75 , and snake was $18.75 . The dog-meat section of the market was no different from any of the others  --  a series of long stone slabs smeared with blood , with blood-flecked Chinese working their cleavers through stringy bone joints . The creatures themselves were either gutted and strung up on hooks or else piled in cuts , and even headless they were recognizable as dogs , from their long narrow muscles and their lean haunches . As I drifted around the city with him , it was clear that Mr. Lu had put his Red Guard past behind him . He was proud of this proliferation of factories and housing blocks . Shenzhen was undoubtedly the best-organized city in China . The authorities tried to keep crime to a minimum  --  although this had become a major challenge . Eighty-two men in Shenzhen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitution patrons " ( and a " half-year re-education " was also part of their punishment ) . But young women still quietly solicited in many bars  --  they wore the current Chinese hooker fashion of very short shorts , once known in America by the evocative name " hot pants . " The women were pretty . There were brothels too , many of them using the cover of barbershops ( " I got suspicious when my husband needed a haircut every day , " a wife says in a current Shenzhen joke ) . The women did not bother Mr. Lu . He called them " flies . " " If you open a window , you get some flies , " he said , and he might have been quoting one of Deng 's speeches . Whenever we saw something decadent or jarring in Shenzhen , Mr. Lu said , with the Chinese gift for euphemism , " More flies . " One night in Shenzhen Mr. Lu and I were in a restaurant that at ten o'clock was abruptly turned into a disco , the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when one could be sent to a pig farm in Mongolia for listening to Western music . There we were , talking about the future of Hong Kong over our shrimp and bamboo shoots , and the lights dimmed and young men began setting out sound equipment and tuning their guitars . " Hong Kong will be handed over . China will give no assurances . These people in Hong Kong who are asking for elections and referendums are wasting their time , " Mr. Lu was saying . Then the lights were dimmed , the youths appeared , and the music started ; and it was so loud we could not hear each other . The guitarists wore silver jogging suits , the lead singer was in blue . I recognized one or two of the songs  --  Michael Jackson was obviously popular here . Then the singer started hectoring the audience and waving green slips of paper . " What 's he saying ? " " He 's asking for requests . " The idea was that you would write down your request and hand it over to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a request . I want him to sing " Dong Fang Hong . ' ' " Mr. Lu , delighted , copied down the Chinese characters and we passed it to the singer , who glanced at it and called out to his musicians . And without batting an eyelash , he began marching in step and singing " Dong fang hong ! Tai yang shang . " The East is Red ! The sun rises ! China produces Mao Zedong ! He works for the happiness of the people He is the savior of the Chinese people The East is Red ! When the musician was finished , he went back to singing rock songs . FIVE : HUIZHOU Having taken in the cornucopia of bargains at the trade fair , I was curious to see where these products were made . I had heard of a well-run factory in Huizhou , and so I went by road through east-central Guangdong to this once sleepy town and met Mel Dickinson , the Welsh manager of a factory run by the Austrian family firm of Swarovski , purveyors of crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , Dickinson arrived in Huizhou , the only expatriate in town . His orders were to sort out an almost bankrupt jewelry factory . It was like being sent to an outpost in old China , the gweilo stuck in a factory in a riverbank town in rural Guangdong , hating its snakes , consoling himself with his pint of Tsingtao beer at night while he labored with his workers to produce costume jewelry by the ton . The heat , the rubble , the stink , the terrible town , the melancholy  --  it could almost have been a portrait out of Somerset Maugham 's On a Chinese Screen or the much earlier narratives of American or European expatriates in China . Dickinson considered my comparison and then said , " People like me came in the nineteenth century , and they lived the way I do . But they exploited the natives . We do n't . " This proved to be true in Dickinson 's case . He was a kind and hardworking man , clearly liked by his workers . His factory , Huisi Fashion Jewellry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the province , Number One for Light-Industry in Guangdong , for being the best-run , the most productive . Dickinson and his wife , Freda , had come to Huizhou in January 1989 , " and almost walked straight out . The factory was filthy and silent . All I saw were workers having naps amidst orange peels and peanut shells . But I decided to stay . I liked the town . It was quiet and very safe . " Four months later , production was in full swing . Soon after that , the students occupied Tiananmen Square in Beijing . " Not a peep here in Huizhou , " Dickinson said . " It was business as usual . There were some tanks in Guangzhou . " The Chinese no longer need permits to travel around the country . This fact now allows for the movement of labor and keeps wages low . Within four years things changed in Huizhou . Prices tripled . The small town became a very large town of 2.3 million  --  a city , by American standards . More factories opened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on by developers flocked from the surrounding countryside ; unable to find jobs , they slept rough and made the place unsafe with their murders , burglaries , muggings , and fights . Highway robbers frequently went through a hijacked bus emptying passengers ' pockets . The day before payday , when the Huisi safe was full of cash , one of the factory workers broke in . Dickinson and some other men caught him before he opened the safe . The man received a four-year sentence for the break-in . If he had managed to get the safe open , he would have been executed . " This is the Wild West now , " Dickinson said . " The authorities try hard , but it 's not enough . Go downtown and you 'll see masses of policemen . But after five o'clock there wo n't be any . They 'll all have gone home . " Dickinson was modest and humorous in his self-effacing Welsh way , but he was clearly proud of his factory , pleased of its awards and its profits . The enterprise had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sold in American department stores ( $40 earrings , $60 pendants ) , the sorts of things that make women say , " These are fun . " But the jewelry had caught on locally and was now being snapped up all over China . Soon the Christmas orders would be coming in and 350 people would be working to turn out bracelets , pins , necklaces , and pendants . His employees earned between Y350 and Y400 a month ( $60-$70 ) , and their hours were 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. , with an hour off for lunch . The factory , which looked like a gray-brick Victorian high school , seemed a happy place , most of it air-conditioned , all of it well lighted . Yet what impressed me about the operation was the amount of technical training the workers received as designers and model-makers creating the baubles . Three employees were being sent to Thailand to study another Swarovski operation . Everything  --  the wooden models , the rubber molds  --  was made on the spot . Even the tin alloy was bought in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women were polishing earrings and pins . " Polishing is the expensive part of the operation . See that ? " It was a gold mushroom , curvaceous and gleaming , about two inches high . " A polisher can do only five an hour . That 's why you can not afford to polish in Europe . " He told me that a worker in Ireland would get 15 Irish punts an hour , perhaps $25 . A polisher in China was paid 50 cents and did the job just as well . Anyone wondering why world manufacturing had moved to China might consider this simple example . " This is the heart of the factory , " Dickinson said in the electroplating shop . " This is where we make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear . " The alloy was plated with a layer of copper and then nickel , then was gilded in a solution of potassium gold cyanide , which Dickinson bought in large quantities ( about $10,000 a kilo ) from Hong Kong . Being in a well-run , happy factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this part of China . They were mostly in villages and damnably hard to find . I had tried to visit one , but the owners kept them hidden and off-limits , not wanting their exploitation to be observed , particularly by a foreigner . I knew from various informants that the classic sweatshop was a textile-or umbrella-making or simple electronics operation owned by a Taiwanese or Hong Kong businessman , and typically it was an anonymous building in a rural village to which all the employees had been brought from one of the poorer provinces five or six hundred miles to the west , Sichuan or Gansu . Back in the courtyard after our tour , I asked Dickinson whether he had seen places with very bad working conditions . " Oh , yes . I 've seen many . Even joint ventures . They were so awful they would have made Charles Dickens throw up . " " What about sweatshops ? " " They 're all over the place , but you 'll never get in . My secretary 's brother worked in one , though . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her name was Linda and she was in her late twenties , formerly a schoolteacher . Her English was excellent . " My brother works in one of those places . At first he was making ovens ; now he is making telephones . He works until ten or eleven at night . Most weeks he works seven days , but now and then he gets a day off . His boss is from Taiwan . " For this he was paid Y200 , or $35 , a month . Such pay was not exceptional ; in fact , many of the rural people who had come to Huizhou would have settled for that sort of job . " See that man ? " Dickinson said to me as I was leaving . A dapper Chinese man in a well-cut suit , his hair fashionably permed , was picking his way across the cobbles of the courtyard with his narrow shiny shoes . He was in his thirties , the new executive  --  little man , big Rolex . I had seen enough of such people to realize I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was more interested in daily life as it was being borne by the majority of people  --  workers , gardeners , market traders  --  and in the changing configurations of the landscape . Still , this man was unavoidable . He was a client from Shanghai and had come to sign a contract for an order . When the man was out of earshot , on his tour of the factory , Dickinson whispered to me , " He has a check in his pocket for me , made out for 1 million renminbi . That 's the down payment . His order is two and a half million . " There was another man in the courtyard , a cripple , and his body was so twisted and misshapen he could move only by occasionally touching the ground with his free hand , straining with his serious face . But he was tidy , his clothes were clean . He made his way crabwise through the gate to the porcelain factory next door . " I 've been looking at him for four years , " Dickinson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mel Dickinson was kindly and solicitous of his employees ; he was also atypical . Most factory bosses are more like the man I met who ran a large wholly owned American enterprise in a city forty miles outside Huizhou . I promised my informant I would be circumspect . I was met by a fresh-faced American manager , who asked me why I happened to be interested in his company 's product . " I 'm planning to write an article , " I said , " about change in south China . And your part in it . " " Wait a minute , " he said , becoming officious . " I do n't want to be in your article . I do n't want to be quoted . I do n't want my name on it . Everything I say has to be off the record . If you want information , you can talk to our P.R . people in Hong Kong . " " It wo n't be much of an article if I use public-relations brochures , " I said , thinking that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among old Commies and hacks in the old Marxist-Leninist China . " I 'm sorry , I ca n't help you . " " I was just curious about your experience in China . I promise to respect your wish to be anonymous . " The Nameless American Factory Manager in the Nameless American Factory considered this and finally said , " We 're doing very well . We 're on schedule . Everything 's going ahead . We have a great team . " He set his face at me as though defying me to find anything wrong with what he had just said . I found a great deal wrong . He was unhelpful and probably untruthful . It was the sort of thing you would have heard from the cadre of the Revolutionary Red Star Work Unit during the height of the Cultural Revolution . " How many people do you employ ? " " Eighty-five . " " What do you pay people ? " " See ? " he fumed . " That 's the wrong question ! Why do n't you ask whether they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the rest of the benefits ? " " I was coming to that , " I said ( and he might have added haircuts and showers , two other perks Chinese workers receive in joint-venture factories ) . But , seeing that I had stung him , I persisted with my wage question . " About Y500 a month , maybe less , " he guessed . Call it Y450 . That is $80 a month at the official rate of exchange . It was slightly above the going rate by Chinese standards . The clothing factories , run mainly by Taiwanese and Hong Kong businessmen , pay Y200 or less a month . " That 's a very good salary here , " the man said . It is very likely that he was earning 250 times that amount . " What if your workers did n't think it was adequate and decided to go on strike ? " " They 'd have a problem . We 're a non-union operation in the States . We do n't deal with unions , we deal with individuals . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint . " I doubted that anyone would risk it . Even in our brief conversation this Nameless American seemed to me to be a rather forbidding person . He told me that he had been living in a hotel in the nearby city for almost seven months . A manager of a plant in one of the western states of America , he had never lived in China before . " How do you like it here ? " " It 's an incredible place . " " I think I named the city is horrendous . " " I 've seen fewer beggars here than in his hometown in the United States . " " Have you been to the railway station ? Every third person is bumming money . " " Maybe you 're right . I was n't counting that . But there 's no hippies . In his hometown you find hippies everywhere . Guys with long hair , just living off the government . I 've got a personal pet peeve against graffiti . His hometown is full of it . You do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humble house , they 're still neat and clean . I like that . " Very soon after that , he signaled that the interview was at an end and that it was time for me to leave the building . He did not offer to show me the plant . He repeated that he did not wish to be quoted or identified . I said I would respect his privacy , and I believe I have . The man 's identity does not really matter . What was notable was that in the course of the conversation he had , without realizing it , more or less parroted Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung . He believed in obedience , cleanliness , thrift , learning by doing and hard work ; he wanted each worker to be the " rustless screw " of Maoist ideology . I had the distinct sense that most American businessmen in China were Maoists in the same sense , not dreamers like the old man , but resembling the monopolistic-minded bureaucrats who followed him , the Hard Liners ( Qiang ying pai ) or Extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leftist " in China is actually very repressive and right-wing , and , to their delight , many foreign businessmen find the leftists have a great deal in common with their own enthusiasms , prejudices , and obsessions . A kind of moral blindness afflicts many people who do business with the Chinese , since , along with everything else , China is still a dictatorship of pitiful wages , fairly miserable living conditions , and a brutal legal system , and still practicing such quaint customs as convict labor , child labor , and mass ( and often public ) executions . Most people engaged in trade with the Chinese are so besotted by their profits that they could not care less about these things . Even where the public health is concerned , business is business . When the British pharmaceutical firm Glaxo estimated that there were 30 million asthmatics in China , they set up a $10 million factory to make an anti-asthma medicine in a joint venture , choosing an appropriate city , Chongqing , where the air quality is reportedly eight times worse than normal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People . " It deals with unity and harmony . He writes , " As for the imperialistic countries , we should unite with their peoples and strive to coexist peacefully with those countries , do business with them and prevent any possible war , but under no circumstances should we harbour any unrealistic notions about them . " Elsewhere in the essay he writes , " We must learn to look at problems all-sidedly , seeing the reverse as well as the obverse side of things . In given conditions , a bad thing can lead to good results , and a good thing to bad results . " Mao had been prophetic . Many of the cities and towns I saw in Fujian and Guangdong , with the exception of the Special Economic Zone of Xiamen , looked much worse than they ever had , more crowded and chaotic and far less comfortable than ten or fifteen years ago . The gardens and parks were a mess , people 's manners generally were aggressive and their attitudes insufferable . The physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a transitional stage , is in tatters . Strangely , this is considered progress . SIX : ZHUHAI The ancient places and the new places in developing China seem interchangeable now . This is an effect of the building boom  --  frugal , hastily erected structures did not age well and looked elderly and in need of renovation as soon as they were finished . So far , the Chinese miracle has not encompassed graceful or even sturdy architecture . The Chinese have a genius for putting up buildings that are instantly seedy and almost ruinous . As soon as the ribbon is cut , the dust clings and the cracks appear . Zhuhai , a one-hour ferry ride from Shekou across the wide , tea-colored river mouth of the Pearl , was a Special Economic Zone . The ferry , the Hai Shan , had 400 seats , and , this being China , every seat was taken . Each one was numbered and reserved . You would have thought that since everyone had his or her own seat , boarding the ferry would be a relaxed business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle to get up the gangway . Whenever a signal is given in China , people jump . It is as though there is a deep memory of individuals having gone hungry or gotten lost or been left behind because they hesitated or were n't aggressive enough . The habit learned from periods of extreme poverty has now become a Chinese reflex , the instinct to push toward any door , any vehicle , any ticket window ; shoving is the only way forward . And so China is an experience of elbows , now more than ever . This get-it-now instinct has been officially sanctioned , and some of the features of society that old gweilos and older Chinese lament are the absence of politeness and the presence of a new reckless assertiveness . I was on half a dozen airplane flights , and each time the plane began to descend people threw off their seat belts and jumped up and staggered down the aisle , to be first off the plane . Flight attendants howl and the passengers retreat , but when the flight attendants ' backs are turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving unsteadily in the landing or taxiing plane . Even traffic in Chinese cities or on congested roads seems to push and compete in the same way , cars and trucks beeping and queue-jumping , moving quickly into any available space . Just a few years ago Zhuhai was a village resort , yet now it looked as old and citified as Macau , founded in 1557 . Walking from the Gong Bei district of Zhuhai to Macau  --  it took me an hour , including passing through two sets of immigration officers  --  is like a stroll from one side to the other of the same decrepit city . Yet Zhuhai , on its breezy bay , was one of the more pleasant places I saw . It had beaches and parks and a main drag . In every restaurant and lobby bar there were Chinese talking on cellular phones ; and on one occasion at each of six tables around me there was someone talking on a phone . Five years ago it was almost impossible to make a call from the best hotel . The boom in telecommunications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear beepers . " The Yellow Trade "  --  the euphemism for vice in China  --  was brisk in Zhuhai . The city 's fairly steamy reputation no doubt derived from its proximity to Macau , as Shenzhen 's derived from Hong Kong . But the present concern with manufacturing and the downplaying of tourism has meant that the Yellow Trade is mainly for locals or visiting provincials . A foreign tourist industry would have produced much larger numbers of massage parlors and call girls , more vicious practices , much higher prices . The narrow lanes in Gong Bei were the haunt of skinny hookers in shorts and high heels , and they circulated among the outdoor restaurants and sidewalk cafes and the men selling live snakes  --  xiao long , little dragons  --  out of baskets ( Y500 each , for the thick ones they called Cross Mountain Blacks ) . Fengboshan Park , in the center of the city , was popular among transients and seniors , and in a vice raid while I was in Zhuhai ten men were arrested there , the eldest seventy-two . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were published . Full sexual intercourse cost up to Y60 , or about $10.50 ; bosom-touching was Y10 ; and " nude peeks " were Y5 . As in other parts of China , barbershops and hairdressers were the cover for " relaxation services " ( masturbation at Y50 ) . The city is notable not just for adventures in the skin trade but for violent crime too . I asked various people about the crime rate . They all said yes , it 's terrible , it 's these outsiders , young boys mostly , no respect . No one cared to elaborate . No one liked discussing this subject with da bidzi ( " Big Nose " ) , and who could blame them ? Two interesting facts emerged , though . The people said many of the thieves carried weapons . That was alarming . The second fact was that armed robbery was always a capital offense in China . And everyone I spoke to was in favor of the death penalty  --  for murder , for robbery , for arson , for pimping , you name it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the growth in prosperity and reform , there were more executions than ever , and in some cities crime was out of control . I 'd had death-penalty conversations many times before in China . The Chinese response was still unanimous . Give the criminal a bullet in the head . Let the victim 's family watch the death throes , and make the criminal 's family pay for the bullet . One argument for the death penalty is that it deters crime . I happen to think this is a specious argument , and it is manifestly not the case in China , where the crime rate has risen right along with the number of executions . Amnesty International reported in May 1992 that " estimates from unofficial sources for the number of executions in 1991 range from 5,000 to 20,000 . " The escalating use of the death penalty in China since 1989 is apparently continuing : in the month of January 1993 , Amnesty International recorded 1,891 death sentences , including more than 1,000 executions . When I challenged a more forthcoming Chinese man named Liu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in spite of the death penalty , " because they do n't know the law . " " But the government publicizes the executions , " I argued . " They drive the condemned men around town in the back of a truck , with signs around their neck . They put the dead people 's pictures up at the railway station . How could they not know ? " " They are ignorant . " " But everyone in China knows that they will be executed for committing certain crimes , " I said . Mr. Liu said , " Some people feel it wo n't apply to them , that they will get off with a prison sentence . " Sometime later , a woman said to me , " Many people in China do not value their lives . They do n't regard their lives as precious , and therefore they 're willing to take risks . " It was in Zhuhai that I was able to verify the rumor about expensive brandy . I found some likely bottles at the Zhuhai Merchandise Fair and asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis XIII Grande Champagne Cognac , selling for Y8,580  --  that was almost $1,500 a bottle . " Do you sell many of these ? " I asked . " About four a month . " " Any to gweilos ? " " No . All to Chinese . " Later that day I was marveling about this to a Chinese woman , who said to me , " When Americans first came to China , we thought they were rich . Now it is we who are rich . " This remark led to a discussion about envy among a number of Chinese around me . Several of them maintained that there was very little envy in the new China . " If a person gets rich , the attitude is " Good luck to him , ' ' " one Chinese said . " If I work hard I 'll get rich , too . " " You do n't burn a man 's house down because he has a better one than you , " another Chinese said . " There is even a sense that the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this view was contradicted by a man who described hong yen bing , or " red eye disease , " a chronic condition in China wherein the envious person stared greedily at anyone who had more than he had . Most of the speakers agreed that the wealthiest people in China were hidden . They were not the people one saw on the streets , talking on cellular phones , buying expensive brandy , or wearing Rolexes . They were perhaps living as they always had , except that they were squirreling their money away , preferably in hard currency ( the currency dealers thronged every sidewalk in these economic zones , pestering and offering twice the bank rate for Hong Kong dollars ) . People with disposable income bought gold , TVs , appliances . Some bought land . Many believed that the best way to position themselves was to buy stocks of newly listed companies on the Shenzhen stock market . Inflation , which was running at around 16 percent , was the cause of some of this behavior . It was also the cause of a labor dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been eighteen strikes in Guangdong in 1993 , but they had been small affairs . This strike was different because the workers were reasonably well paid , the company was immensely profitable , and some of the strikers were administrative staffers . After a three-day stoppage , the 800 striking workers were back on the job while talks continued . The workers ( who were earning from $85 to $175 a month ) wanted a 30 percent to 50 percent raise in pay to keep pace with inflation . They were concerned not only about rising rents and house prices but also about the recent increase in bus fares and the cost of cigarettes . Canon 's Japanese owners had offered 7 percent . There was a stalemate . There may still be a stalemate , both sides refusing to budge . But for the workers it is a losing battle , because there will always be Chinese lining up for jobs at low wages , and the Chinese government has made it very nearly a duty for its nationals to work uncomplainingly . Despite such obvious signs of capitalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adheres :  --  Adhere to Marxism-Leninism  --  Adhere to the Socialist Road  --  Adhere to Proletarian Dictatorship  --  Adhere to Party Leadership " Do people repeat these things ? " I asked . The answer : " Yes . Like the Bible . " I thought , Exactly , because that clearly reminded me of all the cant and hypocrisy that goes under the name of Christianity . And it was no different for the Chinese , who were able to parrot party slogans while at the same time hustling on the black market or trying ( as one man did ) to run me down in his BMW while he talked on his cellular phone . SEVEN : AT THE FERRY IN SHEKOU I was standing at the ferry terminal in Shekou , the old merchants ' quarter on the east bank of the Pearl , and was approached by half a dozen young men . who began jeering at me , flicking cigarette lighters in my face and nagging me with the Chinese locution for " Are you buying or not buying ! " They followed me , heckling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since my return to the People 's Republic that I 'd had the sense that this prosperous , overcrowded , and in-your-face China was much more like the pre-revolutionary old China than like the period dominated by Mao 's selfless mottoes of anti-capitalism . Old China in my mental image was an ugly landscape of factories and farms , expatriates and competing crowds , back lanes ringing with the hammers of tinsmiths , and vast cities of tycoons , prostitutes , beggars , hawkers , hustlers , and peasants  --  furious activity , everything for sale , crowded streets , markets piled high with produce , an intensely competitive commercial life , factories turning out crystal goblets , and sweatshops making shirts . Except for the occasional intrusion of police , life went on , and politics was a novelty and a nuisance that no one liked but everyone tolerated . Old China had not been a tourist destination either . Last April I thought of this in many places in south China , the ones that had grown in four or five years from being landing stages on tributaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These settlements looked much like ones in the old bustling China . But behind their appearance was something new and crucial : the memory of the intervening Maoist years . Why be sentimental ? seemed to be the Chinese attitude now . Why trust another leader ? This was a pushing and shoving China that had learned its Maoist lesson of self-reliance and survival , and rejected the rest of the Maoist altruism . Because of the hardships and unpredictable events of the Maoist years , people had developed sharp elbows and an instinct to snatch what they could while the time was right . Mao , of course , had wanted to create a population of revolutionaries . But in the end his campaigns and purges turned out to be an elaborate form of aversion therapy . For what seems to have emerged from the Age of Mao was a vast army of reactionaries and opportunists . Mao 's greatest success  --  though he may not have realized it  --  was in turning his people into single-minded materialists . Ideologically speaking , the Long March has taken a sharp right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days , they become Americanized , and often lose their cultural identity . China is the exception . The more China develops , the more it seems to be turning back into the old China , just as regional and unequal , ambitious , busily self-sufficient , and hard to read as China in the Tang dynasty . As it modernizes , it reveals a greater complexity and a deeper Chineseness . And yet there are differences . Whereas the old China was informed by Confucianism and , in some places , Christianity , China now seems totally materialistic , cannier , wiser , even selfish . The provinces of Guangdong and Fujian may have the oily , muddy look of old China , but except for filial piety they have few of China 's old reverences , the Confucian virtues of refinement , gentleness , decency , and good order . And there are the throwbacks that show in something as simple as tipping . In Maoist times it was not done . Then , with the tourists and businessmen of the 1980s , some tips were given . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transaction takes place or service is given . There can be a real ugliness when a tip is not offered , and there is a new permutation  --  for many services the tip comes before any act is performed . In a very short time in China tipping has turned into bribery . Or is it bribery ? After all , this is the East . Perhaps a tip has turned back into what it has been in this hemisphere for thousands of years  --  baksheesh , not a reward , but merely the cost of doing business . The pressure to get things done quickly has bred crime . With bad roads and slow services and backed-up deliveries , grease helps . Many people I spoke to in China , foreign and Chinese alike , said that grease was an absolute necessity for a smooth business operation . Their view was that prosperity without crime is almost unthinkable . Corruption is not new in China , but it has become pervasive , and China 's biggest single social problem will continue to be crime . The triads , crime syndicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seemed to be scamped out have returned , many from Hong Kong and Taiwan , where these ritualistic brotherhoods and protection rackets were reconstituted . And the highwaymen and cat burglars are back . As recently as seven or eight years ago , you could with confidence have sent your seventeen-year-old daughter traipsing all over China alone . No longer . China has become unsafe ; I feel it is likely to become even less safe . But then , it was for thousands of years a country famous for its defensive perimeters  --  behind the Great Wall were more walls , walled compounds and fortified cities . These days , look at any new housing development of condominiums or apartments or single-family dwellings and you will see high perimeter walls . Outside these walls there are the poor , some of them predatory , most of them simply pathetic . They are the rural poor of subsistence farmers in neglected provinces that have never known prosperity in the whole of Chinese history . It is doubtful that life will change for them . In the cities the struggle will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more of the old China , more conspicuous wealth and ownership and a deeper oppression , of which the client and his prostitute are just one version , and the factory owner and his sweatshop are another . No one owned gold in Maoist China  --  there was none to buy  --  but before Liberation , the Chinese had always been great buyers of gold and jewelry . The habit is back and was one of the factors in the spectacular worldwide rise in the price of gold in the first half of this year . It is not greed ; it is another technique of survival , a Chinese way of concentrating wealth , protecting against inflation , and hoarding against the inevitable hard times ahead . Deng , they know , is not long for this world . His chosen successors are , like him , believers in economic progress , not political change . But it remains to be seen whether they prevail . In the past , whenever times were bad , in periods of famine or war or repression , the Chinese  --  the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their belongings and fled for their safety and well-being . Not all Chinese have gold in their little bundles , but some do . The others pay it in advance to men who smuggle them out of China and into other countries . As recent events have shown , even in a time of Chinese prosperity , people wish to leave China , many of them for the United States . China 's growth and destabilization may come to have important consequences here . American immigration officials estimate that as many as 80,000 undocumented Chinese are arriving each year on America 's shores , and the number is rising . Until recently , Chinese life was not so much enigmatic as unknown . We did not have a clear perception of Chinese stubbornness , tenacity , or materialism ; the Chinese lack of illusions ; their strong sense of family ; their powerful survival instinct ; their hatred of complainers ; their passion for secrecy . More than any people I have ever come across , the Chinese are obsessive about living in the present . They do n't look back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , splendor and misery , of their history there is too much to look back upon  --  and so it is fatal to be sentimental . Chinese life is both active and hesitant , like a creature being pursued , now in motion , now stopped and tremulous , never at rest , always alert . The Chinese clock has a tick unlike any other on earth , sometimes fast , sometimes slow , contracting , expanding , with an alarm that might go off at any moment . We Americans expect tomorrow to be pretty much like today , and perhaps a little better . We find it strange that a people should perpetually anticipate disasters . But then , six thousand years of disasters have made the Chinese skeptical and somewhat untrusting . These days everyone speaks of the Chinese miracle , but when has the world taken much notice of Chinese catastrophes , of which the Japanese rape and plunder of China before and during World War II and the earthquake that instantly killed a quarter of a million Chinese in 1976 are but two instances ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since " future " in Chinese terms might mean a brutal decree or sudden reversal enacted in the dark hours of tomorrow morning . What they are doing now was illegal yesterday , and might be proscribed once again . Understanding the uniqueness of the Chinese clock , you begin to get an inkling of Chinese hope and the attentiveness of Chinese labor . Their sense of survival is not a racial but a political imperative , for Chinese life is full of instances of people who lingered and looked back and were lost , overwhelmed and buried by one avalanche or another in their country 's long , unpredictable history .
