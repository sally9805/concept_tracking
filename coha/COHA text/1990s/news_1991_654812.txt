<p> SOUTH Africa 's new ambassador to the United States , Harry Schwarz , is a fighter who has a record of getting his way . <p> He is the first major political appointee from outside the ranks of the ruling National Party and is sure to bring a radically different style to Pretoria 's diplomacy in the US . <p> Mr. Schwarz , who took up his post in Washington earlier this month , has a reputation as a political street-fighter and a brilliant debater . He is a successful lawyer , businessman , and financial commentator with international contacts . But , in some ways , he is an unlikely diplomat . <p> " He has a very quick temper and will have to learn to keep his cool , " said veteran human-rights campaigner Helen Suzman , who has been both a political foe and colleague . " We started off in politics on not very good terms , " said Mrs. Suzman . " But that has changed substantially over the years . We have learned to respect each other . " <p> Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet that South African President Frederik de Klerk has undergone a political transformation . <p> " It is De Klerk who has changed , not me , " said Schwarz in an interview at his legal firm here before he left for the US . " I have no quarrel with him today . " <p> Schwarz arrived in South Africa some five decades ago as a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany . He served as a navigator in the South African Air Force , qualified as a lawyer , and was a member of the defense team at the treason trial of Nelson Mandela and seven others in 1963-64 . <p> He has consistently opposed apartheid and advocated a federal system with a social market economy , as well as a return to the rule of law from the state of emergency that has been in effect since June 1986 . <p> These values - once on the margins of South African politics - have landed him in the mainstream debate over the " new South Africa . " But his strong stand on defense and law and order earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made him a controversial political figure : He has been a thorn in the side of every political party . <p> When he quit the opposition United Party to join the Progressives in the mid-1970s , a UP front-bencher warned : " He 'll be a stone in your stomach for the rest of your lives . " To some of his colleagues in the Democratic Party - successor to the Progressives - he has been just that . <p> Some happy to see him go <p> " Some of us are delighted that he is leaving , " said one Democratic legislator . " Now we can stop taking tranquilizers before the weekly caucus meeting . " <p> Despite his position of privilege , Schwarz is a passionate social democrat and one of the loudest voices for the deprived emanating from the white establishment . His calls on whites to make material sacrifices for black advancement have drawn abusive phone calls . But Schwarz is not easily diverted from his chosen course and is a persuasive advocate of his beliefs . <p> " He is a brilliant debater with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zac de Beer . " He goes for the jugular quicker than anyone else . " <p> Schwarz confounded some of his colleagues by not joining the National Party . He accepted De Klerk 's offer now only because he believes that the process of political change is irreversible and that De Klerk is sincere . <p> For the past few months , Schwarz has been making contact with the full spectrum of political opinion in South Africa . He has met - and took part in a public debate - with South African Communist Party leader Joe Slovo . He had Nelson Mandela to dinner at his home , renewing a relationship that goes back three decades . <p> " I have been quite surprised by the positive reaction to my appointment , " Schwarz said . He has been regarded with suspicion in anti-apartheid circles because of his hawkish views on security . <p> Schwarz has a strong sense of mission and insists that he will be a hands-on ambassador : " My job , as I see it , is to normalize relations between the US and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusions that the lifting of international trade sanctions - which gained momentum with US congressional action in 1986 - is going to be either rapid or easy . But he said there is much that can be done in the interim to restore Pretoria 's access to international capital . <p> Schwarz said he will try to convince international development agencies that loans directly linked to black advancement can be granted immediately . <p> " Most of my time will be spent in one-on-one interviews with movers-and-shakers in the US , " he said . <p> Schwarz has strong views about what the US role in the future of South Africa should be : " The US led the world 's moral outrage against apartheid , " he said . " Now it has a strong moral obligation to see that the system which follows is a true democracy . Americans can not just wash their hands of South Africa once apartheid is finally abolished . " <p> Schwarz sees the US role as exposing South Africans - black and white - to American values and educating them about the fundamentals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans understand that every South African should be entitled - under the new constitution - to enjoy ... the rights which every American enjoys under the US Constitution , " he said in his farewell speech to the South African Parliament in February . <p> Sees important role for US <p> " Our people need to see the vital role played by the Supreme Court in the US , " he said . " It is this respect for law and the power of the courts which I want to see enshrined in a South African constitution , " he told Leadership magazine in a recent interview . <p> But he said he did not think political consensus would be the most difficult part of the transition . " The toughest part is the economy , " he said , " the conflict between limited resources and high expectations . " <p> Schwarz is adamant that the prospects for investment depend on whether political violence can be eliminated and realistic economic policies adopted . <p> He said that the black caucus in the US Congress has a special role to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Schwarz . " Their influence could be more important than any other group . " <p> Schwarz leaves little doubt about his goal : He wants to see the US use the same moral suasion with undemocratic black leaders as it has exercised on the country 's white minority rulers . <p> Conveying this message will call for true diplomacy . <p> " He will have to transform himself from a militant politician into a seasoned diplomat , " said Mrs. Suzman.
