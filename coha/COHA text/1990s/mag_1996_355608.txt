The author 's message was headlined APOLOGY and inserted in 250 fresh-off-the-press children 's books given to guests at last week 's Congressional Black Caucus Foundation luncheon in Washington . " I apologize to you all for the atrocities which I and others committed against our race through gang violence , " wrote Stanley ( " Tookie " ) Williams , who in 1971 co-founded the nation 's largest and arguably most violent street gang , the Crips . " I pray that one day my apology will be accepted . " <P> The founder 's atonement , of course , is overdue . By current law-enforcement tallies , Crips colors fly in 42 states , and the gang is linked annually to thousands of murders , robberies and drug deals . But if Williams , 42 , has much to regret , he has also done more than apologize . Writing with stubby pencils from San Quentin 's death row in California , the convicted murderer published this month the first half of a 17-book series titled Tookie Speaks Out Against Gang Violence . " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , effective prose . " It 's the best set of books I 've ever read on this subject , " says Franklin Tucker , director of Washington 's National Center to Rehabilitate Violent Youth . " And it 's coming from the choir . " <P> Not the church choir , admits Williams , who was condemned to death in 1981 for fatally shotgunning four unresisting victims during motel and convenience-store holdups . But his transformation , he insists , should be judged separately from his crimes . Arriving at San Quentin in 1981 as a feared gangsta godfather , Williams was content for years to watch sullenly from death row as gang violence spread  --  and with it , an urban nightmare . <P> Fiercely resistant to authority , Williams spent nearly seven years in solitary confinement and turned to exotic self-help works , including a text on ancient Egyptian philosophy . " I slowly realized I was living a lie , " he says . " The respect I cared so much about was based on intimidation , not self-respect . I had been involved in madness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a history of the Crips and Bloods , Williams asked a favor in return . Becnel carried a videotaped speech by Williams condemning violence to a 1993 gang " summit " in Los Angeles . The audience responded with a standing ovation . Next , Williams told Becnel he wished to write children 's books . " I hear this rhetoric about helping one child , " he explained . " That 's not enough . I wanted to help thousands . " <P> Becnel agreed to collaborate , and negotiated a contract with Rosen Publishing Group , a small New York house specializing in supplemental reading for " at risk " children . " The power of his writing was very clear from the beginning , " recalls publisher Roger Rosen . " He has a wise and compassionate voice . " <P> Williams ' slim first volumes , dictated to Becnel on the prison telephone , are aimed at kindergarten through fourth grade . Next he will write nine longer volumes for young teens . " Prevention is everything , " he explains . " By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
