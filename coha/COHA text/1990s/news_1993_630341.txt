<p> Roasted armadillo and iguana tamales are specialties of the house at Yu Ne Nisa , Ofelia Toledo 's restaurant in Oaxaca City , Mexico . Toledo 's delicious cooking is known far and wide throughout the Oaxacan valley as well as in the United States , and its fame has spread largely by word of mouth by those who know good regional Mexican cooking . <p> Recently , Rick and Deanne Bayless , owners of Chicago 's Frontera Grill and Topolobampo , played host to Toledo as she demonstrated her culinary skills . Although iguana and armadillo were n't on the menu , the dishes she did prepare were good enough to tempt her students to consider taking the next flight south of the border to sample more of the exotic local delicacies . <p> Oaxaca City , capital of the state of Oaxaca , on Mexico 's southern Pacific coast , is nestled in a valley between two chains of the Sierra Madre mountains . Several ancient ruins , such as Monte Alban and Mitla , surround Oaxaca and were once inhabited by the Zapotec and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned the sites and moved to newer cities , Zapotec Indians such as Toledo have not forgotten their roots . This is reflected in her pre-Hispanic cooking style , learned from her mother , grandmother and aunt . <p> Toledo 's heritage was proudly displayed in the beautiful and brightly colored huipile ( traditional blouse ) she was wearing from her hometown of Juchitan . It also was evident in the indigenous ingredients ( including achiote paste , fresh masa , chile morita , raw sugar and dried whole shrimp ) she brought to demonstrate her cooking magic . <p> From the moment she greeted the class with a warm " Buenos dias , " her hands were busy creating dishes with flavors as intricate as the embroidery on her blouse . Rick Bayless acted as interpreter for Toledo as she conducted the class in Spanish . <p> She told how her tiny venture of making and selling garnachas ( little appetizers ) out of her garage eventually expanded to a full-service restaurant , which has been in business for five years and is located about fifteen minutes away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oaxaca 's tourist district , will be opening soon . <p> " Once you eat my food , you 'll never come back to Chicago , " she said proudly . <p> For starters , Toledo prepared shredded beef garnachas made with a simple yet delicious salsa , topped with piquant pickled cabbage . Then she created two magnificent moles ( MOH-lays ) - rich sauces - both served as stews with tender , hand-formed masa ( corn ) dumplings . <p> The first mole was made with whole dried shrimp ( very characteristic of the Oaxacan region ) ; the second , with toasted pumpkin seeds . Both stews were creamy-rich , thickened with a puree of pumpkin seeds instead of cream , a process that is traditional when making classic moles . <p> Toledo finished with stewed pork in achiote , a sauce made from a paste of ground annatto seeds . <p> As she added the achiote paste ( ground for her by her grandmother ) to the cazuela ( a shallow clay pot ) of simmering pork , Toledo explained that there are many variations of achiote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oaxaca , achiote paste is used in its pure form , not adulterated with other spices . Achiote lends a unique flavor to sauces and turns them a rich shade of red . <p> Toledo recommends serving the pork in achiote with black beans and rice . When asked by a student what she would serve to drink with this dish , even those with just a basic understanding of Spanish understood the reply - " Cerveza " - ( beer ) , which made the entire room roar with laughter . <p> As the lesson ended and her students savored the dishes Toledo had prepared , one commented that on a recent trip to Oaxaca , she tasted many great sauces but could n't distinguish the flavor of any one ingredient . <p> The most important cooking lesson a mother passes down to her daughter , Bayless responded , is : " If you can taste one element of a dish , it was poorly prepared . A dish that is properly prepared has a perfect balance and a complexity of flavors . " Ofelia Toledo learned that lesson well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
