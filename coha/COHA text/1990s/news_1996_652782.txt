<p> IT HAD TO HAPPEN . AS SURELY AS the irresistible force had to meet the immovable object , as surely as Frankenstein had to meet the Wolfman , Roger Norrington and his London Classical Players had to confront Richard Wagner , the fountainhead of everything against which Mr. Norrington , and all of Early Music , have been in constant zealous revolt . The resulting CD ( EMI Classics 5 55479 2 ) , which contains the " Rienzi " Overture , the Prelude to Act III of " Lohengrin , " the Prelude and " Liebestod " from " Tristan und Isolde , " the " Meistersinger " Prelude , the " Siegfried Idyll " and the " Parsifal " Prelude , is one of the most fascinating recordings of the year just past , and one of the most important . Which is not necessarily to imply that the performances it preserves are any good . <p> Wagner , the paragon of the " elastic beat " ( as he called it himself ) , the bottomless Adagio , the vertiginous climacteric ? Wagner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the snuffer of Enlightenment , the reactivator of pagan myths and striker ( according to a Bavarian fan ) of " the fundamental chord of German being " ? The very least one could say about Wagner is that he was the un-Classical incarnate . <p> Till now , that is . Like his Beethoven and his Berlioz , his Weber and his Verdi , Mr. Norrington 's Wagner turns out to have been a crypto-classicist all along . Like the others ( and like everyone else Mr. Norrington 's baton has touched ) , Wagner secretly liked his music to sound light , fleet and steady . Did he not himself complain , in his treatise on conducting , that other conductors took his pieces too slowly ? And for the last hundred years have they not been getting slowep ? <p> Like Mozart , or like Stravinsky , Wagner cast virtually all of his music in dance or march rhythms , Mr. Norrington contends , elaborately though the composer may have disguised them . ( The " Tristan " Prelude ? A slow waltz , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Traviata . " ) The best performance , Mr. Norrington implies , will be the one that ferrets out that underlying pulse and makes it palpable . <p> These are all novel , interesting ideas . The question , as usual , is how much they have to do with what Wagner ( or his audience ) wanted then and how much they have to do with what Mr. Norrington ( and we , his audience ) may want now . It comes as no surprise that the second possibility is much more plausible , and much more readily supported , than the first . <p> That is an old story by now , and it is high time Mr. Norrington and other " historical " performers dropped the historical pretense . The " classical " Wagner Mr. Norrington purveys is a Wagner adapted to a certain brand of modern taste . The appeal to history and the composer 's intentions is just a way of claiming privilege . <p> Mr. Norrington himself turns out to be the best witness against his own historical claims . " Ever since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have been gripped by a desire to treat Wagner as if it were music and not some unique mystic substance that could only be perceived through a very slowly swirling mist . " That desire preceded and guided whatever historical research Mr. Norrington has done , and it is a very modern desire  --  the quintessential modernist desire , in fact , as Jose Ortega y Gasset noted 70 years ago in in his great essay " The Dehumanization of Art . " <p> Ortega 's somewhat scary title actually refers to nothing more than the modernist wish to strip away the illusion that art represents or embodies the attributes of human beings . Instead , Ortega insisted , we should prefer to see art for what it really is : pure artifice , the diverting product of consummate skill deployed for no other purpose than play . And play  --  delight in pattern , in finding solutions to self-imposed problems and arbitrary constraints , in doing things for the sake of the doing and making things for the sake of the making : play is the highest human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one farthest removed from biological necessities , and because it calls forth the purest exercise of reason , the faculty that sets humans apart from other life forms . <p> As Ortega famously put it , " art must not proceed by psychic contagion , for psychic contagion is an unconscious phenomenon , and art ought to be full clarity , high noon of the intellect . " <p> There has never been an artist more wholly identified with psychic contagion and all its dark perils than Wagner . Resistance to Wagner , which has always accompanied devotion po him ( even within a single , divided mind , as many of us can testify ) , is founded on perception of that threat . These are the real stakes behind Mr. Norrington 's opposition of music to Wagner 's " mystic substance " and " swirling mist . " His performances , far from a historical restoration , are the exact opposite : an exorcism . And therefore , as a cultural statement , they are at least a thousand times as significant as any historical restoration could be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can in support of his approach , and in one case his efforts to hide his exorcism behind a screen of fidelity have ruined his rendition . That one case is the " Meistersinger " Pre'ude , the one composition for which we have Wagner 's detailed description of his own performances . He conducted the opening section , marked " Sehr massig bewegt " ( " Moving very moderately " ) , in a four broad beats to the bar , he tells us , and that broad four is to be regarded as the " Hauptzeitmass "  --  the main tempo  --  of the prelude . But he also tells us that he managed to bring in the whole piece in just over eight minutes . <p> Always attracted by speediness , Mr. Norrington takes the eig't-minute boast as a challenge and resolves the contradiction between the stipulated tempo and the stipulated duration by deliberately misreading Wagner 's text . He applies the composer 's description of the basic meter in its fastest modification , some 90 measures into the piece , to the opening theme with ludicrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The " vigorous quarter notes " Wagner describes go by too fast to be felt as beats . The often highly detailed rhythmic surface of the music becomes a finicky muddle , and the four horns , three trumpets , three trombones and tuba in Wagner 's orchestra ( for all that they are mellow " period " models with narrow bores ) sound like so many pachyderms in joyless lockstep . <p> It is altogether possible that Wagner did conduct the " Meistersinger " Prelude to his own satisfaction in eight minutes ; but if so , he must have found a relationship among its various tempos that has so far eluded Mr. Norrington . The conductor 's downfall , in his ill-considered race with the composer , was the sin of prideful pedantry  --  but how delicious ! As lovers of " Die Meistersinger " will note with relish , it 's Beckmesser 's revenge . <p> Fortunately , Wagnar did not specify the durations of the other pieces here , or describe his performances . Mr. Norrington , therefore , is free to rely on selectively marshaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he frankly calls his " inst'nct . " Basically , this means following the old canard  --  how often must it be disproved ?  --  that 19th-century musicians did not use vibrato . And it means applying a bit of proudly advertised string portamento ( sliding pitch ) , which amounts , maybe , to one one-hundredth of what Wagner would have considered normal , and therefore unremarkable to the ear . <p> Such effects are flimsy selling ploys . Relying on instinct is much the better policy . But of course no one is born with Wagnerian instincts . When musicians speak of instinct , they mean prejudice . And when Mr. Norrington 's anti-Wagnerian prejudices lead him into direct collision with the composer 's presumable intentions , things get interesting . " Tristan , " the ultimate bearer of psychic contagion , is the inevitable touchstone . <p> Once again , Mr. Norrington 's prejudices are demonstrably those of a modernist . His performance is fascinatingly of a piece with a curious little article by Ira Braus , a music theorist of similar modernist bent , which recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why Does n't Anyone Play Bars 1-11 of ' Tristan ' in Tempo ? " <p> ANSWERS WOULD SEEM TO come readily enough . How about because the score is marked " Slowly and languishingly " ( " Langsam und schmachtend " ) ? Or because the whole thrust of Wagner 's remarks on conducting had to do with achieving a sufficiently nuanced and flexible execution ? Or because the interrupted cadences , and the silences between them , give tangible form to the " yearning , yearning , unquenchable , ever-regenerated longing  --  languishing , thirsting " of which the whole story of the opera , according to Wagner 's famous program note , is a metaphor ? Mr. Braus , however , sweeps all of that away . Unless the piece is played in strict tempo , he asserts , its structure is obscured . That structure is something wholly independent of all the contingencies that are usually  --  and irrelevantly  --  brought to bear on the act of performing it . <p> Mr. Braus 's ideas about structure are peculiar ( though familiar enough in the academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share them . But two aspects of Mr. Braus 's discussion illuminate Mr. Norrington 's project very effectively . <p> One is its profoundly ahistorical , even antihistorical stance . As a structure , the prelude is absolutely autonomous : independent of its maker 's intent , of the story it introduces , of all metaphor . All of that amounts to no more than the historical circumstances of its origin , long since left behind . For all Mr. Norrington 's talk of historical practice , his performance , which comes close to realizing Mr. Braus 's prescription , is similarly focused on the autonomous structure . That is the music , as he puts it , as opposed to the contingencies  --  the " swirling mist "  --  through which we are usually ( but no longer ! ) forced to perceive it . <p> The other pertinent premise is the " factual " nature of the structure as both Mr. Braus and Mr. Norrington reveal it . Through rigorously " objective " formal analysis like Mr. Braus 's  --  or " objective , " minimally nuanced execution like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion that is objectively verifiable by reference to the score , and therefore accessible to all . That kind of universality was the Enlightened ideal : Kant 's " sensus communis " ( " common sense " ) in its original , most radical formulation . <p> It is a democratic ideal and a socially uniting one . It requires no inspiration , no special gifts . By contrast , the insights of Romantic genius , the interpretations of a Maestro conductor or the " readings " of a master critic deny the commonness , or " in-commonness , " of sense . They foster social difference , distinction between the elect and the mass . Wagner was a great fetishizer of such value-laden divisions : between the inspired Walthers and the pedantic Beckmessers , between holy German art and Gallic artifice , between honest Gentile and rootless Jew . Mr. Norrington 's attempt to " classicize " and rationalize him  --  in short , to render him accessible to common sense  --  all at once assumes the character of a trenchant social and political critique . <p> That critique takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance the Prelude and " Liebestod " have ever received . The first 11 bars , to apply the Braus test , are not entirely " in tempo , " but all pauses and hesitations are coordinated precisely in terms of that " slow waltz " beat . You can hear it ticking away : one extra waltz measure between the first and second phrases , two between the third and fourth . There is , in short , nothing " irrational " about the pauses . We can all beat time along with the conductor , even during the silences . <p> Thereafter , Mr. Norrington keeps things moving briskly in flagrant violation of Wagner 's expressly marked ritenutos and rallentandos . So much for the composer 's intentions . Mr. Norrington is after bigger game . And so much for poor Jane Eaglen , the soppano who , as Isolde , gets to express nothing but what is there on the page , accessible to all . No erotic rapture , no goose bumps , no psychic contagion , just a quick march to premature Transfiguration that in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its glaring overreliance on melodic sequences . <p> It is all high noon of the intellect and sharp commentary  --  as un-Wagnerian as could be , but a blazing manifesto of t'e 20th century 's drastic rejection of swirling mists and Germanic inwardness . No Wagner lover will ever listen to Mr. Norrington 's magnificent subversion for pleasure . The pleasure is for the Wagner hater who lurks within each of us , Wagner lopers included . The dread Teutonic forest-beast is at last defanged . The Enlightenment strikes back . This disk belongs in every home .
