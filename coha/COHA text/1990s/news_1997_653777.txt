<p> Coopers &; Lybrand and Price Waterhouse , two of the world 's largest accounting and consulting firms , said yesterday that they planned to merge their practices worldwide . <p> The combination of the two firms , now part of the so-called Big Six , would create the world 's largest accounting firm ; it would have had $11.8 billion in worldwide revenue last year and about 135,000 employees across the globe . Andersen Worldwide , which has reigned as the largest firm because of the sharp growth in the consulting side of its business and had $9.5 billion in worldwide revenue in 1996 , would be pushed aside to No. 2 . <p> The merger is subject to approval by several government bodies as well as the two firms ' 8,500 partners  --  who have not yet even agreed on such simple details as what to call the new entity . Still , the proposal represents the latest chapter in the consolidation of the accounting industry , set in motion by fierce competition and slow growth in the core auditing business . <p> The world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went through a flurry of mergers in the late 1980 's when Deloitte Haskins &; Sells coupled with Touche Ross &; Company to create Deloitte &; Touche and Ernst &; Whinney joined with Arthur Young &; Company to form Ernst &; Young . <p> The latest combination would shrink the Big Six to a Big Five , making more mergers within the group difficult , if not impossible , because of likely antitrust concerns and the lack of an easy fit among the remaining firms . <p> " This may be the last one that really makes sense , " said Arthur W. Bowman , editor of Bowman 's Accounting Report , an Atlanta newsletter covering the profession . <p> Industry observers say that while the merger is certainly no shotgun wedding , both firms needed to find a partner or face the risk of being left behind as the larger firms become even more powerful . Despite a strong reputation in the profession , Price Waterhouse is the smallest of the Big Six firms and has less than half the worldwide revenue of Arthur Andersen . " They needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bowman said . <p> Coopers , too , is also likely to benefit from the linkage . While larger around the globe , the firm has a relatively small presence in the United States . <p> " I think it 's been a foregone conclusion that Coopers needed to find a merger partner , " said Richard C. Breeden , a former Coopers partner who now heads his own consulting business in Greenwich , Conn . " This is a good fit . " <p> The merger would allow the two firms not only to jump ahead of rivals in terms of revenue and partners but also to offer their clients a broad array of consulting and accounting services . <p> While Coopers has a strong presence in Europe , for example , Price Waterhouse has been more active in Asia and South America . In the increasingly important area of consulting , which is more lucrative and faster-growing than traditional auditing services , the firms have largely different areas of expertise and little overlap among clients . Coopers is well known in the area of human resources and strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in certain issues of technology consulting . <p> " Managing globally a professional services firm in a truly integrated way will differentiate this firm into perpetuity , " Nicholas G. Moore , the chairman and chief executive of Coopers &; Lybrand , said in an interview yesterday with James J. Schiro , his counterpart from Price Waterhouse . Mr. Moore will serve as chairman of the combined firm , while Mr. Schiro will be the new chief executive . <p> The need to develop a larger presence in consulting appears to have been one of the main prods for the merger , according to industry analysts , and is one reason why the merger did not immediately raise the specter that large layoffs might also loom . <p> Together , the two firms have about 6,500 employees in the New York metropolitan area . But all of the accounting firms have been frantically competing for the people needed to build their businesses . " Warm bodies is what you need on the consulting side , " said Tom Rodenhauser , the editor of Consultants News , based in Fitzwilliam , N.H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern . The merger creates the potential for greater conflicts of interest among the firms that both serve as independent auditors and consultants . " Consolidation raises that issue , certainly , " said Mr. Breeden , who also served as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission before joining Coopers . <p> Most Americans do not know or care too much just who pores over the financial statements of the public companies whose shares they buy , with one possible exception : everyone knows it is Price Waterhouse that figures out each year exactly who won the Academy Awards . <p> But continued consolidation of the profession raises the risk that auditors may lose their independence , something the investing public should very much care about . If firms are worried about losing valuable consulting business , will they still come down hard on clients who play games with their books ? <p> It was just such a concern about auditor independence that led to the formation in May of a new private-sector organization called the Independent Standards Board . Headed by Chancellor William Allen of the Delaware Chancery Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devise guidelines for auditors . <p> Price Waterhouse and Coopers partners are expected to vote on the merger in several regional elections scheduled to take place by the end of the year , and the firms will need strong support for the deal to take place . <p> Accounting partners can be notoriously mutinous , as in the case of Andersen Worldwide , whose partners have twice recently defeated nominees for the top job in an internal rift about whether the accountants or the consultants should control the firm . While the process varies from country to country , two-thirds of the Coopers partners and two-thirds of the shares voted by the Price Waterhouse partners in the United States will be needed for approval of the merger . <p> And Price Waterhouse has failed twice before to reach the altar . The firm tried to join with Deloitte in 1984 and failed again in 1989 when talks with Arthur Andersen broke down when concerns over Price Waterhouse 's unfunded pension liabilities emerged . <p> While Price Waterhouse and Coopers insist that those issues have since been addressed , many details concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call the new firm . " That 's one of the challenges , " said Mr. Schiro , whose firm is thought by many in the industry to have the stronger name of the two , at least on the accounting side of the business . <p> Yesterday , though , was the day to be open-minded about outcomes . " We have two very strong brand names , " offered Mr. Schiro , noting that the firms will use a consultant to help them settle the question . <p> Loose ends or not , observers believe the merger will probably go through . " I doubt it would have gotten this far unless they agreed it was a real good bet , " said Suzanne Verity , the editor of Public Accounting Report , an industry newsletter . <p> If the merger is completed , the firms will have the challenge of integrating their operations , which industry observers say could take two to three years . " It is a good time to do a merger , " Mr. Bowman said . " You can absorb some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mergers , which were driven by the need to reduce the size of the firms and cut overhead , this one comes as both firms are relatively flush with high revenues per partner . On average , Price Waterhouse 's 3,300 partners generated $1.5 million apiece last year , while Coopers ' 5,200 partners averaged $1.3 million . <p> Andersen 's partners , to be sure , did better . They averaged $3.6 million apiece , largely because their revenue base was spread over a much smaller base of 2,611 partners . <p> " We wanted control over our own destinies , " Mr. Moore said . The combined firms will be able to pool their resources to make the needed investments in their businesses . <p> The firms will no doubt have to handle other conflicts as well in combining their practices , and there is bound to be some shake-out as partners , even whole practices , decide whether they want to stay with the firm . The combination of Ernst &; Young back in 1989 almost cost the joint firm the long-term business of Coca-Cola , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because Pepsico was a client of Arthur Young . Ernst &; Young dropped Pepsico instead . <p> Also , while the firms claim to share a common culture and philosopy , the merged entity will have to surmount perceived differences among the two organizations . <p> " I 'm surprised at the merger , " said Howard M. Schilit , an accounting professor who is president of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis in Rockville , Md . " Price Waterhouse always tried to create a special image that there was Price Waterhouse and then there was everybody else . They relished being different from the others . " <p> He said that Price Waterhouse even had its own version of the auditor 's report that appears in the financial statements of each audited client company . Price Waterhouse 's version is often one paragraph , he said , instead of the three standardized paragraphs used by other firms . <p> " Each of the firms have a very special culture and it will be difficult to merge the two together , " Mr. Schilit said . <p> Industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's largest players will see continued consolidation . " I would expect this to be the last of the mergers , " said Peter Knudsen , an accounting professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania . <p> By his reckoning , Arthur Andersen , has been the subject of a divisive battle between the firm 's consultants and auditors over control of the organization , and is busy getting its own house in order , while KPMG Peat Marwick already has a strong global presence . <p> The most likely possibility , analysts said , might be among firms like Deloitte &; Touche and Ernst &; Young , both of whom pursued their respective mergers precisely to gain some heft and are now once again faced with being the smallest among the big firms . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : September 23 , 1997 , Tuesday <p> CORRECTION : A front-page article on Friday about a proposed combination of Coopers &; Lybrand and Price Waterhouse misspelled the surname of an accounting professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who commented .
