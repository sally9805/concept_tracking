THE GRIFTERS <P> Directed by Stephen Frears <P> Screenplay by Donald E. Westlake <P> When Jim Thompson died in 1977 , he was broken and damn near broke . Not one of his 29 novels  --  tough stuff with titles like Savage Night and A Swell- Looking Babe  --  was in print . He had fiddled on the fringes of Hollywood , helping to write Stanley Kubrick 's The Killing and Paths of Glory , but found no steady work . His one solace was booze , in punishing quantities . No wonder the typical Thompson antihero was a smart guy who got outsmarted by fate , fast company or himself . <P> In his final days Thompson promised his wife that he would be " famous after I 'm dead about 10 years . " Now he is . His reputation as a hard-boiled novelist is within spitting distance of Hammett 's and Chandler 's . And finally , Hollywood has discovered the man who wanted desperately to be in the movies . Three Thompson novels have recently become films : James Foley 's broody After Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stephen Frears ' The Grifters . <P> The Grifters is the gem  --  small , cold , bright , brilliantly crafted . The movie traces the slug tracks of three con artists who play their deadliest tricks on one another . Roy Dillon ( John Cusack ) works the " short con , " using loaded dice and legerdemain to skin cashiers and sailors . Roy 's girlfriend Myra ( Annette Bening ) is cheaper , perkier , ever ready to try the " long con "  --  the elaborate scheme that takes suckers for big stakes . Roy 's mother Lilly ( Anjelica Huston ) is the con woman supreme . Abused and abusing since girlhood , she can stand up to her sadistic boss or pull off a motel-room kill , and do it all with a hard smirk . Roy hardly stands a chance with Lilly . He can rebuff her seductions , but he ca n't duck her wrath . <P> The book was minor Thompson , lacking the snaky obsession of The Killer Inside Me or A Hell of a Woman . And Frears has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small and twisted for sympathy ; its pace is too studied , a little too in awe of its artfulness , to pack a wallop . It needs to move , but does n't , at the pace a bus-station reader would devour a paperback thriller . <P> Best to savor The Grifters for its handsome design  --  the picture looks as clean as a Hockney landscape  --  and its juicy performances . Huston and Bening , sure shots for Oscar nominations , make for two splendid carnivores ; they both have scintillating street wit and legs that go on for days . Cusack , as the would-be lion tamer , naturally gets devoured . And a swell sight it is too , a mother consuming her young , for the same reason a mama scorpion does : she 's hungry . That 's Jim Thompson 's world , and now Hollywood is welcome to it . R.C.
