IN THE LADY 'S GARDEN lived three unicorns . They were all old  --  Lady , garden , and unicorns  --  having been there from the beginning of things . The garden was kept from the sight of the World by a very large stone wall which was overgrown with spindly weeds and thistles , and hairy moss plugging up the chinks . <p> When the sun shone down , the unicorns liked to lie under the apple tree , which was the oldest thing of all in the garden . Its branches hung down to the ground , gnarled and misshapen , but covered with the most delicious red apples the year round . <p> When it rained , which was an hour every other day and twice on Tuesdays , regular as clockwork , the unicorns would stay in the stone barn , snugged together in the sweet-smelling hay . The patter on the barn roof then took on a soporific rhythm , and often the unicorns would doze and dream . Their dreams were always about running over great green swards , the wind through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed  --  or even she napped  --  no one knew for sure , for she only spoke of waking things : tide and sun and wind and rain and the changing of seasons . <p> On one side of the garden was , as I have said , the World . On the other was the Great Ocean . It was the Ocean 's tide which was often the subject of the Lady 's discourse . And though she may have thought any trouble to the garden would come to it from the World 's side , it was the Ocean that did , in the end , bring about her direst time . <p> Now , though the unicorns were all terribly old , they were not the same age . The oldest was Wishart , whose skin was almost translucent ; it was a kind of pearly white , like the inside of certain shells . When he walked  --  and he never ran  --  he moved with an ancient grace . His breath studied musty , like a bowl of crushed flower petals . He rarely listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The second oldest was Tartary . Her skin was like vellum and looked brittle but was n't . In fact it was as soft as an infant 's and smelled that sweet . sour infant smell , as if talc and sour milk had been mixed together . Tartary listened only to the Lady 's voice . <p> The third oldest  --  they called her Infants when they called her anything at all  --  still had a bit of spirit to her walk , and a bit of flint in her amber eyes . Even her horn was still the gold of new-minted coins , while the other unicorns had horns more like the color of the full moon . <p> If Wishart listened only to the sound of the Ocean , and Tartary listened only to the Lady , Infants heard the sounds of the earth growing : grass and leaves and timothy in the fields . She could distinguish between oak and ash on the rise , though the sound of rowan growing made her tremble all over . <p> And the Lady ? She was old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were once the deep , rich blue of a Spring sky and were now faded like the skies over Winter . <p> Now the way that trouble came to the garden was this . It was a small thin &; but the Lady should have known that small things carry the greatest dangers . Did n't a tiny viper bite the heel of the hero and bring him low ? Did n't ants tunnel through the great walls of Cathay and grind whole sections to dust ? <p> For the first time in years  --  in centuries , actually  --  there was a strange sound outside one of the gates in the wall . Those gates , normally so overgrown with bramble hedge and briar on the World 's side and so besieged by the Ocean on the other , needed no guards or wards . In fact , the Lady and the unicorns scarcely remembered from one year to the next that the gates existed . But this one lambent spring day , right after the hour 's rain , there was something rather like the wailing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly like the wailing of a discontented child . The wailing went on from the moment the rain ended until quite past tea time , or about three hours . At that point , Infanta stomped three times with her left fore foot and shook her head until the white mane flew about as light as milkweed milk . <p> " What is that noise ? " she asked . <p> Neither Tartary  --  who listened to the Lady  --  or Wishart  --  who listened only to the sea  --  bothered to answer . But Infanta asked anyway . " It is louder than grass growing . Louder than a gully full of Queen Anne 's Lace and campion . Louder even than the bursting open of marigolds , which is very loud , indeed . " And she went to complain directly to the Lady , who had heard the sound already . <p> " If I did n't know any better , " said the Lady , " I would say it is a child - and a very young child at that  --  lying in a reed basket washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Lady was blessed with a certain amount of prescience , which is another way of saying she could see a bit into the future , Infanta knew exactly what they would find . <p> The Lady sent one of her most trusted winds to leap over the wall and report back . It was a very small wind , hardly more than a breeze , really . When it returned , it reported in a voice made sweet with baby 's breath and tart with brine . " It is a very young child lying in a basket . " <p> " A reed basket , " the Lady said , a great deal of satisfaction in her voice . <p> " Well , nettles and linen , actually , " the breeze answered . Breezes , for all they are lightweight , insist on being factual . It is the habit of preachers and politicians as well . <p> The Lady made a face at the breeze . She hated making any kind of mistake . But then she smiled at the breeze because it had , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then the Lady instructed slightly larger breezes to waft their gauzy shifts together and make a rope to hook through the handles of the basket . In this way the child was raised up and over the wall and into the garden proper . <p> And that , you see , was the Beginning of the End . <p> THE CHILD was a boy . That was evident at once . And he was hungry . That , too , was evident . But whose child he was or why he was there at all , those questions could not be answered , not even by the Lady . Indeed those questions were never to be answered , but by tea time the next day it did n't matter because by then they were all thoroughly besotted with him . <p> Infanta was the first to fall under his spell , when he raised his little hand up to her mane and tangled his chubby fingers in it . <p> The next to fall was Tartary . " He has , " she cooed to the Lady , " your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , though not really hearing him , for certainly the baby did not have the Lady 's voice at all , hers being low and rounded and full , and his just being full . <p> Wishart actually held out the longest , until the breezes lifted the child onto his back . The baby crowed his delight , and if you could at that moment have seen the look in Wishart 's old pearly eyes , you would have been sure they had turned to oceans themselves . He trotted around the inner path , past the herb gardens , stepping over rockery plants with a lightness he had n't shown in years . <p> The Lady changed the baby 's clothes and fed him pap she mixed herself , and wiped both his face and his bottom as if that were something she had always wanted to do . And she sang to him as she cleaned , songs like " Dance to Thy Daddy , My Little Laddie , " and " Trot , Trot to Boston , " which had n't even been invented yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Eventually , after months of squabbling , they settled on Waverly as his name . <p> " Because the waves brought him , " the Infanta said , looking down fondly into his crib . <p> As long as Waverly was a baby and then a child , there was no trouble in the Lady 's garden . After all , except for uprooting some of the slighter plants  --  to see what held them to the ground  --  Waverly was a good boy , if overly curious . Of course curiosity was not something either the Lady or the unicorns really understood . But they realized , if somewhat begrudgingly , that curiosity would serve young Waverly in his education , and so they did not stifle it . <p> By the time he was ten and had gone through " What 's that ? " and " Why 's that ? " and on to " Why not ? " however , they had all begun to lose patience with him . With their sense of time , it seemed that only yesterday they had drawn baby Waverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages and ages earlier . <p> Where , they wondered , is the sweet-smelling , charming , compliant infant we fell in love with ? And who is this loud , boisterous , dirty boy who has taken his place ! And slowly , though they certainly did n't mean to , they all fell out of love with him . Just a little . <p> Just enough . <p> Now Waverly did not know what was happening , but he certainly felt that something was . One moment everyone  --  Lady and unicorns and breezes  --  had all been lovely to him , giving him whatever he asked for and praising him . And then suddenly they said " No ! " all the time . " No , you can not make a fortress in the rockery garden . " " No , you can not put a house up in the apple tree . " " No , you can not scale the wall . " " No , you can not . . . must not . . . shall not . . . may not ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exciting or dangerous . <p> So Waverly did what every child at ten does . He did it all anyway . <p> Neither the Lady nor the unicorns knew the slightest thing about giving out punishments . It was not in their makeup . So they did what they had done before Waverly had ever arrived . Wishart started listening only to the sound of the sea . Tartary , listened only to the Lady 's voice . Infanta listened only to the sounds of the earth growing . And the Lady  --  she worked in the garden , she kept the great house clean , and she spoke to Waverly only when forced to . When forced to say , once again , " No ! " <p> So it should not have been surprising  --  though it was  --  that on the morning of Waverly 's sixteenth birthday ( or at least the morning of the anniversary of the sixteenth year he had been drawn up out of the sea ) they were all awakened by the sound of loud chopping . When they got out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had just finished cutting down the apple tree and hollowing it into a boat . <p> " A boat ? " the Lady asked for she knew right away what he was doing , her prescience working as well as her eyes . " And where did you learn about boats ? " <p> " Where I learned about the Ocean and where I learned about the World , " Waverly answered sensibly . " In your library . " <p> " But the apple tree is the oldest thing of all , " the Lady said . <p> " And I am the newest , " Waverly said . " Would you have had me make a boat from stone ? " <p> " We would n't have you make a boat at all , " the Lady said . " Would we ? " she asked the unicorns . <p> Wishart did not answer , for he was listening only to the sea which was issuing a strange siren call . Tartary did not answer , for she was waiting for the Lady 's answer . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple tree . <p> Still , they did n't stop the boy , because he was already halfway through building the boat . And besides , they did n't know how . <p> It took him three days to make the boat and rig a sail , just as he had seen in one of the books in the Lady 's library . And that very night , without so much as a goodbye , he was gone with the boat over the wall . They had no idea how he had managed ; they had no idea he was so resourceful . <p> The Lady mourned his leaving in her own way , digging up plants and moving them about , the autumn crocuses three times until they died from all the changes . <p> Tartary and Infanta wandered disconsolately about , their heads so low they plowed furrows in the soil with their horns . But for the longest time , it looked as if Wishart had n't even noticed the boy was gone . He just listened , ever more intently , at the Northeastern gate to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gale blowing out upon the Ocean , Wishart roused in a sudden and inexplicable fury and beat upon the gate with his feet and plunged his horn again and again into the wood . At last the gate broke open from the savage attack , swung wide , and in rushed the angry sea . <p> The waters covered the garden and the house . The Lady and the unicorns were swept away in a great swirl of foam as pearly white as horn . And after the waters settled again , all that could be seen was the topmost part of the Southwestern gate , the one closest to the World . And there , at low tide ever after , a black-backed gull sat , turning its head curiously at each passing breeze . <p> Of course that is not entirely the end of the story . I could not bear if that were so . Wishart and Tartary and Infanta became the very first narwhales , of course , those wonderful sleek whales with the long , twisting single horns . <p> The Lady built a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright anemones clinging to coral beds , like rockeries . <p> And Waverly , in the shape of a porpoise , comes to visit them every day and twice on Tuesdays , as regular as clockwork . Or so I like to think . And since this is my story , that is the way of it . If you think there is a different ending , you will have to tell it yourself . <p> <p> By Jane Yolen <p> In 1993 , Jane Yolen published her 140th book . It was a particularly good year for her .
