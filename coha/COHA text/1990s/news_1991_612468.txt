<p> Last season , baseball commissioner Fay Vincent expressed concern about the Atlanta Braves , citing , among other things , their lack of fan support and the threat of becoming a made-for-TV team . With the Braves on the threshold of the National League pennant , he talked of these and other matters with staff writer Joe Strauss . <p> Q. With the Braves in the playoffs a year after finishing last , what are your thoughts about their turnaround ? <p> A. I think people in the Atlanta management recognized there was a serious problem . Attendance was very poor and there was just malaise . But Stan Kasten and Bill Bartholomay - and I suppose Ted Turner was involved - they brought John Schuerholz down , which was a very good decision . Everybody is focused on the right things . They obviously got a little lucky because the people they brought in had spectacular years . . . . The team played well , which got the city enthused and the attendance started to pick up . I do n't think there is anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interesting team with lots of good players and they get competitive , the fans will come out . When the team is not playing well , they wo n't come out . But I knew from all my years I was at Coca-Cola that there were a lot of people there who loved baseball . . . . I think bringing John down made a big difference . John had a strategy . <p> Q. Do you think anything has changed since your remarks questioning what purpose the club actually served Turner Broadcasting , that it was becoming , in effect , " studio sport " ? <p> A. I think everybody recognizes a baseball team has to generate attendance . It ca n't be principally related to television . We do n't like baseball seen essentially as programming , and I do n't think the Braves were really looked on in that way . But it was tempting to look at the Braves as being so intertwined with the superstation . And now it 's clear the focus is right . It 's on getting the city and fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Superstation as well . <p> Q. In hindsight , would you have handled Otis Nixon 's violation of his drug aftercare program differently by not allowing him a second chance after testing positive for cocaine use ? <p> A. If I knew then what I know now I might have done something differently . But in the situation that was in front of me this summer , I would do it again . That is , I think people are entitled to a chance . We believed Nixon when he came in . He told us that he was not taking the drug and the simple fact is he was probably lying to us . But his record had been so good in Montreal . I thought there was very little risk in giving him a break . That 's not my style , by and large , to shy away from making a tough decision in a disciplinary case . I think my record is pretty good . On the other hand , I do n't think there 's anything wrong with giving a man a break . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the drug , the test would show up very quickly . The surprising thing is that he was clean during August , according to the tests , and got in trouble in September . Looking back on it , the most important thing is not the pennant race or baseball . The most important thing was Otis Nixon . My judgment was even if he was taking the drug , he might have just slipped once . It might have just been one of those one-time-over-the-line and he came back . He knew what the circumstances were . I gave him a break at his strong request , and as it turned out he could n't handle the problem . . . . I guess I do n't have any real regrets about it . <p> Q. How do you respond to the critics , some within the Dodgers ' organization , who suggest allowing Nixon a second chance unfairly assisted the Braves during a pennant race ? <p> A. I thought the fact that some of the criticism came from the Dodgers was really inappropriate . To say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been aware that if I did it would hurt the Dodgers seems small-minded . The question was what was right for Nixon given what we had and given the fact that he had tested clean in Montreal some 200-plus times . There was a doctor testifying and the union . There were lots of reasons to give him a chance . I do n't think it 's my position to focus on what this is going to mean to the pennant race . If he had stayed clean , everybody would have been rejoicing that the guy was still meeting his obligations . <p> Q. How is this going to affect your decision in future cases ? <p> A. I would say it 's probably going to be harder to persuade me to give people a break in those circumstances . Once you test positively it means you 're back on the drug . It will be somewhat harder to persuade me . Then again , I doubt very much you will again get a case where you get that situation . But I thought the Dodgers , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were being selfish . <p> Q. How realistic is realignment , given the upcoming expansion , and what are the chances that each league will be divided into three divisions , thereby creating an extra round of playoffs ? <p> A. I think realignment , particularly for Atlanta , has to be looked at . . . and it will be looked at . <p> Q. And about adding a third division with each league ? <p> A. To some extent , that 's a revenue-driven issue . At the moment , one would have to be skeptical . It does n't make sense in the short term . There 's no reason to do that from a baseball point of view . The only reason to do that is from a business point of view , which means television . Given the circumstances , I do n't know if it makes a lot of sense . I think if there was an additional round of playoffs , it would be cable-oriented . And that raises a lot of political issues . People get upset with playoff games on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , if the over-the-air situation is what it is and the networks are n't as interested , then the future of baseball on television is going to be much more strongly cable than people are going to like . But economics drive these things . It 's not a matter of sentiment or philosophy . <p> Q. How do you evaluate franchise relocation ? <p> A. Seattle is an issue . I hope we 're going to be able to keep the team where it is . I do n't think any other solution is really attractive . I do n't like franchise transfers . I 've never believed that 's the right course . You ca n't say never because I suppose I can envision a circumstance where it will have to happen . But I really do n't think it 's in baseball 's interest to have teams move , particularly when attendance is up 700,000 in Seattle . People there are supporting the team and I 'm trying to support Seattle . I want the team to stay . <p> Q. What is your overview of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your term ? <p> A. Personally , it 's been a much better year because we did n't have any of the major traumas . It 's not over yet , either . But the first year with Bart Giamatti 's death , we had to deal with Pete Rose , and the second year with George Steinbrenner , those were really difficult , unpleasant , unsatisfying times . This year the attendance record is very satisfying .
