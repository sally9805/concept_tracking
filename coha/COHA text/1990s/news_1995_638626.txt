<p> Doctors and insurance companies are squaring off in the delivery room - and the result is no bundle of joy . <p> As managed care infiltrates the health system and medicine becomes a function of the bottom line , hospital stays for childbirth are getting shorter . Twenty-five years ago a woman who had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery could expect to stay in the hospital four days ; in 1992 the average was 2.1 days , according to a federal study . <p> In 1995 , that number is dropping even more . <p> For example , most maternity patients at University Hospital - both those on Medicaid and private insurance - stay about 20 hours after delivery , said a spokeswoman . <p> The average childbirth stay at St. Joseph Hospital in Denver - which delivers one of every 10 babies in Colorado , more than 5,000 a year - is 16-18 hours . That average includes women who have had Caesarean sections , and they generally stay longer , which means that women with uncomplicated vaginal deliveries go home in less than 16 hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health insurance firm is giving serious consideration to an after-delivery stay of 12 hours , according to a doctor who serves on the company 's advisory board . <p> And there are reports in California that a Kaiser Permanente affiliate has started encouraging moms and newborns to leave just eight hours after childbirth . <p> Not everyone agrees with the trend , especially doctors and patients . But while some physicians criticize shorter hospital stays as bad medicine with potentially disastrous results , insurance companies say they 're making sound decisions - both economic and medical . <p> " Our physicians are responsible for deciding ( when to release ) , and there 's no requirement , only guidelines , " said Dr. Val Dean , vice president of medical affairs for FHP health insurance . That guideline is 24 hours after a normal vaginal delivery , 72 hours after a Caesarean section , he said . <p> " But if there is a medical reason to keep her or the baby in , we do , " he said . <p> He said FHP has no plans to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomplicated deliveries usually go home between 24 and 36 hours , said Dr. Neil Kesselman , a pediatrician and president-elect of the local chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics . Women who 've had C-sections stay about three days . <p> Home visit by nurse <p> A couple of days later , Kaiser patients get a 45-minute home visit from a registered nurse who checks mom and baby and addresses breastfeeding problems and other newborn care questions . <p> " The key is for the team - from the OB side and the pediatric side - to negotiate , " said Kesselman . " We 're flexible , and I do n't think anyone is watching individual decisions made by doctors , " he said . <p> He 's an advocate of shorter stays . <p> " I think moms and babies benefit , and I think Kaiser benefits " by releasing maternity patients in 24-36 hours , said Kesselman . " Everybody does better in a more relaxed environment . " <p> But he does n't agree with the prospect of what some critics are calling " drive-through deliveries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I feel OK with , in the case of a second-time or low-risk mom , but I wo n't do it at a bad time . For example , if a baby is born at 8 a.m. , I would n't send them home 12 hours later , at 8 p.m. , " said Kesselman . " But personally , I 'm nervous about anything less than 12 hours ( after delivery ) . " <p> Insurance factor <p> Insurance maternity policies do n't always coincide with actual patient stays . Some women say they feel rushed to go home before they 're ready , and the hospital average stay is less than what most insurers say they authorize . <p> Despite the contention of insurers that the rules are only guidelines and that doctors choose when to send a woman home , a Denver obstetrician said that physicians " do n't make the decisions . " <p> " We have zero control over it , " said Dr. Gerald Zarlengo . " It 's gotten so bad that I ca n't even keep in a woman with a C-section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spike . Insurance says , ' Let 's send her home and see if she spikes ( a fever ) , you can readmit her , " ' said Zarlengo . <p> When he hears reports of insurance plans considering even shorter stays for new moms , Zarlengo worries . <p> " I 'm terrified that we 're going to press this until a disaster happens , " he said . <p> Dr. Richard Allen , director of obstetrics/gynecology residency education at St. Joseph Hospital , said many physicians are concerned that insurance companies increasingly are dictating medical decisions . But if they try to fight the insurance companies , they 're " blacklisted , or kicked around " by the company and may have trouble keeping patients who are insured by that firm , he said . <p> Reports of ' deals ' <p> Other OBs tell stories of patients who are offered " deals " by their insurance companies : If they get out of the hospital in under 24 hours , insurance will pick up 100 percent of the cost of delivery , even if the patient normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those kinds of deals influence patients and doctors to make decisions based only on finances , and not on what 's best for moms and babies , said Allen . <p> " When to release absolutely should be a medical decision , " said Zarlengo . " And we 're losing sight of that . " <p> Zarlengo said that as women are " swept through " maternity wards faster , " they 're not getting the education they need , in breast-feeding and baby care . They take mom 's temp and her blood pressure and she 's out the door , " he said . <p> " And we do n't live in a society where they have support at home , or a relative to teach them that , " he said . <p> Kaiser officials counter that their policy of a postpartum nursing visit helps a new mom with that support and teaching . A pediatric nurse practitioner who does those visits said she believes early discharge " is a great idea . " <p> " A hospital is not a great place to recover , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all the family dynamics are changing , it 's important for the parents to get to know this baby , " and they can do that better at home , she said . <p> Even critics of mandated short stays agree that women should have the option of going home earlier . <p> " When I started practicing nine years ago , we kept women three days , and that was too much . Two is good , " said Zarlengo . <p> " I 'm sure in the past there have been excesses and overutilization ( of insurance benefits ) , and it was wasteful , " added Allen . " But now the pendulum has swung too far the other way . " <p> In the middle of the debate are moms . Some are relieved to get home as soon after delivery as possible ; others beg for extra time . <p> " I 've had ladies plead with me to let them stay another day , " said Zarlengo . <p> Judi Piccone of Englewood , who had her daughter , Marie , 13 months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital an extra day . While she was in the hospital , the baby would fall asleep when she tried to breastfeed . Piccone expressed concern , but said doctors told her she was ready to go home . <p> " I did n't feel ready , but they 're the professionals - you believe them , " she said . <p> Piccone was dismissed about 34 hours after delivery , exhausted and sore . The baby continued to have problems nursing . Three days later , when she went seven hours without feeding and was lethargic , the Piccones took her to the emergency room . Marie was diagnosed with severe dehydration and rushed to Children 's Hospital by ambulance , where she spent 2 1/2 days in the neonatal intensive care unit . <p> " Had they kept us in the hospital one more day , I think they would have caught ( the feeding problems ) , " she said . " And I think it would 've helped me , " added Piccone , whose incision ripped and delayed her own recovery . <p> " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me furious , " she said . " I think you should be able to stay a minimum of two days , especially a first-time mom . " <p> News reports from other states have told of women timing contractions in hospital parking lots so they could fit delivery into a less-than-24-hour stay . Allen agreed that " most labor and delivery nurses are familiar with when the ( insurance ) clock starts . If a woman comes in at 11 p.m. , they may tell her to go walk around for an hour and come back to check in at midnight . " <p> While physicians , patients and insurors continue to lock horns on the issue , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is looking to Congress for help . The organization supports federal legislation that has been introduced in both the House and Senate that would mandate insurers to cover a 48-hour stay for moms who 've had a vaginal birth and 96 hours for a C-section . <p> But there are few , if any , studies to back up either the short-stay or mandated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdotal reports of problems in newborns , such as dehydration and undetected jaundice , following early discharge . " <p> Kaiser 's Kesselman , however , said he does n't know where ACOG came up with the 48-hour recommendation , nor does he see " how insurance companies can mandate a time period . " <p> The ob/gyn group says arbitrarily imposing short stays on new moms " could be equivalent to a large , uncontrolled , uninformed experiment that may potentially affect the health of American women and their babies . " <p> Meanwhile , patients like Judi Piccone may take matters into their own hands . <p> " I think this has all become a money issue , and they 're not looking at what 's best for the mom and baby , " she said . " My husband and I have decided , with our next child , I 'll stay an extra day , no matter what it costs . We 're not going to compromise our child 's health . <p> " WHAT TO DO <p> Women who are uncomfortable about being released too soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Dr. Richard Allen , director of OB/GYN residency program at St. Joseph Hospital , said doctors often " get harassed " by insurance companies when they try to extend a stay for a patient , and they do occasionally end up doing battle with insurance companies to override the decision . <p> " Eventually , a doctor may get through to the medical director , and ask the company to put their decision in writing for the patient 's attorney , " he said . " Then we usually can negotiate . But I do n't think that 's appropriate to have to do that . " Allen said if a woman 's insurance is purchased by her employer , " she can complain to the benefits manager " about her negative experience with the company . <p> An advocacy group called the Washington Feminist Faxnet advises women to contact their legislators to co-sponsor Senate Bill 969 , " The Newborns ' and Mothers ' Health Protection Act , " and House Concurrent Resolution 79 , which would mandate minimum stays after childbirth . <p> INSURANCE POLICIES <p> Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health insurers : <p> Blue Cross/Blue Shield : 24-36 hours for a normal vaginal delivery , 72 hours after a Caesarean section . <p> FHP : 24 hours after a normal vaginal delivery , 72 hours after a Caesarean section , with doctors making the final decision . <p> Kaiser Permanente of Colorado : Patients with uncomplicated vaginal deliveries go home between 24 and 36 hours ; C-section patients stay " about three days . " <p> " Guidelines for Perinatal Care , " a collaborative document of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and American Academy of Pediatrics , recommends a postpartum stay of at least 48 hours for vaginal deliveries , and 96 hours for C-sections , exclusive of the day of delivery .
