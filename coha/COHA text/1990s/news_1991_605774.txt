<p> Great crappiness is essentially American . <p> - Paul Fussell <p> Gripe . Gripe . Crab . Crab . There are so many things Paul Fussell does n't like . So many ! Sitting on his high stool at the Willard bar , he seems rotten and resistant  --  at first . Just a grumpy academic , perhaps , pompous and brooding and irritable and potentially hurtful . The social critic . The English professor . Bent over his wineglass , he looks like the aging offspring of Ernest Hemingway and the Grinch Who Stole Christmas . <p> His eyes rove the room . Booth to booth . Stranger to stranger . He has opinions about everything . Drifting from subject to subject , he tackles the heavyweight to the ridiculous . He talks about his World War II experiences , American restaurant food , men 's facial hair and toupees , Californians , the 18th century , plastic surgery , Fleet Street , George Orwell and why he hates to see a beautiful woman eating french fries . He nods his head toward one such example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " Look at her ! She is n't eating them now , but she was . I want to rush over to her and say , Madam ! Stop ! " <p> But french fries are good ! <p> " I know they 're good , " he says , " but she could ruin herself . Her figure ! " <p> His new book , " BAD or , The Dumbing of America , " is sort of a downer too , a nasty one-note $ 19 diatribe , but wait ... there 's a constant smile on his face . His watery eyes turn up sweetly at the outside corners , like cat glasses . His hair is dry and shaggy , and he has n't bothered to comb it super-carefully . His book is an appalling onslaught of All-Things-Appalling , but he has ... a wonderful way of talking , whispering . He 's droll and playful . He 's quick to laugh , but never at his own jokes . <p> The ugly truth begins to rear its head : Paul Fussell is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabs some ice with his fingers and plops it in his chardonnay . <p> Fussell , 67 , has been moaning about the loss of civility in Modern Life for years now  --  when he 's not distracted by his own thoughts on world war or the 18th century . For the rich , especially , life seems to have taken a horrible turn . It 's a tad depressing , this **26;620;TOOLONG feeling . Oh , the foul popularity of polyester . Oh , oh , the mediocrity of ocean liners these days . Oh , oh , oh , those advertisements for Greek fishermen 's caps in the New Yorker . <p> At the Occidental Grill , he squeezes into a banquette . " Squeeze " is the operative word here , because the tufted leather seat is too close to the table , which is nearly pressing against his barrel chest . The table is also too high . He 's a tall fellow , but now dwarfed : His head just barely floats over his chicken sandwich . <p> " This booth , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fussell , " BAD " things are different from things that are merely " bad , " which is to say merely " not good . " <p> " BAD " is something " phony , clumsy , witless , untalented , vacant , or boring that many Americans can be persuaded is genuine , graceful , bright , or fascinating , " he says in his book . " Lawrence Welk is a low example , George Bush a high . " <p> BADness is pretension , affectation . BADness is unconsciously accepting form over substance , status over service , artificiality over authenticity . The book is set up encyclopedically . It begins with BAD advertising , BAD airports , BAD banks ... and moves on to BAD colleges , BAD food , BAD ideas , BAD magazines and BAD newspapers , BAD movies , BAD poetry , BAD public sculpture , BAD television . <p> BAD is essentially everything in life that Paul Fussell hates . Behavior-wise , BAD is wearing a beeper to a party , bringing a camcorder to a public event , giving your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being too friendly to strangers , interrupting people in conversation , talking about the novel you 're writing . <p> It 's also the forced applause of a TV game show audience . It 's the colorizing of black-and-white movies . It 's the homemade signs displayed at sports events . It 's astrology too , and UFO sightings , men 's diamond pinkie rings , Waterford crystal-handled razors , collections of porcelain thimbles , anything sold by the Franklin Mint , magazines like Connoisseur , the space shuttle Challenger . <p> Yes , he dares mention that . <p> He writes : " The American achievement  --  I know it 's bad taste to mention this  --  is the Challenger , brought to you by faulty manufacture , inept and dishonest quality control , and lying and evasion for the sake of big bucks . " <p> He is not English . He just seems like it . But he and his wife , Harriette Behringer ( they met in 1982 , when she wrote to him after his last Style profile ran ) , have been living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief departure from his regular gig at the University of Pennsylvania . <p> And " BAD , " he 'd like you to know , was not written while suffering an uncontrollable bout of Anglophilia . " That 's a vulgar error , " he says . " I could have written this book when I was 5 years old if I 'd had the time . I was seeing all this then . ... <p> " I did n't just go to England and look back at the United States with contempt and effuse my bile , " he says . " No-no-no . I wrote it before I left . And I 'd been working on it for three or four years . I 'd been keeping a file of things  --  alphabetically , actually  --  on things that annoyed me , or things I thought I could be funny about shooting down . And gradually that became the little chapterettes , from A to Z. " <p> BAD Words Words he hates : breathtaking , controlled substance , Corinthian leather , gourmet , lifestyle , luxurious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wellness , world-renowned . <p> The BAD City Washington suffers in his book , by the way . It heads Fussell 's list of " BAD cities , " and is followed by miserable places like Atlantic City , Las Vegas , Miami and Tampa . <p> " It 's BAD in New York as well , " he says , " but it 's more glitzy- and show biz-BAD . In Washington it 's middle-class-BAD , I 'd say . Terrible people from Kansas trying to come on as aristocrats , you know . Did you read the nasty things I wrote about embassy personnel ? They are like field-grade officers just obeying orders . Gentlemen never obey orders ! <p> " Washington is filled with that kind of thing  --  people like Ollie North pretending to be gentlemen , pretending to be independent . But he 's nothing but an employee . Just a cheap little employee , you know ? " <p> More BADness exists here . Washington , he writes , " feels obliged to present itself as a locus of taste and sophistication , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-rate newspaper complete with horoscopes and funnies ... and virtually no literary life . " <p> National Airport is " another horror . " The " lifelike " sculptures added to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial ruined its " throatcatching understatement and simplicity . " The monuments are not BAD , he says , but the Kennedy Center is . <p> What 's the difference between campy and BAD ? <p> " Campy knows that it 's BAD , " Fussell says . " BAD thinks it 's good . Unfortunately , there 's almost no audience for campy architecture here in Washington . I mean , there 's no audience that 's capable of making that distinction , as there is in New York  --  where a lot of people easily perceive that the Statue of Liberty is camp . Pure camp . Kitsch . There are many things like that in Washington , but what Washington lacks is an audience of subversive wits . " <p> The Gripes of Academe A couple more books and they 'll be calling Paul Fussell a national institution , America 's own Jonathan Swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters , after all . He 's got a PhD from Harvard in English literature . He 's taught at Rutgers and Connecticut College and the University of Pennsylvania , and paid his academic dues with works like " The Theory of Prosody in Eighteenth-Century England . " <p> There was also " The Rhetorical World of Augustan Humanism : Ethics and Imagery From Swift to Burke . " <p> But let 's face it , he 's got the soul of a migrant feature writer . A gentleman journalist . A bit of lit-crit , some social observations , cultural history , autobiography and a dash of slapstick . <p> " I love to annoy my colleagues every now and then , " he says , " by putting out a book like ' BAD ' when I 'm supposed to be writing about George Orwell or Alexander Pope or somebody respectable that nobody 's paid enough attention to . I like to wake them up now and then , by indicating that I 'm interested in something other than the little university . " <p> Has n't he been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that world , " says Fussell  --  who has been teaching " The Age of Pope " and " The Age of Samuel Johnson , " among other things , at Penn for nearly a decade now . " But it 's just not sufficient for me . It 's too easy  --  once you 've learned your subject and become an authority in it . You just ride on that and do n't have to learn anything new . I 've always been very impatient about doing the same thing twice . If I 've done it once , I get sick of it and want to move on . ... <p> " University people are so stupid in this country , " he continues . " I do n't find that they are great readers of books , as a matter of fact , or great entertainers of new ideas . They lack curiosity . " <p> Fussell first wandered away from the 18th century in the early ' 70s , after writing " Samuel Johnson and the Life of Writing . " A foray into the open library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something new to learn  --  resulted in his award-winning book " The Great War and Modern Memory , " published in 1975 . <p> " There were shelves and shelves of books about World War I , " he says . " And I thought , that 's a good subject . Because I know more about that sort of war than most Americans . So I read for a year or two and became absolutely fascinated . I thought there was a subject that people might be interested in . I found it really just by accident . That 's why I 'm rather in favor of open-stack libraries . They create ideas . " <p> The Lessons of War He had served in World War II as a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army  --  the 103rd Infantry Division in France and Germany  --  and won a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts . Years later he denied any heroism on his part in Publishers Weekly : " For months I was shooting adolescent boys and watching them die , because you knew if you did n't kill them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , " he says now , " is deep behind everything I do . It taught me that the public world is largely a delusion created by directors and actors and lighting men . I would read accounts of so-called battles I had been in , and they had no relation whatever to what had happened . So I began to perceive that anything written was fiction to various degrees . The whole subject  --  the difference between actuality and representation  --  was an interesting one . And that 's what brought me to literature in the first place . " <p> Two years ago , he published " Wartime : Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War , " calling it " a savage , insensate affair " that has been " sanitized and romanticized almost beyond recognition by the sentimental , the loony patriotic , the ignorant , and the bloodthirsty . " More recently , he edited " The Norton Book of Modern War . " <p> But in between war books , he wrote " Abroad : British Literary Traveling Between the Wars , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1982 there was " Thank God for the Atom Bomb and Other Essays , " in which Fussell went after optimists , puritans and the National Rifle Association , and defended the morality of dropping the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . In 1983 there was " Class , " which took on the pretensions of the bourgeoisie , and the differences among the upper class , the upper middle class , the middle class and " the proles . " A primer of taste in dress , food , housing , education and speech  --  for the masses and the classes  --  it was sort of a " U and Non-U " for Americans . <p> " Before the war , I was going to be a newspaper person , " he says . " I discovered that I could make money writing . The first thing I wrote was an essay for the Boy Scout magazine . I got $ 50 for it . That was the breakthrough . I could make money  --  and almost a career  --  by just writing my observations up , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't noted . And so , I 've done a lot of that ad hoc journalism over the years . Both popular and , sort of , quality . " <p> His next project ? " I 'm writing a book on contemporary British literary culture which includes newspapers , and largely excludes fiction ... . <p> " It 's really about the biographers and travel writers and essayists and writers of high journalistic books , which is a tradition I 'm very fond of . I began to see that the really best people in British journalism and nonfiction had never been to universities . That 's a wonderful , explosive subject for the Yanks ! So I thought I 'd do something on that . I began to do research on who had been to college and who had not , and it was astonishing . All the way from Orwell up to the present time , writers of really good nonfiction had not felt a university education to be necessary . " <p> The Yankee Refugee He 's got the gruff delivery of a boarding school Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy sat , gray flannel legs crossed patiently , in solemn New England parlors . Even when he 's wearing thick socks he seems to be wearing no socks at all . <p> But actually , he grew up in  --  visible cringe  --  Southern California . <p> Pasadena , no less . <p> " I am distinctly a refugee , " he says . " Ever since I was 21 years old , I 've lived in the East as a rebuke to California . ... My problem with it was a class problem , rather than a place problem  --  because I came from the upper middle class and never met anybody out of it . They were all fatuous people who had inherited money . Real asses . All the boys went into business . All the girls got married to morons . ... I knew one guy who went east to school , and that was all . Everybody was very self-satisfied , and wanted to work for their father 's insurance business . It was deadly . I had to get out . Just awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not even for important research for " BAD . " " It 's what 's happening to the whole country : Californication . That 's really , sort of , what BAD is all about . It 's this gloss . Everybody has become a youth-impersonator . " <p> You can drive around Los Angeles , he 's told , and see people " doing " movie stars , trying to look like them . Doing Tom Cruise . Doing Jack Nicholson . " Exactly , " he says . " I found that  --  even more than the East  --  everybody was on a movie set all the time . Terrible self-consciousness . How do I look ? Am I acting my role ? And it 's beautifully done . People my age do Ray Milland a lot . Sometimes they do  --  who 's the actor who played Ben Bradlee ? " <p> Jason Robards ? <p> " Yes , there 's a lot of that with people my age . The hooded eyes . And perfect roll in the button-down collar . " <p> Fussell 's doing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll . <p> " But when I get back to the hotel , " he says , " I 'm going to change into my bluejeans and my sweatshirt for the flight to Chicago . I refuse to go along with this airline act that it 's a big deal to fly , that you 're supposed to dress up and be dignified . ... My favorite people are the French and the Northern Italians . They now travel in warm-up suits , and sometimes in bare feet . They slop all over the place . Very comfortable . I love it . And it 's a way of treating all that pretentious airline advertising with great contempt . "
