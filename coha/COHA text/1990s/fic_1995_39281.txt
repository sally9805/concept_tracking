Lionel took off Elaine 's underwear in the yard . She 'd spread a tatty blanket over the grass and fallen onto it ; the summer sky above her was jam-packed with unknown constellations . <p> " If my parents open their curtains , they can see us , " she whispered . Lionel hesitated in undressing her ; it was freezing in the mountains , even in June , and goose bumps had risen on her stomach and chest . They 'd been drinking rum and smoking marijuana : sticky , sweet  --  like youth . They laughed about Elaine 's parents , whose bedroom window went dark a few minutes later . Their sex was heedless and exciting , as if between strangers . Afterwards , they ran to the house wearing various garments , wrapped clumsily in the damp leafy blanket , leaving Elaine 's panties in the yard , where her father found them in the morning . <p> They were a bright white ; he thought he 'd located one of his hankies . <p> Besides handkerchiefs , Elaine 's father carried other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket watch , a money clip . He belonged to the generation on its way out , one unable to wholly recover from the Depression or the Second World War , one that understood itself lucky simply to survive , a generation baffled by the whining one that followed it . <p> Some of his habits , which came with the territory , annoyed his offspring . He was cautious with money and took finances unnecessarily seriously . He did not believe gender irrelevant . Feminists made him defensive , homosexuals made him queasy , the Japanese made him nervous , addicts made him impatient , although blacks , as a rule , he felt an obligation to pity , still influenced as he was by the stretch of the 1960s and civil rights . Explosive displays within ( and without ) the family embarrassed him . He thought children should be seen rather than heard . <p> Other traits of his pleased Elaine and her siblings . For example , he had a gentleman 's chivalry and would not tolerate rudeness toward Elaine 's mother , to whom he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect his daughters . He did not want to know the inner workings of their lives , but he could not rest without assuming the general outer shape of them safe and intact . He honored the cocktail hour , and when they arrived at this house , he had waiting their favorite drinks , a margarita for Mary , red wine for Elaine , pink champagne for Dini . His son , with whom he had troubles , would drink whatever there was the most of . <p> This was the summer home , the frame house in the Rockies , the place where Elaine 's family collected to remind themselves how badly they got along , Because the house stood empty for nine months of the year , the primary activity of the summer was mending its damage : screens , plumbing , painting . The side yard had seen the weddings of three of the four siblings ; the fourth , Jonathan , seemed to be homosexual ( the sisters were still debating ; their father would have been appalled to learn what they thought ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bedrooms , adequate bath  --  but now had grown too large : three husbands , six grandchildren , a new baby on the way . The small children slept like dogs : on the couch , on the porch , on the floor . <p> Elaine 's younger sister , Dini , had appeared on the Fourth of July with her husband the misanthrope and her large belly , morosely pregnant . No one thought her ready for it . And Elaine , fearing her own unwanted , indiscreet pregnancy , sighed heavily . Had she consulted her mother , she would have been told , not for the first time , that her two sisters had been accidents . " Accidents , " her mother would say , " but not mistakes . " The oldest and the youngest , the first and the last , the unintended parentheses around Elaine and Jonathan . Her mother would have advised having the baby ; she would have extolled  --  over-extolled  --  the virtues of unplanned children . <p> Elaine , who already had a boy and a girl of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another baby , another pregnancy , knowing she would not follow through . She and her husband Lionel did n't have the requisite vigor for another child ; it would exhaust them , the way her mother 's last child , baby Dini , had exhausted her , leaving her dazed and depleted , emotionally anemic . Perhaps Elaine 's mother had realized earlier , after Jonathan came along , that the household teams were no longer evenly matched , that the parents , outnumbered , would surely lose . <p> Elaine 's youngest siblings were the closest of the grown children , separated from Elaine and her big sister , Mary , by their dependence on their parents , whom they resented because they were still financially beholden . This despite Jonathan 's being thirty years old and owner of his own business ; this despite Dini 's marriage . It did not appear that her parents lorded the situation over Dini and Jonathan , though Elaine supposed they must , unwittingly . <p> Jonathan and Dini liked to complain about their mother and father , and Elaine and Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mission to explain why they did what they did . Without Jonathan , Dini might surrender , but with Jonathan on her side , she would not relent : her father and mother were monstrous , controlling , insufferable <p> Mary , the oldest and most sentimental , had the shiny gloss of tears in her eyes ; she could n't bear their rancor , it broke her saintly heart . <p> " Why do you keep coming back to see them ? " Elaine asked them , sincerely curious . Neither had an answer , although Elaine thought she understood their vain hope : that some day their parents would grasp who they truly were , and love them anyway . <p> When he was n't egging on Dini in her tirades , Jonathan spent most of the reunion week underneath his motorcycle , either genuinely repairing it or pretending o , appearing or meals with oil on his clothing , black beneath his fingernails , an odor of machinery in his hair . Every morning , his shower lasted until the hot water turned tepid . Wearing only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunny front porch and blew his nose over the railing . Elaine 's five-year-old son was taking lessons , using his finger to close one nostril , leaning over and honking into he grass . <p> " Does n't that destroy brain cells ? " Dini asked , watching from the kitchen . Her clothes , because she refused to wear maternity outfits , strained against her body , leaving gaps , revealing her popped navel like a button . <p> Elaine said , " Women never do things like that , have you noticed. ? " <p> He was good with children , but Jonathan said he did n't want his own . Their father frowned , declaring  --  in the same peremptory tone he 'd once used to advise a military stint  --  that of course Jonathan would change his mind when the right woman came along . The sisters exchanged glances while Jonathan turned red . They liked the idea of having a gay brother . It was novel and exotic ; getting him out of the closet was their current chore , worrying about mortal disease would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friends here in Colorado ; he 'd been the popular one . A photograph of them had hung above the refrigerator forever , dimming , accumulating dust , the five boys all perched shirtless in their jeans , smoking their cigarettes , languishing on the hood of a sky-blue Mustang that had , over time , faded a radiant white . This summer Jonathan took down the photo and blew it off , then left it lying on top of the refrigerator instead of hanging on its proper nail . " They 're all dead but me , " he told Dini . <p> " How can that be ? " Elaine asked later , bewildered by the news , staring at the same photo while Dini angrily threw together dinner ; it was her turn . <p> " They were dumb fucks , " Dini told her . " I slept with three of them , " she added , and Elaine would n't give her the satisfaction of asking which three . Though she was only twenty-four years old , Dini had managed a lot of sleeping around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave , her brother 's hoodlum friends , the small-town sons , lecherous and dull , their boyish grins shining up at Elaine from over-exposed 1979 . On nights when she could n't find her own fun , she used to condescend to ride around with them , listen to their eight-track tapes , drink their Coors . The catalog of their deaths could not surprise  --  drunken drowning , high-speed car crash , overdose , elk-hunting fiasco  --  but the fatal freakish statistic of Jonathan 's survival made Elaine feel swung into another era , like his mother , his protector . <p> " Tough shit if people do n't like mushrooms , " Dini declared , dropping in handfuls of the spongy fungus . <p> " I hate mushrooms , " Elaine 's son said later , at dinner . <p> " So do I , " said Elaine 's father . <p> " Me , too , " admitted Mary and all four of her children . <p> Dini grinned , eating her own mushrooms as well as her nephew 's and father 's , watching the pushed-aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll give birth to a toadstool , " Elaine said to her . <p> " Or maybe a toad , " said Jonathan . <p> At night , they walked around town , a family parade , the children in front , the grandparents bringing up the rear . They made the same comments they made every summer , pointed out the same landmarks , disparaged the same developments , disputed the same history , misremembered the same memory . They ambled through the art galleries and they bypassed the seductive beery entryways of bars . Inside the picture window of The Silverjack sat a placid mountain lion wearing a collar and leash . <p> " That 's different , " said Elaine 's mother . <p> " I want a lion , " the children whined , hands pressed to the glass . <p> " I want a drink , " whined Dini , her hand pressed to her tummy . The mountain lion blinked lazily , her tongue curling out of her mouth for an instant , making the children jump back . <p> Longtime locals called hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went suddenly cold and the stars popped on . At home there was the bustle of baths and teethbrushing , evening wheedling and tears and the shush of pajama feet on linoleum The dining table became the bridge table , lighted like a campfire in the center of the settling , whispering dark . <p> " When are you leaving ? " asked Mary as she dealt cards . She had few talents besides caretaking . She liked to know itineraries and plans ; she had a flair for cooking huge quantities of bland food and keeping her patience long past the point when others had lost theirs . They called her Sister Mary because she was too angelic for her own good . <p> " Miss Manners advises the following phrasing , " Jonathan corrected his sister : " How long will you be able to stay ? " He was methodically scooping up bites of cold cereal , using a soup spoon and a mixing bowl instead of their ordinary counterparts . Elaine , who 'd purchased the last batch of groceries , resented her brother 's voracious appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , storing away fuel for the long winter . <p> " I 'm out of here day after tomorrow , " he continued . " Head over to Tahoe , check out the clubs . " <p> " We 're not leaving until school starts , " Elaine said . She and her sister Dini were the only ones still on academic schedules , the only ones to have the whole summer free for Ouray . " Ooh-ray , " the tourists called it ; but if you knew what you were talking about , you said " You-ray , " Elaine 's three-year-old daughter named it " My-ray . " Elaine 's parents had retired from teaching and now liked to travel around during the summers ; they were no longer comfortable in the shabby house , and they only used it as a base for their other travels : opening it up in June for a week or two , then off to Yellowstone , now back for the annual reunion , due to leave soon for San Diego . Sister Mary was a dietitian in Dallas and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned a bar in New Orleans and came and went as he pleased on his big , dangerous Harley ; and Dini was simply broke , looking for the cheapest place she and her husband could crash . <p> Mary 's husband and Dini 's husband had the same first name , Bill , which Jonathan found endlessly amusing , as the two men could n't have been more different . Mary 's Bill delivered mail and had a knack for narrating the obvious  --  " Well , here we are eating , " he would cheerfully note , or , " Guess I 'll get myself a Kleenex now " ; Dini 's Bill never said anything . He hung around in the attic bedroom with his shirt off , listening to headphones and reading library books . Thirty years old , he was a perennial graduate student , holder of three master 's degrees  --  history , philosophy , English literature  --  and no career . Elaine supposed that in a clan of teachers  --  her parents , herself , her husband  --  someone like Dini 's Bill had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody had much patience for him . All three sons-in-law , even Lionel , passed into eclipse in the presence of the larger family . Elaine could hardly recall her husband 's full personality ; he seemed lusterless and incomplete . <p> " We 'll leave with Mom and Dad on the thirteenth , " Mary let them know for the third or fourth time . All week long , the family recited the same lines , as if in rehearsal for the real performance . The thirteenth was the same day that Elaine and Lionel had set aside for a trip to Montrose , the nearest city with a clinic . They 'd asked Dini to watch their children . They would wait until everyone was gone so that they would n't have to explain their excursion : Elaine had scheduled an abortion , Lionel a vasectomy . It seemed wise to have both procedures done concurrently , a separate-but-equal ritual , a solemn ceremony of finality . <p> And they wanted to do it before their wedding anniversary , which was a few days later . They 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , but they approached the problem reasonably , maturely , Lionel finally submitting to a vasectomy after his squeamish objections of the last few years . Elaine had thought she might finish her fertile life without having to have an abortion , a luxury almost none of her friends had enjoyed , but if she had to get one , she supposed now was better than other times in her past . <p> " We have our children , " Lionel had reminded her , patting her on the back . " We 're financially solvent , our marriage is good . " But Elaine resented that paternal pat . She had n't even wanted to purchase an early pregnancy kit , since the only other times she 'd bought them were when her children had been conceived , intentionally . She 'd only had good associations with the process , the urinating in the little cup , the wait for a pink dipstick . Instead , she 'd insisted on going to the Ouray ob-gyn , who only came around every Thursday , like the Book Mobile , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Jonathan " the children called now from their dark , makeshift beds . They preferred him ; his tastes resembled their own . " Jonathan , tell us about Tommy Torso " Elaine , who was dummy , leaned away from the bridge table to listen . Out of earshot of the other adults , Jonathan conjured up Tommy Torso , the loathsome boy with no arms or legs , who propelled his skateboard with his big callused nose , a boy so gloriously ugly and unkind even his own mother did n't love him . <p> " We love him , " the children swore . " We love Tommy Torso . " <p> " Who will drive home ? " Lionel asked on the evening of the twelfth . They were whispering in bed after many games of cribbage and bridge and charades . The children had stayed up late ; popcorn had been popped , toddies poured , old record albums resurrected and played on the ancient player , Sam Hinton , Buffy Sainte-Marie , Glenn Miller . " Afterwards , neither of us will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , covering their faces with pillows so that others would n't hear . It was hopelessly hysterical . Elaine had drunk more toddies than anyone else , just to keep her mood up . She did n't want to think about tomorrow . She did n't want to feel the way she felt : wrong , as usual . <p> " Dini will have to come with us , " Lionel said . <p> " With the children ? There wo n't be anyone here to watch the children if Dini drives . " <p> " Except Bill " <p> " Right . Bill . " They laughed more , until Elaine threatened to hyperventilate , to burst into tears . Her emotional state was an explosive cocktail churning inside : hormones , guilt , liquor , fear . <p> " Bill could drive and Dini could stay here , " Lionel suggested . " I do n't want Bill to drive I think Bill is philosophically opposed to the automobile . " Elaine noticed that she was having difficulty with philosophically so she repeated it  --  " philosophically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll have to all go together , " Lionel said , pulling her close and folding her in , damping down her restlessness . " An outing . " <p> In the morning Elaine had a terrible headache even though she had n't mixed alcohols , had stayed within a single family  --  the scotch one  --  the way she 'd heard to do to avoid hangover . She felt betrayed . Downstairs , her mother was busy making beds , delegating duties to the grandchildren , opening cupboards and directing what went where , occasionally calling for one of her daughters to stir the oatmeal or check on the biscuits . This was the traditional farewell breakfast , gluey and filling . <p> " Do you know what Jonathan told me ? " Elaine 's mother said to her as they pulled plates from the cabinet , knives and spoons from the drawer . <p> Elaine 's head throbbed and her stomach roiled ; her eyes felt like rubber balls . " What did Jonathan tell you ? " <p> " He said he 'd never have children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her mother held the napkins in her barely quaking hands ; there was a time , not so long ago , when Elaine would have delighted in her mother 's distress , would have felt victorious . " Do you understand that , Elaine ? " <p> " No , Mom , I do n't . " Elaine understood it perfectly ; she 'd successfully squelched a similar feeling when she 'd decided in favor of having her own children . " Do n't think about it . " <p> " Well , of course I will . He 'd be such a good daddy , your brother . " Her mother stepped away from the real issue so dexterously Elaine was tempted to tell her the things her mother refused to know . <p> " I always wanted a slightly different kind of mom , " Dini had told Elaine the day before . " I wanted the mom who let her kids smoke and curse in front of her . " <p> " I wanted the mom who liked to go shopping , " Sister Mary had confessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids up like dolls . " <p> Elaine had hesitated ; her sisters each wanted the kind of mother they themselves were or would be . What sort of mother was she , Elaine wondered ? But the truth was that her mother was n't the only family member whose casting she would have altered . There would have been a more lax father , one less invested in the outmoded past and , as a consequence , less injured by the present , a wilder older sister who might warn her about the dark , slutty side of a girl 's life , a jock brother who could protect her in the arenas her father had no access to , and an adoring younger sibling , male or female , it did n't matter which , who liked to follow orders . But her real sisters were waiting to hear about the mother she secretly desired . " I wanted to live on a horse farm , " she finally said . " I wanted a couple of stable-hand parents . " <p> " Judy Garland , " said Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the midget , " Dini said . " Perfect . " <p> " Or maybe I wanted some glamorous academics , " Elaine speculated . " Sort of **34;62;TOOLONG . " Her parents ' academia was not Ivy League but of a commuter-college variety . <p> " Goodbye , goodbye , " Elaine 's children called to the family as the cars pulled away , caravan-style , Jonathan 's roaring motorcycle in the lead , his bandana a receding flash of red . <p> " I want a motorcycle , " Elaine 's son said , bursting into tears . " You would n't let me get even one ride " he accused Elaine . <p> " I miss my grandma , " said the three-year-old , also beginning to sob <p> Everyone felt tragic ; disbanding made them think of death , Elaine supposed , its chilly guarantee falling now like a vapor <p> " Who wants to go on a trip ? " Lionel finally asked , clapping his hands together to dispel the fog , to inspire levity . <p> In the car , the little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here , thank you sir , here 's your bumbershoot . " To everything , she responded with this stuff . <p> " Is she normal " Dini asked . <p> " Of course , " said Lionel . " They all do this . " <p> " Dad called her a whippersnapper , I think , " Elaine told Dini , who was driving in order to get a feel for the big , strange family vehicle Elaine and Lionel owned . They kept lurching ; Dini kept blaming the car . <p> " Grandpa said I had a big head , " the boy put in . <p> Dini jumped at this , accelerating around a curve and sending everyone leaning left . " Here Dad goes , insulting the next generation . No wonder we all have inferiority complexes  --  he bagged on us constantly . " <p> Elaine was tired of defending her parents ; in her opinion they all had superiority complexes , anyway . She had nothing to say ; neither did her husband , who was thinking about surgery on his testicles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do have a big head . And I should know , since I gave birth to you . " <p> Dini groaned at the thought of giving birth . <p> " This whole pregnancy thing sucks , " she said . <p> " They hate it when you say ' suck , ' " Elaine told her . " Watch Mom 's face next time . She kind of cringes . " <p> " You think I do n't know that " Dini asked . " You think I do n't know every little thing that pisses them off ? " <p> " I 'm carsick , " the boy said after a while . <p> " Close your eyes . " <p> " Open the window . " <p> " Give him water . " <p> " Bumbershoot , bumbershoot , " said the girl . " Toochi , toochi , I have a tail . " <p> " Jonathan would think our trip was funny , " Dini told them . " Irony , irony , irony . " Outside , Ralph Lauren 's ranch went by ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway , surprisingly short . " Jonathan calls him the wee haberdasher , " Dini said . " He 's got a ranch the size of Idaho and he jogs on the highway . What a dope . " <p> " Haberdasher , " said the girl . " Haberdasher . " <p> " What 's irony " the boy asked . <p> " For the clothes , " said the girl . " With a board and the iron . " She slid her pudgy palm along the front of her car seat to illustrate . " I want Jonathan , " she said sadly . " Where is Jonathan ? " <p> " Mama and Daddy are going to the doctor , " Elaine told her children at the hospital parking lot . " You guys get to see Seven Dwarfs with Aunt Dini " <p> " Seven Dwarfs , Seven Dwarfs " shouted the girl . " You hear that , Sammy Seven Dwarfs . " <p> " I do n't want to go with Dini , " he boy said in a voice Elaine recognized as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He needed his parents ' attention ; something was going on and he knew it and he wanted someone to say so . <p> " You can wait in the waiting room , " Elaine said . " But it 's deadly dull , and little Beanhead here will be a pest . She 'll eat cigarette butts and bother people . " <p> Lionel , slow to recognize Elaine 's strategy , pleaded , " Just go with Dini , Sam . Do what we ask , please . " Lionel had been an only child . He had no idea how a real family worked . <p> " I do n't want to , " Sam declared . <p> " So he stays here , " Elaine said , opening her car door and hopping out . <p> Her nausea stirred up again like a flashback , like nostalgia . " Just do n't complain later when you missed the movie and the Skittles and the popcorn and the Coke . Then it 'll be too late . " She wished her sister would step in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funness , but Dini clearly felt her feelings had been hurt and was sulking . <p> " I 'll go , " Sam finally said , twisting his face from his mother 's kiss . <p> Dini drove off with them , squealing around the corner Elaine watched the backs of her children 's heads disappear . She said , " She 's not taking them to see dwarfs ; she 's taking them to something rated R. " Anger swelled in her like a balloon . <p> " She would n't do that , " Lionel said . <p> " Of course she would . " But Elaine laughed ; there was satisfaction in knowing something so surely . <p> " Later , alligator , " Lionel told her at admissions , pinching her soft bottom . She did n't want to be touched , right now , especially on the bottom . " Do n't be scared , " he added . <p> " Yeah yeah yeah , " she said . <p> " Nobody who performs vasectomies should be named Dr. Dick , " Lionel said on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always tells the same joke : at your cervix . " <p> " You 're sitting in the wah-wah seat , " said the boy to his sister . <p> " Am not " <p> " The wah-wah seat . " <p> It was a customary car argument . <p> Though he claimed not to be tired , Lionel fell asleep first on the trip back , his hands cupped chastely on his lap , protecting the remainder of his tender bunch of genitalia . Then the girl closed her eyes , and then Elaine dropped off , drugged , dreaming of R-rated chase scenes and her brother 's dead friends . Having foreseen general sleepiness , Elaine had arranged Sam in the front seat beside Dini , to keep her company . But even reliable , vigilant Sam could not resist shutting his eyes , and soon lay his sweaty head on Dini 's shoulder so that steering was difficult . <p> While Elaine 's little brood slept , Dini drove eighty miles an hour atop the dangerous cliffs . <p> At the dark summer house , she braked before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the door and windows made , the porch slats like a broad , wicked smile in the cold street light . Bats flew crazily , as if someone were throwing them around . Her Bill seemed to have gone out , not bothering to leave on a lamp for their homecoming . <p> In that second Dini let herself feel utterly sorry for herself , let self-pity collapse around her like a smelly tent . Her life was n't going to be anything like her parents ' ; it was n't even going to be like her sisters ' It was going to be a lot harder . She allowed a tear or two to leak down her face ; she prodded her own belly until her baby woke up and rolled over . Then she recovered and turned off the engine , opening her door to fill the car with bright light and a harassing metronomic beeping . <p> " Home , " she told her passengers . <p> On the answering machine were messages from Mary and their mother : everyone had arrived safely from their day on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip , " Sister Mary 's cheery voice admitted , " but we made it , of course . " <p> " Hah , " Elaine scoffed , " they think they had a trip , " trudging toward the bathroom with a hand on her abdomen , a damp pad between her legs " Who 's going to carry in the kids ? " she demanded of her pale husband and her irritable sister . <p> " I feel like a goat kicked me in the gonads , " Lionel said . " How about you ? " <p> " Ditto , " said Elaine . " That hungover hell , that postpartum wooze . " <p> " Pre-partum , here , " said Dini . <p> " We 're hopeless , " Lionel declared . <p> " Yes , but who 's the most hopeless ? " Dini asked , squatting over a footstool , her skirt blooming around her like a flower " Just leave them there , " she said , about the children . <p> " No , " Elaine told her peevishly , already planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk . " No , I 'm not going to just leave them there . " Dini had a lot to learn about parenthood , she thought ; Elaine sort of envied her her innocence while also being exasperated by it . <p> " Snapper snapper , get me out of here , you beanhead , " said the three-year-old in her sleep . She clung to Elaine 's knees until Elaine lifted her , feeling a rush of warmth between her legs as she did so . But she knew carrying her daughter would n't hurt her . Her baby needed to be held , and she felt nothing but good , warm with sleep , affectionate , easy . She was , after all , Elaine 's last baby . In front of her , Lionel faltered as he lifted Sam . <p> " Did you see Dwarfs ? " he asked the boy . <p> " I told you , I already saw Dwarfs . " Sam dropped his head on his father 's shoulder . <p> Before they went inside , Lionel asked Elaine if he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you do if you found him ? " <p> He shrugged . <p> " Then I see no point in looking . " <p> Later , the three grownups turned on lights and made toddies , dealt out cards , and tuned in a distant gospel radio station . " Brothers and sisters , " a woman sang , " welcome me in . " <p> " She 's a big fatso , " Dini guessed . " A big , black fatty . " She and Elaine cracked sunflower seeds and made a soggy husk pile between them the way they always did , as if that might help them feel normal . From where the children slept , on the couch and the easy chair , came heavy , faithful breathing . <p> Still , the house seemed empty without the others , as if a wind had blown through , stealing all familiar smells . The place lacked people  --  ones who had just been there that morning , and ones who had been there many years past ; those who might be there in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
