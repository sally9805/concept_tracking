<p> The zipper breaks on your new jacket . A rude waiter botches a dinner order . That reserved hotel room with a view looks out on a paved paradise instead of a tropical one . <p> Shoddy products , poor service and broken deals haunt most consumers . Up to half the buying public has some type of gripe each year , and between 15 percent and 25 percent of all purchases generally involve a problem . <p> Yet on average only 40 percent of those aggrieved bother to complain . <p> " People say , ' Oh , it 's not that bad ... It could be worse ... I 'm sure she had an unhappy childhood ... Nobody will listen anyway , " ' said Peter Glen , author of " It 's Not My Department ! How to Get the Service You Want , Exactly the Way You Want It . " <p> But more and more savvy consumers are discovering the squeaky wheel does get oiled . In fact , many companies welcome constructive feedback as a way of gathering free marketing data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing the right way to complain helps both parties . <p> Angela Gott , of San Rafael , Calif. , is n't afraid to air her grievances , especially while traveling . She recently received two free nights at a Sheraton hotel after informing corporate headquarters about poor service in a $ 90-a-night room at a New Jersey hotel . <p> " The bedspreads were off the beds . There was garbage in the ashtrays . The room had a smoky smell , " she said , recalling how local employees did little to make her stay more comfortable . <p> Deborah Stefanini , of Plainville , Conn. , received $ 225 in coupons from Avis car rental after complaining about a Cadillac booked for a North Carolina trip last year . She said the car was dirty and had defective windshield wipers that were discovered during a rainstorm . <p> Both women successfully resolved their problems because they had legitimate complaints , knew beforehand how they wanted them handled ( in both cases a refund was desired ) , knew who to complain to , and how to politely yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary records to back any claims . <p> Will they again patronize these companies ? You bet . <p> " It makes me a more loyal customer , " Stefanini said . <p> Acknowledging complaints is an opportunity for a company to win consumer loyalty by showing it cares , said Janelle Barlow , co-author of " A Complaint Is a Gift - Using Customer Feedback as a Strategic Tool . " <p> She suggests both parties view a complaint as a natural extension of the purchase process . <p> " If customers get good service ( when they complain ) , they will come back , " Barlow said . " They 'll go out of their way to go longer distances . They will be willing to pay higher prices and say good things . If they do n't , they will walk away ... and they will tell all their friends . " <p> Jana Janus , of San Anselmo , Calif. , is still seething about a bad experience at a neighborhood photo-developing store . She was expecting a glossy finish on five rolls of film taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead . <p> " They kept insisting I should accept them and I kept saying that it was n't what I wanted , " Janus recalled . " Finally , he ( the salesman ) grabbed the pictures and said he would do it all over again , but it would take longer than the normal 24 hours . He was nasty . <p> " To add insult to injury , he told me he threw out the old photos . He alienated me ... and my friends . " <p> Janus , however , has nothing but praise for her local grocer , who without prompting insisted she take home two pieces of carrot cake after she matter-of-factly mentioned they had been paid for but left out of a previous order . <p> Not surprisingly , the more people pay for a product or service , the better the chances they will pursue complaints . Consumers will also stand their ground based on levels of expectation - " You know you wo n't get much service in a Costco , but if you go into a Nordstrom 's your expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparing the warehouse-style store with the upscale clothing chain . <p> The complaint rate is especially high when problems arise in big-ticket items like automobiles , appliances and repairs to them . <p> Sixty-six percent of those with appliance-repair problems will voice a complaint , according to figures cited by the Consumer Federation of America . Between 57 percent and 65 percent with problems involving car sales and repairs , TV purchases and mail order also complain , the Washington-based group said . <p> The average satisfaction rate for those complaining : around 60 percent . <p> Many companies strive to maintain customer loyalty because it 's cheaper to retain customers than to acquire new ones . <p> Joseph O'Leary , partner in charge of customer satisfaction practice for Arthur Anderson &; Co. in Chicago , does such cost analyses for corporate clients . <p> He notes , for example , that it costs an average cellular phone company between $ 200 and $ 300 to acquire a new customer , including expenses for advertising , direct marketing and new equipment . But keeping that customer requires only a tenth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies do n't try to get long-term customers , they 'll end up playing the game of customer churning , where they 're constantly going out trying to acquire new customers , " O'Leary said . <p> It costs little for that wireless company to provide periodic freebies when trouble-shooting for valued customers , he noted . <p> The cost is also negligible for a hotel to upgrade the room of a disgruntled guest , especially when the better room would have remained vacant anyway , and for businesses to hand out coupons or free samples . <p> " A lot of the products that you use and love have 800 numbers on the side of their boxes and packages . Call those numbers and give feedback , " advised Eric W. Gershman , author of " 400 Steals Beyond Belief . " <p> " They will reward you ... with free products or coupons . " <p> Campbell Soup Co. , of Camden , N.J. , gives out freebies ( even providing rush delivery of hard-to-find products ) and sends refunds to customers dissatisfied with particular products , said Holly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and information center , which fields 350,000 consumer calls a year . <p> " We take that whole function very seriously , " she said . <p> Masclans noted Campbell revamped the label on its vegetable soup a few weeks ago because of customer complaints . She said last year the company replaced the 20-year-old " alphabet soup " label on its vegetable soup with a new " full serving of vegetables " slogan , and that led some to believe the product had changed . Sales slipped as a result . <p> Sears , Roebuck and Co. , which has lifetime warranties on its Craftsman tool line , has a customer relations facility with 90 employees . Its goal is to answer all calls by the third ring and to resolve most problems with the customer on the line , spokeswoman Jan Drummond said . <p> Barlow said companies are gradually becoming more consumer-oriented to stay competitive , often empowering lower-level employees to handle problems once reserved for supervisors . Individuals are becoming more sophisticated shoppers , she added . <p> George Saade , who owns an electronics store in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print up business cards that rate the service of businesses he patronizes . He hands them out to restaurants , banks and stores . <p> But author Glen said most people have a long way to go in standing up for their rights . <p> " The best thing a consumer can do to creatively complain is to find a person who can make a change - an agent , an employee who can look out for you " he said .

This may be obvious - You order a dozen bagels and receive only 11 ; you want another bagel .

Ask for a supervisor or owner if the first contact is of no help . <p> 5 ) Contact the manufacturer . If the person who sold you the defective product or service wo n't help , contact the manufacturer or corporate headquarters of the service provider . Many companies employ customer representatives or provide toll-free numbers for handling consumer complaints . <p> 6 ) Seek outside help .
