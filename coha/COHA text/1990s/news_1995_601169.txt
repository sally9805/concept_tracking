<p> For age and want , save while you may ; no morning sun lasts the whole day . - Benjamin Franklin Well , for the nation 's 76 million aging baby boomers , it plainly is no longer morning . As this week 's special report in USA TODAY on retirement makes clear , millions of boomers face a leaden future in their supposedly golden years . <p> A quick trip through the retirement planning guide in today 's Money section should demonstrate to many that rather than fun in the sun in their 50s and 60s , as many retirees today enjoy , future retirees may have to work into their 70s to survive . <p> Why ? The simple answer is that not enough have followed Franklin 's admonition to save so they can afford to retire . <p> Personal saving rates in the USA are a miserable 4% , less than half the level of the 1960s and 1970s and a third of that needed to secure a decent retirement income . <p> But individuals are n't totally to blame . The nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USA 's highly mobile , job-changing workforce . <p> The pension mismatch <p> Most federal tax benefits and rules are aimed at providing safety and security  --  including taxpayer-backed insurance - for pensions with defined benefits provided by employers based on years of employment . <p> Those defined-benefit plans are most prevalent in companies with 250 or more employees . They generally require workers to stay with a company five years to earn even a minimum benefit and remain 30 years to earn full benefits . <p> That 's a pretty good deal for the 28% of workers who stay with a single employer for 20 years or more  --  as long as it 's the last 20 before retirement . <p> If it 's the first 20 years , forget it . <p> Why ? Two reasons . Wages in your first 20 years will be lower than in your last 20 . And inflation . Even at 3% , it 'll cut the value of your benefits in half . That makes the vesting you 've put so much stock in almost worthless unless you stick around . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your company has incentives to see that you do n't stick around . <p> The sheer size of the baby boom threatens to squeeze company pension plans , tempting companies to cut benefits or dispose of older workers . Tax rules set by Congress in 1987 in a quest to raise revenue amplified that problem . They doubled the cost to business of providing pensions for long-term employees in their 50s while cutting the cost of hiring workers under 40 . <p> Mostly , though , people do n't get much out of their pension plans because the nation 's pension system no longer fits the American workforce . Small companies , a growing source of employment , ca n't afford them . And people change jobs so often  --  on average 10 times  --  that they ca n't cash in fully on defined benefit plans . You can see the effect in the chart at the top of this page . <p> Women , especially , are shortchanged . Because of child rearing , they stay with employers less than five years on average , compared with nearly seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company pension provides only 20% of a worker 's wage at retirement time , not enough to maintain anyone 's standard of living . <p> What workers need are retirement plans they can rely on and carry with them from job to job  --  plans that let people benefit from their early working years . <p> Such plans do exist . They 're called defined contribution plans because employers promise only a certain level of contribution , not a certain benefit , and most often in exchange for contributions by workers . <p> The most widespread form is the popular 401(k) plan . Current tax rules allow employees to make up to a $ 9,240 tax-deductible contribution each year to such plans . Employers can make a full or partial tax-deductible match , or contribute nothing at all . In any event , the money in the account then can grow tax deferred until it is withdrawn after age 59 1/2 for retirement . And it can be rolled over into a new 401(k) or individual retirement account if an employee switches jobs . <p> Compared with defined benefit plans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers . <p> So , how come they 're available to only 37% of workers , and nearly half of those at companies with traditional pensions ? <p> Again , federal rules . <p> Congress did n't want too much of the benefit from 401(k) plans to go to highly compensated employees  --  those making more than $ 66,000 . So , they can save no more than two percentage points above what workers making less save . <p> While that may sound like simple fairness , it basically means that younger , lower-paid workers  --  because they tend not to contribute  --  can veto pension savings by older , better-paid workers . <p> Coupled with other limits on benefits for better-paid employees , the rule complicates compliance by small employers , discouraging them from offering any of their workers this retirement savings option . <p> And if those rules were n't bad enough , the Clinton administration and Congress last year made 401(k)s even less attractive by putting tighter limits on contributions . <p> The result : less saving , lower pension , more retirement insecurity . <p> What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple fact : Tens of millions of Americans are heading into their retirement years with little put aside . <p> Social Security wo n't meet their needs . The whopping size of the baby boom means those benefits likely will shrink . Traditional pensions also face cuts . <p> The quickest , easiest way to pump up retirement savings is to expand the use of 401(k)s and similar plans . <p> Rules that discourage small companies from offering them should be eased . Contribution limits should be raised . And following Franklin 's admonition , government should again encourage Americans to save , save , save . <p> Will it cost the government money ? Sure , in the short run . And other taxes may need to be raised to pay for it . <p> But the baby boom 's retirement needs are real and gigantic . And the night of their arrival is near . <p> Pension insecurity Will your pension plan really take care of you ? That depends greatly on how often you change jobs , particularly in middle age . Here 's a comparison of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same company for 40 years . The other changed jobs every 10 years . Both earned $ 15,000 at age 25 and , after raises of 5% per year , earned $ 105,600 at age 65 . <p> Age/salary <p> 25 $ 15,000 30 $ 19,000 35 $ 24,433 40 $ 31,184 45 $ 39,799 50 $ 50,795 55 $ 64,829 60 $ 82,740 65 $ 105,600 <p> Worker 1 , age/annual pension benefit 25 $ 150 30 $ 1,149 35 $ 2,688 40 $ 4,989 45 $ 8,358 50 $ 13,207 55 $ 20,097 60 $ 29,786 65 $ 43,296 <p> Worker 2 , age/annual pension benefit 25 $ 150 30 $ 1,149 35 $ 2,571 40 $ 4,198 45 $ 6,515 50 $ 9,165 55 $ 12,940 60 $ 17,256 65 $ 23,500 <p> Shift in pension plans <p> Companies increasingly are shifting from traditional pensions , or defined benefit plans , to defined contribution plans , which do n't promise set benefits .
