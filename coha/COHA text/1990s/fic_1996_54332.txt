" Sitters " marks Michael Libling 's second sale to F &SF,; but it is his first appearance in the magazine . Why are we publishing the second before the first ? Well , because we 're saving the first for our annual baseball issue in a few months . <p> For nearly twenty years , Michael has made his living by writing nonfiction , promotion , and advertising copy . His first fiction sale was to a British anthology . <p> A bout the story , he writes , " As patents , my wife and I always tended to hold our daughters ' hands a little tighter whenever we would see the posters of missing children that appear in test stops along the Interstates . And then one day , I began to wonder : with seemingly so many missing children reported , what if some of these disappearances had no earthy rationale ? " <p> Some things you need to keep to yourself . Sometimes , it is wiser just to go with the flow . It is certainly safer . <p> " Daddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head . Click , click . Click , click . " <p> The way the kid was flailing about in the water , shrieking and carrying on , our first thought was shark attack . That 's what most everybody else seemed to think , too , because anyone who had been in the water was now on shore , gaping , pointing and cataloguing revolting details to pass on to friends and relatives . <p> We stashed our tuna sandwiches and cranberry sodas back in the cooler , dipped celery sticks into the cheese dip to tide us over , and trotted up to join the crowd to watch the girl get eaten by the shark . <p> Usually , I would wonder how anyone could wade , let alone swim , in these frigid Maine waters , but this day the waves wrapped themselves easily round my ankles and withered warmly between my toes . Perhaps something had pushed the Gulf Stream waters off course . There were no reports of approaching hurricanes ; then again , you never know . <p> " Her name is Annie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We were playing Frisbee together . " Kath and I held our daughter 's hands a little tighter . <p> A woman , panicking as only a mother might , splashed into the surf , heels kicking , arms stroking the air , reaching for a dive that was taking too long to come . A lifeguard caught her chest-high loverly eager , I thought ) , and his partner helped drag the woman back to safety . Her screeching alternated with her daughter 's , filling any stray patches of silence the ocean failed to claim . The combination reminded me of gulls wrestling over fries and battered shrimp tails at the canteen trash can . It was then I realized there were no gulls about , save for a trio hovering quietly in an almost wait-and-see mode at the far end of the beach where the new cottages begin , right above Paul Blankenship 's , as a matter of fact . <p> " I think if it were a shark , she would 've been gone by now , " said the lifeguard with the better tan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see any dorsal fin or blood in the water neither . " <p> " I say we go then , " said the first . <p> " Yup , " said the second . <p> But they did not budge . They stood staring along with everyone else . I thought of taking action , but it did not go beyond that . <p> Then Rachel said , " Look , there 's Mommy . " And the next thing I know , my wife and the girl 's mother have grabbed a rubber dinghy and bounded into the surf . Before I could summon enough wind to call Kath back , they were off and rowing . As luck would have it , an outgoing wave shot them right to their quarry , almost knocking the poor kid over , but she managed to keep her balance as she stumbled to deeper waters , armpit-high now . <p> Kath extended her oar and the girl grabbed on . A short struggle , a couple of heaves , and they hoisted her aboard . <p> The crowd applauded . The lifeguards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed them back to shore . <p> The lifeguards tried to restrain the crowd as the two women carried the girl onto the beach . The girl and her mother wore the same rainbow-striped bathing suits . <p> " Give her air , " the tanned lifeguard shouted . " Somebody call for an ambulance . " <p> " I 'll begin the CPR , " said the other . <p> But the girl 's mother blocked their way . " Touch her , and I 'll scratch your eyes out , " she warned . <p> " Or worse , " added Kath , brandishing an oar . <p> " But we have authority here , " the lifeguards blustered with no trace of authority . <p> Kath was on her knees , smoothing the girl 's dark brown hair . Her head was propped upon Kath 's thighs , her body rigid , eyes open but frozen dead-ahead , her chin tucked into the hollow of her neck . Rachel and I sidled closer , sheepish , the way people tend to be when they have an inside connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Is she very badly bitten ? " I asked quietly . <p> Kath did not take my lead . She spoke for all to hear . " From what I can see , there are no bites . I do n't think there ever was a shark . " <p> The disappointment in the crowd was evident . Both Kath and I winced . <p> " Then what was all the commotion about ? " I asked , my voice still low . Kath shrugged . <p> The girl 's mother moved her hands to her hips . Her voice shook . " You were n't playing wolf again , were you , Annie ? You would n't put me through  --  " <p> Annie shook her head . " No , mommy , " she sobbed , and pointed to her stomach . <p> " What is it , honey ? " <p> " It 's still there , " she cried , the tears intensifying . <p> The woman knelt beside her daughter , apprehension rising as she peeked under the swimsuit . The crowd stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covering her mouth . " Annie ! Poor Annie . " <p> " What is it ? " Kath gulped , leaning lower for a better view . <p> " What is it ? " I echoed , not certain I really wanted to know . <p> The woman slipped the straps of the swimsuit from her daughter 's shoulders and gingerly peeled the top down to the girl 's waist . <p> I turned my head to the side , watching with one eye . I advised Rachel to do the same , but she ignored me , as bold as her mother . <p> Like most , I was expecting a bloody cavity of shredded flesh , but instead , there on the girl 's belly , shimmering innocent and silver in the noonday sunshine , mouth resting contentedly in her navel , lay a fish . No more than seven or eight inches in length , it seemed barely alive , gills pulsating ever so slowly . <p> As the realization spread , people began to giggle . Some returned to the water , others to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bloody fish , " groaned one of the lifeguards . " How the heck did it get under there ? Never seen anything like that . " <p> " Could be a baby shark , could n't it ? " <p> " I think it 's a herring , " a local suggested . The fishing lures in his hat enhanced his credibility . <p> An elderly lady , beer can trembling in left hand , tried to make Annie feel better : " What a pretty girl you are . And a very good fisherman , too . Have your mother fry that up with a little milk and flour , some butter and lemon juice . " <p> " Did n't know these waters had herrings , " said a woman with sunglasses on her head . <p> " I like herring , especially the tidbits in wine sauce with onions , " said somebody else . <p> But the girl 's mother was neither swayed nor impressed . " I do n't care what it is , " she declared , and swatted the fish with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dropped to the sand at my feet . <p> I jumped back . " Jesus ! " I said , brushing imaginary scales from my leg . <p> " Hi , Annie . " Rachel curled her fingers into a tiny wave . " Want the rest of my celery stick ? It 's got cheese dip on it . " <p> No one bothered to examine the herring . Except for a hungry gull that glided in from nowhere . <p> " There 's a click m my head , Daddy , " Rachel reported at bedtime . <p> " Again ? " <p> " Uh-huh . But more like a clock this time . Tick , tock , tick , tock . " <p> " Well , Mommy brought you to the doctor and he said it was nothing . Sometimes things like this happen when we get excited . And this has been an exciting day for you  --  for all of us . " <p> " Especially Annie . " Rachel nodded . <p> I tucked her in , and met Kath on the porch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . <p> I smiled . " Make it a double . " <p> * * * <p> When we first started coming to Goose Breakers  --  six years before , just after Rachel was born  --  the closest gym was way up in Portland , so I got into the habit of jogging to Cape Beckon and back each morning after sunrise . ( Well , to be honest , I walk more than I jog . ) Although a gym finally opened in Cheterbunk , summer before last , I felt the fee for tourists was out of line and stuck with the jogging . Besides , who in their right mind would make time for stair-climbers while on vacation ? There was also the daily chat and mug of coffee with Paul Blankenship to consider . <p> Paul was an orthodontist from Buffalo who wrote novels on the side . He had published four , and had given me copies of the last three . Occasionally , he promised to dig out his first for me , but never did , and I made a point of not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slogging through the early chapters , resorted to skimming and scanning . <p> An alcoholic stockbroker , obsessed with a schizophrenic tollbooth attendant and former nun , discovers he is the bastard great-grandson of post-impressionist painter Paul Gaugin and his life is forever altered . <p> A Mohawk discus thrower and Olympic hopeful , the one-time foster child of a renegade Amish family , becomes infatuated with a Romanian diving coach who , on page 92 of the 564 page opus , learns she has multiple sclerosis  --  a crisis which leads to their shared quest to climb Mexico 's Popocatepetl and discover the mystic truths that dwell therein . <p> A Buffalo hematologist abandons his career and family to paint urchins in the streets of Cuzco , Peru , eventually losing his way and his sanity in the alleys of Machu Picchu . <p> I supposed he was a good writer ; the paperbacks were oversized and overpriced , and looked nothing like a Clancy or a Grisham . Of course , I never told him that his style was beyond me and that Clancy and Grisham were , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people who do not smile and I write books that people do not buy , " he once told me . <p> " They 're wonderful stories , " I lied . <p> " But if the artist is unappreciated , is that his failure or his audience 's ? " <p> I tended to shrug a lot around Paul . <p> On the other hand , I enjoyed his company and conversation . I often told him he should be narrating documentaries . I also know he looked forward to my two-week stay that usually landed in the middle of his six , especially since his wife and daughters had thrown him out . Last vacation , he had brought along their grounds , a pretty young dental assistant with long black hair and lips in a permanent pucker , but she had since left him , too . It was just as well , she was quite a distraction . As Kath had said , " Laurel does n't wear clothes , she wears invitations . " <p> Every morning as long as it was n't raining I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wave as I trotted by . It was his cue to put on the coffee . By the time I returned , a hot mug would be waiting for me on the patio , usually with a couple of muffins , if he remembered to pick any up . ( When his wife was still with him , they would be homemade . Big dry , unswallowable , brown things that somehow came to life with coffee . ) We 'd chat till about eight-fifteen , he 'd give me a cinnamon candy stick for Rachel , and then I 'd head back to the cottage to start breakfast for her and Kath . It was a comforting routine . As I was soon to be reminded , however , routines are easily demolished . <p> It was the day after the fish-in-Annie's-swimsuit incident . As I rounded Ripple Rock near the pier at Cape Beckon , slowing from sluggish jog to listless walk , a dark streak of something shot across the path in front of me ; a shadow cut loose from an unseen entity . I broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driftwood , and fell to one knee . Whatever it was landed several feet to my left . I caught my breath , picked myself up , sighed , and hesitantly limped over for a closer look . <p> Talk about coincidences . It was my second suicidal herring in two days . I 'd heard of whales pulling stunts like this , but never fish . I glanced cautiously out to sea , just to make sure no whale was following . I made a mental note to call the Coast Guard . This was something a marine biologist might want to investigate . The thought made perfect sense . Then . <p> It flopped about in the sand , sucking air through desperate gills . I considered saving its life , tossing it back to the sea , but could not bring myself to touch it . For all I knew , this suicide thing could be contagious , and I might end up throwing myself into the sea , or into traffic , or something . So I left the herring to gasp and bake in the dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul 's , but my coffee was waiting for me as usual on the arm of the old wooden garden chair . The chairs and patio table were all that remained from the shack that had previously stood on the site . Everything else about the place was new , in a rustic , countryish sort of way . <p> " I 'm here , " I shouted up the knoll toward the screen door , assuming Paul was fetching the muffins . The coffee was still hot . <p> On the arm of the chair , Paul 's seat , a fat paperback lay open . It was Gravity 's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon . I thumbed through it for a bit , lost Paul 's place , and hurriedly set it back on the arm , hoping he would n't notice until after I was gone . Clearly , another book I would never get into . <p> This was n't like Paul . He had kept me waiting only once before , the morning alter he 'd downed a bucket of bad clams at Mary Salt 's Lobster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheterbunk to get him some Fowler 's Strawberry Extract , but they were out of stock , so I brought him a cardboard bucket of white rice from the Great Wall Care . " You okay in there ? " I called . <p> The reply was a sickening scream that pierced the base of my spine and drop-kicked my stomach into my mouth . The mug shattered on the patio as I leaped from the chair . I whirled about to face the house , my heart pounding , my throat dry . Something was moving on the ground behind the shrubs at the top of the knoll . I took two steps back . " Paul ? " I said hopefully . " Is that you ? " <p> The patio lies roughly a hundred feet from the ocean at the base of the knoll behind Paul 's house . ( The knoll is a bulldozed bastardization of the dunes Goose Breakers is famous for . It runs the entire length of the new development . ) From the back door of the house , pastel paving stones lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lead down to the patio . At the top edge of the slope , on either side of the steps , a short , bushy hedge runs the width of the house , turning at the perimeter of the property line and running up toward the road . <p> The scream came again and I started to calm . It was a seagull , scavenging busily behind the shrubs . I smiled foolishly , embarrassed that Paul might have seen my less than rational behavior . What was keeping him , anyway ? <p> " Looks like I spilled my coffee , " I said . " Better wear your sandals out here , Paul , I broke the mug . " Where was he ? <p> I started up the steps . The seagull ignored me as I paused at the top , but I could not ignore it . I began to gag . The gull was pecking at a dark ball of mucous , fieshy sinews dangling , the blood of whatever it was still wet . Then I noticed the screen of the door had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his back on the kitchen floor . <p> Bile rose quickly , and I vomited on the Welcome Neighbor doormat beneath Paul 's heels . Now , I knew what the gull had been eating . Paul 's eyes had been plucked crudely from their sockets . His face was a mass of blood and black and blue . Broken teeth defiled his lips and chin . His nose was crushed flat and featureless . Suddenly , what I assumed to be the smell of death overwhelmed me . I staggered back toward the door , tripping through the open portal and onto my behind . It was from here I saw the fish . <p> It lay several feet beyond Paul 's head , in the short hallway that connects the kitchen to the sitting room . And it sure as hell was n't any damned herring . This was a big fish . Real big . <p> " I 'd say we have ourselves a killer halibut , here , " chuckled the investigating officer . <p> " Could only happen to a tourist , " his sidekick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upchucks every once in awhile . Unfortunately , this time , your buddy was the upchuckee . " <p> It was a freak accident . That 's all there was to it . Case closed . <p> I provided details on Paul 's next of kin , but I thought it best to call Abby , his ex , on my own . <p> She hardly said a word until I 'd finished . <p> " From the looks of it , Abby , he went quickly . " <p> " A fish ? You 're telling me a fish ? " <p> " I 'm afraid so , " I said . " A real flukey kind of thing . " <p> " Scales of justice , no doubt , " she said , with no trace of irony . <p> " We leave tomorrow , " I told Kath . A week remained on the rental , but she did not protest . We were both shaken by Paul 's death . <p> Around midnight , Rachel awoke from a bad dream . She called , " Mommy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she looked right through me to Kath . " You 're not my mommy , " she said . <p> " Of course , I am , honey . It 's me , Mommy . " <p> " No , " she insisted . " No , you 're not . " <p> At best , we slept uneasily , till a bullying wind and an intimidating thunder kept us up for good . <p> It was a bit past five when the rain began its assault , blasting in torrents down the sides of the house , obliterating the sunrise . The thunder had escalated to bombing raid as Kath ran to Rachel and I rushed from room to room closing windows . It did n't do much good . The wind drove water through the cracks of the frames , soaking the walls and floors as thoroughly as if I had not shut the windows at all . The view from every side was a watery blur , as if the house had been dropped behind a waterfall . The thought of a tidal wave surfaced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the rooms , fearing the panes would crash in on me . <p> Whoosh . Whoosh . Whoosh . Whoosh . <p> Finally , I got back up to Kath . She sat on the edge of Rachel 's bed , our daughter in her arms . The ceiling was leaking in several places , somehow missing the bed . " We 'd better get downstairs , " I said , breath short , words clipped . " I do n't know what 's going on out there , but it 's not good . " And , as if to confirm my words , the wind roared hungrily overhead , snapped its jaws down on the roof , and , with a violent cracking , wrenched the covering away . Then it came looking for us  --  shingles and nails flying . And fish . All kinds of fish . Sloshing and flipping and splashing . I tossed Rachel over my shoulder , Kath grabbed the door , and we dashed into the hall and down the stairs . In soggy pursuit , a river sluiced behind us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The door frames , " Kath pointed . " It 's safest under the door frames . " I 'd thought that advice applied only to earthquakes , but I was n't going to argue . <p> We squatted in the archway between the kitchen and dining room , and passed the time counting fish plunge down the staircase . They 'd flop about for a spell , glance off furniture and walls , attempt to find deeper waters , and then just lie there . For Rachel 's sake , the ever-resourceful Kath turned it into a game . " And that 's a flounder . An ocean perch . Another flounder . A sea herring . Pollack , I think . . . . " <p> And that is where we stayed , until t he winds relaxed , and the thunder and rain played out , and the water ceased to flow down our stairs . Our count , by the way , had reached forty-four , with flounder slightly ahead of herring in number . <p> Mindful that the worst might yet be on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed for daylight  --  the eye of a hurricane without the hurricane . Neighbors all along our st retch of beach were doing the same . Most in pajamas . Some in towels and underwear . The solitude surreal . The gawking natural . The humidity stifling . <p> Ours was the only house to lose a roof . As well , a support beam from the porch had been dislodged , denting the fender of our car . At this stage , all that mattered to me was that the engine revved and the wheels turned . We were getting away from Goose Breakers . Today . <p> " My god ! Will you look at that ! " a neighbor cried , and our attention skipped from house to beach . Dismay turned to awe . <p> Somehow , in the midst of the storm , someone had managed to get down to the beach . And in defiance of wind and rain and logic , this individual had carved a sand sculpture that rimmed the realm of impossibility . No sea serpent or moated castle , here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe , fifteen feet high . A magnificent creation . A fragile beauty with sad eyes and a sadder smile . Strangely familiar eyes . Strangely familiar smile . Her hair caressed her shoulders and her dress skimmed the buckles of her sandals . She stood with arms outstretched , beckoning , beseeching . <p> " I want to go to her , " said Rachel . <p> " You stay put , " I ordered , reaching for her hand , securing her by the wrist . <p> " She reminds me of the statue of Jesus that overlooks Rio , " Kath whispered . <p> " It makes no sense , " I said . " How could it have survived the storm ? " <p> " I want to go to her , " Rachel repeated . <p> " Her hair . " Kath swallowed . " I think her hair is moving . " <p> " It 's the wind , " I said . " The wind is picking up again . " <p> " No , " Kath corrected . " It 's more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman disintegrated before us , the grains of her being drawn outward to the sea , I was almost sure she had closed her eyes . Before us , a short dive and a half-dozen breaststrokes from the shore , three massive whirlpools churned , mutating to whirlwinds as they rose , humming kazoo-like as they climbed . Higher and higher , they spiraled , taking the sand woman with them , penetrating the muddy scud , on course for the sky itself . <p> " The middle one is so pretty , " said Rachel . The words had barely left her lips when lightning flashed within the center vortex , irradiating it from bottom to as high as we could see As one bolt of lightning waned , another flashed alive , and another , and another , maintaining the towering spectacle of electrified and brilliant blue . " So pretty , " Rachel said again . " So pretty . Like Mommy . " I 'd never heard of Nature pulling a stunt like this . It was the Fourth of July and New Year 's Eve rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends with forever . <p> The whirlwind on the left was the first to collapse , dissipating as it toppled out to sea . The one on the right followed ; collapsing parallel to shore , sending onlookers scurrying from their porches as waves rumbled up the dunes and over , perilously close to the homes . <p> The middle one continued to twirl , one spindle anchored to the ocean floor , one tethered to the sky . The faster it spun , the greater the intensity of the lightning within it . Then it , too , began to sway . <p> " It 's going to fall this way , " Kath said . " I know it 's going to fall this way . " She grabbed Rachel by the hand ; they ran onto the beach and toward the dunes that front Comber 's Inn . I had nothing to go by except Kath 's instinct , but that was good enough for me . I could not , however , bring myself to leave the car behind . Where the hell were my keys ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachel had run , but was blinded by the blue . . . engulfed by the blue . . . terrified by the blue . . . deafened by the blue . Sand swept into my eyes and coated my face . I could feel the pressure rising in my ears and I feared the roof of my head was about to blow off . I dropped to my knees and the blue grabbed me by the neck and smashed me face-first into the driveway . It relented momentarily , and I scrambled under the car as the vortex struck . <p> The house imploded , then exploded , in a watery conflagration . <p> The backwash spit me out from under the car and dragged me onto the beach . My knees were bloody . My arms were scraped . My face was cut . And fish were fighting for their lives all around me . So this was the smell of death I had experienced at Paul 's house . So death smelled like fish . <p> Our cottage was driftwood . I thanked God it was a rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My wallet was gone , but a neighbor found Kath 's money pouch at the side of her house sitting atop an abandoned lobster trap . <p> This was not my idea of a fun vacation . <p> I had anticipated that I might need to break a window , but it turned out to be easier than that . Although the back door to Paul 's cottage had been boarded up , the nails did not extend into the jamb . It opened without resistance . <p> I sidestepped the bloodstains on the floor and snatched Paul 's car keys from the Bertrand Russell cookie jar in the kitchen . I telephoned Abby to explain , but only her answering machine was home . I told it I 'd get the car back as soon as possible . <p> I deposited our house keys with the rental agent . <p> " I 'll speak to the owners about getting you a refund for your final week , " she said . <p> " I do n't care about a refund . But I 'll let you know if my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I hope you have a good policy . It was , you know , an act of God . " <p> " An act of God ? Yah , " I said , " I suppose that 's what you 'd call it . " <p> We managed to avoid the stringer for the Portland paper , and were on the road and headed home before noon . The Audi drove like a dream , but I wisely kept the thought to myself . Why spoil a good thing ? <p> We caught our collective breath over a late lunch at the Pizza Hut in Concord . <p> As we left the parking lot , I thought I saw flames rising from the restaurant 's roof . I readjusted the rear-view mirror and they vanished from sight . <p> We were no more than ten minutes back on the road when Rachel unbuckled her belt and dove for the steering wheel , the heel of her hand hammering the horn . I swerved into the oncoming lane , but , luckily , traffic was almost non-existent . The tires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , rapping the rear fender off a Fresh Fruit Ahead sign . <p> " What in the hell  --  ? My God , Rachel ! " My hands were stuck to the wheel . " What made you do that ? Are you trying to kill us ? " <p> " It 's the alarm , " she said . <p> " The what ? " <p> " The alarm . " <p> " You ca n't do that , honey , when Daddy 's driving . We could be very badly hurt . " <p> " No . " She shook her head . " We wo n't be . " Then she began to cry . " There 's a whistle in my head . A whistle in my head . A whistle in my head . " <p> Kath moved to the back seat to sit with her . <p> " I think we better get a second opinion on what 's going on inside her , Kath . This is really starting to worry me . " <p> " I 'll make the appointment first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachel as the seat belt would allow . <p> Bill &; Wanda 's , the track stop at the Hickam exit , is where it finally came together , or fell apart , depending on your point of view . Stopping here was one of our traditions  --  breakfast on the way to Maine , supper on the return . It was less than ninety minutes from home . <p> We had missed the dinner rush , so the restaurant was fairly quiet . Two truckers chatted at the counter , polishing off key lime pie and downing bottomless cups of coffee . A couple with a teenage boy argued over menu choices . Two heavy-set older ladies , with yellow hair in ringlets and faces buried in orange pancake , munched on chicken fingers and sipped Bud Lites through straws . <p> We sat in a booth a couple of rows over from the window . I would have preferred to sit at the window , but the sun was too bright and the dead flies on the sill dulled appetites . I wanted to keep an eye on Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fender , claiming it was there when I picked it up , but anything else might not be so easy . <p> The waitress took our order  --  grilled cheese for Rachel , taco salads and Buffalo wings for Kath and me  --  and we settled back to wait . <p> Rachel played with the jukebox buttons and flipped the selection cards , not asking but obvious as to what she wanted . I dug three quarters out of my pocket  --  5 plays for 75 cents , and handed them over . She took them eagerly , punching in numbers at random . A-6 . B-3 . C-2 . A-4 . E-9 . <p> " There 's singing in my head , " Rachel smiled , before a single note came through the speaker . <p> Kath and I smiled thinly at each other . <p> Patti Page came up first . She was dancing with her darling to the Tennessee Waltz when a freezer truck barreled into the parking lot , took out a row of gas pumps , bounded airborne off the rear of a flatbed and landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There was no explosion . Just thick black smoke , rising over the scene . A small gusher danced where the gas pumps had been . <p> I looked at Kath , she looked at me and , together , we shut our eyes and bit our lower lips . What next ? What next ? <p> A kid in greasy overalls burst into the restaurant . " Everybody out of here . Ken says it 's gon na blow . Get down to the gully out back . Hurry . " <p> I did n't know who Ken was . I still do n't . But I sensed he knew what he was talking about . <p> " This way , " our waitress announced , flagging everyone toward the kitchen . " It 's faster . " <p> The yellow-haired ladies were the first to go , their chicken fingers and beers in hand . We moved to follow , but Rachel would not budge . <p> The lights flickered , then died . The buzz of a generator kicked in and emergency lights flashed on , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sunset turned to gray , the murkiness flooding through the windows . <p> " This is no time to play games , " I said . <p> Rachel huddled in the comer of the booth . " I 'm listening to the singing " she said . <p> " There is no singing , Rachel . The power is off . Come , " I ordered . <p> She slid onto the floor and under the booth . <p> " I 'm warning you , Rachel . Either you come out right now or  --  " <p> Kath shot me a glance , and I backed off . Kath knelt beside the table . " The man said we have to get out of the restaurant right away , Rachel . It 's very dangerous to stay in here . Please come out from under there . " <p> " No , " she said . " I 'm listening to the singing . " <p> " Cripes ! " I slammed the table and dropped to one knee beside Kath . " Enough is enough . You get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give you a spanking you 'll never forget . " I had never laid a hand on her , I was n't even sure if she knew what a spanking was . <p> Rachel shook her head , defiant . She skittered under the adjacent booth and out the other side . She stood , and then we saw that someone was standing beside her . <p> " Catch her , " I shouted . " Please ! " Two hands reached down and Rachel was lifted above our sightline . <p> As we rose , a blue glow filled the restaurant , sublimating the gray . I figured the generator had started up again . <p> " Thank you , " Kath began to say , but the words froze in her throat . She grabbed my arm . My legs began to tremble ; I gripped a table for support . My heart raced toward cardiac arrest . <p> It was the woman from the beach . The woman of sand . Except , this time , she was real , her proportions human and her fragility unearthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces cheek to cheek . More than anything , it was the resemblance between the two that stunned us , that told us all we dared imagine . <p> " Simply look the other way , " she said . " When you turn around , we will be gone . That is the way it always happens . It is the best way , " she said , her voice as serene as her manner . <p> Kath held her ground . " There is no way I am going to look the other way . If you do n't put her down and let her go , I 'm screaming for help . " <p> " I am sorry , " she said . " But as a sitter , you should never become too attached to the children you care for . " <p> Kath attempted to step forward , but could not advance . " I am not a sitter . I am her mother . " <p> " No , " she said , her words hewed in stone , the edges sharp . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Yes . But it was my egg and my seed , " the woman said . <p> " She 's mine , " Kath cried . <p> " No . You were only caring for her until she was of age to join me . The people of your world serve us well in this regard . You are among the finest sitters in the galaxy . But the time has come  --  as the alarms have clearly indicated  --  and she belongs with her own . She is fit to travel . " <p> " Alarms ? " I asked , my voice cracking . <p> " The storm , the truck crash , the sea creature that killed your friend , among other things , " she explained , her regret sincere . " I am particularly sorry about your friend , but we have no control . It comes from within the child . Once the alarm begins to function , it continues until the reunion . It is the only effective method we have to find and reclaim our children . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more than that . You had your years with her . Remember them . Think fondly of them . Now it is my turn to enjoy her . Now look the other way , " she said again . " When you turn around , we will begone . That is the way it always happens . It is the best way , believe me . " <p> " Please , Rachel , come to Mommy , " Kath pleaded , her tears flowing , me blubbering helplessly beside her . <p> " I am with Mommy , " Rachel answered . <p> The blue retreated from the room , withdrawing from the ceiling , walls and floor , shrinking aura-like to envelop only Rachel and the woman . Kath reached out . Rachel 's fingers curled into a tiny wave . <p> All that remained was the emptiness . <p> When they questioned us , we told them everything we knew . " A lady in blue stole our daughter . " <p> Funny how incidents that once seemed insignificant take on a whole new meaning . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Blue Fairy came on screen . " Mommy ! Mommy ! " For a long while after that , I teased Kath , calling her the Blue Fairy . <p> Kath and I hung together for a year or so , but it came to pass that we could no longer face the day or each other . <p> Sometimes , I see Rachel 's picture on the posters of missing children . Recently , computers updated her photo to show how she might appear today . Seems she 's looking more and more like her mother . <p> I guess Paul got to me more than I realized . I 've taken to writing stories now . Like this one . And that 's pretty much what everybody thinks they are . Stories . <p> It is certainly safer this way . <p> <p> By Michael Libling <p>
