<p> EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J.  --  Escorted by two 250-pound wrestlers with shaved heads , painted faces and multiple body rings , the Great White Hope of the GOP Eastern Establishment walked through the stomping , howling mob on the arena floor . <p> The Honorable Christine Todd Whitman , governor of New Jersey , was at the World Wrestling Federation SummerSlam to receive a " tax-cutting championship belt . " <p> The 50-year-old governor , who wore slacks , a dark golf shirt and a gold necklace , thrust the 10-pound belt over her head like Hulk Hogan . <p> " Anyone who wants to take this belt from me 's gon na have to fight ! " she yelled . Lowering her voice and growling her R 's like a ring announcer , she cried into the mike , " We 're READY TO RUMBLE here in New Jersey ! " <p> Which is sort of her problem . <p> In her first term Whitman has cut state income taxes by 30% , presided over a record drop in crime and helped elect Republicans around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notoriously grouchy voters are READY TO RUMBLE . They have a few words for Whitman as she seeks a second term , and they 're not " thank you . " <p> They 're " property taxes . " And " auto insurance . " <p> New Jersey 's average yearly auto premium , more than $ 1,000 , is the nation 's highest , and many voters blame Whitman for failing to realize her 1993 campaign promise to cut premiums 25% . Local property taxes have risen , and many blame Whitman for that , too . People complained that her state tax cuts forced a drop in aid to municipalities and that , in turn , sent local taxes higher . <p> So now Whitman finds herself targeted by the same talk show boo-birds and grass-roots agitators who helped her drive Jim Florio from office after he raised income taxes . <p> These pocketbook issues have resurrected a charge Whitman thought she laid to rest four years ago : that a patrician like her ca n't appreciate the problems of Joe from Bayonne . <p> Jeff Deminski is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance revolt , just as his predecessor at the statewide station helped spark the rebellion against Florio 's taxes . " She does n't stand up to the big business interests because of her walk of life , " he says . " Some of our callers say she 's like Marie Antoinette : ' Let ' em eat cake . ' . . . People feel $ 1,000 does n't mean to her what it does to me . " <p> Her Democratic opponent , state Sen. James McGreevey , plays the class card . " This state needs a governor who understands what it means to pay an electric bill , " he told AFL-CIO delegates . He reminded them that his immigrant grandfather worked in the Bayonne shipyard . <p> Whitman 's Princeton-educated grandfather was a construction tycoon who helped create Rockefeller Center , and she grew up on a 230-acre estate in northwest New Jersey 's horse country . Last year she and her husband made $ 525,000 . <p> She has taken the risk of repeatedly campaigning on the economic issues that polls say are her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three straight days . <p> When asked about the class thing , Whitman seems frustrated . " I 'm a wife and a mother , " she says . " I drove the car pool . We had the playgroups at our house . . . . We have two young drivers in our family , so we know about insurance rates . " <p> She even knows about pro wrestling , and appearances at the likes of SummerSlam convey a message : Christie from Far Hills understands Joe from Bayonne . <p> A year ago Whitman was basking in her role as tax-cut champion . GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole promised " to do for America what Christie Whitman has done for New Jersey . " <p> An abortion-rights supporter and a proponent of affirmative action , Whitman was a candidate suburban women voters could love and GOP conservatives could live with . Newt Gingrich even joined those promoting her as a vice presidential prospect . But some conservatives are having second thoughts . <p> " Whitman is in the doldrums , " the movement 's mouthpiece , the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing of the GOP , she increasingly speaks for its liberal fringe . " <p> The magazine said her veto of a bill banning a late-term abortion procedure , the so-called " partial-birth " abortion , " knocks her out of the running as a national candidate . " Her use of a complicated pension bond issue , rather than spending cuts , to balance her budget was said to " give tax cuts a bad name . " <p> Here , too , there 's an element of class resentment . Whitman personifies the moderate Republicanism once championed by Eastern establishment figures ( and Whitman heroes ) such as former governors Nelson Rockefeller of New York and Tom Kean of New Jersey , as well as Whitman 's own parents and grandparents . Some conservatives regard her as a closet Rockefeller Republican , still fighting a rear-guard action against the ideology of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan . <p> Whitman says she thinks she can be a leader of the national party . But that , she says , " will depend on whether I get re-elected . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two races : one against McGreevey , and one against the myth of her own popularity and the expectations it raises . <p> Many outside New Jersey , seeing Whitman 's fellow politicians fawn over her , think she 's wildly popular at home . But she holds only a 7 percentage-point lead over McGreevey , according to a Quinnipiac College poll . And her approval rating has fallen about 10 points in the last few months , to just over 50% , according to polls by Rutgers University 's Eagleton Institute of Politics . <p> Eagleton 's Janice Ballou notes that Whitman only beat Florio by 1 percentage point . Since then , she says , " She 's never really pulled in other constituencies . " <p> But she will suffer in national esteem if she does n't blow out McGreevey  --  even though Democrats have won five of the past six statewide races and only 20% of New Jerseyans are registered Republicans . <p> Whitman knows the pitfalls of high expectations . In 1990 , in her first statewide race , she threw a scare into the seemingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand on Florio 's tax hikes . Some think Bradley 's national reputation never recovered . <p> McGreevey , 40 , is an energetic campaigner , but Whitman may look better once voters learn more about him . He voted for Florio 's tax increases and Whitman 's tax cuts ; his wife has left him , accusing him of neglecting his family for politics ; and , as a union-backed Democrat , he seems an unlikely proponent of fiscal austerity . <p> Gerald Pomper , a Rutgers political scientist , says he suspects McGreevey ca n't hurt Whitman . " What is he going to charge ? That she found a way to cut taxes without hurting government services ? " <p> Still , money issues make New Jersey voters mad and incumbents nervous . Gov . Whitman can see the faded stickers on some of those expensively insured bumpers in front of her . <p> Their message : DUMP FLORIO . <p> THE WHITMAN FILE <p>  --  Born : Sept. 26 , 1946 , in Oldwick , N.J. <p>  --  Family : Married John Whitman , a financial consultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor .
