<p> EDROY - While crops throughout the Coastal Bend slowly wither in the drought , a thundering diesel engine on Erich Schneider 's farm sucks 1,400 gallons of water per minute from a well and sprays it over a mile-wide circle . <p> Cotton plants growing in the circle will yield about two bales per acre , while those growing beyond the irrigation spray will probably make one-half bale per acre . <p> If it does n't rain by Tuesday , most of the Coastal Bend will have gone 90 days without measurable rainfall . <p> Every field is different , with some hanging tough , but more than one milo patch north of Edroy has shriveled to the point that dead leaves glisten in the sun and stalks are falling over , signifying a total loss . <p> The plants of this feed grain topple when their water-starved roots deteriorate to the point they no long provide support . Like corn , milo plants die from the bottom up . <p> The coastal farmers who have pioneered irrigation in this area , like so many other growers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period when the federal government is phasing out its safety net and the weather seems to have gone haywire . <p> Disaster payments , in which the government doled out money following a drought , are a distant memory . Even price supports are being phased out , which makes farming more risky than ever . <p> This year 's drought follows too closely the drought of 1996 . " The main thing is to levelize our income - these ups and downs are just killing us , " Schneider said . <p> " We may not make a lot of money ( because of the high cost of the system ) , but at least we do n't lose , " he said . Neither he nor Adams is able to irrigate nearly as much as either grows . <p> The need to protect crops from such weather is increasing while the supply of water in the state , coveted by cities with zooming populations , is shrinking . <p> Growth in irrigated acres basically has topped out , said Guy Fipps of the Agricultural Engineering Department at Texas A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more than 6 million acres in the foreseeable future . <p> " The reason is simple ; we do n't have any more water , " he says . <p> Underground water levels in the High Plains , and even in East Texas around Longview and Tyler , are declining . The water rights in all but a few sections of rivers and streams in the state have been assigned , he said . <p> Some types of irrigated crops , such as rice along the upper coast , are in decline , Fipps said . Rice is a big user of water because farmers utilize flooding as a way to kill grass and weeds . <p> The big changes in the future will be in the types of irrigation used , he said , as growers switch from low-water-efficiency types to high-efficiency types . <p> A handful of farmers , including Schneider and neighbor James R. Adams , are pioneers in the major crop-growing area north of Corpus Christi in installing center-pivot irrigation systems . Prior to that , these long sections of elevated pipe were unknown in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Patricio County , about 30 miles north of Corpus Christi , is considered a marginal area for irrigation because the water contains more salt than is ideal . The danger of buildup of salt in the soil is one of the reasons pivot circles were n't seen on the flat landscape there until recently . <p> There are about 15 circular irrigation systems now in the Sinton-Mathis vicinity , estimate their owners , who are predicting more as neighbors are won over . Coffee-shop criticism about " expensive playthings " died down as the weather got drier , Schneider said . <p> Adams cites the failure of flood irrigation about three decades ago as a reason for apprehension by other farmers . <p> The clayish soil there absorbs too much when water is run down the furrows , he said ; if it should rain , plants could drown . A farmer could end up harvesting less than if he did n't irrigate . With sprinklers , you can put out as little water as you like , Adams said . <p> Schneider 's system was installed in April 1997 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-mile long and covers about 512 acres in one circle . The typical cost for a system this size is about $ 185,000 , Schneider said . <p> His system is totally automatic , to the point that it can be told what to do with a cellular telephone . Wheels along its length are powered by electric motors . <p> Many farmers lease their land , which means that they need to convince the landowner to make a major investment . The irrigated land that Schneider uses is owned by an Anheuser-Busch beer distributor in Corpus Christi . <p> A neighbor of Adams , who has not installed irrigation equipment , questioned whether his property was big enough to accommodate a half-mile system . While he probably could put in a quarter-mile long system , he feels the cost of this smaller unit would be nearly as high as the bigger one that covers four times more ground . <p> Not everybody can swing the financing needed to drill a well because land often has existing loans against it . Financing the irrigation system is easier , by comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The cost of installing irrigation ranges from $ 700 to $ 900 per acre , said Adams , which amounts to " buying the farm again , basically . " It will take seven to 10 years to pay for the irrigation system , but the stability it provides should be worth the expense , he said . <p> The area receives 29 to 30 inches of rain per year , enough to grow cotton , milo and some corn , but it often turns too dry at a crucial time . It 's the old story of needing " just one more rain . " That happens even in the Brazos River Valley , which gets 40 inches a year , said Fipps . <p> Agronomist Juan Landivar of the Texas A &M; Agricultural Center in Corpus Christi predicts " a lot more " irrigation for the area , in part because a boll weevil eradication program and insect-resistant cotton varieties mean farmers who make the investment wo n't just be feeding insects with the extra plant growth . <p> Not everybody in the area will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water is just too salty and too deep , said county agent Harvey Buehring in Robstown . <p> Irrigation in this part of the state is considered supplemental , unlike in the upper Panhandle , where farmers would n't even think about growing a crop without it . <p> Well over 1 million acres of corn in Texas currently are irrigated , said Jerry Don Glover of the Texas Corn Producers Board in Dimmitt . Because of high yields , 65 percent of the state 's corn production comes from irrigated fields . <p> The 200 bushels per acre that can be harvested in the Panhandle tops the average in the Corn Belt , Glover said . <p> Center-pivot irrigation systems , which blanket the Panhandle , are visible evidence of farmers trying to irrigate more land with less water . From an airplane , they stretch as far as you can see . <p> Watering a crop by flooding the furrows requires the equivalent of 10 to 20 inches of rainfall , while sprinkler irrigation can do the job with the equivalent of five to eight inches , said Ronnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. , which sells the Zimmatic brand of center-pivot system . <p> In the South Plains area around Lubbock , center-pivot systems are being sold virtually as quickly as they can be built , Setliff said . Irrigated acres have been increasing to the point that 70 percent of the cropland in Lubbock County is now watered , said county agent Mark Brown . <p> The unfortunates without irrigation have n't even been able to plant their cotton crop so far , because the soil is so dry . Some took a chance by planting in dry soil , hoping a rain would provide enough moisture for the seed to germinate . <p> To utilize the tight supply of ground water , some Lubbock-area farmers have reopened abandoned wells and tied together five or six , some no larger than a domestic home well , to provide enough water to operate one small pivot . The smaller-sized systems use a quarter-mile-long pipe . <p> A few growers have even put in super-efficient drip systems , which also are the most expensive , on small fields of 20 to 40 acres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid 12 to 14 inches into the soil , deep enough to allow shallow plowing over them . <p> In the Winter Garden , where controversy has arisen over underground water , center-pivot systems are considered water conservation equipment and will be eligible for low-interest loans starting in August , said Tammy Valentine , spokeswoman for the Edwards Aquifer Authority in San Antonio . <p> The authority is in the process of permitting water rights , based on previous use . Farmers will have until Aug. 6 to protest the amount permitted . <p> An innovative portion of the water conservation effort in the Winter Garden , called the dry-year option , will pay farmers not to water crops during dry years . Authority directors decided not to use it this year because of the permitting process , she said . <p> One farmer in Medina County already has sold his farm to the San Antonio water system for its water rights , Valentine said . The farmer sold his land for $ 600,000 , then leased it back for $ 50,000 . <p> " People are already cutting deals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water rights has yet to be determined . This is considered desirable because marketing water is the intent , she explained .
