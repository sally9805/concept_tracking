<p> You 're walking down a trail in Mesa Verde National Park and something on the ground catches your eye . It 's a piece of broken pottery - discarded , perhaps , by one of the Anasazi Indians who lived in the region some 800 years ago . <p> Thinking the artifact would make a nice memento , you surreptitiously pick it up and pocket it , only to discover on returning home that it has become less a souvenir than an eyesore . <p> Out of context , the potsherd no longer seems noteworthy or even attractive . Sooner or later , it ends up not in a place of honor on the mantel , but in a shoebox in your closet , a discard once again . <p> The scenario is played out in countless ways this summer , as tourists everywhere succumb to the souvenir-hunting impulse . In some places - on a beach strewn with driftwood , for instance - carrying off some of the scenery might be a relatively innocuous act . But in national parks , monuments and historic sites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region , such petty pilferage diminishes the nation 's rich heritage of natural and cultural resources . <p> Eventually , rangers fear , the plundering could prove the wisdom of the old admonition that if everyone took something , there 'd be nothing left to take . <p> " There are all sorts of impacts that seem relatively small from an individual standpoint , but which , multiplied by millions of people , could have a serious impact , " said Dan Huff , assistant regional director for natural resources in the Denver office of the National Park Service . <p> " I know it sounds trite , but especially along roads or trails and in campgrounds , the sheer number of visitors is affecting the landscape and the natural systems . " <p> Some effects are startlingly evident , others quite subtle . <p> At Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument west of Colorado Springs , for example , meadows that once were littered with pieces of petrified wood - even whole logs - have been picked so bare that little remains except a handful of huge stumps . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much we 've lost in terms of hard numbers or poundage , but people have really altered the scene of what was here , " said chief ranger Maggie Johnston , who has documented many of the losses with before-and-after photographs . <p> " The real loss is in the fact that these fossils are n't renewable . They 're not like a plant that 'll regrow when you pluck a leaf . When they 're gone , there are no more . If each person takes a 1-pound chunk , and you have 100,000 visitors , as we did last year , it will all be gone in a certain amount of time . " <p> Sometimes , the urge to bring home a trophy is so strong that visitors inexplicably take items they could easily find elsewhere . Earlier this summer , someone at Florissant lugged off what the ranger described as " just a big 50-pound rock . " <p> At Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona , officials have worked aggressively to head off looting by posting signs and arming lookouts with binoculars and radios . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years ago , recalled veteran investigator Bill Tanner , a ranger at the exit station tried to up the ante by rigging a fake theft detector out of an old voltmeter . <p> " He 'd flip a switch and the meter would flip back and forth . It was all completely bogus , " Tanner said . " Then he 'd say , ' Sorry , folks . Looks like you 've got some petrified wood in your car . ' And 99 times out of 100 , they would . " <p> Florissant 's Johnston said people who visited the Arizona park 25 years ago and have gone back recently report that " the areas within easy walking distance of the parking lots are picked pretty clean , so it has taken on the appearance of a place with just a few big scattered logs . " <p> Retirees chief suspects <p> A social scientist who did a survey of such looting found that " some of the main suspects " were retirees on tour buses , she said . At Florissant , they tend to be families with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misdemeanor tickets , " Johnston said . " What moves me is if they have attended our interpretive talk and have our brochure , and still go out and willfully take something just to see if they 'll get caught . " <p> In the Four Corners area , professional pot hunters with backhoes already have stripped many ruins of valuable artifacts . But casual collecting of mere fragments of pottery poses a threat as well , because it can rob sites of important clues to when they were inhabited , by how many people and for how long . <p> " I 've gone up on a site on public land where a teacher had a class of schoolchildren , and each one had a grocery bag , picking up shards like mad , with no idea that this was improper , " related Ricky Lightfoot , vice president of programs for the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center in Cortez . <p> " There are tens of thousands of sites in this county alone , and 99.9 percent of them will only be known from what we can see on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selectively remove things from the surface , it dramatically reduces what we can learn from the site . " <p> The National Trust for Historic Preservation views looting by tourists as so widespread and serious that it has placed the entire Four Corners region on its list of " most endangered " historic sites . <p> Rick Moore of the Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust , whose research helped prompt the designation , estimated that there are 2 million archaeological sites throughout the Colorado Plateau , ranging from " places where somebody sat down and flaked out a few arrowheads " to full-scale masonry structures . The great majority , he added , remain undiscovered or unexplored . <p> " Say you 're out walking through the woods and you come on an archaeological site where there are a lot of pieces of black and white pottery mixed in with plain red utilitarian ware , " Moore said , outlining the implications of unbridled souvenir-hunting . <p> Leads to false conclusion <p> " If everybody picks up the black and white because it 's more attractive , then an archaeologist who comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site never had any trade with outsiders . That 's why people should n't collect potsherds . It skews the information that can be derived from a site . " <p> Even moving rocks from a fire pit can be harmful , he noted . Left in place , they can enable archaeologists to determine when a site was occupied , using a process in which metallic particles in rocks are examined for signs of changes in the earth 's magnetic field . <p> It would be impractical , as well as prohibitively expensive , to fence off or install electronic monitors as a way of deterring further destruction at such sites , park service officials say . <p> Instead , the agency is attempting to promote " good visitorship " with a series of educational seminars for tour-bus drivers , motel clerks , gift-shop employees and other people who deal with tourists around the Four Corners region . Sessions are planned in six cities this summer , to be expanded to 15 next year . <p> " The main point will be to acquaint the workers with some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are asking visitors to do - or not do - certain things at archaeological sites , " said Moore , who is developing the training sessions under a $ 20,000 grant from Mesa Verde . <p> " We want to not just say , ' Do n't climb on the walls , ' or ' Do n't build a campfire , ' but to explain why - that it causes erosion or obscures evidence . " <p> The ecological consequences of souvenir-hunting are harder to assess than the aesthetic or archaeological , but they bear mention as well . <p> Huff pointed out , for example , that elk and deer in Yellowstone need calcium to grow antlers - calcium found in the plants they eat , which absorb the mineral from the soil . If the tons of antlers shed by the animals are n't left on the forest floor to decay or be recycled by rodents , but instead are retrieved by humans , the calcium levels in the soil could eventually decline , leaving the deer and elk population undernourished and weakened . <p> Similar imbalances , Huff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about any element from a natural ecosystem , be it the pine cones necessary for new tree growth or something as rare as a midget faded rattlesnake , which has recently become a target of snake hunters in Utah . <p> In any event , it is normally illegal to remove natural , cultural or archaeological resources from the national parks , which have been set aside by congressional mandate to be preserved " unimpaired for future generations . " Violators can be charged with a petty offense under Section 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations , or in the case of artifacts found on federal or Indian lands , prosecuted under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act . ( Researchers who obtain permits from the land managers involved are exempt . ) <p> The penalty for the least serious offense can be as much as a $ 500 fine and six months in jail , plus court costs . For ARPA violations , the penalty is as much as a $ 10,000 fine and a year in prison for cases in which the value of the item and cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 20,000 and two years in prison for cases that exceed that threshold . <p> A second offense under ARPA can net as much as a $ 100,000 fine and five years in prison , while the fine for multiple offenses can be as much as $ 250,000 . <p> " Generally , if you pick up a bag of pine cones and take them home , we 're not talking about a serious crime , " said Tanner , a New Mexico-based ranger who spends most of his time tracking down commercial pot-hunters and wildlife poachers . <p> Weightier case <p> " On the other hand , if I caught a guy and his wife and kid loading 75 or 100 pounds of petrified wood into a car , that would be a different story . " <p> Todd Metzger , a resource management specialist in the Flagstaff office of the park service , said visitors who take things from the ruins at Wupatki , Walnut Canyon and Sunset Crater National Monuments in Arizona tend to fall into three categories : <p> Those who pick up shards of pottery or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile " or " museum rock " along a trail . <p> Those who retrieve such items and bring them to rangers and " show them the neat thing they 've found . " <p> Those who collect artifacts , rocks or other materials and take them home . <p> Such plunderers damage the archaeological record , Metzger said , by taking the resources out of their proper context . Nevertheless , he noted , " We encourage people to return artifacts even if they have to send them by mail . It 's important to get the materials back , because there 's still some archaeological benefit that can be derived from them . If nothing else , they can be used in a touchy-feely box , so people can pick them up and see what they feel like , and maybe be discouraged from taking them home . "
