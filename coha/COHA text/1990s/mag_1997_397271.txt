Science Far From Settled <p> The announced objective of the 1992 Global Climate Treaty ( officially known as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ) is to " achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system " ( emphasis added ) . <p> The problem for policymakers is that no one knows what constitutes a " dangerous " concentration of greenhouse gases . There exists as yet no scientific basis for defining such a concentration , or even of knowing whether it is more or less than current levels . Just the same , efforts are now under way to establish a protocol for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases , focused mainly on carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) from the burning of fossil fuels by agriculture and industry , electric power plants , home heating and cooking , automobiles , and other road and farm vehicles . <p> To reduce CO 2 effectively , such an emission-control scheme , with its legally binding targets and timetables still to be decided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on much of humankind . It risks ruining national economies , driving manufacturing and other industrial operations into less developed and less regulated countries ( with the perverse effect of destroying the environment in those countries ) , and ultimately costing citizens hundreds of billions of dollars . <p> Regulatory costs , although initially borne by industrial and agricultural producers , will eventually be passed along to consumers in higher prices . The loss of jobs , combined with a higher cost of living , will cause severe hardship , especially for the poorest among us . Such economic sacrifices can not be justified by current scientific evidence . Indeed , scientists continue to put forth new theories to try to account for the fact that global temperature is not rising , even though greenhouse theory says it should . <p> The Global Climate Treaty , signed at the 1992 " Earth Summit " in Rio de Janeiro , rests on three propositions that are either questionable or demonstrably false : The Climate Treaty supposes that a human influence has been detected in the climate record of the last 100 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warming . But the climate has not warmed significantly over the past half-century , and not at all over the past 20 years , in contrast to theoretical predictions . It further supposes that any future warming would produce catastrophic consequences , including droughts , floods , hurricanes , rapid and significant sea level rise , the collapse of agriculture , and the spread of tropical disease . But the recorded climate record of the past 3,000 years appears to dispel that . Historically , warmer temperatures have been , on the whole , beneficial for human welfare and the development of civilization . It presumes  --  with no scientific definition  --  to know which atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases are " dangerous " and which are not . To stabilize CO 2 concentration at present levels , 30% above pre-industrial values , would require a drastic reduction of emissions and energy use  --  more than 60% worldwide . But again , the historical record indicates that higher levels of CO 2  --  and they have been much higher in the past  --  may in fact provide benefits . Some scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father of greenhouse warming , have speculated that some of these benefits have already turned up in improved agricultural yields . <p> Let 's take a broader look at these points . The main conclusion of the UN-sponsored science advisory group , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , is that " the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate . " This artful but essentially meaningless phrase has been misread by policymakers as proof that computer models predicting a warming of 1 Degrees to 3.5 Degrees Celsius by the year 2100 have been validated . Such confusion is understandable . The IPCC Policymakers Summary juxtaposes that phrase with the results of climate model calculations of future warming , even though such a connection is specifically denied in the body of the 1996 IPCC report . <p> Such misinterpretations to the contrary , the global temperature record of this century , which shows periods of both warming and cooling , can best be explained in terms of natural climate fluctuations , caused by the complex interaction between atmosphere and oceans , and perhaps stimulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate system . <p> Climate is Forever Changing . We start with the observation that climate is forever changing , in many cases for reasons that we do not yet understand . External changes are brought about by the variability of the sun , by volcanic eruptions , and , more rarely , by impacts of large asteroids or comets . But on the timescale of years and decades , the most important changes arise from complicated interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean ; the El Nino events that cause global changes in temperatures and rainfall are a good example . <p> On a longer timescale , the Earth has experienced some 17 glacial episodes  --  Ice Ages  --  in the past 2 million years . The variability of this past climate can be demonstrated by examining tree rings , ice cores , and ocean sediment cores , all of which show evidence of large and rapid temperature changes , even in recorded history  --  i.e. during the past 3,000 years . " Global " thermometer records have been available only since about 1880 , and even today large portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitored . It is only in the past 20 years that we have had truly global temperature data of the lower atmosphere from weather satellites . <p> Here is what the temperature data tell us : There was a sharp warming from about 1880 to 1940 , which is generally assumed to be a natural recovery from the " Little Ice Age , " a period of much colder temperatures that began around 1450 . After the 1940 peak , temperatures fluctuated , generally declining till about 1975 when there may have been a sudden increase . Surface thermometers show such an increase lasting into the middle 1980s ; satellite data , however , backed up by observations from balloon-borne instruments , show no increase whatsoever since 1979 , and even a slight cooling . <p> There is still fierce debate about the discrepancy between surface data and satellite temperature trends , but there is considerable evidence that the surface-based thermometers , generally located at airports near cities , have been contaminated by the " urban heat island " effect , which produces warmer temperatures locally . Climate records corrected for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the 1980s . <p> Computer Models Do n't Work . Three-dimensional climate models that run on fast computers , the so-called General Circulation Models ( GCMs ) , have become much more sophisticated but still do a poor job of representing the atmosphere . Their results differ widely , some showing a warming of 1.5 Degrees C or less , others of 4.5 Degrees C or more . Because these models suffer from poor spatial resolution  --  about 300 km  --  and an incomplete knowledge of cloud physics , computer modelers can not depict actual clouds but must instead " parameterize " cloudiness , which accounts for much of the wide range of GCM results . The GCMs also implicitly incorporate a positive feedback from atmospheric water vapor ( the most important greenhouse gas ) , which greatly amplifies the effect of a CO 2 increase . In reality , the feedback may well be negative instead of positive . <p> The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has tried to explain the discrepancy between observed and calculated temperature changes . In its first assessment , in 1990 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calculations to be " broadly consistent . " <p> The second and most recent assessment , published in 1996 , no longer uses this phrase . Instead , the IPCC tries to explain the difference between observations and theory by introducing the cooling effects of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols , i.e. particles derived largely from sulfur pollution produced by burning coal . It reduces the calculated " best " warming trend from 0.3 Degrees C down to 0.2 Degrees C per decade , which is still in disagreement with the satellite results . The IPCC also appeals to a supposed similarity of observed and calculated temperature patterns and concludes that " the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate . " This ambiguous phrase has been widely used to argue that the climate models produce results validated by observations . The models are still inadequate in representing the real atmosphere , however , and no such validation has occurred . <p> Just a year after the IPCC published its 1996 report , it has become apparent , on the basis of more recent computer studies , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and theory ( projecting a 0.2 Degrees to 0.3 Degrees C temperature increase per decade ) can no longer be explained by the assumed cooling effects of sulfate aerosols . <p> So what could be causing the gap ? One set of explanations relies on effects internal to the models , principally their inadequate treatment of clouds and water vapor . It is thought that , if the models are improved , the positive feedback from water vapor would be reduced , or even reversed , resulting in a climate sensitivity ( i.e. , temperature increase for a CO 2 doubling ) of perhaps less than 1 Degrees C. Such temperature changes would be barely detectable in view of the " noisiness " of the natural variations , and would be quite inconsequential in their impact on climate . <p> The other set of explanations relies on external effects , principally caused by the 11-year cyclical variations of solar ultraviolet radiation , or on the corpuscular emission from the sun , the so-called " solar wind . " Ultimately , these solar variations produce changes in cloudiness or in atmospheric ozone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These two sets of explanations have very different consequences , and call for very different policy responses . With the science largely unsettled , there is urgent need for further research . <p> Rising Temperatures Could Have Positive Effects . Possible climate changes from human activities need to be considered from the perspective of natural changes . The geologic record shows natural changes that were larger and more rapid than those now predicted by many computer models , and certainly larger than can be expected on the basis of extrapolation of observed temperature trends . Nevertheless , one should examine the potential impact of even a moderate temperature increase . <p> Judging from the climate record of the past 3,000 years of human history , climate consequences of a greenhouse warming should be generally beneficial . One would expect severe weather to be less frequent because of ( calculated ) reduced equator-to-pole temperature gradients . In fact , the frequency and intensity of hurricanes have decreased over the past 50 years , although the reason for this is not known . <p> The most feared consequence of global warming has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooding and the disappearance of some islands . But new research indicates that increased ocean evaporation would lead to more rain  --  and therefore to more ice accumulation in the polar regions . As such , sea levels may actually drop . An empirical study of sea level change and sea-surface temperatures of the past century appears to point in that direction . <p> As far as agriculture is concerned , the combination of warmer weather and increased CO 2 would be beneficial . More CO 2 promises rapid plant growth and , at the same time , reduced water consumption because of reduced evapo-transpiration from leaves . The climate warming that has been calculated would be most noticeable at higher latitudes , primarily in the winter and at night , and would result in fewer frosts and a longer growing season . Farmers can adjust to local climate changes  --  as they have in the past  --  with improved technology and proper crop selection . ( See box , above , and " The Great Promise of the Greenhouse Effect , ' " CR , June 1997 . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread insect-borne tropical diseases . This neglects the fact that insect control and public health are the primary determinants of such diseases , and that , with cheap and rapid mass transportation , the human vector is becoming increasingly important . One is reminded that frequent epidemics of malaria and yellow fever occurred in the United States and even Northern Russia when the climate was much colder . And it 's worth noting that wealthy Singapore , situated at the equator , does not share the widespread tropical diseases prevalent in poverty-stricken Africa . <p> Higher CO 2 Levels May Not Be Dangerous . ' One of the often expressed concerns has been that ongoing atmospheric changes could reach a " dangerous " level that might cause climate to become extremely unstable , or precipitate a sudden switch to a new climate state that would be detrimental to human existence . <p> Again , looking at the climate record , there have been many large climate fluctuations , but nothing that would lend support to the idea of a climate " surprise . " If anything , the variability of climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 levels were less than 200 parts per million , than during the most recent 11,000 years of the warm interglacial ( the Holocene ) with CO 2 levels at 280 ppm . <p> The geologic record does not indicate that CO 2 levels higher than the present level ( of 350 ppm ) would be " dangerous . " In fact , some 500 million years ago the planet experienced CO 2 levels as high as 15 times the present level : they have been declining ever since , reaching a secondary peak of about 1500 ppm some 200 million years ago . <p> If we can not tell whether higher levels of carbon dioxide are better or worse than present or pre-industrial levels , there is little point to mounting elaborate schemes to control CO 2 emissions . <p> Drastic Reductions in Energy Use ... The IPCC has determined that maintaining the present atmospheric concentration would require that CO 2 emissions be reduced by well over 60% worldwide and kept at that value . Any lesser reduction would only slow down the ongoing increase of CO 2 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 550 ppm , much talked about in the IPCC report , would require a CO 2 reduction of some 50% , with a corresponding reduction in the use of energy . <p> When the Conference of Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change ( Global Climate Treaty ) held their first meeting in Berlin in 1995 , it was decided to exempt , or at least defer , developing countries from the obligation to stabilize or reduce CO 2 emissions . But since their emissions will very rapidly exceed those of industrialized countries  --  by the year 2010  --  emission control schemes become purely a political exercise without any scientific basis . <p> This is quite evident from the fact that there is no scientific guidance on how to define and avoid a " dangerous " level of CO 2  --  the announced goal of the Climate Treaty . <p> ... And Huge Economic Burdens on the Poor . Reducing the emission of CO 2  --  or even stabilizing CO 2 at the present level  --  would put huge economic burdens on the industrialized nations and their citizens . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations to buy unused permits from developing nations , this may do little to reduce global emissions . Depending on how national emission quotas are set , emission trading may simply develop into a giant scheme to transfer wealth between nations , or  --  as some have put it  --  taking from the poor in the rich countries and giving to the rich in the poor countries . <p> It is , of course , obvious that oil-exporting nations will suffer economic losses if demand is reduced by industrialized countries . It is less well known that developing countries , relying on trade and foreign investments , may also incur losses if the economies of the industrialized nations falter . <p> There is considerable concern that imposing energy restrictions will not only raise energy prices to consumers , but cause industries to transfer operations to nations that do not incur these restrictions . The current U.S. administration has attempted to reassure the Congress that economic losses will not occur or will not be too severe if they do . But if it becomes apparent that a global warming could produce net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to construct a benefit-cost analysis to convince the public and the Congress to go along with restrictions on energy use through what amounts to a hidden energy tax . <p> Adapting to Climate Change . The recommended policy to meet any consequences of growing atmospheric greenhouse gases is to rely on human adaptation to any climate change , coupled with a " no-regrets policy " of energy conservation and increased energy efficiency . ( " No-regrets " energy policies are those that make economic sense even if no climate change occurs . ) Common sense is the key . Over-conservation can waste energy if it destroys energy-imbedded capital stock that requires new energy expenditures to replace ( see " Energy Conservation Does n't Happen , " CR , October 1997 ) . <p> Adaptation has been the traditional method of meeting climate changes ; one that has worked over thousands of years for human populations that were not as technologically advanced or as materially endowed as those at present . The resources saved by not restricting energy use through rationing or taxing can be applied to make human societies more resilient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , any effects from climate change over the next century will be minor compared to societal changes brought about by new technology , rising incomes , and population growth . Avoid Hasty Action We have not been able to define scientifically the goal of the Global Climate Treaty , namely the greenhouse gas concentrations that may be considered " non-dangerous . " A higher CO 2 level may turn out to be preferable to a lower one . Postponing action by 10 years or so will not appreciably affect future temperatures . A number of economic arguments have been advanced why it pays to postpone action on limiting emissions , without compromising the ability to act later . Chief of these is the fact that capital equipment can be replaced at lower cost with a more efficient unit after it wears out . Another reason is that we will learn more about the underlying climate science and be able to make more rational decisions . Benefits of Carbon Dioxide <p> Little , if any , of the $2 billion-per-year global-change research budget has been used to identify , document , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere , or of any of the other consequences of man 's activities . This bias in itself has contributed greatly to public perception that these activities pose serious threats . That there are benefits from adding CO 2 to the atmosphere is undeniable : Fertilization of the Biosphere : CO 2 is essential to plant life . At the last glacial maximum ( 18,000 years ago ) the CO 2 level dropped to about 190 ppm , which is close to the level where plants would begin to experience propagation failure . Longer Frost-Free Growing Season : Any greenhouse warming will reduce radiative cooling of the surface , thus will be greatest in winter , at higher latitudes , and at night . As indeed observed , minimum temperatures will be affected much more than maximum temperatures , leading to longer frost-free growing seasons and little , if any , additional summer-afternoon heat stress . Greater Water Efficiency for Plants : Except in the already arid subtropics , precipitation is predicted to increase . In addition , increased CO 2 allows plants to ingest the CO 2 they need with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive with less water since less is lost by evapo-transpiration . Health : Increase of minimum temperatures with little effect on maximum temperatures will be beneficial both in reducing cold stress and the requirements for space heating . Dr. Sherwood Idso has suggested that " the significant downturn in circulatory heart disease experienced worldwide over the past two decades " is a possible consequence of the 25% increase in CO 2 in the atmosphere . Respiration is controlled by the concentration of CO 2 ( rather than of oxygen ) in the blood ; thus CO 2 - stimulated deeper breathing may have reduced the strain on the circulatory system . Farming the Ocean ? <p> In spite of the absence of observed global warming , and in spite of the expectation that warm temperatures would likely produce net benefits , governments may still feel politically compelled to reduce the ongoing increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide . As an alternative to controlling emissions , the idea of sequestering CO 2 from the atmosphere by creating tree plantations has been widely discussed . <p> An equivalent scheme  --  potentially more effective and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the absorption of excess CO 2 into the ocean . It has been successfully demonstrated recently that fertilizing certain regions of the ocean with micronutrients , like iron , can significantly increase the populations of phytoplankton . In addition to enhancing a basic food source for fisheries , ocean farming can also serve to absorb atmospheric CO 2 . In short , it may soon be possible to turn excess CO 2 into a resource , making it no longer an alleged menace . <p> By S.
