<p> Whether or not it 's true that New York is dying , as widely advertised , Paris can claim to be proof that big cities do n't have to . It runs well , delivering the amenities and pleasures of urban life perhaps better than any metropolis in the world . <p> The first time I came to live here , in the mid-1960 's , a New York friend commiserated . " It 's dirty , " he said . <p> " What 's more , they carry the bread around unwrapped . " <p> French bread still comes naked , but the streets are clean now , pristine compared with large parts of New York . A special service called " Proprete de Paris " ( cleanliness of Paris ) sends squads of men around in bright green coveralls to make sure . Sometimes they have little electric carts with hydraulic scoopers and automatic brushes , sometimes huge vans to haul away debris . <p> The French do still overindulge their dogs , it 's true . There are signs pointing to the gutter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people do n't bother . But the parks , often locked at night , are carefully maintained and safe . Many major intersections are ringed with bright flowerbeds , seasonally renewed . <p> Public transport works , and the metro is neat and quiet . People are n't afraid to enter it . Mail is delivered two or three times a day in business areas ; there are no more of the little " petits bleus " messages delivered pneumatically because the postman was n't reliable . Telephones are excellent , including a computerized service for information and reservations . <p> It is n't the old slovenly Paris anymore . High school students are out in the streets again now , marching and shouting and blocking traffic , but peacefully . If revolution means something drastically different , their demands are revolutionary  --  wardens to prevent violence in the schools , repair of poorly maintained buildings , more teachers . One of their slogans reads , " We want to study . " No more 1968-style tearing things up . <p> There is crime , of course , but most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been taken over by vandals and muggers , and they are n't allowed to become garbage dumps lined with derelict buildings , though much of the housing is very old . A lot of 17th- and 18th-century buildings that had become tenements have been handsomely restored . <p> And there is racism , mostly anti-Arab because of the many North African immigrants . But it is n't the pulsing , unavoidable undercurrent of the city 's life , the constant , malevolent shadow it has become in New York . Maybe that 's because of numbers ; Arabs are estimated at no more than 5 percent of the metropolitan area 's population  --  official statistics do n't allow a racial tabulation . Or maybe it 's because they are relative newcomers , trying to make their way . <p> New Yorkers I know put up cheerfully with dirt and danger that would have appalled Dickensian London . They have a kind of Victorian attitude about it , insisting that the city remains the greatest , and the only thing wrong with it is " some parts of town " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which makes it harder to understand why they let it deteriorate . <p> The art and the music , the variety and excitement , are indeed world class , but the city is a strewn battleground , not up to its reputation . Like people in the Middle Ages , they cultivate their tastes so inured to the ravage around them that they scarcely notice anymore . It is n't inevitable . Revival is possible . <p> As the capital of a highly centralized nation , Paris has advantages  --  especially financial  --  not available to New York . The national Government pays nearly a quarter of its budget , and a lot of services that American cities have to provide come under state responsibility : education , most welfare , much of the police force . Local revenues are n't all gobbled up by the basics . <p> But city administration and public attitudes do make a difference . After the rebellious Commune of 1870 , Paris was n't allowed to elect a mayor for fear of the capital 's challenge to thestate . It was n't until 1977 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been running for president of France for nearly a generation , got himself elected and re-elected Mayor , and set out to show he could handle the country by doing an energetic , bang-up job in Paris . <p> He 'll probably never be president ; his niche in French politics is n't big enough for that . Meanwhile , he has straightened up the city and enabled the qualities of urban life to overwhelm what can be disadvantages . Perhaps New York should choose more ambitious politicians . There are so many differences , though , the comparison is n't worth much . <p> Still , it 's sad to see New York run down and scared , picking its sprightly way around the bodies sleeping in the street . If old Paris can be made to hum , why not New York ? It deserves to do better for itself .
