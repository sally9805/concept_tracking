ON THE INTERNET , WHEN PEOPLE want to chat about the bleaker side of life , they often find their way to alt.support.loneliness . The forum , a Usenet newsgroup , is open 24 hours a day for anyone who wants to post messages lamenting a breakup with a spouse , or how tough it is to meet people or find true love or even a true date . It 's a moderately popular group . Or it was , before the Carolinian Lords of the Caucasus showed up . <P> The CLOC , an unabashedly white-supremacist organization based in Columbia , South Carolina , takes pride in running locals off certain innocuous parts of Usenet with its race baiting . Members claim to have emptied out half a dozen forums already , including , improbably , alt.fan.barry-manilow and alt.food.dennys . " If you want an organization which makes things happen , visit our victims and learn first-hand what kind of a group we are , " they boast at their World Wide Web site , which features an image of a burning cross . " CLOC is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domination of the Internet . " <P> This virtual hooliganism may sound absurd . For people who rely on the Internet to communicate , though , it 's a real and growing problem . Like more conventional groups , racists have discovered that the Net is a marvelous way to get their message out to a huge audience at low cost . Last week the Simon Wiesenthal Center , the world 's largest Jewish human rights organization , decided that enough is enough . Citing " the rapidly expanding presence of organized hate groups on the Internet , " Rabbi Abraham Cooper , the center 's associate dean , sent letters to hundreds of Internet access providers , asking them to help draft a code of ethics that would squelch Websites that promote bigotry and violence . <P> Predictably , civil libertarians are uneasy about the proposal , seeing it as yet another assault on free speech in cyberspace . Congress has already signaled its intent to enact legislation that would criminalize " indecent " speech online , rather than adopting the less onerous restriction against " obscene " speech that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter is very much in keeping with the Constitution and traditional media practice . He argues that the First Amendment also protects publishers who choose not to disseminate materials they find offensive . Most mainstream newspapers and magazines , for example , wo n't run ads from racist or hate groups . The people who sell access to the Internet , he believes , should start behaving the same way . " In effect , " says Cooper , " this is a recognition that the Internet has come of age . We 're not looking for prior restraint or to keep these guys off the Internet . We 're saying , Adopt the same approach to the First Amendment that your brothers have done in traditional media . " <P> Among purists , though , the whole point of the Internet is that it is n't like traditional media . A wide spectrum of viewpoints is tolerated and even encouraged online , especially on the freewheeling , anarchistic Usenet . The notion is that for the first time in history , anyone can express his or her views to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stirring up opposition from cyberspace denizens on both the left and the right .
