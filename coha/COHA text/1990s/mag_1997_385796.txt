Undersea Noise Experiments Threaten the Sensitive HearingAnd CommunicationsOf Marine Mammals // Anyone who has ducked beneath the surface of the ocean is familiar with the sensation . The screech of gulls , the laughter of children in the surf , even the distant whine of pleasure craft are all shut out for the moment . But , in fact , the oceans are full of sounds , most of which are inaudible to human ears . Because water is a very efficient conductor of sound waves , moving them at five times their airborne speed , it is no surprise that some sea creatures have capitalized on the use of sound for navigation and communication . While flippered animals such as seals , sea lions and walruses have shown some proficiency utilizing underwater sounds , the real stars of underwater acoustics are the finned marine mammals , including whales , porpoises and dolphins . These animals not only use sound to locate prey ( and each other ) , but some evidence suggests that they also communicate in a code of clicks , whines and squawks that scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , only half of the picture . These marine mammals must also have hearing sensitive enough to discern these signals , sometimes over great distances . Bottlenose dolphins , for example , have been tested to have a normal hearing range of frequencies from 200 to 150,000 hertz ( Hz ) . Humans , by comparison , hear only between 20 to 20,000 Hz . Such sensitivity to sound has left marine mammals vulnerable to the manmade hazard of underwater noise pollution . Military , industrial , and scientific activities all do their part in contributing to the racket beneath the sea . The U.S. Navy , for example , is preparing an environmental impact statement on the sub-surface noise generated by a new submarine detection program . To improve detection of the new breed of quieter submarine , the Navy hopes to employ a low-frequency active sonar array . As opposed to passive sonar , which simply listens for unnatural sounds , active sonar produces a low-frequency signal ( between 75 and 1,000 Hz ) to create echoes off of hostile submarines . These signals , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced at 230 decibels ( dB ) , well above the noise level of a jet engine ( 120 dB ) . On the Pacific coast , scientists studying global warming are also adding to underwater noise while hoping to get accurate readings of the oceans ' temperature . But gathering this data requires the use of sonar on a large scale . The $40 million acoustic thermometry of ocean climate ( ATOC ) program of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , California hopes to capitalize on the fact that sound travels through cold water faster than through warmer water . By tracking the variations in the time it takes a 75 Hz tone ( within the hearing range of many marine mammals ) to travel from a sonar transmitter in California to a receiver 6,000 miles away , the ATOC program can begin to plot the changes in ocean temperature over time . // Finned marine mammals like these dolphins are especially sensitive to sonic disruptions . // At their source , ATOC 's sonars , in action since December 1995 , produce a deafening 195 dB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 dB . Even at half-a-mile 's distance , the transmissions register at 136 dB , still louder than a jet engine . In addition , although the decibel level will drop with distance , the frequency remains the same . This means that marine mammals in the sound 's path may not be subject directly to a loud noise , but suffer consistent exposure to low-frequency sound waves . It is still unclear what long-term effects such programs will have on the sensitive hearing of marine mammals . In a study published by the Naval Health Research Center , scientists found that 24hour exposure to low-frequency sonar at only 77 decibels produced " adverse effects on health , performance , and morale " on human sailors . Response from environmental groups has been swift . The Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) is worried about the global scope of the program , which could affect as much as 80 percent of the planet 's oceans . Joel Reynolds , an NRDC senior attorney , says , " We simply can not afford to play Russian Roulette with our global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in coalition with a number of other environmental groups to keep tabs on government and industry underwater sound generation . According to Joan Hartmann of AOC 's Senior Policy Council , " What marine mammals in the Pacific Ocean experience now is akin to living next to a freeway with the window closed . " While that may not seem too dramatic at first , Hartmann adds , " We do n't know what that level of sound means to marine mammals-creatures who are very dependent on their hearing . " Concern for marine mammals by environmental groups has led ATOC to set up a sister program , the Marine Mammal Research Program ( MMRP ) , to monitor the ATOC 's effects . Dr. Christopher Clark of Cornell University 's Bioacoustic Research Program , is leading the MMRP to try to determine the hearing capabilities of marine mammals and sea turtles , and to measure their response to man-made sounds . The MMRP 's six-month summary report claims , " In all types of data collection programs ... no significant effects on marine animal abundance or distribution as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound programs , however , are designed with the idea of helping marine mammals . Dr. Jon Lien of Newfoundland 's Memorial University has developed a localized underwater acoustical alarm to help North Atlantic commercial fishermen solve the problem of the unintentional by-catch of marine mammals , such as harbor porpoises . By attaching " pingers " to the nets of commercial fishing boats , marine mammals are alerted to the net 's presence without scaring away targeted fish species such as cod . So far , the experiment has been successful . According to Dr. Lien , the data " overwhelmingly indicated that the devices worked to reduce by-catch . " The ratio of marine mammal by-catch in unalarmed nets to alarmed nets was 20 to 1 , a stunning success . Although the increase in noise beneath the surface of &gt; the oceans is a serious problem , careful research and planning can help to ensure that vulnerable species are protected . Marine mammals live a life that is finely attuned to their environment , and they can use all the help they can get to ensure that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
