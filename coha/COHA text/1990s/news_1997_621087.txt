<p> The scene happens nearly every day : Martha Schwartzmann has just parked her new Honda and within seconds , she and it are surrounded . <p> " How fast does it go ? " " Is it really running ? " " Is this a Honda ? " " Where do you plug it in ? " That 's right . Plug it in . <p> Electric cars are not that new , but until now they have either been conversions of gasoline-powered cars or homely little creatures that look like overgrown toasters with a bad paint job . <p> Schwartzmann 's Honda EV- Plus , like General Motors ' EV1 and the forthcoming Toyota RAV4-EV , is one of the new , factory-designed generation of EVs  --  electric vehicles . For once , they actually look and act like gasoline-driven cars . The big difference is that they do n't sound like them . <p> In fact , they do n't sound at all , and that is just one of the things that takes getting used to as these silent volt-sippers take to the highways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nascent culture of electric car owners  --  admittedly a small group , but then again it 's a bit like getting in on the ground floor of personal computers ( remember the first Apples ? ) . <p> " There 's all kinds of electric- vehicle slang I began to learn , " Schwartzmann says , " like ' ICE machines ' which I did n't know was slang for internal combustion engines until I went to the electric- vehicle people picnic . " And EV slang was n't the only thing the 53- year-old Sacramento attorney had to master . <p> " The very first thing I had to unlearn when I got in the car was not to crank the key , " Schwartzmann says . " It 's like a light switch . You just turn the key and it 's on , and that took some getting used to . And then after a few weeks of driving this car , I 'd get back into my other car ( a Chevy Blazer ) and say , ' Why is n't this car on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts and is practically allergic to petroleum does have other advantages , Schwartzmann says . <p> " No gas stations , no drippy oil junk all over the place . " <p> The Bay Area still has no factory-sponsored electric car programs because all those hills reduce the cars ' already limited range . But industry sources hinted broadly that within a year , at least one of the big automakers may start a Bay Area program midway between San Francisco and San Jose . <p> " We 're in the pre-prelaunch stage , " says Norm Stone , director of new energy markets for Pacific Gas and Electric Co . " Right now , we 're working with General Motors to coordinate a launch in the Bay Area and in Sacramento , and we 'll be putting on a ' ride and drive ' demonstration with GM this fall . " <p> In the Bay Area , the most noticeable electric car presence is the fleet of 36 CitiBee cars frequently seen parked at the Ashby , Walnut Creek and Colma BART stations . Made in Norway , the cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who use them to get to and from their homes . <p> Unlike the Honda and General Motors models , the CitiBee does not adhere to federal motor vehicle safety standards . It was given a waiver by government officials because the car is only in the United States temporarily , as an experiment , according to Nancy Collins , an Oakland consultant working on the program with BART . Under the waiver , the cars must be returned to Norway next spring , Collins said . <p> Owning an electric car is not for everyone . It costs up to $ 2,000 to have the local utility install a special battery charger at your home ( it takes six to eight hours to fully charge Schwartzmann 's Honda , which can go 100 miles between charges ) . <p> A typical charge , using lower- cost off-peak electricity , runs from $ 1.20 to $ 1.50 . On average , that 's much less than the price of gas  --  a compact car that gets 25 miles per gallon would use four gallons of gas , about $ 5.60 worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the 100-mile range , it takes planning to own one of these cars ; it is definitely not for cross- country drives . It is designed to be an in-town commuter and errand- running car , and the manufacturers wo n't let you lease one unless you also have a gasoline-powered car for those longer trips . <p> Those who do sign up to own one of these cars essentially become volunteer field testers for the factory . New electric car drivers agree to be evangelists for the world of volts and amps  --  the owners pass out pamphlets to the curious and they willingly talk to reporters . <p> The cars are only sold on a three-year closed-end lease , at a monthly fee of $ 499 . After three years , you have to give back the car . Mel Rapton Honda , the exclusive distributor of electric cars in Sacramento , will only lease to people who live within 50 miles of the dealership . The factory provides 24-hour roadside service , comprehensive and collision insurance ( the owner pays for liability ) and also provides all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honda comes with nickel-metal hydride batteries  --  they 're said to be worth $ 30,000  --  and if there are improvements in battery technology , Honda will retrofit the car with the better batteries . <p> Given the hefty monthly fee , not just anyone can afford one of these cars . <p> " Honda qualifies people for these leases , " Romer says . " They look for demographics , they want to know that your debt-to-income ratio is enough to make the payments . And they want homeowners so they can have electrical outlets put into the houses . " <p> CART BEFORE THE CAR ? <p> It is the charging outlets , or lack of them , that control the range of electric cars ( you ca n't hitchhike to the nearest station and pick up a gallon of volts ) . In an effort to make the cars more independent , the state 's big utilities are cranking up for the advent of this new wave of transportation by installing chargers at strategic urban locations . <p> So far , it has been a cautious minuet  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money on chargers unless they know the car companies will bring their products to market ; the carmakers say they wo n't sell them unless they know the utilities will lay down a network of charging stations . <p> " The manufacturers want to place vehicles in certain areas because of demographics , climate and topography  --  flat and hot because batteries work better in these conditions , " says Kateri Callahan of the Electric Transportation Coalition , a trade group based in Washington , D.C. " The community has to be willing to be electric- vehicle ready , and this is largely driven by the local electric utility . " <p> It appears that GM , Honda and the other big automakers have left the cottage industry side of the electric car market out in left field . But one of the nation 's biggest independent manufacturers says the arrival of the big guys is not such a bad thing . <p> " They 're inevitably going to enter this market and we 're not naive enough to think we can compete with them , " says James Worden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass. , firm that has made and sold 350 converted and rebuilt Geo Metros since 1992 . " But we do n't mind . If anything , it boosts the industry . Automakers can team with us for lower-cost manufacturing and marketing because we already have the components and the expertise . " <p> While most experts say the real market for electric cars is the state 's vast legion of urban commuters , one Los Angeles executive thinks he has found a great little two-for-one reason to have an electric car . <p> Since January , David Hardin , executive vice president of Hawthorne Savings Bank , has been driving his bright red General Motors EV1 on the daily 60-mile round trip between his home near the beach and his office in El Segundo . <p> " You ca n't drive down the street without people pointing at it , pulling up to it , crowding around it , " he says . And it does n't hurt business at all that on the car 's hood and its two flanks are big blue logos with the words " Hawthorne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so unique  --  it attracts a lot of attention , " Hardin says . " It costs us about $ 6,000 a year , which is about $ 100,000 cheaper than a billboard on a crowded street .
