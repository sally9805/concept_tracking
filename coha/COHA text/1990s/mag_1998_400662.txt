Rub on a preventive " shield " and poison ivy wo n't get under your skin . // Finally , a sure-fire way to avoid getting poison ivy . Think about it : No more rash , no more oozing blisters , no more itch that can turn even the most placid and subdued person into a crazed , teeth-gnashing fiend who 'll sell soul and future for a few moments relief And it was right under your nose all the time : Move to Antarctica . There you go . Of course , you may he allergic to penguins but life 's not perfect . If it was , there would be none of this dreaded plant life lurking along trails , just waiting for a hapless hiker to wander by , brush against the leaves , then spend the next week or two scratching like a flea-infested hound . And despite the legions of backwoods lovers whose mantra is " Leaves of three , let it be , " many still somehow manage to encounter poison ivy and are forced to try and cope with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the ivy-covered tunnel , however , because medical science has been hard at work developing ways to keep the itch at bay . Prevention , after all , is far better than trying to claw the skin off your bones . THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM The poisonous weeds in question grow in all Lower 48 states ( Alaska and Hawaii are safe ) , and take the form of either a small shrub or a woody , ivy-like vine . East of the Rocky Mountains you 'll find poison it , in the West it 's poison oak , and in wet areas of the Southeast poison sumac . The name is n't as important as what 's lurking in and on all three : urushiol , a usually colorless ( sometimes light yellow ) oil that 's quite potent . Two to 2.5 millionths of a gram can trigger a reaction in highly sensitive people , which is about 50 percent of adults in the United States . Another 35 percent react to larger concentrations of urushiol . Sensitivity to the oil is the single most common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the leading cause of worker 's compensation payments related to outdoor injuries . When urushiol soaks into human skin an allergic reaction takes place . Not everyone reacts the same , but most people first develop redness where they contacted the oil , usually in the form of streaks where the plant brushed against the skin . It takes varying amounts of time for the reaction to show up . On thickskin areas of your body , such as palms and the bottoms of feet , the oil soaks in more slowly than on thin-skin areas like arms and legs . If you 're highly sensitive , you 'll see the dreadful signs in 2 to 6 hours . Those who are less sensitive may not show symptoms for days , or in some cases , for up to two weeks . For most people , though , 12 to 48 hours is all it takes to know whether the next 10 to 14 days will be cursed ( and have you cursing ) . Adding insult to injury is the fact that places on your body previously affected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urushiol contacts a distinctly different part of your anatomy . There may be some swelling . Blisters eventually erupt and discharge fluid , which crusts over in the final stage of this very unpleasant chain of events . And as for the Big Question : No , the blister fluid does n't cause the rash to spread . What usually happens is the urushiol gets on your hands , you touch yourself , and that 's how the rash shows up in all those odd places that never see daylight , much less come in contact with plants . The best plan of attack is avoidance , but with urushiol , it 's what you ca n't see that can drive you mad For instance , even if you 're wearing long pants and sleeves you can get a rash on your body because the oil can get on your clothing and boots . You get home , remove your footwear , the oil gets on your hands and voila ! ( Urushiol stays active for years , by the way . ) Then there 's the sad tale of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighboring county . While wearing shorts on a recent hike he stopped for a rest break , surveyed the area for dangerous plants , and saw none . He confidently rested against a tree the wind recently toppled . Three days later , when the backs of his legs were aflame with the rash and massive blisters , he realized that once upon a time , poison ivy vines had thrived on the tree 's bark , leaving behind-you guessed it-lots of urushiol . The moral : Avoidance is a fine idea but if you 're highly sensitive , you ca n't take chances . You need to lower your risk factor , and here 's where science comes in . For years researchers have been trying to develop a " barrier " cream that when applied to skin , will block or at least hinder absorption of the irritating substance . No luck , until 1995 when the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology ( Volume 33 , Number 2 ) reported on a successful barrier cream study . A lotion made of an organic clay mixture was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women who were sensitive to poison ivy . One hour later urushiol patches were taped to both forearms and left in place for four hours . After the patches were removed , both arms were washed with liquid detergent and water . The results : 68 percent who had reactions on unprotected forearms suffered no reaction on protected arms . Those who did have a reaction on their lotioned forearms had significantly less irritation compared to the unprotected arm . In 1996 the proven formula , dubbed IvyBlock Lotion , was introduced to the market . For almost two years it was the only barrier-type agent available that had the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seal of approval . This past spring a new FDA-sanctioned player called Work Shield emerged . Being the curious type , I got samples of both , and here 's what I learned . IvyBlock : The instructions say to apply to the skin 15 minutes before treading where poisonous plants live . I coated one arm with the stuff , and found it to be virtually invisible with a mild but not unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier , " I was n't surprised that my treated arm remained slightly creamy to the touch . The manufacturer recommends reapplication every 4 hours during times of exposure . If you sweat heavily , you should be okay because there 's a bonding agent that 's supposed to help the lotion stay put . Wash off with soap and water after the danger has passed . A 4ounce bottle costs around $12 and can be purchased at most drug stores or larger supermarkets . Contact EnviroDerm Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , P.O.

According to an Avon spokesperson , it 's simply IvyBlock marketed through the SkinSo-Soft line of products . The reason : to reach more families . " Price is the same .

As a bonus , it 's FDA-registered not only as a barrier cream , but also as a treatment to help stop the itch and dry up weeping blisters . Like IvyBlock , it should be washed off after the threat has passed . A 4-ounce bottle costs around $12 . Contact : Dermaron Corp. , P.O. Box 3012 , Peabody , MIA 01961 ; ( 888 ) 4896625 . Reader service #107 . Now for the question I know you 're dying to ask : Will they prevent the torturous itch ? To find out I stripped naked , smeared myself with each , vigorously rolled in poison oak for 20 minutes , then ... just kidding . Actually , my curiosity only goes so far . But since both are FDA approved , that means the feds are satisfied that each stands up to the stated claims . NIP IT IN THE BUD Besides using a barrier cream , there are other lines of defense in the itch wars . Of prime importance is washing as soon as you realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't required , since even the extremely sensitive have 5 to 10 minutes before urushiol soaks in enough to cause trouble . Those of lesser sensitivity may have up to 2 hours . Use cold water and lots of it ; avoid hot water because it softens and spreads the oil , and opens skin pores . As for soap , no need to use it if you act within the first 3 minutes of contact . Many dermatologists , however , do recommend washing with some type of cleansing agent or detergent if more than a few minutes have passed . If you 're highly sensitive , repeated washings are n't a bad idea . Organic solvents like alcohol and gasoline , while usually not readily available in the wilderness , work even better than soap and water . Lacking those , you can use stove fuel . Repeatedly dab the exposed area with pieces of solvent-soaked cotton , then rub with fresh solvent-soaked cotton . Do n't leave the gasoline on your skin but for a few seconds , and avoid using the same piece of cotton for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your skin . The National Safety Council , being a cautious bunch , says you should conclude by washing five to six times with soap and water , then rinse with rubbing alcohol , followed by clear water . You may notice commercial products on drug store and outfitter shelves that claim to wash off urushiol , and often , the accompanying itch . Before buying , check the label and see if the product is FDA approved . If not , you decide whether it 's worth the gamble . Most are little more than a soap-based liquid anyway , and some even tell you to scrub the rash with their product . I 've never done this , but I talked to a few folks who have and they told me the obvious : rub and scrub itchy skin and it 'll itch even more . Be sure to clean under fingernails where urushiol may lurk . You can also pick up the oil from your clothing , the bottom of your tent , your hiking staff , even the hair of your dog or cat . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your clothes and gear a good washing once at home . RASH RELIEF Sometimes , despite your best preventive measures , you learn about a poisonous plant encounter after it 's too late . Although nothing will cure the rash , you can try to relieve the itch . First a note about what probably wo n't work . Avoid topical lotions , creams , or sprays that contain antihistamines or anesthetics , since the additives have a tendency to make things worse . Most topical corticosteroids sold over the counter are too weak to do much good . Aspirin , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( such as ibuprofen ) , and oral antihistamines have little or no effect , although an antihistamine might help you sleep . Your physician can prescribe a strong topical steroid that may help if you start using it before the rash turns into blisters . As for homeopathic treatments , there are over 100 different folk remedies involving substances provided by Mother Nature , but all are scientifically unproven and most seem to have little effect . There are two plants , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckhorn , has leaves that release a pale green sap when crushed . When dabbed on the rash , the sap reportedly stops the itch for 24 to 48 hours . Jewelweed has as many supporters as plantain . The sap from crushed plants can be applied to the rash , and some claim relief after soaking in bath water mixed with the juice of approximately one pound of plants . Other home treatment options I 've heard folks swear by : * Topical applications of plain old calamine lotion . * Soaking in a tepid bath with one cup Aveeno brand oatmeal or two cups of linnet starch added . * A cold , wet compress placed on the rash area . Some sufferers get relief by standing in a hot shower for several minutes , then gently patting the water off the itchy areas . If a close encounter with urushiol causes you to feel ill , there 's significant swelling , or the rash is in a particularly sensitive area , forgo any attempts at self treatment and high-tail it to a doctor for medical attention .
