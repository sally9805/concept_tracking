SUPREME DRAFTSMAN ANTONIO LOPEZ CAPTURED FOR ETERNITY THE LIFESTYLES AND , MOODS OF THREE DECADES <p> UNTIL HIS EARLY DEATH IN 1987 , Antonio Lopez , known simply as Antonio , wets the world 's foremost fashion illustrator . His vigorous style , synonymous with dynamic line and vibrant color , conjures up images of agressive good looks and a frenzied baroque lifestyle characteristic of the second half of the twentieth century . The indelible mark of this Puerto Rican laureate artist was underscored last year when the Fashion Institute of Technology ( FIT ) hosted an encyclopedic exposition in New York City entitled " Art Fashion . " Focusing on the pantheon illustrators of this century  --  everyone from Paul Iribe to Cecil Beaton  --  this event showed Antonio to be one of the last great voices of a dying art . <p> In the 1920s and 1930s Erte and Benito ( from Russia and Spain respectively ) created styles that were widely imitated and were definitive reflections of their times . In their hands illustration took an unprecedented turn . Throughout the world , from Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their immediately recognizable creations . Likewise , in the 1960s Antonio established himself as the reigning arbiter , giving fashion a much needed impetus . As art historian Herbert Muschamp succinctly put it , " Antonio used enchantment to break the spells of racial prejudice . The enchantment was that of beauty ... he never stopped looking for it and never stopped finding it . " Antonio also summed up the moment through his unmistakable iconography , becoming the embodiment of everything that was " in " from the 1960s to the 1980s . He often used his magic to transform the work of well-known clients such as Rudi Gernreich , Yves St. Laurent , Valentino and Zandra Rhodes . <p> Although FIT did a major Antonio retrospective in 1975 , a more comprehensive one was arranged posthumously in 1987 . Starting in New York , this show , which includes his commercial as well as fantasy works , has toured Tokyo , Milan , Philadelphia and Los Angeles . This fall it is slated to travel in Australia to Melbourne , Sidney and Brisbane . Arrangements are being made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1993 . Like the revivals of Art Nouveau and Art Deco , the return of the ' 60s and ' 70s is already here and , not surprisingly , Antonio is one of the prime luminaries . <p> Antonio 's early youth was decidedly more sober than his fast-paced , globe-trotting latter life . He was born in the Puerto Rican farm country of Utuado in 1943 . The marriage of his parents , Francisco Lopez and Maria Luisa Orama , was arranged by their families when they were 17 and 14 respectively . A precocious child , the first of three sons , Antonio was always attracted to visual things . He started to draw at the age of two , teaching himself the essentials of a craft that only needed to be elaborated . Antonio 's mother was his first model . A seamstress by profession , she was an extraordinary beauty and the child loved to sketch her while she was busily making clothes . He would arrange artfully the leftover cloth she gave him on makeshift stick figures and then draw them . He quickly developed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiat surface of paper by carefully observing how garments were worn . Another early influence was the pageantry of the Catholic Church with its many festive holidays and dramatic processions such as those of Holy Week . Antonio 's roving eye took note of the blue of the Madonna , the red of the Sacred Heart and the purples that seemed to permeate the entire spectacle . " I was brought up a Catholic , but since my father was a spiritual healer I was also influenced by white magic and its mystical aura . " Those who knew him well say that the elder Lopez , who was a farmer by profession , was primarily a santero and a highly respected one . This coupling of orthodox Catholicism with native folkloric sensibility accounts for much of the dynamism and radiance that is an integral part of Antonio 's work . <p> Antonio also remembered his father as being strangely encouraging to his fashion work  --  he often gave him dolls instead of baseball bats . When he was five , the family moved to San Juan where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not go to school until age eight , when the family moved to New York City . He loved to tell the story of how his father had to resort to trickery to get his family to join him " up north . " Having made the decision to settle in New York and knowing that the family would not adjust easily to such a drastically different climate and culture , he decided to send them a postcard of Miami which he had purchased in Florida while serving in the military . The card , depicting gorgeous tropical gardens drenched in copious sunshine , arrived with the inscription " Greetings from New York . " From that moment on , Antonio 's dream was to join his father in that utopia he thought existed in el norte . When he finally arrived , in the dead of winter in sub-zero weather , he was totally unprepared for the tall buildings and gray atmosphere of his new home in Spanish Harlem . <p> Although the experience proved to be traumatic for such an imaginative child , Antonio soon grew accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual dexterity , promptly learned a new trade  --  he began to create store mannequins . The process of molding plaster and subsequently applying paint fascinated Antonio , who decided that this occupation could open new creative possibilities . After school he joined his father to help put hair on the mannequins . " I was exposed to fashion through my mother , and through my father I was able to create doll-like objects and style them . It was a wonderful time for me  --  my fantasies were fulfilled . In most other respects I led a very ordinary life , playing baseball and doing things normal kids do . But I always thought my home more exciting . " <p> His mother , whom he considered his first makeover , fully blossomed at the age of 28 when , according to Antonio , she became incredibly beautiful . " She was the kind of woman who exuded sex . It was all learned . So I found out early on that with very little you can go a long way , and that 's what I tell all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsession for shoes , which was manifested in innumerable drawings , was kindled by his mother 's penchant for collecting them . In school , Antonio sought out the most beautiful girls and they responded to him because of his sensitivity . " I knew what they liked and how to please them . While other boys were too busy intimidating them or teasing them , I was charming them ! " <p> When he was 11 Antonio had a brief stint as a tap dancer , performing for a year on children 's television . Nevertheless , he soon returned to his all-consuming passion for drawing . Winning innumerable awards , he was encouraged by his teachers to pursue a career in the arts . As a student at the New York High School of Art and Design , he already possessed a fluidity of style that was later to become his trademark . In 1960 , at age 17 , Antonio enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology . He was one of the youngest students to be accepted and the illustration department , noticing his outstanding talent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIT , Antonio persistently visited the offices of editor Rudy Millendorf at Women 's Wear Daily ( WWD ) , then a great bastion of style . Showing a growing portfolio , he begged for the opportunity to get a foot in the door of this powerful journal . He was finally given a job illustrating hats and accessories . As his work became more impressive , the resident illustrators became increasingly jealous . Eventually his unmistakable graphics caught the eye of the editor of the New York Times Magazine , Carrie Donavan , who had the brilliant idea of having Antonio cover important Broadway openings . Antonio 's innovative illustrations of celebrities attending these premieres began to appear regularly in the Times . By this time he was considered the star illustrator at WWD and its publisher , John Fairchild , would not allow him to freelance for other periodicals . An ultimatum was presented : he was to work exclusively for WWD or there would be no more assignments . Antonio , who felt this would limit his artistic growth , chose to leave and consequently became persona non @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , his departure from the " bible of fashion " paid off because it led to other far-ranging projects on the international scene and contracts with important publications , designers and firms . <p> Antonio 's key words were beauty , volume and shape . Throughout his life he worked three-dimensionally , often altering , fitting and redoing the garments that he was about to draw . Although the idea of actually creating clothes was always at the back of his mind , he never started his own line . " To me , the human body is n't naturally sexy . The clothes are responsible for making us aware of our sexuality , while nudity leaves little to the imagination . It 's like truth when it 's so obvious  --  there 's no room for anything else . Clothes give us many choices and possibilities . " <p> The late 1960s were frantic , as well as prolific , years for Antonio , whose Broadway apartment doubled as a studio . Preferring to work through the night and sleep until noon , his schedule was usually of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating a major book on his fashion philosophy entitled Antonio 's Girls , a delirious interpretation of 1001 Arabian Nights , and lecturing on fashion at colleges and universities . Frequently his work took him to other countries . From 1969 to 1975 he lived in Paris where he collaborated closely with luminaries such as Karl Lagerfeld , Kenzo , Yves Saint Laurent , Thierry Mugler and Claude Montana . His apartment on the Rue de Rennes became a center for wayward models , many of whom went on to become internationally recognized . Among his Galateas were actress Jessica Lang , disco diva Grace Jones and model Jerry Hall . The latter reminisced about working with Antonio in the early years . " Antonio really taught me everything . He would n't pick up a girl who did n't have some sort of personality . He 'd teach you what to do with your hands when you were posing . I learned how to do makeup from the way he drew me . I 'd sit with his drawings of me and copy the makeup exactly . " <p> Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of cult proportions that took root in Tokyo , where he was received like a movie star or political hero . Artist Philip Smith commented , " the Japanese study Antonio 's work for hours , reading his map of American culture , deciphering the social code that can be traced in the eyes , the nose , the hair , the posture and the movement . " His numerous visits to Japan were celebrated with sell-out exhibits of his drawings . <p> Nevertheless , Antonio remained loyal to his adopted home , the Big Apple . " My inspiration comes from all over but my true energy has always been here , and my years in Paris only helped to reinforce my belief that my creative force springs from the vitality of New York City . " Living in this world capital also enabled him to maintain a close cultural proximity with his Caribbean homeland  --  he never forgot that he was boricua . Although fame came to him at an early age , he always encouraged beginners , especially Latin Americans , towards whom he felt a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trademark signature actually encompassed two individuals : Antonio Lopez and Juan Ramos . Juan , also a native of Puerto Rico , was referred to as Antonio 's alter-ego and " engineer of the impossible . " They met when both were studying at FIT , shortly before Antonio 's career took off with his debut at Women 's Wear Daily . Of the two , Antonio was the flamboyant one , inspiring countless photographers to pose him with some of the world 's most striking women . On the other hand , Juan remained the silent partner , preferring to stay out of the limelight . A man of exquisite taste and art director par excellence , Juan has a mind that never stops generating ideas . He is a former Alvin Nicolai dancer who has not lost the muscular agility nor the mental discipline required to perform the most demanding tasks . Designer Charles James summed up his attributes , " his supreme talent is to make order out of the chaotic inspiration of other artists ... all of whom must , because of their nature , work under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equate the emotional with practical issues , a mountain which all artists with the same problems must face . " <p> Many people , including Antonio , benefitted from Juan 's valuable suggestions . " He and I blend our observations , " said Antonio in 1976 . " There are no rules . Often Juan  --  whose insights are keen-steers me in the right direction . Over the years he has been my backbone , even by putting me down . " Since the unfortunate early death of his associate put an end to their rich collaboration , Juan has been busy giving lectures , organizing exhibitions and keeping the name alive , while making sure details are correct . An element he feels was fundamental to Antonio 's style was his Latin sensuality , an ingredient , heretofore , missing in the fashion world . What was refreshing about the Antonio/Juan team was that , in spite of their popularity , they never became jaded . Instead , they approached their craft as a never-ending , learning experience through which they clearly saw so much of the falsity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest mentor in Charles James , the only recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship in the world of fashion . James , whose clothes were akin to great paintings and architecture , refused to compromise with commercial considerations and thus had great appeal to the iconoclastic younger generation who saw in him a rebel . This septuagenarian designer was equally impressed by the Puerto Rican duo . " In my distraught , if super-colorful life , both Lopez and Ramos have played more important roles than any of the so-called self-styled fashion experts , whose approval of my work so often seemed to condemn it as worthless . " <p> Currently Juan is putting together the catalogue raisonne of his deceased partner . The opus will be organized into three volumes corresponding to the three decades in which Antonio reigned . Each decade seemed to bring out something unequivocal in Antonio . In the ' 60s he created galvanic drawings that captured the vigor as well as the explosiveness of that period , including a series that was commissioned by the New York Times Magazine . These svelte figures strongly resemble the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work also had a timely " Pop " quality , with a scattering of psychedelic elements that made it highly suitable for the poster art then in vogue . <p> In the uncertain , nostalgic ' 70s the experimentation went even further . Antonio added more color and movement to the ever changing complex schemes and actually drew with lipstick , mascara and nail polish . He also went through a phase which emphasized his superb sense of line . The incorporation of photography was another addition to an already mixed media . He and Juan started an obsessive collection of candid shots of their friends which now constitutes an unusual record of those times . Paloma Picasso , Giorgio di Sant ' Angelo and Marisa Berenson gladly disrobed and appeared in bathtubs for these spontaneous pictures . Valentino posed with a plastic bag over his face ; Andy Warhol , Margaux Hemingway , Halston and countless others appear in equally provocative shots . Warhol shared with Antonio a certain mask of passivity and notions about the artist 's life as a work of art . It is unclear which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admired the fiat , dumb quality of the resulting pictures , which " arrested instantaneously the evanescence of our lives . " There is also a large collection of conceptual series photographs that are on a par with the best work of Les Levine or Dennis Oppenheim . <p> The extravagant ' 80s were to witness some of Antonio 's most powerful work , with even more explosive color and some of the most vivacious schemes ever concocted . His schedule continued at the same frantic pace . During this time he set up two fashion workshops in the Dominican Republic , bringing in thirty students from the United States to work with local recruits . He also continued his magazine work , including a large assignment for Vanity in Milan . Then an unfortunate turn of events took place in his life . Antonio became yet another victim of the devastating AIDS scourge . He chose to confront this tragedy in his own unique way . The chemotherapy treatment prescribed made him more ill and confirmed his decision to avoid conventional medicine and hospitals . Working strenuously every day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guadalajara for a remedy that actually made him feel better . He stopped in Los Angeles for the vernissage of an exhibition of his work at the Robert Berman Gallery in Santa Monica . With 1000 people attending the opening and a nearly complete sellout of the works on display , this show was an overwhelming success , Two days later Antonio died at the UCLA Medical Center , surrounded by friends . Artist Paul Caranicas recalls , " he looked grand until the end . " It was as if he had willed the ugliness to stay suppressed within . Somehow it was fitting that even in death a ruling sense of beauty should emerge in order to protectively cloak him . <p> Antonio 's manifold art left a considerable legacy . A large part of his success was due to a constant , restless experimenting and searching . He immersed himself in the essence of several mediums , borrowing and learning from the mainstreams of art  --  nineteenth century Japanese prints , German Expressionist painting , Botticelli and the pre-Raphaelites . Explaining the sources of his inspiration , Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Leonardo da Vinci , yesterday it was Elizabethan costume and the day before it was what some guy was wearing at the gym . My use of the period ideas has nothing to do with adapting a certain style or look . Instead , it forces modernism to go somewhere else . To become more than it is . " Ultimately , it was a process of reshaping the world . <p> It has been said that one advertisement by Antonio could sell 300 skirts in one department of one store in one day . Those who sought his services were primarily interested in the merchandising of their products , but whether they realized it or not , there was a serendipitous fringe benefit attached to the contract . Decidedly going beyond the commonplace , Antonio created a vital and timely vision , and the designers whose work he illustrated were thus assured a piece of immortality . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Drawing from the New York Times Magazine , psychedelic issue ( 1967 ) above .
