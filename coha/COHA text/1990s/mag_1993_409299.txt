Elizabeth David died last year , leaving many legacies to people interested in the history of food and its preparation . Her books on France and Italy , on spices and on bread , set a standard for scholarship and sensitivity for the burgeoning tribe of gastroethnographers who followed her . Perhaps one of them will complete her unfinished last work , a study of the origins of ice cream . Some of it appeared in a series of articles in Petits Propos Culinaires , beginning with the very first number of that learned , yet spry , publication in February 1979 . " Hunt the Ice Cream " scrutinized three early English ice cream recipes . In the next few issues of PPC , David looked into manuscript evidence about such related arcana as fromages glaces and the caves where ice was stored before refrigeration . She delved into the greater mysteries of premechanical ice cream freezing and the containers and molds and bombes from the dawn of modern ice cream in the eighteenth century and earlier . David was so prolific in this area that PPC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The editors were " waist-deep in ice cream , " as they put it in a note in PPC announcing a special supplement to incorporate a treatise on " Ice Cream and Water Ices in 17th and 18th Century England , " by W.S. Stallings , Jr. , a pewter collector whose holdings in antique ice cream molds had led him to do historical research . I began rereading David 's ice cream essays as a small act of piety and then found myself swept up in her learned inquiry . Like all first-rate scholarship , hers ( and Stallings 's ) raises many questions . It got me wondering , exactly how did our forebears serve ice cream ? I am not talking about the look of it or about visual presentation in general . David and her sources , with their many illustrations , tell us a good deal about that . And she was able to paint a very specific picture of how ice cream was made , even reprinting old recipes so that we can have a pretty fair idea of how a French chef 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put together in 1734 and how it might be reproduced today . What is largely missing from the PPC ice cream boomlet of those days is something so simple that cookbook writers then and even now hardly mention it . Should ice cream be served ( relatively ) hard or ( relatively ) soft ? Even the earliest recipes indicate , by their methods , that rock-hard ices or ice creams with nuggets of crystallized ice in them were considered undesirable , just as they would be now . David quotes La Varenne 's recipe for orangeflower snow ( neige de fleur d'orange ) from his Nouveau Confiturier ( ca. 1696 ) : " You must shake it from time to time for fear it will freeze into a solid lump of ice ( glacon ) ; it will take two hours . " Common sense tells us that no one ever intentionally put rock-hard ice cream in front of guests . On the other hand , there are early and contemporary examples of ices meant to be served as slush or , in the Near East , as cold drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true instances of normal ice cream or of the problems of serving temperature and solidity it presents . To specify a clear and universal standard is clearly impossible , and not only because fashions and tastes change or vary from person to person . ( This starts in childhood as a split between those who bite at ice cream in cones or on sticks and those who lick them . ) This is especially so since different kinds of ice creams are chemically and physically different enough to create individual criteria and freezing characteristics . Nevertheless , it should be possible to limit the investigation to mainstream cream/milk/egg/sugar ice cream and then look for consensus on serving consistency in printed sources and to conduct tastings with identical batches of ice cream served at different temperatures . What , then , do modern authorities writing scientific recipes have to say on this matter ? Madame Sainte-Ange 's bible of traditional French high bourgeois cooking ( La Cuisine de Madame Sainte-Ange ) is not much help . In the many astute pages she devotes to ice cream , the only specific indication she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation : " An ice cream may be served either molded or en roche arranged in spoonfuls scoops ? piled one on the other ; or by the spoonful in individual ice cream dishes . In the last two cases , the ice cream melts more rapidly than a molded ice cream , because it is less cold . But this relatively moderate temperature is appreciated by most guests . " Shona Crawford Poole in Iced Delights ( 1987 ) takes a roughly similar moderate position : " The aim is to soften it enough to scoop and serve . " These sources and many other mainstream cookbooks are essentially advising the minimum softness necessary to serve the ice cream and to get a spoon into it without effort . They never come to grips with the essential question : What degree of softness produces the best taste ? Or does this parameter matter at all to the perception of flavor intensity ? I have been able to find only one published opinion even indirectly relevant to this question . In the lead-in to her recipe for a Mogul watermelon sherbet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1985 ) writes : " Traditionally , it is served as an ice that is sipped , like a frozen daiquiri , while it melts under the blistering north Indian sun . " Although Sahni does n't actually say that she prefers the taste of melting , sipped sherbet , she does at least call attention to a cultural preference . But in the next sentence she goes on to say that in our cooler climate , solider sherbet eaten with a spoon makes more sense . Cultural relativism may be the best way out of the puzzle , but my own experience with ice cream in Western settings made me suspect that the ideal way to eat ice cream is as soft as possible  --  at the very edge of melting , before it begins to puddle on the plate , but only just before . This entirely subjective point of view rests on two extremely vivid encounters . In 1972 while wandering in the Savane , the main square of Fort-de-France , Martinique , I bought banana ice cream from a woman standing in direct sun with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was late in the day ; she had virtually sold out and the ice cream , when she removed the lid , looked almost like soup . But by searching energetically , she was able to produce two scoops still cold enough to hold their shape . I consumed them quickly with a plastic spoon . They were sublime . In the same year I was in a small and excellent old-fashioned restaurant in Lyon . On the table with the other desserts were several metal containers of ice cream surrounded by ice . The hazelnut ice cream that I ordered was perfectly soft , almost literally melting . Its taste was extraordinary . Were these reactions purely circumstantial ? Would those two ice creams have been just as good if slightly harder ? Obviously I ca n't say . But to test my very strong impressions that their softness was a sign of their organoleptic perfection , I recently compared several samples of Haagen-Dazs vanilla and chocolate ice cream at various stages of hardness ranging from just barely spoonable to completely melted . I chose Hagen-Dazs because it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial ice cream can to top quality handmade ice cream  --  no gross chemical tricks , no crass aeration . Also Hagen-Dazs sells its vanilla and chocolate in small containers that lend themselves to sampling and that react to change in ambient temperature more a quickly than larger batches . For the experiment , I left a vanilla and a chocolate container in the freezer at roughly 15deg F. I put one of each flavor in the refrigerator at roughly 44deg F. And I set out a vanilla and chocolate on a kitchen table . It was a cool evening and the air temperature measured about 62deg F. After an hour , I opened all the containers . Those that had been in the freezer could just barely be sampled with a large spoon , but they became slightly easier to attack as the testing progressed ( the entire proceeding lasted about fifteen minutes . The refrigerated pair had reached the conventional ideal . A spoon went easily in but they were still entirely solid and nondripping . The room-temperature pair were at marginally liquid but it was no trouble to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be called ice cream and not soup . I liked them all , but they did definitely seem to me to present an informal gradient showing an inverse relationship between solidity and taste : The more solid , the less dramatic the taste . When pressed very hard , my wife agreed with this view , but insisted that she found the " room-temperature " samples inferior because they " were n't ice cream . " What this admittedly very informal and limited test suggests is that cold tends to reduce the intensity of flavor in ice cream , but that for some people ( my suspicion is that this holds true for most people and that I am an exception ) the texture or mouth feel of ice cream is very important , perhaps slightly more important than pure flavor . This is a surprising result , since most of us have probably assumed that ice cream was interesting primarily as a vehicle for pure , almost abstract , flavor . Texture in ice cream was a secondary matter , and when it was considered at all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact ( or to put it another way , an undistracting backdrop for the circus of flavors at the ice cream store ) . I shall be very interested to hear from other people who try this experiment , to see if they agree or not . In the meantime , I propose a thought experiment . Remember the last time you made ice cream at home ? There came a time when the crank could n't be turned or the electrical freezer had ground to a halt . The half-frozen ice cream now had to be transferred to another container to be " seasoned " in an ice pack or in the freezer until it hardened to the consistency of " real " ice cream . But after you completed the transfer , the dasher or paddle that had been turning the ice cream inside the freezer had very soft ice cream left on its blades . When I was a child , I was given the dasher to lick . I continue this habit as an adult ( I mean I lick it myself ; children can wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are like me , this is the true moment of ice cream pleasure . The harder , " real " ice cream is never as good . TO ICE CREAM ( From Nathaniel Bailey 's Dictionarum domesticum 1736 , quoted by Elizabeth David in Petirs Propos Culinaires I , February 1979 ) Fill tin icing pots with any sorts of cream you please , either plain or sweetened , or you may fruit it : shut the pots very close ; you must allow three pounds of ice to a pot , breaking the ice very small ; laying some great pieces at the bottom and top . Lay some straw in the bottom of a pail , then lay in the ice , putting in amongst it a pound of bay salt ; set in your pots of cream , and lay the ice and salt between every pot , so that they may not touch ; but the ice must be lai 'd round them on every side ; and let a good quantity be laid on top ; cover the pail with straw , set it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it will be frozen in four hours time ; but you may let it stand longer ; and take it out just as you use it ; if you hold it in your hand and it will slip out . ELIZABETH DAVID 'S APRICOT ICE CREAM ( Slightly adapted from Summer Cooking , Penguin , 1965 ) 1 pound fresh apricots 3 ounces ( 1/2 cup ) sugar 1/4 pint ( British measure ; 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons U.S. ) double cream ( U.S. heavy ) 1 . Halve and stone the apricots . Steam them until soft and sieve them . When cold , add a syrup made from the sugar and 1/4 pint ( 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons U.S. ) water simmered for 10 minutes . Chill . 2 . Whip the cream . 3 . Immediately before freezing add the whipped cream . Freeze in foil-covered ice-cube trays for 2 hours , stirring twice during the press . ( David refers to electric and mechanical ice cream makers elsewhere in Summer Cooking as an alternative to this method . ) To make a firmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custard with the beaten yolks of 2 eggs . When cool , mix the apricot puree with its syrup into the cream custard . Add also a few of the apricot kernels , skinned and crushed .
