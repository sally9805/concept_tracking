<p> Want to make an impression at the company holiday party ? Consider showing up in a $ 27,500 Fendi white sheared mink coat . Around your neck , you could wear an $ 82,000 white gold and diamond pave link necklace with matching earrings ( $ 8,500 ) and bracelet ( $ 37,500 ) . <p> Paying for the outfit from the Saks Fifth Avenue catalog  --  dress and shoes not included  --  would take Dick and Gladys Rustay every penny of disposable income for 129 years and seven months . The Rustays , retired schoolteachers from North Carolina , sold all their worldly goods 10 years ago , gave away the proceeds and moved into the Open Door Community , a ministry of volunteers and formerly homeless people who live together in an old apartment building on Ponce de Leon Avenue in Atlanta and serve the poor . Their change in lifestyle shocked their parents and their children . <p> Each gets $ 50 a month to spend . They eat with other members of the community and wear castoff clothes donated to the ministry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need much , " said Dick , 69 , who is also an ordained Presbyterian minister . " We live fine . " <p> " We live a very middle-class life , if the truth be told , " said Gladys , 66 . <p> But theirs is an existence that de-emphasizes materialism , a sharp contrast during this wildest , buyingest , spendingest season of the year , all in the name of religious holidays . <p> But where does one draw the line ? Just how much is too much ? <p> For a vast majority of people , the answer lies somewhere between $ 82,000 necklaces and hand-me-down sweaters . <p> The authors of several new books conclude that Americans are becoming increasingly obsessed with possessions and the quest for more of them . Yesterday 's luxuries become today 's necessities , and tomorrow 's purchases have to be larger and more impressive . A public television special labeled the condition " affluenza . " <p> It once was an affliction of just the super rich . The late Aristotle Onassis , for instance , bought the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whales to cover the bar stools on his yacht , the Christina , according to Robert H. Frank in his book " Luxury Fever " ( Free Press , $ 25 ) , scheduled for release next month . " The Christina , " he writes , " was just one salvo in Onassis ' costly battle to outdo rival shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos , whose own yacht , the 375-foot Atlantis , was designed by an architect whose explicit instructions were to make it 50 feet longer than the Onassis vessel . " <p> Asks Frank , " Can anyone truly doubt that it would have been better to build each boat a little smaller , and use the money thus saved to provide school lunches for hungry children ? " <p> Maybe not . <p> But can anyone truly doubt an American family would be better off with one fewer bathroom in order that a homeless person might have a place to live ? <p> Maybe so . <p> At a time when the average family size is decreasing , the average house built in the United States today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Americans today are engaged in an upward spiral of " competitive acquisition , " according to Juliet B. Schor , a senior lecturer at Harvard University and author of the 1998 book " The Overspent American " ( Basic , $ 25 ) . " In recent decades , the culture of spending has changed and intensified , " she writes . " In the old days , our neighbors set the standard for what we had to have . They may have earned a little more , or a little less , but their incomes and ours were in the same ballpark . Their house down the block , worth roughly the same as ours , confirmed this . Today the neighbors are no longer the focus of comparison . " <p> The " Joneses " next door have been replaced by the fictional families of television sitcoms and the images created by mass media 's marketing geniuses . We see our television acquaintances in luxury New York apartments or Beverly Hills estates . We see advertisements on television and in magazines for everything from luxury cars to bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " In fact , through the magic of plastic , anyone can buy designer anything , at the trendiest retail shop . Or at outlet prices , " writes Schor . " That 's the new consumerism . And its siren call is hard to resist . " <p> The desire to buy escalates with what consumer researchers call the " Diderot effect , " according to Schor . It 's named after 18th-century French philosopher Denis Diderot , who wrote an essay called " Regrets on Parting With My Old Dressing Gown . " At first delighted by the gift of a new gown , he soon became dissatisfied with the rest of his possessions , which began to look shabby in comparison . Eventually , he replaced everything in his study . <p> Today , says Schor , a new house makes us want new furniture . New dishes mean new glassware . A new suit means new ties and new shirts . <p> But do Americans think they are spending lavishly ? <p> No , says Schor . " Rather , many of us feel we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . But what 's remarkable is that this feeling is not restricted to families of limited income . It 's a generalized feeling , one that exists at all levels . " <p> In a 1995 Merck Family Fund poll , more than a quarter of those in households with incomes of more than $ 100,000 a year said they ca n't afford to buy what they really need , and nearly 20 percent said they spent " nearly all their income on the basic necessities of life . " <p> " The story of the ' 80s and ' 90s is that millions of Americans ended the period having more but feeling poorer , " Schor writes . <p> Perhaps because of this anxiety , Americans are less likely than they once were to give to religious groups and other charities that might help alleviate the difficulties of the less fortunate . Over the past three decades , per-capita giving to churches among 29 major Protestant denominations declined from 3.1 percent of income to 2.6 percent , according to researchers John and Sylvia Ronsvalle of Empty Tomb Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The proportion of money given to benevolences  --  outside mission and poverty relief work as opposed to congregational operations  --  decreased from .66 percent of income to .41 percent . <p> In 1968 , 21 cents of each dollar went to benevolences , but by 1996 the amount had decreased to 16 cents , according to " The State of Church Giving Through 1996 , " a report released this month by Empty Tomb . <p> The Independent Sector , a Washington advocacy group , has noted a similar decline in overall charitable contributions . The proportion of households making charitable contributions dropped from 71.1 percent in 1987 to 68.5 percent in 1995 , the group 's research shows . And those who do give , do proportionally less : 1.6 percent of personal income in 1997 , compared with 2.1 percent in 1967 . Individuals , corporations and foundations in the United States donated $ 143.5 billion to charitable and nonprofit organizations last year , according to The Wall Street Journal . The figure might sound impressive until compared with the $ 174 billion spent on advertising in 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clothes , perfume , cars , appliances , etc . <p> There is evidence that the high rate of consumption of personal goods is taking its toll in sectors other than charity . Air pollution is increasing and landfills are overflowing . With people less willing to support public endeavors , governments are cutting back on programs from drug rehabilitation to highway maintenance . <p> " The past two decades have been a time of across-the-board retrenchment in public goods and services of all sorts , " writes " Luxury Fever " author Frank . But the tension between individual desires and the common good is not new . <p> In the introduction to her 1998 history book , " Money and Morals in America , " ( Clarkston Potter , $ 42 ) Pulitzer Prize finalist Patricia O'Toole writes , " I have been struck again and again by the extent to which individual Americans , past and present , carry within them the tension between money and morals . As a people , we want to get rich and do good , be J. P. Morgan and Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the idea that anyone who worked hard could succeed , has been a moral framework for American society , according to Princeton University sociologist Robert Wuthnow . The dream encompasses more than material success , he writes in his 1996 book , " Poor Richard 's Principal " ( Princeton University Press ) . During most of our nation 's history , it served us well : " It showed us how work and money contributed to the realization of personal , family , community and spiritual values . It reinforced the incentive structure undergirding our nation 's businesses and schools . And it defined major policy debates about economic growth , the nation 's place in the world , and the role of government in economic affairs . " <p> Over the course of the 20th century , however , Wuthnow believes , Americans ' concepts about money have become increasingly removed from important social values . <p> In the lives of individuals and families , this separation causes people to question basic commitments , he says . " How should we live ? How much should we work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals are we trying to accomplish anyway ? " <p> On a national level , rather than seeing a complementary balance between economic growth and the implementation of social programs , policy-makers seem to be caught in a " stalemate " over which to promote at the expense of the other , according to Wuthnow . <p> One reason Americans may have difficulty relating money to their personal and communal values is their reluctance to talk about it . In the United States , where sex talk is now commonplace , people are still uncomfortable with conversations about money . <p> Though money is " one of our deepest passions , in modern society it is also regarded as somehow profane , " writes Wuthnow . " Money is perhaps the topic that remains most subject to deep norms of structure and taboo . More than sex , health , death or any other aspect of personal life , it is the one most difficult for us to discuss in public .

Perhaps the best known is " the Rev. Ike , " who urged his television audience to claim worldly wealth and not to " wait for pie in the sky by-and-by . " Other television evangelists have followed in his successful footsteps . <p> With all the confusion , some people are desperately trying to climb the ladder to material success while others are voluntarily going down it . <p> So what is a good , hard-working American to do ? Especially at a time when Christmas and Hanukkah seem to be accelerating in their commercialism ? <p> Should the government tax consumption ? Should concerned individuals live on the absolute minimum and give the rest to charity , letting the greediest among us continue to accumulate more ? Can one person or one family or one church or one business make a difference ? <p> As the first step toward a change in attitude about prosperity , Americans can look down the ladder instead of up , comparing themselves to the less fortunate instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of " The Overload Syndrome " ( Navpress ) . <p> We should " see owning as a liability rather than an asset , " writes Swenson . " Everything we own requires a commitment of our work time to pay for it and our leisure time to use and care for it . " <p> " Overspent American " author Schor suggests emphasizing product durability rather than novelty , forming parents ' clubs that promote limits on spending for athletic shoes or birthday parties , agreeing with family and friends on suggested costs for gifts to be exchanged , sharing goods and services with neighbors , avoiding shopping as entertainment or therapy and developing holiday and family rituals that are less dependent on commercialization . <p> Granted , such small steps may seem to make little difference in a culture run amok in materialism .
