ENGLAND , 1108 It was n't love at first sight . Lady Brenna did n't want to be presented to company . She had far more important things to do with her day . Her nursemaid , a dour-faced woman with God-fearing ways and clumped-together , protruding front teeth , would n't listen to her arguments , however . With the determination of a hedgehog , she cornered Brenna in the back of the stables and then lunged forward . Never one to let an opportunity or a little girl slip past her , the nursemaid lectured her charge all the way up the hill and across the muddy courtyard . " Quit your squirming , Brenna . I 'm stronger than you are , and I 'm not about to let go . You 've lost your shoes again , have n't you ? And do n't dare lie to me . I can see your stockings peeking out . Why are you dragging that bridle behind you ? " Brenna lifted her shoulders in a shrug . " I forgot to put it back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and do you know why ? " " I do n't pay attention to what I 'm doing , like you tell me to , Elspeth . " " You do n't pay attention to anything I tell you , and that 's a fact . You 're more trouble than all the others put together . Your older brothers and sisters have never given me a moment 's worry . Even your baby sister knows how to behave herself , and she 's still sucking on her fingers and wetting herself . I 'm warning you , Brenna , if you do n't change your ways and give your parents a little peace , God himself will have to stop his important work and come down here to talk to you . Just how are you going to feel about that ? You do n't like it much when your papa has to sityou down on his knee and talk to you about your shameful behavior , now do you ? " " No , Elspeth . I surely do n't like it . I try to behave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the nursemaid believed she was contrite . She was n't , of course , because she really did n't think she 'd done anything wrong , but Elspeth would n't understand . " Do n't you bat those big blue eyes at me , young lady . I do n't believe you 're the least bit sincere . Lord , but you smell . What have you gotten into ? " Brenna lowered her head and kept quiet . She 'd been chasing after the piglets just an hour before , until the tanner put their mama back in the pen , and Brenna 's peculiar stench was just a small price to pay for all the fun she 'd had . Her torture had only just begun . Even though she had had a bath just a week before , she was bathed again , and in the middle of the day , of all times . She was scrubbed from head to toes , and so thoroughly she had to cry about it . Elspeth was n't at all sympathetic to her wails , and Brenna eventually got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elspeth dressed her in a blue gown and too-tight matching slippers . Her cheeks were pinched hard for color , her white-blond tangles were brushed into curls , and she was then dragged back down to the hall . She would have to pass her mother 's inspection before she could be left alone . Her oldest sister , Matilda , was already seated at the table with her mother . Cook was there too , going over supper arrangements with her mistress . " I do n't want to meet no company today , Mama . It 's sorely wearisome for me . " Elspeth came up behind her and poked her in her shoulder . " Hush now . You must n't complain . God does n't like women who complain . " " Papa complains all the time , and God likes him just fine , " Brenna announced . " That 's why Papa 's so big . Only God is bigger than he is . " " Where did you hear such nonsense ? " " Papa told me so . I want to go outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I promise . " " You 're staying right where I can keep my eye on you . You 're going to behave yourself today . If you do n't , you know what will happen to you , do n't you ? " Brenna pointed to the ground . " I 'll have to go down there . " She dutifully repeated the threat she 'd heard over and over again . The little girl did n't have any idea what was " down there " ; she only knew it was awful and she did n't want to go there . According to Elspeth , if Brenna did n't change her sorry ways , she was never going to get into heaven , and just about everyone , including her family , wanted to go there . She knew exactly where heaven was because her papa had given her exact directions . It was right on the other side of the sky . She thought she might like it , but really did n't care . Only one thing was important to her now . She was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmares at least once a week over what her mama referred to as the " unfortunate " incidents . The terrifying memories were still lurking in the back of her mind , where everyone knew all little girls tucked away their worries , just waiting for the right opportunity to jump out in the dark and scare her . Her screams would wake her sister , of course . While Elspeth was busy soothing baby Faith , Brenna would drag her blanket to her parents ' chamber . When her papa was away from home doing important work the king could give only to someone as trustworthy and loyal as he was , she 'd sneak into the big bed and cuddle up next to her mama , and when her papa was home , she 'd sleep on the cold floor right next to Courage , his beautiful silver-handled sword Mama swore he loved almost as much as his children . Brenna felt safest when her papa was there because his loud snores always lulled her back to sleep . Demons did n't try to crawl in through the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was with her parents . Those horrors would n't dare . " Please tell Brenna to keep her mouth shut when company arrives , Mother , " Matilda requested . " She shouts every word . She does it on purpose . When will she stop the vile habit ? " " Soon , dear , soon , " her mother replied almost absentmindedly . Brenna edged closer to her sister . Matilda was bossy by nature , but now that their brothers were away learning how to be as important to their king as their papa , her condition had worsened . She was becoming as bothersome as Elspeth . " You 're a pain in the arse , Mattie . " Her mother heard the remark . " Brenna , you will not use such common language again . Do you understand me ? " " Yes , Mama , but Papa says his arse is paining him all the time . It aches something fierce , it does . " Her mother closed her eyes . " Do n't sass me , child . " Brenna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mama , I 'm sorely weary of everybody telling me what to do all the time . Does n't anybody like me ? " Her mother was n't in the mood to placate her daughter . She waved her hand toward the cluster of chairs on the opposite side of the hall . " Go and sit down , Brenna . Do not say another word until you are given permission to speak . Do it now . " The little girl dragged her feet as she crossed the hall . " Do n't make her sit there all alone too long , Mother . The unfortunate incidents have made her difficult . Papa says it 's going to take her time to recover . " Mattie was defending her . Brenna was n't surprised by the show of loyalty . It was her sister 's duty to watch out for her while her brothers were away . But it made Brenna angry that Mattie had brought up the unmentionable . She knew how much Brenna hated being reminded of what had happened to her . " Yes , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mattie let out a loud sigh . " Really , Mother , how can you be so calm about it ? Have you no guilt ? Even I can understand forgetting one of your children on a single occasion , but twice ? It 's a wonder the child lets you out of her sight . " Elspeth moved forward to offer her opinion . " ' T is my fear you 'll never catch a husband for that one , mi'lady . " Brenna put her hands over her ears . She hated it when the nursemaid referred to her as " that one . " She was n't one of the piglets , after all . " I 'll catch a husband by myself , " Brenna shouted . Joan walked into the hall in time to hear her sister 's boast . " What have you done this time , Brenna ? " " Nothing . " " Then why are you sitting all by yourself ? You 're usually squeezed up next to Mother , talking her ears off . Tell me what you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I sassed Mama . Did Papa catch your husband for you , Joan ? " " Catch a husband ? " she asked . She did n't laugh for fear of hurting Brenna 's tender feelings , but she could n't stop herself from smiling . " I suppose he did , " she admitted . " Did you help ? " " No . I 'll meet my husband on the day I marry him . " " Are n't you scared he 's ugly ? " Brenna whispered . " What he looks like wo n't matter . Papa assures me it 's a strong alliance , " Joan whispered in response . " Is that good ? " " Oh , yes . Our king has given his approval . " " Rachel says you have to love your husband with your whole heart . " " That 's only a foolish wish . When she 's old enough , she 's going to marry a man named MacNare , and Rachel 's never met him . He does n't even live in England , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by promises and gifts MacNare gave him . " " Elspeth says Papa wo n't ever find anyone for me . She says Papa 's too busy for the likes of me . I have to catch one by myself . Will you help me ? " Joan smiled . " I can see this is worrying you . I 'll be happy to help . " " How do I get one ? " Joan pretended to consider the matter for a long minute before she answered . " I imagine you select the man you want and then you ask him to marry you . If he lives far away , then you must send a messenger to him . Yes , that would be how you would do it . You know , Brenna , Papa would be unhappy to hear us talking like this . It is his duty to find someone for you . Why are we whispering ? " " Mama told me not to talk . " Joan burst into laughter . The noise alerted Elspeth , who immediately rushed over . " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were told to keep quiet . Does n't that mouth of yours ever rest ? " " I 'm sorry , Elspeth . " The nursemaid snorted in disbelief . " No , you 're not sorry . " She moved closer , wagged her finger in front of Brenna 's face , and then said , " One of these days God 's going to march in here and lecture you sound , young lady . Mark my words . You 'll be sorry then . He does n't like little girls who sass . " Elspeth finally left her alone , and Brenna fell asleep waiting for company to arrive . Her sister Rachel shook her awake and pulled her along to stand with her older sisters . Brenna hid behind Rachel 's back until her name was called and she was dragged out for display . She was suddenly feeling too shy to look up at the company , and as soon as her papa finished bragging about her , she moved behind her sister again . None of the strangers paid any attention to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while everyone was ignoring her . She turned around , took one step toward the entrance , and then came to a quick stop . Three giants came through the door . She was too stunned to move . The one in the middle was taller than the other two and held her interest the longest . She watched him closely , and when her parents hurried forward to greet the newcomers , she realized he was even bigger than her own papa . She grabbed hold of Rachel 's hand and started tugging . Her sister took a long time to look down . " What is it ? " she whispered . " He is n't God , is he ? " she asked , pointing to the dark-haired guest . Rachel rolled her eyes heavenward . " No , he most certainly is n't God . " " Did Papa lie to me ? He told me only God is bigger than he is , Rachel . " " No , Papa did n't lie . He was just teasing you . That 's all . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved . Papa had n't deceived her , after all , and God had n't bothered to come down from heaven to lecture her . There was still time for her to change what Elspeth told her was her sinful life . Her papa drew her attention when he let out a bellow of laughter . She smiled because he was having such a fine time , and then she turned to look at the middle one again . She 'd been told time and again that it was rude to stare , but she did n't pay any attention to her mother 's rule now . The giant mesmerized her , and she wanted to remember everything she could about him . He must have felt her staring at him , though , because he suddenly turned and looked directly at her . Brenna decided to make her papa proud of her and behave like a proper young lady . She grabbed a fistful of her skirt , hiked it up to her knees , and then bent down to curtsy . She promptly lost her balance and almost hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to lean back so she could land on her bottom . She stood back up , remembered to let go of her skirts , and then peeked up at the stranger to see what he thought about her newly acquired skill . The giant smiled at her . As soon as he looked away , she squeezed herself up against Rachel 's backside again . " I 'm going to marry him , " she whispered . Rachel smiled . " That 's nice . " Brenna solemnly nodded . Yes , it was nice . Now all she had to do was ask . Papa let his daughters leave the hall a few minutes later . Brenna waited until everyone else had gone upstairs , then ran back outside . She was determined to catch one of the piglets today so she would finally have a pet of her very own . She would have preferred a pup , but Papa had let her older brothers and sisters have them all , and none were left for her , and she meant to right his terrible wrong by taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The piglets ' mama had once again left the pen and was now sleeping in a mud pool on the far side of the stables halfway down the hill . Brenna tried not to make any noise , but she slipped in the mud and made a loud splatter anyway . The babies must have worn their mama out . She did n't even lift her head or open her eyes . Brenna heard the loud squeak of the front doors being opened next , but when no one shouted at her , she was certain she had n't been seen . The piglets made her task easy , for they had rolled themselves into little balls and were sleeping on top of each other . Brenna scooped one into the hem of her skirts , wrapped it up tight , and then clutched it against her chest . She thought to run to the kitchens and hide her prize there , and she was sure she would have succeeded with her plan , if her new pet had n't made such a fuss about it all . Brenna did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heard a horrible noise coming toward her . Pigs were n't supposed to fly , but the enraged mama seemed to be doing just that . Her head was down , her feet were moving faster than a bolt of lightning , and her intent was clearly issued with an ear-shattering squeal that sounded like the devil himself rising out of the bowels of hell to get her . Brenna opened her mouth and let out a wail every bit as worthy as her predator 's . Too terrified to think , she ran in circles , around and around the pen , her hair flying every which way , mud splattering everywhere , clutching her piglet in her arms as she screamed over and over again for her papa to come and save her . The sight that befell her parents was horrifying . Their sweet little angel was covered with mud and running around like a hen without her head . Everyone started running at the same time . Papa did n't rescue her , for he had neither the speed nor the stride ; the giant who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nick of time . The mama 's snout tripped her , and just as Brenna was being pitched to the ground , she felt herself being lifted high into the air . She squeezed her eyes shut , remembered to stop screaming , and then looked around again . She was still in his arms , yet on the opposite side of the fence a fair distance away from the pen . She could n't imagine how he 'd been able to jump over the obstacle . Chaos surrounded them . Everyone was running toward her . Her papa was the last one to reach the fence . He was still panting when she heard him ask his company if they knew what had caused the animal to attack his dear little Faith . Brenna was n't offended . Papa was always getting their names confused . He 'd remember by nightfall though , and from the look in his eyes , she knew what would happen then . She 'd spend a good hour sitting on his knobby knees while he scolded her . She did n't even want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she had hidden in her skirts . She fervently hoped he never found out . She knew her savior could feel her pet wiggling between them , and she finally gathered enough courage to look up at him to see what he was going to do about it . He looked surprised , and when the piglet let out another squeal , he smiled . She was so happy he was n't angry , she smiled back before she could remember to be shy . One of his friends stepped closer to the fence . " Connor , is everything all right ? " He turned to answer . Brenna stopped him by putting her hand on the side of his face and nudging him back to her again . She whispered her plea then . He must not have heard her , because he leaned down closer until their foreheads were almost touching . " Do n't tell . " The giant suddenly threw his head back and roared with laughter . She told him to hush , but that only made him laugh all the more . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd put her back down , she was able to run past her papa before he could grab hold of her . " Come back here , Brenna . " She pretended she did n't hear him and continued on . It was n't until she was safely hidden under the kitchen table , with her new baby sleeping in her lap , that she realized she 'd forgotten to ask the man to marry her . She was n't discouraged . She would ask him tomorrow , and if he told her no , she would come up with another plan . One way or another , she meant to catch him and save her papa the trouble .
