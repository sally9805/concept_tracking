<p> At first blush , the recent agreement between President Clinton and the gun industry appears to offer one avenue to protect children from unsecured handguns in the home ( " Clinton , top gunmakers agree on childproofing , " news story , Oct. 10 ) . The agreement ensures that manufacturers , representing 80 percent of the handguns manufactured in the United States , will voluntarily provide trigger locks with every handgun sold . <p> While we appreciate the president 's intention , we know that we can not rely on the honor of the gun industry . After all , this agreement is voluntary , and no federal standard exists for an effective or ineffective trigger lock . <p> Much more needs to be done . Guns kill 38,000 people a year . Guns injure an additional 150,000 people . Also , guns remain the only consumer product in America not required to meet health and safety standards . With gun manufacturers producing 2 million additional unregulated handguns a year , we have a recipe for ongoing death and disaster . <p> As citizens , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionable character and motivation . We deserve laws that guarantee the compliance , accountability and commitment of the gun industry . <p> Loren Middleton , <p> board member , <p> Illinois Council Against <p> Handgun Violence , Loop <p> ' Smart gun ' pitfalls <p> Give a horse thief a brand-new rope for his hanging and he 'll still find something to complain about . So it is with your editorial ( Oct. 12 ) , " Gun locks irrelevant . " <p> For years , the use of trigger locks was touted as a " no-brainer " by gun-control advocates and the media alike . However , the recent announcement of an agreement between the Clinton administration and the gun industry to provide such devices to gun owners is being greeted with a cold shoulder by the Sun-Times . <p> From the editorial , I quote : " It makes no matter to us . " Instead , you call for " . . . the gun industry to develop so-called ' smart guns ' . . . which can be programmed to fire only by designated people . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidental deaths . " <p> While I welcome technological advances , there are several problems with " smart guns . " First of all , the practical application of this technology may be several years away . Even once perfected , we still have to contend with Murphy 's Law , which dictates that things are bound to go wrong at the worst possible moment . <p> What happens when the circuitry in the owner 's Dick Tracy style de-coder ring has a meltdown ? What happens when the batteries that supply the electronic signal from gun owner to gun go dead ? And most important , what happens when the bad guys figure out a way to jam the signal ? After all , we have technology that can jam radar and radio wave signals today . Will the criminals then use their " antiquated " 20th century guns to shoot the good guys ? <p> In reality , gadgets will never replace common sense and proper gun training . Despite the growing number of guns in our society , accidental deaths from gunshot wounds have been steadily declining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dyer , Ind . <p> By e-mail <p> Praise overflows <p> After all the criticism of the Chicago Water Department , I was more than a little leery the other day when faced with the dread task of getting several " water certifications . " <p> Thus , imagine my shock and amazement to encounter nothing but unfailing courtesy and enthusiastic cooperation from each and every employee , including supervisors . In fact , one supervisor stayed more than a half hour past the normal closing time to process my certifications . <p> Although I agree with the critics that the system could stand a good deal of reformation , the people who work for the department could n't be improved short of canonization . <p> John O'Rourke , West Lawn <p> Message to China <p> Should Illinois workers have to compete with the slave labor by political and religious prisoners of the dictatorship in China ? <p> Should decent Illinois businesses have to compete with prison businesses mostly state-run in China that use such forced labor ? <p> Should Illinois taxpayers ' hard-earned money go for purchases of goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fellow Illinois workers and human rights in China ? <p> If readers believe the answer , moral and economic , to these questions is no , there is something they can do . They can urge their state Senator to support House Bill 1176 . <p> House Bill 1176 would require vendors and contractors with the state government of Illinois to not knowingly purchase goods made by political and religious prisoners of the Chinese dictatorship . <p> House Bill 1176 , the Forced Labor Ban bill , passed the Illinois House of Representatives with strong bipartisan support , but sad to say , is now languishing in committee in the Illinois State Senate . <p> Legislation such as this has already passed in California and Massachusetts . This legislation is not anti-trade , but instead strikes a blow for fair economic competition for Illinois workers and on behalf of human rights in Chicago . <p> State Rep. Mike Boland <p> ( D-East Moline ) <p> Media witch-hunt <p> I am angry concerning your front page editorial Oct. 20 . How arrogant and how destructive ! <p> The alleged behavior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burke ( 14th ) seems to be outrageous and corrupt . However , trial and punishment by the media is far worse behavior . It 's the witch trials of Salem all over again . <p> The media should be standing up for rule by law instead of urging people to accept the media 's self-styled judgment of guilty . There seems to be an assumption by editors and other media : <p> That politicians should be subject to this trial by media . <p> Since the media have investigated and know the accusation is true , we can skip the trial and move to punishment . <p> Karen Ard , Oak Park <p> Shovel misses dirt <p> Mary A. Mitchell ( column , Oct. 23 ) brought up a very important point when she questioned why the feds and their " Operation Silver Shovel " probe basically targeted only black and Hispanic aldermen using a convicted felon as a mole , while at the same time they give only a wink and a nod to aldermen like Patrick Huels and Edward Burke , accused of ripping off taxpayers with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feds drag out some cash and then set up an entrapment scheme to nail the mostly black and Hispanic aldermen , but it took investigative reporters from the Sun-Times to uncover an alleged breach of ethics by Huels and Burke that makes all the money received by black and Hispanic aldermen pale in comparison . <p> There is n't any question that a double-standard is at work here , and the most obvious reflection of the double-standard is black and Hispanic aldermen go off to jail while white aldermen like Huels are allowed to resign , or in the case of Burke , simply chalk it up to business as usual at City Hall . <p> Bill Corcoran , Lincoln Park <p> A name that fits <p> In response to the recent scandals at City Hall , I suggest that City Hall be redesigned as a huge cash register . It should change its motto from " the city that works " to " the city that takes . " Or its motto should change to " our drawer is always open . " <p> Let 's close the drawer forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the lake <p> Kup 's column ( Oct. 31 ) quotes Hillary Rodham Clinton saying , " You know , Chicago is my kind of town . " <p> With all the recent scandals in the city government , this will come as a surprise to none . Chicagoans would not have been surprised if she had been asked to speak to the City Council on the subject of ethics in government and politics . Birds of a feather do flock together . <p> James Lenz , Near North Side
