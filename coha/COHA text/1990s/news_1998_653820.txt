<p> THAT makes a perfect country club ? It should be " a haven of refuge " dedicated to " the genuine care and comfort of our members , " said Robert H. Dedman Sr. , founder and chairman of Club Corporation International , a leading operator of country clubs and other such genteel gathering spots . <p> It should be a civilized place , he said , one that can be proudly shown to your friends , where the staff addresses you by name  --  " at least four times during each visit "  --  and always remembers your favorite cocktail . And while it should be a place where your opinions are sought and respected , " a club is not meant to be a debating society and a place of disputation . " <p> A surprising number of the company 's clubs , though , have become just that . In the last two years , at least 7 of Clubcorp 's 70 country clubs have produced lawsuits filed by either members , homeowners or , in one case , a club 's co-owner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the heart of what many members look for when they pay thousands of dollars a year to join a club : privilege and prestige . <p> These are not the clubs found in the novels of Auchincloss and O'Hara . Of the 10,000 or so country clubs in America , about half are that sort  --  nonprofit " equity clubs " owned and operated by members . Most of the rest are run for profit , usually by a management company like Clubcorp , which might lease the club property or own it outright or in partnership . <p> Several of the lawsuits contend that in Clubcorp 's case , members lose out . The company , which makes reciprocal privileges among its clubs a big selling point , lets too many outsiders use the clubs in popular resort areas , some unhappy members contend . These include members of the Indian Wells Country Club in California , familiar to armchair golfers as a regular site of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic tournament , who are seeking arbitration of the dispute . <p> Others accuse Clubcorp of breaking its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources . A few cases have involved accusations of remarkably rough-handed tactics by the company , steps that seemed intended to silence critics  --  even when those critics were club members . <p> Terry A. Taylor , senior vice president and general counsel for Clubcorp , acknowledged that the number of lawsuits against the company is higher than it has been for several years but emphasized that it is still " negligible for a company our size . " Moreover , he said , the company has already prevailed in some disputes and expects to do so in all of them . <p> In an interview at the company 's clubby Dallas offices , Robert H. Dedman Jr. , who succeeded his father as chief executive last year , grew angry at questions about the flurry of litigation . " This is a very , very minor issue , " he said . " Occasionally we may not make everybody happy . But we have built an excellent business " by pleasing members . <p> Indeed , it is Clubcorp 's reputation for treating members with kid gloves that makes all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litigation against a management company that I 've heard of , " said James Singerling , a 35-year veteran of the golf industry who is executive director of the Club Managers Association of America , in Alexandria , Va . <p> Besides country clubs , Clubcorp owns six golf resorts , including the Homestead in Hot Springs , Va. , and the Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina , where the 1999 United States Open will take place . It also owns or operates 70 city dining clubs , including the Metropolitan Club in Chicago , and 24 city athletic clubs , like the San Francisco Tennis Club . <p> In all , it says , its clubs had almost 230,000 members as of January , making it a giant in a fragmented field . Its principal rival is the American Golf Corporation of Santa Monica , Calif. , perhaps best known for its management of top-notch public courses . <p> Here in its hometown , there is considerable speculation that Clubcorp , which is now family-controlled , will soon sell shares to the public , and Mr. Dedman Sr. does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stock going to public institutions  --  which is where it will go  --  the closer we will come " to some change in the company 's status , he said . <p> But if Clubcorp is the best proof of the money to be made by marketing what the company calls the " private club experience , " the disputes show that careful attention to the fine print and a clear understanding of how clubs are governed are as important to potential members as a strong tee shot and a grasp of golfing etiquette . Limited Rights for Members <p> The Dedmans reject the suggestion that Clubcorp ignores the wishes of members  --  even though , unlike those who belong to member-owned clubs , they have only those rights Clubcorp gives them , aside from contract-law protections enforceable in court . Members of for-profit clubs , the Dedmans point out , have no obligation to finance club deficits . And since they are typically leading citizens , they have no trouble being heard , Mr. Dedman Jr . added . <p> Clubcorp 's surveys show that 87 percent of members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest , he noted , can always leave . <p> Attracting enough members to replace those who do resign has been a challenge , at least in recent years . Mirroring industry trends , Clubcorp added just 25 net new members in 1993 , when club dues lost their status as a tax deduction , and membership shrank slightly in each of the next three years , according to company financial statements . <p> In 1997 , though , membership at clubs it has owned more than 18 months grew by 3,171 , or about 1.6 percent . ( Though private , Clubcorp files financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission because it has so many employee shareholders . ) <p> Still , steadily adding clubs in the 90 's , Clubcorp has grown into a major force in golfing , with assets at the end of last year of just over $1 billion . In 1997 , it reported revenues of $840 million , up 34 percent over five years , and profits of $121.9 million , up 119 percent in that period . And it is poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it intends to use for additional acquisitions . <p> The company bears the strong stamp of Mr. Dedman Sr. , described by one industry executive as " the Henry Ford of the club management business . " His energy is legendary : in just four years after high school , according to a company biography , he earned degrees in engineering , economics and law , served two years in the Navy and worked full time for two years during law school . From humble Arkansas roots , he rose to become personal counsel to the oil billionaire H. L. Hunt . <p> In the mid ' 50s , noticing how the new Thunderbird Country Club improved property values in the area of Palm Springs , Calif. , he envisioned a company that would develop and manage clubs for profit . In 1957 , he opened Brookhaven Country Club in Dallas , with three 18-hole courses , and it became the seed of Clubcorp . Today , he is regularly included in Golf Digest 's listings of the most powerful figures in golf and is in the top third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the company , Mr. Dedman and his son , who became chief financial officer in 1987 after a three-year stint at Salomon Brothers , are known as " Robert " and " Bob "  --  the son preferred that to " Bob " and " Bobby . " Outside , both are known as tough businessmen  --  the younger Mr. Dedman 's personality is " stronger than bull meat , " said Byron Barlow , a member of Clubcorp 's Las Colinas Country Club in Irving , Tex . <p> But Mr. Barlow , among a half-dozen members whose names were supplied by Clubcorp , had nothing but praise for its performance at his club . " They have the strength of management , the continuity of management and the economies of scale to make the deal work , and member satisfaction is very high , " he said , though he added that Las Colinas voted to decline reciprocal privileges rather than open its doors to members of other Clubcorp properties . <p> Others on the list were similarly delighted . " Clubcorp made a lot of commitments up-front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of a single one they have not lived up to , " said Bob Millan , at Glen Oaks Country Club in West Des Moines , Iowa . Dispute Over a Tower <p> If all members were as happy as these , Clubcorp 's lawyers would not have been so busy lately . <p> Among those who are not happy are the clients of M. David Bland , a lawyer who represents homeowners in the Village of Raintree , a 1,600-home planned community just outside Charlotte , N.C. , who have sued Clubcorp over its operation of the Raintree Country Club . <p> " Almost every single time they told us something , it turned out not to be correct , " Mr. Bland said . Clubcorp took over the lease to operate Raintree in November 1985 . The club , its golf course and the community 's other open spaces are owned by the homeowners associations . <p> In August 1992 , the homeowners sued Clubcorp 's local affiliate , filing a complaint that accused the company of defaulting on the terms of its lease by exceeding a pre-existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lawsuit dragged on , and in July 1996 , Elizabeth Smith , president of a Raintree homeowner group , saw construction equipment rolling onto a knoll on the edge of a fairway . <p> It was there , it turned out , to build a concrete bunker the size of a two-car garage , on top of which would be a 150-foot cellular-phone tower . Furious , Ms. Smith got her camera and called her lawyer , Mr. Bland . <p> In January 1997 , when there was no response to his letter warning that homeowners considered the tower a violation of Clubcorp 's lease , the homeowners terminated the agreement , according to court records . Clubcorp resisted , and Mr. Bland obtained a court order last June evicting the company . <p> Mr. Taylor , the company 's general counsel , said there was nothing illegal or improper about the tower , which he said is simply " a flagpole , and somewhat attractive at that . " <p> The court has appointed a receiver to run the club while Clubcorp appeals , but Mr. Bland pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend itself in the original 1992 lawsuit  --  which , he said , had been rendered moot by the eviction order . <p> The long battle has left its scars on the club 's atmosphere , Ms. Smith said . " My friends tell me that it is just not as much of a warm and friendly place , " she said . <p> Raintree was not alone in complaining that Clubcorp exceeded membership limits . Discontent over golfers with reciprocal privileges using members ' supposedly private fairways is cited in almost all the recent disputes . But it is an especially sore point at Indian Wells . <p> In 1994 , Clubcorp joined with a nonprofit corporation formed by club members to buy the mountain-ringed property at auction . The members ' corporation contributed half the purchase price of about $15 million and kept title to the land ; Clubcorp acquired the clubhouse and other physical property , along with the right to operate the golf oasis as a private club . <p> But by 1997 , the number of visiting golfers led to an angry exchange of letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member-owned corporation . <p> " There is a considerable amount of unrest at Indian Wells , " wrote Richard Roemer , chairman of the members ' company . " Management has opened the golf course to outside play and tournaments during the May-through-October period to such an extent that the club is , in effect , a public facility . " <p> The manager , Doug Howe , had argued in an earlier letter that the revenue generated by visiting players was essential , because the club had not attracted enough new members . The dissident members countered that it would be easier to sell new memberships if that was the only way golfers could enjoy the club  --  and if Clubcorp had operated Indian Wells as a first-class club . <p> Fred Sardella , an outspoken member of the nonprofit corporation 's board , as well as the club 's advisory board , complained that Clubcorp " just did n't do what they said they would  --  this is not a private club , as they promised it would be . " <p> Mr. Roemer 's December letter , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members ' view it had failed to comply with its lease . <p> Mr. Dedman Sr. visited Indian Wells a few weeks ago , meeting with both the advisory board , which reports to Clubcorp management , and directors of the nonprofit corporation . The dispute , still unresolved , resulted from " miscommunication " between those groups , he said . <p> Clubcorp reports that on average , only about 1 percent of the rounds played at its clubs are by golfers exercising reciprocal privileges . <p> Clubcorp seems to have resolved a similar dispute at the handsome Canyon Gate Country Club , situated within a gated community in Las Vegas  --  but not before being sued by a half-dozen members over the number of visiting golfers . Records subpoenaed from the club showed that " often more than 20 percent of the tee times were going to unaccompanied nonmembers , " said Douglas A. Mitchell , the lawyer who represented Canyon Gate members . <p> Mr. Taylor , Clubcorp 's general counsel , said the plaintiffs represented a small group of malcontents . The suit was settled , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on outside play . So far , he said , his clients seem happy . Disputes Over Accounting <p> Some disputes Clubcorp has faced in recent years focused on allegations that it had drained away assets and maintained haphazard ledgers to obscure misuse of revenues . In one such case , Clubcorp was sued in 1996 by two members of the Errol Estates Country Club in Apopka , Fla. , after it announced plans to convert the club into a semipublic course . The case was settled when Clubcorp sold the facility to members in 1997 . <p> But the dispute was long in developing , said one member of the club 's advisory board , Grant Shrum . For years , Mr. Shrum said , excessive use and poor maintenance had caused the golf course to deteriorate seriously . " They just used up the assets of this club , " he said . <p> Mr. Taylor denied that , saying Clubcorp had simply decided Errol Estates could not survive economically as a private club and was happy to sell it to members . The lawsuit , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . <p> The members are now rebuilding the club and attracting new golfers , Mr. Shrum said . But he added that the club found itself with a financial overhang from Clubcorp 's accounting practices . <p> Errol Estates , he said , must raise nearly $2 million in the coming decades to meet its obligation to refund deposits that Clubcorp had collected from new members . Though the company had promised refunds after 30 years , it did not set aside money for that purpose . <p> Rather , according to Clubcorp 's financial disclosures , it treated such deposits at its clubs as tax-free , long-term loans , which exceeded $380 million in 1996 . James Hinckley , president of Clubcorp 's country clubs and resorts division , said the deposits were treated as income by each club , which used them to finance capital improvements or other expenses . Deposits will be refunded out of cash flow , Mr. Taylor added , and remain a liability of each club . <p> Perhaps the nastiest dispute over Clubcorp 's financial record-keeping pits it against Tohato Inc. , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club development adjacent to the Pinehurst resort in North Carolina . In 1996 , Tohato sued Clubcorp , accusing it of fraudulently enriching itself at Tohato 's expense . When two Tohato executives in Pinehurst publicly accused Clubcorp of " racketeering " and other crimes  --  and encouraged law-enforcement agencies to investigate  --  Clubcorp sued for libel . This month , it won a preliminary injunction silencing the executives . <p> While law-enforcement agents have questioned participants in some Clubcorp disputes , their agencies will not comment . Clubcorp says the inquiries were prompted solely by false statements from Tohato . Trouble for Critics <p> Despite these messy disputes , Clubcorp executives emphasize that a vast majority of members are happy , and that may well be true . But the bylaws at many of its clubs and its aggressive legal tactics make it risky for club members to be anything but happy  --  at least publicly . <p> At the Pinehurst Country Club , a private club for local residents on the grounds of the Pinehurst Resort , members had obtained a consent decree from a prior owner that gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive play by resort guests . But in 1990 , six years after Clubcorp bought the resort , it precipitated a legal battle when it sought to reinterpret the consent decree . After members prevailed at trial on many points , the company won a reversal on appeal in 1996 ; the case is awaiting reconsideration by the lower court . <p> In November 1995 , in the midst of the dispute , one club member , Edmund E. Dietrich , wrote a letter to the local newspaper , citing employee complaints that tips were not being fully disbursed to them . According to court documents , Clubcorp 's lawyers demanded a retraction . Mr. Dietrich , 72 , agreed to apologize if Clubcorp would show him records refuting the employee complaints . He returned from a holiday trip in December 1995 to find that Clubcorp had sued him for libel and slander . <p> Clubcorp withdrew the suit in October 1996 , just before Mr. Dietrich was to inspect the financial records . But Mr. Dietrich incurred more than $5,000 in legal fees and many anxious moments , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinehurst employees asked the company " to take a stand , because what he said was not true . " Local managers simply felt Mr. Dietrich " went too far , and they decided that enough was enough , " he added . <p> Criticizing Clubcorp has also produced anxious moments for some members of the Porter Valley Country Club in Northridge , Calif . A group of members there have sued Clubcorp , accusing it of exceeding the club 's membership cap and then lying to the advisory board about it . <p> Mr. Taylor said the lawsuit was based on allegations from a disgruntled former employee and was without merit . " I fear truthfully that some of those members joined that action without realizing what they were getting into , " he said . <p> But Clubcorp is making things clear . As it is entitled to do under club bylaws , it has added a pro-rated amount of its substantial legal expenses to the plaintiffs ' monthly statements of club charges . Not surprisingly , several plaintiffs have withdrawn from the suit . <p> Was all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of the complaints , Mr. Dedman Sr. said . " I 've never been aware of any of these disputes being started by highly successful people who run highly successful businesses , " he said . <p> " And I am not aware of any lawsuits we 've lost . " <p> Still , Mr. Dedman attributes his company 's success to gracious accommodation , not legal aggression . " Our No. 1 rule has always been that the members are always right , " he said with a grin . " Our No. 2 rule is , anytime a member may appear to be wrong , remember rule No. 1 . " <p> And his company 's culture drills that lesson into the hearts and minds of its local club managers through an extensive program of management training , top executives said . As Mr. Dedman Jr . put it , " We 're actually in the relationship business . " Looking Before You Putt <p> AS more people can afford to join country clubs , " you 'll find that this becomes a much more scrutinized industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Managers Association of America . <p> And careful scrutiny is a member 's best protection , said L. Louis Mrachek , a lawyer with Gunster , Yoakley , Valdes-Fauli &; Stewart of Miami , which specializes in country club litigation . <p> Prospective members should study membership documents and the club 's bylaws and articles of incorporation , or ask someone they trust to do so , Mr. Mrachek said . Only then , he said , can they fully understand their rights . And once they become members , they should monitor any bylaw amendments and act quickly if the change is unfavorable . <p> Beyond bylaws , state contract law may require that bylaw changes be " reasonable " and not alter the " basic concept or scheme " of the club , Mr. Mrachek explained . But the only way to challenge such changes may be to go to court , which can be risky if club bylaws hold dissident members responsible for the club 's legal fees , lawyers said . <p> Member-owned clubs are not immune from dissent , said Terry A. Taylor , Clubcorp 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " given the factions that usually arise in member-owned clubs , I would suspect that if the member is so inclined , he or she could have more influence on operations at one of our clubs .
