I once thought I would be younger forever . Second I was and second I would stay . For years that seemed endless , my older brother , Adrian , reminded me of my place . When the mood struck him , he struck me . <p> I was safer during my months in the womb ; I twisted , turned , floated , and kicked with alarming speed and consistency . " Alexander , " my mother would later say to me , " before you were born , you were already swimming . " <p> There is an explanation for this . As my birthday approached , threeyear-old Adrian must have sensed injustice . An alien creature , not yet fully visible , was disrupting his life . My brother 's anger and frustration , travelling like a mean-spirited sonogram , headed toward me and I swam to get away . <p> What would have happened if there had been more of us ? A few more brothers ? A sister or two ? Maybe Adrian and I would have grown up closer . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northeastern Pennsylvania , and everything around us-houses , schools , streets-had just about finished falling apart . It was as if the entire town had been constructed from the paper it had produced over the years . The paper was of high quality , but it could not shelter generation after generation . The mill would close and Morriston would fade into feathery ash . <p> We were n't poor and , like most of our neighborhood , we did not suffer growing up . The mothers and fathers of our community would be able to keep their jobs , but there would be nothing to pass on . The children would have to leave . Everyone sought their own way outsome found work in Scranton or Wilkes-Barre , some married and moved far away , a few went to college . If Adrian and I had been surrounded by other siblings , we might have united and made a group exit as a rock band or a circus act . <p> But it was just the two of us . <p> Our parents were tired from working extra hours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were too busy to remember the kind of information I desired . <p> " What was the first thing Adrian did to me ? " I occasionally asked my mother . <p> " Oh , Alex , " she 'd say . " All this will pass . " <p> Then she 'd quickly go on to tell me again that Adrian and I were brothers , as if I did n't know . " It will mean a lot to you both someday , " she insisted . <p> I thought I might find in the first strike a clear reason for my brother 's behavior . I could then change accordingly or help him to see my perspective . But there was no logic . Right before he would hit me , I 'd sometimes ask , backing away , " What ? What did I do ? " <p> When he said anything at all , he 'd say , " It 's that look on your face . " <p> So I checked various mirrors in our house , one full length , one a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door . I never noticed any upsetting , special look passing over my features , even when I stuck my tongue way out or over-puckered my lips like a fish . I could make plenty of funny faces , some a little scarier than others , but none of them cried out for hitting . Just my face . There it was . <p> It 's true , though , that I did stare right at Adrian for long moments , and maybe such silent , steady attention made him want to hurt me . I watched how he walked-duckfooted and plodding , swaying from side to side with his shoulders , trying to show toughness with each step . His hands hardly moved when he talked . I looked at his face to see how it changed when he entered a room , how his brown eyes narrowed when he listened , how the bump in the middle of his nose always seemed shiny , as if the skin had been too tightly stretched there . <p> After all , with only minor differences , my face was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved through his life , then I could figure out what made him successful in the world and me not . <p> Hitting was just one means of attack . There were also weeks , months , maybe even entire years when he 'd call me names I did n't understand . As soon as I got hold of a definition , he 'd throw a new name at me . I 'd be " xylophage " one day , then " dross-man , " then " pusillani-mouse . " <p> When I turned twelve , I suddenly needed glasses for my eyes and tiny tubes for my ears . While I tried to cope with these changes , Adrian found a name for me to keep . " Martian , " he called me . <p> " You 're an alien , " he went on . " You have physical problems because your body 's struggling to adjust to the earth 's atmosphere . " <p> " You 're the Martian , " I told him . <p> " Who 's wearing glasses ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're the Martian , " I repeated . <p> " No . I was born here and I 'm thriving . You were hatched on a distant planet and dumped like trash into outer space . " <p> Eventually , I stopped resisting , even though my first real memory of Adrian suggests he 's as responsible as anyone for the main alien features he identified . In this memory , I 'm three and he 's six . He 's lifting me up and I am happy . This is the way older brothers should behave-raise up the younger ones , help them to reach what they ca n't grasp themselves . There 's something he wants me to do . We lean against the kitchen counter and he 's holding me up with my back to his chest , his arms wrapped beneath my rib cage . He tells me to pick up the fork and stick it into the holes on the wall by the toaster . <p> I do n't remember feeling the shock , but I do remember the fork 's melted , blackened tines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolt of electricity shooting through my young skull , damaging the tissue of my eyes and ears . <p> By the time I turned thirteen , I had read enough books and seen enough TV to realize that outer space aliens possessed a power all their own . There were definite advantages to being an energetic Martian at my understaffed junior high school . In the middle of class , I would start waving my arms like a drowning child , shouting that I could not breathe this earthly air . " I ca n't see , " I sometimes exclaimed . " My world has gone dark ! " And when a teacher or a scared student would say , " Alex , calm down . Please calm down , Alex , " I would shout louder . " Oh no , now I ca n't hear ! What did you say ? I ca n't even hear a word I 'm saying ! What did I just say ? Can you hear me ? " <p> Teachers told me to visit the nurse , but I 'd head outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would often find fellow cutters . We 'd smoke some cigarettes or walk a few blocks to buy snack food . We were not a particularly bad bunch ; we just wanted our days to go differently . <p> When I turned fourteen and began high school , I was actually glad to learn that I would need braces-I 'd have a new routine for my new teachers . During the second week of ninth grade , a few days after the orthodontist had glued and twisted a handful of metal into place around my misdirected Martian teeth , I sat for about three minutes in algebra class before I started moaning and fingerpointing . I tried to communicate that my tongue had become stuck in my braces . Did my aging , over-worked teacher fully understand or care what I was saying ? It 's hard to determine . At some point , it must have been easier for everyone just to let me leave . <p> New to the high school , I did n't know which direction to go once I left class , so I wandered through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know exactly where Denny DeLue came from that morning . Coach of the swim team and assistant director of physical education , DeLue stood maybe two inches above five feet . He was a powerful man , with shoulders so broad that his red-haired head and freckled face appeared strangely small . He resembled a Martian far more than I did . " De-Loser , " Adrian and his friends called him , from a distance . <p> His job seemed to give him immense satisfaction , and he made the gym a safe place , but , at the same time , he liked pushing everyone to their limits . During gymnastics , for instance , if you lost your balance , he 'd keep you from banging your head against the beam ; he 'd catch you if you lost your grip on the rings . But first he would let you reach the point where you knew you were falling . Panic charged through your whole body . Fear filled your thoughts . Then he would save you , stand you gently up on your own two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've got you , " I once heard him say . Or , " There you go . No problem . Safe and sound . " It was just enough to guarantee you 'd never look at him the same way again . <p> When he appeared from nowhere and surprised me in the empty hallway , he spoke as if he had been waiting for me all morning . " Alexander , " he said . " Been looking for you . Come with me . " <p> It took a second , but I recovered my presence of mind enough to say , motioning wildly in the general direction of my mouth , " Nung nuck nin naces . Ny need nurse . " <p> " Let me see , " DeLue said . He pulled down on my chin with his right hand and if my tongue had really been attached to my braces , it would have ripped in two . <p> " You 're fine , " he said . " Come with me . " <p> " Maybe I should get back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left class , " he said . " Let 's go . " <p> " Where ? " I wanted to know . <p> " Swim test . " <p> All through my time in public school , my teachers seemed to be Adrian 's accomplices . He 'd hit me , call me names , and then I 'd go into class , glad to be out of the house , only to hear how smart and bright and witty my brother was and how I was not the same . " Adrian 's not my brother , " I would sometimes shout . " I 'm a Martian and I 'm not related to him at all . " <p> Those words expressed my frustration , but they did not make me feel better . What felt better was swimming one length of the pool and hearing DeLue say , " Good , good . You 've got a stroke we can use . Not like your brother Adrian . " <p> " What ? " I asked , just to hear it again . <p> " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fool in the pool . " <p> I liked the way that sentence echoed off the tiled floors and walls . I immediately nodded Yes when DeLue said , " Practice here at threethirty , starting today . All right ? " <p> Even after I changed and left the gym , I did not regret my decision . What did I have to do after school anyhow ? Rush home and try to dodge Adrian ? Hang out with some back-of-the-bus kids behind the school ? Sure , I 'd swim . <p> After a few practices , I decided that DeLue 's own appearance must have led him to assemble a team full of outcasts and odd-balls . There were only a few boys with traditional v-shaped bodies and they had been swimming for years . Most of the recruits came from DeLue 's walks through the hallways and parking lots . Some cut class , others wrote cryptic notes to themselves , and one played the tuba . We had long thin legs or pudgy little hands or too-large stomachs and , early in the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so strange with my thick plastic glasses and my bald scalp that my parents rushed me out to get contact lenses . <p> I preferred wearing the glasses . <p> From the first , DeLue saw me as a distance man . Plenty of people could handle the sprints and relays . " What this team needs right now , " he said , " is someone who can go on and on . " During practice he would set me off in my own lane , telling me to do one kilometer after another . " Efficiency , " he 'd say , " that 's what we 're after . " And he 'd tell me to swim straighter , to focus on hitting my turns . " No wasted motion , " he 'd say . " Wasted motion slows you down and tires you out . " <p> Practices could get crazy because he 'd lead us up to the balcony , where there were six rows of bleachers for spectators , and he 'd make us run . We had to hop up the steps two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up again , up and down , from one end of the balcony to the other . Our bare feet slapped against the tile floor and DeLue clapped his hands to set the pace . He shouted questions and answers while we huffed along . " When are you fastest in the pool ? When you dive in at the start . You 're slowing down after that . You need to dive out with your legs ! When are you second fastest in the pool ? Each time you turn . You accelerate toward the wall , you hit your turn , and you need your legs to push you out into the lead ! " <p> During these bleacher drills there would always be one or two moments when I would find myself on the top stair , waiting for the person in front of me to run ahead . I 'd look out over the team , everyone moving quickly through the chlorine-filled air . We were a bunch of barefoot , skinhead , shaved-legs guys , wearing dark blue Speedo suits . We had goggle indentations around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bulky man with a shock of red hair . I wondered what someone walking in off the street would think of us . <p> And if Adrian and my parents were to step in , would they be surprised to see me amidst such a group ? Once they picked me out , poised so high above them , would they be puzzled or proud or both ? <p> If anyone did watch , no matter who they were , they 'd eventually see us return to the water for freestyle sprints . DeLue would walk from lane to lane , shouting at us . He 'd keep telling us how and when to breathe , as if it were something we had never done before . <p> DeLue did n't require practice twice a day , but he scheduled optional early morning swims , and he was there at 5:30 a.m. , Monday through Friday , ready to help . Nearly everyone came in . DeLue would offer advice , but there was none of the calling out that filled the afternoon sessions . He kept everything quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together at a nearby market , and head to class . <p> Once I was in the routine of swimming before and after school , nothing felt more natural . All through the day , I could smell the chlorine that tightened my skin , and the sharp odor only made me look forward more to afternoon practice . I felt the soreness of my muscles as I walked down the hallways or lifted books out of my locker , but I knew I would be lighter and looser in the pool . When my stroke was on , I could soar , smooth along the surface , making the water rush past me . <p> Meanwhile , Adrian began to disappear from my life . As a high school senior , he had his college future to arrange . I swam and hardly saw him at all . He busied himself with pamphlets , recommendation forms , and application after application . <p> Even though the team never came close to winning , my parents attended as many meets as they could and they tried to get Adrian to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do n't want to see him bald and in a Speedo . " <p> I was n't sure exactly how it would happen , but I kept believing Adrian and I would become close . We 'd learn , over time , to laugh at our growing up . " I do n't know what I was thinking , " Adrian would say to me , one of his arms draped around my shoulders . " I do n't know what my problem was . " I 'd tell him I understood even if I did not . <p> Then his graduation came and went , and we grew no closer . He was going to move to Maine , where a small college had awarded him a scholarship . " All this will pass , " our mother had said , but her words seemed true in ways she did n't mean . <p> That summer I life-guarded at the YMCA to make a little money , but mainly I worked to become stronger and better-looking . I swam often , of course . I also ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I 'd put together my own personal triathlon and I 'd surprise everybody with the number of miles I could go . <p> I liked covering so much distance . Back roads stretched from Morriston west to Scranton , and you could ascend for miles , then ride along a ridge and gaze out over the paper-making valley . From far away , the industrial seemed scenic . The sense of decay , so obvious from our front door , disappeared , and I saw instead a gentle oasis protected by rolling hills . It did n't look like the kind of town anyone would ever want to leave . <p> But Adrian did not hesitate . On the day he was to drive north , I woke up early and took a long bike ride . When I returned , he was almost set to go . He stood beside his rusty , green Jeep and he checked to make sure everything he possessed was carefully packed . He looked light on his feet , as if he were already just visiting . <p> " Here 's Alex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " <p> When my father hugged him and my mother hugged and kissed him , Adrian stared off over their shoulders , toward a point somewhere above the roof of our squat house . He patted their backs while they wrapped their arms around him . When he stopped in front of me , he extended his hand . It was offered and empty , not balled into a fist , and I wondered , How is it that , in all of these years , I have never hit him ? I had become strong enough and there were certainly times when I could have made him feel directly some of the frustration and anger I had stored up for so long . I knew then , standing before him , that I never hit him because I feared it would separate us further . I never hit back because I feared he would leave and here he was , leaving . <p> If I had been older or different , I might have brushed his hand aside , wrestled him to the ground , and forced him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I could have shouted into his startled face . " It would n't hurt you to be nicer . " Instead , I tried to convince myself that I did n't need him . If he wanted to shake hands , then I could shake hands . <p> During the years that followed , Adrian appeared in a persistent disaster dream of mine . I 'd fall asleep and then we 'd be sitting together in a simple wooden rowboat out on the ocean . Adrian had the oars , but only for an instant because the dream carried us into the center of a raging storm , complete with monsoon rain , enormous waves , hurricane winds . The boat vanished and it became impossible to distinguish the dark rough sea from the dark drenched sky . For me , the distance man , it was only water , and I stayed afloat . Lifted to the top of wave after wave , I saw the shore , not too far away . I knew immediately that Adrian would n't be able to make it on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was by his side , I waited until the last second . I watched my older brother go under , his arms flailing , his wide eyes looking to me for help . Up he bobbed again , his head breaking through the surface of the water , and he breathed in as much air as he could . I heard him gasping . I watched him sink down once more as I floated with ease . I felt more than strong enough to grab hold of my brother and pull him out of danger . It would n't be difficult at all . As he came up again , he reached his open hand out to me , and I reached for him , speaking to him , shouting so he could hear , " I 've got you , Adrian ! Do n't worry ! " <p> I did have him . For a moment , I held on , my arm wrapping around his chest . Then , just before I woke up , I looked and saw the rough water covering his head . <p> I swam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was through swimming that I found my career . " Hey Alexander , " DeLue asked me one day , " what are you going to do with yourself after you graduate ? " <p> " I have no idea . " <p> " Have you thought about diving ? " <p> " I 'm a distance man , coach . I do n't dive . " <p> " Not that kind of diving . I mean diving as in deep sea diving , as in marine biology . " <p> Community college followed , then a masters program at Penn State , and then a job with the United States Department of Fisheries that sent me to North Carolina . Now , nearly two decades after high school , I tell people what I do , and I can watch the wrong impression wash over their faces . Saying I 'm a marine biologist is like announcing that I 'm an astronaut or , better , an alien , for it 's my access to a completely other world that tends to interest everyone . So they can understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dispel their illusions immediately . <p> " I work for the government , " I say , " not for Jacques Cousteau , may he rest in peace . " <p> I perform simple damage assessment and my dives are not complex . Based in Beaufort , I check the population of sea grasses in the shallow , well-travelled waters around the Outer Banks . I monitor the destructive effects of pollution and wayward ships . I have friends who do more glamorous work and their studies of dolphins , sharks , and herons attract considerable attention and funding for our lab . My research , in comparison , is extremely low profile . I putter just offshore in a small motorized rowboat . I zip on a wet suit , drop myself overboard , and sink down to the bottom . I stay there counting roots and shoots until my air runs out . It may not sound particularly thrilling , but I love my work-I do good , solid science . <p> In my own way , I have been successful . As has Adrian . He cruised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved on to an MBA , married , and bought a house just outside of Boston . They had a daughter named Anna , and then , two years later , a second child , a son named Turner . <p> I have no wife , no children , and , lately , no hair . Once a Martian , always a Martian , or so it sometimes seems to me . Adrian works with people , I work under water . He makes a great deal of money , I do not . <p> Our parents were proud of us both to the end . Whenever they saw us , they said how pleased they were with our progress . One at a time , they passed away . " Take care of each other , " they said as they departed , and we smiled at them before returning to our separate lives . <p> I continued imagining conversations Adrian and I would have . We 'd have so much to say , so many plans to make for a different future . But my nightmare was more accurate-I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , I called to talk , but there was never a good time for me to go to Boston , and , more often than not , it was Julia who answered the phone to tell me in her happy voice that Adrian was busy . " I do n't understand why the two of you do n't get along , " she occasionally said . <p> I am certain she is the one who made Turner 's visit possible . Maybe the gifts I sent north to Boston helped-a snorkel and mask , flippers , a small aquarium-or maybe he watched certain TV shows , or maybe it was just a natural consequence of his being the younger child . For whatever reason , at age twelve , Turner began to tell people he wanted to be a marine biologist . So , one night , out of the blue , Julia called and arranged for him to travel south for a few days between Christmas and the new year . <p> He arrived late in the evening , ready for sleep , but he was clearly excited when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and take a motor boat out on the water . We had never spent much time together , and I had not seen him at all in four years . I led him to the car , thinking how strange it was to have him walking by my side across the well-lit New Bern airport parking lot . Adrian 's son , a bounce to his step , a backpack over his shoulder-he was a little man looking up into my eyes . " Uncle Alex , " he said , and a moment passed before I realized he was speaking to me . <p> " Nephew Turner , " I replied , taking his backpack into my hand . <p> " Will we go fishing tomorrow on the boat ? " <p> " No . We 'll do something better . " <p> " Diving ? " <p> " Better . " <p> After he fell asleep on my futon-couch , I called Boston . Julia answered and I told her Turner had arrived safe and sound . <p> " Is n't he cute ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So grown up . He walks like a little man . " <p> " Adrian says he looks just like you used to look . " <p> I paused . " Does he smile when he says that ? " <p> " Not really , " she said . <p> I awoke too early , could n't get back to sleep , and so I let my mind fill with questions . They were questions for Turner , and I resisted the temptation to wake him up . What have you heard about me ? I wanted to ask . What is it like around your house from day to day ? How does your older sister treat you ? How do you get along with your father ? <p> As the first light began to shimmer on the water , I walked quietly through the living room and into the kitchen to make coffee . I watched Turner sleeping . I noticed his out-sized feet and hands , his blond hair , the fair face of his mother , the broad shoulders of his grandfather , and I imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , there on the futon , he looked small to me , and new . Despite what Julia had said on the phone , Turner reminded me most of my brother-a much younger version , on the edge of growing and changing . When I reached out to touch his shoulder , I could feel myself holding my breath . I could almost hear the peaceful , resting rhythm of his heart , and I was telling myself : Do n't talk too much . Do n't talk too much . Do n't scare him away . <p> Because one of my friends had left town for the holidays , I had been able to make special arrangements for Turner-he 'd get a taste of the more glamorous side of marine biology . Twice a week , my friend had to monitor the dolphin population at several specific sites around Cape Lookout and I had agreed to fill in for him while he was away . As we left the apartment , I told Turner we would spend the day counting dolphins . He rushed outside . <p> Beaufort seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we stepped into the twenty-one-foot boat . The forecast called for calm weather , little wind , and I was happy to see smooth water stretching out before us . Turner was smiling , looking everywhere . If there had been a crow 's nest , he would have climbed right up to it , binoculars in hand , to see all he could see . <p> We started out and , for a while , there were only gulls . I liked the anticipation that filled Turner as he kept watch . We closed in on Cape Lookout and I showed him the lighthouse , a landmark that would be in sight throughout the day . Then I showed him the first spot where we 'd be stopping , marked by a buoy , but also marked by movement in the water . I cut the motor as we drew up . <p> The dolphins were right there , swimming around us , arcing out of the water , slipping over one another . They appeared so playful and powerful , churning through the surf , splashing , diving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stern . " There 's another ! " he shouted . " And another ! That 's five ! No , nine ! Twelve ! Seventeen ! " <p> His voice did n't disturb the dolphins . In fact , I dropped a microphone into the water , switched on the speaker , and we could hear them squeaking and chirping to each other . Turner stood still and listened . " Awesome ! " he said , and then he was off again , moving all over the boat . <p> I should have been focussing more carefully on the count , but we had plenty of time , and I was paying attention to other things . I was trying to remember the details of Turner 's happiness-the sound of his voice , how he kept standing on his tiptoes , the way he waved his hands above his head , as if he were sending signals of joy to approaching ships . <p> I stepped behind Turner and I lifted him up . He was not too heavy . I had my balance and , with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a sacrifice . He probably thought I was just helping him to get a better view of the beauty surrounding us . He laughed and pointed out toward the horizon . He did n't know I was tempted to drop him overboard , into the deep , cold water . <p> What would happen if I let him fall ? Would he panic ? Could he climb up into the boat on his own ? Would I dive in after him ? I could wait and wait before making the rescue . Everything might slip beyond my control at the end . <p> Alongside us , two dolphins arced into the air , splashed down , and slapped the water with their tails , kicking up sea spray that hit my face while I thought of all I could destroy and how quickly . <p> I set Turner back down on the deck and he was still laughing . " I 'm going to start over , " he told me . Then he began counting once more . <p> I stood at the helm , gripped the steering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands relaxed , I wrote the numbers in the log and prepared to move on . Before I started the engine , I called to my nephew . " Grab hold ! " I shouted . <p> I wanted Turner safe , I wanted him to have a wonderful time , and more than anything I wanted him to come back again and again . If I could , I would be an older brother to him . He would be a younger brother to me . And I hoped he would never be haunted by the desire to do his brother harm . <p> Author Affiliation
