<p> Far from the din over which parade should officially honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , far even from the soaring sleekness of downtown that from this Third Ward corner looks so near , Madgelean Bush for 28 years has lived the legacy of the slain civil rights leader . <p> Here , where the Martin Luther King Jr . Community Center holds fast as one of the last tangible remnants of the War on Poverty , where the surrounding neighborhood speaks of a need almost impenetrable , Bush has not only endured , but in a very measurable way , flourished . <p> " " We had already decided to name the center something else on the night 28 years ago this April 4 that we heard Dr. King had been assassinated . Since we also had decided to adopt the bootstrap philosophy of Dr. King , well , it was a unanimous decision to rename the center , " Bush remembers , as the center prepares to celebrate King 's birthday on Monday . <p> " " I guess for everything there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for keeping this center open for all these years . <p> Something bigger than all of us involved at the King Center is keeping it open . <p> " " And I 'll tell anybody , there 's been some good times , some bad times and some tough , tough , tough times that we 've been through . But this year , I can honestly say as I look back , it 's been worth it . " <p> This year , if all goes as Bush hopes , the well-worn playground will gleam with new equipment , courtesy of Shell Oil . Work will begin on a new , 16-unit facility for the homeless of the community . And to the day care , tutorial classes , athletic programs , elderly care , emergency shelter , food pantry and feeding programs will be added a peer mediation program for 60 additional children from the Houston Independent School District . <p> " " Believe it or not , " says Bush , gazing out her second-floor office window at the desolate community around her , " " the needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . <p> " " There was much more of a community support system out here back then . But so many have died in the last 28 years . So many others have left the neighborhood . And persons do n't volunteer like they used to because they 're unemployed or have fragmented families . <p> " " Drugs have taken over . Houses have been torn down so we have a lot of homeless people out here . And the welfare system has not helped as much as it should have . I call it a revolving welfare system . On six months . Off six months , " Bush 's voice trails off , pondering the enormity of the problem . When she finally speaks , it is of the children who are the heartbeat of the center . <p> " " There are just so many things that we need out here that we do n't have . But in the end , I think the biggest need is parenting . We have so many grandparents now taking care of grandchildren . Ca n't find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , they 're in no condition to work and be supportive for their children . <p> " " And I keep saying , this has got to get better . And I do n't know . " <p> Former Metropolitan Transit Authority Chairman Anthony Hall , who along with Craig Washington , Rodney Ellis and the late Mickey Leland are fondly referred to by Bush as her " " children , " says hands-on leaders like Bush today are rare . <p> " " Madge Bush represents in the clearest way the history of the struggle for community self-help and self-determination since the advent of the most recent civil rights era , " says Hall , who also is a former city councilman and state representative . <p> " " At a time when there were not community-controlled social service agencies and programs , she helped to invent them . And she is one of the few who has persevered through the changes both in the civil rights struggle and in society itself to address needs that have not changed . " <p> Hall concedes Bush and the center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probation by the state agency that licenses emergency shelters , has her controversial edges . <p> " " But the nature of her work would make her controversial , probably because she has not agreed to have her programs and her dreams for the people who benefit from them die , " says Hall . <p> Bush , who in the style of folks over 60 who long ago stopped mincing words , is blunt about her travails with those who monitor such community agencies . <p> " " We were crucified out here in 1994 . We were put on corrective action . We were put on probation . Oh , some horrible political things happened to us . And when I tried to talk to my representatives , they were not sympathetic , so I talked to former Governor Ann Richards , who talked to my representatives And you know what they told her ? " Bush recalls , still indignant at the memory . <p> " " Oh do n't worry about Madge . Madge complains about everything . <p> And I 'm saying , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I was n't controversial , I would n't be here . <p> " " But as William Simon , one of the founders of this center who is now deceased always used to say , ' Bush , let them run you over , around and through , but not off . Do n't ever let them run you off . ' " <p> Last year , the center had an $ 800,000 budget from state and federal funding for a panoply of programs that service every age group in the community . This year , largely because of the new facility for the homeless , the budget will run more than $ 2 million . But still , Bush says as she again looks out the window , sometimes it seems the center has scarcely made a dent . <p> " " We have buried the dead . We have helped people get glasses . <p> We have a health clinic here every month with the city of Houston . We do feeding , at the center , in homes out here and , once a month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " " And if you 're wondering how we do so much with so little , all I can say is that we 've done it for so long that it comes natural . " For the past several years , Veon McReynolds , assistant professor at Texas Southern University , and students from the psychology department " " Hands Across the ' Hood " program , have linked arms with the center to provide badly needed food for the hungry in the community . <p> Most recently , the TSU volunteers delivered a truckload of fruits and vegetables to add to the Christmas turkeys and canned goods that the center doled out by the hundreds . And this year , a community garden project will yield fresh greens and other produce on a more regular basis . <p> Like Hall , McReynolds believes grassroots leaders like Bush personify the King philosophy of peaceful change . <p> " " Dr. King was about trying to give something of yourself back to the community for the whole struggle of liberation . And if people want to keep his spirit alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something . Because if they do n't , the spirit dies , " says McReynolds . <p> " " Mrs. Bush is the last of a dying breed . When I think of Mrs. Bush , it makes me sad because there really are n't a lot of people who will sacrifice their lives to deliver services to the poor the way she has done . There 're not a lot of people who I come across , who are young , who want to do that . They want to make $ 40,000 anyway they can . " McReynolds says Bush and people like her give him hope . And watching Bush as she calmly walks through the children in the day-care rooms and emergency shelter , feeling a forehead here , admiring a barrette there , and greeting even the tykes by name , it is clear what McReynolds and Hall both mean . <p> Bush is a rock , resolute and unyielding . But with the political climate toward social service agencies chilled , and the career lifespan of directors increasingly short , even rocks sometimes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of despair , " admits Bush . " " But I have a conscience , and that 's something most people have lost . <p> And when I think of the amount of people who depend on this agency , I ca n't be selfish and just look at myself and my needs " . <p> " " Caring and sharing have been the backbone of my life . So I just take one day at a time . Now taking one day at a time and rolling with the punches , it ai n't easy , because every time you put out one fire , two more are lit . <p> " " But I do n't panic easy , and thank God for that . "
