BOOKS : Thumbs down " By the Light of My Father 's Smile " by Alice Walker ( right ) . Walker 's talent is undeniable and her activism well-intentioned , but her relentless New Age sermonizing is making her fiction impossible to get through .

Carlos Museum at Emory University : Well-curated and heartening evidence that Atlanta does harbor serious collectors . " Shamans , Gods and Mythic Beasts : Colombian Gold and Ceramics in Antiquity " : No expertise needed to admire the sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metalwork of ancient Colombia . Toulouse-Lautrec at the High Museum : The king of the poster and the fine-art print got his due in this fine exhibition from a private Atlanta collection . Walker Evans at the High Museum . An illuminating survey , also from an Atlanta collection , that revealed interests and subtlety beyond the WPA photos for which this photographer is most famous . East Lake community : A bold and creative move to use golf as an engine for neighborhood revitalization . Duane Hanson at Oglethorpe University Museum : Displays of the late artist 's tools and materials contributed greatly to understanding the art behind these realer-than-real sculptures . VISUAL ARTS : Thumbs up and thumbs down The High Museum 's Pop Art exhibition offers a good look-back at a still timely art movement . The monumental " F-111 , " rarely seen in totality , is a wonder . Too many Atlantans are missing this opportunity . VISUAL ARTS : Thumbs down Demise of the Arts Festival of Atlanta : A great loss , both as one of metro Atlanta 's few community-building events and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallery . Overhyped paintings by a " prodigy " devalue the real thing . Barbara Asher memorial sculpture on Marietta Street . An honor ruined by artlessness . In this bronze portrait , the respected late councilwoman has a face like one of the seven dwarves and poses for eternity like an amateur songstress in a high school play . Maybe Atlanta should give up on public art until it can choose better . Gaylen Gerber at the High . Many viewers probably missed this installation altogether  --  a row of trees set against a white wall . Just as well . Work so abstruse as to require a wall text just to find , let alone understand , gives naysayers an opportunity to make fun of contemporary art .  --  Catherine Fox , visual arts critic THEATER : Thumbs up " Measure for Measure , " Georgia Shakespeare Festival . It took director Tim Ocel and the well-seasoned Shakesfest  --  led by actors John Ammerman , Jan Akers and Tim McDonough  --  to bring Shakespeare 's notoriously tricky " problem play " to blazing life , holding up a mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Blood Knot , " Theatrical Outfit . Atlanta theater 's version of the Dream Team  --  playwright Athol Fugard , producer-star Tom Key , guest star Kenny Leon  --  reaffirmed the ancient power of theater in its purest form . Two actors . A near-empty stage . Burnished words , creating a world in small . The Frank Manley Festival , Theater Emory and PushPush Theater . The astonishing range of the dean of Atlanta playwrights was showcased in premieres masterminded by Emory artistic director Vincent Murphy . " Learning to Dance " was yet another triumph for McDonough and Akers as mature Catholics in forbidden love ; " Cockfighter , " a raw dispatch from the Southern subconscious . " Medea , " the Alliance Theatre . As they proved in 1996 's " Blues for an Alabama Sky , " Phylicia Rashad and director Leon are among the most potent combinations on the national scene , especially when backed up by the Alliance 's superb designers . " Kwaidan , " the Center for Puppetry Arts . Ping Chong 's adaptations of Japanese ghost stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwordly beauty from the underworld . Center artists were full-fledged collaborators with the New York visionary . THEATER : Thumbs up and thumbs down " Elaborate Lives : The Legend of Aida . " Disney came , Atlanta saw , Disney conquered , selling a record 47,000 tickets for co-producer Alliance . Sure , the Elton John/Tim Rice songs were catchy . But the faux-Egyptian extravaganza was n't up to Alliance standards for emotional truth , and no wonder : It was actually a booked-in show . THEATER : Thumbs down " The Rocky Horror Show , " the Roxy . The title said it all for this Memphis-based tour . Rocky . Horror . " The Quality of Mercy , " Alliance . It 's hard to say who was more deluded : New York critics for admiring the script or director John Dillon for thinking the jobbed-in actors would ring true . " Kiss of the Spider Woman , " Jomandi Productions . With some of the nation 's strongest African-American talent to choose from , how does one botch the casting of a two-man show ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's story and a stellar cast , what could go wrong ? Plenty . More proof ( as in 1997 's " To Kill a Mockingbird " ) that famous Southern writers can be miserably served by their chosen adaptors .  --  Dan Hulbert , theater critic POP MUSIC : Thumbs up Revivals : " Our age is retrospective , " Emerson once wrote . He should 've been in the music business . The most exciting recordings of 1998 were made 30 , 40 , 50 or 60 years ago : Bob Dylan 's " Live : 1966 , The Royal Albert Hall Concert " ; Dock Boggs , the coal-mining banjo player who inspired Dylan , " Country Blues : Complete Early Recordings ( 1927-29 ) " and " Dock Boggs : His Folkways Years 1963-1968 " ; and neglected rockabilly great Charlie Feathers ' " Get With It .

Homegrown : Local singer-songwriter Shawn Mullins ( left ) was the year 's Cinderella story , scoring a six-figure deal with Columbia and critics ' accolades for his ninth album , " Soul 's Core . " Other Atlanta artists did strong work as well , across a broad range of genres . OutKast , UltraBabyfat , Cat Power , Rock*a*Teens and Goodie Mob , among others , emphasized the growth of a city where a few years ago there was no identifiable " sound " at all . R.E.M. : When drummer Bill Berry opted out of rock ' n ' roll for life on his farm , the Athens supergroup could have folded . Instead , it made the risky " Up , " a flawed but often richly beautiful song cycle . Downtown venues : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demolished , the Arts Festival of Atlanta is history , Underground Atlanta 's in trouble and yet . . . downtown is rocking . The Tabernacle , a newly anointed hot spot in its post-House of Blues incarnation , was the missing link in the city 's concert hall formula . See also : the Rialto Center for the Performing Arts . Atlanta 's jazz scene : Better than it used to be . And events like the National Black Arts Festival 's international jazz summit ; concerts by David S. Ware , Steve Lacy , Jemeel Moondoc , Butch Morris , Nicholas Payton , Tommy Flanagan , Gerry Hemingway , Herbie Hancock , the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra ; concert series at the Rialto and Spivey Hall ; and improv evenings at Dottie 's and the Silver Ceiling meant there was always something to look forward to . " Wide Open Spaces , " the Dixie Chicks : They look like dime-store versions of Madonna , but the Chicks had Nashville clucking this year with this platinum CD delivering a wide load of down-home , fiddle-based country . " High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-handedly resurrected the low , phone-sex growl of the late Conway Twitty with his unexpected hot-hot-hot single " I 'll Go on Loving You . " Country rap at its best . " I 'm Alright , " Jo Dee Messina : With her big red hair and tight black leathers , Messina looks like something out of " Tarzan and the Leopard Women . " But her voice is as powerful as her looks . She 's proven she 's a master of the hit single , with tunes like " Bye Bye . " " Crown of Jewels , " Randy Scruggs : Nashville 's most talented picker returns to his family roots ( he 's the son of bluegrass legend Earl Scruggs ) on an album packed with some of the best musical/vocal collaborations ( Trisha Yearwood , Emmylou Harris and Iris Dement ) of the year . " Aquemini , " Outkast : Atlanta 's dynamic rap duo came up with this genre 's album of the year by applying as much thought to its danceable political statements as to its partying . " R. , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit much , but song after song Kelly proved that he can pen rhythm-and-blues like none of his peers . " Hymns , " Corey Glover : The voice in Living Colour that revealed rocks ' R &B; roots returned and affirmed that R &B; can rock . " Connected , " Family Stand : The kind of funk , improvisation and soul that Prince , Sly Stone and Stevie Wonder used to provide . POP MUSIC : Thumbs down Courtney Love : Dig those prefab , air-brushed guitar hooks , but " Celebrity Skin , " Love and her band Hole 's attempt to gate-crash the modern-rock marketplace , was a lame shot at selling out . Marilyn Manson : Sure , you loved the video . Everybody loved the video . But why do you think they call it " The Dope Show " ? Puff Daddy as Will and Idea : Can we pull the plug on the karaoke machine ? White Rockers Who Insist on Rapping and Are Not the Beastie Boys : It may only be a truism that white people have no culture , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all ska/punk/metal acts hailing from Southern California who mistakenly throw down with the Hip-Hop Nation . Swing : Boy , that Brian Setzer sure knows how to surf a trend . Further proof that rock is dead . " Come on Over , " Shania Twain : Has anybody noticed that the single " Honey , I 'm Home " is a near-exact remake of Def Leppard 's " Pour Some Sugar on Me " ? Guess not . The second CD from the Canadian went double platinum . Jewel : OK , maybe those white rappers are n't so bad , after all . " Double Live , " Garth Brooks : Much too young to feel this damn gold . Brooks ' shtick is wearing thin as his bank account grows . The pre-superstardom tunes are alive , but the rest is just the sound of the cash register ringing .
