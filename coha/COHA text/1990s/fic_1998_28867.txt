Texas , 1892 " I do n't give a damn if you are part owner of that ranch , you 're not going to run it ! " " That 's not fair and you know it ! You 'd let Tyler run it if he was here . " " Tyler 's a full-grown man now . You 're just seventeen , Casey . " " I do n't believe you said that . He 's full-grown at one year older'n me , when women my age have husbands and three kids already ? But that 's not grown up enough for you ? Or is it just because I 'm a woman ? And if you say it is , I swear I 'll never speak to you again . " " A welcoming thought at the moment . " Neither of them meant it , but you could n't tell that by looking at them . Courtney Straton watched her husband and only daughter glaring at each other and sighed long and loud , hoping to get their attention . It did n't work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when Chandos and Casey argued , subtlety did n't work . She doubted they even recalled that she was there . This was an old argument . However , it had never been this heated before . Ever since Fletcher Straton had died last year , the ultimate fate of the Bar M Ranch was in question . The ranch would have belonged to Chandos , but Fletcher , knowing his son , had put a provision in his will that if Chandos refused the inheritance , the ranch would then go in equal shares to his three grandchildren . Which was exactly what had happened . Chandos did n't need the ranch . He had done well for himself . The incentive had been there , to prove to his father that he could match him , and he 'd done that well enough . He might not own quite as many acres , but he had just as many head of cattle , and his house was nearly twice as large as Fletcher 's , which made it almost a mansion . Combined , the Bar M and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because they were owned by father and son , most folks had always considered them combined . It was only the father and the son who did n't , and now only Chandos who still insisted on keeping them separate . But separate did n't mean allowing his daughter to run the ranch . He was quick to temper , and Casey was n't helping matters by turning stubborn on this particular subject no matter how serious she was about it . They were much alike , these two . Unlike her two fair-haired brothers , Tyler at eighteen and Dillon , who was only fourteen , Casey took after Chandos in temperament and in looks . She got her hair from him , black as pitch . She got her height from him , making her , at five feet nine inches , about the tallest girl in the county . The only thing Casey had inherited from Courtney was her remarkable eyes . On Casey , they were like softly glowing amber jewels . And for all that she professed to be a woman and was one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such young ages , she was late in filling out . Tall , lean , and lanky like her father , though without his muscles . Yet she was a very pretty girl , if she would be still long enough for one to notice . Trouble was , Casey was never still . Standing , sitting , she was always in motion of one sort or another , pacing , or talking with her hands , or walking with long , masculine strides . But if you caught her in a quiet moment , you 'd notice how large her eyes were , how flawlessly smooth her skin was under her tan , how her nose was shaped rather pertly . Her brows were a bit too thick , her chin a bit too stubborn -- like her father's -- but added to her finely chiseled cheekbones , these features were n't so noticeable . What was disconcerting , though , was that she had the same uncanny ability as Chandos to hide her emotions when she chose to , completely , so that you had no idea whatsoever what she was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Casey had another of Chandos 's traits -- strategizing . When one tactic did n't work , she usually resorted to another . Shouting had n't worked , so she switched to a calmer tone . " But the Bar M needs someone in command . " " Sawtooth is doing well enough . " " Sawtooth is sixty-seven years old . He was retired and living peacefully on his little spread when Grandpa died . He agreed to take over the reins only until you could find someone else . But you have n't found anyone willing to take on those responsibilities without demanding half the profits , and you refuse to manage the place yourself . " " I have enough headaches here . I do n't have time to divide myself --  " " But I do , and I can do it . You know I can . The Bar M is one-third mine . I have every right --  " " You 're not even eighteen yet , Casey --  " " What 's eighteen got to do with anything , I 'd like to know ? And besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which is when you should be thinking about getting married and starting your own family . You ca n't do that if you 're saddled with running the Bar M. " " Marriage ! " the girl snorted . " I 'm only talking about a couple years , Daddy , just until Tyler finishes college . There is n't anything I do n't know about running a ranch . You saw to that . You taught me all I know about ranching , all I know about surviving on the trail --  " " Biggest mistake I ever made , " Chandos mumbled . " No , it was n't . " Courtney spoke up finally . " You wanted her to be able to handle any situation if we were n't around to handle it for her . " " Exactly , " Chandos said . " If we were n't around . " " I want to do this , and you have n't given one good reason why I should n't . " " Then you have n't been listening , little girl , " Chandos said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a female that the forty-some wranglers on the Bar M are not going to want to take orders from , and you 've reached the time in your life when you should be looking for a husband . You wo n't be finding one with your nose buried in ranch accounts and coming in off the range each day sweat-soaked and filthy . " Casey was red-faced by then , most likely from anger , though it was hard to tell . " Marriage again ! " she all but sneered . " There has n't been a man around these parts in the last two years worth my taking notice of . Or do you want me to marry just anyone ? If that 's the case , I can think of a dozen men who are eligible . I 'll go rope me one tomorrow , if that 's what it 'll take to --  " " Do n't be impertinent . " " I 'm being absolutely serious , " Casey insisted . " You 'd let a husband of mine run the Bar M , would n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have a candidate for you no later than --  " " You 'll do no such thing . You will not marry just to get your hands on those account ledgers --  " " I 've had my hands on those account books for months now , Daddy . Sawtooth is half blind , if you did n't realize it . Trying to tally the ledgers gives him a powerful headache that actually makes him physically ill . " It was Chandos who was red-faced now , and there was no doubt in his case that it was from anger . " Why was n't I told about this ? " " Maybe because every time Sawtooth rides over here to see you , you 're out on the range somewhere . And maybe because you wo n't step foot on the Bar M to find out why he came over in the first place . And maybe because you do n't really care about the Bar M. You 'd just as soon see it fall to ruin now that Grandpa 's gone , just to spite his memory . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone . But Casey had already blanched . She 'd gone too far and knew it . And before her father could blast her for doing so , she ran from the room . Courtney started to assure Chandos that Casey had just let her emotions run away with her , that she had n't really meant what she 'd said ; but , tight-lipped , he marched out of the room right behind Casey . Only not to follow her . He headed off toward the back of the house , a more direct route to the stable , while she 'd run toward the front . Which was entirely too bad . Chandos should n't have let the argument end like that , with Casey riddled with guilt now , but still determined to change her father 's mind . He should have been more explicit with his reasons . He should have pointed out that he did n't want to see Casey get hurt when she failed , which she was bound to do . The cowboys on the Bar M might accept her for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably there would be new men , and those who did n't know her and had n't known Fletcher would start dissension soon enough . It might be different if she were an older woman , a widow or the like , but she was n't . Most men simply would n't take orders from a woman , much less one they considered a young girl . But Chandos had n't mentioned any of that , at least not clearly enough . Courtney would have to talk to her herself , though she would give her a day or two to calm down first . Casey was unpredictable when her emotions were riled . CHAPTER TWO When Casey stormed from the room , she did n't head upstairs . The front porch was closer , and at this time of the morning it was usually empty and peaceful . Today was no different . It was a big porch , only ten feet wide but some eighty feet long , fronting the entire length of the house . It was filled with small white tables and chairs , a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profusion of plants that her mother babied and that hid the numerous spittoons the ranch hands made use of . She moved to the railing , gripping it until her knuckles fumed white . As far as the eye could see was Straton land , either her father 's or her grandfather 's , vast plains dotted with the occasional hill or a lonely stand of trees around a watering hole , and the usual cactuses and fauna of Texas . There was a forest on the northern border , but you could n't see it from the house . A creek bed divided the two properties . Farther south , they shared a freshwater lake teeming with bass . It was stark land , it was beautiful land . Yet on that fine spring morning Casey noticed nothing . She never should have said what she did to her father , but then , he 'd been so unreasonable . And choking on both guilt and anger was n't an easy thing to deal with . Anger she was used to , growing up with two brothers who delighted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something that might be true ... What else was she to think ? Her father had always given the impression that he really did n't care about the Bar M. He did n't want anything to do with anything that had ever belonged to Fletcher Straton . Everyone knew that . Yet Casey had loved her grandfather . She had never understood why he and Chandos could n't bury the hatchet , so to speak , and get along after all these years . Fletcher had made every effort . But Chandos was unyielding . She knew the history , of course -- how Meara , Fletcher 's wife , had left him , apparently because of his unfaithfulness . She had taken their son with her , and although Fletcher had searched far and wide for them , intent on bringing them home , they had completely disappeared . He did n't find out how they had managed to elude him so thoroughly until years later , when Chandos showed up at the Bar M. He had been lucky he had n't been shot on sight riding in on his pinto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little else . He 'd looked like a full-fledged Indian , all except for his deep blue eyes , Meara 's eyes , and the only way his father was able to recognize him . To hear Fletcher tell it , Meara had left him in a fit of temper without taking the precautions she should have before running off . She and her child had been captured by Kiowas and sold to a Comanche . They had been fortunate , though . The young brave had taken Meara to wife and adopted Chandos . A few years later , another child was born of that union , Chandos 's half-sister , White Wing , whom he had adored . He had been a child himself at the time of the capture , and it was n't until ten years later , when he was eighteen and ready to take his place in the tribe as an adult , that Meara had sent him home to his father . She had wanted him to experience living in the white man 's world before he chose the Comanche way of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he would have done anything his mother asked of him , but his decision had already been made . He had been raised by the Comanches . As far as he was concerned , he was a Comanche . But he was n't averse to learning all he could from the whites , as he had thought of them at the time . Know thine enemy was n't only a white man 's creed . The trouble was , Fletcher , thrilled to have his son back , thought Chandos was there to stay , so he could n't understand his son 's hostility . And Fletcher , stubborn , belligerent , and autocratic in those days , had managed to increase that hostility , not lessen it . They argued constantly , with Fletcher trying to mold Chandos into the son he wanted him to be . But Chandos was no child at that age . The breaking point came when Fletcher ordered his men to corral Chandos and cut off his braids . It was quite a fight , to hear Fletcher tell it , with Chandos wounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off , three years after he 'd shown up . Fletcher had thought to never see him again . Later , the old man discovered that Chandos had returned to his tribe to find most of them dead , massacred by a group of whites , his mother and sister both raped and killed , and this had happened the very day he 'd gone home to them . For four years he and the few remaining men of that small band of Comanches had tracked down the killers to exact their revenge , and brutal it was , as brutal as the massacre of all the women and children of the band had been . It was during that time that Chandos had met Courtney Harte , Casey 's mother . They had fallen in love . Chandos had eventually made the decision to settle on the property that belonged to Courtney 's family and adjoined his father 's ; he wanted to compete with Fletcher and prove that he could be just as successful at ranching without his help . He 'd had a fortune in the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he never touched that money , likely never would . What Chandos created , he did on his own . Chandos and Fletcher , father and son , never made peace , at least not that anyone was aware of . And even though Fletcher was dead , Chandos had n't buried their differences with him . Yet one day the two ranches would be combined through Chandos 's children , and that probably did n't sit well with him at all , which was why he 'd as soon see the Bar M go under than get the proper management it needed . But Casey never should have said so aloud . She could believe it all she liked , but to actually say it was an insult of the worst sort , and she had never insulted her father before . She did n't hear any footsteps come up behind her , yet she was asked , " You gon na cry now , missy ? " Without turning around , she knew who had joined her and must have been near enough to overhear the fight she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty close to Sawtooth after Fletcher 's death , close enough for him to easily question her and expect answers . " What good will tears do ? " she replied in a tight voice . " Never served no purpose in my opinion , ' cept to make a man squirm . What are you gon na do , then ? " " I 'm going to prove to Daddy that I do n't need a husband to get by , that I can work in a man 's world just fine without having one tied to my apron strings . " " Not that you 'll ever wear aprons . " He chuckled at the idea of it . " But just how you gon na do that ? " " By getting a job that is n't suited for a woman , " Casey answered . " Ai n't many jobs that are suited for a woman , let alone those that ai n't . " " I mean really unsuitable , dangerous maybe , or something so strenuous a woman would never consider it . Was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scout , too ? " " From what I heard tell , that Oakley girl looked more like a man than some men do , dressed like it , too . But what 's your point ? You ai n't thinking of doing something stupid like that , are you ? " " Stupid ' is a matter of opinion . The point is , I need to do something . Daddy is n't going to just miraculously change his mind . He 's as hardheaded as they come , and we know where he got that from , do n't we ? " There was a snort . Sawtooth had been a good friend of Fletcher 's , after all . But he also admitted , " I 'm beginning to not like the sound of this . " " Well , too bad , " she grumbled . " I was n't asking for permission . But I was n't expecting to have to prove myself either , when Daddy already knows I 'm capable , so this will require some thought . " " Thank God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of me. "
