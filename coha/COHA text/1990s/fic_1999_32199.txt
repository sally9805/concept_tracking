When we lived on Menard Avenue , I used to lie half-awake listening to my parents ' conversation after the Bing Crosby program or Amos and Andy . So I heard their conversation about love between Rosemarie and me . I slept on an old couch in the enclosed front porch of our small third-floor apartment . My brother , Mike ( called Michael by everyone else in the family ) , five years younger , slept on another couch against the opposite wall after he had graduated from his crib . Thick , royal blue drapes , tattered and worn , were drawn to shut out the streetlights , and an old carpet protected our feet from the concrete floor . In the winter a wheezy electric heater , glowing like a rising sun , and several layers of blankets kept us warm . Dilapidated shades hung on the other side of the glass doors to the living room . The doors would not close tightly so it was easy to hear my parents , but difficult to stay awake and follow what they were saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , remembered , they may exist once again and forever , are hazy and insubstantial . The different time periods in my first twelve years , so long in their duration at the time , are mingled in my recollections . The boundaries between sleep and half-sleep , that magic time when you are still awake to enjoy your dreams , are uncertain . What I actually heard , what I dreamed I heard , what I wanted to hear , what I created because of my later experiencesall are fused in an intricate puzzle over which has been spread a patina of nostalgia , a golden glow of reconstructed joy with anoccasional sharp pain . The conversation I am about to describe certainly happened . I can locate it in timelate summer of 1940 : Knute Rockne , All American , with Pat O'Brien as the Rock and a kid named Reagan as George Gipp , the Fall of France , the Battle of Britain , the German-American Bund , boogie-woogie , nylons , the early color movies ( God 's Country and the Woman was the first I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Roosevelt , fifty-cent haircuts , and ten-cent beer . I know the date because it was after our visit to the Clancys ' borne in Lake Geneva and my disgrace . I was a month short of my twelfth birthday . The worst of the Depression was over , but , as my parents would say , we had thought that before . Although I recall lines of worry and exhaustion on both their faces , I do not remember anxious conversations about the Depression . Since I would later be obsessed by the Depression and our poverty , it is not likely that I would forget such discussions if they had taken place . They would occasionally laugh about the day their " ship comes in , " a common phrase in those days to anticipate in fantasy a prosperity that no one ever expected to see again . Mostly their colloquies were interchanges between two good friends who shared many interests , including ( though by no means exclusively ) the four children for whom they were , surprisingly it seemed to them , responsible and St. Ursula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I recall the affectionate sound of their voices , the gentle outer surface of the masks they had adopted in their commedia dell'arte : my mother naive and shrewd , my father experienced and realistic . The tones were mere hints of character , and not always accurate revelations of the person behind the persona . Nonetheless , I find myself on the edge of tears when I re-create , hopefully forever , those lost voices of gentle love . I can not recollect quarrels . Later my father would tell me that my mother 's temper , once aroused , was a fearsome spectacle . Still later he would explain that I was unlikely ever to see it because she reserved such displays for her bedroom . Yet later he would hint that the reason was that in her personality one strong passion quickly changed to another . Were these preludes to interludes of intense emotion when they went to their bedroom ? I must ask whether perhaps I came to be as part of one such episode . I know that science does not believe the emotional atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover it requires hours for sperm to penetrate egg after it has been sent on its frantic rush . But if I am the result of such an episode of anger turned to violent tenderness , it would explain a hell of a lot . We loved to listen to the radio after supper and hum along or sing with the music , such as Glenn Miller 's " Imaginary Ballroom " and Carmen Miranda 's " Begin the Beguine , " which I still find myself humming occasionally . Sometimes they were quiet after the radio was turned off and we children had all gone to bed , not very often . I was not an eavesdropper much less a voyeur . I listened to the voices because they were there to listen to . If perhaps the conversation was about me , what harm was there in knowing where you stood ? Right ? I remember the content of few of their talks , so I must have been the subject only rarelyhardly appropriate for the firstborn son . They did comment on Jane 's " first period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest notion what it was , more appropriate for repugnance than for Mom 's rejoicing , Often they talked about Peg 's beauty and emerging talent on the violin . " She is special , " my father would say . " And such a dear , " my mother would add . Fair enough . My little sister , Peg , was my favorite person in all the world , Wendy , I thought , to my Peter Pan . She became objectionable only in the company of the Clancy brat . They did lament one night my failure on the flute . " But he has a fine voice . I think he 'll be a tenor , do n't you , dear ? " " He 'll be all right . " " And he 's clever with his cute little camera , though I do n't know what that 's good for , do you ? " " He could become a world-famous photographic artist . There are such people , you know . " " Would n't that be cute ? " If I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be a world-famous picture taker . At the threshold of sleep , I think I was flattered . On that pleasantly cool night in late August of 1940 when they talked of Rosie and me , I was so close to sleep that I almost chose to ignore their exchange even though it seemed to be about me . Dad : " I do n't think there 's any chance for the poor little tyke . Her mother drinks and her father is ... well , you know what he is . " Mom : " She and Peg are like two : peas in a pod . They even managed to have their first periods the same week ! " Dad : " They 'll probably have their first children on the same night . " Laughter from the two parents . I look over that bit of dialogue and shake my head . Both little girls were going on ten . I must have remembered that exchange from a later overheard exchange . You see how hard this " remembrance of things past " is ? Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story fight . My humiliation that day at Lake Geneva is imprinted on my memory in all its rich detail and will never be erased . Nor am I likely to forget the first time I ever kissed a girl . Even if I was going on twelve and she was going on ten . As I type those lines onto my word processor screen , I remember the joy of that moment . I tasted the sweetness of my awakening sexuality , surely ; but , even more , I tasted the sweetness of the power of my tenderness to wipe away tears . As I said to two psychiatrists , one my brother-in-law and one my son , in a late-evening conversation a couple of years ago , " There is no such thing as a latency period between infancy and puberty . A man always wants women , no matter how old he is . During what you guys call latency years , his desire for women is overwhelmed by his fear of them . " They admitted that my position was not unreasonable . Mom : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like either of her parents , poor dears . " Dad : " I still ca n't believe Clarice married him . " Mom : " She wanted to have a child . She thought he 'd be kinder than her father . Maybe he is . Remember what the Gypsy woman said : that Clarice would have a little girl who would do great things . Maybe we can help Rosemarie , even if we could n't help her parents . And she so adores our little Chucky . " Dad : " They 're children , April . " Mom : " Children love too . Our Chucky is a devilish little imp. but I think he is really fond of her . He pretends to tease her , but he really is very kind to her . " I think I wondered uneasily , seven-eighths asleep as I was , whether they knew about the final scene of that ugly day at Lake Geneva . I was pretty sure she would tell no one , not even Peg . It was our secret , was n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , she told Peg . She told Peg everything . Dad : " If he was n't , Peg would sock him . " Mom : " I think Rosemarie is trying to adopt us . " Dad : " Not a wise choice , given our finances . " Mom : " Dear , it 's not money the poor child is looking for . " Dad : " Well , April , what do we do about her ? " Mom : " We ca n't turn her away , can we ? " Dad : " I suppose not ... and Chucky ? " Mom : " Should n't we let nature take its course and see what happens ? Even now , when he 's not being Peck 's Bad Boy , they make a cute couple , do n't you think ? " Dad ( after a contemplative pause ) : " If we 're the only ones who can help her , we certainly should do what we can . Maybe we can save her . " Mom : " Maybe , dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , I would have liked to think I was furious at their dialogue . How dare they make such decisions about a boy my age . Besides , I felt no emotion for Rosie Clancy other than distaste . She was a spoiled rich brat , the daughter of a wealthy man whom I despised , in great part because of his wealth . If I had been able to face up to my real feelings in those days , I would have had to admit that Rosemarie was on my mind constantly even then . I pretended to dislike her , but in fact , she dazzled me . Her face , her body , her long black hair , her laughter , her quick wit , her obvious intelligence , had created fascination and fearin roughly equal partsin my soul . I think that as I fell asleep that night on Menard Avenue , I knew that somehow our destinies would be intertwined . I may even have felt happy about that fate .               @ @ @ @ @ @
