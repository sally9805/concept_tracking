<p> People in the rest of the United States often think of Northern Californians as crackpots . We 're willing to live on earthquake faults and put up with all kinds of quirky behavior . But if we 're such oddballs , why do most of us live in conventional houses ? The answer is : Not all of us do . <p> Some people create drastically different environments . They do n't imitate their neighbors . They express themselves . <p> Indeed , the Bay Area abounds with weird houses . Here 's a look at a few of them  --  and the unconventional people who created them . <p> Let 's start with Karen Wyse , an artist who lives in Orinda with her husband , Matt . Their 1902 house , built by shipbuilders , appealed to her from the start . <p> " I learned that the house had been built back in 1902 by a ferryboat captain and his rabble-rouser wife , Edith Small Corson , " says Wyse . " The captain got a boat-building company from San Leandro to come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that built the ferries for San Francisco Bay . <p> " When you walk up the stairs , you feel like you 're walking onto the deck of a ship . The kitchen and all the cabinets are built with the efficiency of space that you need at sea . " <p> Edith Corson did n't really want to sell , but that did n't deter Wyse , who had fallen in love with the house and its surrounding oak trees . <p> " She was getting lots of offers and it took me 17 visits to convince her that I was the one to take care of it , " Wyse says . " She loved the trees , and I promised not to cut them down . Furthermore , I was a wild-looking ' 70s hippie , loaded down with exotic jewelry , and I think she identified with that . " <p> Wyse has made the house her own , covering the inside and outside walls with art and building a huge Gaudi-esque sculpture that doubles as a hot tub . <p> " Whenever people , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're mesmerized by the place . I do n't even think about selling . The decoration affirms who I am  --  the art is like my children . How could you sell your children ? " <p> THE SEA , THE SEA <p> Water also plays a part in other weird homes in the Bay Area . <p> In Sausalito 's houseboat community , for instance , there 's the famous floating version of the Taj Mahal . The 4,500-square-foot colonnaded houseboat , highlighted by onion- shaped domes , features two kitchens , a hidden elevator , a meditation pavilion , a wine cellar and an all- black bedroom . Even among Sausalito 's eclectic houseboat architecture , this one stands out . <p> And in the flatlands of Berkeley is the Fish House , a controversial structure conceived in 1991 by visionary architect Eugene Tsui . The house got its name because of its fins , tentacles , round windows and an open mouth that 's used as a garage . <p> Tsui says his buildings do n't appeal to everyone because they do n't fit the traditional image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindergarten days when the teacher asks you to draw a house , " he says . " Almost everyone draws the same square house with the pitched roof and the tree out front . By the time we reach adulthood , these images are in the unconscious , and we seek the familiar . " <p> Tsui also built an unusual Dragonfly House in Oakland in 1993 . The house features two 18-foot winglike fiberglass structures that open in the summertime and deflect breezes down into a solarium ; in winter , the wings are closed and insulated . <p> Another Tsui creation in Berkeley is a conical-shaped addition to a traditional California bungalow . Tsui says the cone is extremely stable in earthquakes , and it combines the roof and wall into one unified surface , which saves on materials . The addition also features a hemispherical six-foot skylight as the main lighting source . <p> The architect feels that traditional , rectilinear shapes do n't make sense ; nature is the supreme architect and nature never builds with boxy or flat shapes . <p> " The way we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're wasting materials and labor on houses that are structurally inefficient . Nature is billions of years ahead of human intelligence . We can take this intelligence and apply it immediately . " <p> THEY 'RE EVERYWHERE <p> As you start to become aware of unusual houses , you 'll spot them all over Northern California . <p> There 's Carlo Marchiori 's art- filled Villa Ca'Toga in Calistoga ; it 's a Palladian-style palazzo with huge frescoes depicting mythological creatures , archaeological ruins and other scenes . The garden features a Roman pool and a sculpture courtyard . <p> " I built Ca'Toga from zero , " says Marchiori . " It is my retirement house that one has to build for oneself . . . In a way it 's simple , but in the gardens and inside you see the delight of imagination take over . I 've added faux classical Roman ruins because I like to surrender to time . The statues are personal ; they 're my follies . I have a Greek temple in the back of the house . <p> " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , you do n't want to sell your soul . Not even to the devil . " <p> There 's the so-called Flintstone House in Hillsborough , built in 1976 by William Nicholson . Constructed of six different-shaped domes covered with cement , the house features round rooms and 30- foot-high ceilings . <p> " I heard that the original owner wanted to build a home for the future  --  a model for the future , " says Tom Petika , who lived in the house with his wife , Dorothy , for 10 years . The couple sold it in 1996 to move to Santa Rosa . <p> " My wife and I always called it our Dome Home , but the name Flintstone House evolved from other people , " he says . <p> " We found that place a fun house . I remember when we first moved in , my wife Dorothy and I would walk in and kind of laugh . <p> " Nothing in the house was perfectly symmetrical . No ceiling was the same height from room to room . Everything was round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was originally built , there were no interior doors . In no time we had a door man up there . That was too bizarre for us . " <p> Farther south in Cambria , there 's Nitt Witt Ridge , built by Art Beal , a garbageman who died in 1992 . Beal spent 64 years adding to his dwelling with objects he found beachcombing and scavenging at dumps . It 's filled with things like boulders , large abalone shells , antlers used as racks , the fronts of old radios made into cabinets and decanters planted in cement as garden decor . <p> HOW MUCH IS WEIRD WORTH ? <p> If you fall in love with one of these homes and the owner wants to sell it , is it a smart idea to buy it ? What about building one of your own ? <p> First of all , you 'll probably have gawkers . The Fish House , for example , initially attracted a few hundred curiosity seekers daily , but now " there are maybe 50 cars a day that stop , " Tsui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are n't always pleased to have an unusual house on their block . The Fish House rattled several neighbors when it was built  --  and some unsuccessfully opposed certain features at a meeting of the City of Berkeley 's zoning board . <p> And Hillsborough 's Flintstone House disturbed at least one neighbor . " He wanted to buy it and bulldoze it , " Petika says . " So he helped create ( an ) architectural review board so there would never ever be another home like that built in Hillsborough . " <p> Some real estate agents warn against purchasing such a house or doing anything really unusual to your own home . When it comes time to sell , they say , you 'll have to find someone with the same weird taste . <p> But while unusual homes may take longer to sell than their conventional counterparts , they still can command good prices . Owners like Petika report making a profit when they sell . <p> In cases like these , buyers who want these houses want them with a passion . So , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Express yourself . <p> THE STRUGGLE TO PRESERVE OFFBEAT BUILDINGS <p> With land at such a premium in California , developers are all too ready to raze unusual homes and replace them with new building projects . The good news is that weird- home advocates are fighting back . <p> Here 's what 's happening to Schultz , a gregarious guy who does n't use a first name and has a mischievous look in his eye . <p> Schultz lives and works in an 1879 building on the Oakland Estuary  --  " the neighborhood time forgot , " he says . He has spent years decorating and adding on to his living space with old boat parts , musical instruments , abandoned cars , found art and giant palm trees . He 's also installed an entire community of other creative craftsmen . <p> But this may be coming to an end because the city and the Port of Oakland are studying an idea to clear the area and use it for an exhibition ground in 2001 . <p> Schultz and his community plan to fight any such move . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oakland wants my land , " he says . " This is an emotional point in my life . I ca n't believe I 'll live to see this building torn down . " <p> Schultz and his cohorts are n't alone in the battle to save weird buildings . Back in the ' 60s , Seymour Rosen of Los Angeles led the fight to save Simon Rodia 's Watts towers , and since then has spearheaded an organization called Spaces , which is dedicated to preserving unusual environments . <p> When Rosen first tried to save these sites , he ran into all kinds of bureaucracy in Sacramento . Unconventional buildings fell between the cracks of folk art , art and architecture . <p> In a brilliant move , Rosen got the state Office of Historic Preservation to declare the whole state of California a historic district . He explains that if the state declares a property a historic landmark , this " acknowledges the worthiness of the project and its historical significance within California . " <p> This has cleared the way for spots with taste and a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you drive through Pope Valley in Napa County , you 'll see one of Rosen 's projects , Hub Cap Ranch . In the sunlight , it 's a startling sight : a ranch and its fences covered with shiny hubcaps . <p> Rosen has made sure that anyone trying to do away with this unusual home will face a daunting series of steps . Out on the highway is a plaque that states the home is a California State Historic Landmark . <p> plant in cement as garden decor . <p> If you fall in love with one of these homes and the owner wants to sell it , is it a smart idea to buy it ? What about building one of your own ? <p> JOE FORMICA <p> A LOOK INSIDE THE ' HEARST CASTLE ' OF EL CERRITO <p> Joe Formica is n't an artist or an architect . He 's a retired insulator for Standard Oil . When he bought his El Cerrito house in 1945 for $ 5,000 , it had only 3 1/2 rooms . On his own , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof . <p> The house is filled with chandeliers , a huge cutout of Marilyn Monroe , a stuffed fish hanging behind the couch , neon paintings on the wall , a mermaid table , a collection of shaving brushes and peacock feathers . <p> Formica likens his house to Hearst Castle , with its larger scale classical decor . He says : " I 've got the same taste as Mr. Hearst , except he did his place with money . " <p> . <p> " When I first bought this house in 1945 , it was a plain two-story structure . Right away I started dreaming about how I could make it look like Hawaii . <p> " I put in some palm trees and Tiki gods in the front yard . I hung leis all over the place . For several years that was the style I wanted . <p> " Then I decided to change to the Roman style . I paid a visit to the Hearst Castle . Boy , was that beautiful . I went down to Los Angeles to buy Roman statues , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day I was heading to the Cow Palace and there was a man who had everything  --  Hercules , the Discus Throwers , everything . I told him I wanted to put these on my roof . He said nobody in California had put one on their roof . <p> " When I told my wife I was going to put one over the front door , she said , ' Do n't do it . We have a leak up there . ' I put the statue over the door and that was the end of the leak . For a while , I had a real lion in the back yard , but then my mother-in-law refused to come over , so we got rid of it . <p> " I loved my wife , but every time I started to do something she 'd say , ' Whoever saw a house with that ! ' I 'd say , ' That 's right , I 'm not a copycat . ' But then , after a neighbor would say I had imagination , she 'd change her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Every time I go outside to relax , people come over with questions  --  it 's a tourist attraction here in El Cerrito . Sometimes another homeowner seems annoyed , but I know it 's jealousy . <p> " I bought this house for $ 5,000 . Eight years ago a real estate agent told me it was worth over $ 200,000 . I 'll never sell it . I did all this for my wife who has now passed away . The house is still in her name . " <p> ANGELA FERINI <p> HOME ON THE STRANGE <p> If you 're going north on Highway 101 through Novato , you 'll spot some strange buildings on a hilltop to your left . Most noticeable is the large round structure with the spinning oil drums on the roof . <p> This offbeat neighborhood was created in the late 1950s and early ' 60s by the late putterer and inventor Sam Harkleroad . The eccentric Harkleroad was sometimes called the " Frank Lloyd Wright of Novato . " Angela Ferini now lives in one of the houses with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is my dream house . When I was growing up in San Rafael , I used to tell Mom I was going to run away to live in this house . <p> " We had an apartment , so this place seemed like the weirdest home in the world . All the kids in my neighborhood thought they could hide up here ; they 'd be protected because they could spot their parents walking up the long hill . <p> " Last year , I was going out with a guy , and one night he took me to his house . I was flabbergasted  --  it was this house . Six months later , I started living here , too . <p> " You can see everything that 's going on in Novato from this spot . These are three buildings . The one we 're renting looks like a taco . <p> " The next one to us is round and rotates daily using washing machine motors . The third building has a windmill , made out of oil drums , on the roof . It used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Whenever I meet any childhood friends , I tell them I 'm living up here . They say , ' No way ! ' I say , ' Yes , I do . ' " <p> EUGENE TSUI <p> SOMETHING 'S FISHY ABOUT THIS HOUSE <p> On the flatlands of Berkeley , on a street filled with modest one-story bungalows , architect Eugene Tsui built a home for his parents that stands in high contrast to its neighbors . Many people think it looks like a fish because of its fins , tentacles , round windows and an open mouth that 's used as a garage , but Tsui explains here what motivated the shape . <p> . <p> " Most people think the house I created for my parents looks like a fish . I do n't mind that , but the real impetus for this house was an organism called the tardigrade . <p> " The tardigrade is actually a mix between a worm and an insect with eight pudgy little legs . Scientists have found it to be the world 's most indestructible organism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , freeze it and suffocate it , but you just add water and it walks away . <p> " It 's got an oval shape and when you cut through it , you can see a series of parabolic arches  --  this arch is nature 's most compressive form . When I translated this into architecture , I got a structure that can literally float along tremors and shock waves . <p> " I wanted to build a house that was the ultimate solution for fire , flooding and earthquakes . This house can take all kinds of stress and disperse it , much like a boat . <p> " The windows are circular so it 's almost impossible for a crack to occur . The shape is elliptical so that air flows around it , undisturbed . The surface is dimpled so that air is not drawn to it . <p> " When flames hit a smooth surface , they create a vacuum and are suctioned toward the wall . . . . This house , being curvilinear and bumpy , pushes flame away . " My parents live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least that 's what they tell me . My mother was a physical therapist and she did n't want a home that would be hard on her knees and joints . So there are no stairs , only ramps . They also wanted an inward , cocoonlike feeling to their residence and that 's what they got . Their traditional Chinese curvilinear furniture fits in beautifully . <p> " A few neighbors think I built this as an advertisement for myself , but that 's not true . Students of all ages drive by here and are stimulated by the structure .
