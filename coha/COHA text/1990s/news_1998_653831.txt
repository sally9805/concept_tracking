<p> The gleaming marble and glass headquarters of MFK Renaissance , one of Russia 's leading investment banks , stands as tangible evidence of the financial gold rush that briefly swept through here . Limousines still park by the firm 's front doors , which abut the offices of Moscow 's pre-eminent power broker , Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov  --  quite a change from just three years ago , when MFK Renaissance operated from the spare confines of a former hotel disco . <p> But inside MFK Renaissance , beyond plush royal blue carpeting and elegantly upholstered furniture , the trading floor and its computers are eerily quiet . And for good reason . Most of the bank 's capital has been wiped out , most of its assets are nearly worthless , and the firm , like many other investment banks that not so long ago were speculating in Moscow 's booming markets , is scrambling to stay afloat . <p> " It 's like a football game here ; every player has taken a hit , " said Boris Jordan , 32 , MFK Renaissance 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue is who 's executing their responsibilities and moving the ball forward . From that perspective , MFK Renaissance is in fine shape and remains a market leader . " <p> Whatever its future , MFK 's meteoric rise and sudden implosion is more than just a tale of how quickly this boom town has become a financial ghost town . It is also a parable of international finance in the 1990 's that reveals how those who exploited the advantages of free markets and the unfettered flow of capital around the world are being swept up in the whirlwind . <p> " I think the lesson people will take from this is that the domino theory does work and there can be massive financial contagion , " said Tom Ashead , co-head of research at Brunswick Warburg , a Moscow brokerage firm . " But the contagion only revealed weaknesses that were already apparent in Russia , and they were weaknesses many investors chose not to see . " <p> For his part , Mr. Jordan was uniquely positioned to play a role near the center of Russia 's awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Jordan , a grandson of Soviet-era refugees who emigrated to America , was already a key adviser to the Russian Government . These services were combined with investment banking pursuits that placed Mr. Jordan at the heart of financial schemes that only postponed the day of reckoning for the Russian economy  --  and may have made it even worse . <p> Mr. Jordan , a native of Long Island , was part of a large contingent of Russian-Americans who arrived in Moscow in the late 1980 's and early 1990 's . Some were motivated by an interest in rebuilding the country . Others simply had dollar signs in their eyes . In either case , it proved easy to set up shop . <p> " People thought that if you had a Russian accent and some education you could be an investment banker or a stockbroker or anything else you wanted to be , " said Andrei Bogolubov , the Russian-American president of AB Image , a public relations firm in Moscow and a consultant to MFK Renaissance . " That seems like a long time ago now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment banking firm Kidder , Peabody &; Company , which no longer exists , and an Irish aircraft leasing company , before taking a job here with Credit Suisse First Boston in 1992 . He then managed to win Credit Suisse a position as an adviser to Moscow as the Russian Government began a huge privatization of state-owned companies . That campaign ended up turning them over mostly to insiders  --  some of whom are suspected of milking the assets for their own purposes  --  and to politically connected robber barons . <p> Mr. Jordan left Credit Suisse to start what became MFK Renaissance in 1995 , the same year that the second phase of privatization began . At the heart of this new phase was a controversial program begun in 1995 and known as loans-for-shares . The program allowed a handful of banks led by a powerful clique of Russian businessmen dubbed the " oligarchs " to lend the Government money in return for receiving controlling stakes in many of Russia 's most significant industrial concerns . <p> It was a process fraught with accusations of sweetheart deals and influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action . His firm , Renaissance Capital , developed a close alliance with Vladimir Potanin , a former Government official and an oligarch who was the head of Uneximbank , a Russian bank that gained control of several large nickel and oil companies . Uneximbank is an investor in the entity they put together , MFK Renaissance . <p> Mr. Jordan 's ascent , his financial holdings , and his contacts within the Russian Government led officials from the United States to call on him when they were in town . He attracted the hot money of hedge fund gurus like George Soros and Michael Dingman . Mr. Soros has an undisclosed sum invested with MFK Renaissance while Mr. Dingman , who sits on the board of Sidanko , a Russian oil concern controlled by Messrs . Jordan and Potanin , also holds an equity stake in the firm . <p> Mr. Dingman has been criticized for financial wheeling and dealing in the Czech Republic that ended up ruining many individual investors there , but Mr. Dingman said that criticism was " unfair " and does not apply to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I did n't do and am not doing in Russia , " Mr. Dingman said . " My commitment to Russia is deliberately long term . " <p> In the meantime , as Mr. Jordan and his firm grew richer , the Russian securities market was percolating . New Russian Government short-term securities that paid whopping interest rates , GKO 's , attracted a whole new crew of investors to Russia in 1996 and 1997 . Suddenly , Moscow seemed to be one of the world 's most promising financial centers and MFK Renaissance was one of the most active participants in the GKO market . " It was like you could hear the sound of money being made in the streets , " said an executive with an American investment bank here who requested anonymity . " It sorted of wafted up into your apartment or hotel window . " <p> But for some not caught up in the thrill of the money mill 's churning , it sounded more like a casino gone wild . <p> " It was a classic sort of bubble and there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economist with the Russian-European Center for Economic Policy . " People bought because the market was going up , not because the fundamentals were sound . Lots of investors , serious investors , did n't even know there were big Government deficits here . It became ridiculous . " <p> In fact , the GKO 's paid such lofty interest rates  --  30 percent to 50 percent annually and as high as 150 percent earlier this spring  --  because the Russian Government 's deficit was ballooning . <p> A key factor in Russia 's collapse was a failure to collect taxes , which were supposed to replace the revenues previously generated by state-owned enterprises . And with oil prices collapsing , Russia could no longer count on enough money from what had been its most valuable resource . Without enough revenues to pay its bills , and to support ailing local banks that owned the bonds , Russia issued more GKO 's with ever-higher interest rates attractive to foreign and domestic investors  --  a short-term fix that eventually buried the Government under a pyramid of debt that collapsed last month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian ruble , contributing to international fears about the soundness of other emerging markets as well . <p> " Unfortunately , I think the GKO market did n't bring any real investment to the Russian economy , " said Dmitri Vasiliev , chairman of Russia 's Federal Commission for the Securities Market . " It just covered very high Government deficits . " <p> Anyone close to the Russian Government , or even remotely familiar with its finances , should have seen that investing in GKO 's in the absence of a sound tax policy was nothing but a speculative game . <p> But Mr. Jordan said he came to Moscow to help rejuvenate the economy and did not see his crucial participation in the GKO market as detrimental to Russia . He said that as an investor he had to be rewarded for the risk he took in buying the bonds and that they were " constructive " until the Government " mangled " them to plug fiscal gaps . <p> He is also smarting from the malaise created by the GKO debacle . An individual close to the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm 's capital , about $200 million at the end of last year , has nearly been wiped out . He said the firm had about $2 billion in assets at the end of last year that are worth about $200 million now  --  and many of those assets will be entirely written off . <p> MFK Renaissance also owes about $100 million on hedging contracts . It is owed $200 to $300 million by local banks , but it has little chance of collecting the money since most Russian banks are now insolvent . <p> Mr. Jordan , who has spent lavishly renovating a home in the exclusive Zhukovka district outside Moscow , said he had no holdings abroad other than " cash " and was committed to staying in Russia unless his family was threatened by the downturn . <p> " We pioneered this market and did n't jump on planes when the tanks rolled in 1993 or when the market collapsed in 1995 , " he said . " We intend to remain at the forefront through this cycle , too .
