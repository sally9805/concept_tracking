<p> THE demise of President Clinton 's economic stimulus package brought to public attention the peculiar rules of the United States Senate . The Senate has no general rule that limits debate . Instead , it has Rule 22 , which requires three-fifths of all senators - 60 in the current Senate - to vote to close debate . And the Senate has no general rule that requires that amendments to legislation be germane to the pending legislation . <p> In recent years , these rules have fueled hyperindividualism and petty obstructionism in the Senate . Pressured by lobbyists and eager to demonstrate their commitment to key constituency groups , senators have abused their parliamentary privileges and undermined the role of the Senate as a policymaking body . <p> The change is reflected in the number of times the cloture motion - a motion to close debate and bring a matter to a vote - has been subjected to a vote . The period from 1919 to 1970 saw a total of 50 cloture votes - less than one a year . The 1971-92 period saw 295 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1991-92 , set a record with 48 cloture votes . Even the motion to take up a bill on the floor is now subject to obstructionism . From 1977 through 1982 , only six cloture votes on the motion to proceed to the consideration of a bill took place ; in 1991 and 1992 , the Senate cast 35 such votes . These numbers only scratch the surface of obstructionism that is commonplace in today 's Senate . <p> In this year of political reform , it is time for senators to take stock of their institution and adopt essential changes in their rules . The current rule allows three-fifths of all duly elected and sworn senators - 60 , if all seats are filled - to invoke cloture , except on matters pertaining to Senate rules , for which a more stringent two-thirds majority of those present and voting is required . Rule 22 is not strong enough . Its unfortunate effects are seen every day in the Senate 's dependence on unanimous-consent agreements and the perverse practice of holds . <p> Since before the Civil War , Senate floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent agreements . In the modern Senate , the majority leader seeks unanimous consent to bring a bill to the floor and often seeks consent to structure debate and action on agreements . In the absence of general rules limiting debate and amendments , unanimous consent is the only recourse . So a simple request for unanimous consent to limit debate or amendments is the standard approach . Dependence on unanimous consent to lend some order to floor activity also means that a single senator can upset the leader 's plans . Consequently , the majority leader consults with the minority leader and other interested senators before seeking consent on all but the most routine questions . In recent decades , this process of anticipating and recording objections has become institutionalized . Well-understood routines are in place for senators to register objections , reservations , and concerns about requests to take up bills , nominations , and even treaties . <p> The registered objections are known as holds , reflecting their potential effect on legislation . Most holds delay floor consideration of legislation . Rather than risking objections to his unanimous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually attempts to get the objecting senator to release a hold . <p> As recently as the early 1960s , senators did not threaten filibusters with much frequency . They tended to reserve the filibuster for the most important issues . For Southerners , this meant using the filibuster against civil rights legislation and some labor legislation , but little else . Senators did not use holds with much frequency or effectiveness . <p> But as the political world changed so did Senate behavior . Senators responded to their new world by taking on more committee assignments , expanding their staffs , adding travel funds , and upgrading their office technology . Their schedules are now shaped more by personal agendas : campaign needs , interest-group demands , personal staff , obligations to meet constituents , speaking trips . And more trips home , state-based offices , polling , and constituency mail have made senators more sensitive , even hypersensitive , to public opinion . Extreme individualism is the result . <p> The external orientation of many senators has radically altered floor politics in the Senate . Pressed by constituents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now more routinely and more fully exploit their procedural prerogatives than at any other time in the Senate 's history . Filibusters , multiple amendments , and holds are all-purpose tools to gain leverage over committee chairmen , the leadership , and the administration . To cope with these circumstances , the majority leader is forced to conduct extended negotiations with the minority leader , and sometimes more than a dozen senators , to get routing bills before and through the Senate . He must spend hour after hour negotiating closing agreements that make the Internal Revenue Code seem simple . The agreements represent the effort of the majority leader to lend some predictability to floor action , expediting final action on bills by preventing obstructionism whenever possible , minimizing the effect of a filibuster on the consideration of other legislation , and juggling several pieces of legislation on the floor simultaneously - all while being sufficiently accommodating to gain unanimous consent . <p> In order to keep other legislation moving while some bill is being filibustered , the majority leader often seeks and receives consent to temporarily set aside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senators by a filibuster and increases their chances of success . The net effect may be to encourage filibusters . <p> Recent majority leaders - four in a row - have announced that holds are not binding on the leader and represent nothing more than a request for advance notification of floor action . These pronouncements have made little difference . Despite their frustration with holds , all four leaders found it convenient to observe holds most of the time . Why ? For one thing , the incentives for senators to abuse their parliamentary prerogatives are strong . Campaign contributors , lobbyists , and even the administration continue to reward senators who do their bidding . And the Senate 's ideologues care little about inconveniencing their leaders and colleagues . An edict from the majority leader does not change this condition . Teaching the Senate a lesson by forcing action against the will of a senator or two is likely to be a lesson that lasts only a few days . In any event , alienating a few senators by spitefully ignoring their holds may cost too much in subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for even the most routine of the leader 's unanimous consent requests . <p> The bottom line : A changing political context has made dysfunctional many rules and practices that once seemed well adapted to senators ' individual purposes and the Senate 's collective needs . Even leaders with the greatest intellects , creativity , and perseverance have not prevented the Senate from deteriorating as a policymaking body . <p> In the next few months , the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress will be devising proposals to improve the operations of the House and Senate . The Joint Committee should propose three sets of reforms for Senate floor procedure : <p> First , a simple majority should be allowed to adopt a motion to proceed to the consideration of a bill or conference report . Moreover , a simple majority should be allowed to bring debate to a close after a lengthy period of debate , say three days . The right to debate and offer amendments should be protected ; the right to avoid direct votes on important matters should be eliminated . <p> Second , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution on " a straight track , " a limited period of time , during which debate would be limited and amendments must be germane to the legislation . Before and after the Senate considers legislation on the straight track , senators ' current rights would be preserved . Most debate on legislation would occur in a more controlled and predictable setting . <p> Third , holds should be reduced by making it more difficult for a single senator to object to a floor leader 's request to call up a measure , limit debate , or limit amendments . The objections of at least five senators should be required in order to block such a request . If this were done , along with curbs on obstructionist quorum calls , the disruption caused by personalistic holds would be reduced . <p> Senate procedures have undermined the chamber 's special policymaking functions . Now is the time for us to insist that the Senate act to reform itself . But there is no reason to be optimistic about the prospects of meaningful reform . After all , any significant reform proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public demands that the Senate change its ways .
