When Richard Brooks ' In Cold Blood , the film based on Truman Capote 's celebrated nonfiction novel , was released in 1967 , a number of critics complained that it lacked a point of view . Unable to capture the real merit of the book  --  Capote 's masterly accretion of detail in telling the true story of a prosperous Kansas farm family 's gruesome murder  --  the film meanders about , touching on unoriginal themes : that men can kill with no good reason , that boys brutalized will grow up to brutalize , that the pure of heart often die in vain . <P> If these ideas were banal nearly 30 years ago , they seem even more so in the context of today 's habitually ugly headlines . It is curious , then , why anyone would tackle a remake of the film without having come up with anything more insightful to say about the nature of evil . Nevertheless , In Cold Blood the mini-series arrives this week ( Nov. 24 and 26 9 p.m . ET , CBS ) . <P> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine job conveying vulnerability as well as creepiness . But the movie ca n't seem to muster much of an opinion about these drifters and their crimes . This conceptual uncertainty may explain strange , meaningless scenes like one in which color suddenly fades to black and white and we see Roberts , moody and shirtless , playing guitar on a boat in Mexico as if he 'd run away to a Chris Isaak video . Maybe we are being told that society 's true enemy is the frustrated musician . <P>  --  By Ginia Bellafante
