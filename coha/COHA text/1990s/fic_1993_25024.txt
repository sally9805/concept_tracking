 | gathered . And now they were painting it pink . As if no one had been hurt . You could even hear the battle cries of the class struggle on festive occasions , such as the First of May . And you could still sometimes hear an ardent speech in the old style in the general meeting of the kibbutz . A style that no longer applies . Today 's style is different  --  cool , practical , efficient . Wise men do n't waste words . With me it 's the opposite . Then , I was cold and chilly , dissecting with a surgeon 's scalpel . Today , I tend to get emotional . Then my eyes were always dry . Today my tears are ready to flow . My mother 's tears , which dried up before their time , gush from my eyes . Even the Kinneret . Today it shines into my soul . As if my very guts were drowning in that jubilant blue . Then , I came here because I could n't find work anywhere else .

Hysteria does n't build roads . The Migdal junction . How many layers of asphalt have been put down on the stones I laid here . If I close my eyes I can wipe out all the buildings . And here I am , on a cart , a young pioneer in a gray cloth cap and a dirty white shirt , all his possessions tied up in a bundle on his knees . The cart trundled along the dirt track next to the road in the process of being built . The sky was blue as glittering steel . The water was the color of emeralds . The people sitting next to the piles of stones in their dusty clothes and dark cloth caps looked from a distance like flies on cones of sugar . The cart driver cracked his whip but the weary horse did not respond . " Here it is , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . Like a man reaching the end of the road . The final station . At the side of the road , in the shade of a eucalyptus , one of the Crimeans  --  the tsarskoye families or " royal family " they called them  --  a sturdy , handsome lad , stood drinking water from a narrow-necked clay jar which he held high above his head . Next p 101 to him stood a girl in a long white dress with her head bowed in a kind of meek expectancy . Was she in love ? Thirsty ? I 'll never be like them , I thought . The work was too much for me  --  it drained all my physical and mental powers . This is your last chance , I said to myself . With all my heart I longed to join this band of happy youths , breaking stones with economical movements and glorying in their achievements . Some accomplished more and some less , it made no difference  --  the payment for the contract labor was given to the group as a whole . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a decent contribution . This was a motive no less powerful than the threatening pressure exerted by a group of convict laborers : there you knew that if you were one of those who reduced the bread ration earned by the group , your comrades would leave you to die in the snow without lifting a finger to help you  --  but if your capacity for work was higher than average they would save your life and even carry you on their backs for miles , however exhausted they were . Among the Crimeans it was a different story . The worst that could happen to a poor worker there was that his disgrace would enhance the status of his comrades . At that time I was naively convinced that the part of the world they came from produced strength , joie de vivre , and mental health . At first I had only one friend there , a native of Kiev called Fineman . Our origins brought us together . He tried to pretend that he was a match for the rest of them in ardent enthusiasm , singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Saturday , when we were going for a walk in Capernaum and peeped into the monastery where a few monks were to be seen going reverentially about their business , he made a remark that was both related and unrelated to what we had been talking about : " As long as you enjoy your suffering you 'll never be a real worker  --  a real worker does everything in his power to avoid hard labor and liberate his children from his own fate . " This was a blasphemy my mind could not digest . I said to him , " Fineman , you must be feverish , you ca n't possibly mean what you 're say-  | ing . " And then I added spitefully , " You 'll never be a real worker because you ca n't stand the smell of your own sweat . You have to wash yourself three times a day .

People said things like that then without feeling presumptuous . In the end he admitted that he was in love with a certain girl and that he dreamed of a little house with a cow and a goat . I ridiculed him : " You 're a petit bourgeois with trivial , petit bourgeois dreams . I 'll forget what you 've just said , for your own good . " In the course of time he became the secretary of the Jerusalem Workers Council . Without a cow or a goat . From time to time Baruch Bashan left me in the car and went out to do whatever he had to do . I got out of the car and wandered around . Having a look . Nobody asked me what I wanted . In one kibbutz we had lunch . Then he went to the secretariat for a short discussion . I went down to the lake . Narrow paths , lawns , tall ficus trees , palms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communal buildings . The members ' apartments were modest , and different from each other . Some in a rustic style : red-tiled roofs , a garden surrounded with pruned myrtle bushes . Others like a suburban housing estate : two-story buildings , brick roofs , a road , a lawn , a garden enclosed by the houses around it . In the area of the workshops , a hive of activity : the racket of machines , a noisy tractor sweeping everything before it , a huge truck unloading its freight . In the residential area , peace and quiet . As if its inhabitants had all abandoned it . The noise of the work reaches here dimly , like the murmur of the sea . Among the bushes and the buildings a bit of the lake is visible . Shining , glittering . Quiet waters . Waves lower than the grass lap the black basalt boulders . Between one wave and the next  --  an eternity . Without a sound .  | The houses face the lake . In the gardens  --  deck chairs , hammocks , children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sat down on a boulder in a still eucalyptus glade and looked at the lake . The silence was as deep as the trees were high . A door opened behind me . I looked around . A woman was sitting on a bench on the porch of her house and idly pulling off her boots . When she saw me she drew her dress down over her bare knees . She stood and looked at me for a while and then vanished behind the door . A green door . Pictures from the past come in pairs . Then too I asked myself : Why not stop now , here , and stay for the rest of my life ? Here under these trees . With the water opposite me . And the mountains all around . ' This was after I was freed for the first time . I was free to live in another town . I was n't allowed to go west . But nevertheless I took the risk and stowed away on the train . Three days later they found me . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an isolated siding next to a junction they threw me off the train . Spite ? Generosity ? I do n't know . I found myself somewhere in the Urals . Without money , without papers . I walked along the railway tracks in the deep creek between two steep slopes . Suddenly I saw a clear lake in a secluded valley , with poplars on the opposite bank reflected in the water . The water was black and gleaming as ebony . Forests climbed the slopes on either side , exuding pungent forest smells . A milky mist was suspended over the heads of the fir trees . And on the banks of the lake , a little township : tiny white houses , like a child 's toys . I took my life in my hands and approached . Suddenly I said to myself : Why not here ? Now ? What more does a man need than a forest and a mountain , a lake and the peace of the poor . Far from Moscow . And an end to wandering . At that moment a tall woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched hut . Her body was full and strong , her cheekbones prominent , and there was an  | enchanting wildness in her big round eyes . She looked at me for a moment as if she was debating with herself . I said to myself : If she calls me , I 'll follow her . I 'll shut that green wooden door behind me and sever the thread connecting me to my life history forever . In this woman 's arms I 'll find perfect happiness and peace of mind . No one will come looking for Avigdor Berkov who was released from prison and lost in the Siberian wastes . The woman inspected me from top to toe with a frank , shameless look , and in the end she bent down , picked up a pail , and went down to the banks of the lake to draw water . I did n't stop there after all . I could n't find a job . I went on walking until I reached Klyuchi , a biggish , well-organized town in the middle of a hilly plain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old manor house that had been taken over by the militia , an ancient castle divided up between local artists and the Party institutions , and a woman who was willing to take me into her home . She was n't beautiful like the woman on the lake or wild like her . She never missed a single one of the performances of the local amateur dramatic society , and at concerts she wept with emotion . She soon wearied me with her provincial enthusiasm for the insipid verses of the local bard and her loud sniffs in the concert hall I felt no strong desire to go to ground in Klyuchi and open a new page in my life . I discovered the local post office and with the first pennies I earned at work I bought note paper and stamps . At the first opportunity I stowed away on the train traveling west . I did n't reach Moscow , because I was stopped on the way . But I did n't go back to Klyuchi either . I spent a few more years wandering in various places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's train journey from Moscow . I would slip into the city from time to time without a permit  --  every trip a celebration and an exhilarating adven-ture  --  and from these trips , and especially from the inspiration I received from them , I learned that I was not molded from the clay of those who are capable of escaping from themselves to an enchanted lake in the heart of the country . I belong in the metropolis , where your anonymity is reflected back to you from the suspicious eyes of millions of strangers passing you by in p 105 absolute indifference to your existence . I would have no peace of mind until I was sitting in a smoke-filled room , among comrades and informers , debating the theory which would lead us to a new , more successful experiment that would guarantee us our daily bread in happiness and dignity without pain and electricity , without losing our human image . In 1921 I went by foot from Migdal to Beitanya . People said that there was a group of peculiar , upper-class pioneers there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our boys had stolen there one night to eavesdrop on their debates . They came back splitting their sides with laughter . The things they said ! The soul-searching ! They behaved as if they were conducting direct negotiations with Almighty God . My curiosity was aroused . Spring was running riot in the fields and I made my way through thorns taller than a man . I had a keffiyeh on my head and a dagger in my belt . There was a couple sitting on a rock , outside the camp , and when they saw me they were overcome with terror . I felt sorry for the boy , who looked as if he had seen a ghost and picked up a stone in his trembling hand . " A friend ! " I called . The way their faces lit up ! The girl was pretty and delicate . Her Hebrew was poor . The boy was indeed highly educated and full of fashionable ideas . There was n't a book which had been popular with the younger generation over the past decade that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . Later we were joined by others . I spoke about the class struggle , they of the salvation of the soul . I spoke about the Arab question , they about Western civilization . A dialogue of the deaf . I was touched by their enlightened , intellectual poses . I was a year or two older than them , and to myself I seemed as old as the hills . They were a kindhearted crew and believed in all innocence that it would be possible for Jews to settle the land without any opposition from the Arabs . Their weakness was their charm . Who would want to hurt such nice people ? They were incapable of harming a fly . Later on we became allies for a time . I was always astonished  | by their faith in their ability to establish a little kingdom of righteousness on two hundred dunams of irrigated land and one thousand dunams of unirrigated land . And in Russia I was amazed to hear that they of all people had established a Marxist party in Eretz Israel . The ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me , were very successful and well organized . " But if you ask me , all the kibbutzim are the same , however much they differ . " He himself had not been born on a kibbutz , he told me . He was a youth-movement graduate from Tel Aviv . He had joined the kibbutz after serving in the Jewish Brigade during the war . For his wife 's sake . He was well aware of all the imperfections of the kibbutz . And nevertheless he had chosen to live there . It was preferable to any other way of life he knew . He told me about his childhood in Tel Aviv . A happy childhood . He had n't even known that his parents were poor . He spoke of them fondly . Modest , simple , bookish people . His mother worked in the Histadrut Sick Fund dispensary and read a lot of scientific articles . Every time she read a new one she would change the family diet . One month they lived on raw vegetables , the next month boiled , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , in the dues collection department . From time to time he wrote an article for the Young Worker : " Are We Living in Sodom ? " " Are Things Really as Bad as They Seem ? " " On the Question of Jewish Labor . " " Further Reflections on the Problem of the New Immigrants . " Bashan was the name he had taken when he was sent on a movement mission abroad , he said . The family name was originally Besskind . There was no connection . Bashan was the name of a cheese . And a border area in biblical times . He had always dreamed of settling on the frontier . As far as possible from the center of the country . " You lived on Ben Zakkai Street in Tel Aviv . A two-story house with a garden . On the first floor . The side entrance , " I said . He was astounded . Overcome with confusion . " You knew my parents ? "  | " A little . " " And you remember the address , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory , " he exclaimed in admiration . " You can never know why your mind chooses to preserve certain details , facts , numbers . Sometimes it seems like a rubbish heap . A storeroom of information that nobody needs . I remember other insignificant details too : a garden , a mulberry tree , a washing line , an ironing board on the back porch . And more : a child 's shirt . White , flapping sleeves . One cuff buttoned , the other loose , " I added to amaze him . " Incredible . " " Sometimes I strain every fiber of my being to recall some important detail  --  and I ca n't . " " But you remember things as if you were a frequent visitor . " " Not exactly . I met your father once . And I only caught a glimpse of your mother . She was standing and ironing . I asked her if your father was home and she said Yes , ' and that was all . " " It 's hard to believe . " " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were still a baby crying in the bedroom .

" " It 's a fact . " " You 're sure it was only once ? " " Absolutely . But it 's a small world , and you never know in what circumstances you 'll meet again . " An association from another compartment of my memory . Words said by a prisoner to his interrogator , meant as a threat . And they did meet again , a few years later , in Kolyma . And the prisoner took his revenge . Baruch Bashan refused to believe that I could n't remember the reason why I came to his parents ' house . And he was right . It was only a little white lie . Perhaps if I 'd known him longer I would n't have minded telling him the truth . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But  | under the cover , as it were , of a movement for promoting friendship between Arabs and Jews . We came to induce him to do what he was unwilling to do . The Executive Committee of the Histadrut , the Jewish Labor Federation , had decided to expel the members of the Communist Fraktzia . We were fighting for our lives . Not only were we about to lose our means of livelihood but we were also facing the threat of deportation . The British authorities used the Histadrut expulsions as a means of identifying Communists , whom they subsequently deported from the country . We could n't hold protest demonstrations . We were more or less underground . A public meeting could endanger our very existence . We decided to bring out a petition and get signatures from people outside our ranks . Public figures , intellectuals , writers , poets , and ordinary people who had earned themselves a reputation for fair-mindedness in the narrow circles of the Jewish Yishuv . The task of getting signatures on the petition was far from easy . Many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were afraid of exposing themselves to the public eye because they did n't have papers . Some hated us passionately and they could n't have cared less if we were deported . After all , the gates of the Soviet " Paradise " were open to us . It was n't my idea to go to Besskind , a member of Hapoel Hatzair , an unassuming , upright worker in the dues department of the Histadrut , whom no one could possibly suspect of being a Communist and whose articles were always full of the sayings of the sages . It took someone shrewder than me to think of him . Efros was the " Talmudist " among us . He was the one who could pay back our religious opponents in their own coin . He was endowed with the quality which sets a leader apart from the rank and file . He was quick to note another man 's weaknesses and he never hesitated to exploit them . Although he had never set eyes on Besskind in his life , he had read his articles . He judged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral pressure . A man as passionately committed to liberal ideas as Besskind p 109 should fight for the right of others to disagree with his opinions . My weaknesses too were well known to Efros . Which ones ? Empty arrogance , conceit , the pose of a professional revolutionary . He let me talk first , and I felt the sweat pouring down my neck . I took a liking to Besskind from the moment I set eyes on him . He stood in his little room surrounded by books  --  in the cupboards , on the table , on the bed , the floor  --  and looked at us from behind his thick glasses with a stricken expression . He seemed to guess who we were and sense that he would not be able to send us away empty-handed . We had seized him by his principles like a cat by the nape of its neck . I wanted to run away . I remembered the woman ironing on the porch , I thought about their happiness , the baby crying in the other room , the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed that Bess-kind 's signature on our petition would upset the tranquility of this cozy little nest . I said to myself that I was presumably not made of the stuff of a true revolutionary . Besskind behaved exactly as Efros had assumed he would . He said that everything we did and said and stood for was wrong in his eyes and that Russia was the Kingdom of Evil and the Communists in Eretz Israel were cutting off the branch they were sitting on with their own hands , but that he would sign the petition nevertheless . Since it was unthinkable to allow a foreign power to deport Jews from Eretz Israel . I was sorry that he found it necessary to actually repeat the classic liberal phrase ? " I 'll fight for your right to express our opinions however much I disagree with them " ? and thereby play into Efros 's hands and give him a chance to congratulate himself on the acuteness of his own perceptions . I was right to be concerned about what would happen to Besskind . For things turned out exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outcry and the workers ' papers denounced the signatories on the petition . Besskind defended his action , and was brutally attacked  --  with insinuations about as subtle as a sledgehammer . One day he was arrested and ques-  | tioned by the police and later released . Perhaps the episode left a mark on his life forever . I was sorry for him . I thought we had done him a wrong . Our petition did n't change anything . Perhaps it brought a few of the people who had signed it closer to our camp . Perhaps they said to themselves : If liberals are n't tolerant either , what advantage have they got over radicals ? In any case , Besskind lost on all counts . The Poel Hatzair stopped publishing his articles . Only a letter to the editor in Davar appeared from time to time . A voice crying in the wilderness . He acquired a reputation for being a fool and a bleeding heart . One day I talked to Efros about it . I said that I regretted what we had done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without doing ourselves any good . Efros was furious . " What did we do to him ? Did anyone harm a hair on his head ? Poor Arab peasants are evicted from their land and nobody sheds a tear . The world wo n't come to an end if Besskind 's idiotic articles do n't appear in print . You and I have made greater sacrifices for the revolution . Rest assured that Besskind is n't bemoaning your fate . On the contrary : with the help of Besskind we exposed the true faces of his hypocritical , self-righteous friends . As long as you agree with them everything 's fine . But look out if you dare to have an opinion of your own ! " Then he patted my shoulder . " You 've still got a lot to learn , my lad . " On the way Baruch Bashan pointed out Nimrod 's kibbutz , a settlement climbing up a gently sloping hill so drowned in greenery you could hardly see the houses . Far from the road , isolated , keeping all its goodness to itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed more welcoming if Nimrod was at home . But I had a certain feeling of belonging anyway . As if I had a house there , only it was hidden by the trees . " And those fields , the fish ponds , the citrus groves  --  that 's Tel Yosef. " p 111 In the first year I did n't miss anything , except for the snow . And when I say " snow " I see a picture . A child of seven or eight standing next to the fence of his house on the outskirts of the little town and looking out . In front of him an expanse of spotless snow . Untouched . At the edge of the picture  --  a few bare trees standing like signposts next to a bluish forest , and the edge of a village . A thin column of smoke rising into the air and dissolving into the white sky . A strong wind whirls the snowflakes around the laden branches of the firs . On the border of the forest , in the distance , a sleigh drawn by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappears into the mist rising from the valley . My mother calls but I do n't hear her voice . As if I had been granted a revelation . But I do n't know what it was that was revealed . Looking back : the borders of my world . Perhaps a bitter lesson : my motherland , however miserable I was in it . A man is the mold of the landscape of his motherland . Wherever I go I shall take that picture , that yearning , with me . Whenever I remember it , I imagine I can hear the sound of a soft bell and the crackle of the ice breaking under the sleigh and the horses ' hooves . The first meeting with the Jezreel Valley ? " Nuris block " we called it then  --  was stunning . It was summer , everything was parched and dry , the earth was cracked , sparse bushes spread a sickly yellow over the roadside , and an ominous whisper passed through the standing grain , like the despairing sigh of ten thousand insects . The stalks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mice had left ugly , pale-brown , bald patches , and the barley drooped broken-headed . And the few thorn trees were swarming with wasps , depriving the weary wayfarer of the bit of shade he longed for . I dragged my legs , swooning with thirst and fatigue , unable to comprehend why our comrades should fight for this piece of land . The winter was no less discouraging . We trudged through  | the mud and shivered with cold in our tattered tents , exposed to every wind . It was a filthy winter , our boots crowned with layer upon layer of curly mud . Heavy rains whipping through the tents splashed mud onto our coarse woolen blankets . And there was no hope of a little wintry consolation : to get up in the morning and see the whole world covered with pure white snow . White and silent from horizon to horizon with a glory not of this world . I left Tel Yosef on a rainy day in the winter of ' 27 intending never to return . I stood at the railway station determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few months later , but that was at night . And I never saw anything except for a few lights twinkling and trees looming suddenly out of the dark . If I had been caught , I would have been thrown out in disgrace . They might even have beaten me up . We never lacked for hotheads . I spent four years in Nuris block  --  a base from which I would depart to perform the historical tasks of my generation , and to which I would return . Those years left their mark on my life forever . Whatever came afterward was measured in their terms . Nothing remained of what I remembered . Only the contours of the road , the railway tracks , a little wood at the bottom of Mount Gilboa , and the skyline . But even that was broken here and there . There were a few houses on the summit of the mountain on the east . And the village of Mazar had been wiped off the face of the earth . On the summit of the mountain , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky , there was nothing now but a few solitary trees . Even the southern slope of the mountain had changed beyond recognition . A forest of trees . As if they had taken it upon themselves to prove that the return to Zion had lifted the biblical curse . The kibbutz itself belonged completely to here and now . To discover my traces here I would apparently have to dig up concrete and asphalt . Not a single tree for my memories to attach themselves to . Never mind a building . Only Vera belonged to the past . I do n't know if she walked p 113 past the parking lot the moment we arrived by chance or if she had been waiting for us there for hours . If she had changed as little as the expression on her face  --  a mute appeal : " Tell the truth , but try not to hurt " ? she was capable of it . I would have known her even if I met her in the street , among strangers , far from home . Women who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect time of betraying them with their younger sisters . Vera was highly excited and bustled about without stopping . She seized my bag and ran into her room and ran out again to thank Baruch Bashan . She kept up a steady stream of chatter interspersed with promises to herself and me that we would talk properly later . When we finally stood facing each other in the room I was led almost by force to the bathroom " to wash my face and hands . " On the assumption , evidently , that a man of my age would have to answer the call of nature after a three-hour drive . I came out of the bathroom with my hands wet and asked her to take the towel I had brought with me out of my bag . Vera was indignant : " I would n't be surprised if you 've brought sheets and cans of food too ! " Had I really forgotten what a kibbutz meant ? We almost had a quarrel over this nonsense and Vera leaped into the bathroom and fetched two towels and thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me misplaced . " Why should n't I use my own towel ? " I said . " It 's a shame to send a towel that 's only been used once or twice to the laundry . " Vera explained that the kibbutz laundry was no longer done in cauldrons heated over coals . Then she held forth at length about the marvels of their new " automatic " or " electronic " laundry . She was as proud as a Komsomol member showing a tourist from abroad a Soviet factory . In this too Vera had not changed . She had always been blessed with a mighty will to be happy and gay , but she had never had a sense of humor . Perhaps this was one of the signs of the times or perhaps it was something inherent in her own personality . Idealists are afraid of frivolity and ugly women only feel comfortable in the presence of serious men . Afterward we had tea and cake and spoke about everything  | under the sun except for what it was really important for us to know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only thing I really wanted to ask about was my son , but I chose not to in order to avoid striking a note of intimacy . And she perhaps shrank from speaking of anything serious because I was trying too hard to be clever . I expect that she too said to herself that I had not changed . I was still the same enigmatic boy , throwing out ambivalent remarks in order to demonstrate my intellectual superiority . Which was the accusation she had leveled at me before we parted . In the early evening we went out for a walk in the kibbutz grounds . I tried to identify the place where my tent had been pitched . But the gentle contour of the hill seemed to have been flattened by bulldozers . We walked along a pretty avenue of palms leading from the center of the old yard to the hill of Kumi and looked at the valley : the old Tel Yosef , Heftziba , and Beit Alfa , and the overpowering wall of the Gilboa  --  the sight I used to see every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening of my tent with my oiled boots in my hand . In the old Nuris block , white houses were scattered over the shoulder of the mountain . The quarry , it seemed , had not widened its wound . Somewhere up there , during the pageant we put on at Passover , parodying the traditional sources as befitting a band of heretics , I once hid among the rocks to speak the word of God in a rolling bass voice thundering across the valley . The peace of mind I felt at the sight of the tranquil green valley was somewhat disrupted when Vera informed me in a would-be casual tone of voice that she had invited a number of friends to drop in after supper . They would be expecting me to say a few words . What did they expect me to do ? Beat my breast and beg them to forgive me ? And how could I refuse ? She had given her promise and how could I let her down ?

She had lost a lot of weight over the years but she was still as dumpy as ever , and when she bustled about on her thin little legs , her enormous bosom taking up half her body , it was impossible not to be reminded of the cruelly apt nickname given her by one of the Crimeans who had settled at Migdal . He called her " Beetle , " and since it suited her the name stuck . " If all a man wants is to settle down , " he said , " at least he 'll be well padded .

By the way , the desire to settle down was n't considered anything to be proud of either . Vera avoided looking into my eyes , she kept getting up and sitting down again for no reason , filling my plate with cookies , straightening pictures on the wall , and looking for things to do so that she could skip from one subject to another and direct our conversation into byways lacking in any significance .

She did n't spare her  | rebukes , although she never preached or moralized . She always spoke with profound pain . As if she was mourning the decline in values , or coming to the defense of an orphan child . Now there was a gentle , cautious note in her voice .

I have always felt that I could learn something about a person from looking into his room , even rooms that contain almost nothing . There was n't much furniture . A couch , two armchairs , a table , chairs , a bookcase , and a cabinet with the radio and television on it  --  all in a rustic style . It was all quite austere but for the many handmade cushions and colorful rag dolls ( it was of these objects that we mainly spoke : how she made them and from what materials and how much work she put into each and every one of the decorative articles she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ? exquisite handiwork into which she wove the loneliness increasingly closing in on her . Challenges demanding patience and distracting her from superfluous thoughts , scraps of material and bits of wool , things into which she could pour her need to organize things and keep them clean and tidy . During all these years , it seemed , she had not become a prey to greed or envy or acquisitiveness . Only a longing for color seemed to have awakened in her with old age . But perhaps it was not her own taste but simply poverty which had dictated her penchant for the browns and whites and grays of former years . p 117 The word " acquisitiveness " rose to the surface of my memory at the moment when I would have been most happy to have forgotten it . After that first night she came and sat down beside me in the dining room . She did n't speak to me or drop any hints , but her face was radiant with a quiet happiness . She put the spoon into her mouth but her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mysterious point somewhere on the ceiling of the hut , as if she was reliving the night before minute by minute . I could n't stand this complacency . Did n't she know how to distinguish between hunger and love ? And did we have to announce our feelings in public ? The next day I went to Kibbutz Ramat Rachel . I stayed with the Jerusalem " company " for a month . ( On duty . Ostensibly to instruct them in stonecutting but actually , in self-defense : I taught the young men to shoot a revolver . ) Afterward I fell ill with malaria and spent some time in Hebron , in the haunted house . There too I had a short , insignificant affair . Women appear to possess a highly developed sense of smell : the minute one of them falls in love with you it immediately arouses the curiosity of her sisters . After that I went to the Histadrut council , and from there to Kfar Giladi . There too on Haganah business . I got back to Tel Yosef after three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried , full of anger against myself . Miriam , a beautiful girl for whom I had felt tremendous respect and also presumably a secret love , without ever allowing myself to approach her , had responded to the advances of one of the other boys , a fellow who in my opinion was not worthy of her in any respect . I bumped into Vera by accident . I had no intention at all of seeking her out . She dragged me to the kitchen , made me something to eat , and then took me by the hand and led me to the same place as before on the edge of the olive grove . Nothing was said . I was full of pity for myself and for the sad treats she showered on me , and she , again , was overjoyed . When she came to my tent early in the evening I asked her not to come again . She was insulted : " Are you ashamed of me ? "  | And it was then that I spoke to her so harshly . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anyone could call what was between us love . I did n't want her to think that because of one or two nights she had some kind of claim on me . And I did n't want her coming to sit next to me in the dining room full of the pride of possession , as if I belonged to her or something . She did n't deserve it . The lust for possessions , which we all scorned , was never one of her failings . She had n't come from Russia as a penniless refugee . Her parents were well off and they had succeeded in smuggling a large part of their fortune into Germany . She had an aunt with means in Petah Tikva and a cousin in the Anglo-Palestine Bank . If she had been acquisitive , she would n't have shared our property with us . In other words , the things I said to her were not only insulting but also unfair . The walk through the kibbutz grounds was full of symbols . Some of them she did n't shrink from naming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall trees , the well-tended lawns , the neat , attractive houses , the healthy children playing with their parents  --  the life of a Jewish village where " four generations of Jews live in the shade of the same tree , " as Efrati said to me afterward . The evening of a full life , continuing from generation to generation . We walked through the grounds like a sad triumphal procession : they were right and I was wrong . Every now and then she permitted herself to correct my Hebrew . A simple symbol : my rootlessness , her rootedness . The tired tread of our feet was loaded with meanings . But only the members of my generation could have understood that sentimental jounrney : in their eyes I was not a visitor but a prodigal son , returning penitent to the fold . All the youngsters we encountered on our walk probably saw was an elderly couple taking the evening air . A little ridiculous and perhaps a little irritating , too , as if they did n't have a mirror in their room and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went for a long walk . I saw the dining hall , the cultural club , the children 's houses , the playgrounds , the Sturman Mu-  | seum , and the musical education workshop . We looked over at Ein Harod , too . The harsh rivalry of the old days was now a thing of the past . I was n't surprised to hear that there were two Ein Harods now , one on the right and one on the left . I had forseen it in ' 27 . The big , open kibbutz , a kibbutz for every Tom , Dick , and Harry , was a utopia , just like the " general commune of the workers of Eretz Israel . " " People who hate each other 's dreams with all their hearts ca n't be expected to eat from the same dish , " I argued then . " Mutual suspicions will corrode every achievement . Scarcity can be shared and shared alike , but you ca n't impose your debts on a man who has no desire to mortgage his dreams of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to burden himself with a few parasites who do n't contribute anything to the common good , on condition that they not cast stones into the well they drink from . But if they pray from a different prayerbook , he 'll demand one of two things : either work hard or get out . " My foot , which was suffering from a mysterious infection , hurt a little , but I went on walking in order not to disappoint Vera . There was still a lot I had to see : a big workshop which they called a factory , Joseph Trumpeldor House , agricultural machinery . And I wanted to linger in the metal workshop  --  a rather messy area which Vera wanted to hurry past . There , in the piles of junk , I came across a few old acquaintances : a rusty plow , an old harrow , and a wooden wheel with iron spokes ( I caught a glimpse of another wheel close to my heart in the shape of the battered remnants of an old enamel basin in the garden of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the old familiar landscape was covered with lawns , roads , concrete paths . Somewhere here , I thought , under these lawns and concrete surfaces , a few remembered objects must be buried : rusty nails , wire , enamel dishes with blue rims , aluminum mugs with narrow chains attached to them ( even in the days of utter trust , before we fell out on the question of the world revolution , the aluminum mugs were firmly attached to the wooden lid of the coldwater jug with chains ) . A funny thought occurred to me : my eyes  | were busy with the work of demolition . Probing under the buildings and roads to dig up junk . Vera 's eyes were calm and shining . I knew what she was thinking and some of it she said aloud : " We 've built a model farm here . There were hard times and bitter disappointments . But in recent years there 's been a terrific push forward . And we have our children and grandchildren with us here . Not mine and yours , specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the younger generation are on the kibbutz , following in my footsteps , not yours . In other words , our labors have been rewarded . Everything we sacrificed on the altar of national revival and intensive farming was not in vain . We sowed our seeds and had faith in the future . " Other thoughts were racing through my brain . How long would it take for a unit of tanks to turn this place into a pile of rubble ? We walked for a while in the fields to the east . The road , it seemed , was the same one along which I had returned in the evenings with the sheep in the old days . Only the color was different . A dirt road churned up by tractor wheels and trucks and cars does not resemble a dirt road churned up by hooves . So many years had passed and yet I still remembered that grayish shade which as far as I was concerned was always the color of Eretz Israel . During the Second World War , when I was serving in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke not of the revolution but of the motherland . And I remembered then the few years during which I had called Eretz Israel my motherland . Abstract words need simple pictures to make them real . The picture that appeared in my mind was this : a young man with a mustache waxed with butter into points , wearing a voluminous abaya and a striped tunic in black and white , his arms hanging carelessly over the shepherd 's staff lying across his shoulders , walking in front of the sheep kicking up a cloud of white dust . That boy was me . Of all the roles I played in my life  --  those who never dream p 121 dreams or try to realize them probably succeed in being themselves all their lives long , but dreamers play the many parts they envisage in their dreams  --  this one was the best : the role of a young man in love with the loneliness of a shepherd , delighting in his filth and trying to make noises like a Bedouin , full of the belief that by walking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with nature and the landscape and the sheep and the flies , a god to a few dozen goats and sheep and one sheepdog . It was a peculiar combination of cossack and nomad . When I came back to the camp in the evening I was the happiest man in the world . With what modest pride I would enter the big tent and join my washed and combed companions with the oil lamp casting a pale light on my clothes as floury as a baker 's with the white dust , ready to modestly accept their admiration . You have to remember : taking the sheep out to graze involved real danger then . In those days the men who worked in the fields did not look down on the shepherds and nobody said that only confirmed loafers and idlers born and bred would be capable of spending hours every day in the company of dumb animals . I was faithful to that role for a long time . I even abstained from reading during working hours . I wanted to be a real shepherd and nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . In the end I could no longer restrain myself and I asked about Nimrod . A question without real substance . For what could she say ? What did I actually want to know ? What kind of a man he was ? What did he have in him of me ? But I was afraid that if I did n't ask she would be hurt . As if I took no interest in my offspring . What 's more , she would be reinforced in all her prejudices about me : that I was a heartless , unfeeling man . A cripple . A lost soul . A link without a chain . A puff of smoke . A man without a father and without a son . I know that this is what she thought , although she never wrote it to me . From a distance of thousands of miles I guessed  | her thoughts . Even after the connection was broken and the letters stopped coming , I knew what she felt . Many people might think it strange . Although I had abandoned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grudge . At any event , not openly . She clung to the belief that I had been thrown out and had not left of my own free will . Which is both correct and incorrect . And when I went to Russia , she shared the responsibility for the separation with me . She would never have returned to Russia . Perhaps she said to herself that if I had called for her to come and live with me in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem she might have renounced one lofty ideal and gone to succor the man she loved . An honorable compromise at which even the most orthodox of the movement disciples would have winked an eye . But in returning to the Diaspora I betrayed a principle which was more important to her than the family itself . This was how she saw things . In the saga of her life , I was cast in the role of a lost soul . On no account did she see me as an unprincipled scoundrel exploiting the innocence of a woman hungry for life and then running away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sad body . We corresponded for a few years . The letters to Via Nova were full of facts about the child . His weight , his health , his cute tricks . About herself she wrote nothing . Nor about the comrades and the farm . As if she had set herself a limit : the rights of a father were still valid but the rights of a comrade had been forfeited . In her letters to Moscow there was a suppressed note of rebuke . Why had n't I written and told her that I 'd married ? What was it , a secret ? And then the comrades suddenly appeared : " Everyone wishes you happiness and good luck . " I felt that up to then she had still hoped that I would come back , for the sake of the child . After her hopes had been dashed , a note of bitterness crept into her letters . She hoped that my wife would enjoy what she had not enjoyed : love , loyalty . Once she even shot an overt barb in my direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a worker . In that at least I had been serious . And now in  | Russia of all places , the motherland of the workers and peasants , I was abandoning labor and going to work in an office . I sent her a reply which in my opinion was irrefutable : the Soviet Union is a classless society and therefore it makes no difference what work a man does , over here the engineer is a worker too , and without his contribution society could not exist . Vera was not without weaknesses . Sometimes she took her revenge on me in touching ways . One day she wrote that Nimrod had caught pneumonia . Afterward she wrote again and made no mention of the illness . I dashed off an urgent note : How is the boy ? And then she replied , If you really cared about the child you would come to see what he looks like , at least . I replied : How can I ? The British Intelligence have a file on me : if I come they 'll arrest me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yosef . And the comrades , I asked , will they all be so glad to see me ? Her answer was long and apologetic ; she asked me to forgive her for losing control of herself . Vera said that Nimrod was a serious person . Baruch Bashan had said the same . She added only , " You 'll get to know him and see for yourself . " Her blue eyes , which looked as if a whitish liquid had been poured into them , suddenly cleared and she said , " I ca n't wait for you to meet each other . " " I 'd prefer the first meeting to be in private , " I said . She made a slight movement with her shoulders and then she said it in words : " Better not . You 'll both swallow your tongues if we leave you alone . Better for me to be there at first , and after things warm up you can go on by yourselves . " Vera really had n't changed . It will be remembered that I kept my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's hard to explain . Obviously , I was n't afraid she would suspect me of being in love with a woman in another country . And I did n't tell her about Nimrod either . But it was n't the fear of hurting her that motivated me.  | You have to understand the atmosphere of those days . Those of us who went back to Russia were convinced that emigrating to Eretz Israel in the first place was wrong , and we tried to correct our mistake by rubbing it out . Like crossing out an unnecessary word . It was n't hard to erect a barrier between the present and the past . It was plain that the hostility was increasing . You did n't have to be a political genius to realize that the wall between Russia and Eretz Israel was going to grow higher . Here a new world was being created  --  and over there they were the agents of imperialism . Any common fate between them and us was out of the question . Nina was a frail , refined woman and in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pain , anger , or perplexity . I did not approach things from the point of view of true or false . The dialectics we believed in gave me the tools to paint my behavior in rosy colors . I believed that I was protecting Nina when I tore years of trial and error out of my life like pages out of a book . The past was dead and the life ahead of me belonged to me and to Nina exclusively . Vera and her son had nothing to do with Nina 's life . I could find no fault in keeping her ignorant of their existence . When Nina found out about Nimrod her anger astonished me . How could this fact cast a shadow on our happiness ? And when we made our peace she said that the thing which had shocked her was the fact that I had lied to her . " I did n't lie , " I put the record straight . " All I did was to keep certain facts that had no bearing on your life from you . What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no way back . And the child who was born from that unfortunate episode will have a life of his own , without any connection to the man who fathered him . " An orphan of the period , I said to someone else , at a different time . The First World War had filled the world with orphans . One heard the most appalling stories . Even in my own family terrible things had happened . The case of a boy in Eretz Israel who had been parted from his father as a result of circumstances p 125 did not seem to me something about which it was legitimate to be shocked . But in Nina 's eyes the marriage union was an irrevocable vow in which the partners undertook never to conceal anything from each other . Not even the slightest fluctuations of feeling . She even demanded that I describe my childhood and youth to her without leaving anything out , as if I was betraying her with every picture that escaped my memory . I hated it . It did not diminish my love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this passion for intimate soul searching . There are anxieties in a man 's heart which he should not reveal even to his wife . A passing sigh is inflated to huge proportions the moment you have to explain the reasons for it . And she wanted to know everything . What was happening inside my mind . And every word which tried to describe some faint , subtle feeling only succeeded in turning it into a monster . On a number of occasions she gave me gratuitous pain when she found it necessary , faithful to her vows , to tell me things that no woman should say to her husband . Momentary weaknesses which would have been better passed over in silence and forgotten . Did we ever receive a promise from our bodies that they would never betray us ? But she was not a woman to feel something and keep it to herself . She had a theory , too , which she had picked up somewhere : things which are born in our brains and never see the light of day are like stillborn babies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nina too learned to keep some things to herself . Vera 's letter was never mentioned again and she never asked about Nimrod . Shortly afterward the correspondence came to an end anyway , as a result of circumstances beyond our control . And not long after that I was arrested . And the few letters we wrote to each other after that concealed more than they revealed . The affair was only spoken about once again . In 1942 , as I have already mentioned , I was permitted to volunteer for the Red Army . Although I was already profoundly disillusioned by then , I believed that the war against Germany would cleanse Russia of its ills . People who had mistreated their  | fellows so shockingly-the old Party members , the kulaks , the national minorities , the Jews , the deviationists , the vast numbers who were slaughtered on political battlefields without knowing how or why  --  would not be able to revert to their evil ways when they saw how the people they had let down so badly were prepared to sacrifice themselves for the motherland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped in Moscow for four hours . I arrived at the house and Nina was n't there . I ran like a madman to the dental clinic where she was doing her apprenticeship . They let her go out with me for two hours . I wanted to go to bed with her there and then , on the laboratory floor , but she rushed me to the creche to see Olga . Olga was not in the least affected to see me and took no notice of me at all . I was driven wild by the thought of the poison they must be dripping into her mind : enemy of the people , traitor . I resigned myself to my fate and only regretted having come to see her without having prepared her in advance . But when we tried to say goodbye to her she would n't let us go . She complained of imaginary pains and cried hysterically . We had two versions of why she did it . Nina said that Olga did n't want to part from me . I thought things were simpler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was afraid of entrusting her mother to my hands . She was already old enough to understand why I was so keen to get her mother away from there . I was impatient and angry . Nina thought that a quick , frustrating union of the kind which united us for a moment , standing up , covered by my soldier 's overcoat , behind a public lavatory , was not worth the harm done to the child ( faithful to her marriage vows , as usual , she was completely truthful and told me right there , whispering into my sweating neck , that it gave her no pleasure at all , only pain ) . Then an ugly quarrel broke out . Nina said that I was a hard-hearted man without paternal feelings . And she reminded me of the letter from Vera . This time she offered another version . It was not my lie that bothered her . She was shocked by my indifference to the child 's illness .  | She said it with her body too : her pale face , her heaving bosom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end we made up . We cried like children , and she was sorry for what she had said . But what could she do  --  that was what she had felt at the moment she had said it . When the train moved out of the station I was upset and angry . I was going to be killed , I said to myself , and my daughter would be an orphan . And her mother would not have to be ashamed of the hard-hearted father and enemy of the people anymore . She would be able to be proud of the fallen soldier . In the evening the meeting took place . At first Vera had intended holding it in her room , but so many people expressed the wish to take part that in the end they transferred it to the kibbutz " club . " An institution unfamiliar to me . In my day all members ' meetings took place in the dining room  --  a big tent from British Army surplus supplies , which was the living heart of the kibbutz during almost all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kind of cafe where people met to read newspapers and pass the time of day . In the days of poverty the big frying pan in the kitchen served the same purpose . The night owls would gather around it , wipe up the dregs of the oil with thick slabs of bread , and gossip to their hearts ' content . I was not all keen to make a speech in front of an audience . There was an abyss yawning between me and the kibbutz members , and it could not be bridged by words . And how much the more so in a language I was not fluent in . They suggested that I speak in Russian but I refused . I preferred stammering in Hebrew . Furthermore , if I spoke in Russian only the members of my own generation would come and I would feel like a Party member forced to criticize himself at a cell meeting . In any case , since I had already , in a moment of weakness , agreed , I could not go back on my word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were  | stooped , and only his mane of white hair  --  the hair of a poet , even though to his mind poetry distracted people from seeing things clearly and simply  --  was as heavy as ever . As if the snows of his youth had come to crown his head in his old age . His opening remarks , full of witticisms , were astonishingly similar to the kinds of speeches I had heard him make forty-five years before . He remembered that our last meeting had taken place in the isolation ward in the Beit Alfa hospital , when I was ill with a bad bout of malaria . This memory gave him a good excuse to jump straight into our own times . The metamorphosis of a word : in the Soviet Union the " isolation " wing was the wing reserved for political prisoners in the jails . I was obliged to agree with a nod of my head , for everyone looked at me inquiringly . Unintentionally an atmosphere of confrontation had been created . It became clear that I was going to be required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right ? Who was wrong ? Who was at the gates of Hell ? And who at the gates of Heaven ? Let there be no mistake : there was no rudeness , no insistent demands or sarcastic questions . On the contrary , Efrati was very polite and tried not to give offense to a visitor . But the expectation in the eyes of his audience was stronger than the rebuke in the eyes of a frowning cell secretary . They had good reason to feel hatred and anger . Soviet arms were threatening their sons and grandsons . They did not pour their wrath out on my head . They simply waited for poetic justice to be done . I had been asked to speak about the Soviet Union , but my head was spinning with thoughts of another time . The days of the Labor Brigade had come back to life in me . The bald heads gleaming in front of me sprouted mops of boyish curls and time took a great leap backward . What I had previously tried to forget , I now tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on parting ? " Subjectively each of you is a poor laborer , but objectively you are the servants of the bourgeoisie  --  poverty excuses nothing . Every bloated capitalist has a flunky to sweep the dirt off the floor in front of him . " p 129 * * * I was not a skeptic . On the contrary . I tried to cling to certainties . I was prepared to entrust my soul to anyone who promised me a codex of laws , a secular Talmud . How happy I would have been if it had been granted me to abandon my body to the current flowing down to the great sea . I would have been willing to follow anyone who gave me a guarantee that from now on not a single moment of my life would be wasted . That all my acts added up . Even a soccer game was not an empty amusement . It gave me a healthy mind in a healthy body . Every drop of sweat poured oil onto the great bonfire . The idea of the Labor Brigade captivated me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jewish monk , faithful to the general commune of workers in Eretz Israel , a soldier in the army of labor , ready to be sent wherever he was needed . The conquest of labor was no empty phrase to me . And it meant not only conquering the labor market for the Jewish worker but also conquering ourselves for labor . Although I did not suffer from physical weakness , I found the work exhausting . For a long time I tormented myself with the question : Was my escape to the sheep as blameless as it seemed ? Perhaps I found it so idyllic because I was actually bone-idle ? And when we were building the road I had tried to get myself attached to the cart drivers who received a daily wage , rather than the stone breakers who were paid according to the amount of work they did . I punished myself for this backsliding , and when the foreman discovered that I had a talent for organization and put me in charge of a section of the road , I sentenced myself to hard labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Labor Brigade was a good place to sow one 's wild oats . A tumbledown , wide-open house where everyone was welcome . A home for a young man trying to put off deciding who and what he was , who did not want to settle down yet in a home of his own . Any loafer or ne'er-do-well could join for a time , live like a parasite , learn a trade , and take off at the first opportunity that offered . How we scorned those who went  | to Tel Aviv and built themselves a hut and bought themselves a table and chair and candles for the Sabbath . The mother party , Ahdut haAvodah , did not get off scot-free either . Worrying about the needs of town dwellers , occasional workers with petit bourgeois souls ! Imagining that it would build a political force on their shoulders ! The commotion , the disorder , the anarchy  --  all these were to my liking . I did n't join the party . In the elections for the Histadrut convention I voted for the left-wing list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for a political party . An enthusiastic mass movement had no need of steering committees and secretariats . The faithful would carry the slowpokes along with them . The wise would teach the foolish . The conscientious would shame the scoundrels . In the language of those days  --  a workers ' economy would be more successful and cheaper even in the present system . I was one of the faithful . I volunteered for every hard job . I chastised the wastrels . I gave back every penny not spent on fares to the common kitty . I was a soldier in the Jewish revolution . Sentenced to hard labor for life to atone for the sins of the shopkeepers and peddlers . Content that the sweat and dust had peeled the skin of the Diaspora from my body and soul . Even malaria was a welcome guest , an emissary from the Messiah . I submitted myself to loving the dry earth , the flies , the snakes , everything that was part and parcel of the nature of the place . Suffering purifies , as everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pouch . Only by renouncing himself and his freedom can a man make himself free . " Only what I have lost is mine forever . " An end to splashing in the shallow waters of some imaginary weltschmertz , I harangued myself soundlessly in moments of gloom and low spirits . The iron discipline of the commune is the definitive answer to the Jewish fate . I was even able to overcome the boredom . I forgave the licentious their license and the cursers their foul language . The empty-headed braggarts who boasted of their lack of culture were heroes in my eyes if only they knew how to hit a nail on the  | head with a hammer . At night I too was swept into the hysteria of the dancing , which kept doubt at bay for a few hours . Disillusionment is not something which is visited on you like a sudden eclipse of the sun . It is more like candles going out one by one . I was personally offended by the deficit of the first year . How could it be possible ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was it possible that the commune could not compete with the private economy ? Was the idea false ? Or were the comrades themselves to blame ? Or perhaps there was no hope for the commune except when it was the ally of the regime ? The comrades were indeed a disappointment . First of all ? the loafers , who did not understand the full weight of the responsibility that had fallen to their lot : to show the world that the sense of comradeship was a greater spur to effort than the acquisitive instinct . Then the scoundrels , the exploiters who came to learn a trade for nothing and had no scruples about pretending that they were with us heart and soul . And last  --  the poor in spirit , who spent a few days in Tel Aviv and saw little houses with clean rooms and a Sabbath loaf , a child playing the violin and a well-dressed woman , theaters and dances and parties  --  and lost heart . The commune itself was a disappointment too . At first it was supposed to exempt us from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasites on the productive labor of others . And now a new bureaucracy had grown up around our necks , inexperienced , incompetent , full of cant and power-greedy . And over and above all these , like a menacing shadow : the Arab question . In Tel Aviv you could walk from one sunny street to the other , in a merry group of children playing barefoot in the soft , hot sand and shouting in Hebrew  --  and ignore it . You could believe that Jaffa was inhabited by savages incapable of understanding the pure intentions of the Jews . In Tel Yosef that was not possible . I remember one picture : a blazing noon , the sheep like a  | huge ball of fleecy wool next to Harod 's spring . A wind passed through the thorns with a husky whisper . In the distance the mountains of Gilead looked like a shimmering mass of bluish vapors . The delicate smoke rising in a spiral above the hill of Kumi seemed the only certainty , lingering on from ancient times . All the rest  --  a mirage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a friend in Russia . World-shaking events were taking place there , he wrote . And what was I doing , I thought to myself ? lying in the shade , chewing a straw , waiting for evening to fall , waiting for morning to come . Suddenly , as if he had materialized out of my own fears , an Arab lad in an old army uniform and army boots without laces emerged from the wadi . With one look he appraised my strength and agility and immediately unloosed a volley of the kinds of oaths which I tried in vain to imitate . The sheep scattered in all directions , as if a bomb had exploded in their midst . I chased after him , cursing him roundly with all the Arab curses that I knew . The boy eluded me in his loose boots and laughed . For a while I stood and shouted , but my voice sounded artificial , alien , false . And then , while the sheep were trampling the scanty wheat growing next to the spring , I said to myself : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that incident I abandoned the sheep . I looked for harder and more manly work . I went to Tel Aviv to learn the building trade . In the meantime I enlisted in the military underground . Shochat took me into his confidence . I learned to use arms . I taught others . I drowned my doubts in feverish activity . The day was devoted to work and the night to self-defense . We had big ideas . We spoke of a navy and an air force . Deputations were sent abroad . I too was considered as a candidate for one of these delegations . My doubts seemed to me the scruples of a Jewish adolescent . The lives of grown men were a struggle for survival , not for justice . Who knows how my life would have turned out if the attempts of Shochat and his friends to set up an independent militia in the Labor Brigade had not been nipped in the bud ? In any case , when the Kibbutz  --  the name of that underground within an underground  --  was disbanded , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were beaten and the opponents of the " general commune " were gaining the upper hand . It was then that my meeting with Daniel took place . Daniel did not speak loudly or passionately . He seemed the reverse of the usual political propagandist . He spoke gently , in a soft , musical voice and with quiet confidence . His arguments were strong and convincing , but he never pressed me to admit that he was right . He allowed me to part from him as if our argument had ended in a draw . At night the doubts he had sown in me grew like mine . His criticism of the Labor Brigade was moderate , constructive . It was a noble experiment , he said , but hopeless . A general commune of workers in a semifeudal country ruled by an imperialist power was a dangerous illusion . A small group of workers with good intentions and revolutionary fervor could tramp the country from end to end without accomplishing anything , except to arouse the Arabs who would sus-pect  --  and rightly so  --  that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living . The Jewish labor leaders had discredited themselves . Intelligent , enlightened , humane people who nevertheless permitted themselves to relate to the members of another nation as if they were some kind of natural disaster ? like the khamains or the snakes . At the most they were prepared to regard them as ungrateful savages . Offered civilization , they did not say " Thank you . " And if anyone ventured to suggest that things might not be so simple , they were immediately ready to cast stones at him as the agent of a foreign power . He did not ask me to join the Party . He only encouraged me to participate in a common organization of Jewish and Arab workers . He introduced me , in secret , to members of the Arab intelligentsia , and waited . The secrecy of the meetings bothered me . But Daniel justified it on the grounds that it was for my sake that these meetings took place underground . The leadership of the Histadrut was hysterical and if they knew that I was talking to an enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if I did n't agree with his ideas , my fate would be sealed . Perhaps it was all simply a question of technique . A crafts-  | man who had perfected his tools . But it made a great impression on me . Bitter and acrimonious debates were then raging in the Brigade . People were raising their voices at each other and sometimes their hands too . And lo and behold , precisely the revolution which was out to subvert the entire order of creation , spoke in the gentle tone of a Jewish scholar . It was Daniel 's language that enchanted me . It did not have the niggardly dryness of Marxist jargon . He talked Marxism in the language of the Prophets . A strange mixture of sociological jargon with Talmudic sayings and Russian symbols . He spoke of our " tortured century " with affection and sorrow as if he were speaking of a mentally unbalanced mother , and of " cataclysmic movements of populations " and " apocalyptic visions " in the same breath as " the birth pangs of the Messiah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " breaking of the vessels . " I repeated his words to various friends , and discovered that they too were tortured by doubts . This was not the birth we had been praying for . It was impossible to make a revolution in these tiny , measured steps . In Soviet Russia a mighty torrent was raging , and what about us ? A little brook , no more , shallow waters , a failed spring ; we would dry up long before we reached the mighty torrent . Perhaps Jewish nationalism was a grave mistake . The solution to the Jewish question would have to be found on a worldwide scale . And only revolution would solve the acute problem . Eretz Israel was nothing but a refuge for the persecuted . And perhaps we should not upset the inhabitants of the country by exaggerated demands . We would only bring down a catastrophe on the heads of refugees from the sword who had fled here for their lives . We would give birth to anti-Semitism in a place where it had previously been unknown . From here it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . If the revolution could solve the Jewish problem , we should devote our efforts to furthering it . Its triumph was far from certain . It was surrounded by enemies , hounded by foes . In all conscience , the comparison was inescapable : just as the individual was called upon to renounce his egoism to build the p 135 commune , so the little national group must renounce its selfishness for the sake of building the new world . When you are for yourself alone  --  what are you ? When you are part of the whole ? you are the place , the time , you are history . ( In 1933 , in Der Emes press , I often met Daniel . He would smile and greet me like an old friend . But he never spoke to me about the Eretz Israel period . After he was arrested I thought that he had kept quiet out of caution . In those days a man who held his tongue with his friend was doing him a great favor . Although sometimes I wondered if it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how far we had taken his teachings and whether he could safely show us how much he regretted the past . In any case , the thought that he was suffering pangs of conscience for leading me by the nose pleased me . It was not a desire for revenge which made me want to believe this . On the contrary : I loved him and this was why I did not want to entertain the thought that he had been manipulating me in ways he had learned in a course for Party propagandists . ) My way into the Communist Party seemed perfectly natural to me . A step which was dictated by my own character . The same impatience which had led me into the ranks of the Labor Brigade thrust me into the " Union of Jewish and Arab Workers " and after that into the Fraktzia . All that time I continued as one of the left-wing activists in the Brigade . Nobody gave me any instructions on how to behave . My instincts told me how far to reveal my true opinions . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although I had no objections to that role either . I saw myself as waiting for the right conditions to ripen : a minority converting souls to its creed without trying to hasten the coming of the Messiah . My garbled quotations from the words of Daniel , which were sometimes beyond my comprehension , served the shrewder men among my elders as a clear proof that what the younger generation needed was a lucid , homogenous ideology . A whole loaf , not a collection of crumbs . We adored mysteries . We had left Russia before the denunciation of " revolutionary romanticism . " We were in love with it .  | An underground within an underground was nothing new to us . I have already spoken here of the Kibbutz . The experienced veterans of Hashomer , like Shochat , did not put too much faith in the Histadrut officials who had taken " security matters " upon themselves . They saw fit to set up a defense organization along the lines of a revolutionary party . When we kept the secrets of the Kibbutz from our friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not think of ourselves as deceiving them . We believed that we had shouldered a responsibility they were not yet ready to bear . We were proud of ourselves . Everyone had placed their necks in one yoke  --  we in two . When the day came we would open the secret arms caches to them and save them from disaster . I felt the same about hiding my Communist affiliations from my friends . When the day came , the others too would be invited into the inner circle . There were some people who woke up and saw the light immediately and others who did so little by little ( like Borya , my tentmate , who woke up in the morning in stages : he yawned , stretched , groaned , lay down again , pulled the blanket up to his chin , and curled up like a fetus , but then his conscience pricked him and he threw the blanket off , abandoning his body to the cruel cold , sat up , muttered something , got dressed with his eyes closed , and fell back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would get up , get dressed , and go outside ) . In those days , after the crushing victory of the Bolsheviks in Russia , it was possible to believe that a little group of people who knew what they wanted and read the signs of the times correctly could suddenly emerge from the seclusion of their smoke-filled rooms and decide the fate of the world . The thought that it was permissible to lose a generation in the wilderness on the way to the Promised Land was not alien to us either . I did not get all my ideas from Daniel . I had a few aphorisms of my own , metaphors with concealed political messages such as : " Gravel is necessary too , but roads are built with rocks , " or " A tributary which does not join the mainstream only creates a swamp , " or " When you 're busy raising a heavy beam you ca n't stop in the middle to scratch yourself , " or " You ca n't make half  | a revolution on half a dunam of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was on the farthest fringes of the left , Berl asked me to write something for the Kontres , something about daily life in the Brigade , or simply reflections . And he flattered me too : " They say you 've got a gift with words . Articulate men are at a premium among us . " After I joined the left-wing list , he decided to do without my services . The underground was also a shield against boredom . A life without flavor  --  every day the same as the one before  --  suddenly took on a new fascination . Your most insignificant acts were only the reflections of more serious matters . You could work in the kitchen without feeling inferior to the laborers in the fields . The man next to you was scrubbing pots and so were you , but there was a world of difference between you . The boring work that you were doing was only a cover ; you were preparing a revolution , and you had the patience , the cunning , and the ability to keep your mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the split I could n't take it anymore . We were no longer people waiting for their hour to come . We were identified and our freedom of action restricted . I had already spoken my mind ( " We are inverting the Jewish pyramid on the backs of the Arab peasants " ) and made myself enemies . We were about to be expelled from the Histadrut . Political arguments ended in blows . I could n't decide whether to abandon the fight or allow the members of the right and center to expose their " true faces " and eject me from the Brigade by force . In the meantime Vera became pregnant and announced that she intended to have the child and bring it up with me or without me . And then relations between myself and the others became so strained that it was quite clear there was no longer any place for me on the kibbutz or in the Labor Brigade . In Vladimir I spent some time in the same cell as an Englishman who had spied for Russia and come fully expecting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest was a kind of trick , to confuse the intelligence agencies of the West . " These things are very complicated , " he explained to me , " and the brains of your  | top bureaucrats work at dictation speed . It will take them a little time to sort things out . " In a moment of truth , perceiving my curiosity  --  What had made a man like him , well off and well educated , put himself at such a risk ? ? he said with a smile , " Pirate ships are full of nice boys who run away from home and family life . " I understood that the same applied to me . But we really and truly believed in what we believed , and we believed that a man has to live according to his beliefs , and ideology for us was very far from idle chatter , a substitute for the yeshivas we had abandoned in our youth . I thought about Vera . I did n't run away from her . I did n't push things to extremes in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to laws of their own . But I had to admit to myself that " these things " too are sometimes " very complicated . " My expulsion from the Labor Brigade cut through a very complex knot with one stroke of the sword . I have never regretted the things I did n't say , but I 've often regretted things I did say . And even more  --  enthusiasm that went to waste . There are about thirty people sitting in the kibbutz club . Most of them were from my own generation . There was only one young girl there . She stood behind the counter and served hot drinks and cake to anyone who asked for them . When she was n't busy she sat on a stool and read a newspaper  --  working , not participating in the meeting . I glanced around me . I knew eight people by name and another five or six by appearance . I could understand why no young people had come . But where were the fifty-year-olds ? I found some merit in it . All those soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other generations never had such grandiose dreams and so they would have no painful disillusionments on waking . I did not know what to say to them . There were a thousand and one tales I could dredge up from my memory . The speaker bears witness not only to himself but also p 139 to his audience  --  whether he wishes it or not , what he says and how he says it reveal what he thinks of them . Anecdotes and stories are for those who want to enjoy themselves in this world ; to those who wish to reform it , one speaks a different language . But were they still interested in the poor man 's wisdom here ? Prohodnik kept nodding off . His deaf wife kept blinking her eyes . Others stared at me with weary indifference . They only woke up a little when I said something they did n't like . Signaling their displeasure with cold eyes : the leopard had n't changed his spots . ( " It 's a question of character rather than ideology , " Avrunin would say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that he meant some kind of psychological perversion which was peculiarly Jewish . A curse afflicting a miserable nation . The burden of inherited suffering . He did n't realize that he was talking like an anti-Semite . " How many more people have to be killed before the Yevsektsia sees the error of its ways ? " he would ask . ) I spoke a little about the democratic movement in Russia . About the setbacks it had suffered over the past year . From the expressions on their faces I could see that most of the facts were already known to them . Who was in jail , who in a mental hospital . The Western press was apparently extremely well informed . I described some of the personalities I knew personally . I sensed that a number of my listeners were displeased that I had n't given them halos . Not all of them were heroes , as people thought here , but ordinary , decent people with principles who in any other place would do their jobs without cheating anyone or devote themselves to bringing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of them had decided to declare war on the regime . Each of them had probably reacted to some piece of arbitrary injustice or some too blatant lie . When he was hauled over the coals he was angry , and refused to confess the error of his ways . For this crime he was punished even more severely than before , and his defiance increased in proportion to the punishment . Thus , step by step , he found himself at odds with the regime as a whole , and he had no choice but to make his quarrel  | with the authorities public or disappear somewhere in the snows of the north . Once he had become a " public figure " they were obliged to beat him with padded sticks . And from then on no one would believe me when I said that he was a modest , unassuming fellow who had no desire to seek the limelight and who would have been willing to compromise at a much earlier stage if , for example , they had agreed to give the Ukrainian poets the honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Zionist activities , the national revival among the youth , and the underground Hebrew lessons . ( I had given Hebrew lessons for a long time myself . I remembered the grammar well enough and knew a few poems by Bialik and Tchernihovsky and Shneur by heart . A friend who had once corresponded with Shlonsky had entrusted me with more recent poems . Quite possibly , it was due to this activity that Perlmutter and his friends thought I deserved special treatment . The truth is that I was not one of those who shouted from the rooftops . The state of my health forbade me to go back to jail . I restricted myself to things that could be done in secret , without exposing myself . After I received a permit to live in Moscow , I disappeared almost completely from sight . ) The questions they asked me in the kibbutz club were about life in general : how much a worker earned and how much consumer goods cost . For a few moments there was a certain unpleasantness . Avrunin requested permission to ask a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own question . He was unmoved by their fate . On the contrary , he seemed to take a certain spiteful pleasure in their downfall . People who ran after will-o ' - the- wisps could expect to be devoured by wolves in the end . They had declared war on the Hebrew language , Jewish schools , and Hehalutz . The Soviet system had put an end to literature , he concluded . Books were printed there but no literature . And the illustrious tradition of the great , humane Russian literature had come to an end . He made me feel very bitter . How could I come to the defense of these unfortunates ? Only a writer could understand p 141 the plight of his brothers who had no chance of seeing one word in print unless they prettified reality a little . An ordinary man might say , perhaps with justice : Keep your self-respect and turn your hand to some other trade where you wo n't have to compromise your integrity . Easy to say . Anyone who has never been forced to wallow in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaving lotion has no right to judge those who compromised their integrity with a broken heart ( even Osip Mandelstam , a great poet not endowed with excessive physical courage , who in a moment of insane bravado wrote a poem about the man with the fat fingers , also wrote a poem in praise of the White Canal where hundreds of thousands perished ) . I said only this : There are scoundrels who lie brazenly and flatter the powers that be ( and sometimes the power is in the hands of the masses ) shamelessly in order to obtain important posts and dachas on the Black Sea . But Russian literature is alive and kicking , and not only in the samizdat . Except that Russian literature is written between the lines . Even the lines themselves are written in code . And the need to write in code sometimes makes for an extra-special brilliance . And those who are not endowed with sharp eyes and ears neither hear nor see . In Russia , I said , even children 's fairytales are full of dynamite . As an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beasts by a certain poetess who had emigrated to Israel in the meantime . Here , I had heard , for some reason she had stopped writing . Could it be because there was no need here for parables and fables in order to criticize the government ? Not only that  --  here she would feel that she was being devious if she chose to hide behind stories about tigers and giraffes instead of writing a logical article that would be exposed to countercriticism in its turn . At that moment I thought : Perhaps we Russians are no longer capable of taking any interest in books written in the West where everything is permitted . In Russian books , on the other hand , even those that contain a few little white lies to pull the wool over the eyes of the censor , we find a feast full of flavor . No outsider could understand .  | All of a sudden I felt a heavy lethargy . Like the heaviness that would come down on me in the period after my return to Russia when I was asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hindsight the problems of Eretz Israel seemed more complex to me . I remembered my opponents of yesterday without anger . I tried to get under their skins , explain their motives , the " roots of their errors . " But my listeners did not want to listen . They knew better than I what was happening over there . They only wanted to hear it from my lips because I had been there . The king 's witness . And it was the same with Avrunin , with Yekutieli , with Efrati ( maybe I 'm wrong about Efrati  --  an intelligent , broad-minded man , he thought that his friends ' eyes had dulled and were no longer able to perceive any shades between black and white ) . They knew better than I did what was actually happening in Russia ; they saw things in " perspective . " From close up a man could see nothing but his own finger . Since the authorities had crushed my fingers , I had been able to understand something at least . But the whole picture could only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-hot sword dangling before his eyes . They knew that there was no truth or freedom in Russia . Everyone lied to everyone else in order to protect themselves from police informers . And everything was dark and bleak ; there was no honesty , no joy . People walked on tiptoe , hugging the walls , looking over their shoulders . You never knew what was permitted and what was forbidden . You never knew who would be punished , or for what crime . The walls were full of ears . A man could not trust his wife , a father his son . The perfect , positive hero , the example to the Komsomol , was the boy who informed on his parents  --  it was a fact ; there was a monument in his honor . Poets were forbidden to weep and writers to joke . Painters were forbidden to make a blot on their canvases . I wanted to say to them : Ordinary bourgeois politeness is also a little white lie . Politeness makes life more pleasant . You tell a fat woman that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hell and your lie wo n't make her any fatter than before . You 're a kindhearted man and no one will criticize you for it . With us in Russia , everything is on a bigger scale , grand and tragic . Over there a lie is the charity that saves from death . When you lie to your friend you save him from trouble . For example , you 're sitting with your pals , having a drink or two , swearing and telling off-color jokes , and you feel like making a heartfelt gesture , something to show them how much you love them . Will you confess that you loathe the Man with the Mustache ? That you are revolted by the cult of the personality which turns you into a deaf idiot obliged to nod like a donkey whenever he mouths some new inanity ? Let 's say you do . What will you have actually done ? If they inform on you , they 'll hate themselves . If they say nothing , they 'll live in fear . Someone else may inform and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might hand over the list of those who heard you blaspheme and did nothing about it . In either case , you 've lost your friends . They 'll be furious with you , and rightly so . What made you behave so foolishly ? You found a worm in your hand and threw into the lap of your friend . Ca n't you keep your mouth shut ? Dig yourself a deep hole and whisper inside it what everybody knows anyway ? In the future they 'll stay clear of you . You 're a dangerous man and you do n't know how to be a friend . Certainly no one will ever open a bottle of vodka in your company again . And the opposite : when you sit in the company of scholars and express your admiration for Stalin 's brilliant essay " On Language , " you 're doing them a great favor . You said it ; they did n't have to . You know and they know that language was not " created in order to . " You know and they know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And nevertheless they 'll love you for it . You are a true friend . You have saved them from agonies of embarrassment . The essay has just been published and it ca n't be ignored . They 'll be grateful to you for volunteering for the role of court jester . After the official ceremony is over and the ritual has been correctly performed , the guests can descend on the refreshments and begin to enjoy themselves . No one will suspect for a moment that you  | really believe in what you said . The musical Russian language has now been enhanced by an additional range of subtle notes which enable its speakers secretly to mock words mouthed in utter solemnity . Human relations have been enriched by subtleties impenetrable to a foreign ear . In the course of time you stop noticing your lies . You wear your agreeable mask as naturally as a bald man wears his wig . Just as a respectable citizen never goes out of his house without a tie and jacket , you never venture out without it . This mask protects you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pleasant lies . You bear their burden as lightly and gracefully as an athlete . Everyone seeks your company . I wanted to say all this  --  but I did n't . Was I there to defend liars and advocate falsity ? I felt disappointed in myself for not having been able to make my description a little livelier . I spoke as if I was giving a sociology lecture , and something basic was lacking . Perhaps I should have said to them : Russia is a place where human beings live . Millions of people live there in all innocence , doing their jobs as best they can , trying to win the approval of those they love . Some are keen to win prizes , others are careful to avoid punishment . Pretty girls who play games and have love affairs cherish feelings under the surface of their honeyed skins that the secret police would have no idea how to classify . In the springtime , behind the bushes in the public parks , in the rowboats , love blossoms . Its ancient pain is pure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men who can play the harmonica and dance and who take pride in the quality of the goods they produce . They are faithful to their wives and friends and they love their children with an enchanting , bearlike love . The thieves and rascals and smugglers have their own solidarity , stronger than all the fraternal alliances we are familiar with , right under the noses of the police . The audiences cheer at soccer matches , wipe away a tear at the theater , listen to music reverently , and eat sausages on the lawns to the strains of a military band . Boys and girls learn their lessons with solemn reverence for the written word , and doctoral students  | burn the midnight oil in single-minded pursuit of the degree that will set them apart from the toiling masses forever . In philosophy departments , earnest young men , as familiar with Marxist literature as yeshiva students are with the Talmud , engage in learned debates about the history of the concept of God . The seminarist from the Kremlin who persecuted clericalists with relentless fury was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source , serving secular goals with a meaning adapted to the needs of the times . Since the word existed in the Russian language , he thought it should be invested with a new content . Otherwise the old meaning would crop up and with it all the old narcotic values . It was legitimate to say about music that it was divine , and also about his own virtues that they were not of this world . One day a young woman met a famous poet at a party in a friend 's house . The next day she wrote to a bosom friend , " Last night I met God . " They wanted to arrest her and charge her with clericalism . The affair came to Stalin 's notice . He called in his advisers . He asked them : Is the man really so great ? They said : A genius . He said : Pardon her . Geniuses may be described in the lexicon of the past , not permitted to ordinary mortals . Presumably he was thinking of himself . Only God allows Himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a God , there are also ministering angels . And a celestial choir of poets as well . In other words , the metaphor was legitimate . There was no reason to suspect the foolish girl of criminal tendencies to bring back the old regime . But when the poet  --  who had in the meantime become the girl 's lover  --  was disrespectful to the sun , then the girl was punished . In the belief that a discerning poet would understand the hint , the young idol worshiper was taken away by polite men in blue uniforms and sent to Taishet to be reeducated . Her case was heard in a Soviet court  --  the most fascinating of all the theaters of the absurd of our generation . Solemn judges and investigators , full of reverence for the letters of the law which gave them their dignity and daily bread , humorless as  | the heroes of a classical tragedy , recited her sins to each other with narrowed eyes and passed sentence on her . The poet , like a caged lion in his dacha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The girl , in the depths of Siberia , came to know the people the poet loved from a safe distance at close quarters , too close for comfort . When she returned , crushed and worn , full of raw folk wisdom , the poet took her to his bosom and built her a temple in his verses . His lawful wife , to whom the glory and the honor were rightfully due , fumed and made scenes in public . The Man with the Mustache smiled to see the havoc reigning in the rival God 's harem . Efrati was not pleased when I expressed the opinion that the Soviet system was not in danger of imminent collapse . The regime was stable , I told them , even though it was founded on violence and lies . People who lived in small countries did not understand the law of large numbers . The people had bread , work , and culture , the latter in abundance : books , plays , concerts , dances , for next to nothing . They did not lack national pride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professions lacked the freedom of their colleagues in the West ? In any case the people envied them a little and hated them a little ( and how much the more so the Jews , who enjoyed the fat of the land and laid their eggs in strange nests ) . And the rulers were experienced and sharp-witted foxes . In Russia , an opportunist can not be a fool . He must have all his wits about him and know how to use his elbows to get to the top . And when he reaches it , at the age of discrimination , he is already adept in the uses of the strap . The intelligentsia are privileged but they are also more severely punished . Academic education makes wiser but not sadder men . Dialectics has done away with the confrontation between good and evil , truth and falsehood , forever . And for the weak-minded there is always anti-Semitism . Like the illicit hooch which it is illegal to brew but legal to drink . The language made things difficult too . In Russian I could probably have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Hebrew which everyone admired . And it was to  | praise of my Hebrew that Efrati devoted his closing remarks , although he also found it necessary to say snidely , " Some of us may feel that not all of our questions have been answered , but .... " When he finished speaking they all got up and walked away , the ones who had slept through everything I said finding it necessary to come and shake my hand before going to bed . I was left alone with Vera and the girl in charge of the refreshments . The two of them cleared away the cups and plates and cake crumbs from the tables and refused to allow me to help them . I glanced through the movement newspapers and waited for them to finish washing the dishes . I looked forward to a sleepless night . I 'll never learn to speak spontaneously and naturally in public . Others talk their heads off without doing any harm to anyone . But I have to pour my whole soul into every word I utter and excite myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The kibbutz grounds were dark and rustling as a forest . Vera walked ahead , shining a small flashlight onto the path and pausing from time to time to make sure that I was behind her . I sensed the dejection radiating from her as one senses the presence of an animal in the darkness . Before we set out from the club she said to me : " If you still keep faith with them , why did you ever leave ? " She spoke in an offended tone of voice , as if she had been personally insulted . " Is that how my words were under-stood ? " I asked . " I do n't know how others understood them . I only know what I understood . " I laughed without really meaning to . And then she exclaimed indignantly : " If that 's the way you feel you should have said it straight out and not beaten around the bush . " I tried not to be angry with her . You ca n't blame a person for the limitations of her understanding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to her . " I do n't understand irony or see quotation marks unless they 're actually written down , " she said . We went to her room to get my suitcase . " We 've been talking about everything under the sun and we still have n't said anything about Nimrod , " I said . " What is there to say ? " she asked and sat down .  | I sat down too . She said , " You have n't said much about yourself either . " We sat there for an hour and a half . She told me her story and I told her mine . Mine was longer than hers . Counting who had nothing he could call his own , not even a family , could speak about the hardships of his life like some collector showing off his treasures . She spoke about her own life as of something . that was drawing to a close . She had married very late in life . Her husband was a widower , a Holocaust survivor , who had come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . She had brought up his two children , a boy and a girl . Both of them had married and moved away . " Would you like to see a photograph ? " She showed me a boy and a girl who resembled each other and had reserved , withdrawn expressions . At the same time she pulled out a number of photos of Nimrod . A baby , a child , a boy , and a man . I looked for similarities to myself . I could n't look for long , since Vera was staring at me curiously and I imagined she was waiting to see signs of an emotion which failed to manifest itself . I asked how Nimrod had reacted when she got married . She laughed . Nimrod was twenty-two years old when she married . And the War of Independence broke out almost immediately . He was glad that she had something else to occupy her attention and distract her from worrying about him . I understood what she was trying to say . She had brought Nimrod up alone , without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had three grandchildren . Suddenly I understood her previous anger . The Soviet Union was supplying arms to the enemy shooting at Nimrod on the Suez Canal . She had wanted to hear me denouncing it in no uncertain terms . And I had scrupulously painted in shades and nuances . " We 've always been close , " she said , holding Nimrod 's photo up to the light . " During all these years . " And as if she could read my thoughts she added , " After he left us he came to visit . Twice a week , sometimes more . " p 149 Then she recalled something that made her smile . " First he came on foot , then on a horse , later in a jeep , and lastly in a truck . " I asked her tactfully , not wanting to offend her , why he had gone to another kibbutz . Vera sighed . There was a split , and he had gone with his friends . Only a few of his peer group had remained on Tel Yosef . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could n't remember exactly what the argument had been about . The party had interfered . After the split in Mapai and the merger of Ahdut haAvodah with Mapam , the split in the kibbutz had become inevitable . She chuckled . " And it did n't take long , no more than a year , before there was a split in Mapam too . " After the first split , Elkind had predicted that one split would lead to another . Fanatics were incapable of compromise . Maybe the next generation , which would have roots in the fields where they took their first stumbling steps , would be able to live with people without having to agree with them in every single respect , so the milder souls among us said then . We liked imagining the future : our children would be children of nature , simple , healthy , without complexes . They would be able to hold their own on horseback with the children of the Bedouin , know how to win with enthusiasm and lose with dignity , and do their duty as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Without big words . Without philosophy and dialectics . They would n't split into factions ready to kill each other with their tongues because of the dot on an i . And lo and behold  --  less than a quarter of a century later the same ideological conflicts were tearing them limb from limb again . There were no mass arrests , no labor camps , but nevertheless . . . It was late and I got up to go to my room . Vera rose heavily to her feet and led the way . Only when we were nearly there did she tell me that I was going to sleep in Borya 's room . " Do you remember Borya ? " " What a question ! We lived in the same tent . "  | " I remember , " she said . " But I was n't sure that you did . " Her voice dropped and took on a mysterious note , as if there was some kind of surprise in store for me . But she waited until we were inside the room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I marveled at the way she did everything in the dark without bumping into the furniture  --  before switching on the light and telling me that Borya had died the week before . Standing at the door she told me the story of his life . As briefly and dryly as a page from an archive . He had remained a bachelor for many years ? " You must remember how crazy he was about Zina Shaverin " ? and then he married a girl who came on an illegal immigrant ship before the war . They had a son and a daughter . The son died of a snakebite . The wife got sick and died . The daughter married a painter who took her to Jerusalem and committed suicide . She was killed in a road accident after her son , a boy of thirteen , was murdered by terrorists . The history of a Jewish family . Borya died suddenly . He was n't ill . The room was exactly as Borya had left it . Nobody knew what to do with his things . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her own sheets . The towel in the bathroom was clean too . Hers . Suddenly she said , " But if you feel uncomfortable about it , come back and sleep at my place . In the other room . " I said , " I do n't believe in ghosts . " She apologized . It was just a thought . Perhaps I had grown more sensitive to these things over the years . You could never know . She herself would not have been able to sleep here . Not until some time had passed . " I 've already lain next to a dying man and waited for him to die so that I could take the boots off his feet , " I said . " I hardly believe in life before death ... " On the table I saw three photographs of children . I took one of them and held it up to the light . " Who 's this ? " I asked . " The son or the grandson ? " Vera smiled . " It 's Nimrod . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she told me anyway . When Nimrod was  | growing up in the kibbutz yard , Borya was in charge of the garage there . And that 's where the boy spent all his spare time . Borya taught him to drive a tractor , a car , to dismantle engines , to weld . And when he grew up Nimrod shared the responsibility for the arms stores with him . There was a warm glow in her eyes as she said , " Maybe it 's because of that that he 's alive today . " After the War of Independence there were only two men from his entire group left alive , she said . One who was abroad at the time and Nimrod , who spent the war first as an armorer and then in command of the workshop which built the first armored cars . And perhaps it was due to this , she added , that he had felt the need to volunteer for active service now , although he had n't been called up . He always had the feeling that he owed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other while he sat in a safe place repairing weapons . And not only that , in the Sinai campaign he was abroad . And during the Six Day War he had been sick with measles . She remembered how angry he had been with her then , for taking such good care of him when he was small that he never caught the common childhood diseases . I passed a restless night , beset by a nervous , painful wakefulness . The stillness of the night seemed full of unfamiliar noises . The hot-water heater in the shower made a soft , whistling sound , like a train in the distance . I could even hear the sheets wrinkling under me as I tossed and turned . Through the slits in the blinds I heard the rustle of leaves outside , the mooing of a cow , the neighing of a horse , and an airplane in the distance . But it was n't the noises that kept me awake . There was a heavy smell in the room . The smell of dust and old age . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghosts whose existence I could not deny . I had always been particularly sensitive to smells , and all the vile smells which had assailed my nose had not succeeded in dulling it . In Kuznetsk , before I obtained a privileged position and a certain amount of privacy , I always tried to occupy the lowest bunk . As the  | stench  --  a revolting mixture of excrement , vomit , pus , disinfectant , and rotting limbs  --  grew denser it would rise into the increasingly hot air and thicken under the ceiling like a fetid miasma . On the bottom bunk I could isolate my private stench and crawl inside it like my own exclusive space . I would shut my eyes , abandon myself to my pain , and insulate myself . In a new place I could never fall asleep until my nose had identified all the new smells . So Borya had departed this world the very week I arrived  --  as if the country was too small to hold the two of us . And Vera still asked me if I remembered him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficult , demanding , discontented kind of friendship between us . I wearied of his gloomy seriousness and he regarded me as a sly , frivolous person whose character needed improving . When I left the Brigade he boasted of having predicted it when I was still a popular fellow for whom people had high hopes . He was a taciturn , withdrawn man who never wasted his words . If he opened his mouth he did so to protest against wrongs , to warn of dangers . He was one of those who got up early to go to work and came home late . Everything he did was full of a suppressed passion . He never cut the wheat like anyone else  --  he saved the crop from disaster at the very last minute . He never installed a tap in the kitchen  --  he saved the girls from untold hardship . And if he beat an Arab shepherd boy who strayed onto our fields by mistake ? he was saving the honor of the Jewish people . Our tent was surrounded by small whitewashed stones , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they turned gray and disappeared . Our oil lamp was polished until it shone . Borya would work away at it with a bit of newspaper and a handful of earth . He always got there before me . By the time I noticed a bit of soot on it  --  it was already clean . He never missed the chance to catch my eye when I discovered that it had been cleaned already even when it was my turn to clean it . I 've met a lot of unfortunate people in my life , but not many of them would have been able to compete with Borya in the pro- p 153 duction of sad , reproachful looks  --  the look of a kindhearted man unfairly taken advantage of . He even made my bed sometimes , to punish me . Sometimes I would tell a dirty joke to embarrass him . He would raise his eyes from his book  --  the lamp was usually closer to my bed than his , so that he had to read in a poor , dim light  --  and give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew that in my heart of hearts I was a serious person . I was a devoted worker and therefore he forgave me everything . Sometimes he took me into his confidence : he did not trust the motives of some of the people who were joining the Brigade ; it upset him to see intelligent girls falling in love with fools ; some of our leaders were unworthy of their positions  --  loafers who took up public activity to get out of doing a hard day 's work . He expected me to reciprocate in kind , but I said nothing . My secrets were not my own property . They were the secrets of the Haganah . And my love affairs were no secret . One day Shochat put his hand on my shoulder and said , " I want to have a few words with you , my lad . " It was the happiest day of my life . I guessed immediately what he wanted to talk to me about . At night the yard was full of mysterious noises . Clanging metal , loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would turn up and unload its freight in secret . Even the chatterboxes kept their counsel . Security was one subject we all treated with a respect bordering on reverence . Shochat led me silently out of the yard , his hand still on my shoulder . When we reached the railway tracks he removed his hand and went on walking . And I walked behind him . We walked some way into the fields before he began talking . He spoke in a whisper , as if there were people listening , and his whisper held a note of firm authority . He had been observing me for some time , he said , wanting to make quite sure that I could be trusted before he approached me . The Haganah was in the doldrums . The Arabs were busy  | arming themselves and our people were playing with pistols . The Histadrut had entrusted the Haganah to a crowd of schoolchildren . They did n't know the Arabs and they did n't have the first idea of how to purchase arms . The leaders of our . political parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emerging here unless it was in the interests of the revolution . They believed that Great Britain would help us , but reality would soon disabuse them of this notion . Great days were in the offing and we would not be ready for them . They spoke of a mass army , and that was their mistake . Normal states could organize armies . The Jewish people could not afford the luxury of drill parades . We had to work underground , like a revolutionary movement , and an underground could not take in a rabble of unemployed . What we required was a strong , clandestine , narrowly based organization . Only people who knew how to keep a secret would be recruited , and I 'd better remember it . The question was political too . There was a left and a right  --  no need to say any more .... I announced that I knew how to keep a secret , and that I would do my best to be worthy of his trust . A few days later I was sworn in . They called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stable , saddled a horse , showed me a point of light at the foot of the Gilboa , and told me to gallop . Many years have passed since , but I still remember the sensation of freedom I felt then , and the warm steam rising from the wild horse 's coat . And the wind in my hair and the suppressed cries on the point of breaking out of my throat . On the edge of a wood at the bottom of the mountain a man wearing a hat was sitting behind a table . Next to the oil lamp lay a book and a revolver . I was n't lying then when I swore that I would never give away the secrets of the organization , even under torture . But the task they imposed on me was harder : I was told to get Borya out of the tent on some pretext or other . He was not to know that they were going to hide a consignment of arms under my bed . What excuse could I possibly find for keeping Borya out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only one that would work : a lovers ' tryst . He agreed to voluntary exile . We were friends , were n't we ? He only wanted to know who the girl was . It was n't much to ask in return for his generosity . I said , " Zina Shaverin . " Why Zina Shaverin ? Because his question had taken me by surprise and hers was the first name that popped into my head . The day before , during supper , I had had an argument with her about an article in Kontres . How could I have known that Borya had chosen precisely that time to fall in love with Zina Shaverin ? And characteristi-cally  --  with all his heart and soul , painfully , worshipfully . When he disappeared in the morning and did n't show up for work , I guessed what the matter was . When we went out to look for him I already knew that the whole exercise was only a test . The barrel we had buried was empty . And Borya was a member of the underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , in order to make things more complicated . I was worried because Borya was the kind of person to do something drastic . Zina Shaverin was an intelligent , serious , modest girl . Borya must have concluded that if she was capable of casual fornication , he would never be able to trust a woman again . I galloped toward a rock on the Gilboa where we used to sometimes sit and look out over the valley . And there I found him , his eyes wild and staring and a loaded revolver in his hand . I took the gun away from him and apologized . It was only a joke , a lie I had to tell him because of a security exercise . If I 'd known it would hurt him , I would have invented some other name . I swore by everything precious to me that I had never touched Zina Shaverin , not even with my little finger . Borya agreed to go on living . But our friendship was spoiled . ( A few words about Zina Shaverin : a flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to Russia she joined a commune called Tel Hai . When the commune broke up and the man she had followed there was killed by a mule kick , she moved to Kiev , where she had relatives . She joined a clandestine group of former Socialist Revolutionary Party members and edited  | their paper . When she was arrested they gave her a show trial . They accused her of treason but they only sentenced her to life imprisonment . She died on the train to Siberia . She got off at some isolated station and joined the queue for hot water next to the lavatory . She was too refined to stand up for her rights and stronger , coarser women kept on pushing in front of her . When her turn came the train began to move . She was afraid they would shoot her for trying to escape if she remained behind and she ran after the moving train . One of the guards played a cruel trick on her . He held out his hand and pulled her into a men 's compartment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she died before they had finished with her or afterward . Looking back : the truth is that I was a little in love with Zina Shaverin myself . But at that time I was capable of falling in love for a few days with any girl in whom I suddenly discovered some grace , charm , or generosity  --  sometimes even good humor was enough . I remember this too : when the man who had been an eyewitness to the rape of Zina Shaverin ( another Jew from Eretz Israel ) told me about it  --  I felt sorry for him , not her . In those days I was unable to weep for the dead . One by one close and beloved friends disappeared or were shot , and my heart grew hardened to the dead . But not yet to the living . I could guess how he felt . He would never be able to forget how he sat there in the train compartment and did n't dare defend her for fear the nonpoliticals would put out his eyes . Did she scream ? Cry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I myself , if I had been in his place , would I have risked my life to save her from the animals who fell on her with savage yells ? Or would I have shut my eyes tight and listened to my soul being murdered inside me ? ) At two o'clock in the morning I switched on the bedside lamp . I found a few week-old newspapers and they seemed even older to me than the Book of the Third Aliyah in which I absorbed myself in the end . With great interest I read articles by the people I had once known , but I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction at what  | I had read . There were no blatant lies , like the lies in Soviet historiography , and presumably everything written in them was true , but nevertheless something important was missing . Perhaps it was the style which stood between the words on the page and what had actually taken place . Perhaps it was the contempt for details which seemed unimportant to the authors of the articles . In any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events through a glass darkly . For example : the Kibbutz . There were a few hints about the Haganah and the crisis in its relations with the members of Hashomer . But it was all wrapped up in secrecy as if some kind of internal censorship was at work here . Perhaps they did n't want to damage old friends ? In any case , I thought , if Borya had written his own story , in plain language , it would have been possible to learn something which the articles in the book did not tell . Suddenly I found myself grieving for Borya . I was sorry that he had died before we met , before I had heard his own version of the facts from his own mouth . Perhaps Borya had understood our relationship from either side of that eternally polished lamp completely differently . It seemed amazing to me that after I left the country we had become unconsciously closer to each other . I wondered if Vera had chosen him for the father of our orphaned child running wild in the kibbutz yard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , or the machines which had surrendered to the touch of his hand ? In any case , this man who was my son had very little of me in him  --  certain hidden characteristics perhaps , an immunity to a hereditary disease  --  and a lot of Borya . Borya had shown him little miracles with a wrench and opened his eyes to the marvel of metal turning white-hot and softening . Perhaps he had also shown him how a man could work bent over all day long and still stand tall at the end of it . According to the Talmud , the father is not the man who sires the child but the one who rears him . And Borya must have seen me in the child he reared . And perhaps he was fighting my hidden influence all the time in order to make him into a man . And until I disappeared corn-  | pletely he could n't make him into his son . Perhaps Borya was taking his sweet revenge . A fine , floury dust covered the books in the bookcase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vera 's eyes must have dimmed if she had n't noticed the dust when she got Borya 's room ready for me . The furniture was simple , square , monkish . The curtains colorless , worn , like old sacking . Only the television and the armchair by its side were in another style . The intrusions of the new into his secluded life . In the other room , which contained a narrow bed and books , there were also two paintings which did not seem to belong to Borya 's spiritual world . A picture of a man riding on a unicorn and holding a naked woman on his hand , in purple , and a black painting with mysterious shapes in gold and brown and crimson on it . Perhaps these were the works of his artist son-in-law whose talents the kibbutz had refused to recognize . I wondered if Borya had really liked them , since he had put them in the other room where nobody could see them . Or perhaps he had mellowed and grown tolerant in his old age ? If some young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not understand , and if other people claimed to enjoy them , what right did he , an old pioneer whose days were numbered , have to turn up his nose ? At this hour of night I would gladly had made up with the old comrades who had dozed through my lecture and also with those who had been angry with me for not saying what they wished to hear . After all , I had no other friends besides them . We spoke in tongues in the same tongue , although we prophesied different things . They too , like me , addressed History in the second person and saw themselves as entitled to interpret her signs . They would never shoot anyone who disagreed with them , but they had methods of their own of excommunicating you . And there was no chance that they would ever see me as one of them again . In a place where there was no punishment , there was no pardon either . I fell asleep at dawn and woke late in the morning . The room was unbearably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 159 and the view of the Valley of Jezreel burst into the room : Mount Gilboa opposite , Beit Alfa and Heftziba like stones that had rolled down the mountainside , and at its feet cotton fields , the dark color of plowed land , glittering fish ponds . Vera had pushed a note under the door : " I did n't want to wake you up . " And she added instructions about how to find the way to her room . She was waiting for me , sitting and reading the literary supplement of the Friday paper . On the table were a bowl of fruit , an apple pie , and a teapot . " The tea 's cold , " she apologized . She went into the kitchenette to put on water to boil , asked if I had slept well , and offered to peel me an apple . We did n't say much . Everything was very domesticated , as if it were all part of a familiar routine . In the afternoon I returned to Borya 's room and wrote . At five o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room of a Jewish scholar . Books from wall to wall , and piles of journals , dictionaries , encyclopedias on the table . Most of his time was devoted to a history of the communes in the United States , where he had been sent as a movement emissary on the eve of the Second World War . He had an amazing collection of Hebrew hooks : novels , volumes of poetry with dedications from the authors . He knew six languages fluently and was also an expert on botany and the physiology of plants . I suppose he would have been indignant if he had known my thoughts . A man like him wasting himself here . If he had n't been infected with the Zionist germ he would have been able to play a role of great significance in the Comintern . His life might have been shorter , but it would have been full of interest and fascination , like those of Yankelevitz , Trapper , " the Worrier . " Even his familiarity with Russian affairs astonished me . He spoke to me as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was one thing that bothered him to this day : What had happened in Russia during the visit of the delegation from the Brigade ? What , in fact , did Shochat really want of the Russians ? Did he really believe that they would agree to train  | Jewish pilots from Eretz Israel ? Was it true that the three of them had been welcomed with great honor and afterward arrested ? It was well known that they had offered Mochonai a chance to study at a technical college and the temptation had been too much for him and he had abandoned the delegation . But what about Shochat ? What did they say to him ? And how had they threatened Elkind , if they had ? There were rumors , he told me , that Shochat had been accused of the fact that his wife had shot a Russian . And Efrati 's strong face , to which age had added a winning nobility , took on an expression of profound con-tempt  --  Manya Shochat had shot a secret agent of the tsar years before the revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismantled the Kibbutz without giving any reason and sentenced himself to total silence . He took the secret with him to the grave . And perhaps he never even told it to Manya . But the essential mystery was what they had done to Elkind . What had they accused him of ? Had they tortured him ? Or simply terrorized him ? When he came back to Eretz Israel was he already a Soviet agent , with orders to cause moral damage to the Zionist movement ? Or had things simply unfolded of their own accord , according to the " dynamic of controversy " pushing the opposing sides to extremes ? He was disappointed that I did n't know the answers . I told him that in ' 26 I was n't yet a Party member . I think he did n't believe me . I told him that when Shochat announced the breakup of the Kibbutz I was very indignant , like many of my friends . But we did n't connect it to his visit to Russia . On the contrary , we were sure that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a takeover by the bureaucrats . I told him about my meeting with Elkind and Krochmalnik . If Elkind had already confessed to the actior and told him all the things he subsequently told me , then the business of the arrest had not been mentioned . Because it had never taken place or because he never considered it important enough to mention ? Or because he did n't trust Krochmalnik ? I do n't know . I told Efrati this too , that in the circles of the Fraktzia a different story had gone the  | rounds . At the beginning , Shochat had made a great impression on the Soviet officials he met . The idea of setting up an antiimperialist underground in Eretz Israel captured the imagination of the more enterprising members of the Comintern . It was decided to send a delegation to Eretz Israel to examine matters at firsthand . The latter , who presented themselves as the commercial attache from Constantinople and his wife , were astonished that anyone would have taken " that fantasist " seriously . They wrote a report to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamer and not a serious person , they said . Efrati sank into thought . He too had said similar things in his time , and now he was sorry for them . " He was a great man , " he said sadly , " and we never knew how to value him at his true worth . He may have taken a few steps ahead of us . Perhaps if he had n't been so striking to look at he might have avoided certain fateful mistakes . " We sat together for hours and missed supper in the dining room . Efrati 's wife gave us sandwiches and drinks , tea and coffee , and alcohol by turn , and late that night we were like two young boys who have discovered friendship . We spoke at length about the last days of the Brigade , and Efrati was willing to hear , without losing his temper , that if they had n't persecuted the members of the Fraktzia so ruthlessly , many of them might have recovered from their tragic love of the revolution , and Eretz Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to perform great deeds . Unwillingly , he listened to the thesis which I put forward , that more than a few of those who had carried on an open struggle against the Zionist movement believed in all innocence that they were saving the Jews from disaster . They were warning the nation against a political adventure in a land whose population would enjoy the support of hundreds of millions of Moslems . We got carried away into a philosophical argument . Did the dividing line between good and evil pass between one man and his fellow or did it cut through our own hearts ? Did ideology  | make us crueler than we really were ? Was the belief in a God or the moral code of our fathers likely to make us better people ? Had n't those who believed passionately in the faith of their fathers murdered millions ? Was there a way back ? And other questions in the same vein which reminded me of the debates on the training farm in Moscow when I was nineteen years old . Except that now there were pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we simply did not have the time to tell each other , to enforce our arguments . The more we talked the more compelled I felt to write everything down . Even if it would make it plain to everyone that we were nothing but dangerous fools in our passion to make history with every tool that fell into our hands , whether it was a hoe , a gun , or a pen  --  it would all be written down and recorded as a warning to future generations not to follow in our path . ( Our paths , to be precise . And yet , although we went in different directions , we did it with the same fanaticism and the same loyalty to a detailed master plan , as if history had entrusted us with a blueprint which would enable us to build a magnificent mansion if only we followed its instructions to the letter . ) We spoke of Borya , too . I told Efrati about my feelings when I found myself in his room opposite the picture of my son . Efrati sang his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time  --  strong , honest , loyal . I surprised him by expressing some doubt as to whether loyalty was really such an important value . People who raise loyalty to the status of a supreme value exempt themselves from the obligation of subjecting their leaders to any kind of criticism or control . They would obey any order , even if it was immoral . Efrati said that Borya was loyal to the idea , not to individual leaders . Then he had second thoughts and said that perhaps the only one Borya followed blindly was Ben-Gurion . " Simple people need to believe that there is someone above them who is infallible , " he went on as if reflecting aloud . I hoped that he would say something about my son . But he hardly knew him . Nimrod was a boy when he went off to join the Palmach . And when he came back he immediately left again to join a p 163 different kibbutz . Efrati remembered only that he was a strong , quiet , athletic boy . And then he immediately added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the lads . " After rummaging through his memory he came up with the remark that Nimrod was a " heartbreaker . " Every time he came home on leave during the War of Independence he appeared with a different girl , each one prettier than the last . But this too did not distinguish him from the other young men . Nor the girls in his company from their sisters . In times when young people are being killed in droves , all girls seem a little more beautiful . Efrati deserves to have his portrait sketched here . Among the other Crimeans he stood out . They gloried in their muscles ; he , in his weakness . They boasted of imaginary conquests , even though the girls who pretended to believe in free love were not nearly as bold as they seemed : he made much of his modesty , although his women pursued him all over the country . Next to the touching efforts of the poet in the group to resemble his fellows , going out of his way to use tastelessly coarse language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolute in his determination not to betray his vocation as an intellectual , was conspicuous . In return for a certain surrender of dignity ? he was prepared to do all the jobs generally regarded as not masculine  --  he was allowed to maintain the traditional posture of the man of the book among the people of the book . He read fiction too , and with all the passion of a true Russian intellectual . He read Dostoevsky and plunged into gloom . Dipped into Tolstoy and recovered . Opened Chekhov and sank into reflection . Secluded himself with Turgenev and filled with love . Herzen 's diary was like balm to his soul . The philosophical works he read were the teachings of the socialist fathers . He began with the first  --  Thomas More , Robert Owen , Fourier  --  and for a time he was also an orthodox Marxist and did n't skip a single word by Marx , Engels , Lenin , or Trotsky , and ended with the last : Bernstein , Kautsky , and their followers . He did n't read books the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge . He studied and questioned them and debated with their authors . Every time he agreed with one it was like an oath of allegiance and a sacred obligation to follow behind the pillar of fire that had been ignited on the path before him . Until he read the next book . When he came across Berl Katznelson 's articles he sat at Berl 's feet . And from then on he was a tireless proponent of his teachings : a working nation with no class struggle . Efrati espoused the liberal point of view with the fanaticism of a Jesuit . His greatest opponents were precisely those who held the same beliefs . Only they held them with weak , flabby hands and Efrati with hands of steel . Although we disagreed on almost every subject , I respected him greatly . And so did the others . When a man is always true to himself , even though he may change his opinions from time to time , it gives him great strength . When other men of letters raised their voices among us , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't put in a hard day 's work . When Efrati spoke , everyone forgot that he had never held a heavy hammer in his life . His ill health protected him . He was the only one of us who had spent some time in a tuberculosis sanatorium in his youth . In those days we related to this disease with something approaching reverence , as if it conferred spiritual benefits on those who suffered from it . And Efrati never opened his mouth to speak without uttering a series of dry , heart-rending coughs . Everyone waited silently for the fit of coughing to end . When he finally began to speak , everyone breathed a sigh of relief . His speeches held his audiences spellbound . In a time when consistency was considered a supreme moral imperative , he gained a following among all those who did not know how to give an unequivocal answer to his rhetorical questions . During a period of bitter controversy , I discovered that he was more cunning than he seemed . Enthusiasm was a tool which he had adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hunting field of stronger and bigger beasts will emit fero- p 165 cious growls . When the arguments grew more acrimonious , he sharpened his tongue . He discovered the immense power latent in verbal violence . He hurled words at us which a stronger man would not have dared to utter for fear of being beaten . He took shelter behind his well-known physical weakness and pelted us with heavy rocks . A well-remembered scene : Efrati leaning against the doorpost of the kitchen door , reading a piece of paper . His face is thoughtful , powerfully concentrated . He sees no one . Hears nothing . A thought stuck in his mind has shut him off behind an iron curtain . Two steps away from him , sitting on a vegetable crate , Zina Shaverin is shelling peas . Through the coarse stuff of her dress and the starched kerchief on her head you can see the slender lines of her figure , her vitality and grace . Efrati 's poker face amuses her . She whispers , " Hey , you ! Where are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pea shells at him . They hit his loose trousers  --  there 's a wide gap between the rough cloth and the skinny legs inside them  --  and fall to the ground . He does n't even feel them . Then she laughs and begins to pelt him with the peas . The look he gives her ! Zina Shaverin 's sweet smile does nothing to placate him . He is furious . She has cut the thread of his thought . How dare she ! And wasting the peas into the bargain ! His anger grows by the minute . Belatedly , he remembers that she is one of " them . " And even the handful of peas she threw at him in affectionate amusement is debited to the political struggle . As if she did it on purpose to put a spoke in the enemy 's wheel . When we were drinking tea in his room I asked him if he remembered Zina Shaverin . " Of course , " he said . " A nice girl . Borya was head over heels in love with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . " " Rubbish , " he said , but there was a conceited gleam in his eyes . " In her eyes I was the devil incarnate . She worshiped Elkind and followed him blindly. "  | Th/ e meeting with Nimrod did not take place as Vera had predicted . Perhaps the word " meeting " is inappropriate . On his way home from the Suez Canal , Nimrod was involved in an accident . He was taken to the hospital with a head wound and I saw him there . A handsome man . Strong features . A fine beard . Straight nose . Clean-cut lips . Unconscious . With his neat beard and the huge bandage on his head he looked like a sleeping Indian . His still body was attached to the narrow tubes of a feeding and warning system which sustained the dim flicker of life in his body . The only sign of life he gave was the pale zigzagging line on a green-squared screen . The nurse allowed us , Olga and me , to sit beside him . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a low but firm voice . It was her duty . His eyes were open and blank . After a while a doctor came in . A young , sturdy man with a flat boxer 's nose . He asked us to leave . We were tiring the patient . He refused to say anything about the prognosis . The injury was severe . The patient had been unconscious for a long time . It was impossible to tell the extent of the damage . The human brain was a mystery . Everything was still open . They hoped it would be possible to bring him back to a state where he would be capable . . . . It was hard to say exactly what he would be capable of . Simple movements certainly . Perhaps later , in the course of time . . . . Surprises happened . . . A stammering doctor gives rise to anxiety . When we left the room we met his wife . " There 's no  | change , " said Olga . " Nira , " she remembered to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " said his wife . Her heart was n't in making new acquaintances . When she came out , her face was grave but her eyes were dry . " He did n't know me , " she said . " Nor me , " said Olga consolingly . The irony of fate . We were all equal in his eyes : his wife , his sister , his father . In the hospital grounds , on a bench in the shade , we found Vera . When we approached she stood up and fell on my neck . I put my hand on her shaking shoulders . She recovered quickly . " We must talk to the head doctor . " She offered us cookies . She knew that he was being fed intravenously but she brought them anyway . Alone at home . But for the dog . Doing nothing was eating me up . Reading was difficult , I could n't concentrate . My thoughts kept straying to the man lying motionless between white hospital sheets . All I could do was write . Writing distracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was trapped there during a cholera outbreak without anything to do . I went over my first notebook . I wrote a letter to Epstein : the meeting with the family . The visit to Tel Yosef . The accident . I added a comment which I would never have dared to write to anyone else : Perhaps I was wrong to have challenged fate . I wanted a son . I got him . Like a baby who had to be washed and changed . Nature did n't like being forced . My daughter too was a stranger . I wrote to Epstein in Hebrew , as he had once asked me to . After sending the letter I regretted it . Perhaps this too was provoking fate . Perhaps it would harm Epstein . Now that he had finally achieved a measure of peace and quiet , I should n't have reminded the authorities of his former sins . A few words about Epstein . If I 've had ten friends in my life , one of them is Epstein . Even five . Even one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such thing as friendship in the world .  | Epstein is a Jewish Talmudist . To my generation this says it all . He could be a revolutionary and a heretic , but in these things too he remained a Jew and a Talmudist . Very Jewish and a typical ' Talmudist . If you cast him into a sewer he would find something there to query and debate . When we said " Talmudist " we did n't mean it as a compliment . With Epstein , it was the opposite . He would prove to us that it was his Judaism which protected him from the filth and degradation . He would say that but for the Jewish tradition of suffering and survival , he would have gone mad a long time ago . I 've already spoken of how he spent the first years of his imprisonment conducting research into the torture methods of the interrogators . And in his spare time he was busy " counting " the number of exiles and prisoners throughout Soviet Russia . He added fact to fact , rumor to rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The computer in his head came up with a number not very far from the one claimed by Western intelligence agencies who had tools at their disposal a thousand times more sophisticated than his . Many prisoners , myself included , became addicted to this drug . Amateur research projects helped us to overcome the long stretches of boredom which were enough to drive anyone insane . As the sand of our lives trickled slowly away , it grew into mountains . For a long period in Norilsk I conducted an investigation into hunger . I wrote down a detailed , clinical record of the changes taking place in our bodies , our minds , and our behavior ( luring the great famine . ( I investigated myself mainly , but also the others . For a time I worked in the clinic , which gave me a certain advantage over my friends . In exchange for a few drams of alcohol I was able to obtain stale bread , which I would share with Epstein to save him from starving . ) I wrote down everything , from the external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions rotted slowly on bunks swarming with lice , I hid in the clinic and wrote . The act of writing itself was a kind of struggle , a clinging to reality . A stubborn opti-  | mism . You 're going to die and you try to be of some use to someone . I really and truly believed then that my research was important . The conditions we were living in would presumably not be repeated . And human beings were not rats , to be starved for the purpose of experimentation . The suffering of these people should not be wasted in vain . I wrote my research in Hebrew , in Latin characters , on the clinic forms . I hoped that I would be able to smuggle it out in the guise of lists of medical stocks . But there was a Jew among the prison guards and he succeeded in deciphering the manuscript after it was discovered . My " research " was destroyed and I was punished . To this day I 'm not certain that my work was of no scientific value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never wrote anything down . " I 'll never succeed in getting a single piece of paper out of here , " he would say . " I have n't got what it takes to be a smuggler . " And he developed a system of memorizing . He was capable of memorizing long columns of figures and doing complicated calculations without having to look at them . " I 've got it all in my head , " he assured me . " And when the day comes , I 'll get it all out . If I live . " We tried to keep him alive : he was the repository of our suffering ; all the facts were in his head and nobody would be able to sweep them under the rug . Whatever was recorded in his prodigious memory would survive forever . He attributed his memory , rightly , to his Jewish education . In the yeshiva , someone who had known him from childhood told me , he was considered a genius . The lazy ones among them would never open a book to resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't too exhausted , he would give courses to the inmates in all kinds of subjects : mathematics , biology , French , medieval history , Talmud , international law , philosophy , Marxism . Once he gave a lecture to the Jews among us about the Israeli economy . It was the fruit of a careful study he made of a p 173 Bank of Israel report which had somehow come into his hands . Epstein himself attached no importance to any of his " research " except for his counting of the prisoners . He would say dismissively that it was nothing but mental exercise , to keep vital organs from degenerating . In prison , he told me , when they were n't taken out to work and boredom threatened his sanity , he would make up detective stories or solve chess problems in his head . A means to cheat time . By the time you 've solved the problem the evening porridge has arrived ... . But others did not agree . They believed that the prodigious labors of his mind would one day yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me that if a man as weak and feeble as Epstein survived what he did in a number of the worst prison camps our times have known , it was only because there was always a nucleus of prisoners who were determined to save him so that he would remember what their dimming minds were no longer capable of holding . As if he himself was a forbidden manuscript passed secretly from hand to hand , to keep it from falling into the hands of the authorities . We met five times , by chance . Epstein said to me : " Whoever has taken the place of Divine Providence up there seems to be arranging things so that we meet again . " The first time was in Vladimir in 1938 . The door of the cell opened and a tiny creature , beaten and bruised and scared to death , was thrown inside . I saw immediately that he was a Jew and began to talk to him . But since my face was smooth and untouched he refused to talk to me . He was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . He had no secrets to tell . He was arrested for a joke . The joke he told ( " Once upon a time a peasant was walking next to a river ; he saw a man drowning and saved him ; the man said to him , I 'm Stalin : tell me your wish and I 'll see that it 's done ' ; the peasant replied , Do n't tell anyone that I saved your life ' " ) was common currency at the time , but someone keen to usurp his place at the Philosophical Institute had taken care that it reach the ears of the man whose word was  | law . Epstein was afraid that in his anguish he might add insult to injury by making some sarcastic remark in my presence which would increase his punishment . He was painfully ridiculous in his efforts to defend his torturers to me ( " There 's no alternative but to take the strictest measures . Our class enemies are many and cunning . They may make a mistake sometimes as they did with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our suffering with understanding than to let the criminals escape their just punishment " and all the other well-worn formulas ) . That was the extent of his mistrust of me . Even when we were transferred to a cell packed with thirty-eight prisoners he tried to keep out of my way . The bullies in the cell tried to push him onto the bunk next to the lavatory pail and I attempted , without any success , to introduce a rule that newcomers would begin there and be moved as soon as someone new arrived , but as long as Epstein remained in the cell the arrangement did n't work : the newcomers would take one look at the wizened creature lying on the end bunk and immediately grab the one that had just been vacated for themselves . When I stuck up for him it only increased his suspicions . He was sure that I was defending him in order to win his confidence and cunningly extort an admission from him which he would later regret . The second time we met was in 1939 , near Riabov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was backbreaking . We had to chop down the trees , transport them on rafts to the camp , and put up the cabins by ourselves . We found it very difficult to meet the quota that entitled us to enough bread and soup to keep body and soul together , since the timber was always being stolen and sold in the adjacent town . We made a tremendous effort to get the camp up before winter . In winter , woodcutters died like flies . Epstein was attached to a brigade of weaklings where the mortality rate was very high . When one of the men in the brigade I led was wounded I attached Epstein to it in the teeth of the opposition of the other men , who did not want to weaken our brigade , which was one of the strongest in the camp . ( When I reach the world which is all good , if it turns out that p 175 there really is a God , the scales will surely be tipped in my favor  --  I saved Epstein 's life . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable drop in the efficiency of the brigade . His productivity was really low and sometimes we even had to carry him home on our backs from the forest , with the last vestiges of our strength . I was faced with a tough problem . I was told that if I did n't find a way to get rid of the " parasite " they would kill him themselves . If we all died of hunger and exhaustion he would die too anyway . But if he was sent somewhere else in time the rest of us would have a better chance of survival . Luckily for me , a commission of inquiry turned up at just this time , and warned the camp commandant that if he did n't start keeping proper accounts he would be punished . I recommended Epstein for the job although I knew that his field was philosophy , not bookkeeping . By the time they found out he was n't an accountant , I thought , he would have a few days ' rest , recover his strength , and maybe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores , whose building had yet been completed . But Epstein sat down at the desk and turned himself into an accountant . At that time we were already friends . In a manner of speaking . In a manner of speaking , because the relations between the giver and the receiver can never be a real friendship . In any case , by this time I had already gained his confidence . Then he told me that for a time he had been a Communist , not out of opportunism , the post he aspired to in exchange for a Party card , but in good faith . In his youth he had traveled a long road from the yeshiva to communism by way of Herzen , Kropotkin , and Rosa Luxemburg . In his eyes communism stood for a classless society and a noncompetitive life . With all his heart he detested competition ( " Nu , you tell me , could I take part in a race with legs like mine ? " he would say ) . While he was still in the yeshiva , before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of winning a point , the parading of erudition , the contempt shown for the less brilliant . He believed that the aim of the revolution was to enable people like him , who were prepared to throw their  | modest wisdom into the common pot to stew there with other ingredients and turn into an active , saving force , to free themselves once and for all from the struggle for survival and the need to measure themselves in terms of success and failure . It was an irony of fate that the only " pure commune " he ever saw in the Soviet Union was in the prison camps . There the laborer was worthy of his hire and the bread was shared equally among the comrades . But in this " commune of scarcity , " which lacked the basic necessities of human life , the prisoners did the work of the guards . They helped them to get rid of those who ate without working . The solidarity that existed there was the worst kind of all  --  the solidarity of the strong against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified affection for Epstein . I admired his prodigious erudition and sharp tongue , but I was n't completely comfortable with his friendship , which had a hint of obsequiousness about it . Epstein did not set too much store by his " poor man 's wisdom , " which came to him so easily , and abased himself before strong men who could work with their hands , ride a horse , breast stormy seas , and lay heavy hands on a woman 's buttocks . He had the sad humor of the cripple which is directed first and foremost against his own deformities , a kind of insurance against being hurt by the cruelty of others . It upset me to see him making these tireless efforts to please " the peo-ple . " Whenever a group of prisoners got together in the hut , the workshop , or at some " social event " ( we had parties there too , and celebrations , and anniversaries of the revolution , and plays and concerts ) , he would try to make them laugh at his expense , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was trying to protect himself from physical violence by allowing them to sting him with words . The third meeting took place in Norilsk , and the fourth in 1947 in Kuznetsk . By then we were already bosom friends . Over there my status was such that it enabled me to ensure his survival . When he saw me he fell on my neck and burst into tears . He told me that he been freed at the end of 1944 and remained in the camp . He did n't have the strength to begin a new life somewhere  | else . He went on working there as an accountant for a salary , married , and led a quiet life for two or three years . And all of a sudden he was arrested again . Without knowing why . When they brought him to Kuznetsk he was sure that his end had come . But the moment he set eyes on me he understood that Providence had decided otherwise . The meeting in 1957 took me completely by surprise . On the last night of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . We went to Red Square to wait for the ringing of the bells at midnight . In that year , at the height of the struggle against the cult of the personality , new hopes had awakened : there seemed some point in looking forward to the morrow . We stood in the square in an anonymous crowd , gray shadows in long furs , " to listen to the throbbing of time , " as a young poet wrote that year . The moment the bells stopped ringing we fell on each others ' necks . There was a strong smell of vodka in the air . We broke into song . A man in a high hat and silver-knobbed cane in the old style , a curious figure who looked as if he had stepped straight out of a story by Gogol , wrote eight numbers in the snow with his cane  --  the outgoing year and the incoming year . A fellow in a dark-green tunic with its collar cut crosswise , who may have been a soldier or a civilian , swayed drunkenly up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A warm steam rose from the melting figures and everyone , including the women , laughed  --  a strange , unseemly laugh . Even a militiaman , standing to one side and observing the scene , laughed . Suddenly I overheard a conversation behind my back . I recognized one of the voices but I could n't place it . They were talking about The Thaw by Ilya Ehrenburg , which had just come out . The moment the voice said , " He makes more sense than Ehrenburg . This snow wo n't thaw until people piss on it , " I knew it was Epstein . I nearly crushed his ribs in my embrace . And then he said to me : " Whoever has taken the place of Divine Providence up there must be doing it on purpose . Five coincidences are no longer a coincidence . " I remember our conversation word for word .  | I scolded him for not guarding his tongue and telling dangerous jokes again . He said , " You 're warning me ! You who hide your writing in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to the dirty snow and advised me to use this ink and this paper , which would leave no traces or incriminating documents . We told each other what had happened to us during the years we had been separated , and Epstein , although he was more skeptical than I was about the anticipated thaw , said that he hoped at least that in the new age time would be treated with the respect it deserved . That we would stop falsifying the past , that we would no longer be compelled to relinquish the present for the sake of the future . And so on and so forth for hours , the way we used to talk in Kuznetsk , in prisoners ' code , with passionate irony . In Moscow , Epstein lived from hand to mouth . He had no steady employment and took any odd jobs that he was strong enough to do . He spent most of his time in a small publisher 's retyping manuscripts which had been cut by the censor . When people asked him why he was wasting his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own , he replied : " A man who quotes his sources may not bring salvation to the world , as the sages had it , but at least he saves one Jewish soul from Hell . " His only way of fighting " them " was humble hackwork . The moment you consented to accept a ribbon or a medal or a star , or an extra plate of soup , from their hands you were part of the system . The private who consents to have one stripe sewn onto his sleeve places the marshal 's baton in the tyrant 's hand . Men of conscience could only be privates . ( I reminded him that in Kuznetsk he himself had only been saved from death because I had consented to be " part of the system " and do " the devil 's work . " He did not defend his theory overzealously . " A question of life and death is another matter , " he said . And he really did n't understand my passion to increase the productivity of the mine when everyone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to explain to him that in my opinion , doing a decent job of work was a matter between myself and my own conscience . But he thought that I was giving p 179 a noble interpretation to the simple wish to maintain my privileged position and please the camp commandant . He thought it , but he did n't say it . In order not to insult me . His eyes said it for him . In Moscow I could already read him like an open book . After we had both been hammered into shape on the anvil of the labor camp , words were no longer necessary between us . In any case , they had become mere embellishments , decorations , a little color perhaps . The gist we could already convey by looking into each other 's eyes . There was no chance that Epstein would ever understand my attitude to work , work pure and simple . His life history lacked the chapter of the Labor Brigade in Eretz Israel , where my basic values had been shaped . A great many theories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the years , and also dropped away from me one by one  --  but the belief in the sanctity of labor never left me . I said to myself : I 'll be a good worker even if a thousand parasites are standing on my back , one on top of the other , and eating the fruits of my labor . Epstein thought I was a fool , an utter fool  --  the kind who makes it possible for a tyrannical regime to last more than a single day . You hit him and he works like a donkey , like a soldier who can not break his oath of allegiance to king and country . But perhaps it was because of this that he loved me . ) A few years ago Epstein was reinstated and appointed editor of the philosophy section of a learned journal . He married again , the widow of a prisoner ten years younger than himself , and became a solid citizen . He started dressing smartly and even bought a gleaming , brightly painted new car . I kept away from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and did n't want to harm him . When we met by chance at a concert he was deeply wounded when I told him the reason for my estrangement . He said to me , " I have no other friends apart from you and Kurakin . " One day I went to listen to him giving a lecture at the Philosophical Institute . He spoke to a large audience of redcheeked boys and girls about the concept of freedom in the writings of Spinoza . " Only a man who never needs anyone else  | can be truly free , " he said . " If the caveman had not surrendered his freedom because he needed to join up with others in order to hunt animals and defend his territory , perhaps we would still be living in the same cave today  --  or else we would be extinct . " " The very use of abstract words is a relinquishment of natural freedom , " he philosophized . And I blushed for him . I considered his words a betrayal , and accused him of self-deception and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote him a letter inviting him to meet me in the university cafeteria . He said to me , " You did n't understand what I was saying . I was speaking against the camps . " I said to him , " I understood the opposite . You 're repaying the one who sewed the stripe on your sleeve and offering him the marshal 's baton . " He looked at me sadly . " Ca n't you forgive me for having a roof over my head and a table and clean sheets on my bed ? " I said , " Half my life I 've listened to you laying down the law on how people should behave , and it 's hard for me to believe that you did n't believe in your own teachings . " He said to me , " I 'm a sick , tired old man . " I could n't be angry with Epstein , but I stayed out of his way . I wanted to keep him in my memory as he used to be . A wise , wizened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak body , an enlightened human being who purposely refrained from displaying his erudition so as not to make anyone else feel inferior . He left the yeshiva , so he once told me , on the eve of his rabbinical ordination . He was repelled by the idea of making the Torah a spade to dig with . And the same applied to philosophy , anthropology , mathematics , and cybernetics . His modesty became even more profound when he turned it into an instrument of protest against tyranny . And now his maturity was disgracing his youth . They had cleared his name , offered him an " extra bowl of soup , " and he had suddenly discovered that " freedom is the understanding of social necessity " ( too fastidious to repeat the usual quotation in all its banality , he hid behind the skirts of Spinoza and found something in his writings too which would serve his purpose ) . When I was informed that I was about to go to Israel , I  | called him up . This time we met in his apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wife served refreshments on silver plates . Epstein welcomed me with exaggerated heartiness and stood on tiptoe to give me a paternal pat on the shoulder . " Going to Israel is a bad mistake , " he said . He was not an anti-Zionist . On the contrary : in advising me not to go to Israel he was expressing his concern for the future of the state . Israel required strong young people capable of working  --  peasants or soldiers , not people like us : " old Marxists who can thread a bear through the eye of a needle , " he concluded humorously in order to soften the harsh impression of his first words . " People like us , " he added , as if I were asking him to come with me , " can only be a burden to them . " I told him that I had not given up hope of finding some respectable work to do . " And anyway , " I added , " I 'm not going there to help them to defend themselves or give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know my family . " " Why do n't you go for a visit and then come back ? " he suggested . " Will you arrange it for me ? " I asked mockingly . " I could try , " he said . His eyes expressed the quiet pride of a man making a promise that he had it in his power to keep . " Thank you , " I said , " but I think I 'll buy a one-way ticket nevertheless . " He accompanied me to the door with a joke that was typical of him : " Old people in previous generations used to go to Eretz Israel to be gathered to their fathers , and you 're going to be gathered to your sons . " As we parted he asked me to write to him . " Are you sure it wo n't harm you ? " I asked . " Nonsense , " he said , " those days are a thing of the past . " I did n't know if he was being ironic or hypocritical . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corridor , next to his bed , at the hospital gates . Sometimes we stop . I  | look into her eyes . Big black eyes which evade my look . We do n't talk much . Hello , good morning , good afternoon , what 's the time ? ? that 's all . We have nothing to say . I 'm sorry for it . And even what I ca n't say to her . We do n't talk about his condition . There 's no improvement . And it 's worrying . What can we say ? What do we feel ? After all , we ca n't say anything encouraging . We pass each other without touching . One day the head doctor came into the ward . I waited on one side until he was free and then I approached him . He talked to me as he walked . Asked me who I was . What right I had to know . I told him I was the father . At the same moment Nira came up and overheard . A strange glint appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false colors . The doctor smiled at her , put his hand on her shoulder , and said that there were encouraging signs . I saw that she believed him . Even though he did not say what the signs were or what they meant . I did not believe him . I do n't like doctors who permit themselves to throw out irresponsible remarks and expect their words to be taken as gospel just because they are in a position of authority , as if they were the rulers and we the ignorant masses . She was in a good mood that day and I could say more than one word to her . I told her that I felt in a very strange position . Standing next to the bed of my son whom I did not even know . She said nothing and passed her hand over his brow . And then I made a bad mistake . I asked her if she had anything written by Nimrod which I could read . I did n't mean what she took me to mean . But with my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't reply to my question right away . First she said , " He was n't much of a writer . " And then , after a pause to consider what she wanted to say , she added , " There are some things that I ca n't show you without permission . " Like the stab of a knife : you 've already buried him . I went back to my desk but my heart was n't in it . I did n't see any reason to sit and write . I had no more illusions . A page written by me was n't going to wipe out a single page in the Lenin  | Library . In my heart of hearts I suppose I had hoped that one ( lay my son would read my notebooks . Now I could n't be sure of that either . I would have to learn to write a letter to a stranger . I suppose real writers must feel the same way in front of a blank page . Sometimes it whets their appetite . Sometimes perhaps they shrink from the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something else . Translation . There the borders are clear . You empty one vessel into another , as they say . One empties out and the other fills up . I feel grateful to the official of the Jewish Agency who found me this work to do for a Russian journal that comes out here at regular intervals . Perhaps in order to disabuse me of the idea that I would ever be able to get work here in my own profession . Olga found me some letters that Nimrod had written to her many years ago . During her military service and for a while afterward they corresponded . In recent years they had not written except when one of them was abroad . Postcards , mainly . But these she had not kept . She had not known of his existence until she was fifteen years old , she told me . She had found out about it completely by chance . Her mother was a woman who kept her secrets to herself , she said . Perhaps she did n't want her to get involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother been truly affected by her husband 's faith , or was she perhaps like one of Chekhov 's Moabite women : Where thou goest I shall go  --  one step ahead of you ? Her stepfather was strictly Orthodox . Presumably he would n't have wanted Olga to have any contact with people who might dismiss her religious beliefs as a lot of nonsense . He did n't trust the firmness of her religious convictions , and he was right . She was an obstinate , rebellious girl . And perhaps he too knew nothing about the past . In any case , her mother did not see fit to tell her that she had a brother . And but for the sting of a scorpion in the Judean hills she might not have known to this day . The scorpion strung her during a school hike . They rushed  | her to the clinic at Kibbutz Ramat Rachel . The nurse who wrote her name down on the form said in surprise , " That name reminds me of someone . " I interrupted her story . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the name Berkov ' ? " " Not mother , me . " " And she let you ? " " Like hell she did ! " Olga smiled . It was a kind of battle , she said . She was a " very naughty " girl and made her mother 's life a misery . Today she could guess the reason : a protest . She could n't stand the way her mother had changed right in front of her eyes . As if the man was kneading her into another shape . As if everything she had been up to then was " null and void . " Everything that had been permitted in Germany was suddenly a sin . In any case , on official documents her name was Zilberstein , her mother 's name after her marriage to her stepfather , but in Ramat Rachel , in her mother 's absence , she said " Berkov . " When the nurse said what she said , Olga did not know that she was on the verge of an astounding discovery . She just asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a long time ago . " But nevertheless she answered her question . Someone who had been in the country many years before , and then returned to Russia and disappeared . And then she said , " My father was here too , and then he went back to Russia . " At that moment a middle-aged member of the kibbutz came into the clinic to get an injection and the nurse said to him , " Listen to something interesting . " And the man said , " Very interesting , but there could be more than one Berkov , you know . If anyone knows anything , it 'll be Vera . " The nurse explained that Vera was a woman from Tel Yosef who had once been Berkov 's girlfriend . " She 's got a son there too , if I 'm not mis-taken , " said the man . To this day Olga could n't understand how she had dared to do it . Perhaps it was the mystery which attracted her . Perhaps it too was a part of her protest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tel Yosef . " " My name is Olga Berkov , " she wrote , and gave a short summary of the events of her life . As much as she knew . Was there any kind of connection between them ? The letter reached its destination and the reply was not long in coming : ' There may be . But I 'm not sure . Why do n't you come to Tel Yosef and we 'll have a chat . " Together with a timetable of buses from Tel Aviv and Afula . Vera had always been a practical woman . And in a P.S. she asked why Olga had requested her to write care of a friend . Did n't her parents know that she had written ? Why not ? It was n't a good idea to hide such things from one 's parents . Olga wrote another letter to Vera . No , her parents did n't know , and there was no reason why they should know . It was impossible for her to come to Tel Yosef . She would never be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when she grew up and was independent she would come . Vera wrote back that they had a special kitchen for the old folks where they kept everything strictly kosher . But if Olga could n't come , she would understand . Whenever she came , she would be a welcome guest . But she never went . She had plenty of nerve , but not enough for that . In the meantime the War of Independence broke out and Jerusalem was besieged . During the war she volunteered to work in a hospital , and there she again met freethinking people : the wounded , the invalids , and their friends who came to visit t hem . She fell madly in love with a certain boy from the Palmach who died a long-drawn-out death . She saw it as a sign from on high : he was a member of Tel Yosef ; he knew Vera ; he was a close friend of her brother 's . One Sunday she went out to fetch water and she was caught in the shelling . She ran into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived there . That was how she met the girl who became her closest friend , Rachel . The daughter of a well-known Jerusalem family , her father was a lecturer in zoology . Sympathetic to the labor movement . He too had a brother in Tel Yosef . All the roads led to Rome . She became a frequent visitor to their home , although her  | parents disapproved . After the war she took part secretly in youth-movement activities . She was obliged to tell lies , to pretend , and in the end she declared an open revolt . Her mother reproached her and tried to frighten her , but her stepfather allowed her to go her own way . He was not a man to fight lost wars . All he wanted was peace and quiet . He had recently been appointed director of a well-known yeshiva and his only concern was to keep it from getting out that he was nourishing a wayward daughter in the bosom of his family . For some time there was a state of truce between them . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp before joining the army , she went with them . Her parents did not try to stop her . They knew that it was beyond their power to do so . When the time came she would go into the army too , with enthusiasm , with ardent commitment , keeping faith with the soldier who had died before her eyes . The work camp was at Tel Yosef . She needed no more signs : it was fate . For one evening she controlled herself but the next day , after work , she could hold back no longer . She asked for Vera , and with trembling knees she stood on the threshold of Vera 's room and knocked at the door . Vera gazed at her with overflowing love and said , " I knew that you would come . " A conversation of ten minutes was enough . It was clear that the father of this girl was also the father of her son . But Nimrod was no longer at Tel Yosef . A few weeks before , he had left with a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to take her there immediately . But Olga hesitated . She wanted to see him from a " safe distance " first , before she made herself known to him . Young people born in Israel , and especially those born on the kibbutzim , made her feel obscurely afraid . On Saturday she got up and made her way alone to Nimrod 's kibbutz , " incognito . " When she arrived there the whole thing seemed idiotic . She wanted to go straight back to Tel Yosef and send him a letter . But she was so conspicuous in her strangeness that someone immediately rushed to her aid . When they asked her who she was p 187 looking for , she was obliged to answer . And so she found herself standing in front of Nimrod 's room . She wanted to escape the minute the man who brought her there left , but before she could move away from the front of the hut , " where an exhibition of colored bathing trunks was flapping on the clothesline , " a young woman pushing a pram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pram , with no way out . The young woman was her brother 's wife . " Can I help you ? " she asked . Olga mumbled something , the gist of which was that she was just going for a walk . " She had walked down to the main road from Tel Yosef and hitched a ride with the first car that passed , which had dropped her off here . Nira , with " newfound missionary zeal " and a " certain feeling of obligation toward anything that came from Tel Yosef , " invited the anonymous young woman into the room . And although she was busy with the baby , who chose that exact moment to start screaming , she even washed a bunch of grapes for her and offered her a plate of cookies . Until Nimrod arrived , a strange conversation took place between them . Nira seemed to her a " fanatical kibbutznik , " upset by any hint of criticism . ( She had n't intended to criticize at all ; her only offense was to ask , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? because she wanted to bring her brother a gift after examining their room to see what was missing . ) Nira was apparently determined to persuade this stranger  --  especially after discovering that she had received a religious education  --  that kibbutz life was preferable to any other way of life in the world . Olga was embarrassed and tried to gobble down the grapes as quickly as she could , in the hope of getting away before her brother came . But just as she was saying goodbye to Nira , Nimrod arrived in clean working clothes . " We have a visitor , " said Nira with the childish glee of a Girl Scout who has completed her quota of good deeds for the day . Nimrod held out a big rough hand which crushed his sister 's hand in a hard grip , and the smile of a man who was " well aware of his success with the opposite sex " crossed his face when he saw her wince . After assessing her feminine charms with one insult-  | ing glance , he went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gossip ... . Olga did not make herself known to her brother . She went back to Tel Yosef and wrote him a letter . A few days later he arrived , on horseback . " Let 's have a closer look at you , " he said when he dismounted , " excited but trying to pretend that it was all a big joke . " After that they walked shyly side by side , stammering like a pair of bashful lovers . " Nira knew at once that you had n't turned up at our place by accident , " he told her . After she joined the army they corresponded . Olga wrote him long letters , whereas his grew shorter and shorter . In the end she took pity on him and stopped writing . And after that they never wrote to each other except when they had news to convey or something particular they wanted to ask . These businesslike letters , she said , were simple , honest , and full of charm . Ever since her marriage they had visited each other regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But sometimes simply when they felt like it , on a fine winter 's day ... " Vera had n't told him anything ? " I asked . " She did tell him , but he had forgotten all about it . " " What do you mean , forgotten ' ? From the day you wrote to her until the day you went to Tel Yosef he managed to forget ? " " She told him when he was a child . And he forgot . He had a sister in Russia , so what ? Russia was very far away . On another planet . In another time . " My astonishment must have been written all over my face . Olga , who was very perceptive , needed no more than one quick glance to guess my thoughts . How did Vera know that I had a daughter ? I never wrote and told her . Olga was surprised that I should have kept such an important fact of my life a secret from Vera . " But why ? " she asked indignantly . " After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you possibly have had for keeping it a secret ? " I did n't know the answer myself . Thirty-three years later it did seem silly . Or at least odd . Perhaps I did n't want to hurt her feelings . Perhaps I was intent in those days on cutting p 189 the last threads that tied me to Eretz Israel . Two separate worlds which never touched . So who was it who had seen fit to " inform " on me ? " And she did n't tell him when you wrote from Jerusalem ? " " No , she was n't sure yet that I was your daughter . She wanted to make certain that it was n't a mistake before she told him . And when I came to Tel Yosef with the youth-movement camp and turned up on her doorstep by surprise , I asked her not to tell him anything . I wanted to take him by surprise too . I was very fond of playing games in those days . " " Did your mother know ? Was she pleased that you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They were n't pleased that I had chosen another way of life . But they gradually came to accept it . I always went home to Jerusalem when I got leave from the army . All they expected of me was not to embarrass them in front of their friends . " After a moment 's thought she added : " Mother had more than one reason for not being pleased , I imagine . " Recollections for which she found no expression in words flitted across her face . I did n't trouble her with questions . Any attempt at cross-examination would only have made her withdraw from me . For the most part she refrained from speaking about her mother and her stepfather , but the empty gaps in the mosaic were being filled in little by little nevertheless . I only slipped in one question : " Your mother tried to obliterate me , did n't she ? " " Obliterate is too strong a word , " said Olga , and a momentary sadness crossed her face . " She tried to forget the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been happy to see me suddenly making contact with a man who in her opinion and that of her husband could only have a bad influence on me . Although Nimrod and I never tried to trace you  --  people said that you were dead but it was impossible to check if it was really true  --  nevertheless the thing we both had in common was you . Mother had never gone out of her way to remind me that her husband was n't my father . And now Nimrod 's entry into my life naturally brought you back too . "  | " Did you ever talk about me ? " " Who ? Mother and I ? " " No . You and Nimrod . " " Of course we did . We even asked ourselves what kind of person you were , but we never tried to dig up past history . The picture Vera showed us  --  it was rather blurred , you must know it  --  of you mounted on a horse was enough for us . Actually Vera would have been quite willing to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt uncomfortable whenever she talked about the past . She tried so hard to idealize things that she made us feel there was no lie she would shrink from to enable us to be proud of you . Do n't forget that as far as she was concerned , you were already dead . " In Kuznetsk when each of us lay on his own bunk , staring at the ceiling or the planks of the bunk above him , we would talk far into the night . Heavy , brooding conversations which touched on all kinds of curious subjects and went on until there was no one left awake to listen . We would lie on our backs and address stories , thoughts , snatches of ideas , to the hut at large . Whoever heard heard , and whoever felt the wish to respond responded , or opened a new subject , as if he was talking to himself . And whoever fell asleep fell asleep , retiring into his - dreams while the others went on spinning out their thoughts . At first loudly and then in lowered voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were situated far apart they would sometimes climb down from their bunks and huddle in the aisle , talking passionately without making a sound . I do n't remember who began it , maybe it was the eternal student , Kurakin , who was trying to trace the presence of God in the elements of chemistry . In any event , one night there was a discussion  --  in a place which could not have been less worthy of the subject  --  about the immortality of the soul . Kurakin insisted that it was impossible for a man to disappear without a trace . First of all , he went on existing in the thoughts of those who remembered him . Things he had made or written existed somewhere too . And after he was dead and buried , his body p 191 broke up into its elements and took part in the natural process . A plant was nourished by his decomposition and rot , and an animal ate the plant , and a man ate the animal , and so on and so forth , to infinity . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said sarcastically , " That 's really a thought to warm a man 's heart : you thought you were dead and gone when all of a sudden you wake up again , happy and contented , in the shit of some Chekist who ate the meat of a calf that grazed on he grass growing on your grave . " And his friends joined in : " A prisoner never disappears : his file is preserved in perpetuity " ( as a matter of fact the inspiring message " Never to be destroyed " was indeed written on the files of the " white-hands , " or political prisoners ) " and the investigation continues after the resurrection of the dead . " Others were happy to discuss the subject seriously . Even the sworn believers in a harsh rationalism had a secret hankering for the transcendental . " For a true Commu-nist , " someone said then , " the very fact that he is willing to sacrifice his life and renounce all wordly goods in order to build a better world for others gives him a stake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that somewhere out there , in the world outside the camp , where " true Communists " had been incarcerated together with false Communists , opportunists , and just plain criminals  --  murderers , rapists , forgers , and thieves  --  there was a firm nucleus of fearless Communists who did not yet know what the Cheka was doing . When they found out , we believed they would mount the barricades and purge the government offices of the dregs of humanity who had taken control of the bureaucracy . In the end only the two of us were left , Epstein and I. Epstein , who loved Kurakin , smiled at his " proofs . " " We 'd better leave chemistry to the chemists , " he said . " But it really is inconceivable for a man to disappear without leaving a trace . I ca n't prove the immortality of the soul . I simply refuse to believe that it does n't exist . And the immortality of my own soul lies precisely in my refusal to believe in its extinction . " And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself will probably  | disappear completely in spite of what I believe . As if I 'd never existed . You 'll remain . . . you 've produced offspring . " " Offspring ? " I said . " I do n't know them and they do n't know me . As far as they 're concerned , I 'm a ghost from another world . Children you did n't bring up yourself are no better than chemistry . " Who knows , perhaps at that very moment , far away in a distant country , a young man dismounted from his horse and looked closely into the face of his sister . That night I read Nimrod 's letters to Olga . She had not kept all his letters . Some had been lost in moving . And she could not find all those she had kept either . One bundle was buried somewhere in an attic or a box full of old things . " One accumulates so much stuff over the years , " she said . " Ornaments , knickknacks , toys , souvenirs , letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sort them out and throw away the rubbish , they have already become part of your life and it 's impossible to throw them out . And when you need them , you 've forgotten where you put them . " Most of the letters were from the years 1952 to 1956 . ( The Kuznetsk period ; in other words , when the discussion about the immortality of the soul took place . ) They were written in a lightly humorous style and it was only rarely that a serious note was struck , or a thought capable of casting light on the personality of the writer . A certain embarrassment was evident . The way a young man writes when writing does not come easily to him and he has not yet decided on the right style to adopt in corresponding with a younger sister he hardly knows . Many of the letters were invitations to holidays or family events , ending with the promise that next time he would write at length . There was no way of knowing if he kept his promise , since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his letters . Sometimes he mentioned the day of the week , or the fact that it was the eve of  | a holiday , or the Sabbath . Occasionally his humor was warm , genial , affectionate , like the way he informed her of the birth of his second son ( " our second daughter is a son , too " ) . And occasionally it was smart-alecky , empty , and irritating ( " we do n't eat nonkosher girls here " ) . The form of address was brusque , lacking in any term of endearment ( " Shalom , Olga . " Or : " To Olga , shalom . " Or simply : " Shalom . " And sometimes with no form of address at all . On the top line : " Tel Yosef , " with the date or without it , and on the line after that the beginning of the letter itself ) . Only once did I come across " My dear sister " ? and that was when he was angry . She had written something that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to know what it was . He wrote only that he did n't agree with her ( " not on any account " ) , but that he would tell her his reasons when he saw her . In conclusion , he never wrote " Yours . " He wrote " So long . " Or " Awaiting your reply . " Only once did he write about any conflicts of his own . It was hard for him to decide , he wrote , whether to insist on going to study at the Technion , despite the objections of the kibbutz secretariat , or to content himself with a short course at the agricultural college ( " The degree does n't interest me at all , " he wrote . " But the question is if I 'll be allowed to direct a project by myself , or if I 'll have to look for some engineer to sign for me " ) . The year ? 1954. the most serious letter addressed the question of hired labor on the kibbutz . Presumably in response to some critical remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ workers from the development towns which were suffering from unemployment ? The letter , which claimed the right for the kibbutz to " preserve its framework and values " even when there was " a certain amount of hardship " which it was " the job of the state to take care of , " since there was no point in " destroying the most important achievement of the country simply in order to provide a partial solution to a temporary problem , " testified to his unqualified loyalty to the movement dogmas . I wondered if he lacked any aptitude at all for the expression of feeling  --  apart from those humorous passages which  | conveyed both affection and a sincere attempt to amuse his correspondant  --  or whether perhaps , in all these years , he had not succeeded in finding the right " tone . " I wanted to believe that the letters to the women he loved contained more tenderness , without the cynical , arrogant shell of a boy who refuses to grow up . One letter was rather different from the others . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly personal question . And did so with all the sense of responsibility of an elder brother . It was a particularly long letter , full of question marks and short , blunt sentences ( " What 's all this about getting engaged ? Who gets engaged here ? I 've never even heard of it . You 'd better make sure that he 's not up to some funny business . Do n't be shy to ask him straight out if he 's already divorced from his wife . Do n't take a step like this without thinking about it first . " ) And so on and so forth  --  unequivocal interference in a matter of the greatest intimacy . He himself feels that he has gone too far and in a postscript he apologizes : " I hope you 're not cross with me . I do n't really know the man . I met him once or twice in the army . But I 've heard all kinds of stories about him . And I want you to know that I worry about you . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read these letters with an avidity stemming from simple curiosity as well as a certain voyeuristic pleasure , I was gradually overcome by a growing sense of disappointment , which settled on me as slowly and imperceptibly as the dust falling on the head of a man working in a quarry : my name was mentioned in the letters only once ! I had imagined , and Olga herself had confirmed ( " We never tried to trace you . . . to dig up past history " ) , that they had not wasted many words on me . But nevertheless , when I read one letter after the other without coming across a single passage expressing some kind of interest in their common origins , in the man who had given both of them life and disappeared  --  I was hurt . I told myself that I had no right to expect it , but nevertheless . . . As if it was evidence of some kind of insensitivity , or of the cutting off of one generation p 195 from another ( an irrefutable argument against " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consequently , I was overcome by joy when the words " our father " appeared in one of the letters . ( Although , on further consideration , the form he used struck me as rather chilling , especially as this kind of formality was so far removed from his usual usage . ) In the letter in question he wrote that one day he had gone to visit his mother . When he went into her room there was " someone called Efrati " sitting there . Efrati was considered worthy of one and a half lines ( " If you read Davar , he writes articles about culture and society there . I 've never read them . Maybe now I 'll try . When you know the person it 's different " ) . Although he had known Efrati since he was a child , he wrote , he had never actually talked to him . The man , who had been " driven around the bend by the split in the kibbutz movement , " began to attack him because of the " orientation toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had " received as a dowry from Hashomer Hatzair . " ( He was so impressed by Elrati 's language that he quoted a whole sentence word for word with a kind of wonder , marveling at the members of a generation who still spoke in that kind of rhetoric : " They 're lifting their eyes to the north again , to see if a candle may have been lit there . . . . " ) An argument flared up which Vera , who ca n't stand political arguments , tried to cut short : " What do you want of him ? You still have n't finished settling accounts with Vitya . " And thus the conversation turned to me ( " and then he suddenly began to talk about our father , and Ma could n't stop him " ) . He spoke with passionate denunciation about the Yevsektsia , which had " ruined our culture " and " destroyed everything good in Russia " and about the Communist Fraktzia in Eretz Israel , which had " finished off the Labor Brigade and collaborated with the Mufti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted that if he did n't stop at once she would have to ask him to leave her room . A few days later a letter arrived from Efrati . He apologized for hurting Nimrod 's feelings . In the heat of the argument he had forgotten that he had been speaking of a man close to him  | ( " although he had sinned , he was still close to him " ) and wanted to correct any false impression he might have made . He had not meant to call Nimrod 's father an " enemy of Israel . " To appease him , he sent him a more faithful description of the man " who was our comrade and was led astray by false lights . " " I 'm sending you Efrati 's letter , " Nimrod added at the bottom of the page . " Maybe it will interest you . " And sideways , in the margin  --  since there was no space left at the bottom  --  in tiny scrawled letters : " I never answered his letter . But when I met him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't hurt my feelings at all . I do n't know our father and I do n't care what anyone says about him . " In another letter I found : " Maybe do n't care ' is n't the right way to put it . I care about a lot of things . And I always want to know . But I do n't exactly attach too much importance to it all .... " I desperately wanted these words to have been written in reply to Olga 's question ( " Do n't you really care ? " ) , but there was no way of knowing if they were or not . Because the letter in question had no date . And he may have been reacting to something else entirely . Efrati 's letter gave me a peculiar satisfaction . It is n't often that a man is privileged to hear his own obituary . Efrati 's letter , as he himself described it , was a " portrait " painted from memory . It was not my own face that I found in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The period , wrote Efrati , was one of " upheaval and radical reform . " People believed that the millennium was at hand . The revolution awoke dormant hopes , and , but for the anti-Semitism which " raised its head " and reminded the young Jew that " if he did not take his destiny into his own hands , he would be lost , " that entire generation , " at least its younger members , " would have been " sacrificed on the altar of the world revolution , " happy in the thought that they had been able to " oil the wheels of the revolution . " " The pioneers of the nation " who immigrated to Eretz Israel were torn between two faiths . The Labor p 197 Brigade was by way of being a " saving solution for spiritual and physical distress " at one and the same time . But reality woke them rudely from their dreams . The " general commune of the workers of Eretz Israel " was a utopia impossible to realize , despite " all the enthusiasm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few , because they became disillusioned with the Brigade and their comrades and the possibility of a life full of " ecstasy and inspiration , " became disillusioned , too , with Eretz Israel . They returned to Russia in the belief that the " pure commune , " a " task force " ( an expression he may have used in an attempt to impress a young army officer to whom the phrases of those times meant nothing ) dedicated to the realization of lofty ideals , could be established only in a country where the regime itself held the communal ideal in high esteem . After this introduction he devoted a few lines to me , too . " Your father was a strong lad , " he wrote , " usually high-spirited but tending to moodiness ; lonely , since he was not a member of a big and well-established group , but had joined the Brigade together with three or four friends , one of whom committed suicide while the others scattered to the four winds . " He had a " powerful ambition " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do he could do " as well if not better , " and he therefore ran from one job to another and learned a number of trades within the space of a couple of years . In the " political sphere " he had no " particular ambitions " and he was " quite passive " in the first years ; perhaps if he had not learned Arabic ( luring the period when " he got it into his head that a person could n't be a shepherd without learning the customs of the Bedouin " he would not have been " carried away to the extreme left and beyond . " Here there was a general remark : The " soul hunters " of the Communist Party ( the Fraktsia , the Socialist Workers Party , the Palestine Communist Party ? " the same dish with a different dressing " ) had made the ability to expose the weak points of t heir " victims " into a " fine art . " " With your father this was the Arab question . " And since " a scappy knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he " saw the situation correctly " whereas others " completely ignored the problem " from the " moral " as well as the political point of view , these missionaries succeeded in " pushing him to the wall " until he was obliged to admit that they possessed the " philosopher 's stone  --  the universally just solution . " And since he was " a young man with a conscience " as well as being " a little mixed up , " he found himself in honor bound to throw in his lot with them " to the bitter end . " ( As for " collaboration with the Mufti " ? I was given the benefit of the doubt . Efrati wrote that my connections with the members of the Shomer , and my activities in the Haganah , before I " was led astray , " presumably held me back on the " brink of that abyss . " ) There was even an attempt to defend me : " You have to understand , " Efrati wrote , " the enormous power which Marxism gave simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described in detail the Jewish youths from Polish and Russian villages who traveled to the big cities and great seaports to study the Torah . All this was only to explain the source of the " weakness for Marxism of the semiedu-cated . " It gave him " an apparent key to every riddle , " a simple formula by means of which he was able to stand up to the truly learned , absolved him of the need to examine " a complex real-ity , " and liberated him from the duty of " looking into his own soul " and discovering there " mercy and compassion " and the other human weaknesses which " slow down the wheels of the machine a little but make human life worth living . " " The weakness of the semieducated " ? how furious I was with Efrati when I read those words . The arrogance of the fully educated ! He 'd read one book more than you and that was the end of your right to have an opinion of your own . And what about the total idiots who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken the trouble to write six closely written pages in order to retract a few words of abuse . I remembered the way we had talked at Tel Yosef as friends from youth . Whom did we have but those who spoke our language , those who remembered these  | dry bones when they were still clothed in flesh and sinews ? At the end of fifty years all our quarrels were transformed into lovers ' tiffs . My learned friend was mistaken in me . During that period I never read Marxist literature at all . All my ideas came from my guts . Like the prophet Jeremiah , my bowels cried out and I was pained at the very heart . I made my way like a dog sniffing his path through the territory of bigger and bolder dogs . It never occurred to me to envy those whose learning was superior to mine . They had read one book , I had read another . They looked into encyclopedias , I looked into the faces of my friends . ( For anyone who did not practice what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very most I envied those better at riding a horse than I was , but I outgrew that too . ) To call me a Marxist ! A mistake of that order could only be made by a man who could not see a butterfly in a field without sticking a pin in it . If he had called me importunate , a utopian too impatient for heaven on earth to wait for the coming of the Messiah , he would not have been too far off the mark . But a Marxist ! In those days ! The amateur philosophers of the Kuznetsk beit midrash  --  our hut could lay claim to this proud title as long as Kurakin and Epstein were with us  --  indulged in a little " Marxism " too on their beds at night , when they were not discussing other weighty matters , such as the immortality of the soul already mentioned , or the more pressing question of what to do when the thin soup was dished out in order to arrive at the vat at exactly the moment when the barley began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more obdurate than Efrati . Some said that it was all stuff and nonsense , opium for the masses , a bait for fools , and the like ; others treated it with more respect . If luminaries in the West , who were at liberty to shake this loathsome object off the hem of their garments with impunity , wrote learned dissertations about it and gave it a place in their universities , there must be a core of truth in it . And it was only in our country , as usual , that the wheat was separated from the chaff  | and ground : the flour was hoarded in the government storehouses and the chaff was dished out to the masses . There was also a Trotskyite there , who took up arms in passionate defense of Marxism . Marx 's contribution was incomparable . But when his teachings were taken over by idiots , they vulgarized it . Human history was paved with lofty ideas polluted by coarse hands . Kurakin argued characteristically that Marxism had failed because it had no answers to transcendental questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who needed something to believe in , read it like a prayerbook . Epstein said it was like a manna that allowed everyone to taste in it what he wished . Some adhered to it because it was clear and lucid ; others , because it seemed to them cruel and manly . It treated people as they deserved , like frogs swollen with pride who imagined that they had created the swamp with their croaking . And from this point of view the Soviet government was faithful to its method . If thirty-five years after the revolution they had to keep Kurakin and myself in prison , then they really did n't have any faith in human beings ; the conditions of production were intended solely to protect people from the wickedness of their own hearts and make sure that they were in the right place at the right time . In any case , the late Marx , of sainted memory , would turn over in his grave if he could see this brand of communism , which in skipping the stage of capitalism , in taking a shortcut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to industrialize , electrify , and arm the first motherland in which the proletariat , unluckily for it , had gained a dictatorship . For a time we also had with us the well-known physicist Kaplan , who was later released and appointed the head of a scientific institute at Leningrad University . He did not take part in the general debate . But when the three of us , Epstein , Kaplan , and I , were alone together , he said : " I 'm not well up in it . The little I have read seems to me clear and enlightened . Of one thing I 'm sure  --  if it 's a tool in their hands , it ca n't be a science . They ca n't bend physics and mathematics to their wills . " And then Epstein coined his anti-Marxist battle cry : " Socialism must be returned from science to utopia. " p 201 * * * The next day Olga asked me what I thought of the letters . She said that letters revealed only a tiny fraction of the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's letter to read . I reassured her . Efrati 's letter had not upset me at all . If my own personality was not reflected in it , Efrati 's was . A thinker of his kind fails to see important details . He forgot to mention that for two whole years I went barefoot . This was not the first time that I went through the literary remains of a son , in a hopeless attempt to conjure up his image from letters and notes , I said to Olga , and told her about Yefim . After his death his stepfather sent me a little suitcase with the things he had left behind . In it I found a few souvenirs , letters from girls , decorations , and pieces he had written for the Komsomol paper . I read these pieces over and over again , and instead of becoming clearer , his image grew increasingly blurred . The pieces were shallow , naive , full of cliches , without any individual style , as if they were newspaper clippings pasted in the notebook of a hero-worshiping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their heroes by the worst of the Socialist Realist writers during the darkest Soviet periods . Nevertheless , after I had thought it over again and again , I managed to draw a certain encouragement from these articles . If a person as purehearted as Yefim , a simple , noble youth , had believed in all these well-worn , banal phrases , there must be a core of truth in them . Perhaps there was still hope . Perhaps reform was still possible . For in this immense nation there were vast spiritual resources waiting to be discovered , waiting for a new beginning . Perhaps men would fall on the necks of their neighbors again , innocent as children , ready to destroy everything and rebuild it all from scratch . Olga listened in silence , and when I had finished she said in a quiet , hurt voice : " You use words incorrectly . Try not to say remains . ' " As long as he 's alive , " said Olga , " we must n't lose hope . " I was ashamed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence , detached from us , processes beyond our  | comprehension might be taking place . Perhaps there was a light on in some cellar in the building shrouded in darkness . The story about Yefim disturbed Olga . She made a calculation and found that he was born when she was six years old . In other words , he had been conceived in the period immediately prior to my arrest . Which meant that Galina Nikolayevna was not the friend of a prisoner far from home , the succorer of a human wreck , but a Moscow mistress right in the middle of the time which seemed to her , on looking back , like the family 's golden age . She was surprised at herself for not remembering domestic quarrels , and she was even more surprised when I said that she could n't possibly have remembered anything of the sort , since there were no quarrels to remember . Not even one . " In other words , mother did n't suspect anything ? " " I suppose not , " I said . I was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have held her peace . She had made a fuss over far more subtle things , things as insubstantial as the morning mist . Even before there were words to express them , they were already on the agenda . Often I could n't even understand what it was that had disturbed her . The most fleeting shade of feeling would be examined as seriously as if our lives depended on knowing what we had felt , and why , and if we had told each other all that had been felt , in the right words , and at the proper time , and not hidden anything  --  out of fear , carelessness , or inarticulateness . She always urged me to define what I felt toward her . Always . " You can trust me . I 'd rather hear something disagreeable than think that you lied to me to spare me pain . I , for example , trust you completely . And I never hide anything from you . For example , last night , when I felt revolted , I told you . Did n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you knew how to appreciate it . And you knew , too , that it was nothing to get excited ab out . A woman is a very , very complex creature . One day she feels revulsion , the next day the opposite . " Olga agreed with me . She was only a little girl , of course , five years old . But if there was tension in the house she would surely p 203 have sensed it . Small children see things . See and remember . Even if they only understand years later what they saw . But afterward a doubt crept into her heart . She recalled how Nina had " rubbed me out " after my arrest , as if I had never existed . " Did she say anything , anything that might imply ... " I groped . " No , " said Olga . " But not all my questions were answered . " " Was she angry ? " " No , firm . " Children can take a hint , she explained . She did n't understand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask a lot of questions . She would n't be answered . And there would be unpleasantness . And so she soon stopped asking . When she was a little older , she interpreted her mother 's silence as a sign of the times . In the homes of her friends it was the same . The moment the father was arrested , they stopped talking about him . As if he had never existed . Many did not shrink from outright lies : daddy 's dead , mommy 's divorced , daddy ran away with another woman , to another town ; sometimes there was no better way to protect the children from upsetting questions at school or in the new neighborhood they had moved to . Olga had never discussed the subject with her mother . She decided that she understood her motives and respected her silence . In any case , she , too , never spoke about me . Only once she was obliged to lie . At her new school the teacher insisted that she write a curriculum vitae . Olga wrote that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody asked any questions . After a time she was no longer sure that it was n't the truth . She convinced herself that she had n't lied at all . It was the middle of the war , and she was already eleven years old . She asked her mother if she knew what had become of her father . And her mother said : No , nothing is known . We can only hope that the worst has n't happened . " And she did n't show you my letters ? " " Letters ? What letters ? "  | " I wrote to your mother . And I always added a line or two to you as well , in whatever space was left . " " We never received any letters . " " How can that be possible ? Your mother even answered some of my letters . " After a moment 's thought I corrected myself : maybe she did n't actually answer them . She wrote letters and sent them through the appropriate authorities . I could n't remember if they had contained any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her if she had ever heard the expression " enemy of the people . " Olga was surprised that I should even ask such a question . Of course . That was what they called every second person that was arrested . Me , too . But she had n't believed it . When she was five years old , of course , she did n't know what it meant . She only knew that it was a term of abuse , a swear word . But when she was ten , and able to understand the meaning of the concept , she refused to believe that her father was really one of them . Why ? Because he was her father . And could she understand the reason today ? In any case , she remembered that she had n't believed it . But perhaps she was confusing the dates . At the time in question she was probably already sure that her father was dead . And then I asked her if she remembered my visit , after the war broke out . " What visit ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't remember . " You remember so many details , and precisely that visit , a short , unhappy , tense visit . . . precisely that you do n't remember . . . She definitely did n't remember . A total blank . " I was on my way from jail to my army induction , somewhere near Leningrad . I had a four-hour leave , to see my family . It took me two hours to find your mother . Then we went to the creche . I was wearing a green military tunic and I had a gun . ... Now do you remember ? " p 205 Olga narrowed her eyelids . A flicker appeared in her eyes . But she said nothing . " I tried to pick you up in my arms , but you would n't let me ... I suppose I must have stunk terribly .... Four weeks traveling , without washing , without changing my clothes . . . . Afterward we wanted to leave , your mother and I , and you held on to your mother 's dress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You cried dreadfully . . . not like a child . . . a grown-up crying . . . like a hysterical young girl . Forgive me , I remember how hurt I was by that weeping . As if God knows what this terrible man was going to do to your mother if she went with him .... " Olga said : Just a minute . I can remember only one visit to the creche . Of course I remember . It was the only time mother came in the middle of the day . She came with some relation of the family  --  then all relations were called uncle ' . . . and he fell on me with kisses ... " " Uncle ! " " Uncle . Mother came in and said : Here 's a soldier-uncle who wants to see you . Say hello nicely and then he 'll go away . ' " " And still , you would n't let us go . " " I hardly saw mother in those days . " " And you did n't know me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second that that man was my father . " I made a rapid calculation . She was about five when I was arrested . A baby . When I came back she was ten . A girl . And I must have changed , too , during my imprisonment . I tried to remember details . Did she say " father " ? Did I say , " Come to me , ( laughter " ? Did Nina say anything ? This probing in the chaos of my mind failed to produce results . I only remembered that she was reserved , withdrawn , and at parting  --  actually hostile . And that I was insulted . But I was n't angry with her . I was angry with others , with those who had incited her against me . It was n't only my wish to be alone with Nina that had pressed me to cut the meeting short . I could n't stand the glassy way the child was looking at me.  | " I ca n't believe that your mother would be capable of it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger ... " " She probably wanted to spare me the shock . A sudden meeting , and then a long separation again , and even ... " And she had no fears that the child would know me ? Apparently not . I remembered my face : bearded , thin , tortured , the eyes burning with a strange fire . I even looked peculiar to myself . And afterward she even had the nerve to rebuke me for considering my lust more important than the child 's happiness . " And did n't you ask who this uncle was ? Why he came ? And where he suddenly disappeared to ? And why you had to see him in the middle of the day ? And why he fell on you with kisses ? " " As far as I remember  --  no . We never mentioned the meeting again . I was a well-trained little girl . I knew that life was full of secrets and that it was better not to ask questions which had no answers . In the end all the riddles would be solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . " Last night Nina called . She asked for me . Her voice was calm . As if we had spoken to each other only the day before and there was something she had forgotten to say . The Polish accent was still there . And the melody too . Only the beat , it seemed , was slower . She said she had heard about Nimrod 's accident . And she felt the need to say a few words . She knew of similar cases in which people had recovered completely . Afterward she asked after my health and how I was bearing up under the heat . Small talk . And then I asked her if we could meet . Nina paused . As if she was waiting for the sound of my voice to die away . Then she said : Why not ? I 'll try to come to Tel Aviv . And she asked for Olga again . And Olga said yes , yes , yes a few times . I did n't dare ask what had been arranged . I , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not told , I do n't ask . I go over and over her words in my head , like a boy after a first lovers ' meeting . Every word with its secret signals . What she p 207 really wanted to say . What had prevented her from saying it . What she wanted to hear . Perhaps she was trying to hint at something . It was hard for me to imagine her in her world . It would have been easier to see myself in her position , returning to the faith of our fathers . My parents had believed in it , unquestioningly . What they had received from their own parents , they had tried to pass on to their children . They were simple Jews . With God in their hearts . My mother would n't have been able to live for a single day without God . She would have gone mad with fear . My father 's God was a benevolent Jew . He did n't mind if people did n't believe in Him . Sooner or later they would need Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He only pitied us for being godless in a world so full of cruelties . But Nina ! She had been brought up with her mother 's milk to hate the benighted " deniers of the light . " Her father was proud of his enlightened atheism . He held religious rituals in contempt , mocked priests and rabbis , waged a sacred war on superstition . And she , how she had worshiped that handsome man , with the lion 's mane crowning his sculptured head ! For Nina to have thrown in her lot with a crowd of intolerant fanatics , who regarded women as inferior creatures , and damned anyone who thought differently from themselves .. . I could n't imagine this sensuous woman , who smiled to herself in secret when she caught anyone looking at her , who loved wearing fine clothes  --  even in Via Nova , where the cultivation of external appearances was regarded with a certain severity , she had managed to give her rags a fanciful air , as if she were dressed up for a Purim party  --  covering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding her elegant body behind their widow 's weeds . From Olga 's stories it appeared that she was strictly observant , in small matters as in great . Was it for love of this man of hers , who despised himself for needing her body ? Or was it the security of coming to anchor in a safe harbor at last ? I would n't be surprised . How much suffering she had known . How frail she must have become over the course of the years . Those who have  | endured much need a code to conform to . With God or without Him . As long as they are not left to their own devices and obliged to find the answers in their own hearts . They need someone who has the answer to every question . A wise man who knows what is permitted and what is forbidden . Where the borderline lies between good and bad . How to cleanse what has been polluted . About her stepfather Olga said hardly a word . Perhaps her sense of honor stopped her . My curiosity had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made a nuisance of herself , he treated her with exemplary fairness . He never denied her anything . He tried to make her happy . When they lived in Bnei Brak his presence in the house was hardly felt . He spent all day with his students , in another place . In Jerusalem he had a study in the apartment , lined with books from floor to ceiling . But she rarely crossed its threshold . Except when she helped her mother to dust the precious books . When she was at the girls ' boarding school , she hardly ever came home . Then he would sit her down in his study , on the other side of the book- and paper-laden desk , and ask her about her studies . But he never showed much interest in her replies . In any case , it was a matter of no importance to him . He had firm opinions about the kinds of things a woman should know . He never kissed her or stroked her hair , and he seemed to go out of his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise his voice . Not to her or to Nina . He never needed to . A look was enough . Like Rabbi Shimon ben Zakkai , his eyes consumed and annihilated . And her mother obeyed . One thing astonished me . The man was not a Zionist , and in Germany he had applied for a visa to America . They had come to Israel because their application had been turned down . Not because of him , but because of Nina . Olga could n't explain why they had been so strict with them . Other rabbis had been granted visas . " Maybe it was because the name Minkovsky was known to them , " she surmised . " Minkovsky ? " " Yes . That was the name mother wrote on her D.P. identity card . "  | " But why ? " " It never occurred to me to ask , " said Olga . " I thought that that was how she was registered in the documents . " Was her need to wipe out all traces of me so overpowering ? ( ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's eyes . " Perhaps she told him that you were born out of wedlock ? " I wondered aloud . " Why should she have ? " " So that he would n't worry about whether I was dead or alive . " " Mother was sure that you had been killed , " said Olga . The man , Zilberstein , also had a son from a previous marriage . Already grown up then , and today the rabbi of a small congregation in Pennsylvania . There were no children of their own . There had been . Two . A boy and a girl . The first had died a few hours after birth and the second a few weeks after . " There 's a curse on us , " said Nina . And to Olga this was proof that her mother was honestly and truly following in the footsteps of the man she had married . Today I began to " build my house " : I found a drawing table in the basement , Olga bought me drawing instruments and a good pocket computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I 'm not busy working on the translations that bring in a few pennies and give me my freedom of movement , I go down to the basement and draw designs . " All you have to do now is buy a plot of land , " said Walter . It 's apparently not considered in poor taste here to mock the poor . There 's a Chinese proverb which says that the minute a man stops building his house , he begins to dig his grave . A wreath on the grave of the Chinaman , from whom I heard t his proverb . He had no house , nor did anyone dig him a grave . Ile was an old Communist . A member of the Central Committee . He was sent to Moscow to take part in a leadership seminar and accused of espionage . He arrived among us broken and  | bruised , but full of pride . He had not confessed . To what ? Nobody was interested . The rebellion against tyranny had already taken on abstract dimensions . In Moscow he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would sit for hours motionlessly contemplating a stone or a bush . As if he could reconstruct his motherland from a single branch , like the Chinese artist practicing painting a feather all his life long , so that when he reaches the evening of his days he will be able to paint a rooster . His eyes would freeze , as if he had stopped time . His whole life in this one minute . All the storms of time contained within his silence . The whole of the vegetable and animal kingdom in a single blade of grass . The Chinese believe that a single stone contains the cosmos , just as the Jews believe that a single individual contains the world and the fullness thereof . Another proverb that he liked quoting was : " Whatever you have learned is not yours until you have taught it to others . " The lesson of his life . He believed that one day he would return to China to teach others what he had seen on the way from Canton to Norilsk . He dropped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one stopped . Somebody hesitated , and a shot was fired over his head . We went on marching with slow and heavy steps . " One Chinaman less , " someone said . " At this very minute another ten thousand are being born . " A rough joke instead of a tear . Because the Chinaman was well liked . Walter glanced at my sketches and admired them . I had taught myself draftsmanship , I told him . In the camp library you could find all kinds of obsolete textbooks . In this way I had learned architecture , structural engineering , draftsmanship , and the history of music . One thing we never lacked there was time , although we worked long hours . " You 're wasting your talents here , " Zina Shaverin once said to me in the kitchen at Tel Yosef . The girls used to cook soup in a huge pot on a wood-fired p 211 stove . Whenever they had to fill the pot with water , they would stand it under the tap next to the stove , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two strong men to lift it up and put it on the stove . One day I was summoned to perform this task . I poured the water out of the pot , went to the cowshed and fetched a rubber pipe , attached it to the tap , lifted the empty pot onto the stove , inserted the mouth of the pipe into the pot , and the clays of hard labor were over . Zina Shaverin looked at me admiringly . " You 'll be an engineer one day , " she said . " I 'm just lazy , " I retorted . At the same time , however , I was reinforced in the conviction that I had found my vocation . A number of years were to pass before I succeeded in enrolling in a formal course of study , but the school that taught me the most was my incurable tendency to claim to know things that I actually did not know . Once burned , twice shy . After enduring an initial period of " general labor " ? chopping down trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor which few of those unfortunate enough to spend long periods at survived  --  I did everything in my power to get out of it . I was n't exactly proud of the tricks to which I sometimes had to resort to land up in the clinic , or next to the engineers ' desk , or in the spare-parts stores instead , but no better way of staying alive was available to me . I can console myself with the thought that I took care of others too . It was not only myself that I saved from the giant mill of " general labor . " However , this method  --  taking on tasks that I was not qualified to perform  --  often entailed the laborious acquisition of knowledge not easy to come by in the conditions of the camp . Luckily for me , I never got into trouble . I remember one incident when I was nearly caught redhanded . A diesel engine broke down and there was no mechanic available . I volunteered to fix it . I was then working in timber felling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance to take a few days ' rest . I had only the dimmest of notions of the workings of a diesel engine . I went  | over to it , with the camp commander at my heels . I looked the machine over with an expert eye while my heart quailed within me . An obsolete model , I stated . Nobody makes them anymore . Perhaps we can find some old manual lying around . The order was given and soon I was in possession of a detailed instruction manual . Within the space of few hours I had learned , the hard way , all I needed to know . I was given an assistant , too , a chap whose knowledge of diesel engines exceeded mine by far , but who was afraid of being punished if he did n't succeed in getting it back into working order . In the same way I learned mining engineering and bridge construction . Who knows , perhaps at this very moment , somewhere in one of the camps , a work by a contemporary Dostoevsky is brewing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who risks his life at an engineer 's drawing table . In any case , from those days on I have been possessed by a lust for learning . I study everything that I can lay my hands on . I have never wiped myself before reading the piece of paper on both sides . As soon as I have the time , I intend learning electronics . My ignorance in this field makes me feel that I 'm fifty years behind the times . I found a thick volume in English here . Which leaves me no alternative but to polish up the English I learned from the British spy in the Vladimir jail . Nina kept her promise . A few days after her call she came to Tel Aviv . There is something I have to confess . The details of my conversation with Nina are recorded on a magnetic tape . Without her knowledge I recorded them . So that I would be able to listen to them later . I was n't sure that she would come again . It took a lot of cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice during the course of the conversation . But she did n't notice anything . The preoccupation with a side issue , worrying about the hidden tape recorder , stealthy glances at the hand on the dial to check if the volume was right  --  all this helped me to maintain  | some sort of pretense at composure . Later on , when I played the tapes back , I did not find much of interest in them . Nothing of significance was said . But there was great power in what was left unsaid . And the voice , of course , that deep , melodious voice , which even the cheap tape could not flatten . Nina did not have to make an effort to maintain her composure . I admire her self-control . She looked right into my eyes without batting an eyelash . As if prompted by some sudden curiosity . Her eyes were as big and astonishingly beautiful as ever . But there was a new firmness in them . As if she wanted to warn me not to make a fool of myself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no deep lines in it . Her figure too was remarkably well preserved . I was glad to see that she had seen fit to dress up as elegantly as if she were going to the opera in my honor . But Olga said that she always dressed up when she went out . Like a fashionable matron from some other time and place . Her blue-gray hair fitted her head as closely as a helmet . Maybe it was her own hair . My outstretched hand was left empty . A strange man . I had n't forgotten . But I thought that God would have forgiven her if she had let herself go and allowed herself to touch the past . Olga stayed with us for a few minutes and then left the room . With her departure a chill descended . The words that came out of Nina 's mouth were emptier than silence . She asked about Nimrod , with an appropriately mournful expression on her face . She asked about my health and said we should thank the Good Lord that we were alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear any complaints . She asked if there was anything I needed , and when I said I did n't need anything , an expression of genuine happiness crossed her face , for the first and only time . She looked radiant with health and serenity . What she wanted to say was conveyed in the tone of her voice . Her voice , as musical as a tender Russian melody , succeeded in transmitting one clear , unequivocal message : as far as she was concerned , I was buried outside the cemetery fence . I could only admire the way in which she gave me to under-  | stand that she was not interested in hearing about what I had been through without her , and that she would be grateful if I did not ask her any questions about her own life either . She said : Lately one hears so many stories from people coming back from Siberia , and they 're all the same . I could not forgive her for refusing the refreshments offered her by Olga  --  fresh fruit , tea , and cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . Her own daughter 's dishes unclean ? But I imagined that she was being so scrupulous in order to underline her message . The mountain looming between us towered to great and terrible heights . We were separated not only by time and distance , but by customs and mores , prohibitions and taboos , pile upon pile of punctilious religious observances . A whole culture . ( I remembered my father and mother . They too were observant Jews . But without false pride and arrogance , without anger against the " lawless . " Only sorrow . They too tried to observe as many of the 613 mitzvahs in the Torah as possible . But the concept of " mitzvah , " although it came from the same root as " command , " was applied by them only to such precepts as were not compulsory . And it seems to me that this is so in popular usage too . Only what is beyond the strict line of the law is a mitzvah . All the rest is compulsory , and taken for granted . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain priority over the other positive mitzvahs , their God would surely have given them to understand that they were permitted to eat an apple offered them by their daughter . ) Without noticing , we began to talk Russian . The Russian language introduced a certain gentleness into her words . Even the expression on her face changed . The pursed lips , the lips of an offended child , softened . Her Russian was old-fashioned . The suffixes were too soft . She sounded as if she was reciting . How everything has changed , I thought . Us , the world , even the words . As if they were bowed down by the burden of memories which are no longer shared . In the middle of the conversation , Olga 's son suddenly p 215 came into the room , our soldier grandson . He greeted us politely and went out again . Nina said , " What a charming gentle-man . " And for a few minutes I was aglow with fatuous joy . I thought that she used the word " gentleman " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a certain polite monkey in the Izmailovi Zoo that we used to call " the gentleman " in reference to some lines of Chodasevicz that we were fond of reciting : I have shaken the hands of beautiful women and poets And leaders of the nation ; not one of them Was as aristocratic in every line ! Not one of them touched my palm With so brotherly a touch ! And God 's my witness , No human being into my eyes Looked thus , so wisely and profoundly , A look into the fathomless depths of the soul . We would stop at " fathomless depths of the soul " and look into each other 's eyes with limitless love . This foreign word , " gentleman , " in a heavy.Russian accent , was like the seal of a secret pact . Sometimes we rolled it on our tongues in the company of strangers , referring to our love , of which they were ignorant .... But this time , it seemed , the word had slipped out of Nina 's mouth without any intention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to bring up the Izmailovi Zoo . What could I be thinking of ? ! Afterward she told me that she had been so shocked by her father 's execution that she could not speak for a month . It was then that she had made up her mind to return to Poland . It was in 1944 , and everyone predicted that after the war Poland would he under Russian influence . She hoped that they would open the Ix ) rders and allow her to return to the land of her birth . I found it strange that she should see fit to tell me this . It amounted , after all , to an admission that she had had no intention of waiting for me . I said nothing . What did it matter now  | exactly when she had decided to break off relations with me ? Suddenly she asked me about Galina Nikolayevna and Yefim . I was very surprised . I had no idea that she knew about the episode in question . The miserable meeting on my way to the front took on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grudge . She had not hesitated to take her revenge on me , even though I was on my way from Siberia to the western front . She had not even thought that I deserved to know what I was being punished for . And she still had the nerve to blame me for not taking the child 's feelings into account . I said nothing . I adopted her own superior attitude toward sins made obsolete by the law of limitations . She spoke about Galina Nikolayevna and Yefim as if they were characters in a story that had nothing to do with her . They were mentioned only in passing , in order to clarify a point : why she had considered that she was entitled to plan her return to Poland without taking me into account . There was a relaxed expression on her face , but she could n't fool me . The tension was apparent in her fingers which were tightly locked together . She was pleased with the way the meeting had gone . She had expected worse . I had not been aggressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for the remark about the monkey in the Moscow zoo , which seemed to her completely out of context . Nina saw that she could rely on me . There was no danger of anonymous letters to her husband from my quarter . Nor did my occupation pose a threat . A translator from Hebrew into Russian was not likely to make a lot of enemies . And nevertheless there was a feeling of unfinished business in the air . The meeting had not solved anything . We had seen each other , learned what had changed , and what had not changed . And so ? We were still tied together by an indissoluble bond . In a moment of goodwill , after we had spoken kindly of departed friends , I asked her : " And now , what ? " For a moment she thought that I wanted to set a date for another meeting . She embarked on a long explanation of all the difficulties in which this would involve her . I cut her short . This was not what I had  | had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her free of me entirely ? As far as I was concerned , I said , this formality did not bother me in the least . But in her world , among the people she knew .. . Nina looked at me coldly . " Our marriage is not valid , " she said . " And there is thus no need for a divorce . " For a moment I was full of rage . " What do you mean , not valid ? Because we never got married according to the Law of Moses and Israel ? " " Yes . " " In other words , from their point of view you are permitted even to a Cohen . . . and I simply never existed at all ? " My irony made no impression on her . But when I added , " In that case , why was it necessary to sweep me under the rug ? " she tensed , although she held her tongue . " Until you learned the laws you must have entangled yourself in a pretty web of lies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that grew more indifferent from one moment to the next . " And why should I have lied ? " " So that people would think you were a widow . To avoid complications . To be on the safe side . " " I never lied . I was certain that you had been executed , " she said calmly . " You were certain ? ... " " I even saw a certificate confirming it . " " A certificate ? Who could have shown you any such certifi-cate ? " " Leopold . " " The Pole ? " I never succeeded in getting to the bottom of Leopold Sherrer . He was the editor of a Polish journal . A tall , frail man with  | sparse hair and skinny arms , and exceptionally refined manners . Interested in Yiddish literature , he would visit the editorial office , rummage about in the archives , and engage in polemics with the poets . Once he came down to the printing press to look for something . Since we had already met at Minkovsy 's , we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit to drop in to visit me . We became friends  --  to the extent that it was possible to make friends with a stranger in those suspicious days . He flattered me , calling me " the philosopher of the lead cauldron . " And this was nothing to be sneezed at , for he himself was a graduate of the Institute of Philosophy . The Polish-speakers were lavish in their praises : his essays on aesthetics were philosophical gems . In the course of time he fell into the habit of accompanying me home . He would kiss Nina 's hand , pat Olga on the head , and take his leave . Nina was truly lovely in those days . Blooming , gay , always excited . If she heard a concert , read a book , saw something in the street  --  she had to share her experiences with others . Leopold Sherrer would listen to her and nod his head . He never flirted with her . He never gave her admiring looks , made ambiguous remarks , or showed her any special deference . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts . He was an inexhaustible font of smoked sausages , rare cheeses , Polish vodka , and theater tickets . But his great love was music . Nina and " the Pole , " as they called him at the paper , found a common language . He always succeeded in obtaining tickets to popular concerts which we could never have afforded on our own . Here the nobility of the man made itself apparent . He made a point of inviting us both , turn by turn . Since he was a bachelor , he always had an extra ticket . I was not naive . I suspected that he was in love with Nina . And that he only invited me as a cover for his true feelings . But I had no fears on his score . Nina , who respected his knowledge and enjoyed his company , could never have fallen in love with someone like him . He was too smooth and smarmy , and he talked too much , she said . But as an escort to a concert , he was p 219 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open book to me . Her integrity and her arrogance would never allow her to become involved in a trivial love affair with a conceited peacock . I noted , too , that he always took care to bring her home straight after the concert . They never stayed out to eat . He would bring the delicacies back with him and the three of us would feast together . The two of us , actually . He would lecture , analyze the performance , the music , its period , etc. ? and we would guzzle . My musical knowledge was extremely limited . But there was no other form of entertainment available : Perhaps I also did it to annoy  --  I never once gave up my turn . He would escort me in style to Tchaikovsky Hall , where he had countless acquaintances , to whom he would always introduce me as the best of his friends . He included me in their learned conversations as if I were one of them . I was repelled by his sentimentality and the highfalutin tone of his speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes he would waste his most brilliant ideas on my deaf ears . I imagined that he expounded them to Nina , too . I was presumably the audience for the dress rehearsal . I remember , once he took me to a chamber concert . A Schubert quintet . The music was exquisite  --  there 's no denying that . Quiet and moving , filling the soul with good intentions . But I could see no cause for tears . In Moscow , in 1936 , there were plenty of good reasons to weep . Anyone who had survived that crossing with dry eyes had no right to blubber over Schubert . But Leopold Sherrer wept like an insulted child . In the intermission he actually sobbed on my shoulder . How noble ! How divine ! And how immoral ! " Immoral ! " I exclaimed . Not that it made any difference to me . But I had to give him an opening . I imagined that he was busy hatching some original idea . And politeness obliged me to help my benefactor put his thoughts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed an accusing finger at the musicians : " How is it possible  --  at a time like this ! In Central Asia ,  | children are dying of starvation . Destitute peasants are roaming the roads . In Siberia , old women are freezing to death . And they sit there and produce otherwordly sounds from their violins . Look at them ! White-breasted ravens . In their black suits , white waistcoats , bow ties . People without a conscience taking pleasure in a strong vibrato , a fine passage . It 's a disgrace ! " And then , as if alarmed at his own words : " The kulaks have only themselves to blame . How is it possible to stop progress ! " But he suffered anyway . " And them with their Stradivarii . Taking bows . Happy . Shame on them ! " " You know what ? " I said to him . " Next time let 's go to the circus . " He patted my shoulder affectionately . " Now I understand why Nina loves you . " In his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew , the philosophy hidden in the lead before it was set into letters . Sometimes I was afraid for him . He talked too much for his own good . To hint at the fate of the kulaks took real boldness . I would n't have dared . But he came out of all the purges unscathed . As far as I know , his journal was the only one in Moscow whose editor remained unchanged for twelve years . He always had money , too , and nobody knew where it came from . Flawlessly dressed , a flower in his buttonhole , his feet shod in twotone black-and-white shoes from abroad , gleaming like the onion domes of St. Basil 's Church on a sunny day . He was a past master at the art of organizing the impossible . He slithered like a worm through the cracks in the bureaucracy and succeeded in penetrating everywhere . He had all kinds of connections : government officials , clergy , artists , Gypsies , spiritualists , stamp collectors . And presumably , in the secret police too . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with him . I was obliged to resign myself to his leechlike friendship . The inevitable fate of a man with a beautiful wife . In any case , if he was close to the authorities , it did n't do us p 221 any harm . His connections were usually exploited to help his friends . Including us . Not only that  --  once he saved me from real trouble . One evening Swersky , a comrade from the Via Nova commune , pounced on me in the street , next to the printing press . He was wild-eyed , disheveled , and confused . He seized me by the arm , with unnecessary force  --  although I had no intention of avoiding him  --  and pulled me into a dark alley . The stupid tricks of a greenhorn . If a policeman had seen us , he would have arrested us both on the spot , without asking any questions . " Is there anywhere where we can talk ? " he whispered in a voice frantic with agitation . " Anywhere at all . " Swersky was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tried to decipher the hidden notes in my voice . Was it simply the complacency of a fool ? They had n't touched me and so I imagined that everything around me was normal . Or perhaps I was one of them myself ? The loud answer was a kind of threat . In another moment the label would be waved in my face , and then the handcuffs : a spreader of slanders . In those days I.really and truly believed that all this was exaggerated . The police were tough  --  so what ? Were we to allow lawless elements to endanger a historical opportunity ? I knew courteous policemen . Minkovsky 's neighbor in the apartment house was a high-up officer , an exemplary family man , discreet and tactful . I had seen a moving film about the beneficial work of the police among homeless youths . I accepted this too  --  that if the job was necessary and I could not do it myself , it was my duty at least to respect those who did . I thought that Swersky was putting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel sorry for him . I imagined that he lacked a pass and was presumably about to ask me for shelter . I felt harassed and embarrassed . I could n't take him home to our apartment . We were living three in a room . With another family behind the screen . We shared a kitchen with three other families . The caretaker was strict and suspicious . And all the  | residents had agreed not to bring in guests without a general consensus . But I could n't abandon him to his fate either . My conscience would not allow me to reject a man in trouble . Never mind a comrade from Via Nova . " Can we go inside ? " Swersky 's eyes darted about . He bowed his head . He looked over my shoulder and pressed up to me . Like an underground fighter in an old-fashioned Soviet film . With dramatic , heroic gestures . The kiosk was open . I bought him a bottle of buttermilk and an egg sandwich . I poured myself a glass of tea . I wiped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or too far from the counter . I sat him down with a flourish , like a man offering hospitality to a welcome guest . I tried to wipe out the conspiratorial impression with which he had opened our encounter . I hoped that he would not make himself too conspicuous . I tried to create the impression that he was a poor , unknown poet from some remote province , with a friend in the printing press who had promised to help him get his poems published in the paper . But Swersky was too frightened to take any notice of my hints . " And here  --  can we talk ? " He leaned over the table so that his words would reach my ears alone , but his voice came out in a loud , shrill whistle . Luckily for me there were only four or five people in the kiosk , and none of them turned to look at us . " Out with it , for God 's sake ! I do n't remember you as a man who was afraid of his own shadow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me a reproachful look . " Wait until you hear what I have to say . " What he had to say did , indeed , give me a nasty shock . After they had forced the Tatars and Ukrainians on Via Nova , and the commune was no longer what it had been , he had decided to leave . He had wandered from one town to another , doing all kinds of odd jobs and escaping when his lack of papers was discovered . In the end he got sick and tired of this way of life p 223 and decided to infiltrate into Moscow , where he had a number of old friends from Via Nova . He was sure to find a refuge with one of them until he could obtain the necessary papers . But he was wrong . None of them dared to take him in . For a few days he roamed the streets , sleeping in all kinds of strange places , a toy shop storeroom among the woolen bears , movie theaters , a wine cellar , the zoo  --  until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst that could happen would be some form of punishment and deportation back to where he had come from . But things turned out differently . After a week in solitary confinement , he was summoned to an interrogation . Opposite him sat a crude , sharp-tongued brute , who knew Hebrew and Yiddish , and who offered him a deal : in return for helping them to convict Elkind he would be given permission to stay in Moscow . " Convict him ! How ? " " Nothing could be easier , " said Swersky . " And did you agree ? " " What a question ! " " And you 're not ashamed ? " Swersky gave me a half-contemptuous , half-pitying look . " What do you think ? " " What can I think ? " " And what do you think I 've come to ask you for ? Elkind 's address ? " " I do n't know . " " Neither do I. " The whole thing was a mystery to me . But it appeared that they had n't given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned up out of the blue at a confidential address it would make Elkind suspicious . They were planning an apparently chance encounter . The next day they were going to take him to a point nearby soon before the hour that Elkind usually left the house . In the meantime they had given him a twenty-four-hour pass and a bed in a hostel for the night . Presumably in order to persuade him that they kept their promises .  | " And how can I help you ? " " I do n't want to go back to the hostel . " Swersky was looking for a place to sleep for one night . And he also asked me to help him escape from Moscow at dawn . " How ? On foot ? By train ? " " I do n't know yet . I 've come to ask your advice . " At that moment I saw the Pole . He was sitting at the other end of the kiosk and reading a manuscript . He did not appear to have seen us at all . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got up and came to stand next to our table . " You need help , I see . " It was n't a question . It was a statement . Swersky 's shoulders shook . I indicated to him that he could trust the man . But he was not required to repeat his story . Leopold Sherrer did not show the least interest in Swersky . From a distance he had seen that I was upset , and he had come to help me . " You go home , " he said to me . " Nina will be waiting for you . I 'll look after your friend . " I was beside myself with gratitude . " Friends help one another , " he said to me in Polish , of which I knew only a few words . The plan was for Swersky to spend the night at Sherrer 's place , and the next morning the latter would take him in a friend 's car to the Prioberzhanski Market , and from there he would be smuggled out of the city in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transported to a place where nobody knew him . Two days later I met Leopold Sherrer . " Is everything all right ? " He made a circle with his thumb and forefinger . In other words : plain sailing . He intimated that I should n't inquire about the details . The less I knew , the better it would be for me . Swersky never bothered me again . I told Nina that the Pole was a true friend , without going into details . What Sherrer had said applied to her too . Nina agreed with me . In times like these , she said , there were n't many people to whom you could entrust p 225 a secret without fear of betrayal . I would have been happier if she had n't said it . But that was the price I paid for my chivalrous remark . What an idiot I was ! I still did n't understand that I had given myself into his hands , for better or for worse . You have to be a real simpleton , a trusting fool , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after your wife . Even during my interrogation , when I was suddenly asked about Swersky , I still did n't suspect Leopold Sherrer . The police had many ways of finding out what they wanted to know . I could n't believe that he had handed him over to the authorities and then come to me for my thanks . There was no room in my photograph album yet for characters of such duplicity . I thought that if Swersky had been caught because of him , he would presumably have kept out of my way . And in any case , a man who cried at concerts was incapable of doing anything so wicked . Today I know better . Nina 's story cleared up the episode at the printing press . And not only that . Many mysteries were il-luminated . A new light was shed on acts , gestures , words . And everything connected up into one web . The man who was capable of producing a death certificate for someone who was still alive had presumably had no hesitations about clearing his path to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I try to understand how Nina knew about my love affair with Galina Nikolayevna , I can only assume that here too Leopold Sherrer played a part . We were so careful that even Galina 's closest friends knew nothing about me . Not because of any prudishness on Galina 's part . She was a free woman and had no reason to hide anything . It was purely out of scrupulousness and respect for Nina 's honor that Galina agreed to the underground conditions which weighed heavily on her heart . I too shared her distress , but I could not make up my mind  --  up to now Nina , and from now on  | Galina . In my heart of hearts I knew that this was not the kind of abyss into which a man casts himself with his eyes closed . More than this love existing in its own right , it was a cure for a wound . A scratch that Nina 's nail had unknowingly made in my soul . One day I would be cured and I would have no further need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the fact that the man she loved bestowed his favors on her . It is reasonable to assume that she did not boast of this poor gift . There was every reason to believe that our secret was well kept . And nevertheless , there was someone who knew . Someone who had access to confidential documents read gossip in them too . Detectives never dismiss even the smallest crumb of information . Affairs of the heart , too , are conscientiously filed away . You can never know when they might come in useful . In the absence of weightier evidence , the prosecution could always argue that a man who betrayed his wife was likely to betray his country as well . One night , after a concert , Sherrer forced an intimate conversation on me . He usually avoided this . A minefield . A man who is in love with your wife does not chatter about women or use obscenities in your presence . This time , however , under the cover of the darkness , he saw fit to warn me . Rumors of relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the ears of the Party . Although it was none of the Party 's business , of course , it would be wise to be careful . Flighty characters were not to be trusted . And if I had any ambitions  --  it might do me harm . A friendly word of advice . He spoke like a civilized man of the world . Without a trace of self-righteous reproach , without any cant about " taking advantage of an innocent girl " or similar cliches . He spoke politely and matter-of-factly . He remarked that he could understand me ? a man who was married to " the perfect woman " was liable to feel a " primal urge " for the society of an " ordinary mortal , " to see if he was capable of " giving , too , and not only receiving .... " But nevertheless . We had to remember that " society judged p 227 us in its own terms . . . It did not pardon what a man pardoned himself . . . . " And similar enlightened remarks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the insult to Nina . As if to imply that a superior creature like Nina could not be hurt by a nonentity like me . Just as God is not insulted if people do n't believe in Him . He worshiped her to such an extent ! Now that I recall that conversation , I understand its purpose . Clearly , he had no intention of " warning " me so that I would mend my ways . I could have drowned in a bog for all he cared . But in his scenario there was no room for inconsequential events . The philosopher in him was delighted to see how one thing led to another , with not even a single gesture made in vain . He knew that I would soon be arrested . He intended telling Nina that I had another woman . The timing too was shrewdly chosen . A few days after the arrest , as something which had been disclosed during the course of interrogation . By then it was no secret that he had connections in those quarters . If Nina took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would not suspect him of giving me away . He had specifically said that " rumors had reached the Party . " In other words , people knew and there was gossip . As for the man who had taken the trouble to warn me in confidence  --  he would be the last one I would suspect of betraying my secret to my wife . Why should it have mattered to him if I trusted him or not ? People come back from jail . And what if they failed to convict me of espionage ? He might need my friendship one day . In the Russia of those days no one made enemies if he could help it . You never could tell . Fortunes were liable to change overnight . If Nina reacted in the way he expected  --  in other words , realized that her scruples were unjustified and felt that she was no longer bound to a convict who was unworthy of her  --  so much the better . His warning would only reflect credit on him . He had given me a chance , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had tried to save a family from ruin and I had not taken his advice . After he had given it , there was a long silence .  | " If you 're angry with me for interfering in your affairs , I apologize . Forget everything I 've said , " said Sherrer and put his hand placatingly on my shoulder . " I 'm not in the least angry , " I said . " On the contrary , I thank you for your frankness . But what can I do ? I do n't think I can break off relations brutally , from one day to the next . Love affairs of this kind usually come to an end of their own accord as soon as some obstacle crops up ... " " Love that collapses the moment it encounters an obsta-cle , " said Sherrer , mimicking my voice , " is not love . " I did not realize then that it was himself he was talking about . The next day I brought the subject up in conversation with Olga . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked her . " I think I 've already told you . All over the place  --  a week here , a month somewhere else . Until we received the permit to go to Poland we did n't have a permanent place to stay . " " And the permit  --  did you obtain it without difficulty ? " " Without difficulty ? Nothing was done without difficulty in those days . You had to beg and plead , run around , look for influential friends to plead your case for you ... " " After they shot your grandfather you still had influential friends ? I 'm surprised to hear it . " And then Olga remembered the Pole . She could n't remember his name . But it was enough for me . " Yes , there was some Pole who helped us a lot . " As she spoke she remembered that for a while they had even lived in his apartment . And when they went to Poland , he accompanied them to the border . Olga was displeased when I asked her " what kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pole . " How should she know ? She was a child of twelve , and if there had been any intimate connection they must have done all they could to conceal it from her . Girls of that age can be very spiteful . Although she had n't been in the least inquisitive then . She was p 229 glad to have a roof over her head and food to eat , and she had n't troubled herself about where they came from . " They did n't take me into their confidence , " she said with a trace of irony . " As far as I remember they did n't behave like a married couple . They hardly ever went out together . And when there were visitors , mother ( you know her ) behaved as if the apartment belonged to us and he was some kind of servant or janitor ... " But after a moment she remembered that the man had not " accompanied them to the border , " as she had previously stated , but had intended coming with them to Warsaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . Everything was so strange . At the border station two policemen entered the carriage . After glancing at our papers , they asked him to come with them . A formality , he would be right back , they said to mother . They were very polite . But he did n't come back . The train left without him . His luggage remained with us . " " And mother ? How did she react when he did n't come back ? " " The questions you ask ! " said Olga . " How do you expect me to remember ? I was occupied with myself . With leaving Russia . With escaping from the people who had killed grandfather and caused grandma 's death . I could n't wait to be in Warsaw , which mother had described as a paradise on earth . If you could have seen that paradise ! " For a moment she was overwhelmed by her memories . " Funny that I do n't remember mother 's reaction at all . Do you think that he was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious disappearance of the Pole affected her , she must have done her best to prevent me from sensing anything . You know what she 's like . She can be soft and gentle . But in moments of risis she 's as hard as flint . " I low strange to think that so large a part in the events that overwhelmed our lives in those years was played by the schemes of one man , who coveted my wife .  | But when I think of his sweet smile , of the sly twinkle in his sharp eyes , which were always fixed on some imaginary spot at the top of your forehead , I believe that he was capable of it . He was clever , elusive , cunning as a devil , and he enjoyed fishing in deep waters He was in love with dramatic gestures and with plotting true-life dramas in the role of a character acting behind the scenes . The Polish journal was only a cover . He had a secret role that enabled him to play whatever part he wished in other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to his character and his talents . The era in question has been given many names . Some have characterized it as chaos , some as a time of Sturm and Drang , and others as the beginning of a bureaucratic hardening of the arteries . The " cult of the personality " was blamed . As opposed to these , there were some who saw it as the crashing of utopia on the rocks of reality . In either event , necessary evil and natural evil found a wide scope for their activities in it . And in any case , it was a time which prepared the ground for people like him to grow and flourish . A belated pain pierced my mind as it suddenly occurred to me that perhaps they had only remained in their seats in Tchaikovsky Hall until the intermission . . . . And they had heard the other half of the concert in his room , over the radio , in one another 's arms . . . . They had dressed themselves hastily to the sounds of the final chords , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at our apartment a few minutes after the end of the concert . And afterward he would sit modestly at the little table in the hall , drinking glass after glass of tea , and speak with great knowledge and profound emotion about music , orchestras , conductors . . . . With the finest , most delicate distinctions . He could speak for two hours at a stretch about the popular motifs in baroque music without repeating the same idea once .... What made me so sure that she was incapable of loving a man like him ? Because he was frail and soft ? Perhaps that was what attracted her . He was sensitive , intelligent , and refined . She  | already had a he-man in bed . What she presumably lacked were caressing words , enchanting , lubricating words , intimate words that touched the heart . All I could talk about were things that you could design and construct . I must have bored her to tears . I remember the bored look she gave me when I boasted to her of refusing the post in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain for me . " I did n't return to Russia to sit in an office , " I said to her . " I want to be a worker . To build socialism with my own hands . " " You 're studying engineering , " she said , " and that 's a kind of office job too . " The closest things to poetry that I ever said were said then . In passionate words I described to her the feelings of a man who draws something on a piece of paper and a few years later walks over it to cross a seething river . The most beautiful thing in the world , in my eyes , was a suspension bridge . At that moment she almost loved me . I never brought her flowers , as he did , except on the day that Olga was born . I could n't drop the names , as he did , of musicians , actors , poets , and ballet dancers met the night before at the theater , or lunched with at a restaurant ... . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that on the day of my arrest , when all our friends and acquaintances shunned our home as if we had the plague , he was the only one who came to sympathize and console . His courage did not go unappreciated . The Polish language should erase with loathing from its vocabulary the hypocritical words he said to her then , his hand resting , with affection and respect , on her shoulder . I suppose he was careful not to touch her breast , this time , out of respect for her sorrow . . . . As long as I was in jail in Moscow , when she came to the prison on Thursdays , the day appointed for her visits , Leopold Sherrer accompanied her , our guardian angel .... He wrote our tragedy , and he was constantly there on location when it was filmed . He took the shots , directed , edited , and added a soundtrack of his own .  | Better not to dwell on it . Astonishment and rage at the holy innocence of a decent woman . He brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any questions . She glanced at it , passed the back of her hand over the corner of her eye , and moved into his apartment . Maybe she needed comfort . A few weeks earlier her father had made an impassioned protest . The Red Army was standing by while the Germans slaughtered the Poles rising up against them in Warsaw . They gave him a quick trial . A veteran Communist , a candidate for the leadership , was taken out and shot like a common crook . Her mother killed herself soon after . Perhaps Nina needed to weep in her mother tongue . I was an unimportant bit player in the drama of her life . A death certificate wiped me out . Her sins were washed white as snow . The man who had stood by her side at the worst moments of her life deserved a reward for his devotion . Her past weaknesses received a post factum justification in the light of his exalted virtues . What may once have seemed an ignoble surrender to her baser instincts was now transformed into a profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate signed by a rabbi , priest , or judge . It is not completely out of the question that Leopold Sherrer had a hand in the fall of old Minkovsky too . Thus he ensured her dependence on him . There is no proof , however . And there never will be . " Shakespeare could never have written a Soviet tragedy , " Larissa Verchinsky once wrote me . " It would have been beyond the power of his imagination . " She was referring to something else , of course , something private . And she never knew Leopold Sherrer . But she must have come across someone like him in the course of her experience . The power which the Soviet regime bestowed on those who walked in darkness sharpened in their dark souls the kind of cunning and talent for survival required by the intriguing princes of a medieval court . The end of Leopold Sherrer is a chapter in socialist realism . A knave may play a positive role . But he may not be rewarded . He too was only a supporting character in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his hour had come . Poetic justice was done . This far , devil , and no farther ! You satisfied your lust . But there are no happy endings for devils . Politely he was requested to get off the train . The end of the story for you , Comrade Sherrer . A peaceful life in the city of your birth with the woman you love is not written in your stars . In the train , with her daughter , who does not notice anything , Nina makes her exit from Leopold Sherrer 's story with dry eyes . But perhaps I judge her too harshly . Perhaps she was afraid to cry . Poland , too , was ruled by the people who had executed her father . She dared to cry only when she reached Germany . And then she chose to lean on the shoulder of a man who could promise her peace of mind . The peace of waking up in the morning with the taste of foulness in her mouth and saying , " Blessed is He who made me according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ritual bath of boiling water in order to purify herself of the foulness which clung to her when she coupled with the devil . It wo n't be long before I have to leave my daughter 's home and stand on my own feet . I am waiting for a one-room apartment to fall vacant in Finesod House , where , for some reason or other , I have been promised a roof over my head . The Jewish Agency official , Perlmutter , is not forthcoming about the reasons for my good fortune . Finesod House is an old-age home , but only for those still capable of taking care of their own needs . " Fall vacant " is a euphemism . Someone will presumably have to die in order for me to obtain a place of my own . I wish him a good , long life . But I am already becoming impatient . And not because I am not well treated in my daugh-ter 's home . They treat me very well . My mother used to say : " Grandma ' to stay jam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " But we are civilized people and we never fight . Olga suffers all my eccentricities with forbearance . She never  | says That 's not how we do things here . But I always know when she 's thinking it . The young people ignore my existence . I ca n't complain of their manners . It would be unreasonable to expect them to fall in love with me . They do n't understand my language . My accent amuses them and it is to their credit that they do n't burst out laughing in my face . My stories are of no interest to them . They are too young to understand that my trials and tribulations are the history of their lives . Up to the age of twenty a person wants to escape his father 's fate . At the age of forty he understands that his son 's life is bound up with his father 's . At the age of seventy he begins to take an interest in his grandfather . If I could afford to buy them presents , perhaps they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there 's nothing I can give them . Their parents have spoiled them and they lack for nothing . I ca n't complain about Walter either . He behaves toward me now with greater civility . Even the irony that used to infest his voice like a kind of chronic hoarseness sometimes disappears . This too is a mark of civilized behavior  --  to show respect for the sorrow of others . The kinds of sorrow which I suffered in the past are apparently not considered worthy of respect . Perhaps he is incapable of understanding the sorrow of a man whose spiritual world caves in around him . Perhaps he considers that all the calamities that fell to my lot in Russia were only what I deserved . The just deserves of the wicked . As if to say : What right does a disillusioned Communist have to demand sympathy from us , who were never infected by that bug ? In any case , recently he even strikes up a conversation with me from time to time . And one day , when Olga was away , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He spent a vast sum on me , presumably on his expense account . He was in a boisterous , jolly mood . He told the waiters off . Ordered drinks and sent them back . He even talked to himself when he was already a little drunk . I looked at him while he was eating . He raised the plate from the table and shoveled the food into his mouth with quick , short movements . His fork collected all the scraps , scooped them into a lump , and thrust it into his mouth with the deft , careful p 235 movement of a surgeon . I asked him if he had ever been in jail . He gave me an approving look . As if he was suddenly seeing me in a new light . You 've got a perceptive eye , he said . He had been in jail for a short time , during the British Mandate . But his experience of hunger came from a poor kibbutz where he had stayed as a boy , as a ward of Youth Aliyah . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad when I moved out of my room . He had built it like that on purpose  --  isolated , shut off . A corner of his own . A place where he could seclude himself even from his own family , a kind of shrine where Walter Shaefer could do homage to Evyatar Sheffer , remember the days of his poverty , and celebrate his success . Walter was the second son of a Hamburg property owner . In his youth he was apparently recalcitrant . His father did not consider him fit to inherit an economic empire and intended it for his elder brother . There was some kind of quarrel at home and he was sent to Palestine with Youth Aliyah , as if into banishment , to endure hardships , improve his character , and then come back and know how to appreciate his advantages . At that time they were still under the impression that Hitler was a passing phenomenon . In the end nothing was left of the family property . His parents and brother emigrated to the United States , where fortune did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make money . It was his dream to support his father . But in the meantime the War of Independence broke out . And after it was over he stayed on in the regular army . He did well there , but he could not afford to help his father , who was eking out a living as a janitor in a community center . By the time he had left the army and made a fortune , there was no one of his family left to help . On the kibbutz the youths from Youth Aliyah lived four to a room  --  a wooden hut under a blazing tin roof . I could understand the longing for privacy which came into being there . Like my own . In a different place . When I left , his dream would come true . And the sooner the better . With all the sympathy I can feel for him , the less opportu-  | nity we have to rub each other up the wrong way , the better . He may think that disillusionment with the Soviet Union has shown me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forfeited the right to hold any opinions of my own . But what can I do if I am still stubborn enough to insist on voicing an opinion once in a while  --  whether he likes it or not ? Not only that , there are some things which are simply beyond my comprehension . I can not comprehend , for example , how an intelligent person like him , who even reads an occasional book , can believe today , at the beginning of the last quarter of the twentieth century , that the rich are rich by the grace of God . I quickly lose patience when I meet a man who thinks that the status quo is right . When he prattles on about free enterprise and the laws of the market , a shiver runs down my spine . All the sacrifices of my generation were in vain . If I were to tell him that I am not at all sure that every penny in his bank account got there by honest means , even if he did not break the law , he would think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had neither forgotten anything , nor learned anything . I hold my tongue . The silence of a man who eats the bread of charity . As if I were obliged to choose between my views and my family . When I have a place of my own , I will be able to hold on to both . A visit to Tel Aviv . On the way , between the university and the historical museum , among the plastered and whitewashed newlooking brick houses , the greenish wall of an old Arab house suddenly peeped out . A house with arched windows and a big veranda overlooking the Yarkon River . A kind of greeting from the time when I used to walk here barefoot . Sheikh Munis has been obliterated by the new buildings , and not a trace remains of its hedges , its vineyards and orchards . Here , not far from the place where the dome of the museum looms now , stood a sabra patch and a solitary cypress tree , next to which my clandestine meetings with Anton took place . Anton was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 237 nism , our liaison with the " revolutionary cell " in the district from Summeil to Abu Kishk . He was a university graduate who had studied law in Beirut and visited Moscow twice . His devotion to the Party was beyond question , but in his narrow mustache , his European clothes which underlined his foreignness in the Arab villages , there was a dandyishness unsuited to a professional revolutionary . His attitude to the Jewish comrades in the Party was not free of a certain ambivalence . He admired the way in which they allowed their heads to rule their hearts , but after we had become friends he admitted to me that he did not know if he himself would be able to be a member of a Party which did not recognize the national rights of his people . These words gave rise to painful feelings in me , as if he were accusing me of being a traitor to my people . I went to Efros and he put me right . There was no contradiction , he explained to me , between national sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed the " Zionist adventure " we were concerned first and foremost with the welfare of our own people . The revolution would solve the problem of the Jews  --  a people dispersed among the nations of the world  --  but until the revolution reached the Middle East and until the Arabs joined the family of enlightened nations , this tiny Jewish community , which did not shrink from dispossessing the toiling Arab masses of their land , would be the first victim of the chaos to come . It was well known , said Efros , that the Arabs were savages ... . I walked about the north of the city like a complete foreigner . I looked at the faces of the people hurrying through the streets and it seemed to me that they were staring at me because of my peculiar clothes . It began to rain and I went into Walter 's office . A whole floor in an office building . Walter welcomed me with demonstrative politeness and introduced me to his staff . Since he himself was busy , he asked one of the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , graduate of an American university , treated me like a provincial relation on a  | visit to the big city . He expected me to be full of admiration for all I saw . He showed me the terminal of a computer and was disappointed when I failed to stare at it openmouthed . Since Russian technology lagged behind the West , I was treated with a certain contempt as if I , too , was an inferior product of Soviet manufacture . In the end I could not restrain myself and said : " How , in your opinion , do they manage to send spaceships into space there ? By a court order ? " When the rain stopped I took a bus to Hess Street . I could still recognize a few of the buildings there , and for the first time I felt like a person who has come home . With heartfelt emotion , I stood outside a building that I had built with my own hands . Built and not finished . When the contractors found out who I was , they fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was even indignant . Working-class solidarity did not apply to Com-munists . The building looked as if it had not been touched since then , and was in need of urgent renovations . Here and there the plaster was peeling , and the balcony railings were rusty . The shutters were closed and the plants in the rectangular concrete planters next to the railings on the third floor were dry and dusty . Thin reddish-yellow stems like copper wire dangled from the planters and waved in the wind . It seemed that the people who lived there no longer went out to the balcony to look at the sea and the casino . On the left-hand balcony on the third floor there was a pile of junk covered with a gray cloth . When I fell from that balcony I landed on a pile of sand and was only slightly bruised . Daniel learned every possible lesson from this incident . First , we were at war with the contractors who were prepared to risk the lives of their workers to make a profit ; second , the Labor Federation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country was more important to them than the interests of the worker . I went into the lobby . Dilapidated mailboxes , their doors hanging open . Nameplates of lawyers . A dentist . A notary . I went up to the third floor . A lawyers ' office . The door opened , and a stylishly dressed girl peered at me with a look of alarm . p 239 " Are you looking for us , sir ? " I was covered with confusion . " I built this building , " I said . She retreated , closing the door softly behind her . " Some weirdo , " she said in a stage whisper . A man came out . He impaled me with a sharp look , decided that I was n't dangerous , and returned to the office . I walked back along Bialik Street . Here , next to Bialik 's house , I once met the poet Hoffstein , who was working as a clerk in the Tel Aviv municipality . He spoke about Bialik with respect and suppressed hatred . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the heart , he talks Yiddish , but when he goes inside that bourgeois house of his , he cooks up his dishes in the Holy Tongue .... " He told me that he was thinking of returning to Russia . He was a poet and he could n't survive without language . There was no hope for Yiddish in Eretz Israel . Fanatical Zionists and writers eaten up with hatred would not allow us to develop an original , popular culture , he complained . No one was stoned here yet ; but in order to stone a poet to death , there was no need for stones ? all you needed was words . Afterward I went to Olga 's gallery . I do n't recall whether I 've mentioned that , together with a friend of hers , she runs an art gallery . I assume that she does n't do it for money . She enjoys it . It gives her some kind of independence , even though Walter , it seems to me , is generous . Even to others . I wandered around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps . If there is anyone who can really and truly enjoy this kind of thing , I envy him . He has extended the horizons of his world . Speaking for myself , I can not pretend that these scribbles mean anything to me . I would n't express myself in the words of Khrushchev , of course . He was a crude character , and selected only the pithiest of popular expressions . From Olga 's partner I heard all kinds of illuminating explanations . They were more interesting and gripping than the works of art they were supposed to explain . The only thing that irritated me was her habit of asking from time to time : Are n't I right ? For a minute I wanted to say to her :  | My dear girl , these boys are leading you by the nose . But on second thought , I changed my mind . They may well have been perfectly serious . And I , for my part , want no more to do with dogmatic theories . Today I can only agree with Besskind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight for their right to exhibit their scribbles and sell them to the highest bidder . Nevertheless , however , I felt bad . It was not freedom of expression that was at stake here , but a kind of compulsion . There was terrific competition , and no way of attracting attention but by some kind of scandal . I thought about young people who wanted to create something beautiful and did not dare . They were afraid that no one would take any notice of them , if they did not find a way of shocking the public . I was sorry to hear a false note in Olga 's voice . She spoke confidently , and I felt that she was not confident at all . Some authority had spoken , and she copied his words like a parrot . In different circumstances I would probably have made some sarcastic remark . I do n't want to hurt Olga . But my heart contracted . People here are at liberty to choose to be completely free . There is no guiding theory , no obligation to adhere to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounced in a newspaper article . On the face of it . But even in matters of feeling and taste , people put their hands into silken fetters . Last night , on television , I met an old acquaintance . He was wearing a skullcap and he had shaved his beard , and I did not therefore recognize him at first sight . I had not seen him for almost forty years . It was a talk program about " totalitarian regimes . " There were a moderator , a professor of philosophy , and two or three participants I did not know . My man was introduced as a sinologist , and for a moment I thought that I must be mistaken . But as soon as he opened his mouth I knew : it was him , Efros . Only his name had changed . Now he was Professor Efrat . But in the eyes , which now had tiny crow 's feet at their corners , the same consuming fire burned . The gleaming bald pate , now p 241 covered with a skullcap , had spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bald men do not change much over the course of the years ; they only shrivel and their pates lose a little of their shine . When he spoke , Efros kept his hands in his lap in an effort to check their flight , but the fingers of his right hand danced nervously on the fist of his left , like a musician listening to a tune being played in his head . He spoke Hebrew in a melodious Russian accent , astonishingly tender and caressing , but at the same time he had adopted strikingly Anglo-Saxon mannerisms . Even the structure of his sentences in Hebrew was modeled on English . He spoke with irritating modesty . Yes , he was a sinologist , as the esteemed moderator had said , and he had spent a few years at Oxford " reading Chinese texts , " but he would not " call himself anything so exalted as an expert , " certainly not " an expert on totalitarian regimes " ? unless they were referring to the kind of expertise acquired by personal experience of Soviet labor camps ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it was in danger of being colored by excessive subjectivity . ... After this he made a few remarks about the struggles for power in the Chinese power elite , struggles whose secrecy , according to him , derived from the nature of a totalitarian regime , which could not flex its muscles without an ideological pretext . Since the masses were never asked anyway , and in their opinion every decision of the leadership was historically inevitable , the leadership was obliged to appear as one united body until the moment when one group overpowered the other . The rest of the proceedings took place in the courts . The rival group was accused of betraying the ideology common to both groups . Nobody believed these accusations . Nevertheless , they were accepted by all parties as the most practical means of arriving at a settlement between victors and vanquished . Thus in England , he concluded , although in an incomparably more humane manner , when the political leadership wanted to get rid of a monarch too sympathetic to Hitler , they allowed him to abdicate for love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | there were disagreements between the political leadership and the monarchy . The moderator shot a provocative question at Efros : When he observed the precepts of his religion without asking any questions , was he not himself embracing a " total ideology " ? Although it was opposed to the one he had embraced when he was the head of the Middle Eastern department of the Comintern , it , too , was total . " My learned friend , " Efros eagerly took up the challenge , " we must make a distinction between intellectual totality and emotional totality . " He had accepted the imperative of religious observance precisely because he sensed a kind of " totality of experience , " or , which was a better way of putting it , " the unity of creation , " or " cosmic sense , " an awareness profoundly steeped in emotional connotations , which had also taught him that his espousal of the revolution  --  a Jew incapable of killing a fly  --  stemmed from the attempt of a lapsed yeshiva scholar to live in a world without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . It was intended to bestow " total justification " on coercion . Kurakin , too , I remembered , believed that the root of all evil was to be found in human attempts to live without God . But he said it with real humility . Whereas the skullcap flaunted by Efros had something arrogant about it  --  the conceit of a man who thought himself under an obligation to hold perfect beliefs . Kurakin peeped through the window and was astonished that we did not see what he saw : that God was in everything , in the snow , the frozen skeletons of the trees , even the watchtowers ; a benevolent God , who loved all his creatures . Efros 's God was militant , jealous and vengeful , intolerant . To me , Efros 's way of talking seemed dishonest . He talked like a fanatic . And his eyes flashed . He ground his liberal opponent to dust . Stalin would never have succeeded in introducing such evil into millions of hearts but for the liberals who preceded him and uprooted God , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ted men to slay one another . I remembered how he had mocked Besskind . Then , too , he had hated the liberals more than our opponents on the right . I remembered the only argument I had ever had with Larissa . She admired a certain priest whose great soul was capable of embracing all the vileness of the world . He was one of those who " understood " both Hitler and Stalin . What did we want of them ? They were only mediocre people who found themselves in possession of power . Cleverer men than them told them that there was no God , and they concluded that everything was per-mitted . I could not endure this preaching . I saw it as appalling arrogance and madness . We of little faith , who wanted to know how and why , and how to prevent terrible things  --  we were the root of evil ? And he had transcended common humanity and was on a par with God ? Since he himself had suffered from the regime , it was impossible to accuse him of defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had failed , and that his only hope was to return to God . All the rest , in other words , all of human history , was insignificant . Larissa believed that he was a saint . How they had tortured him ! And he had refused to abandon his faith . I hurt her by saying that in my opinion he was an ignorant fool who enjoyed suffering and thought himself superior to ordinary mortals who contended with men , whether great or small . Efros , too , reminded me of this priest . I did not believe in his ostentatious humility , his show of piety . Nor did I like the way in which he drew attention to his sufferings in Russia . Closing his eyes , as if in a sudden seizure of pain . I must examine myself . I have certain accounts with God . Once I did not mind pronouncing his name . The language is full of his symbols , and they symbolize things which have no name . Sometimes you need a word to express indignation against things in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given me no peace . All my life I have maintained that He does not exist and behaved as if He does . And all too often , I meet  | people who say that He exists and behave as if He does n't . But I was never particularly fond of Efros . Am I jealous of his success ? Perhaps . When the moderator mentioned his books , saying that they were highly thought of by scholars , and he smiled with an expression that was dismissive and complacent at once  --  I almost jumped out of my chair with fury . Larissa Verchinsky , too , believed in God . Her God was an old Russian writer who dearly loved the people and roamed the countryside in soft felt shoes . He pitied his long-suffering creatures and had a wonderful surprise in store for them in the last chapter . We met in Solikamsk , shortly before they separated the men from the women . The first meeting was short , strange , and even ugly . I was sitting on a bench in the clinic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The medical orderly 's assistant , a crude , ignorant fellow , sprayed a stinging liquid onto the wound . A hefty woman , whose face I could not see , was sweeping up the dirty bandages he threw onto the floor . Bending down and walking backward , she came slowly closer , confronting us with a large backside in a shapeless dress , beneath which peeped two thick ankles in torn felt leggings . Suddenly the medical assistant had a bright idea : he turned the syringe from my leg to the woman 's buttocks and squirted a jet of the stinking liquid onto her dress , right opposite her vagina . A damp patch appeared , and he roared with laughter . The woman straightened up and stared at him . And there was something in her look that silenced him as effectively as if she had lashed him on the face with a whip . She was a girl from a peasant family who had somehow landed up in Leningrad in the years immediately following the revolution , and had studied literature there . Her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banished from their village and disappeared into the northern wastes , she had kept faith with their beliefs as a kind of commitment to preserve their memory . Her religion was abstract and intimate and she avoided talking about it . In Leningrad she had met a Jewish doctor and married him . He was an amateur student of p 245 culture and folklore and a collector of old icons , which at that time could be bought for next to nothing . They were not allowed to live together for more than a short time . She was arrested after her adored priest . Not long afterward her husband was arrested too . He was accused of trying to smuggle art treasures out of the country . Everything about her was broad and very typically Russian . Her Slavic features , her sturdy shoulders , her strong arms , her hefty thighs . She also loved in the way of Russian women who have read a lot of books . With absolute loyalty , with utter selfforgetfulness . When she came into possession of a rotten potato , I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I was afraid that she would faint . Another woman would have lifted her skirts for me among the filthy clothes in the laundry . We wrote love letters to each other . Her handwriting was exquisite , like a Chinese painting . In the course of time we developed a code . Even if our letters were seized , their content would not be understood . On the surface they resembled notes smuggled to each other by literature students during an examination . Larissa 's knowledge of Russian literature was so vast that she could write whatever she wanted to by a series of references to the heroes of the classical novels . Their virtues , their deeds , their travels , their bons mots , were reliable signposts to information of every kind  --  experiences , opinions , addresses . Even setting a time and a place for a meeting . We went on writing to each other after we were separated too . And also after we were set free . She went to the far north ( " with my own eyes I saw Frishvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archangel in her search for her parents . She found only two brothers , younger than herself , in the vicinity of Vologda . They had succeeded in establishing a farm in a district where the kolkhoz system was not very strict . Larissa joined them and invited me to come and live with her . There in Vologda , she wrote me , was the real Russia . The feudal lords had never reached those parts , and consequently the revolution went there on tiptoe . There were no kulaks to prosper on the bread of poverty  | which the peasants extracted from the frozen land . There was no one to covet their mite . There you could find pure Russian popular culture . " We have everything , even matches , " she quoted a saying she had heard in Samarkand , in times of great poverty . " I am an urban creature , " I wrote in reply , " and the Russian peasants slaughtered my forefathers . " For a time I lived in the suburbs of Zagorsk . From there I could slip into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residence permit . I stayed in the house of a widow , a guard at the railway crossing , and grew vegetables in the backyard . I described my life in a letter to Larissa . She replied in a letter which alluded to her wishes : " If Lavretsky has decided to return to the land after all , the air in Vologda is purer . " The railway guard found the letter . She was a good-looking , aggressive mischief maker , and she wanted to keep me there on a permanent basis . Although I told her from the start that I did not intend staying there long , she was jealous of every woman I spoke to . She was jealous of my books and notebooks too , and of any written word she found on my bed . Of the latter , because she was illiterate . Unluckily for me , she was overcome with curiosity to know what was hidden in the elegant curls of Larissa 's script . She showed the letter to a literate railway worker . He understood from Larissa 's letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , and not the name which I had given . The woman got into a panic and ran to the police . I escaped before the police agents arrived to arrest Lavretsky . At that time there was presumably a lack of manpower in Novosibirsk and the police were always raiding the little towns crowded with freed convicts within the periphery of a hundred versts around Moscow . Thus I lost Larissa 's letters and " Northern Snows , " a manuscript describing my experiences in Norilsk , Solikamsk , and Kaluga . I imagine that manuscript is now lying in the file of one Lavretsky , still at large , unless it had happened to come into the hands of an educated investigator who had read Turgenev in his p 247 youth . But if Larissa 's letters had fallen into the hands of some ignorant fellow , it was not beyond the bounds of possibility that files had been opened also against Grigboyedov , Pichurin , Labyedkin , and Myshkin , and the ignoramus in question would not be satisfied until they were caught . I have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No surprises are to be expected . The freshness of the first impressions has faded , and with it the excitement , and the melancholy at the sight of all the changes that have taken place . There is a good chance that tomorrow will be like today . I have let things slide . I no longer fear forgetting tomorrow what I have neglected to write down today . Whatever I forget tomorrow , I shall remember the day after . And if not , it means that it made no impression on me . The memory of an old man is willing to let go of the new . It prefers the old , and clings to the oldest of all . I must let time pass , and the apartment I am so eagerly awaiting will come in its own good time . As if it were being constructed from my patience . Every hour in which I am able to ignore its existence lays another brick . The members of my family have grown accustomed to my existence . Even Nimrod 's wife sometimes speaks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sturdy , handsome boys . I shall never know what they are really like . My lot is to gaze at them from afar . Like Moses and the Promised Land . The maid , Nadya , has learned to cook borscht . Nina has disappeared . She gives no sign . I seem to have put her mind at rest . I have no demands . And she is not troubled by the fact that I exist somewhere or other , beyond the pale . I make enough from the translations to keep myself in dignity . Let no one be misled by the last word . I am still not able to give my grandchildren the presents I would like to give them . But at least I am no longer in the position I was in some time ago . When I got onto the bus and sat down and opened my  | wallet , only to discover that I did not have a penny in it . I was not obliged to get off again  --  a kind woman paid my fare . But the driver said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a word . I wonder , was he referring to the old , or to the Russians ? In my spare time I build my house . I have decided to add on another floor , for my grandchildren and visitors from out of town . I am also learning electronics in English . It is not as complicated as I feared . I listen to Arabic lessons over the radio . And I try not to miss " A Moment of Hebrew " either . Once a week I go out . I registered myself at the center for volunteers . From time to time they call me and ask me if I can help some old man who is unable to take care of his own needs . I am glad to do it . Usually , I am asked to do something simple . Like washing them . Not a very difficult job . They are usually not heavy . I enjoy it . First of all , because it 's a mitzvah . They 're grateful and it gives me satisfaction . But also because every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I get my bus fares back . And if I have to travel far , I also get expenses . It 's nice to be a busy man , who needs eight days to the week . Today was a great occasion for us . Nimrod regained conscious-ness . I must be precise in my use of words . Perhaps I should keep " great " for some other time . He regained consciousness  --  but he does n't know anybody . He can perceive objects , figures , but he ca n't talk . The doctors say that he will have to be taught everything all over again . As if a baby had been born into the family . They wo n't allow me to see him , in order not to disturb him . Perhaps they think he should get used to the people whose pictures he carries somewhere in his brain first , and only then to strangers . Nevertheless , I was very excited by the news . Hope is like a stimulating and dangerous drug . And how much the more so , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had resigned myself to my fate . I thought that we would never meet . I was the only one to give up . Perhaps because the others had a real p 249 person , and I had only an abstraction . They knew whom they were were waiting for . A painful lesson . I went outside . It was midday . The road is lined with an avenue of ficus trees whose branches touch overhead . It was very still , like in a forest . I experienced a marvelous sensation of recall , as if something that had happened many years before were happening again : the same silence , the same warbling birds , the same mood . It was in Moscow , in 1919 , in the Izmailovi Park . The sound of shooting had stopped . Everything suddenly looked as if it were going to go on forever : a high sky with motionless clouds . A Sabbath world . " We have come into the world only to see the face of the sun . " Every movement is a sign from on high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird has come from southern lands . In the afternoon I went to cool my fevered brain at " Zilber-stein 's . " That is not his real name . A nickname I call him to myself . He is an Orthodox Jew , and for some reason I have chosen to believe that Nina 's husband resembles him . An idea not lacking in a certain malice . The secret spite of the soul gossiping to itself . I imagine Nina in the arms of this man , whose flabby , helpless body is like a rag in my hands . I can feel a pity full of gloating for him . One day I shall have to ask his pardon . Naked in the lukewarm water of the bath , he rests his shriveled head in my hand and closes his eyes in enjoyment . In his dried-up body forgotten sensations revive . I soap his smooth chest , and the movement of my hand pulls the flabby skin down over his ribs . A rinse in warm water and the smile of a baby blooms on the dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my strong hands , and carry him to his bed like a little child . He holds out his legs and arms to be dressed with a sacrificial gesture . Gradually he disappears into his clothes . The head remains . Like a bird of prey whose eyes are wise . This time , after breathing in the smell of the clean sheets , he held out his matchstick-thin fingers to me . With great pity I gathered them into my hard , big hand , making an effort not to squeeze them . He promised me that I would go to Heaven .  | If you say so . He insisted . In a cracked voice , as he was entitled to speak for them . He is strict in religious observance . When the female social worker comes into his room , he looks at the ceiling and addresses her in the third person . He needs a nurse to look after him , but he refuses to let a woman touch him . And there are no male nurses available . Since he can take a few steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kerosene ring on which he cooks his meals , there is no place for him in a nursing home . In the meantime he can make do with my help . I bathe him once a week and change his sheets once a fortnight . No trouble at all . When you see him in his wretched room in a slummy neighborhood in the south of the city , poring over pious old books and soundlessly saying his prayers with his crooked neck trembling , you would think that he had grown old here together with the ancient house and the huge , gnarled eucalyptus tree in the courtyard . But the truth is that he is a man of the world , and the eyelids drooping over the little letters , as if they were muttering together with his lips , veil many sights in distant lands . Before the Second World War he was the rabbi of a me-dium-sized town in Hungary . He was in the famous train from Bergen-Belsen . He spent a few years in Sweden and there too he served as a rabbi . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in Brooklyn . He was never a Zionist . But after his wife passed away and his daughter was raped and murdered by a Negro , he left America and came to his relations in Israel . He had no idea how poor they were . They died soon after his arrival in the country and he was left alone . He was living on his savings , but he was very careful with his money , in case he still had a long time to live . He is sorry for my irreligious state and he prays for me , too . He says that if only I knew how sweet it was to pray from the heart , I would not miss a single prayer . After I bathe him , he says to me : " You pray with your big strong hands , the hands of a Jewish peasant . " He says this every time as if he had just this minute coined the phrase . He said that he finds it difficult to believe that " after all I p 251 have been through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that reason , I replied . If I had been allowed to live my life in peaceful contemplation , like a boy lying in the forest next to the lake , listening to the splashing of the water and looking at the treetops swaying in the breeze beneath the infinitely high sky ? perhaps I would have had a revelation . The sense of the infinity of the universe would have filled me with a kind of reverence . But I was not prepared to learn of the existence of God from suffering . I told him that in the camps , whenever a new wave of prisoners arrives , there are always some who experience a religious revival  --  Jewish , Christian , Moslem , or Brahmin as the case may be . I have seen old Communists who had lost their faith in the possibility of ordering human existence according to reason , and had sought a refuge from the chaos in their hearts in the bosom of religion . A new prisoner , when he is brought face to face with the cruel laws of the camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of his eyes . The relations between men , even between prisoners , seem to him the absolute evil , or the absolute lie . His outraged soul seeks to hold on to something which will justify in its eyes the will to live . He looks to the opposite pole for the absolute good , the perfect truth , the divine order . And thus the new prisoners find their way to some rabbi or priest , whose consoling words are like balm to their souls . But as they gradually become acquainted with the way of life in the camp , they realize that a resourceful man can somehow get along if he knows how to fix himself up in the clinic , or assisting the kitchen workers to unload the flour from the wagons . And then they begin to rely on themselves again . And the priest and the rabbi go out to look for new victims . My words distressed him . He consoled himself with the thought that " my actions spoke louder than my words . " He believed that there was God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have to admit that I had been wrong . These visits have opened a peephole into remote corners for me . They are teaching me many curious things about human lives and also about the history of Eretz Israel .  | From time to time I take care of a man who is confined to a wheelchair . A hopeless case of muscular degeneration . He boasted to me that he used to be as strong as an ox . And he hinted that he , personally , could take the credit for certain heroic but unmentionable exploits . He had been a member of an extreme right-wing nationalist organization during the thirties ; he was arrested , escaped , was caught , exiled to Eritrea , escaped , and was caught again ; even after the establishment of the State of Israel he had been a member of some underground organization . I feel sorry for him . He would like to point an accusing finger at the Labor Party he hates so much , but his hand refuses to obey him . He talks to me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , presumably I must agree with what he says : the workers ' strikes are destroying the country ; and one day we will have to pay for the fact that we are not treating the Arabs in the only way they understand  --  i.e. , with an iron fist . He almost had a fit when I told him that I had been in the Socialist Workers Party in the old days . But he soon recovered . We had already been given what we deserved in the Red mother-land . In an old-age home for the incurably ill and incapacitated , the social worker sent me to a paralyzed man of about my own age , whom I visit once a fortnight and for whom I do various trifling errands . Usually , he asks me to write letters to the newspapers for him . He is a handsome man who once had a certain role to play in the Haganah . In the distant days of his youth he was so full of confidence in the importance of the tasks which fell to his lot that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had any children . He showed me snapshots of himself with an expression of grim heroism on his face , wearing the riding breeches which indicated to the initiated the clandestine nature of his role . The day the Israeli Defense Forces were established , his world fell to pieces . Ben-Gurion , his sworn enemy  --  for political reasons , as he explained to me , since he was a member of the  | left wing of the labor movement  --  awarded him the rank of major , which wounded his pride . All his friends and admirers were under the impression that he was one of the pillars of I aganah , and now it transpired that for thirty years he had been perpetrating an empty boast . He became a bitter , quarrelsome man and spent his time attacking the defense forces in letters full of hints to the initiated and words to the wise . Friends exerted t heir influence on his behalf , and he retired from the army with t he rank of lieutenant colonel . Late in life he married the widow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After she died , he became paralyzed . Friends , with sympathetic expressions on their faces which he found hard to bear , came to visit him rarely , as if according to a duty roster arranged among them on the telephone . They brought him all the newspapers , and whenever there was an article about the history of Eretz Israel , especially military matters , he would dictate a letter to the editor to me . Most of these letters begin : " In the number of your newspaper , in the section " Once Upon a Time " ( or Episodes From the Past , or Today Forty Years Ago , and so on ) you published an article by about . As one who then served as and was responsible for in my capacity as , I regard it as my duty to put the record straight . " I am a sympathetic audience , and in the lack of information from any other quarter I agree with everything he tells me and encourage him to pile on the details . The social worker says that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does no good either . A short visit to my son . His beard has been shaved off , and there is a white cap on his head , something like the turbans which our mothers used to wear . His eyes are open , following moving objects , but their expression is frighteningly blank . They look right through you without stopping . I remembered : Vladimir . The interrogation . I went into the room . Opposite me sat a pockmarked Asian . With the same expression in his eyes . For the first time I was terrified before  | they touched me . A primeval terror . Like the sudden awakening from a nightmare . Beware of the man without a soul . I seek in vain for traces of myself in my son 's face . Not a single feature . Not the nose , not the chin , not the jaws . The eyes are black . Vera 's features , too , are missing . As if he fell into our lives out of nowhere . A lost soul . The embodiment of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me too . She bent over his bed and tried to get him to repeat the sounds " Dad-dy . " A sad , pathetic sight . But Vera was not the woman to be deterred . When she did not succeed , she came back to me with an apologetic look . Never mind . Another time . She dragged me to the bed , made me stand closer , to engrave my image on his brain . A disturbing thought : Had all the memories , the knowledge he had accumulated , been wiped out ? One blow and you were no longer yourself . And you had to begin again from the beginning . How could I help him ? Better not to think about it . The accident had made me into a father . Perhaps I would be needed . My son , it seemed , was now in the twilight of a new birth . The Passover Seder at Tel Yosef . A great crowd . Among the flood of guests , your strangeness stands out . Laid tables . A stage . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition and a bit of contemporary poetry . A solemn ceremony , still somewhat artificial . Forty years like yesterday . I too was given a verse from a poem by Alterman to read . I got mixed up and a small child laughed . I remembered the festival in the days of the Brigade . A bit of reading and a lot of dumplings . A choir sang Russian songs and a Hasidic song , too . To remind us . Once , in Ein Harod , I was God . My voice was heard from the mountaintop . I knew the answers to all the questions . In Jerusalem we went out after the Seder to the Orthodox quarter to eat bread in public . We were beaten up and came back happy . We had fought the good fight . I sat with Vera among people I did not know . Two soldiers without families , a couple of new immigrants who knew no He-  | brew , a boy who had quarreled with his parents , and a middleaged man who had arrived at the last minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought of Vera 's loneliness . Some of our generation were sitting at tables crowded with their offspring , three generations . During the singing after the meal we spoke about Nimrod . The middle-aged man turned out to be a member of Nimrod 's peer group . He called him " Tiger . " But that was evidently the nickname given to all the reserve officers who volunteered to command outposts on the Suez Canal . He had amusing anecdotes to tell . They had turkeys in their little menagerie . They laid eggs and hatched them . Nimrod was too impatient to wait . He lit a primus stove under an upside-down tub and put the eggs inside it . From time to time he would remove an egg and crack it , to see if there was already a chick inside it . We laughed . I felt a strange happiness stirring in me : my traces in my son . If not a physical resemblance , one characteristic at least , this impa-t fence . In the room there was a surprise waiting for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , articles in the kibbutz paper , school essays . Olga 's letters were n't there . Like rummaging in an empty drawer . The articles about the economic affairs of the kibbutz lacked all individuality . When he worked in the dairy branch , he demanded increased investment in it . When he worked in the garage , he claimed its due . When he was the kibbutz treasurer , he demanded a cut in expenditure . Some of the articles were obituaries for comrades fallen in the War of Independence . They too did not illuminate a personality . Everything fitted everybody : we were stunned , impossible to accept it . And it did not suit the young man in question to be dead ; how could he be dead  --  he loved life so much . Only in one of them did he state a fact , which leaped out of the verbiage like lightning : a boy who chased a foal all the way to the Bedouin tents next to the Sahne pool had a face of his own . Only one of the articles showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall newspaper at school
