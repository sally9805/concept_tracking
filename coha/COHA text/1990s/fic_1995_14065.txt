Mise en scene : SEATTLE IN THE 1950 's . The stage should be divided into two playing areas : the OUTSIDE , which is always various parts of VOLUNTEER PARK including a DESERTED BEACH and the LONGHOUSE OF A SALISH INDIAN TRIBE , and the INSIDE , which is always various parts of the DARK HOUSE including the MATERNITY WARD of a 1940 's Seattle Hospital , the DARK FAMILY LIVING ROOM , YOUNG JOAN 'S BOUDOIR , the BONFIRE GIRLS ' RECREATION ROOM , the LABORATORY OF DR . DARK , and whatever other terrain is needed . Whenever necessary , actors should double and triple ( but not cross-gender ) their roles . Ten actors are enough . Everything that can be represented physically , should be represented physically . When it is impossible or ridiculous to use an actor or a prop , use rear-projections or film . This is a fast show , sports-car fast in the scene changes . If there is a proscenium , it should suggest a rainbow . Completely black stage . Sound of precipitation as the Audience enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes out its programs and begins to read the first scene . Silently . The first scene . ( Printed in the Audience 's programs . ) PLAYWRIGHT 'S STUDY . A desk , a chair , some books . MARLENE DIETRICH , looking like herself ( more so , if possible ) , sits leggily on the edge of a large desk , waving a contract like a fan in the face of the female PLAYWRIGHT . MARLENE DIETRICH This is how we do things in pictures , darling . Everything in the contract . That should appeal to you as a writer , no ? p. 3 JOAN SCHENKAR ( straight into the audience ) I do n't know how Marlene Dietrich got to be my Literary Agent . Can you imagine ? I mean I had expected maybe Jane Austen . Dorothy Parker in a pinch . But Marlene Dietrich ? ! ! ! MARLENE DIETRICH Pick up that pen darling . The signature goes right here at the bottom . JOAN SCHENKAR After a while , I came to see the logic in this lustrous creature sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doing her makeup , giving me advice . She knew all the tricks writers use to postpone working MARLENE DIETRICH I know what you 're thinking and you can clean out the refrigerator later . Much much later . JOAN SCHENKAR and she took the job of inspiring me very seriously . MARLENE DIETRICH Now why do n't you finish that monologue , darling . And do something about your hair . JOAN SCHENKAR I began to take her cruising in my sportscar . MARLENE DIETRICH ( rolling her eyes ) How I hate riding in tiny automobiles JOAN SCHENKAR I was so dazzled by her radiance that I found her slipping between the sheets of my work p. 4 MARLENE DIETRICH ( holding her head ) Kitsch , darling . That is ab-so-lute kitsch ! No writer should ever do kitsch ! ( smooths SCHENKAR 's cheek ) And , darling . Believe me . A little make-up would n't hurt . JOAN SCHENKAR ( a little hurt ) Unfortunately , my Agent was allowed to criticize as well as inspire . MARLENE DIETRICH Ach ! Liebchen ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could speak about them . Which I cannot. ( seductively ) And by the way , I hope this new play has a part for me. ( muses ) Perhaps a saint . I 've done too many whores , darling . JOAN SCHENKAR ( a revelation , she picks up her pen ) A saint End of first scene . Lights up on the Audience . Crowd sounds , recorded , the buzz and hum of a rapidly filling theatre . The Audience should be temporarily deceived into thinking the sounds are coming from them . VOICES of a couple , DR . GEORGE and MRS . MARTHA DARK , making their way down a crowded row in the theatre , interrupting the Audience as it reads the first scene . VOICES " Excuse me . " " Pardon me madam . " " Sorry sir . " " Be careful George , that 's a hat . " " That 's not a hat that 's my foot . " Watch out , watch out . " " God I hate crowds , " etc. etc . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 5 MARTHA DARK I smell smoke , George . There 's smoke in here . DR . GEORGE DARK You are always smelling smoke , Martha . MARTHA DARK Not in a movie theatre , George . I never smell smoke in a movie theatre . An insistent crackling sound . The black stage begins to burn and smolder like cigarette paper . MARTHA DARK George . I hear something . DR . GEORGE DARK I hear it too . MARTHA DARK It sounds like paper crackling GEORGE . It sounds like DR . GEORGE DARK FIRE . AUDIENCE FIRE ! FIRE ! FIRE ! FIRE ! The black stage is engulfed in smoke . The title " Burning Desires " burns in flames thru the darkness , just in time to prevent the Audience from stampeding the exits . Suddenly the adult , present-day JOAN OF ARC is revealed on stage at the wheel of a white 1957 TRIUMPH convertible with a serious exhaust problem . JOAN , swathed in exhaust smoke , alight with spiritual flames , sits in the car like a stunt driver . JOAN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and conspicuously lights up a Gauloise ) This is the story of Joan of Arc and how she came to be born into a new fate . It 's been my story for a long time and now it 's going to be yours . Listen to me carefully . I have never told it like this before . Appropriate visuals for JOAN 's story appear  --  all of them depicting an exquisitely ordered city of Seattle , painted in 50 's pastels  --  with backdrops as emerald and fictitious as an Irish Spring . p. 6 JOAN Here is Seattle , Washington , long before it was discovered by the rest of you . It 's 1957 or ' 58 right now and a light rain is falling . ( she opens a small umbrella and raises it above her head ) The story  --  my story  --  will begin here . In 1958 everyone in Seattle is smoking Newports or Marlboros and driving Buicks with Powerglide transmissions . ( Armies of smokers in Buick convertibles broach the bridges of Seattle . ) JOAN All the men go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzz the backs of a thousand male necks . ) JOAN All the women keep house and visit the beauty parlor . ( A hundred hair dryers in a hundred hair salons rev up to " hi . " ) JOAN The boys play baseball . ( Boys beat each other with bats on a baseball diamond . ) JOAN The girls do synchronized swimming . ( Girls in matching petaled caps swim notably out of order . ) JOAN The Beatniks are safely in San Francisco . ( Cafs wih no customers . ) JOAN Family values prevail . ( A family snarlingly adjusts itself for a group photograph. ) p. 7 JOAN And everywhere in the city , the rain falls without ceasing . ( A torrential downpour . ) JOAN Fireplaces fizzle , ( Rain pours down a chimney , completely extinguishing the fire in a family room . ) JOAN barbeques smolder , ( An entire Shriners ' picnic looks dumbly at a damp raw pig . ) JOAN arsonists lose heart , ( A pyromaniac weeps over water-logged matches . ) JOAN even , smokers ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cigarettes all over town go out mid-puff . ) JOAN You could n't start a fire in Seattle to save your life  --  or to take someone else's.It 's the perfect moment for the reappearance of Joan of Arc . This time , she might not burn . Montage of 40 's images of statues and paintings of JOAN OF ARC  --  all in the final agonies of martyrdom JOAN Before the infant Joan Dark was born in Seattle , Washington , it rained in the city for three whole months Sound of torrential rains comes up under the last few words and quickly rises to Hurricane Andrew level . A crack of lightening in the form of a fleur-de-lys , an amazing succession of high cumulus formations , instant night , and the strangest configuration of stars and planets since the Book of Revelation was made public . Blackout . Lights up : JOAN 'S BEDROOM which , in this scene , doubles as a WORLD WAR 2 MATERNITY WARD . Everything green and grey , wartime shortages everywhere apparent . Lights are flickering as an infant ( baby JOAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a DOCTOR and an indifferent NURSE . DOCTOR Here it comes , nurse . Here it comes . Get ready . We do n't want you to drop this one . The INFANT appears , smiles , glows phosphorescently , and lisps a line from one of the shorter Emily Dickinson poems . No one notices the poetry , but the seedy NURSE ( who 's palming a Pall Mall ) fumbles the INFANT in shock when a flock of white doves attacks the DOCTOR as he approaches the baby 's umbilical cord with a nasty surgical tool . The DOCTOR cowers in a corner , beaten back by the whirring wings of the enraged birds . The newborn INFANT speaks distinctly to the DOCTOR : p. 8 JOAN I do n't yike you . DOCTOR ( trying to get the NURSE 's attention ) Nurse ! Nurse ! Jesus Christ , Nurse ! The baby just said something ! The room is suddenly bathed in golden light and all eyes turn to the window as the crummy NURSE holding BABY JOAN points to the spreading sunshine . NURSE Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun 's out ! You can see the goddamn mountains ! You can see the goddamn trees ! It 's a miracle ! It 's a real miracle ! ( she holds the INFANT JOAN in one arm and smokes her Pall Mall furiously with the other ) A fabulous rainbow enters the room and points to the glowing , crowing INFANT JOAN . The NURSE , shocked again by the rainbow in the act of lighting another cigarette , and again missing the real miracle , drops little JOAN on the floor . NURSE Ooooops . Blackout . Lights up : the DARK HOUSE . The heads of DR . GEORGE and MRS . MARTHA DARK in profile in a large frame . They are both smoking energetically . She smokes Kents , he smokes Chesterfields . The frame hovers over CHILD JOAN , age 7 or 8 , upstage in her pink and white and blonde-wood BEDROOM . She is constructing , with great meticulousness , a somewhat ecumenical altar featuring the Baby Jesus and his Mother , the black Madonna of Poland , Mary of Medjugorje , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jael and her Nail , a statue of Kuan Yin , a statue of Kali the Destroyer , and pictures of Emily Dickinson , Emily Bront , Gertrude Stein , and Diana of the Ephesians , with drawn bow . LITTLE JOAN hums liturgical music happily as she works . Occasionally she performs small miracles . p. 9 MARTHA DARK George . I never thought we 'd have a religious child . I thought many things , George , when I found myself pregnant for the first time . Believe me , between the vomiting and the headaches , I thought many things . But I never thought the outcome would be religious . We should have sued the nurse who dropped her , George . We should have sued the hospital . Lights up : LITTLE JOAN kneels before the statue of the goddess Diana . LITTLE JOAN holds a large , lethal peashooter . YOUNG JOAN ( with immense feeling and a slight lisp ) Oh goddess Diana .

JOAN , a lovely 12 year old , is on her knees before her altar , speaking to the images . As she addresses each one , it illuminates and seems to breathe . JOAN Emily Dickinson , thank you for that poem . Even my English teacher did n't understand it . p. 10 MARTHA DARK How else do you think she gets those perfect grades , George . She stays in her room and she does her work . I only wish her brothers were that conscientious .

( straight to the Audience ) I 'm having trouble translating from the ancient Greek . DR . GEORGE DARK ( purpling ) Aaargh . Cute . For godssake Martha , Joan is running around this city with a bow on her shoulder and a quiver on her back ! I 'm taking her athletic privileges away Martha ! I 'm taking her sportscar away ! MARTHA DARK Oh look George . It 's raining again . DR . GEORGE DARK What do you mean raining again Martha . It 's just raining harder , that 's all .

She wanted to join the Brownies but I did n't care for the uniforms . Lights up : YOUNG JOAN in her smoking TRIUMPH quiver on her back , appears to drive thru the rain like a pro . A flock of doves flutters around the TRIUMPH . DR . GEORGE DARK ( still in his frame ) Bonfire Girls . Hah . I 'm surprised she did n't try for the Boy Scouts . Lights up : ADULT JOAN in the TRIUMPH . Big drag on her Gauloise . JOAN Of course I tried for the Scouts . They did n't want me . Lights up : NANCY DETWILER 'S BASEMENT . Another part of the stage . A BONFIRE GIRLS meeting is in progress . The girls are in full regulation uniform  --  a hideous confusion of Girl Guide and Kwakiutl Indian  --  and they look ridiculous . They 're making up each other 's faces , perming hair , dancing with each other . Cigarette smoke is everywhere apparent and there 's a smoldering fire in the rec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anything at hand  --  books , small pieces of furniture , the family poodle , etc . A solid atmosphere of juvenile delinquency prevails . p. 13 JOAN ( recoiling slightly at the sight of the fire , she whispers ) Is this where I 'm supposed to be , Diana ? VOICE ( celestial , cool ) Wherever you are , Joan dear , is where you 're supposed to be . Hang on to your bow . A chorus of BONFIRE GIRL voices howl : " Shuddup I ca n't hear the music , " " Christ Jeanie you spilled the beer , " " Oh god do n't tell me she 's the new member , " " Feed the fire , " " Feed the fire ! " FEED THE FIRE ! " NANCY ( emerging from behind a cloud of smoke ) I am Nancy Detwiler , these are the Bonfire Girls , and this ( points to the carnage ) is what we do at meetings .

I just saw Nancy 's mother out there ( points out the picture window ) rooting up the rhododendrons . ANNE She 's looking for cigarette butts . NANCY Oh Christ ! CINDY That 's all we need another inspection . JESSIE The whole damn troop 's on probation for swearing anyway . Throw me some blue ones . GRETCHEN Jeez these things are ugly .

Watch my form on this one . ( takes out an arrow , nocks it , whirls around and lets it fly into a dartboard 6 inches from the right ear of NANCY 'S MOTHER ) MOTHER JESUS CHRIST !

I 'm not supposed to mention this . p. 16 CINDY Yeah I bet you 're not . Hey Nance ( she 's getting drunker ) . Who does Joan remind you of ? JULIE ( also tipsy ) Catherine of course . Why 'd we let ole Catherine in ? GRETCHEN ( sotto voce ) Why 'd we let Joan in ? NANCY My mother plays golf with her mother that 's why . CAROLINE Where the hell is Catherine anyway ?

NANCY Joan has something in common with you Catherine . CATHERINE ( languidly ) Oh really . VOICE ( of DIANA ) You do n't have anything in common with her , Joan dear , but go ahead .

( practiced pause ) She never says a word about anything . p. 18 JOAN ( genuinely excited ) Gee . A wedding gown . I wonder what the Goddess Diana would think of ( Pauses as tho ' listening ) Uh oh . Oh . Really Diana ? And St. Marlene agrees ? ( wincing ) Is n't that a little harsh ? Blackout . Lights up : ADULT JOAN in her TRIUMPH , high above the city of Seattle .

PRESENT-DAY JOAN pauses at the top of QUEEN ANNE HILL . JOAN After the incident with Catherine , I began to drive the streets of Seattle , looking for a clue to my waiting fate . I knew I was being prepared for something  --  the Goddess Diana had dropped a few hints about destiny  --  but my other voices were silent on the subject . ( big drag on a Gauloise ) Meanwhile , and very suddenly , the Goddess Diana withdrew from my life . Lights up : YOUNG JOAN , disconsolate , sits in VOLUNTEER PARK . p. 19 VOICE ( of DIANA ) I 'm going away Joan dear . On a honeymoon trip . With a Greek poet . You 'd love her work .

JOAN The city I saw was a place of lush gardens and emerald lawns ( in a lush garden a band of boys tries to steal YOUNG JOAN 's TR-3 ; she jujitsus each of them over her shoulder ; they land on an emerald lawn . In the background , several BONFIRE GIRLS are trying to ignite a lovely bed of tulips . ) JOAN of sparkling waters and constant cloud covers . ( the Seattle Fire Department hoses thousands of gallons of sparkling water on an enormous fire at The Kline-Gallen Home for the Aged ; YOUNG JOAN methodically and repeatedly emerges from the billowing smoke with a rescued old person in her arms , on her back , or in a borrowed wheelchair . A troop of BONFIRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames with real excitement. ) p. 20 JOAN A church-going city . ( in front of a Cathedral a BOY SCOUT pushes a BONFIRE GIRL to the ground . The BONFIRE GIRL punches the boy thru the Cathedral 's open door . ) JOAN A city so clean that garbage cans were forbidden within its limits . At least you never saw garbage cans in Seattle . ( BONFIRE GIRLS , impersonating good citizens , light trash fires for fun . ) YOUNG JOAN , the JOAN OF 1958 , now replaces ADULT JOAN in the TRIUMPH and in the narration . ADULT JOAN relinquishes both positions with grace and good humor . JOAN I used to spend a lot of time  --  before St. Marlene after the visits started , my mind began to move in other patterns .
