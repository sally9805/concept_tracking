Why are investors shrugging off the company 's litigation woes ? // Whenever an important tobacco case goes to trial-and there have been some half-dozen trials in the past six years-a tobacco analyst named Gary Black , from the Wall Street research firm Sanford C. Bernstein , has a certain routine he follows . He recruits someone , often a student from a law school in the vicinity of the courthouse , to sit in the courtroom for the trial 's duration . This person is hired to watch the proceedings , of course , but also to pickup courtroom scuttlebutt and provide some analysis of the legal fine points being argued . At the end of each day 's session , this observer calls in what he or she has learned to Black , who writes it up , adds his own analysis and sends it along to his clients . It should be obvious why a securities analyst would do this , but let 's take a second to spell it out anyway . First , litigation is widely viewed as the key variable in determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short-term price of stocks in that sector . Indeed , the uncertainty that litigation presents is the main reason for the paltry priceto-earnings ratios of the tobacco stocks . So if Black can get a sense of how a particular trial is going for Big Tobacco , he can make better stock calls . Second , by having his own eyes and ears in the courtroom , Black does n't have to depend on the industry for his information . " We just do n't like to trust the industry 's judgment on this stuff , because in their eyes , everything 's always wonderful , " he says bluntly . Since mid-October , I 've been sitting in a courtroom in Washington , D.C. , watching different , but also very important , litigation : United States vs . Microsoft Corp. , the most important antitrust case in decades . The courtroom is surprisingly small for a case this big , holding only around 100 spectators . Some attendees are reporters ; others are paid observers from such companies ( and Microsoft competitors ) as Oracle and Sun Microsystems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you ask , invariably tell you that they are proud owners of Microsoft stock . Much to my surprise , though , I 've yet to meet anyone at the trial representing Wall Street . That is to say , none of the many technology analysts who cover Microsoft seem to have bothered to follow Black 's example and place someone in the courtroom . Instead , Wall Street appears to be viewing the trial as a giant yawn . " If all you prove is that Microsoft is n't nice , we already know that , " shrugs one well-respected analyst . ( Tellingly , he asked that his name not be attached to this quote . ) Microsoft holds a weekly conference call for the investment community in which it puts its upbeat spin on the trial , and the analysts ( unlike Black ) seem perfectly content to be spoon-fed in this fashion . And instead of suffering from uncertainty , Microsoft stock had a spectacular run in 1998 , up about 100% by early December , when this column went to press . Far from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the market has made its judgment : not guilty Sitting in the courtroom , I have to wonder about that judgment . Every day , I see a company trying to defend itself from charges that it tried to divide markets illegally , that it attempted to force allies and rivals alike to drop technologies it viewed as " anti-Microsoft " and that it took actions solely designed to hurt competitors , with no compensatory consumer benefits-the classic definition of an anticompetitive act . I see a company desperately trying to deny that it has a monopoly , despite its 90% share of the desktop operating-system market . I 've seen Microsoft e-mails that have made my jaw drop . And of course I 've seen the portions of Bill Gates ' videotaped deposition that have been played in court-a deposition in which Gates acts ( as Stewart Alsop nicely phrased it in a recent issue of Fortune ) " as if he were a teenager with something to hide from an overzealous parent . " What I 've seen , in other words , is a company getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of this is to say that the government 's case is a slam dunk , or that Microsoft will ultimately be found guilty of violating the antitrust laws . For one thing , the recent AOL-NetscapeSun deal-a deal , ironically , that involved the three companies that had most eagerly helped the government make its case-seems to give Microsoft ammunition to argue that it faces plenty of competition . For another , antitrust law is a complicated beast , and even before the AOL-Netscape-Sun deal , it was hard to gauge how this case would play out . The trial judge seems to favor the government ; the court of appeals has already signaled that it appears to favor Microsoft . The variables-the uncertainties-are endless . Plainly , though , this case is neither frivolous nor inconsequential , no matter what Wall Street thinks . I 'm sure Microsoft is telling the analysts that the government has n't laid a glove on it-I know that 's what the company is telling reportersbut that 's just not so . At the very least the uncertainty of the outcome should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio , as with tobacco stocks . Why has n't that happened ? I think it is because investors are less interested in coolly evaluating Microsoft 's prospects than they are in simply rooting for the company . Can nothing hurt Microsoft ? The main reason the Street gives for blowing off the trial is that Microsoft will almost certainly avoid being broken up into pieces-a la Standard Oil in 1911-even if it loses big . " For all the damaging e-mails , " says Andrew Kessler , a partner at Velocity Capital , a technology investment firm , " there is no smoking gun that would force the breakup of the company Microsoft has 50% pretax margins and a 30% to 40% growth rate . Unless you are going to split that sucker up , that will continue . " It does , indeed , seem implausible that Microsoft will be broken up . But breaking up Microsoft was never really in the cards ; rather , it is a proposal that has been consistently floated by Microsoft 's rivals , particularly Sun Microsystems , and speculated upon by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking up Microsoft actually help Microsoft shareholders ? After all , look at what happened when AT &T; was broken up : Investors smart enough to hold on to their new Baby Bell shares made a small fortune . But I digress . ) But then Wall Street takes the next step-and lands on much shakier ground . It says that there is simply no way the company can be hurt by the trial , no matter what happens . This line of reasoning is absurd . First of all , Microsoft is already being hurt by the trial . Its reputation is being damaged by the daily revelations of acts that are unseemly-even if they are ultimately ruled to be legal . Rivals that had previously cowered in the face of Microsoft 's power are beginning to feel emboldened . Gates himself has had several dents put in his halo . And most signficantly , if we can safely say that the company wo n't be broken up , we can also say just as safely that Microsoft will come out of the trial having been designated a " monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means that Microsoft will have to temper some of its practices-because under the law , monopolies have to play by a different set of rules from everybody else . And second , it will make it much easier for competitors to sue the company , claiming they were victims of Microsoft 's alleged predatory practices . Neither of these things can possibly be good for the company 's stock . Other than those two near certainties-Microsoft wo n't be broken up , and it will be declared a monopolynobody knows how this case will turn out , and anyone who says otherwise is a fool . After all , the market hates lawsuits precisely because they involve uncertainty , however strong a company 's case appears . Lawsuits are not always decided rationally . They sometimes lead to the creation of new law that no one could have predicted at the start . That , in fact , is a real possibility in the Microsoft case , which will undoubtedly wind up in the Supreme Court , thus giving the highest court in the land its first opportunity to rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , as an investor , willing to say that you know in advance what that Supreme Court will decide ? That 's exactly what Wall Street is doing when it pushes up Microsoft stock while this trial is ongoing . Ever since it went public in 1986 , Microsoft has been a great company and a great stock . It deserves a high multiple , and it deserves as well the veneration in which it is held by so many investors . What it does n't deserve , however , is this foolish rush to judgment-this seemingly unshakable belief that Microsoft will beat back the government just as it has beaten back its rivals over the years . What it does n't deserve is the sense that it can do no wrong . No stock ever warrants that kind of faith . Have n't we learned that by now ? <p>
