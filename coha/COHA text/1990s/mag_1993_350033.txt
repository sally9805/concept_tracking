With the head of an elephant and the body of a potbellied man , Lord Ganesha is one of Hinduism 's most beloved deities , a god of new beginnings and good luck . As his grotesque anatomy suggests , though , Ganesha , like India itself , was violently put together . Multitudes of peasants in the hinterland reaches of Maharashtra , a western Indian state that is home to the god 's most devout cult , had reason to recall his dual nature last week . Villagers concluding a 10-day festival in Ganesha 's honor celebrated late into the night with dancing , singing and blowing horns . In Killari , a village of about 15,500 near the Karnataka state border , the ceremonies culminated in the ritual dipping of * the god 's idols in the village pond . Around 1 a.m. , worshippers straggled home and fell into a deep slumber . <P> It was a sleep from which most of them never awoke .

When the quake hit , he clutched his string cot in terror , then turned to see nothing but a thick curtain of dust where his three-room house had stood . Before being knocked out by the collapsed awning , Singh could scarcely believe the convulsion 's power . He said later , " I thought the earth was an exploding bomb . " <P> In effect , it was .

Killari , the village nearest to the quake 's epicenter , was 90% flattened , reduced to heaps of brown-and-gray rubble . And Singh , like too many of the other survivors , had lost his entire family : his mother , wife , their two sons , daughters-in-law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toll were climbing beyond 28,000 , the worst quake disaster on the Indian subcontinent in 58 years . Too dumbstruck to weep , Singh pulled the corpses of his family members out of the debris and , as best he could , cremated them on the spot .
