<p> MATAMOROS , Mexico  --  He once was an Aldine high school student interested mostly in baseball . <p> In time he moved to the Valley and became bulletproof and invisible , or such was the purported benefit of his strange new religion . <p> Finally he captured world attention with unbelievable tales of ritual torture and human sacrifice on a small ranch outside of this Mexican border city . <p> Now Serafin Hernandez , all of 24 , is worried that his future is behind him . He proclaims his innocence , pleads for help and wonders whether he will be swallowed up forever in the Mexican prison system . <p> " " We 've been here for four years and we want to know what 's going to happen to us , " a well-dressed Hernandez said behind the bars of the " " penal viejo , " the aging prison where he and three other members of the notorious drug cult have been incarcerated since 1989 . " " We have rights . " But not the same ones he had before April 9 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a barbecue grill at an uncle 's house . <p> He was arrested by Mexican authorities at the ranch on drug charges but within days was telling them about a cult whose members believed they derived supernatural powers by murdering young men . <p> By the time digging was completed , 15 had been unearthed . <p> Ultimately he was charged with murder , kidnapping , illegal possession of firearms and drug trafficking . There were no U.S. charges against him or any of his alleged confederates . <p> Hernandez , a U.S. citizen , faces a significantly different legal system , one which includes a presumption of guilt and the lack of a trial . Under Mexican law , information and arguments are furnished to the judge by prosecuting and defense attorneys . A decision is rendered and a sentence handed down . That is supposed to happen within a year of arrest . <p> The judge assigned the case , Francisco Salvador Perez , said the time limit was extended because of the amount of evidence involved . He said it is " " already in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered no idea when . <p> " " It 's a very complicated and delicate case , but we 're working on it right now , " Perez said . " " It 's complicated because it branches into many different problems and many different people are accused . " <p> Perez said one of the reasons for the delay is a large amount of information presented by the attorneys for Hernandez and his co-defendants . <p> Others charged in the case are Hernandez 's uncle , Elio Hernandez Rivera , 26 ; Sergio Martinez , 27 ; and David Serna Valdez , 27 . Also charged is 28-year-old Sara Aldrete Villareal , who is in a Mexico City prison already serving a six-year sentence for criminal association . Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo , the charismatic " " godfather " of the drug cult , was killed in a shootout with police in Mexico City on May 6 , 1989 . <p> The story of the murderous cult exploded in the press in part because one of the victims was a University of Texas student , Mark Kilroy of Santa Fe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matamoros while on spring break . U.S. investigators said Hernandez talked willingly about the abduction and killing of Kilroy because he had no fear of police  --  his religion made him invincible  --  but today Hernandez recants it all . <p> He said he knew Constanzo only slightly . Ditto for Aldrete , the group 's so-called high priestess . <p> " " I am totally innocent , " said Hernandez , who graduated from Nimitz High School in 1986 and was a student at Texas Southmost College in Brownsville at the time of his arrest . " " I am totally innocent . I have been a student all my life . I am not a drug trafficker or murderer . We did n't do it . What can I say ? " <p> Reminded that he confessed on videotape to his involvement in the group and also was videotaped showing authorities the location of the buried bodies , Hernandez replied that he was tortured into cooperating . Specifically , he said he was beaten with rifle butts , shocked with an electrical device on his testicles and had water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I was gon na die , " he said . " " I was there ( in police custody ) for nine days and we would keep on getting tortured . We were forced to say all those things . " <p> As for the video at the ranch , Hernandez said he was given the information beforehand that he was to reveal . <p> " " Before we got there , they told me , " You 're gon na say this and point here . ' " <p> The videotape suggests a different story . Hernandez , appearing nonchalant and unrehearsed , is seen walking to various points around a large , fenced-in area at the ranch . The Mexican authorities accompanying him do not seem quite sure about what he is telling them , and they react with shock and disgust upon entering the shed where the ritual murders occurred . <p> " " If he did n't do it , how could he take us to a ranch 30 or 40 miles away , a ranch of 150 acres , and point to this spot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gavito , then a lieutenant with the Cameron County Sheriff 's Department and one of the lead U.S. investigators on the case . " " He was arrested for a dope deal . They ( Mexican authorities ) did n't know about any of this . " The other videotape shows a slightly nervous but forthcoming Hernandez describing to Gavito and an agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration how some of the victims were killed , including Kilroy . He admits to taking part in Kilroy 's abduction  - -  an admission he later repeated to reporters  --  and explains why Constanzo wanted an American student snatched for sacrifice . <p> " " If he ( the victim ) was going to be a student , he was going to make the spirits think better , " Hernandez told the investigators . <p> " " How many did you kill after Mark ? " one agent asked . <p> " " I think it was two , " Hernandez said . <p> He then described the abduction of Aldrete 's boyfriend and the precise nature of the mutilation the victim endured . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of torture and threats , on the tape he seems unmarked and uninjured , and there were no Mexican authorities in the room . <p> Further undermining his credibility is his family , many of whom have been involved in drug trafficking , according to authorities . His father , Serafin Hernandez Rivera , received a U.S. prison sentence in 1989 for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute . <p> Hernandez said officials with the U.S. consulate in Matamoros have not helped him . <p> " " I do n't think it 's going the way it should , me being a U.S. citizen . I should get help from somebody , " he said . <p> Janice Jacobs , the U.S. consul here , would not comment on the case directly , citing privacy laws , but she said there is little the consulate can do regarding Mexican legal matters . <p> If an American prisoner feels his case is not being handled properly , the consulate often will write the judge or prosecutor with the complaint and ask for an explanation , she said . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , " Jacobs said . <p> The response given to the consulate was the same explanation Perez offers the press : It has taken a long time to sort through the evidence . <p> " " I 'm in here and there is nothing I can do about it , " Hernandez said . " " I 'm happy that I 'm not dead , with all the torture . " <p> Hernandez said he has photos and a videotape to prove he was mistreated , though he has not provided such evidence to reporters . <p> Then again , proof of torture is not proof of innocence . <p> Gavito , now an investigator with the Cameron County district attorney 's office , has no doubts about Hernandez 's involvement in the murders . Nor does he have an ounce of sympathy for either his legal limbo or his claims that Mexican authorities abused him . <p> " " This guy deserves to get the ( expletive deleted ) beat out of him , " he said .
