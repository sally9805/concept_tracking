He made no pretense at being fully human . He had probably been born human , but now mechanical limbs  --  obvious prosthetics with no skinlike cover concealing their artificial nature  --  replaced his right arm and both legs , and the upper-right portion of his bald head was a shiny metal surface with a standard computer interface . He made no pretense at being friendly , either . He approached the members of Wraith Squadron as they sat , crammed into their booth , and with neither threat nor comment he snatched a wine bottle from the next table over and brought it down on Runt Ekwesh 's head . The bottle did n't break . It offered a musical toonk sound and coughed up a little wine from its open neck , and Runt , the furred alien with the long , big-toothed face , slumped in his seat , his eyes rolling up in his head . Most of the members of Wraith Squadron were pinned in place -- with nine pilots crammed into a circular booth built for five , they had little room to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ring from Runt , scrambled to his feet . Instead of diving toward his wingmate 's attacker , instead of charging with a fist cocked back to punch the man , he slid sideways toward his target , then came up in a side kick that caught the cyborg under his chin and lifted him clean off the floor , slamming him to the bar 's floor . Most of the members of the squadron slid out of the booth in Kell 's wake . Other patrons of the bar , human and otherwise , also rose , their expressions suggesting they were unclear on whether to join in this traditional form of bar entertainment . Commander Wedge Antilles , the squadron 's leader , stayed put . He turned toward the squadron medic , Ton Phanan -- the man with the mocking manner , well-trimmed beard and mustache , and prosthetic plate over the left side of his head . " How is he ? " Phanan shook his head as he delicately moved his fingers across Runt 's skull . " I do n't think anything 's cracked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard head . " The cyborg was up now . He and Kell were an odd contrast . The cyborg looked like a fatal skimmer-and-pedestrian accident whose remaining parts had been cobbled together by an insane mechanic , while Kell , with his classic blue eyes and sculpted features , his formidable height and obvious conditioning , looked like a holoposter for military recruitment . But their smiles were identical : humorless , cold , threatening . The cyborg reached into the next booth , past bar patrons who shrieked and ducked away , and yanked free the table bolted to the floor . He hauled it backward , then swung it faster than any human could manage , but Kell ducked forward , rolled under the table , came up on his feet a mere hand span in front of the cyborg , and planted one-two-three blows in his attacker 's gut . The cyborg staggered backward and Kell lashed out with a foot , kicking the table from his fingers with an ease that made the move look casual . The other bar patrons seemed to settle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bets . Wedge nodded over the wisdom of that choice . Though the Wraiths were in civilian clothes , it was obvious they were in good condition , and for all the patrons knew , Kell might be only typical of their fighting skill rather than one of their best hand-to-hand fighters . Piggy , the Gamorrean pilot , leaned back against the Wraiths ' table to watch the proceedings -- to the extent that the semipermanent smoky haze hovering at chest level and above permitted easy viewing . He glanced over his shoulder at Runt . " Is he hurt ? " His voice emerged both as incomprehensible grunts and as electronic words , the latter being emitted by a nearly invisible speaker implanted in his throat . " Everybody asks that , " Phanan complained . Through with his examination of Runt 's skull , he now shone a small light into Runt 's eyes one by one . " Nobody ever says , ' What a mess ! I hope the doctor is not emotionally harmed by having to deal with it . ' He 's coming around . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to look up information on how his species deals with concussions . " The cyborg 's next punch , the second part of a skillful one-two combination , connected with Kell 's midsection . The big man spun as he was hit , diminishing the punch 's power , and used that spin to add force to his reply , a snap kick . The cyborg took it in the sternum and staggered back , looking outraged . Kell bent over , holding his stomach where hit , and then straightened , obviously in pain . Then the bar was filled with uniforms -- a stream of men and women pouring in the main entrance , dressed in the distinctive outfit of New Republic Military Police . Wedge sighed . " As deep as we are , they arrived pretty quickly . " Phanan held a small rose-colored vial full of liquid under Runt 's broad , flat nose . The nonhuman 's nostrils flared and he jerked , reflexively trying to get away from the smell . " Easy , Runt , " he said . " We 're about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the company of some charming people , too , I 'll bet . " Wedge grinned . The military police led them out of the smoke-filled bar into the only slightly less oppressive atmosphere of street-level Coruscant . It was raining , a steady spray of liquid that felt like three-quarters rainwater and one-quarter vehicle lubricant . Wedge looked up , trying to spot some distant speck of color representing Coruscant 's sky , but all he could see were clifflike building sides rising to infinity . Awnings , high roads , bridges between skyscrapers , and other obstacles blocked out any glimpse of clouds far above , yet still the rain came down , much of it probably runoff from rain gutters , vents , and flues far above . Tyria Sarkin , the slender woman with the blond ponytail , grimaced . " It would be nice to be posted to a clean world next , " she said . Then she saw the military policemen gesturing toward the waiting skimmer , a slab-sided model without viewports , used to transport prisoners , and she obligingly followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still-dizzy Runt , fell in behind her , and Wedge and the cyborg who had caused all the trouble brought up the rear .
