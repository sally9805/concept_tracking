Can we develope a sane energy strategy for the future ? <p> The heater whirred on high in the white Pontiac Le Mans as I drove snow-blown route 82 from basalt , Colorado , to a Conoco station . Unleaded regular was a buck forty-five a gallon . I was on my way to a Shangri-la of energy research , the Rocky Mountain Institute ( RMI ) , headed by Armory and Hunter Lovins . I crept uphill toward the institute 's icy driveway . The institute 's palatial atrium features a lush tropical garden decorated with a two-foot iguana and a fertile banana plant . Thanks to passive solar technologies , the building exudes light and warmth  --  yet lacks a furnace or boiler of any kind . Saving energy does n't mean having to say you 're sorry . <p> Bespectacled and benevolent looking , Amory Lovins appears more like the physicist he once was than an energy maverick . But this stubborn advocate of renewable resources and the efficient use of energy has proved one of the most persistent gadflies for the special oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's approach to energy . " We must learn to make the best energy buys first , " he argues , pointing out that RMI 's electric bill comes to a mere five dollars per month . " That means starting with efficiency measures to reduce the need for more production , and then moving away from large central power plants to smaller ones that make use of such renewable resources as wind and sunlight , and highly efficient gas turbines fueled with biomass like sugarcane and other crops . " <p> Such a shift , of course , would change the world . Peking man used fire as early as 400,000 B.C. From then on , burning carbon-based materials has been mankind 's most basic technology . But today , as the world 's burgeoning population escalates its energy use , fire 's effects threaten our environment and increasingly raise serious economic and security concerns . <p> " Energy is not the goal per se , " says John H. Gibbons , director of the Office of Technology Assessment . " Rather , energy policy derives from the broader and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and national security . Therefore it only makes sense to develop a national energy strategy that does the best job of fulfilling these three goals . " In other words , policymakers can fashion a rational approach to the energy crisis only by examining the options in light of each of the underlying issues . <p> During the next 40 years , Gibbons , Lovins , and other experts urge , we must undertake a major transition away from carbon-based fuels and wasteful energy consumption practices . If we do not , we run the risk of using up the earth 's capacity to absorb the destructive by-products of burning . <p> The other risk of ignoring their pleas is proclaimed in today 's headlines : We went to war at least partially to secure the millions of barrels of oil imported daily from the Persian Gulf . But this did n't have to happen , Lovins says . As he put it in a New York Times editorial last December , " Are we putting our kids in tanks because we did n't put them in efficient cars ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Persian Gulf after 1985 if we 'd simply kept on saving oil at the rate we did from 1977 through 1985 . " <p> It 's clear that alternatives to carbonfuel-based power generation will be filling the energy gap-but not because our traditional fuels are running low . Based on current recoverable reserves and consumption rates , the planet has nearly a century of oil left , maybe 200 years worth of coal , and 50 to 100 years of natural gas . " The scarcity issue is really a red herring , " Princeton energy analyst Robert Williams says . " However , these resources will become increasingly scarce vis-a-vis the security and environmental constraints . " <p> Security constraints mean that the fuel you want belongs to someone else . While 80 percent of the world 's coal is in the United States , the Soviet Union , and China , oil and natural gas reserves are predominantly in the Middle East . <p> Historically , this distribution of resources has had its price-in money and , all too often , in blood . At this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil supplies . The bill for the Gulf War has already topped $40 billion , in effect doubling the annual cost of this " cheap " Middle Eastern oil . As WorldWatch 's Christopher Flavin points out about the region 's resources , " Not only is the world addicted to cheap oil , but the largest drugstore is in a very dangerous neighborhood . " <p> War itself , of course , exacts an environmental toll . Ecological damage from history 's largest oil slick , offshore from Kuwait , dwarfs the effects of such peacetime mishaps as the grounding of the Exxon Valdez . And no one would rush into a hot landing zone to engage in the tricky business of mopping up a spill or putting out an oil well fire . <p> Even in peacetime the ecological impact of burning fossil fuel is bad news . CO2 emissions account for about half the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion , as well as most acid rain and general urban smog . Air pollution is not only unpleasant but costly . The American Lung Association , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost productivity and other health costs . Estimates of damage from acid rain on buildings , bridges , and forests easily double this price tag . <p> Global warming , another effect of burning oil , ca n't be measured in dollars . Burning the remaining stores of oil , coal , and natural gas would result in a tenfold rise in the concentration of atmospheric C02 , Flavin says . Seven of the last ten years were the hottest on record . Even without catastrophes from rising sea levels or melting polar ice caps , researchers predict climate changes that , within the next century , could well turn cropland to desert , flood populated coastlines , and cause major social and economic dislocations . <p> Nor will holding to current per capita consumption of these energy sources offer a viable option . EPA scientists , for example , have estimated that global carbon emissions kill have to drop by 60 to 80 percent to stabilize the climate . Combine that with the recent World Energy Conference 's estimate that by the year 2020 the world 's population growth ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion ) will require a 75 percent increase in energy use , and the scope of the power problem emerges . <p> Fortunately , nonpolluting alternatives to fossil fuels exist . The primary contenders are nuclear energy and renewables , including wind , solar , and biomass . Traditionally , the government has favored nuclear energy over renewables . <p> Through Department of Energy research and development funding , large tax subsidies , and legislative limits on liability from radiation accidents , nuclear power has enjoyed a huge advantage over its more modest competitors . In the last 20 years , Lovins says , taxpayers have coughed up almost $90 billion in 1991 dollars on nuclear technology ; the electric utility industry has spent more than $125 billion . <p> But this may have been an unwise investment . According to Lovins , utilities have now written off more than $60 billion on nuclear power plants . Beyond that , running nuclear plants costs at least $60 billion more than using coal power to generate the same amount of electricity . Altogether Lovins estimates that the damage totals more than $200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging plants and clean up waste . " One can describe the state of the nuclear industry as the greatest collapse of any enterprise in industrial history , " he says . " The nuclear industry has largely succeeded in bankrupting its only possible customers , the electric utilities . " <p> This condemnation does n't come from an industry outsider , either . " Thinking about that tragedy makes me feel that there but for the grace of God go I , " Lovins says . " In my student days I received awards for nuclear physics from , among others , General Electric , the Atomic Energy Commission , and the American Nuclear Society . " <p> Proponents of this technology have correctly argued that it could address the environmental problems associated with fossil fuel : Nuclear power , after all , does not produce greenhouse gases . But it has other significant problems . " Nuclear power , reincarnated in some smaller , passively safe , and economical form , may indeed come to the rescue , at least for the developed countries , " says James MacKenzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Energy , and Pollution Program . " But we wo n't see this for at least twenty years . And nuclear energy is inherently expensive , complicated , and unsuitable for most of the developing world . Saddam Hussein also awakened us to the threat of diverting nuclear materials to weapons production . " <p> Renewable fuels and technologies , however , have no such economic or national security drawbacks . Even without huge research dollars and tax subsidies , solar , wind , biomass , and other renewable industries have made great strides in the last decade . Moreover , ever more efficient devices have trickled onto the market . Were there no tax subsidies for fossil and nuclear power , existing solar and wind-generated electricity , to name just two sources , would already prove cost competitive , <p> The move toward renewables began with the 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act ( PURPA ) , which forced utilities to buy power from anyone who generated it . Since then the percentage of electricity supplied by private producers has jumped-limited more by restrictions on what they could sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea , the utilities are recognizing the bottom line . Power from solar and wind-generating facilities is competitive with and in the near future will be cheaper than the same electricity produced by traditional generating plants . The 1990 Clean Air Act should make renewable sources even more economically attractive , <p> Changing attitudes among state regulators have also enhanced the climate for fuel alternatives . California , Oregon , and five New England states , among others , now encourage utilities to invest in the hidden " source " of energy : greater efficiency . In Oregon 's " nega watts " program , for example , a utility company representative can sit down with a building owner and work out a plan to increase energy efficiency by investing in less power-consuming lights , heating plants , and the like . The owner pays for the improvements over time through his regular utility bill . <p> Such programs allow utilities to charge for the watts they sell and for efficiency investments ( the watts that they do n't sell ) . The advantage : The utility does n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle the increasing load . The risk : Future power consumption might decline , sticking the utility with unsellable surplus capacity . This is no idle fear . Just such a situation has pushed a number of U.S. utility companies over or to the brink of bankruptcy . <p> In large measure , such economic dilemmas come from an important shift in the relationship between growth and energy . Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , GNP and energy consumption have risen hand in hand . However , since the first oil shock in 1973 this trend has changed : GNP has risen as energy consumption has fallen . Advances in energy efficiency are only part of the story . People are also manufacturing and consuming items with costs based less on the raw material and energy required for their fabrication , and more on the labor or ingenuity involved in their production . Although computers , for example , require a lot less raw matter and energy to make and use than refrigerators , they cost more . <p> The solution to the energy crises , therefore , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the price of electricity and gas inevitably rises , individuals will opt for more efficient energy use in the products they buy . With the increasing cost of environmental controls as well as big-ticket fossil and nuclear power plants , the utilities will seek cheaper , smaller , and cleaner ways to provide energy  --  or go broke . <p> Quite likely , long-term solutions to the energy crisis will involve a sweeping move away from the carbon-based fuels that energized human development from prehistoric times to the industrial age . Amory Lovins and other energy revolutionaries envision a panorama of wind-mills on the Great Plains , solar cells in the desert producing electricity , and fields that turn crops into ethanol for our cars and turbine fuel for power . <p> Energizing the future : Economical power will come Increasingly from the sun , the earth 's steaming interior , the wind , and such biomass fuels as agricultural wastes and cattle manure , among other sources . Clean nuclear power may be priced out of the market . <p> By TOM DWORETZKEY <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
