THE RED BLOTCH ABOVE AUSTRALIA AND NEW GUINEA in this satellite image , released last week , represents the ocean 's hottest water , at 30 degreesC ( 86 degrees F ) . That 's unusually steamy , and it may be partly a result of the global warming that scientists think is on its way . The good news : NASA reports that the ozone hole feared over northern latitudes this spring never showed up , but only because the winter was warmer than usual . A cooler season next year , which is quite possible , and goodbye ozone .
