<p> ANYONE walking past this slim , fresh-faced , simply dressed young woman would have a hard time believing that she has starred as a madam , a murderer , a sluttish mistress , a prostitute , an abortionist , an insane Swiss artist and now that classic French symbol of a desperately frustrated and passionate woman , Madame Bovary . <p> When a visitor expressed pleasure that Isabelle Huppert looked considerably warmer than the cool-eyed , avaricious heroine of her 45th movie , the actress rose to the defense of Emma Bovary . " She was n't cold , " Huppert declared . " The situation was cold . I think she looks harsh and greedy sometimes because she 's emotional . She 's always on the verge of crying . Maybe you did n't see the same film I did . " <p> The ninth and reputedly most faithful screen version of Gustav Flaubert 's famous novel will open Christmas Day at the Vogue Theater . It is based on the true story of a country doctor 's bored and faithless wife who ran up excessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in despair . <p> Director Claude Chabrol 's conscientious rendering is unlikely to create the stir the novel caused when it was published in 1857 . The author and the magazine that serialized " Madame Bovary " were put on trial for commiting an " outrage to public morals and religion . " They were acquitted and the book became an international success . <p> Today bovarysme is defined in the Larousse dictionary as " the comportment of those who are led by dissatisfaction to ambitious reverie . " <p> " For me , it 's about the fight for being free , " Huppert said , tucking her black-stockinged legs under her . " I saw her as a fighter , a survivor . I certainly did n't see her as a romantic person being a little bold , having lovers . I saw her as somebody who has a consciousness of the mediocrity around her and wants to get out of it . I think it was interesting to emphasize her potential smartness . " <p> Huppert looked more like an unspoiled college coed , in her modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most sought-after French actress . She 's the female counterpart to the omnipresent Gerard Depardieu , with whom she co-starred in " Loulou " and " Going Places . " <p> Speaking softly in her lightly accented English , she noted that Emma Bovary was " not smart in the sense that she puts things in perspective and she 's not smart in the sense that she 's intellectual , but she 's decided that she should get her yearnings and desires fulfilled . She does everything in her power to do so but the problem is that her power is very limited . I was touched by her because the limitation of her mind is the limitation of her life . She lives in an extraordinarily misogynist and limited society . She 's totally dependent on the men around her and yet they 're pathetic and mediocre and they do n't understand her . When you have to face such a reality , you may have to be a little harsh sometimes and that 's how I wanted to portray her . " <p> Huppert believes that Flaubert was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of what was going to be the feminist fight to be free from a certain kind of bourgeois marriage . " <p> In the 18th century , women were allowed to have freedom , she noted , " but then came the little bourgeoisie of the 19th century . They really imprisoned women . I think ' Madame Bovary ' is the emblematic story of this destiny and a clear metaphor for what the feminine condition was . " <p> She hopes it has changed , but says , " We 're still in a man 's world and have to fight against men 's standards . It 's not everywhere but even in my business , it 's often in a man 's hands . Of course , I have a certain power and have a big role in what I want to do . That 's my way of being free , but it does n't happen without fights . " <p> Her independence is manifest in her response to questions about her personal life . She 'll say that she has an 8-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when asked if it 's a long-term relationship . <p> " It 's my freedom to entitle myself not to answer . I know that in America they do . It 's so weird  --  it 's like somebody coming into my bathroom . " <p> HUPPERT does n't call herself a feminist because she 's " a little suspicious " of that label . " You say ' feminist ' and people think of a warrior . I 'm not a warrior . Yet in my behavior and in my thoughts , there is something of a feminist . The feminists did all the work before and now the path is more or less clear . " <p> The youngest of five daughters in a conventional Parisian bourgeois household , Huppert had an early exposure to the arts but never thought she would become an actress . Surprisingly , her first film did n't discourage her forever . In her early 20s , she played one of five heiresses kidnaped off a yacht by the Palestine Liberation Organization in Otto Preminger 's 1975 bomb " Rosebud . " She thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow actors . She was interested in Robert Mitchum 's poetry and , when he quit the cast , enjoyed working with Peter O'Toole . <p> A number of heavy-duty dramas followed , including " The Lacemaker , " " The Judge and the Assassin , " " Coup de Torchon , " " Every Man for Himself , " " Aloise , " " Entre Nous , " " Cactus " and two directed by Chabrol , " The Story of Women " and " Violette , " which won a Cannes Film Festival prize for her performance as a woman who murdered her father and almost killed her mother . <p> In " The Story of Women " ( 1989 ) , one of her favorite films , she played a coldhearted mother who became an abortionist in order to support her two small children in the grim era of defeat for the French at the beginning of World War II . Eventually , she is brought before a Vichyite tribunal to answer for her actions . <p> WHEN Huppert came to America to promote that film , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded weird to me since abortion in France is free . Certain people are against abortions , but legally women ca n't be prevented from having them . It 's very strange that it 's an issue in this country . I 'm not saying that abortion is a good thing to do , but I think all women should be allowed to make their own choice . I never thought the film was about abortion , but about somebody who tries to survive in a difficult period of French history . " <p> She believes that Chabrol shares some of the qualities of the women directors with whom she has enjoyed working . " He has a great ability to let your personality come to the surface without saying anything . He has a great insight into what you really are . It 's like he was looking through my soul . I think we both have a tendency to show character as it is without trying to enhance reality . He is a humanist , too , because that 's how you draw humanistic portraits  --  by being realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment , Huppert seems to be specializing in depicting women involved with more than one man . After " Madame Bovary , " she starred in " Malina , " Werner Schroeter 's film based on an autobiographical novel by Austrian poet Ingeborg Bachmann , who lived for years with Swiss playwright Max Frisch . <p> " The two men in her book were projections of people she had relationships with . Her character is very extreme and ca n't really deal with reality and people . She lives with a man and gets protection from him but falls madly in love with someone else . It 's mostly a movie about death and desire and destruction . It 's done in an operatic way , but it 's very beautiful visually . " <p> She is also in the middle of shooting " After Love , " directed by Diane Kurys , with whom she made " Entre Nous . " It 's about the generation who went through the revolutionary events of May ' 68 and are trying to reconcile that experience with their more conventional lives now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , was very touched by those events . " It was the first consciousness I had of politics and of a social reality and what you could expect from the society . It was a very important time even though it 's all gone now . Everybody had great hopes for a better world . It was very naive in a sense but it was a very happy time . " <p> She plays a writer who leads a double life , linked to the man she 's living with but in love with someone else . " It 's not a statement about being married or not being married , but it deals more with emotional options . The characters are pragmatic , but they are attracted to romanticism . All the people who went through ' 68 remained with their ideals for a long time and had a certain purity of feeling what life should be , but it changed by the end of the ' 80s . A new generation was more interested in success and making money . I learned how to compromise in order @ @ @ @ @ @
