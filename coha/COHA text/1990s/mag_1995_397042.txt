Sea change " is one of those buzzphrases used to describe a radical transformation . In its " archaic " dictionary meaning , a sea change is simply " a change brought about by the sea . " This definition reminds us that the real change occurs not only on the surface but also in the unseen depths . In other words , stories of genuine transformation will not always appear on the evening news . Almost without notice the Convention on the Law of the Sea ( LOS )  --  opened for signature in 1982  --  was ratified in 1993 by the requisite 60 nations and went into effect on November 16 , 1994 . The U.S. is not yet a party to this treaty that it once did mucin to promote . The Senate will debate the issue this year . The result of the most extensive negotiation process in history and one of the most significant developments in international law , the LOS points to a global transformation at once political , economic and legal . For tbose conjnced , as I am , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics , economics and law , the LOS may be construed as a religious event as well . Sea law is nearly as old as international law itself , dating back to the Byzantine Rhodian Codes in the seventh or eighth centuries . Given early trade between East and West , R.P. Anand has argued , it may also be anchored in ancient South Asian culture . International law of the oceans matured significantly , however , in the 17th century . In part on theological grounds , Hugo Grotius and others established the " freedom of the high seas " doctrine  --  a sort of " fish and let fish , trade and let trade " rule for the oceans beyond a very narrow strip of water under recognized national jurisdiction . In the past 50 years , however , political and technological developments have produced , in the language of Thomas Kuhn , " anomalies " that established sea law could not handle . These have included massive pollution of the oceans , the prospect of placing nuclear weapons on the ocean floor , and advances in fishing technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over fishing rights . The depletion of fish stocks dashed the assumption that ocean resources are inexhaustible  --  an assumption , consistent with a Lockean view of property , upon which the freedom-of-the-seas doctrine was implicitly based . The most significant development , however , was the discovery of polymetallic nodules on the deep seabed  --  a sector of the earth which previously neither human beings nor human law had reached . In the 1960s scientists and entrepreneurs projected that these potato-sized lumps of ore ( zinc , manganese and copper , among others ) represented vast untapped wealth . But their presence also raised profound questions : Who should have access to the deep seabed ? Who should benefit from its hidden wealth ? Whose oceans are these , anyway ? Such questions were made more urgent by unilateral claims of jurisdiction over coastal waters extending far beyond limits set by established norms , and by the eagerness of private and state-sponsored mining companies to stake their claims to the seabed 's mineral wealth . A key moment in the history of the LOS came in 1967 when Malta 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Assembly a speech about the need for a new sea law . Pardo reminded the assembled nations that " the dark oceans were the womb of life : from the protecting oceans , life ernerged . We still bear in our bodies  --  in our blood , in the salty bitterness of our tears  --  the marks of this remote past . Retracing the earth , man is now returning to the ocean depths . His penetration of the deep could mark the beginning of the end of man , and indeed for life as we know it on this earth : it could also be a unique opportunity to lay solid foundations for a peaceful and increasingly prosperous future for all peoples . " If the new oceans regime that Pardo envisioned was to be a " sea change " for human consciousness and law , it would have to be archaic in the most radical sense : it would have to be founded not only on anthropocentric principles , but on much " older " biocentric and geocentric principles as well . Pardo suggested that the deep seabed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humankind . " Common heritage was regarded by international lawyers as a novel concept . The only real precedents for the idea were fuzzy references in recent outer-space law . Its meaning for prospective ocean law was unclear . Still , the concept was accepted in 1970 as a negotiating principle that ruled out appropriation of the deep seabed by individual states and required that it be used for peaceful purposes only . The common-heritage principle also meant that " the exploration of the deep seabed and the exploitation of its resources shall be carried on for the benefit of mankind as a whole . " The principle further required that exploration and exploitation ought to take into special consideration " the interests and needs of the developing countries . " Finally , the principle bore an implicit but widely accepted understanding of commitment to future generations . Philip Allott , a member of the United Kingdom delegation during the negotiations , has argued that , despite the usual jostling of state interests , elements of collective human consciousness that regards a " whole " as greater than the sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allott surely had Pardo 's contributions in mind . The search for an intellectual grounding for the pivotal common-heritage concept inevitably leads to that which transcends both the natural world and the human race . One dares to call the LOS a religious event : if the earth is the heritage of humankind , what  --  or who  --  is the benefactor ? Not past generations , ultimately , for whence did they receive this gift ? Not nature , ultimately , for whence comes the natural world ? And if the claim is that the goods of the earth are given to humankind as a whole , from what vantage point can people regard the whole if not from a transcendent viewpoint ? And if this grand heritage is given especially to the poor among us , as the treaty seems to indicate then what kind of gift-giver are we dealing with ? Despite its shortcomings , the LOS does , then , begin to project a new world order , one that surpasses the interstate model that has reigned since the Peace of Westphalia ( 1648 ) , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Projecting new worlds , we might recall , is the business of religion . The sea has often been the subject of religious discourse and imagery . The Hebrew and Christian scriptures , for instance , present the sea as a meeting place of the human with the divine . Our Greek and Roman heritage , a cradle of international law , is replete with gods and goddesses from the sea . The sea serves the human imagination as mythos , a reality that cries out for yet resists a marriage with logos  --  with reason , order , telos , law . Though few international lawyers would describe it as such , the LOS represents the interplay of mythos and logos , ocean and order , chaos and cosmos , nature and human artifact . To a religious eye the LOS is a movement toward global transformation that transcends the law and politics in which such transformation germinates and may come to birth . The vision of a common humanity sharing and caring for a common sea is one thing , its realization is another . As the negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree of sovereignty , the treaty ran up against a resurgence of liberal economic philosophy . In 1981 the Reagan administration called for a review of U.S. involvement in the negotiations and in 1982 chose not to sign the treaty . Seabed mining was the major sticking point . At the same time , Third World nations were becoming increasingly concerned about their sovereignty over coastal waters . As a result of these developments , the area to be designated humankind 's common heritage shrunk dramatically : claims for extended national sovereignty over coastal waters were written into the treaty in the modified form of 200-mile Economic Enterprise Zones . Since 1990 the U.S. and other nations have worked with the UN to make less restrictive the section of the treaty having to do with seabed mining . Last July , President Clinton signed an agreement regarding these changes , and in October sent the 1982 convention and the agreement to the Senate for advice and consent . This year the Senate will debate the merits of ratifying what many have called a " constitution for the oceans . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . Philip Allott maintains that the LOS provides us with an invitation to think about the sea in a new way : as neither the mare liberum ( " open sea " ) proposed by Grotius , nor the mare clausum ( " closed sea " ) defended by his intellectual adversary , John Selden , but as mare nostrum- " our sea . " It is ours not in the sense of possession but in the sense of participation and integration , in the sense of the critical relationship that humanity has with the earth and its oceans . With the recent shift of mood and power in Washington , it will be interesting to see how Senate debate over the Law of the Sea is handled . Will policymakers be able to see beyond national interest to the interests of humankind , especially the poor ? Will the oceans be deemed " ours " in terms of relationship rather than possession ? Will politicians allow the numinous power ofthe oceans to speak ? William P.
