Section : skin fitness <p> Blemishes do n't discriminate by age , sex  --  or anything else . They happen to 15-year-olds before the prom and to 45-year-old executives before board meetings . But if they 're only an occasional problem , you can help solve it yourself by using a simple prevention/treatment program . FIRST , DO NO HARM We 're talking about those frustrating , isolated blemishes , or pimples , that dermatologists call grade-1 acne . Your main goal should be to keep these lone blemishes from turning into full-blown acne . <p> Unfortunately , it 's easy to take a simple , mild case of acne and make it into a messy condition by doing the wrong thing . <p> " The worst thing that most people do is to overscrub their skin , " says Nelson Lee Novick , M.D. , associate clinical professor of dermatology , Mt . Sinai School of Medicine . " I recommend that my patients do not use washcloths or polyester scrub sponges . You should just wash gently with your fingertips and lightly pat dry with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaps or cleansers , either . They only irritate the whitehead . Instead , you should use a very mild soap  --  like one of those designed for sensitive skin . In short , there is no magic to cleansing  --  it 's just removing surface dirt and oil  --  it wo n't make your acne disappear . " <p> Whiteheads are underneath the surface of the skin but are embedded too deeply to be uprooted by cleansing . " If you vigorously scrub your skin to unseat them , you end up with the same number of blemishes , but you may rupture the whitehead below the surface , triggering the whole acne cascade , " says Dr. Novick . <p> If you understand the chain reaction known as the acne cascade , you 'll see why it 's important to avoid it . " Think of the whitehead ( made up of materials including oil-gland secretions , bacteria , fatty acids and dead skin cells ) as a piece of TNT underneath your skin in the hair follicle . <p> " The detonator can be anything from nervous tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Dr. Novick . " Once the whitehead is triggered , the materials accumulate in it like water insidea closed balloon . <p> " The acne bacteria then have more material to break down into irritating fatty acids . Those fatty acids help to annoy and attack the remaining intact wall of the whitehead and eventually it ruptures , spewing its contents under the surface of your skin . " <p> This spillage , in turn , signals the body to attack the foreign material , causing an inflammatory reaction that may result in pimples , pustules , cysts and eventually scarring . Another problem with overcleansing is that you can end up with extremely dry skin . This is a double whammy because acne medications  --  OTC or prescription  --  tend to dry your skin . " Couple that with overzealous scrubbing and you can end up with skin that 's like the Mojave Desert and far too sensitive to put any of the topical medications on , " says Dr. Novick . <p> Other inappropriate measures include steaming the skin or anything that excites these spots below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the surface is opened mechanically , which I do n't recommend people do for themselves , " says Dr. Novick . " So it explodes below the surface , starting the acne cascade . " <p> A common misconception is that the sun will have some beneficial effect on blemishes . In fact , the ultraviolet rays that penetrate the skin 's surface can damage the follicles , closing them off and triggering an acne flare-up . Since it usually happens two to four weeks after sun exposure , people do n't usually relate the insult from the sun to the breakout . Of course , wrinkles and skin cancer are also results of sun exposure . KEEP SKIN BALANCED <p> Acne starts well below the surface.So drying out the surface  --  which is , unfortunately , what many acne medications do as a side effect to their benefits ( their antibiotic , unclogging actions )  --  is not necessarily a good thing . One way to counteract this side effect is to use a moisturizer . <p> " Use a moisturizer that 's oil-free , hypoallergenic and fragrance-free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or noncomedogenic on their labels , which means that they wo n't promote blemishes . I usually recommend a simple formula  --  like a fragrance-free , hypoallergenic , noncomedogenic moisture lotion . The fewer ingredients , the less your skin has to react to . I 'd suggest that you use your acne preparations at night and the moisturizer in the morning . The fact is , anything you put on your face should be simple . " OVER-THE-COUNTER HELP <p> In an OTC antiblemish product , you should choose one that has the one-two punch of an antibacterial and an unclogging effect . <p> " Look for something with 2.5 percent benzoyl peroxide , which is probably one of the most effectiveantiblemish medications , " says Dr. Novick . " And look for a product that contains sulfur , sulfur and salicylic acid , or resorcinol , which are antibacterials and pore uncloggers . " <p> When should you seek professional help ? " If after two to four weeks of using an appropriate , mild antiacne regimen , cleansing properly and protecting from overexposure to the sun , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an irritation from what you 're doing , that would be the time to get yourself to a dermatolo-gist and have it checked out , " says Dr. Novick . <p> By Pamela Boyer <p> GENTLE CLEANSING FOR TROUBLED SKIN <p> Vigorous cleansing of your face can do much more harm than good . Resist the impulse to scrub and follow these simple steps to a clearer complexion : Wash your hands . You would n't wash with a dirty facecloth . Choose sensitive-skin bars or sensitive-skin liquid cleansers . Moisten your face with lukewarm water to allow the cleanser to disperse more evenly . Work your cleanser into a lather with your hands ; this helps save you from rubbing your face . Gently wash your face , using just the pads of your fingertips to distribute the lather . Rinse thoroughly by splashing your face with lukewarm water until the lather is completely gone . Pat dry gently . <p> PHOTO : A woman washing her face . <p>                    @
