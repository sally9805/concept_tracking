i The air these nights , though it is already November , just shivers with mosquitoes . And the stinkbugs ! Sometimes late at night it sounds like a Ping-Pong game , those tough little shells tock-tocking against the screens . What you reckon I got in here they could want or need ? That 's anyhow why I did n't get up right off and run to the door when the tapping started . Figured the bugs was just hankering after something again . But when the screen door rattled , I knew somebody had a mind to open it . " You stay right where you are , " I said . " I mean it . " " Leandra ? " My name blew in from the porch on a breath of a breeze that had cooled down to just right for sleeping . My heart knew right away who it was , but the rest of me somehow refused the knowing . I set down the scrap of doll 's dress , a bedragglement of loose lace hem , got up . I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one step closer to the door . " What business you think you got here ? " I said . I was staring hard for some reason at the dolls lined up on the mourners ' bench , its stern length taking up the wall between me and the porch . The dolls come in earlier that week -- the afflicted , the sick , and the sorry , waiting to be saved . A pitiful sight , the lot of them , mostly stark naked and some in pieces . One lady in a mildewed petticoat was holding her head in her lap . I 'm grown right tired of trying to work miracles , I thought . " Leandra ? " The whisper again , door rattling . " It 's me . " " Had better not be , " was all I could say , and my hands were shaking . Then I heard the laugh , knew it for Wim 's , and with it , like always , came the end of any good sense I ever had . I went and unlatched the screen . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold open the door for a man could only be here because he intended to ruin my life . And his .  - -  April it was when I first went to Massachusetts , but it felt like winter to me . I was twenty-one years old and had never once been out of North Carolina except up to Norfolk , and my mama gone but six months . It might have calmed me down some had Branch been there to carry me to the airport . But Branch was off at Fort Bragg that year and not available to be leaned on . When Miss Maude Ellen 's nephew Vern put me on that plane in Norfolk , I very nearly cried right out there in public . I 'd never gone even so far as to picture myself on an airplane . " You make it back in one piece , I 'll maybe try it myself one day , " Vern said . I asked him did he want my ticket then and there . " I ai n't in no hurry , " he told me , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ten years ago now , but I do n't guess I 'll ever get over it . Where I flew to was Boston , and it still about strangles my heart to recollect how close that airplane come to landing on sheer water . They ought to build airports in a place gives a little more seam allowance , is what I think . This man was sitting next to me -- wearing a brown suit and a spotty necktie , I recall -- and he patted my knee when the plane bumped down and sighed with more relief than I myself was prepared to feel . " Terra firma , " he said . I nodded . " Pleased , " I said . A few minutes later , the man helped me get Mama 's vanity case down from the curved bin above our seats , and I said , " Thank you kindly , Mr. Terrafirma , " and I never got the gist of his giddy smile , not at all like a businessman , until way later when my brother-in-law , who is Wim , or was then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terra firma is solid ground : I know that now . But it feels like something I have n't stood on since I was a child .  - -  The yellow porch light I thought I shut off hours before made his olive skin look brassy . It jaundiced his eyes and coated his teeth and tainted the streaks of white in his wiry hair . The only thing that yellow bulb did n't do was keep the bugs away like it was meant to . The chinch bugs bounced off the screen . The mosquitoes and moths congregated around his face . Wim stood there in all that mess and stared in at me like I could save him . " Just what do you think you 're doing here , I 'd like to know , " I said . He nodded like he was agreeing I had every right to ask . He looked like something the cat dragged in ... rode hard and put away wet , through the mill , to hell and back , were other ideas that occurred to me . But Wim , who teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys are rich and no girls are allowed , who once even wrote a book of poems printed in New York City when he was scarcely more than a boy himself and ca n't seem to get over it ... well , Wim is death on what he calls cliches and he 's made it hard for me not to notice them and it seems like my mouth has never worked right since . If you 're disallowed to call a spade a spade , what in the world are you supposed to call it ? So I just stood there gaping at him , my mouth like a drain that was all clogged up with these words did n't have a thing wrong with them except they 'd been used a bit , like something you 'd run across at a rummage sale on a lucky day . Another long minute went by . Then Wim came to , I guess , because he slapped at a mosquito on his forehead and his hand came away bloody and a red blossom bloomed above his eyebrow , blackish in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hurt his face . My God , he 's grown to be a beautiful old man . " I guess you 'd best come in , " I said , " seeing as you 're here . " And I did hold the door for him ; it was only common courtesy .  - -  It seems like only yesterday ... that is a cliche for certain . They suck the blood out of language , Wim says , which is why we need to kill them . But plain English is all I got to tell this , and words like that , ready made , are only shortcuts to get you quicker where you want to go , is what I think . And seeing as I do n't care to dawdle overlong in dark places , I got to tell it in my own quick way . Do n't I ? That April winter up north is something I caught a chill from and my bones still feel it , is all I can say . It was Good Friday when I got there . Everything was slicked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still does -- was waiting on a baby , and things was going poorly . Wim , the husband she 'd been married to for eight years but who I never met before ( and Mama never did ) , had to fetch me from the airport due to how Pammy Jo had to keep in bed for the last weeks before the baby came . Which was , Wim said , forgetting himself , no picnic . He knew me right away . I figured Pammy must have showed him my picture , maybe he 'd studied it before he left to the airport , memorizing my gray eyes that I wish was a bit wider apart , my plain straight hair that 's the color of the weathered slats of Kepners ' tobacco barn , my mouth that Pammy said once would make a good advertisement for the kissing booth at the county fair ( only now , with harassment and all , it 's only the mayor and the tax collector in that booth -- them that gets paid to get harassed , Branch says ) . My mouth anyhow , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to look at . After Mama passed on I 'd started wearing a touch of lipstick . It made me look different , I thought . But my sister 's husband who 'd never laid eyes on me picked me right out of a crowd . My eyes had passed him by , an older man in a dark-blue overcoat , with little drops of water spotting the lenses of his eyeglasses . But he come up to me straightaway . " You 're Leandra , " he said . His voice and his face were so full of certainty , all I could think was it would be awful to have to tell him he was wrong . But Wim is n't wrong much . Not about small things . " So I am , " I said . When I try to think back how his face looked to me that first moment , seems like all I can recollect is shadows . They filled in the hollows in his cheeks and under his eyes . They set off his slightly beaky nose and chin and thinned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the shape of his skull . That and his beautiful hands and the careful still way he seemed to hold himself almost put me in mind of a statue , the likeness of somebody lived long ago , done something now forgotten that seemed important at the time . He took my vanity case , heavy with home-cooked food , from my hands and set it down . He started to shake my hand , then halfway changed his mind and give me something meant to be a hug but never quite turned out as such . Wim is tall and I am not . I wound up with my head sort of caught in his armpit . " I 'm William , " he said . " Obviously . " " Pleased , " I said , trying to sound as certain , as unsurprised , as he was . But him being so old was the last thing in this world I expected . Pammy Jo was ten years older than me , and Wim ( which is what she called him , so after a while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlucky . Plus it made them having a baby kind of an embarrassment , I thought . " How 'd you know me so quick ? " I asked , like I was changing the subject . He looked me up and down , but not in a rude kind of way . I was wearing last year 's Easter dress , a pale-yellow cotton with a drop waist and little cap sleeves . My shoes and bag were white patent leather . Mama 's good gray poplin raincoat that she outgrew was draped over my arm . My brother-in-law looked like he was trying too hard not to smile , which got my goat . I figured my nerves was still frayed from landing a foot from the water . " Is something the matter with me ? " I said . Wim laughed and did n't look the least bit sorry . " Well ? " I said . " It 's twenty-nine degrees , " he said . " Something just told me you 'd have to be from the Tarheel State . " " Twenty-nine ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here how to put on a proper springtime ? " Wim laughed again , right loud this time . " You may be the sunshine we 've been waiting for , " he said . He did n't look near as old as I first thought . I was still kind of disappointed , though , that he had n't studied my picture . Mama 'd sent Pammy a new one every year . I did n't much care for the way Pammy 's husband said " the Tarheel State , " either . It was like you 'd talk about a place you 'd never been and already made up your mind it was n't worth the trip ... kind of how I felt about Massachusetts before my sister that I had n't seen in a dozen years called up out of the blue to a neighbor 's house and when I called her back all tongue-tied and my heart thumping said in a voice just barely familiar how she needed me to help her , she was having a baby and she needed me .... Or like Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade and Pammy Jo said she was going up north to Boston and go to school and it was n't going to cost a penny because of a scholarship . And Mama said , " Massachusetts ? If you 're of a mind to go there , girl , you 'd best not get a hankering to come back .... " Oh , she could be like that , Mama , hard , you know , for years after Daddy got killed . He was working for the state , which seemed like all the safety a man could need -- steady work plus overtime and health assurance and a pension waiting down the road . That bonus for working away from home come as pure blessing , Mama said . " Be gone but six weeks , they promised , and there were such things as we wanted for you girls , wanted so bad .... " But then they got to blasting out there in the western part of the state , cutting a new highway through the mountains .... Well , it seemed like those boulders just crushed Mama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama was only a mite when her own mama , not yet thirty years old , passed on . The baby she died having , Mama 's little sister , Lacey , did n't last a month . Then it was only Mama and her daddy , him traveling hither and yon for farmwork , never so much as a full season in the same place nor a house to call their own . " No life for a child , " was mostly all Mama 'd say about it . But you could see the past was a dark place she never quite quit living in , especially once Daddy was n't there to coax her out into the here and now . Mama came around to mellowing a good bit , though , seeming to soften as she grew stout . You ask me , it was a downright shame Pammy Jo never got to know that lady , never found her way to the tender heart cushioned in that big soft body . They really might have done one another some good over time . Mama , plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a child so amply given to make-believe . Pammy Jo 's imagination , huge and bold and brassy , seemed made on a different scale than what most of us get born with . I was , as a child , only too happy to let my sister make up my life for me . With our daddy taken from us -- and Mama , too , gone in her way , gone all dark and distant -- Pammy made it her business to provide for us . Over time her longings endowed us with whole generations of kinfolk . We acquired rich uncles in Baltimore , Maine , and Saudi Arabia , frail cousins with fatal diseases , maiden aunts with museums for namesakes . The various grandfathers Pammy dreamed up were inclined to be judges with Old Testament names -- Micah and Samuel and Obadiah . We mostly called them Pawpaw . Not a one of them failed to dote on us , of course . Pammy 's specialty was grandmothers , though . She saw to it that we had at least a dozen . All those righteous judges that were so fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice 's sake . Because our grannies were always widows , stern old ladies who made up in feisty independence what they lacked in means . You 'd think it might occur to a judge to make better provision for his family , but that did n't seem to concern Pammy . My sister was always rushing us into the shriveled arms of grim necessity . Our grandmothers , every one of them , had a flair for hardship and a wealth of hidden talents . No matter how weighty the fibs my sister hung on her family tree 's flimsy branches , I never took issue . Fact is , I loved her tales , found comfort in dreams of a world crawling with beloved strangers just waiting for us to track them down so they could claim us . If Pammy 's habit troubled me at all , it was only from fear my own puny imagination might let her down , betray her . But such dazzling stories are apt to daze folks dumb . I was hardly ever asked to confirm them . I was too young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagas for the sad and desperate thing they amounted to . It 's only lately , in fact , Mama and Pammy now so long gone their faces go a little transparent when I conjure them , that I see the dire need behind an imagination I admired , even coveted , for its boundlessness . My sister 's imagination must have known bounds . How else could Mama have fallen so far beyond them , her thrifty but durable love something Pammy just could n't see ? Which maybe explains why she could n't stop looking , stop hoping somehow to find all she needed in what she 'd simply made up .  - -  Pammy and Wim lived , thank goodness , in a small town a good distance north and west of Boston . From the glimpse I got of the city , all grime and hubbub , I wanted no part of it . The way home was n't much more than seventy miles , Wim said . Maybe a tenth of such distance as I 'd already come ? But what with all the ice on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as my plane ride , to get there . Wim did n't have much to say for himself along the way . The little conversation he made a stab at sounded like he was n't half listening to himself . He gripped the steering wheel of his shabby gray sedan in a way that turned his tan knuckles white as the bone beneath . I told myself all my questions would be answered soon enough by Pammy Jo anyhow . Still , he might have softened the silence some by maybe playing the radio . I could see anyhow that the driving called for every bit of his attention . All along the highway , cars were stopped crooked , any which way , some in ditches , even . We saw one car bellied up on the median like a big blue bug . I was sure that ride would never come to an end . Finally , though , we skidded through the crossroads of a little town with a tall skinny white church and a general store and a row of shops painted barn red . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first got up there . Scenic New England . The ice was so thick on the shop windows I could n't get much idea what might be inside . Then we were out in the country again , and the road , wandering through woods and scrappy pasturage hemmed in by low stone walls a cow could have stepped over , was slippery as bacon grease . " We 're nearly there . " Wim sounded like he 'd only then recollected I was along for the ride . " Praise the Lord ! " I sort of blurted out , because by then I had to go to the bathroom so bad . Wim laughed again , which made me huffy . " What is it about me tickles you so , " I said , " you do n't mind my asking ? " He seemed to dwell on it for a moment . " You 're a good deal like your sister , " he said . " When I first met her . You sound like she did then . " His smile looked sad or ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't keep miffed anyhow , not with him looking that way . He had to been worried about Pammy and the baby . " She sounds different now ? " Wim shrugged , keeping his eyes on the road . " How did y'all meet ? " I asked him . " She did n't tell you ? " He was trying not to sound surprised . " Never did tell us much , Pammy . " " I was her teacher , " Wim said . " Teacher , " I said . " At the college ? " He nodded , his eyes skating over the slick twist of road . Well , no wonder Pammy did n't mention it . Her teacher ? Mama would n't have cared much for that . " I never met anyone like her . " Wim sounded like an old man suddenly , all caught up in the past like it was a dream . " She was just so ... fresh , " he said . I figured he meant she talked back , acted up some in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I had trouble imagining . " Perpetually asking questions , " Wim said . " She seemed to have an uncanny facility for finding that one thing I could n't quite explain . I 'd try , though . Then she 'd give me this look ... " Wim 's worn leather glove scrabbled at the frost formed inside of the windshield like his memories were freezing there and he needed to clear them away so as not to be blinded to the dangerous road ahead . " Pammy always did have a mind of her own , " I said . I do n't think he heard me . " There is something fearsome about that kind of intelligence , " he said . I felt like I knew just what he meant . But why had he married my sister , then , a man like him ? It 's a question I still , after all these years , got only guesses for , no answers .... Why ?  - -  Leandra : My name lollygags on his tongue like something he ca n't get enough of . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ask me , it 's more like the flavor he relishes , something he can hold in his mouth and make it last and last . He as good as admitted it once , though he tried to make it sound like a joke . " Leandra , " Wim said , " you are an acquired taste . " This woman he 's married to now is called Clio , which I always thought was a name for a dog because of this old TV program Mama used to like ... before my time , she said . Only then it came on in reruns . Wim , I reckon , is before my time too . Wim 's wife weaves wool .... Could be one of them tongue twisters children love , saying the words over and over until the sense of them gets lost . Wim 's wife weaves ... I picture a big loom in the corner of their cold glass parlor , right where Pammy 's piano used to set . The shawls and mufflers and throws Clio makes are dark and smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year at Christmastime , a shawl , a table mat , a rough afghan once . I keep them in the cedar chest , where they 'll be safe from the chewing moths . I wonder if Clio picks out these gifts , choosing such things as came out somehow on the disappointing side . Or maybe Wim filches them , leaving his wife to wonder where this or that prickly sprawl of wool has disappeared to . That would be like Wim , I think . He told me once , no bones about it , that his hero when he was a boy was Robin Hood ... Robin Hood , who if you ask me was no better than a common thief , never mind what he done with what he took . Wim stands now in the center of the single room that is my house and lets me see full how the thick middle of him sags , and he do n't pretend his hands are at anything but a loss . When he passed close to me , coming through the door , Wim smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steal from me , finding rightness in his greater need . Mama 's silver iced tea spoons dangle in a swan-shaped wooden rack above the sink , right in plain view . But it wo n't be those . Wim ai n't after anything so simple as sterling . I 'd wager he hardly knows himself what it is he covets . He lifts up his head and looks close at me for the first time since I let him in the house . I stare right back at him . The light in the room is not good . Dim rooms are restful of an evening , I think . I 'll cozy up to one small lamp and let the rest of the room stay pitchy . " I should n't have come , " Wim says . " I know that . " His voice shows no remorse , nor his eyes . " Why did you , then ? " I say . " After all this time . " He keeps his eyes trained steady on mine . " Nobody has ever looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need some looking into , Leandra . " I turn away quick . " You 'd best quit talking nonsense . " Behind me , Wim laughs . He sounds like a sad old man , seasoned to his own foolishness until he scarcely minds it anymore . " What do you mean to find here , Wim ? " " What might be left of me , " he says . I may not understand him , but he is n't lying . I know that much .  - -  Pammy Jo and Wim lived , like I said , way out in the country . But their house was a kind nobody but city folks could abide . The high glass walls looked barely held up by the clumps of stone and slashes of raw wood that joined them . Indoors the rafters were left stark naked , like in a barn , and the round stone fireplace belonged in some patchy campground if you asked me . There was n't even a fire . " Pamela ? " Wim 's voice had thinned out , seemed like . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house was cold and silent . It smelled of fresh lumber and nothing else , like nobody had ever cooked or eaten there . " She sleeps quite a bit . " Wim was nearly whispering . " Reckon that 's the best thing . " I whispered too . A murky narrow passageway cut off to the right of the fireplace . Wim started that way , then turned around and beckoned me follow . " She 'll want to see you , " he said . I wished he had sounded surer . At the end of the passage , the icy afternoon light spilled in from outdoors again . The room Wim went into , and me after , was mostly glass . There was even a large patch of it up in the ceiling , though thick ice blocked off the sky . The room was big and square . About the same size as the room that is my house . There was hardly any furniture , which made it seem even bigger . The one wall that was n't glass , white as meringue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , blond wood , looked brittle with varnish . In the center of the room sat the biggest bed I ever saw , and in the center of the bed , under a heap of mayonnaise-colored comforter , was my sister . " Sweetheart ? " Wim said . Pammy opened eyes that were dark , nearly navy blue , with lashes so long folks tended to doubt they were real . Eyes that big and dark in a face so white , so thin , looked almost freakish . Her hair , once unconscionably long and fiery , was cut to her shoulders and had gone a little dim . My sister was still beautiful , though . Never could Pammy not be beautiful , nor could I ever not know her . I whispered her name . I thought I did . I whispered my sister 's name like a secret I 'd been sworn to keep until I died and now I was ... Pammy . I felt my own life pulling away from me . But it was no more than a breath I let loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband looked at me and the air in the room stayed stretched tight . " Where have you been ? " My sister , staring at her husband , sounded fretful . Her lips looked parched and pale . " The roads are a disaster . " Wim seemed to shrink a little . I expected him to go on , telling about the cars in ditches and how we kept having to stop and chip ice off the windshield when the wipers got too crusted to move . But it was as if Wim knew how little use there 'd be in explanation . He spoke like a man expecting not to be heard . " The trip was slow , " he said . " Are you all right ? " I kept waiting for my sister to look at me . The foolish thought popped into my head that she looked like the princess whose sleep got spoiled by a pea slipped under her mattress . " I have n't had a thing to eat all day . " " Pamela --  " Wim reached one hand toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was embarrassed . I stepped up to the bedside , smiling . " You feel like some Carolina corn bread , girl ? " I said . " Brought some okra too . Fig preserve and a pecan pie . " My sister shut her eyes for a minute . When she opened them again , she had put on a pleasant look as false and spare as the greenery filling in the gaps on a plate in a restaurant trying to be fancy . " Leandra , " she said . " All grown up . " " Close to it anyhow , " I allowed . I leaned down to kiss her , nearly toppling onto the bed because she lay so far from its edge . When I caught my balance by touching her shoulder , she shuddered . " Good Lord , your hands are like ice . " Her voice did n't sound the least bit familiar . She sounds right like her husband , I thought . Then I wondered if it was on purpose , each letter being so distinct , and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rubbed my hands along the sides of my dress , but the cotton seemed even colder than I was . " I 'm a little flummoxed , " I said . " Seeing you and riding an airplane and becoming an aunt and all . " Pammy looked away . " You had a good trip ? " " Tolerable . " I rolled my eyes , made a face , hoping my sister would laugh , or at least Wim would . But their eyes were fastened on each other . " Let me fix you a plate , " I said . " I 'm past being hungry , " said Pammy . " You should eat something , Pamela , " Wim said . " I know . " She sighed . " Did you really drag all that up here , Leandra ? Figs and ... " She trailed off as if the very notion wore her out . " I did , " I said . " Even sweet potato biscuits . That 's one thing I 'd never forget , how you could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You must have been a sight at the airport . Shopping bags , I suppose ? " " Honey , " Wim said . " I used the vanity case from Mama 's Samsonite , " I said . " I got so many things I been saving up to tell you , Pammy Jo ! " But my sister was looking at her husband again , like I was already gone and she had only him to blame . " I 'd best go make acquaintance with the kitchen first , " I said . When I glanced back from the broody passageway , Pammy was rolling over , showing Wim her back . He just stood there , looking helpless , as the huge bed bucked and swayed under my sister like a monstrous animal trying to lumber to its feet . Later that evening , when Pammy was asleep again and Wim and I were eating warmed-over stew beef in the chilly white kitchen , I asked him about that bed . He told me it was a special kind . The mattress was filled with warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I kept picturing Pammy 's dinner plate , coming back to the kitchen as full as when I carried it in to her . One of the biscuits , garish inside as orange sherbet , had been torn in two . Like my sister had thought to trick me into believing a bite had been taken from it .  - -  The ice melted away in a day or two , but all that April and on into May the weather stayed raw and rainy . It seemed like maybe I would n't have been so homesick if I could just have got warm . My thin clothes never stopped reminding me how little I belonged in that place . Reckon I might have borrowed some things from Pammy , but I could n't hardly bring myself to ask , her being so peevish . She 'd never cared for me touching her things when I was a youngster . I found this old zippered sweatshirt of Wim 's anyhow . It lingered on a hook by the back door like a limp gray shadow . In the mornings after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled a little musty , like a cellar , but also like him somehow . I was always careful to take it off and hang it back up before he came home . One day Wim got back early , though , and saw me in it . He did n't say anything , and I did n't , either . The next evening he brought me a red fleece jacket with the name of his school , St. George 's , and a big dragon on the back . " Now you 'll have a souvenir , " he said with a twisted little smile . The dragon was breathing fire . I looked for things I could do to brighten that house , but Pammy Jo would n't stand for much . She did n't care for what I cooked . Would only eat powdered mushroom soup that came in an envelope , frozen creamed spinach that came in a box , this special bread Wim brought from a bakery in town . The bread -- wheat germ , he said -- was rough as silage . Pammy Jo liked it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I crumbled the wasted crusts and scattered them out back along the path by the kitchen door , hoping the birds would come find them . It always surprised me how few birds they seemed to have around there . You 'd hardly know it was spring . When the wind was high , the frail-spined house would whine and moan until my hair about stood on end . The sound came , Wim said , from how the place was built . There had to be some give in the glass , was how he explained it . To me , though , that house was just begging for some heat and light like a body naturally would in such weather . I 'd thought , that first night , to make a fire . But the handsome brass-edged woodbox on the hearth was empty . Pammy did n't want soot spoiling the furniture and such , Wim said . Well , keeping the house spick-and-span , that was surely something I could manage . The third day I was there , Wim off at school and Pammy sleeping most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good scouring , putting plenty of ammonia in the water . I took every last thing out of the cupboards and scrubbed the shelves down too . My eyes were still teared up from the ammonia when Wim got home at five . You could see he was surprised at how I 'd pitched in , and he about fell all over himself thanking me . " Ai n't that what I 'm here for , " I said , " to try and help out ? Once she 's got that little one , do n't reckon Pammy will have much time for cleaning . " Wim looked distressed . " Is something wrong ? " " No , no , " he said . " Leandra , can we sit down ? " He slumped out of his heavy coat and hooked it over the back of a chair . A faded red book bag sat on the table , a battered thermos bottle poking up out of it . " Sit down , " he said again . He pulled out a chair for me , then sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not that we do n't appreciate what you 're doing , Leandra , " he said . " But we have a woman on Fridays ... " " A woman ? " I said . " Who comes to clean ? Josie 's been with us for years , " Wim said . I wanted to rub my stinging eyes , but I was afraid he 'd think I was crying . Wim looked down at the table , empty and shining in front of him . " Pamela can be ... very particular , " he said . " About the house . And Josie ... well , she has her own way of doing things . " He sighed . " Sometimes we have to put up with ... We 'd be lost without her , I 'm afraid . " I nodded once , then looked away . I was thinking about my mama , always cleaning up after folks who were no kin to her . Why , your mama 's just a regular part of our family , one of them rich ladies told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not -- look at my brother-in-law . Wim reached across the table , took hold of my chin , and turned my face toward him like he owned it . I wrenched it away . He looked straight into my eyes then , and I could see him seeing how he 'd hurt me , seeing it and feeling it and taking it into himself . It was easy , for a moment , to hate him . " What is it exactly I am here for , William ? " I said . He hesitated . " I 'm not sure , " he said . " I thought it was to help out . " " You 're not here to be a servant , Leandra . " " No , indeed , " I said . " I 'm here to be a sister . Only I guess it needs some explaining , what a sister is allowed to take on herself . Reckon I 'm out of practice . " He flinched like I 'd slapped him . " Forgive me , " he said . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look away , keep aloof , but I ca n't seem to hold a grudge if you clamp it in a vise for me . " Me neither , " I told him . " Not well at all . " Wim sagged back in his chair , then we smiled a pair of woefully dim smiles . " I thought if Pamela just were n't alone so much ... " " You thought . " Wim lowered his eyes . " We ... " He shrugged . " My being here was your idea , then , " I said . He did n't answer me . " Pammy does n't care for it one bit , " I said . " Does she ? " " I do n't think Pamela knows what she wants , " Wim said . " Except not to be pregnant anymore . " I nodded . " To have the baby safe and sound . Of course that 's what she wants . " I do n't think I 'd realized until that moment , when I saw it drop away , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . What I read in his newly naked look was that , old as he seemed to me then , a professor and all , Wim did n't have no more idea than a boy would how to comfort a wife . How to ease a child 's passage into this cold world . And I got an inkling too , maybe , that we all , Wim and Pammy and me and even that little creature whose foothold on this life seemed such a slippery thing , that all of us were already twisted up in some sorry predicament we could n't stop or grasp or even see . " Leandra , I 'd be so grateful if you could just --  " Wim took off his glasses and rubbed his big square thumbs across the ridge of bone that held up his heavy eyebrows . " Tell me , " I said . " I wo n't know what I 'm even doing here unless I can help . " Wim has a heavy beard , and dark , even now when his hair 's gone half white . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thick , close-cropped hair then . His cheeks and chin were dug out deep , though , and above his lip looked smudged late in the day . " If you could get her to come back , " he said . " She is so far away . " " I reckon she must be scared . Do n't you think ? " My voice came out small and unsure . " Those babies our mama lost back when --  " I saw Wim wince . " Now I 'm making you scared too , " I said . Wim , staring at his hands , seemed like he could n't hear me . " Pammy must have told you ... about Mama losing some babies ? " He slowly shook his head . " Three , I think . Or it may have been four . " Again Wim sighed , and suddenly I wanted to tell him all I never told to anyone , how all those many years later the pain of those tiny failed lives lived on in the eyes of a woman with two grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't she did n't love us , I imagined telling my sister 's husband , just how her love came to us worn , a little skimpy , like something handed down once too often . But my throat and lips and tongue could not surrender so much , of course , not to a man I scarcely yet knew . Still , my sorrow must have whispered something of itself to Wim , because he reached across the table then and touched for just a second the back of my hand . " Mama was still talking about those lost babies two days before she died , " I said . " Past the time when she even remembered me . " Tubes of icy bluish light slashed the ceiling of the square white kitchen . " I felt so ... puny . " The sound I made then , trying to laugh , was an embarrassment . Wim just nodded , though . " Like you were n't even there , " he said . And when I looked into his eyes it seemed to be me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting him to spy himself in me . But when I turned back , a small smile kinked his face , saying , Too late , too late to keep anything from me . When finally I spoke again I sounded groggy , like somebody just shaken awake . " It all happened before I was born , those little lost babies and how after ... I reckon it 's what Pammy Jo 's recollecting anyhow , maybe still seeing it like a small child would , how the darkness just swooped down and like to swallowed up her mama . " " Is that what she says ? " Wim 's voice was thin . " She do n't say much , " I admitted . " You got to remember it 's only a nine-year-old keeps me from being a stranger . " He looked at me like I was making no sense . " Me . " I smiled . " I was nine when she left . Just a child . I got no idea how much memory Pammy 's kept of that child , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into ? My sister do n't know her one bit better than you do . " A pot of potatoes I 'd set to boil on the range dripped onto the burner and hissed . I went to turn down the heat , keeping my back to Wim . " Did she ever talk about me ? Used to , I mean ? " He made no attempt to answer . I understood then how honest Wim could be when it was hard , and maybe started right there to love him a little . " Never mind , " I said . " Reckon it 's us being sisters now that matters . " I turned around and looked at him . " You just keep mindful of the sturdy baby my mama finally got around to having , though , because that one grew into somebody can put her foot down when darkness tries to take over a house . " It took him a moment to get my meaning . Then he tipped back his head , smiling only with his eyes . I saw Wim 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The glazed black windows were starting to cloud with steam . I wondered how causing his laughter could even for a moment have brought me a thing but gladness . " Wim ... You mind me calling you that ? " " I 'm told William does n't suit me , " he said . I considered that . " Do n't reckon it does . " His eyes , even then , were a hazy shade , almost like doubt would be if you picked a color for it . I looked deep into them for a second . " Do n't fret , " I said . " I expect the child will bring her back to us if we ca n't do it ourselves . " I only half believed , of course , what I was promising . My honesty lacked the clear sharp edges of Wim 's . But I tried not to think about that . Sometimes the lie you got to believe yourself is all you got to offer a soul in need . Later you might have to decide were you being generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHAPTER ONE CONTINUES ...
