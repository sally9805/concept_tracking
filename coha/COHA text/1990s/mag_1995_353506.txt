How potent is Iran 's variety of militant political Islam ? To Bill Clinton and Warren Christopher , it is one of the most dangerous forces on earth . But listen to what an Iranian housewife named Hafezeh has to say . Earlier this month , just before the sixth anniversary of the death of Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini , she sat on a carpet inside his gold-domed mausoleum . Under her loosely draped chador she wore blue jeans and a bright turquoise blouse . <P> " I was 16 when I joined the Revolutionary Guards in 1979 , " she said . " I used to go out in the patrol car with the sisters female Revolutionary Guards . They were looking for women who were n't wearing proper Islamic covering . They threw acid in their faces or said , ' Let me take off your lipstick , ' and cut their lips with a razor hidden in a Kleenex . " She also recalls the early lure of plunder . " The government offered my husband and me a villa in north Tehran . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' No , we ca n't take it . ' But there were many other Revolutionary Guards who drank alcohol and took people 's houses . It sickened us , and we both quit . Now my husband is a truck driver . He drives to Germany . When he comes home I have a bottle of whisky waiting , and we drink it together . I dress like the loose women in Europe for him . I do n't think God minds . " <P> In Iran today , many men and women like Hafezeh maintain their faith in Islam but have distanced themselves from the revolution and its strict way of life . Pervasive corruption and a troubled economy have deepened disillusionment , and in recent months serious riots have broken out in several cities . Meanwhile , the U.S. and Israel regard Iran as a rogue state that seeks to export terror , build nuclear weapons and sabotage the Middle East peace process . When the Clinton Administration recently imposed a complete economic embargo , the rhetoric was harsher than that against any other country . But however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not widely understood : the revolution is decaying . Iran is already severely undermining itself . <P> The schism between a diminishing core of loyal revolutionaries and the rest of Iranian society is growing . The divide is religious , political and especially cultural . " When I came back from the war with Iraq , I was disgusted , " says a Revolutionary Guard commander . " I saw my friends martyred , and here all the young people wanted was to be like Madonna and Michael Jackson . " By their way of dress , Iranians signal where they stand in the cultural divide . Devout revolutionaries wear dark colors . Men favor baggy trousers , long-sleeved shirts buttoned to the neck and several days ' growth of beard ; women wear layers of Islamic clothing known as hijab , including the magneh ( a headdress ) and the chador . On the other side , the garbzadeh  --  literally , " those poisoned by the West "  --  wear jeans and colored short-sleeved shirts if they are men ; the women wear a raincoat-like " uniform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
