Ron Helmer 's two-car garage is n't much to look at , but the modest structure set amid the cornfields and ranch homes of exurban Freeland , Michigan , harbors a revolution . Inside the garage and spilling over into what was Helmer 's living room is the Northlane Math and Science Academy , a new kind of public school . In these unconventional quarters , Helmer , a veteran teacher and school administrator , and two other teachers are attempting to guide 39 students , ages 6 to 12 , toward a better understanding of their world via a very active brand of learning . <P> On a recent day , the youngest children gathered around the small pond in Helmer 's backyard , collecting water samples and aquatic plants for study . In the former living room , an older group struggled with the intricacies of urban planning  --  where to put the power plants , whether to build a highway , how big to make the municipal hospital  --  by playing a complex computer game called SimCity 2000 on the school 's five new Macintoshes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garage , sanding and sawing to create kid-size furniture of their own design . <P> Like other Michigan public schools , Northlane Academy gets its funding  --  a total of $175,500  --  from the state lottery and sales taxes . But because the school belongs to a new category of independent " charter schools "  --  one of nine that have opened in Michigan this fall  --  Helmer , as principal , is free to spend the money as he sees fit  --  on those Macs , for example  --  without interference or oversight from the local board of education . He is also free to depart from the public-school curriculum , which he regards as about a mile long and an inch deep . Northlane , he vows , will teach kids to think and understand rather than learning by rote . " Here we 're not so concerned with being able to name the three capitals of South Africa as we are with why South Africa has three capitals ; with understanding the cultural , economic and political forces that created those capitals . " <P> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with Northlane 's young scholars . Sidney Tessin , 10 , excitedly tells how her class dissected walnuts and discussed the ways vascular and nonvascular plants differ . In her old public school " we talked about plants , " she says , " but never about why there are vascular and nonvascular plants . " Nick Reisinger , a freckled 12- year-old , chimes in : " Here we get to talk about things instead of just listening to some boring teacher . I do n't feel like ' Duh , what am I doing here ? ' anymore . " <P> THE CHARTER-SCHOOL MOVEMENT IS NOT yet big . Just 11 states , beginning with Minnesota in 1991 , have passed laws permitting the creation of autonomous public schools like Northlane ; a dozen more have similar laws in the works . Most states have restricted the number of these schools ( 100 in California , 25 in Massachusetts ) in an attempt to appease teachers ' unions and other opponents . Nevertheless , the charter movement is being heralded as the latest and best hope for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and can not compete internationally .
