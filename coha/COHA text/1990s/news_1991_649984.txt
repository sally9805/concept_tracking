##@x <p> " Surprising best sellers often provide publishing 's sweetest stories , " began a story that appeared in USA Today on Tuesday about the nonfiction paperback hit of the summer , " The Education of Little Tree . " <p> First published in 1976 by Delacorte Press and reprinted in 1986 by the University of New Mexico Press , the late Forrest Carter 's gentle memoir of his Native American childhood has remained in first or second place on The New York Times paperback best-seller list for 14 weeks . <p> Adolescent and adult readers have warmed to the uplifting story of how this well-known writer of westerns  --  author of " The Rebel Outlaw : Josey Wales " and " Cry Geronimo " and friend of Clint Eastwood  --  came to know the wisdom of his Cherokee ancestors . In the wake of the success of " Dances With Wolves , " there is even talk of a Hollywood film . <p> Unfortunately , " The Education of Little Tree " is a hoax . The carefully constructed mask of Forrest Carter  --  Cherokee cowboy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last fantasy of a man who reinvented himself again and again in the 30 years that preceded his death in 1979 . <p> His real name was Asa ( Ace ) Earl Carter . We share a common Southern heritage and he may be a distant relation of mine . Between 1946 and 1973 , the Alabama native carved out a violent career in Southern politics as a Ku Klux Klan terrorist , right-wing radio announcer , home-grown American fascist and anti-Semite , rabble-rousing demagogue and secret author of the famous 1963 speech by Gov . George Wallace of Alabama : " Segregation now . . . Segregation tomorrow . . . Segregation forever . " <p> He even organized a paramilitary unit of about 100 men that he called the Original Ku Klux Klan of the Confederacy . Among its acts , these white-sheeted sociopaths assaulted Nat ( King ) Cole during a concert in Birmingham in 1956 . In 1957 , the group , without Mr. Carter present , castrated a black man they chose at random in a Birmingham suburb as a warning to " uppity " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Carter as a self-taught writer . Indeed he was . For almost 30 years he honed his skills by spewing out racist and anti-Semitic pamphlets . In 1970 he wrote that all N.A.A.C.P. presidents " have been Jews . . . the same gang who financed the Russian Communist Revolution with millions out of New York City . " <p> The same year , in a disquisition on the prospect of black policemen , he wrote : " SOON , you can expect your wife or daughter to be pulled over to the side of the road by one of these Ubangi or Watusi tribesman wearing the badge of Anglo-Saxon law enforcement and toting a gun . . . but he will be as uncivilized as the day his kind were found eating their kin in the jungle . " <p> Those who knew the gun-toting Ace Carter never found him very amusing , certainly not the two fellow Klansmen who were critically wounded by Mr. Carter in a 1957 shootout over Klan finances . Though Mr. Carter was indicted for assault with intent to murder , the Jefferson County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Alabama , ultimately decided to drop the charges . <p> But anyone who transformed himself into a new-age wise man for the greening of America while taking the name of " Forrest " Carter could n't have been entirely humorless . Mr. Carter , after all , took his new name from Nathan Bedford Forrest , the tobacco-chewing ex-mule skinner , slave trader and Civil War general who founded the original Ku Klux Klan in Tennessee in 1866 . <p> Can this be the same man who wrote " The Education of Little Tree " with its saccharine environmentalism and patronizing descriptions of imaginary Cherokee grandparents ? ( " They gave themselves . . . to nature , not trying to subdue it , or pervert it , but to live with it . And so they loved the thought , and loving it grew to be it , so that they could not think as the white man . " ) <p> One explanation is suggested by the Calhoun County High School yearbook for 1943 . The senior class prophet predicted he would return to Calhoun County as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abilene , Tex. , of heart failure at the age of 53 , he was on his way to California with a screenplay for his second Josey Wales book . Handsome , energetic , ambitious , always the actor , his classmates had known that Asa Carter would do whatever he had to to escape the sleepy little Alabama town of Oxford . <p> In his lifetime , Forrest Carter was able to move from Klan rabble-rouser to speech writer for George Wallace 's white backlash to successful author and screenwriter by finding a voice in harmony with a changing America . <p> In Asa Carter 's first book , the rebel outlaw Josey Wales seeks common ground with the Commanche chief , Ten Bears , in a soliloquy that Clint Eastwood repeats in his film . " What ye and me cares about has been butchered . . . raped , " Wales tells Ten Bears . " It 's been done by them lyin ' , double-tongued snakes that run guv-mints . Guv-mints lie . . . promise . . . back-stab . . . eat in youre lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their promises . " <p> Even the gentle Little Tree , Mr. Carter 's newly popular hero , learned to despise all representatives of organized society  --  teachers , politicians , religious leaders  --  as " powerful monsters who had no regard for how folks had to live and get by . " <p> From Tom Mix to Gary Cooper , the task of the traditional western hero was to replace the savage world of the desperado with the civilized community governed by the rule of law . Americans might feel a loss at the end of the frontier , but the word " outlaw " was seldom a compliment . <p> All that changed in the 1960 's . American moviegoers flocked to see Clint Eastwood in " A Fistful of Dollars , " his grimy spaghetti western , and by the 1980 's , Rambo was king of the box office . Asa Carter 's celebration of sadomasochistic violence and thinly veiled vigilantism in his westerns of the 1960 's and 70 's had become a powerful theme of American popular culture . <p> In the last three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education of Little Tree " and " Cry Geronimo , " Mr. Carter changed course . But there are threads that stretch from Asa Carter 's racist pamphlets to his new-age novels of the Native American : We live unto ourselves . We trust no one outside the circle of blood kin and closest comrades . We have no responsibilities outside that closed circle . Government and all its agencies are corrupt . Politics is a lie . <p> What does it tell us that we are so easily deceived ? @@649984 , what , forty-plus years later ? He 'd stopped counting the years as they slipped into memory . After all , he 'd spent a lifetime between these bookended visits . A marriage . The birth of an ungrateful son . Cancer , and a burial . He missed his wife , Ethel . She 'd been gone six months now . But he did n't miss her as much as you 'd think , as bad as that might sound . It was more like quiet relief really . Her health had been bad  --  no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been downright crippling , to both of us , he thought . <br> For the last seven years Henry had fed her , bathed her , helped her to the bathroom when she needed to go , and back again when she was all through . He took care of her night and day , 24/7 as they say these days . Marty , his son , thought his mother should have been put in a home , but Henry would have none of it . " Not in my lifetime , " Henry said , resisting . Not just because he was Chinese ( though that was a part of his resistance ) . The Confucian ideal of filial piety  --  respect and reverence for one 's parents  --  was a cultural relic not easily discarded by Henry 's generation . He 'd been raised to care for loved ones , personally , and to put someone in a home was unacceptable . What his son , Marty , never fully understood was that deep down there was an Ethel-shaped hole in Henry 's life , and without her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sharp , the years slipping away like blood from a wound that never heals . <br> Now she was gone for good . She needed to be buried , Henry thought , the traditional Chinese way , with food offerings , longevity blankets , and prayer ceremonies lasting several days  --  despite Marty 's fit about cremating her . He was so modern . He 'd been seeing a counselor and dealing with his mother 's death through an online support group , whatever that was . Going online sounded like talking to no one , which Henry had some firsthand experience in  --  in real life . It was lonely . Almost as lonely as Lake View Cemetery , where he 'd buried Ethel . She now had a gorgeous view of Lake Washington , and was interred with Seattle 's other Chinese notables , like Bruce Lee and his own son , Brandon . But in the end , each of them occupied a solitary grave . Alone forever . It did n't matter who your neighbors were . They did n't talk back . <br> When night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , asking her how her day was . She never replied , of course . " I 'm not crazy or anything , " Henry would say to no one , " just open-minded . You never know who 's listening . " Then he 'd busy himself pruning his Chinese palm or evergreen  --  houseplants whose brown leaves confessed his months of neglect . But now he had time once again . Time to care for something that would grow stronger for a change . <br> Occasionally , though , he 'd wonder about statistics . Not the cancer mortality rates that had caught up with dear Ethel . Instead he thought about himself , and his time measured on some life insurance actuarial table . He was only fifty-six  --  a young man by his own standards . But he 'd read in Newsweek about the inevitable decline in the health of a surviving spouse his age . Maybe the clock was ticking ? He was n't sure , because as soon as Ethel passed , time began to crawl , clock or no clock . <br> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now had all the time in the world , and no one to share the hours with . No one with whom to walk down to the Mon Hei bakery for yuet beng , carrot mooncakes , on cool autumn evenings . <br> Instead here he was , alone in a crowd of strangers . A man between lifetimes , standing at the foot of the Panama Hotel once again . Following the cracked steps of white marble that made the hotel look more like an Art Deco halfway house . The establishment , like Henry , seemed caught between worlds . Still , Henry felt nervous and excited , just like he had been as a boy , whenever he walked by . He 'd heard a rumor in the marketplace and wandered over from the video store on South Jackson . At first he thought there was some kind of accident because of the growing size of the crowd . But he did n't hear or see anything , no sirens wailing , no flashing lights . Just people drifting toward the hotel , like the tide going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one step at a time . <br> As Henry walked over , he saw a news crew arrive and followed them inside . The crowd parted as camera-shy onlookers politely stepped away , clearing a path . Henry followed right behind , shuffling his feet so as not to step on anyone , or in turn be stepped upon , feeling the crowd press back in behind him . At the top of the steps , just inside the lobby , the hotel 's new owner announced , " We 've found something in the basement . " <br> Found what ? A body perhaps ? Or a drug lab of some kind ? No , there 'd be police officers taping off the area if the hotel were a crime scene . <br> Before the new owner , the hotel had been boarded up since 1950 , and in those years , Chinatown had become a ghetto gateway for tongs  --  gangs from Hong Kong and Macau . The city blocks south of King Street had a charming trashiness by day ; the litter and slug trails on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture from another era . Children on field trips , wrapped in colorful coats and hats , held hands as they followed their noses to the mouthwatering sight of barbecue duck in the windows , hanging red crayons melting in the sun . But at night , drug dealers and bony , middle-aged hookers working for dime bags haunted the streets and alleys . The thought of this icon of his childhood becoming a makeshift crack house made him ache with a melancholy he had n't felt since he held Ethel 's hand and watched her exhale , long and slow , for the last time . <br> Precious things just seemed to go away , never to be had again . <br> As he took off his hat and began fanning himself with the threadbare brim , the crowd pushed forward , pressing in from the rear . Flashbulbs went off . Standing on his tippy toes , he peered over the shoulder of the tall news reporter in front of him . <br> The new hotel owner , a slender Caucasian woman , slightly younger than Henry , walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She popped it open , and Henry 's heart beat a little faster as he saw it for what it was . A Japanese parasol , made from bamboo , bright red and white  --  with orange koi painted on it , carp that looked like giant goldfish . It shed a film of dust that floated , suspended momentarily in the air as the hotel owner twirled the fragile-looking artifact for the cameras . Two more men brought up a steamer trunk bearing the stickers of foreign ports : Admiral Oriental Lines out of Seattle and Yokohama , Tokyo . On the side of the trunk was the name Shimizu , hand-painted in large white letters . It was opened for the curious crowd . Inside were clothing , photo albums , and an old electric rice cooker . The new hotel owner explained that in the basement she had discovered the belongings of thirty-seven Japanese families who she presumed had been persecuted and taken away . Their belongings had been hidden and never recovered  --  a time capsule from the war years . <br> Henry stared in silence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hauled upstairs , the crowd marveling at the once-precious items held within : a white communion dress , tarnished silver candlesticks , a picnic basket  --  items that had collected dust , untouched , for forty-plus years . Saved for a happier time that never came . <br> The more Henry thought about the shabby old knickknacks , the forgotten treasures , the more he wondered if his own broken heart might be found in there , hidden among the unclaimed possessions of another time . Boarded up in the basement of a condemned hotel . Lost , but never forgotten . <br> Continues ...                     @x If you asked Melanie Anderson , nothing was sexier than flying . Not an eighty-five mile-per-hour ride in a Ferrari , not any chick flick out there , nothing , not even men . Not that she had anything against the penis-carrying gender , but flying was where it was at for Mel , and had been since the tender age of four , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a tree on a dare . Unfortunately , that first time the ground got in her way , breaking her fall . <p> And her ankle . <p> Her second try had come at age eight , when she 'd leapt off her granny 's second-story deck into a pile of fallen leaves . No broken ankle this time , but she did receive a nice contusion to the back of the head . <p> By age twelve , a time when most girls discovered boys and their toys , Mel had discovered airplanes , and had taken a job sweeping for tips at a local airport just to be near them . Maybe because her own home never seemed happy , maybe because she did n't have much else to look forward to , but the magic of flying was all she ever dreamed about . <p> She wanted to be a pilot . And not just any pilot , but a kick-ass pilot who could fly anywhere , anytime , and look cool while doing it . <p> Now she was twenty-six and she 'd pulled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anderson Air . That Anderson Air consisted of a single Cessna 172 and a not-exactly-air-worthy Hawker was another matter altogether . Having fueled her dreams from cardboard wings to titanium steel made her proud as hell of herself . Now , if only she could pay her bills , things would be just about perfect , but money , like man-made orgasms , remained in short supply . <p> " Mel ! Mel , sweetie , the oven is kaput again ! " <p> Mel sighed as she walked through the lobby of North Beach Airport , a small , privately owned , fixed-base operation . The cozy , sparsely decorated place was dotted with worn leather couches and low , beat-up coffee tables and potted palm trees-low maintenance to the extreme . A couple of the walls were glass , looking out onto the tarmac and the two large hangars , one of which housed the maintenance department and the other the overnight tie-down department . Beyond that lay a string of fourteen smaller hangars , all rentals . And beyond that , Santa Barbara and the Pacific Ocean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanic riding the waves on their surfboards instead of doing their job . <p> The far wall held a huge map of the world , dotted with different colored pushpins designating the places where she and everyone else had flown on various chartered flights . Red pins dominated . Mel was red , of course , and just looking at the map made her smile with pride . <p> Just past the map , the wall jutted out , opening up into the Sunshine CafT , an ambitious name for five round tables and a small bar/nook , behind which was a stove , oven , microwave , and refrigerator , all crammed into six hundred square feet and painted a bright sunshine yellow . On the walls hung photos , all of planes , and all gorgeously shot from the ground 's viewpoint . <p> Charlene Stone stood in the middle of the kitchen nook , bottle-dyed maroon hair piled on top of her head , her black lip gloss a perfect match to her black fingernails . She 'd turned forty this year and wore a T-shirt that read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of short shorts that rivaled Daisy Duke 's . As the eighties had been Char 's favorite decade to date , she had Poison blaring from a boom box on the counter while staring into the oven . " I ca n't get my muffins going , " she said in her Alabama drawl . <p> " I thought I was your muffin , baby . " <p> This from Charlene 's husband , Al , the photographer who 'd taken the pictures on the walls , who despite being forty himself had never outgrown his horny twenties . Medium height , built like the boxer he 'd once been , he waggled a brow and grinned . <p> They 'd been married forever , had in fact raised two kids while they 'd still been kids themselves , but they had empty-nest syndrome now , and were currently revisiting their honeymoon days-meaning they talked about sex often , had sex often , and talked about it some more . <p> " People come here for my muffins , " Charlene said , and smacked Al 's chest . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just kissing up now . " <p> This brought out a big , hopeful grin . " No , but I 'd like to . " He shifted close , put his hands on Char 's hips . " Kiss up , and then down ... " <p> Char shot Mel a long look . " Men are dogs . " <p> Mel tended to agree with that assessment but she knew enough to keep her tongue . " I 'll get the oven fixed . " <p> " Oh , honey , that 'd be great . I know you 're swamped and this is the last thing you need . " <p> Yep , on the list of things Mel did n't need , the oven going on the blink fell right behind a hole in her head . " We need the oven . I 'll get it fixed ASAP . " <p> " Good , because if I keep disappointing the customers , we are n't going to be able to pay our rent this month . Sally will freak . " <p> Ah , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North Beach Airport , and everyone 's boss , from fueling to maintenance to hangaring . Mel herself rented space from Sally for Anderson Air and in return for a lower fee managed the whole airport for Sally . Since Sunshine CafT happened to be one of the few profitable segments of North Beach , the broken oven fell into Mel 's already-overflowing pot of responsibilities . She pulled the radio off the clip on her belt to call their fix-it guy , who sometimes fixed things , and sometimes did n't . Mostly did n't . " I 'll get Ernest . " <p> Charlene sighed . <p> " Yeah , yeah . " Mel brought the radio up to her mouth . " Ernest , come to the cafT , please . " <p> No answer , which was not a big surprise . No one was sure exactly how old Ernest was but he 'd been at North Beach as long as Mel could remember . According to other sources , he 'd been around since the dawn of time . Only thing was , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be when Mel needed him . <p> Like now . <p> " He 's probably rescuing a spider . " To Al 's credit , he said this with a straight face . <p> Ernest loved spiders . He actually carried around a special species book in his back pocket so that he could characterize each and every spider he came across , and here just off the Santa Barbara coast , in the shadows of the Santa Ynez Mountains , he came across a lot . The only thing he loved more than spiders was computers . The man , strange as it seemed , was a computer god . He probably could have gotten a job anywhere for more money , but undoubtedly he could n't nap on the job anywhere else so he stayed at North Beach . <p> " Ernest , " Mel said again into the radio . " Come in , please . Ernest , come in . " <p> " No need to shout , missy . " <p> Mel nearly jumped out of her skin at the low , craggily , grumpy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of him packed with attitude , from his steel-toed boots to his greasy trousers and long-sleeved , button-down plaid , to his bad comb-over , which was rumpled now , telling her he 'd been sleeping in the storage closet again . The crease on his cheek that resembled the side of a can of oil was a dead giveaway . " The oven 's down , " she told him . <p> " Eh ? " He cupped a hand to his bad ear . " Speak up ! " <p> Mel would have fired his curmudgeonly ass a long time ago except she could n't afford anyone else . " Oven ! Broken ! " <p> " You never talk loud enough , " he grumbled . " Sally 's the only one who talks loud enough . " <p> Ernest had n't actually spoken directly to Sally in years , but arguing with the man was like betting against the house . <p> Never going to win . <p> " Can you fix the oven ? " she yelled in his good ear . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn fuel pump ! " <p> Mel 's stomach dropped . " What 's wrong with the gas pump ? " Muffins they could live without . Getting fuel into their customers ' aircrafts , some of which landed here daily for the fuel alone , they could not . <p> " Nothing I ca n't handle . " Ernest was already walking away , his pants slipping down because he had no hips to hold them on . He stopped , hitched them up , then kept moving . <p> The radio squawked with the announcement of an unscheduled plane arriving in twenty minutes . Mel waited for one of the linemen , Ritchie or Kellan , to respond to the news , but neither did . Once again she lifted the radio to her lips and called for her employees . <p> No response . <p> " Got ta love those brain-dead college students , " Char said . <p> Mel resisted the urge to smack her own forehead with the radio . " If those two are in the back hangar getting high again , I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart at the seams . " Charlene hugged Mel . " Look , honey , you 've got your hands full . I 'll go see what I can wrangle up without the oven , ' kay ? " <p> " I 'll get on it , " Mel promised her just as the Poison CD ended . <p> For one blessed moment silence reigned before a new CD clicked on . Journey . " I just wish we could give this place the makeover it needs , " Char yelled over the music . <p> Mel wished that , too . They were making ends meet , and they all had jobs , two really good things , but no one was getting rich , that was for sure . <p> Not that she wanted to be rich , but comfortable would be nice ... <p> Al followed his wife into the kitchen , his hand sliding down her back to squeeze her ass . <p> " Albert Edward Stone ! " Charlene said in her most Southern-genteel voice . " If you think that instead of cooking muffins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on , just a quickie- " <p> " That 's what you got just last night ! " <p> " Hey , that was n't a quickie , that was some of my best work ! " <p> Mel covered her ears and walked away . She did n't need the reminder that everyone was getting quickies and she was not . So it 'd been a long time for her , so what ? People could live without sex . <p> Or so the rumor went . <p> " Mel ? Mel , are you around here somewhere ? " <p> At Dimi 's voice drifting through the lobby from the front receptionist desk , Mel changed direction and headed that way , wondering , what now ? <p> Dimi Wilmington sat perched on the edge of her desk , head tilted as she studied the view out the window of sweeping coastlines bisected by the magnificent Santa Ynez Mountains and a typical low-lying morning fog . Willowy , with legs long past the legal limit , Dimi had a body and face that could launch a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown men on their knees to worship at her altar . <p> She used them to her full advantage , too , rarely coming across a man she did n't like-which probably explained the new whisker burn along her jaw . <p> Terrific . Everyone was getting lucky except Mel . <p> It was said she and Dimi were night and day , a modern-day odd couple . Mel being the anal one . The one who gathered worries and stress like moss on a tree . She also tended to gather the heartaches and responsibilities of others much like a fraught mother hen , bitching after all her little chicks , pecking at them until they did as she wanted them to . <p> Dimi was more a live-and-let-live type of soul . She cared , deeply , she 'd just rather light incense and meditate than actually solve a problem . She was both a thorn in Mel 's side and her closest confidant . <p> She wore a multicolored , filmy , gauzy miniskirt and a snug , white cap-sleeved tee with a pink heart in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spanking-new breasts . But the thing that never failed to amaze Mel about Dimi was that she could go all day and that bright , clean white tee would stay bright , clean white . <p> Mel did n't even bother to look down at her coveralls , already filthy from just a quick maintenance check on the Cessna . " What 's the problem ? " <p> Over the steam of her herbal tea and the faint smoke from the incense she 'd lit , Dimi shot Mel a wry smile . <p> Right . What was n't a problem was a more likely question . <p> The two of them went back a long ways . As teens , Mel had swept and assisted in the maintenance department , and Dimi had answered phones . Each had been far more at home here than either of their decidedly not Leave It to Beaver homes . <p> Sally Wells , a woman with more dream than cash , had taken them under her wing-Sally , who 'd lived as she wanted , wild and free with men and fun aplenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dimi had both worshipped the ground Sally walked on ; Mel appreciating Sally 's directness , the way she ran her own show and the world be damned , but for Dimi the worship had gone deeper . She 'd wanted to be Sally . <p> Unfortunately , Sally had been unavailable to them for a long time now , and without her around , there was no one for Mel to share the stress of holding all this up with . No one except Dimi . " Tell me , " she said to Dimi now . " Believe me , the day ca n't get worse . " <p> Dimi put her hand over Mel 's . " You look tired . You 're not drinking that tea I gave you . " <p> " I hate tea . And it 's just stress . " <p> " You only hate tea because I tell you it has healing abilities and you think that 's a crock of shit . " She sighed . " Money 's tight again . " <p> " You mean still . Money 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dimi stood and , primping a little , played with the hem of her skirt , adjusted her top . " We have a couple of hot ones coming in today . " <p> " Hot ones " being Dimi-code for cute , rich customers . <p> " What we have is an unscheduled , " Mel said . " I 've got ta get out there and do tie-down because God knows where Ritchie or Kellan is . " <p> Dimi pulled out a compact and checked her gloss , ran her tongue over her teeth . " I 'll do it . " <p> " Uh-huh . " Mel eyed the short , short skirt , which at every move flirted with revealing Dimi 's crotch . " You 're going to go get your hands dirty , risk that manicure , and tie down a plane ? In that ? " <p> Dimi smiled . " Should get me a big tip , do n't you think ? " <p> " That 's not even funny . " <p> " Hey , I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . " <p> " Stop it . " Mel knew Dimi was only kidding . Or half-kidding anyway . Dimi enjoyed men the way some women enjoy breathing . " I have enough to worry about . " <p> Dimi sighed and stroked a long , wayward strand of hair from Mel 's face . " We 'll be fine , hon. You 'll come up with something , you always do . " <p> Right . She 'd just wave her magic wand and figure it all out . And while she was at it , she 'd conjure up a happily ever after for all of them as well . " The oven 's down , the gas pump is acting up , and morale 's getting low . " <p> " They need a phone call from Sally . " <p> Their gazes met for a long beat . <p> " You do it this time , " Dimi whispered . <p> " Actually , I was hoping you could , from- " Mel broke off when Ernest appeared out of nowhere , shuffling past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ever-present jar for liberating spiders . <p> Mel did n't know how many times she 'd asked him not to walk through the lobby like that , to instead go around the outside of the hangar , where customers would n't have to see him , but he never listened . At least not to the stuff she wanted him to . " Ernest ? " <p> He 'd stopped to stand in front of the vending machine next to the wall map , scratching his head as he contemplated rows of candy bars . " Yeah ? " <p> " Did you by any chance ever clean out that maintenance hangar , the one Danny wants to stock new parts in ? " <p> " Not yet . Busy , you know . " <p> Right . He looked really busy . She and Dimi waited until he 'd made his selection , shoved the candy bar into his pocket next to his spider book , and left . <p> " I hate the secrets , " Dimi whispered . <p> Yeah , and Mel just loved them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got ta go meet that flight . Then I have a flight myself , to LA . " <p> " You 're changing your clothes first , right ? " <p> " Yes , " Mel said with irritation . " Of course . " <p> " You say that like you do n't regularly forget to change from mechanic to pilot . Daily . " <p> Mel rolled her eyes . " I 'll be back by two . " <p> Dimi nodded , looked wistfully out the window . " You 're so lucky . " <p> " Lucky ? " Mel laughed in disbelief . " How exactly ? " <p> " You get to get out of here . " <p> " But you hate to fly , " Mel reminded her . " You throw up every time . " <p> " I know , I did n't mean ... " Dimi searched for words . " Look , do n't you ever ... just want to get in the plane and , I do n't know , fly off into the sunset ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return ? " <p> " Well ... yeah . " <p> North Beach was Mel 's home , her life , and no , she 'd never ever thought about going away and never coming back , and she 'd always figured Dimi felt just the same . " Okay , what 's wrong ? " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
