Chapter One It was three o'clock in the afternoon , on a beautiful but blowy day in mid-May , and I was as usual , in the office of the stables of the Earl of Cambridge talking with his Head Groom . I was lounging in my chair , in a most unladylike posture , when there came the sound of a carriage being driven rather precipitously into the stable yard . Clark jumped to his feet like a shot . " Lord Almighty , Miss , could that be his lordship ? " I said a little dryly , " Since I do n't know anyone else who comes sweeping in here quite so grandly , I rather imagine that it is . " Clark disappeared out the door . I slid down a little farther on my spine and idly wondered what could be bringing the Earl of Cambridge back to his ancestral home in the midst of the London Season . A brilliant ray of May sunshine came slanting in through the small office window and rested on the top of my head . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I closed my eyes to savor it . " You here , Deb ? " a familiar voice asked , and I opened my eyes to regard the man who had just come in . The Most Noble George Adolphus Henry Lambeth , Earl of Cambridge , Baron Reeve of Ormsby and Baron Thornton of Ware , stood in the door looking at me out of his famous dark eyes . " I 'm always her , " I returned mildly . " Where else am I to be-at home with Mother , gardening ? " He flashed me a swift , charming grin . " Well , since you put it like that ... " He came into the room and sat on the edge of the desk , facing my chair and swinging his leg . " The really interesting question is what are you doing here ? " I asked . " Is n't the Season still in full swing ? " " I 'm going over to Newmarket tomorrow to take a look at Highflyer , " he said . " The Derby is in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's training well . " I bolted straight up in my chair . " May I come with you ? " He sighed . " You know you ca n't do that , Deb . It ai n't proper for an unmarried lady to be alone all day with a twenty-four-year-old man . " " Fiddle , " I said vigorously . " You and I have been friends forever , Reeve . No one will think anything odd of me going to see your racehorse . " He snorted . " Wo n't they ? My reputation is not exactly spotless , Deb , and I am not going to besmirch yours . You ca n't come with me , and that is final . " I glared at him . " But it is so boring here , Reeve . The only thing the local girls do is giggle about boys and talk about getting married . It is enough to make one go stark raving mad . If I did n't have Clark to talk to , I think I should go mad . " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his booted leg and looking at me out of enigmatic eyes . " You ought to think of getting married yourself , Deb . You ca n't spend the rest of your life as a spinster , after all . " I could feel my face take on what my mother calls its stubborn look . " No one wants to marry me , Reeve . " " Do n't be ridiculous , " he said . " It 's true , " I insisted . " For one thing , I 'm too tall . " " You 're not too tall . " His straight black brows drew together . " Stand up , " he commanded . " No . " Two strong hands closed around my wrists and dragged me to my feet . " Hah ! " he said . " The top of your head only comes up to my mouth . That 's a perfectly good height for a woman . " I was annoyed . " Reeve , you are several inches over six feet . I do n't know if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall as that . They like girls whom they can look down upon . " His eyes flicked over me . " They also like girls who wear something more feminine than ancient riding skirts and jackets that look as if they were rejected by the local orphanage . " I scowled up at him . " It 's not as if you were a Valkyrie , for God 's sake , " he said . " If anything , you 're too thin . I could probably fit my hands around your waist . " " Well do n't try it , " I warned . I backed away from him and folded my arms across my breast . " How did we get started on this conversation in the first place ? " " You started it . " " I did not . " " Yes , you did . You were complaining that all the local girls are on the catch for a husband . " I leaned my hip against the desk that he had stepped away from . I shrugged . I hated to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for girls to want husbands , " Reeve went on . " I do n't know why you should find the topic so boring , Deb . " " It 's not only boring , it 's fruitless , " I said . " Not only am I too tall , but I have no money . Do n't forget that little fact , Reeve . Gentlemen are not inclined to marry a girl who is virtually destitute , which is what Mama and I are . We are lucky to have a roof over our heads . " I shook my head . " No , I fear I am doomed to a life of spinsterhood . " I must admit I was not as unhappy as perhaps I should have been about this situation . My long legs might have made some of the shorter local swains uncomfortable , but they gave me a distinct advantage in the saddle . In point of fact , except for Reeve himself , I had the best seat in the entire countryside . This was the reason that I had the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the horses were in good hands when I took them out . Realizing that he was getting nowhere with his discussion of marriage , Reeve changed the subject . " It looks as if Highflyer is going to be the favorite for the Derby , " he said smugly . " What do you think about that ? " " I think it is wonderful , " I replied slowly . " But what does Lord Bradford , your trustee , think ? " Reeve scowled . " Bernard is a spoil sport , " he said . " All he does is spout prosy speeches about the evils of racing . He has no understanding that racing is something that all real gentlemen do . He lives on that boring little estate in Sussex and does nothing but see to his farms and his flocks of geese . Wait until Highflyer wins . Then he 'll see the value of keeping a racehorse ! " I said carefully , " Reeve , where are you getting the money to have Highflyer trained ? " " Oh , Benton loaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm to repay him as soon as Highflyer wins the Derby . " A note of foreboding struck my heart . " And what if he does n't win ? " The earned me the famous Cambridge glare . " Of course he 'll win ! He 's by far the best horse in the race . That 's why he 's the favorite ! " He picked up an iron paperweight in the shape of a rearing horse and slammed it down on the copy of the Stud Book that Clark and I had been looking through . " Damn Bernard , anyway . Why does he have to make my life so difficult ? " It was a question I could n't answer . Reeve raked his hand through his dark overly long hair . " You do n't think I should have borrowed the money from Benton ? " he challenged me . I looked back at him , taking a minute to think before I answered . Even Reeve 's glower could do nothing to disguise the classical purity of his face 's bone structure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the bump in what had once been a perfectly straight nose . He had broken it when he was twelve . Someone had been riding too close behind him over a fence and crowded his horse , and both Reeve and the horse had come down . He had been laid up for weeks with broken ribs and a broken collarbone as well as the nose . I had known Reeve since I was seven , however , and I was so accustomed to his dark splendor that it rarely got in the way of my reading the inner man . So I knew now that under the bravado he too was nervous about the money he had borrowed . I also knew that he would never admit it . " It is just that I would hate to see the relationship between you and Lord Bradford deteriorate further than it already has , " I said carefully . Reeve gave a short bark of humorless laughter . " I should think that is impossible , Deb , " he said . There was no answer to that so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going home , " I said . " Mother will be looking for me . " He nodded . " I really wish I could take you to see Highflyer , Deb , but even if you could find a chaperone , I 'm not coming back here after Newmarket . " " That 's all right , Reeve , " I said resignedly . " Give my best to your mother . " " I will . " And so we parted . Highflyer lost the Derby . He stumbled on his way up the last hill and pulled up with the lower part of his leg dangling . He had snapped his canon bone . They put him down right on the Epsom course . " Oh my God , " I moaned when I read the account of the race in the Morning Post the following day . " This is terrible . Poor Reeve . What incredibly rotten luck . " " Let me see . " Mother reached across the breakfast table to take the paper from me . " Oh dear , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had finished reading the article . " Lord Bradford will be very annoyed when he learns that he has to pay out training money and now Reeve does n't even have a horse he can sell . " " It is n't just the training money , either , " I said gloomily . " Can you see Reeve not betting on his own horse ? A horse that is the Derby favorite ? " " Oh dear , " Mama said again . She knew Reeve well enough to recognize the truth of what I had just said . I did n't see him for two weeks after the Derby fiasco . Then , one hazy June morning , as I was helping Mama in her garden , which fed us for most of the summer and half of the winter , he drove his phaeton up to the front of our cottage , pulled up with his usual flourish , and jumped down . I wiped my hands on my skirt and walked over to greet him . " Hello , Reeve , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he replied shortly . In fact , he looked ill . He had lost weight , which made his high , classical cheekbones more prominent than usual , and there were noticeable shadows under his eyes . " I was so sorry to hear about Highflyer , " I said gently . " What a terrible way to lose a good horse . " He nodded tersely . Reeve had never been very good about dealing with his own feelings . At that point , my mother came up . She patted him gently on the arm and said , " It 's good to see you , Reeve . " She too knew him well enough to realize that an excess of sympathy would not be welcome . " I 've come to ask Deb to go for a drive with me , " Reeve said to Mama . " Will that be all right , Mrs. Woodly ? " " Of course , " Mama said . " Change your dress first , Deborah . You can not be seen abroad in that dirty old gown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you do n't mind , I would like to wash my hands at least , " I said mildly . " I wo n't be long . " He gave me a very somber look . " All right . " Good heavens , I thought , as I went into the cottage . Something must be very wrong indeed . Could Lord Bradford have refused to pay his debts ? A cold chill struck my heart . Surely Reeve had not gone to the moneylenders ? He would not be that stupid ! I washed my hands and face , brushed off my dress , and was back downstairs in ten minutes . Reeve was standing beside his horse , talking with Mama and looking tense . " I 'm ready , " I said lightly and let him take my hand to help me up to the high seat of the phaeton . As we rolled away down the country lane , Reeve was very silent , ostensibly concentrating on driving his matched pair of bays . I did n't say anything either . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past experience I knew I was going to have to be patient until he was ready to bring it out . Reeve steered the phaeton away from the well-kept paths and splendid gardens of Ambersly and aimed instead toward the river , following one of the local country roads that at this season were lined with leafy trees and small grassy meadows filled with wildflowers . At last he pulled off the road and stopped the horses in a small glade that was hidden from the road by a stand of graceful beech trees . He loosened his reins so the horses could stretch their necks and turned to look at me . I could hold my tongue no longer . " Whatever is the matter , Reeve ? " I asked . " Did Lord Bradford refuse to cover what you owed on the Derby ? " Dark color flushed into his cheeks . " If I live to be a hundred , Deb , I do not ever want to spend another hour such as the one I spent with Bernard after that race . He is such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He said that raceowners were a congregation of the worst blackguards in the country mixed with the greatest fools . That is what he thinks me . A fool ! " Reeve 's eyes were glittering dangerously and there was a white line around his mouth . " Lord Bradford is a very conservative man , " I said carefully . " You wo n't credit this , Deb , but he seems to have no understanding that what I owe on the Derby are debts of honor . " Reeve thrust his fingers through his dark hair . " I shall be drummed out of the Jockey Club if I do not pay up on my bets , do you realize that ? " " Of course you must pay your debts , " I said . I added carefully , " Er ... how much exactly do you owe , Reeve ? " He scowled . " I bet sixty thousand pounds on Highflyer to win . Then , of course , there is the money I borrowed from Benton for training fees . That is another ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And has Lord Bradford refused to meet your obligations ? " I asked . " He has said he will meet them , but he has made a stipulation . " For the first time he looked away from me , averting his face and staring out over the shining dappled brown backs of his standing horses . I looked in puzzlement at his profile , which was shaded by the overhanging canopy of leaves from the beeches . There was a single stripe of sunlight on the left shoulder of his rust-colored coat . " And what is the stipulation ? " I prompted when it did n't seem as if he were going to continue . I could see a muscle jump in his jaw as he clenched his teeth . " I have to get married . " I was dumbfounded . " Married ? " I echoed . " But what does getting married have to do with your debts ? " He did n't answer immediately and the truth slowly dawned on me . " Oh , I see . He has found you an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't need an heiress , Deb . Even Bernard knows that . " He turned around to look at me directly once again . " It seems that my esteemed cousin and trustee is a great believer in the settling effect of matrimony on a man . He has hopes that if I take a wife , and begin to set up my nursery , then my wildness will disappear . In fact , he has promised to give me access to half of my money when I marry and the other half if I can maintain what he calls a ' decent life ' for a year . " " Good heavens , " I said faintly . " Can he do that ? I thought your father 's will stipulated that you could not come into your inheritance until you were twenty-six . " " Apparently he left it to Bernard 's judgment to put forward the time if he felt I showed sufficient ' maturity . ' " Reeve 's gloved fingers opened and closed on the loosened reins he was holding . He added grimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inform me of until the present . " Continues ...
