<p> With Congress now backing force to oust Iraq from Kuwait , President Bush has a decent chance to win without fighting . <p> Here is what he has to do : <p> First , pause and let the message of American resolve sink into Saddam Hussein 's head . <p> Second , help fashion an Arab fig leaf to cover Iraqi withdrawal . <p> Third , provide a moment for Israel to consider doing now what it surely will do later  --  present its own plan for Mideast peace talks , to be discussed and implemented only after Iraq leaves Kuwait . This is not diplomatic linkage , but diplomatic imagination . Its aim is not to appease Iraq , but to invigorate Israel in its own longstanding interests to deal creatively with the Palestinian uprising . <p> Step one has to be a pause of some weeks . The Congressional debate was deeply emotional , as befits a decision to make war . Neither opponents nor proponents of opening the door to war now won the debate . Mr. Bush prevailed because the swing vote felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief , not because the undecided bowed to his wisdom . <p> A pause would honor the legitimate concerns of the doubters , and show that Mr. Bush is not rushing headlong into combat . Meanwhile , Saddam Hussein could look out his window daily , watching more U.S. troops arrive and waiting for the blow to fall . <p> In step two , Arabs would appeal to Saddam Hussein to quit Kuwait and not sacrifice himself , his people and Iraq to Western military technology . " The world has taken notice of what you have done for the Palestinians and the Arab nation , and you have been heard , " they could say . <p> If Saddam Hussein needs an excuse to carpet his exit from Kuwait , this might help . <p> Step three , an Israeli peace plan , is the most difficult because it must be Israel 's choice alone . It has to be presented in such a way that it does not look like a reward for Iraq . Thus there can be no external pressure and no U.S. recriminations should Israel decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems determined to do nothing at this time , Israel has good reasons to consider taking the initiative : <p> ( 1 ) If there is a war , all too many will blame Israel . Already , leaders everywhere are charging that the only obstacle to Iraq 's peaceful departure from Kuwait is Israel 's refusal to accept an international conference on the Mideast . <p> The charge unjustly equates the complicated Israeli-Palestinian situation with Iraq 's clear-cut violation of Kuwait . It also ignores the likelihood that Saddam Hussein is using the international conference as a ploy . If he got a commitment , he would demand more , stringing out the talks interminably and trying to wreck the coalition against him . <p> Israelis see the devastating punch of blame coming , and there is no need to just wait for it to land . <p> ( 2 ) Israel will have to launch a peace drive sooner or later , or risk deteriorating relations with Washington and escalating Palestinian violence . Mr. Shamir knows this , and promises proposals later . But to postpone the inevitable until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having done it sooner . <p> The good reason to delay is to avoid the appearance of rewarding Iraqi aggression . Surely , however , almost everyone would recognize that Israel would not be advancing this plan for Iraq , but for Israel and peace . <p> ( 3 ) Announcing a peace plan now allows Israel to shape the negotiations . Few Israelis like the idea of an international conference with the world ganging up against them . But that  --  or something now being concocted by Mikhail Gorbachev  --  is exactly what Israelis will face unless they offer their alternative now when others must treat it seriously . <p> All Mr. Shamir needs to do is update and get serious about the promising proposals he made two years ago , then abandoned . He could pledge to meet Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip at a fixed date , say in March , with the near-term goal of free elections followed by Palestinian self-government . He could reaffirm his recent proposal for a Mideast-wide conference on weapons of mass destruction , and use this to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's existence . <p> Mr. Shamir owes Israel this chance to carve its own path to negotiations and to insure that should war come with Iraq , the blame would fall where it belongs  --  on Baghdad . But there will be no time for this or an Arab fig leaf unless President Bush first pauses , and demonstrates that the mighty and just can afford to be patient in a final effort for peace .
