<p> Tuscaloosa , Ala. - Big day here today . Fan Appreciation Day . Last year , 15,000 folks showed up . No telling how many appreciative Alabama fans will make the pilgrimage this time , driving over from Birmingham and up from Opp , hauling in from throughout the Southeast , even flying in from as far away as Dallas , Houston and San Antonio . All of them know the Crimson Tide is back . Nearly all believe the Tide is back-to-back . <p> Bound for back-to-back national championships . <p> That fervor is evident everywhere : <p> At the Bama Fever store in the University Mall , where an official Alabama national championship coloring book sells for $ 2.95 , and a $ 3.95 infant T-shirt reads , " My first national championship T-shirt . " <p> At Alabama Express ( " Official National Championship Headquarters " ) on University Boulevard near campus , where one popular T-shirt goes for $ 16.99 . On the back ( naturally ) of the shirt are two footballs , with the years 1992 and 1993 inside them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And even on the cover of the Alabama 1993 football media guide . Beneath four color action photos and a huge shot of a diamond national championship ring is this challenge , in Crimson , capital letters : <p> DEFENDING NATIONAL CHAMPIONS . <p> Not just National Champions . Not 1992 National Champs . DEFENDING NATIONAL CHAMPIONS . <p> " Well , it 's a fact , " said Larry White , Alabama 's sports information director . " It 's something we toyed with . We felt like in the end , that was something that needed to be said . <p> " Coach Stallings will tell you it 's a matter of semantics . When you say ' defending , ' there 's a connotation that it carries over . " <p> " The mark of any champion is , he wants to defend his championship , " said Tide head coach Gene Stallings . " Whether it 's a golfer going back to the U.S. Open or a tennis player at Wimbledon . <p> " It 's not the same team here . The Dallas Cowboys are basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this team 's changed . Now , Alabama 's not changed , and we 're gon na do everything to defend our championship . " <p> In November 1991 , on the eve of Duke 's second straight national championship basketball season , Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski disdained the term " defending national champions . " <p> " Each season should be new , " he said then . " This is a different team . " <p> Told this , Stallings replies , " Does n't bother me at all . We lost 12 players off that team . But it 's still Alabama . " <p> And the Tide , once again , is on a roll . Last year produced the most harmonic of convergences . Alabama won the national championship in its centennial football season . It was the school 's 12th national title , but its first since 1979 ( when Alabama became the last team to win consecutive national titles ) . And it came at the expense of Miami - arrogant , No. 1 Miami , the defending national champion and an eight-point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ended <p> Instead , Alabama rushed for 267 yards and picked Gino Torretta bone- clean . George Teague stripped the ball from Lamar Thomas in a moment of instant legend . And the Tide shocked Miami 34-13 to set off a celebration that still has n't ended . And wo n't , until Alabama loses . The Crimson Tide enters the season on a 23-game winning streak . <p> " Oh , they Tide fans want to do it again , " Stallings said , smiling . " The great majority of places , people 'd be happy with a national championship . People in Alabama want to do it again . <p> " Everybody has that hope in the beginning of the year , but people in Alabama are more expectant . They 're not hostile about it , or vocal about it . It 's something for them to rally around , talk about . It 's something to enjoy . I like it , really . I like the enthusiasm , excitement and expectations people have . " <p> People like Minnie Burdette . " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant manager of Bama Fever . " The number 1 on the helmet that goes around ? Just $ 44 . They sold really well . I have one of them , too , but I wore my BAMA watch today . " <p> Actually , Burdette has three Alabama watches that she regularly rotates . The Tuscaloosa woman , 54 , is standing beneath a store sign that begins , " Alabama National Champion , " lists the years of ' Bama 's 12 national titles , then advises , " And More To Come ! ! " <p> She is surrounded by things connected with the national championship : national championship mugs , tire covers , mirrors , cocktail and shot glasses , trash cans , books , portraits . " We 've sold a lot , " said Burdette . " We 're low . We 've only got one cap left and very , very few shirts . I think everyone has a cap . We 've even had to mail things all over the country , to people who never lived in Alabama . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we won a national championship . People were hungry for it . " <p> Hungry enough to buy more than 800,000 copies of three commemorative editions of Sports Illustrated . Hungry enough for 15,000 to attend a " Salute to Champions " awards banquet last January , and 50,000 to line a national championship parade the next morning . Hungry enough to buy 150,000 cases of commemorative bottles and cans of Coca-Cola . <p> And hungry enough to buy 40,000 national championship T-shirts and sweatshirts in January alone . " The crown jewel of our marketing plan was to win the national championship , " said Finus Gaston , Alabama 's associate director of business services and purchasing manager . " We 've doubled our royalties income in the last year . ' <p> Teague subject of paintings <p> There are numerous painted renderings of Teague 's Sugar Bowl strip of Thomas , variously titled , " Determination , " " Take Away , " " The Strip " and simply , " The Play . " Some are displayed at the Paul Bryant Museum , no longer just an Alabama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern artifacts : three of Alabama 's four ' 92 national championship trophies are on display . <p> Artist Daniel Moore was commissioned to do a national championship print . It came in different sizes , priced from $ 175-$ 600 . All 19,000 copies sold out in six weeks . <p> " The frenzy , " Gaston calls it all . Gaston , 42 , graduated from Alabama in 1973 and later earned his master 's and doctorate here . As an undergrad , he was the head manager of the football team . His father was Alabama 's sports information director from 1952-61 . <p> " I 've been around a lot of these championships before , but nothing like this , " said Gaston . " Because of the historical significance of the championship , tied to the centennial , first time since ' 79 and the way we won - an underdog , plodding along - it 's almost a fairy tale come true . Obviously , the euphoria of the national championship has not worn off . All the fans are optimistic . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games will be against teams with losing records in ' 92 . The Tide has seven home games and plays only three games outside the state : at Vanderbilt , South Carolina and Ole Miss . Should Alabama return to the second SEC championship game - and it 's listed on every Alabama football schedule , Dec. 4 - that will again be played at Legion Field in Birmingham . <p> Bookend defensive ends Eric Curry and John Copeland wo n't be there . They 're gone to the NFL , along with Teague and running back Derrick Lassic . But the secondary ( especially Antonio Langham ) is superb , the linebackers sound , " The Deuce " still loose . <p> David Palmer , No. 2 , is still running pass routes and returning kicks . The offensive line is deep and experienced . Quarterback Jay Barker , 17-0 as a starter , should become a potent passer . <p> " We should be a little bit better offensively than defensively early , " said Stallings . But if Barker blossoms , the defense develops and the schedule is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be most appreciative . And the Tide may be back-to-back . <p> " We 're ready for a repeat , " said Minnie Burdette . " This was supposed to be the year we were supposed to win it . That 's what Coach Stallings told us : We were a year away . So everybody now is looking for this year , too . " <p> Next stop : Florida .
