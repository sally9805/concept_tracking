The scene : a couple is ordering dinner in a restaurant . The husband goes first . " Hmm , nice menu . I think I 'll have the Chilean sea bass . " <P> " Harry ! Remember the ad in the New York Times saying that when those ships net sea bass , they kill millions of birds . " <P> " Oh , right , maybe the swordfish then . " <P> " No ! They 're being fished to extinction . Did n't you hear about the boycott ? " <P> " O.K. I 'll go with the vegetable platter . What can be wrong with corn ? " <P> " Are you kidding ? Genetically modified corn may kill monarch butterflies . " <P> " May I at least have a salad ? I have to eat before we go to Home Depot . " <P> " You know we ca n't shop there , Harry . That ad last year said they purchase wood from an endangered rain forest in Canada . " <P> " Ha ! Not so fast . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for changing its purchasing policies . " <P> With newspaper ads urging us to save the oceans and forests , and TV spots about global warming , conservation groups are making more noise than ever . The violence of fringe anarchists stole headlines at Seattle 's World Trade Organization meeting , but more noteworthy was the huge peaceful demonstration by greens seeking to make sure trade pacts do not sacrifice the environment . <P> Politicians are paying attention . President Clinton just toughened restrictions on auto emissions , and with the environment expected to be big in the 2000 campaign , Al Gore and Bill Bradley are fighting for backing from eco-groups . As environmental concern becomes a core value in the U.S.  --  and in all other industrial nations  --  conservationists realize they can call on voters and consumers to hold slippery politicians and corporations to account . <P> If the Home Depot campaign is an indication , the greens have a good strategy . Reluctant to be called anti-business , they refer to " market campaigns " rather than consumer boycotts . To deter corporations from taking timber from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's largest vestige of coastal temperate rain forest , the Rainforest Action Network , along with the Sierra Club and other groups , used a stick and carrot on the big customers of lumber companies . The activists blasted Home Depot for buying Great Bear wood , but when the chain stopped , they ran ads praising the decision . <P> Other initiatives come from the deep pockets of eco-conscious foundations , such as the Pew Charitable Trust ( assets : $4.7 billion ) and the Packard Foundation ( $17 billion ) . Next year , for example , the Monterey Bay Aquarium , with money from Packard , will lead a movement to persuade consumers to stop eating the endangered Chilean sea bass  --  similar to last year 's campaign that urged diners to " give the swordfish a break . " Says Julie Packard , vice chairman of the foundation and executive director of the aquarium : " Government regulations change with each new Administration . Consumer choices can have more lasting effects . " <P> To many environmentalists , the most important issue of all is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public  --  and urge reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions  --  the National Environmental Trust and the Union of Concerned Scientists have raised $11 million to launch history 's largest eco-ad campaign .
