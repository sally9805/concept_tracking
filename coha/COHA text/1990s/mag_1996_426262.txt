Unbound by deregulation , ATT wants to get over $50 billion a year from new businesses by 2005 . The plans are drawn , and the key people are in place . Headnote Now all they have to do is execute . // SITTING IN HIS OFFICE on a frozen morning at the end of a very long winter , AT &T; CEO Robert Allen bears the oppressed demeanor of a character in a Kafka story-perhaps because the press and the body politic have lately been treating him as if he 'd turned into a giant insect . The worst blow in the recent public pasting he has endured landed when Newsweek branded him a " corporate killer " for cutting 40,000 jobs while collecting a huge bonus . Now the company 's new annual report reveals just how much he lost on the takeover and coming disgorgement of computer maker NCR , which , despite AT &T's; efforts to digest it , will have passed through Ma Bell like a large stone through a goose . In response , he is struggling to mount a PR counteroffensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welltrained people he just laid off . " I 've been better , " Allen says in a voice even softer than his usual pianissimo . The pressure comes at a pivotal moment for both Allen and the 120-year-old corporation that he runs , as AT &T; prepares to split itself in three . The biggest piece-the one that will continue to wear the AT &T; nameplate-is mainly a long-distance company today And the job it faces is daunting : nothing less than redefining what a communications company does . As president and chief operating officer Alex Mandl says , with unusual understatement : " Therein lies the excitement of the new AT &T."; Therein also lies the risk . While the company 's ambitious plan is simple enough in concept , it will be devilishly hard to pull off . After the trivestiture is completed early next year , the long-distance business will still be AT &T's; crown jewel , and the company will seek to keep its setting polished and sound . But lest its diamond turn into a cubic zirconium , AT &T; must quickly nurture a host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical goals : generating cash , locking in long-distance customers , and restoring a direct link into people 's houses-a link that was lost when the Baby Bells became the owner of the telephone line into the home in 1984 . So starting this year , AT &T; will reenter the local phone business in all 50 states . It will push to finish building its wireless network , the most extensive in the U.S. It will hook up computer users to the Internet . And it will market digital satellite TV . It will sell these services in bundles , giving a greater discount the more a customer buys , and will rely on the power of its brand name to lock in long-distance users before newcomers poach them . The extent to which AT &T; is counting on these new services is startling . Mandl says that a decade from now , businesses other than long distance will account for over 50% of total revenues . That means services from which AT &T; earned not a cent 18 months ago would account for over 80% of future revenue growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth rate over this ten-year period , a far faster pace than the old AT &T; has managed . In all , sales for the new AT &T; would swell from $51 billion last year to around $130 billion in 2005 . Telecom analyst William Deatherage of Bear Stearns says , " That 's clearly what they have to do , and it is attainable . It 's all in the execution . " The metamorphosis of AT &T; became urgent with the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , which will break down the barriers between telecom 's separate fiefdoms . When this happens , the industry will unbundle in the same way the computer business did when IBM 's hegemony was broken in the early 1980s , and unleash , among other things , lower margins , higher volumes , and stiffer competition . Compared with what 's ahead today 's long-distance wars will seem like a game of croquet on a manicured lawn . To thrive , the new AT &T; will have to perform a lot better than the old AT &T.; The company 's latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results for what will soon be three new companies-NCR , the computer company ; Lucent Technologies , the telephone equipment manufacturer ; and the new AT &T,; which will include the cellular-phone and REPORTER ASSOCIATE Sheree R. Curry credit-card businesses in addition to long distance . That breakout underlines the extent of the company 's dependence on long-distance income . Over the past three years , NCR toted up losses of $2.8 billion ; the equipment company delivered only $630 million in operating income , including $2.8 billion in restructuring and other charges last year . By comparison , the communications company racked up $19.7 billion in operating profits . Photograph ROBERT ALLEN CEO // Think of it this way : The new AT &T; is putting itself on the line . It will have neither the security of being leader of a cozy long-distance oligopoly nor the excuse of those weaker hardware units to blame for slow growth or a slumping share price . As general counsel John Zeglis puts it , " There 's no place to hide , no cash cow to cover current mistakes and wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do it fast . It 's a jolt , the back against the wall . " Zeglis is one of the four men of a strippeddown chairman 's office that will steer the new AT &T; He and Allen are old Bellheads ; the other two members are Mandl , the suave and forceful chief operating officer and a former head of shipping giant Sea-Land Service , and chief financial officer Richard Miller , a veteran of corporate restructurings at Penn Central , RCA , and Wang . This quadrumvirate supersedes a 15-person executive committee that often took weeks or months to make decisions that could have been settled in hours . Photograph ALEX MANDL President &; COO // That structure clearly had to change . Indeed , if the company 's historical edge was size-the unmatched scope and scale of its long-distance network-speed may hold the key to its future . The new AT &T; ca n't afford prolonged deliberations as it tries to respond quickly to varied demands from more knowledgeable customers , to trends in technology , to curve balls from regulators , and above all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them are the Baby Bells , who have one huge edge : They own the wires that snake into every household , making it technically easier for them to offer a wider range of services more quickly . AT &T; will try to keep them out of its water for as long as possible by drawing them into the still vast Sargasso Sea of regulatory Washington . The new telecom act , which lays out a checklist that the Bells must satisfy before they can enter the longdistance business , is a monument to ambiguity . Expect to find AT &T's; legal department splitting more hairs than Sweeney Todd . Zeglis will wield the legal scalpel . Boyish and earnest , Zeglis composes palindromesphrases that read the same backwards or forwards-in his spare time ( " Sit on a potato pan , Otis , " was one he shared in a recent interview . " Star comedy by Democrats , " he added , as if to explain ) . While he freshens the air around AT &T,; his effect on the Baby Bells may be more purgative than tonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for permission to carry long-distance service in a new state . He will also defend AT &T; against Baby Bell counterattacks . In the latest of many lawsuits , Bell Atlantic , his most persistent gadfly , is seeking $3.5 billion in damages , alleging that AT &T; refused to make phone switches that can plug-and-play with ones made by other manufacturers . Palindromes fail Zeglis when he is asked about Bell Atlantic . He says : " Almost no words of profanity work both backwards and forwards . " His animus will likely swell . The fate of the new AT &T; hinges on how successfully it reenters the $90-billion-ayear local phone business . Bob Allen 's audacious aim is to claim a third of that market in five to ten years-thus accounting for $30 billion of the $80 billion in new revenue the company wants by 2005 . While the Bells maintain that state the same provider . " In other words , AT &T; feels that to keep its long-distance customers , it has to sign them up for local service too . AT &T's; biggest problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' plant-phone lines , switching centers , and the like-in most local markets it wants to enter . No one can . So it has to rent space on somebody else 's network . But which somebody ? Cable TV systems wo n't be able to carry lots of phone calls for a while . Bypass companies like Teleport Communications Group and MFS Telecom are beefing up local fiber-optic lines but for the most part do n't stretch their tendrils into residential neighborhoods . That leaves the Baby Bells as wholesaler of first resort . And that is a headache . The Bells are in no hurry to offer AT &T; the wholesale discounts it is seeking-25% or more . A potential deal to rent hundreds of thousands of local lines from Ameritech , the Baby Bell headquartered in Chicago , has meandered at a stately pace since the middle of last year . AT &T; accuses Ameritech of foot-dragging . Ameritech fires back that AT &T; is to blame . In a recent interview , Ameritech CEO Richard Notebaert 's face grows ruddy with chagrin . " Nothing will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " They must be in disarray . We 're dealing with their third negotiating team . " He throws his hands up in disgust . " I 'm sure they 'll straighten it out , but they 've got a problem . " " When you do something the first time , you do n't do it perfectly , " Mandl admits . " It may not have been the effort we would have liked . But I would say to Mr. Notebaert that Ameritech was n't perfect either . " // After shedding Lucent and NCR , AT &T; aims to grow by 10% a year . Here is what it may look like if it succeeds . // AT &T; can only hope that the company 's expansion of its wireless business goes more smoothly . Mandl says the company looks to build revenues from $3 billion last year to $20 billion by 2005 . This is one arena in which AT &T's; mass should still confer an advantage . The number of cellular providers could triple in the next few years , with the newcomers competing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , churn , or the rate that customers switch providers , will soar . Profit margins will head in the opposite direction , since cellular companies bribe new customers by giving away free phones , and since new customers tend to spend less than old ones , according to the Yankee Group , a Boston research firm . If AT &T; can entice enough customers to buy both cellular and long-distance service , it could tolerate a lower margin than most of its wireless rivals . Freedom from the other arms of AT &T; will at least make the wireless unit more nimble . Steve Hooper , AT &T's; wireless chief , is nearly as happy about the spinoff of Lucent as the people who work at the equipment maker ( see box ) . Shortly after AT &T; assumed ownership of McCaw in 1994 , the wireless unit decided against using AT &T; gear to build a cellular system in India . Hooper says : " We had to spend a lot of time with Alex . I 'm sure he had to take the heat . It put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And wasted a lot of time . The experience of integrating McCaw with AT &T; may have taught Mandl and others a thing or two about the need to act with alacrity Two recent moves into new businesses-the company 's latest Internet offering and its purchase of a slice of DirecTv , a satellite TV service  --  caught the industry by surprise . Photograph RICHARD MILLER CFO // AT &T's; Internet play comes in the wake of some false starts with online services that disappeared in about the time it takes to boot up a computer . The new service , though , is a deft bid that may transform the online industry while helping to protect AT &T's; long-distance revenue . AT &T; will give its long-distance customers five hours of free Internet access every month for a year , or $5 off the monthly rate for unlimited use . Daniel Briere , president of TeleChoice , a Verona , New Jersey , consulting firm , believes AT &T; will turn people into net surfers by the millions . " AT &T; will suck them all in , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one else in the industry could . " But the transformation wo n't happen overnight ; swamped by demand following its February 27 announcement , the company had to remind customers that it was going to phase in the service over several months . AT &T; also plans to use the Internet to offer new services to its business customers , especially those with 800 numbers , and make it easier for them to keep shop on the World Wide Web . AT &T; will help virtual shopkeepers process orders and will guarantee the safety of purchases made by users of its Universal Card . Internet commerce is tiny , for now : Last year , according to Jupiter Communications , a New York research firm , sales on the Web totaled only $132 million . But AT &T; likes the idea of getting a piece of every transaction on a more consumerfriendly Web . As Mandl sees it , online services will bring in 10% of AT &T's; revenues by 2005 , or about $13 billion a year . If electronic commerce really takes off , it could help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional telephone business . Says John Petrillo , the head of corporate strategy : " People who see this as a win-lose game between us and the Baby Bells are missing the point . " Petrillo sees the telecommunications pie growing bigger and bigger , at the expense of other industries , like , say , transportation . He believes this shift portends a day when goods such as books are shipped around the country electronically and published in many places , rather than printed centrally , shipped , and warehoused . " We will rip the economic surplus out of transport , " he says . That 's a pretty lofty , not to mention long-term , mission . AT &T's; DirecTv deal , by contrast , smacks much more of the here and now . It rounds out AT &T's; portfolio with a touch of Hollywood . The highly popular service , owned by GM 's Hughes Electronics division , beams cable TV and sports programming to owners of 18-inch dishes . AT &T; bought 2.5% of the company for $138 million and has an option to buy more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division and offer discounts to subscribers who take both . Photograph JOHN ZEGLIS General Counsel // AT &T; executives took only three days to approve the deal . CFO Miller says , " In the old structure it would have taken weeks . We would have had meetings with people from every division asking what it meant for their business . " Despite its newfound speediness , AT &T; still has to prove it can cultivate new businesses . Today Alex Mandl may swear that the company 's latest Internet vision is n't just another mirage , but a year ago he was lauding AT &T; Interchange , a proprietary online service that 's now history . So is Network Notes , a work-sharing software service developed in partnership with Lotus . A host of other investments in small outfits like EO and General Magic never really panned out either . All in all , a spotty record for a company setting out to find $65 billion in revenues from businesses it is just entering . Bell Atlantic Chairman Ray Smith , a veteran of the original breakup , thinks his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People inside AT &T; are really confused now , " he says . " We were not confused in 1983 and 1984 . We were n't right . But we were not confused . " To put confusion behind and matters of substance ahead , CFO Miller intends to be done with the restructuring as soon as possible . Miller took Penn Central through bankruptcy , reorganized Wang , and merged GE 's consumer electronics business with RCA 's . " I 've been involved with some restructurings that have gone on for a good deal of time , " he says . " Employee morale gets worse the longer they take . Customers want to see finished plans . " But will AT &T's; newest split-up really be different from the last one , which dragged on for years ? When the recent layoffs were announced , much was made of the huge size of AT &T's; central staff , which included between 800 and 900 public relations people . So how many will be left in the three new companies after the cuts ? Between 700 and 800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive wing . Who will be running this new show ? After Allen announced the trivestiture last September , he said he would spend the next year managing the split while Alex Mandl ran the future AT &T.; Many onlookers assumed that after guiding the company into the promised land of independence , Allen would retire to the links , leaving AT &T; to Mandl , the heir apparent ever since he took the reins of the communications division in 1993 . Mandl , 52 , is a man of supreme self-confidence and the sort of flashy , urbane European charm that would make for a good James Bond villain . As it happens , he bears a passing resemblance to the actor Klaus Maria Brandauer , who did play a Bond villain and who , like Mandl , was born in Austria during World War II . One imagines that Mandl must be champing at the bit . But his ascendance wo n't happen quite as soon as people imagined . Allen now asserts that he will retire only when he turns 65 in the year 2000 . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " We 're in such a critical stage . I can be in a good position to make key strategic decisions . " That would seem to mean less authority for Mandl . As COO of the new AT &T,; he will be responsible for pretty much the same range of businesses that he is now . Yet the man he is reporting to would suddenly have a narrower focus-the same span of control as Mandl , rather than the overarching purview of the soon-to-be-sundered empire . In fact , the arrangement may work out just fine . In his operating capacity , Mandl at least sounds as if he 's running the company . He has his own ten-year master plan , which formed the basis for much of his discussion with FORTUNE . ( The plan is also codified in a document someone leaked to New York magazine for use in a story Mandl calls " an absolute piece of shit . " ) And he sounds as if he appreciates Allen 's presence in Basking Ridge . " I 've got my plate full , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get . " Allen 's laid-back manner and lack of hubris could make him amenable to Mandl 's activist role . Their division of labor stands out in sharp relief in the way they talk about AT &T's; future , with Mandl describing the fine brushwork of strategy , Allen speaking in broad strokes . In a way , Mandl will be prime minister to Allen 's monarch . Just like in Europe . AS HEAD OF STATE , Allen is the one who bears the brunt of the invective aimed at AT &T.; The day after the " corporate killer " article appeared on the cover of Newsweek , he was visibly distraught . And he has recently been lambasted , in the pages of this magazine and the Wall Street Journal , for the dismal failure of NCR . Yet his decision to stick around till retirement fits with his temperament . His ties to the company are long and deep . His one display of alarm in an interview is over an erroneous report that he had sold most of his AT &T; shares . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stock options he had to exercise before they expired . " Other than that , the only AT &T; shares I have ever sold were to buy my first house in 1961 , " he says . " I sold 20 shares . I was so poor that my former girlfriend 's brother sold them at no commission . He knew I did n't have a pot to piss in . " He falters over the penultimate word of the last sentence . It 's the sort of remark you 'd expect to hear from Mandl . Perhaps his younger colleague has helped Allen develop an edge . Perhaps Allen will temper Mandl 's brash nature . If the two find the right chemistry , they may help AT &T; weather the years ahead better than it has the past few . <p>
