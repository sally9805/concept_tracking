In an ancient hilltop monastery in Macedonia , a young monk named Kiril ( Gregoire Colin of Olivier , Olivier ) finds a frightened girl ( Labina Mitevska ) hiding in his cell . She is , we learn , the victim of ethnic hatred , and once her enemies track her down , the peace of this retreat is violently , permanently shattered . <P> In a London restaurant Anne ( Katrin Cartlidge of Naked ) and her estranged husband meet to discuss their problems . Their conversation is interrupted by a loud argument between a waiter and a customer . The customer leaves , then returns and sprays the room with shots , killing the husband , among others . <P> A famous photographer , Aleksander ( played by a fine actor of the former Yugoslavia , Rade Serbedzija ) , who has become famous and burned-out taking pictures of war and its victims , returns to his native Macedonian village seeking peace . What he finds instead are Christians and Muslims feuding bitterly . He is at last caught in the kind of deadly cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives and deaths are ultimately linked in writer-director Milcho Manchevski 's intricately structured Before the Rain , an Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Film . Anne and Aleksander are lovers  --  that is why her marriage is in trouble  --  while the refugee hiding in the monastery is the daughter of Aleksander 's former lover . Even when the connections between characters are not that intimate , they sometimes know one another by sight , because commerce and communications keep shrinking the world . War zones nowadays have area codes , and the vision of a terrorist with a Kalashnikov in one hand and a cellular phone in the other , talking to some faraway co-conspirator ( or maybe his mother ) , is not farfetched . Manchevski makes this point almost surrealistically : his peasant gunmen go about their bloody business clad in Nikes and other American-made sports gear . <P> But wardrobe merely hints at a larger linkage that Manchevski , a young Macedonian filmmaker who somehow ended up at Southern Illinois University and moved on to music videos , wants to make . It is put simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film : " War is a virus , " meaning that , in an era of ethnic and religious conflict , the disease can be carried everywhere by impassioned terrorists and can infect anyone-in this case the young priest , the isolated Anne ( who works as a photo editor , coolly studying images of violence ) or even the seemingly well-inoculated Aleksander , who has seen and recorded most of the horrors of our time yet remains physically unscathed . <P> Telling his story in three movements ( Words , Faces and Pictures ) , Manchevski deliberately blurs group identities . You have to strain to understand what ideals the people in this film are willing to die for ( and , more to the point , kill for ) . One 's idea of God as opposed to another 's ? The heritage of one 's blood as opposed to that of someone else 's ? As we lean in to catch their garbled , often hysterical self-justifications , we also catch a larger point  --  that none of these principles is worth a single human life . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those afflicting the former Yugoslavia is generalized , or attributed to cosmic forces , individuals who may be guilty of terrible crimes escape just condemnation .
