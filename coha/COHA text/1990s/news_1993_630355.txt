<p> The kid at the corner of the bar in Skull 's Rainbow Room in downtown Nashville orders another bottle of beer and asks a stranger what he thinks of country music 's new Entertainer of the Year . <p> He says he does n't know many folks who have lots of Vince Gill records , nor does he know anyone who rushes out to see him in concert . The kid , a son of Waylon Jennings , looks at his beer , takes a long drag off his cigarette and says , " lapdog . " <p> About a quarter-century ago , Willie Nelson , Waylon and Kris Kristofferson hung out at Skull 's , at the heart of a honky-tonk strip called Printer 's Alley . Among them , they have just one Entertainer of the Year Award , Nelson 's 1979 honor . Willie , Waylon and Kris are many things . <p> But they are not lapdogs . <p> David " Skull " Schulman , 71 , has been running the place for 51 years . He earned his nickname after his skull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson and the Highwaymen ( Willie , Waylon , Kris and Johnny Cash ) adorn the club , which is done in an early 1960s motif of red lights and blue eyes crying in the beer . " I met Willie when he sold ( the 1963 Ray Price hit ) ' Night Life ' for $ 250 to buy a car , " Skull says . " We 've been friends since . " <p> Nelson 's love-hate relationship with Nashville has become legendary . The newest member of Country Music 's Hall of Fame ( who will make his debut at the Paramount Arts Centre in Aurora later this month ) first came to Nashville back in 1960 . Within five years , he was disenchanted with the Nashville Sound , then defined by lush strings and emotive backing choirs . The funky Skull 's , so far away from Music Row in both distance and doctrine , provided respite . But after a December , 1970 , fire gutted his home in Ridgetop , Tenn. , Nelson returned to his native Texas , and turned his back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to do what I wanted to do back in Texas , " Nelson says during a conversation on his Silver Eagle Honeysuckle Rose bus . " There was no one there saying , ' You ca n't do that . ' On the other hand , I can understand when a guy 's putting up a lot of money , he wants to call the shots . That 's where the problem comes in . " <p> Nelson arrived in Nashville in a rickety 1951 Buick he had driven from Pasadena , Texas . He already had composed " Crazy , " " Night Life " and " Funny How Time Slips Away , " but they did n't become hits <p> until he hit Nashville . " I thought I 'd come in and take over , " he says with a laugh . " It did n't take long to see that was not going to happen . <p> " Still , I was lucky . I was only here a few months before I had some success and met guys like Hank Cochran ( who co-wrote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' She 's Got You ' ) , Billy " The Travelin ' Texan Walker and Faron Young . They helped me a lot in this town . They recorded my songs and loaned me money . Billy let me move in his house . Hank got me a job writing songs for Ray Price . " <p> Price , who later helped discover Kristofferson , was a co-owner of Pamper Music , which is how Cline found " Crazy . " Faron Young had a hit with Nelson 's " Hello Walls . " Nelson also landed a job as bass player in Price 's Cherokee Cowboy Band . <p> " You know , I never played bass before , " says Nelson , sitting in front of a snapshot of Neil Young and an autographed glossy of the Miami Dolphins cheerleaders . " But I thought I could learn by the time we got to Winchester , Va . ( Texas steel-guitar player ) Jimmy Day taught me to play the bass I would need to play for Ray 's show on a ride between Nashville and Winchester . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a very good bass player , but I 'm not sure Ray knew . " <p> During the early 1960s , Skull 's was the place to kick back . But a couple of blocks away , next to the Ryman Auditorium , was Tootsie 's Orchid Lounge , where young songwriters did their woodshedding . Nelson met Cochran at Tootsie 's , and he wrote with the legendary Harlan Howard , who also arrived in Nashville in 1960 , there . <p> " Some of the songs that we wrote in there , probably he and I are the only ones who remember , " Nelson says . " Ask Harlan about ' Wanted , One Mother , ' " and Nelson warbles , " For one little boy/cleans up his room/puts away all his toys . . . It 's the saddest song you ever heard . Harlan and I wrote that one . " <p> In a separate interview , Howard says , " Sometimes when the arthritis bothers me and the eyes are going bad , I think , ' God , I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . Because if I was young again , I could n't have been here then . To come here in 1960 was watching the spermatozoan meet the ( egg ) . It was the birth , the creation . <p> " Mel Tillis and Boudleaux and Felice Bryant had n't been here long . Willie came in then , Hank Cochran , Roger Miller . . . there was a handful of hellacious songwriters at Tootsie 's , writers singing to other writers . There was one guitar we would pass around , and we 'd all sing a song or two . But the one guy who really sang all night long was Willie Nelson . <p> " Back then , I never thought of him as a singer . But when the rest of us had all lost interest , he 'd sit up there with a steel guitar player and do that jazz stuff ( his trademark back phrasing ) . I never liked jazz of any kind , where you remodel the lyrics and rephrase them . <p> " But it 's kind of like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a damn , yet he 's got this unique sound in his voice that 's charming . <p> " Willie liked all that , and now I understand . It was a training ground for him . We competed heavily with what had been here . We wiped them out and did n't even know it . We had all these songs in our minds , our hearts and even in our briefcases . Everybody comes to town with their little bag of tricks , and we sure had ours . <p> " And if that got boring , we 'd go chase girls or something . " <p> A bittersweet victory <p> Nelson 's election to the Hall of Fame was somewhat bittersweet , since he was up against close friends . Ray Price was nominated , as was Nelson 's old " Pancho &; Lefty " compatriot Merle Haggard . Don Gibson was another nominee , as was Howard , who wrote the Ray Charles hit " Busted , " Price 's " Heartaches by the Number " and Buck Owens ' " I 've Got a Tiger by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird about the Hall of Fame , " Nelson says . " I 'm close with all of them . Harlan and Hank had already written ' I Fall to Pieces ' when I got to town . Harlan and I got to be pals . We 'd hang out and write together and party together . In fact , it was at a Christmas party out at Harlan 's house where I met Jerry Wexler . " <p> Nelson 's affiliation with Wexler is considered the spark that ignited his commercial breakthrough . As Atlantic 's vice president , Wexler helped steer the course of contemporary R &B; with Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin , but he was deeply attracted to Nelson 's jazzy cadent slur . <p> Total autonomy <p> Wexler gave Nelson total autonomy . Nelson responded by recruiting everyone from his sister Bobbie on piano to Doug Sahm , Larry Gatlin , Jimmy Day and even the Memphis Horns . In five days , Nelson and this crew recorded three albums worth of material . Nelson 's first Atlantic album , " Shotgun Willie " ( 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical liberation paralleled his 1970 exodus from Nashville . " The truth about me leaving , musically , is that with economics I decided to narrow the area I was playing , " Nelson says . " Instead of trying to go all over the world with a six-piece band , I decided to go back to Texas and just work places I knew in Texas , Oklahoma , Louisiana and New Mexico . <p> " I knew I could do just as well and play to as many people . I had been doing it for years ; it 's just that the rest of the country had not responded as quickly . So I moved back to where the best audience was . " <p> These days , when Nelson is n't on his bus , he still resides in Texas , outside Austin . The years have turned good again for Nelson , who was 60 on April 30 . <p> Besides the Hall of Fame honors , Nelson calls his newest album , " Across the Borderline , " " one of the better ones " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works , and the project will be produced by Don Was , who produced " Borderline . " Nelson has also trimmed his $ 16 million Internal Revenue Service debt . Earlier this year , he agreed to a compromise offer with the IRS ; he 's paying off the entire tax portion of the debt , amounting to some $ 6 million , as well as an additional $ 3 million in interest and penalties . <p> So is 1993 a comeback year ? <p> " Yeah , why not ? " Nelson says , looking out his bus window into a bright Indian summer afternoon . " It 's definitely an improvement . " @x WASHINGTON CAN YOU BELIEVE IT ? In the public prints , I have been called a " pipsqueak , " and a " self-important pipsqueak " at that . The scene of the crime is Forbes magazine . The felon is Jonathan Yardley , an elderly book critic at the Washington Post . Yardley was asked by Forbes if any of the " current crop of right-wing pundits " is comparable to H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work in the 1920s . I was referred to along with Ann Coulter ( who apparently told CNN in 2006 that she is " the right-wing Mencken " ) , Mark Steyn , and P. J. O'Rourke . Yardley went on to say , " I do n't respect a single one of them , much less think that a single one of them deserves to be compared to H.L.M. " I have read Yardley for years , often finding him informative though occasionally disingenuous . Certainly his disapproval of " self-importance " is disingenuous . When he hands down his judgments the organ music is rumbling in his head , the incense filling the room- the holy man hath spoken . As for the comparisons of me with Mencken , I would have thought that my appraisal of him seven years back would have disqualified me for further consideration . In The American Spectator I reviewed a couple of convincing biographies of " the Sage " and concluded that he was a very amusing , albeit wrongheaded , writer of brilliant prose , who by the 1930s " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crank . " Yet he was also a fine philologist and editor . The American Mercury , which he founded in 1924 with George Jean Nathan and Alfred A. Knopf , was an exhilarating departure from the musty magazines that preceded it , and the Mercury allowed him to become America 's first celebrity intellectual . He was pronounced by the likes of Walter Lippmann and the editors of the New York Times a powerful intellectual force . " The most powerful private citizen in the United States , " is how the Times put it . Still , after championing a wave of novelists in the 1920s and celebrating the musical masters of the 18th and 19th centuries , he showed no taste for later literary movements and almost no interest in any of the other arts . During years when Eliot , Pound , and Yeats were at work , Mencken dismissed poetry as " beautiful balderdash . " Despite access to some of the finest minds of his time ( he died in 1956 , age 75 ) , he missed practically every important historic current swirling around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is little evidence that he recognized the wonders on the horizon . He also missed the rise and fall of dictatorship , and dismissed democracy 's challenge to the dictators as demagoguery . Hitler struck him as " a shabby ass " and an Austrian William Jennings Bryan . As he saw it , World War II was " a wholly dishonorable and ignominious business . I believe that that will be history 's verdict upon it . " On large matters he was almost always wrong . He was a very funny writer until his antidemocratic and anti-religious jokes overwhelmed his other jokes and lost the capacity to make readers laugh . That would be in the 1930s and 1940s . In those days he was largely out of the public eye . He attended to his great study of the American language and to notes and memoirs that did not come out until after his death , in some cases not until the 1980s and 1990s . The writings reveal an angry , often confused , bigot and crank . He did publish three merry volumes of autobiography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest escapism . As was true through much of Mencken 's life , the popular press misperceived him . Time described him in 1943 as " the nation 's comical , warm-spirited , outstanding village atheist . " The following year , the " warmspirited " Sage publicly observed to the interviewer Bob Considine that World War II is " a better state than peace . " American soldiers enjoyed the war . President Roosevelt " will keep this war running at least until the end of his fourth term . He knows that if the war stops , he loses his war powers and his jobs . " That Time writer may still be at the magazine today . As I say , on large matters Yardley 's Sage was almost always wrong . I think the best explanation for the cruelty of Mencken 's private thoughts , his bewilderment late in life , and his frequent misperception of his times is provided by Terry Teachout , the author of a 2002 biography , The Skeptic : A Life of H. L. Mencken . Mencken was incapable of perceiving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teachout , " had no feeling for the darkness in the heart of man . He looked at evil and saw ignorance . To him Hitler was Babbitt run amok .... " I agree with Yardley . I am no Mencken.
