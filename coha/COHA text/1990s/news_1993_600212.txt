<p> The collapse of the Iron Curtain a few years ago opened new possibilities for vacationers and , more recently , whole new countries , created from old some of which are making Herculean efforts to attract our attention . USA TODAY 's Gene Sloan consults the experts to spotlight three that are worth a visit . <p> Slovenia : Peaceful place to ski , visit spas <p> The breakup of Yugoslavia has added several countries to the map of Europe , but for now , only one seems reasonably safe for visitors : Slovenia . <p> The northernmost state of the old Yugoslavia it borders Italy , Austria and Hungary declared independence on June 25 , 1991 , the same day as its southern neighbor , Croatia . But unlike Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina , it avoided a knock-down fight over it . <p> " It 's been quite peaceful in Slovenia , actually , " says Rob Van Driesum , European editor for Lonely Planet guidebooks . " The fighting is quite a long distance from the Slovenian border and not likely to spill over . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chain in Austria and Italy , are its top draw with some of Europe 's best skiing in winter , and hiking and caving in summer . Rooms in the most popular mountain towns such as Bled and Bohinj range $ 35-$ 75 per person , per day . <p> " It 's basically got the same scenery as Austria , except skiing packages are about half the cost , " says Van Driesum . <p> Bled , where the summer home of former Yugoslavian dictator Tito is now the deluxe Vila Bled ( double , $ 125 ) , is on a lake and surrounded by mountains . Other towns popular with skiers and hikers include Kranika and Bovec . The town of Postojna has Europe 's largest caverns . <p> Another reason to visit : more than a dozen spa towns , with thermal waters and organic treatment centers . Best known : Rogaska Spa , 55 miles from Slovenia 's capital , Ljubljana . <p> Van Driesum suggests allowing a day to see Roman-built Ljubljana ( pop . 323,000 ) , with its castle , cathedral ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to Slovenia , U.S. visitors usually fly to Venice or Munich , then take the train . U.S. citizens only need a passport . <p> For tours , New York-based Slovenia Group ( the state travel bureau ) offers 10- to 15-day packages that include Ljubljana , the caves at Postojna and the Slovenian Alps ( example : 10 days , $ 570 per person , not including airfare ) . <p> For more information , call Slovenia Group , 212-421-0551 . <p> Lativa : Medieval preservation <p> Under Soviet rule , Latvia was mostly off-limits to vacationers . But since breaking away two years ago , the small Baltic republic has begun to draw crowds . <p> " It 's the most interesting of the three ( Baltic republics ) , " says Christopher Billy , senior editor for Fodor 's Travel Publications . " It has a medieval feeling , a rolling countryside with thick woods and miles of beach on the Baltic Sea . " <p> About the size of New Jersey , Latvia is sandwiched between two other breakaway republics , Estonia to the north and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riga ( pop . 916,500 ) , is by far its top tourist destination . The bustling port town dates to medieval times ( founded 1201 A.D. ) , with winding streets , ancient church spires and decorated buildings . <p> Important sites include Dom Cathedral , which dates to 1211 and has one of Europe 's largest organs , and the Ethnographic Open Air Museum , with restored farmsteads showing peasant life . " Everywhere there are well-preserved medieval monuments , beautiful parks . People also go there to shop for amber jewelry , pottery and linen , " Billy says . <p> Since tourism is just beginning , lodging options particularly if you 're looking for Western amenities are limited . Most visitors stay at one of four hotels in Riga : Hotel Riga ( renovated rooms , $ 180 ; non-renovated , $ 130 ) , Hotel Latvia ( renovated rooms , $ 175-$ 200 ; non-renovated , $ 105 ) , German-run Hotel de Rome ( $ 205 ) and Swedish-run Metropole ( $ 190 ) . <p> For the more adventurous , Riga and smaller towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 10 per person ) . <p> Remember : This is not Britain or France . So do n't drink the tap water . And bring your own shampoo , soap and other toiletries , as well as aspirin and other medicines . <p> While Latvia does not yet have a tourist office in the U.S. , the Latvian embassy recommends contacting New York-based Uniontours , a longtime organizer of trips for Latvian-Americans and anyone else who wants to go . <p> Other tour operators , such as New York-based General Tours , have Baltic packages that include Latvia with Estonia , Lithuania and Russia . <p> Vacationers who fly to Riga usually go on Lufthansa , through Frankfurt ; Finnair , through Helsinki ; or Scandanavian Airlines , through Copenhagen or Stockholm . Typical round-trip fare : $ 900 . <p> Rental cars , offered by Hertz and Avis at Riga 's airport , are expensive ( Volkswagen Golf , $ 90 per day , unlimited miles ) . <p> U.S. citizens need a visa to enter Latvia ( $ 10 , contact Latvian Embassy , 202-726-8213 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Czech Republic has attracted the touring masses for more than a year now , Slovakia the newly independent eastern part of what used to be Czechoslovakia remains relatively unknown . <p> Not for long , though , says Rob Van Driesum , editor of Lonely Planet 's European guidebooks , which are intended primarily for offbeat travelers . <p> " You can actually see the changes taking place . If you wait much longer , you 'll probably miss it , " he says . " In five years you 'll have tourist resorts , high-rise hotels , campgrounds and people streaming in it will kill the charm . " <p> Van Driesum concedes that the capital , Bratislava ( pop . 380,000 ) , with its seemingly endless blocks of Communist-built housing projects , is a bit of a letdown after Prague but it does have a historic Old Town with winding streets , a castle and the Church of the Holy Trinity , with fresco ceilings . <p> Lodging ranges from $ 60 to $ 70 a night in places , which Van Driesum admits might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to $ 169 a night for the comfy , new Austrian-built Danube hotel . <p> To really see Slovakia , rent a car . A favorite destination is Tatra National Park in the mountainous northern part of the country , near the Polish border . The park is a center for skiing , hiking , cable-car rides and caves , and has three established resort towns Stary Smokovec , Strbske Pleso and Tatranska Lomnica . Rooms go for as low as $ 15 , says Van Driesum . On the high end , the four-star , 83-room Grand Hotel in Stary Smokovecs is $ 96 per night , and buffet breakfast is included in the price . <p> In the less-traveled interior of the country , mostly farmland and forests , Van Driesum recommends unplanned wandering among the tiny peasant villages , where you 'll find inexpensive local inns every few miles . <p> " It 's a bit adventurous , " he says , " but ask the locals for places to stay and eat maybe they 'll invite you into their homes . " <p> For the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but be warned : " Unfortunately , a lot of ( Slovakians ) are ripping off foreigners , " says Richard Nebesky , also of Lonely Planet . A common trap : hotels and restaurants that regularly double bills , hoping to slip them by you . <p> If you 're looking for a package tour , the old Czechoslovakian Travel Bureau ( Cedok ) which still represents both countries has recently added an eight-day Slovakia tour . Travel to Bratislava , the Tatra Mountains and the historic towns of Bojnice , Levoca and Banska Bystrica ( $ 1,469-$ 1,625 , including airfare ) . <p> For more information , call Cedok , 800-800-8891.
