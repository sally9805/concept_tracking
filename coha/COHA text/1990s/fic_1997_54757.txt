The tall man with the gaunt skeleton hidden in his flesh stepped out of the elevator on the third floor of the hospital with a resolve in his face not to be deterred . Making his way to the night nurse 's desk he stood immensely quiet , cleaving the air with his resolution to make this query : <p> " Which of your patients has the greatest , richest , most incredible bank deposits ? " <p> The nurse glanced up at this strange request . <p> " Pardon ? " <p> " You heard me very clearly , " said the tall gaunt man . <p> " What a strange question . " <p> " Not strange when you think what 's at risk . " <p> " You sound like a lawyer . " <p> " Please , " said the tall man . " At this very moment on this floor are- " he shut his eyes to count behind his lids , " at least four people , three men , one woman , floating out of their beds toward limbo and beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " How can I be a relative when I do n't know the name of the richest patient here ? " <p> " Well , yes ... " The nurse hesitated , one hand on the patients ' listings . <p> " Give me that ! " And before she could move , he seized , poked it with a pale finger . " This one ? " he said . " Or this ? Or why not this ? " <p> When he saw her iris flex , his hand froze with his fingernail creasing a name at the bottom . " Ha ! " <p> " No , no ! " <p> " Why do you stare at this name , then ? Shall I read it out ? Jonathan Blake , age seventy-six , room 605 . Advanced hepatitis . Income ? " <p> The gaunt man reeled off some numbers . " Worth ten million ? Seventy ? Half a billion ? " <p> Again , her eyes darkened . <p> " My god , " said the gaunt man . " That much ? Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ca n't go in there ! " <p> " I 'm there ! " <p> No sooner in the room which had the premonitory silence of the mortuary , than the skeleton leaning forward in the gaunt man 's flesh leaned still further . <p> " Wake up ! " he cried . <p> The pale victim of some germ that would soon dissolve him out of existence flicked wide his eyes in shock . <p> " Sit up ! " was the second command . <p> The sick man , mostly bones and skin , convulsed as best he could , surprised yet again . <p> " Listen ! " came the third cry . <p> " Doctor ? " whispered the dying man . <p> " Perhaps , perhaps not , " said the gaunt visitor , speaking as through an invisible megaphone . " Answer this : Do you value your life at ten million , forty million , ninety million , which ? " <p> The same discoloring of the iris , as witnessed in the nurse , revealed the correct sum . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  --  " he consulted the patient 's chart , "  --  die . Yes ? " <p> " Nobody , " gasped the old man , " told me ! " <p> " So much for sickly sweet lying doctors . Some time before sunrise they will bag and mail you to Eternity Plus . That suit you ? " <p> " No , " gasped the old man , " it does n't suit me ! " <p> " I 'll change that . " The dark visitor tossed the chart on the bed . " I 'm here with an offering . Since you 'll be dead tomorrow , how would you like to live an extra week or ten days ? " <p> Stricken with this small but still good news , the skin-and-bones patient could only jerk his head in a nod and lisp out an affirmative . <p> " Good ! " The stranger reached to grasp the old man 's kindling wrist and pulse . " Slow , slower , slowest . Well ! " He dropped the wrist . " I am here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extra life . Not much . But when they 're shoving you under death 's door into night , that ten days is Eden 's sunlight , mother 's milk . Want the details ? " <p> The old man , stricken , jerked his head , eyes blazing with acceptance . <p> " The offer runs so : Sign over your complete bank accounts , including the Swiss , half a billon or so . All , all of it ! In return you wo n't have to sink into a rain-filled grave but will enjoy , hell , love , two hundred forty hours of fresh air and sunlight , breathing , eating , that precious stuff that melts in your mouth . It figures out at fifty thousand dollars per minute , I have no head for figures , a huge cache for every second , worth double , triple that , yes ? !

Are you the coward I think you are , fearful of gravediggers ' spades shuffling earth ? You will give me your bank , yes , to gain a few brand new children 's hours ? Mmmm ? " <p> The old man , lost in the pale tissues of his bed , looked at his visitor , then stared at the ceiling and beyond . <p> " Well ? " said the gaunt man , " your answer ? " <p> " No , " gasped the old man . <p> " What ? " <p> " No ! " It came in a stale gust from the dying man 's lips . And again , an outburst of will , " No ! " <p> The gaunt man fell back as from a storm above the bed . <p> " You refuse ? " <p> The sick man closed his eyes to read his obituary off his lids . <p> " I refuse , " he said . <p> ' I ca n't believe my ears ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Nobody has ever refused ! " <p> " More 's the pity . " <p> " Do you know what you 're saying ? " <p> " I know , I know . " <p> " This means absolute extinction in some few hours ! " <p> " But with dignity . " <p> " Death is not dignified ! " <p> " Being dead , I will not know , " whispered the old man . <p> " But do n't you feel the cold tomb , the turbulence of worms ? " <p> " I feel , I sense , I know , " said the old man behind his white mask . " But , I will not buy time , " whispered the old man . " I will take only what is given and given freely . " <p> " Well , then ! " The gaunt stranger pushed himself back with a barking laugh from the bed . <p> " Well , " whispered the old man , " then . " <p> " Do you know what you have done ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a few hours the night will come and stay , " murmured the old man . <p> " Do you know what you have done ? " repeated the visitor . <p> " If you insist , tell me . " <p> " Instead of seven or ten days , you have won two thousand , four thousand , six thousand extra days ! " <p> " What ? " the old man 's eyes flicked wide . <p> " By refusing to pay , you have won another lifetime . " <p> " It can not be ! " <p> " Is ! " <p> " How , what , why ? For God 's sake , who are you ? Peace , man , let me die in peace ! " <p> " No , I can not , I must not ! " <p> The old man fixed him with a stunned gaze . <p> " I thought you were Death . " <p> " Almost .

You are . Now . " <p> " Why are you doing this ? " <p> " Such bravery must have its reward . Here ! " He seized the old man 's hands which were immediately jump-started , leaping to escape the shocks from the gaunt man 's fingers . " I conjoin with you . We fuse . From two make one . I have searched for you for weeks , months , years . Hold ! This is my offering ! " <p> The old man cried out . His face burst like the sun . <p> Moments later , the night nurse glanced up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a glorious pink melon face , leaning over her desk , shouting into the light : <p> " Recall the tall stranger who was here ?

" Together ! It 's New Year 's Eve ! Go see ! " <p> The young man ran off down the hall , hands clapped to his mouth to seal his laughter . <p> After a moment the nurse moved to the door of the old man 's room and looked in . <p> " Gone , " she said . <p> <p> <p> By Ray Bradbury <p> Ray Bradbury has sold us a number of stories in the last few years .
