The professor and the middle class <p> Seven months ago Senator John Heinz - youthful , handsome , wealthy , and politically impregnable - left Washington in a small plane . The pilot , concerned about safety , wanted to ensure that the landing gear was in good working order . He radioed for a helicopter to fly up and inspect . Suddenly the copter veered into the hovering plane , and the aircraft descended in flames upon a suburban schoolyard . The senator and several children were killed . <p> Governor Bob Casey now had the chance to appoint the first Democratic senator from Pennsylvania in more than a generation . For nearly two months , however , he dithered and then failed to find a taker . Several promising state officials turned down the offer , fearing that they might lose the seat . Casey then laid the appointment at the feet of Lee lacocca . But the industrial statesman , believing himself above elective office , rejected the glittering prize as if it were a bent hubcap . Finally Casey settled on a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harris Wofford . The new senator had been an aide long ago to President Kennedy , an author of serious books , and the first male president of Bryn Mawr College . The 65-year-old liberal intellectual , given to bouts of high-flown rhetoric , seemed a superannuated choice . But he was distinguished enough not to embarrass Casey for the few short months he would serve as senator . <p> Down in Washington , the favorite son prepared for his triumphant return home . Dick Thornburgh , the attorney general , had been twice elected governor of Pennsylvania . He was a good government advocate , a former prosecutor from Pittsburgh , a crusader against crime and partisanship . Even many liberal Democrats found him an acceptable alternative to their party 's hacks . He was for gun control , pro-choice on abortion , against capital punishment , for legalizing prostitution , and a board member of the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union . After leaving the statehouse in Harrisburg he became the director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard 's Kennedy School , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the disaster left at the Justice Department by Edwin Meese . Once again Thornburgh was in his familiar role as the man beyond interests , ideology , and politics itself . <p> But over the Reagan years he had gradually transformed himself . One by one he threw overboard his previous positions . Now , in line with the conservative orthodoxy , he was anti-abortion , against gun control , and for capital punishment . In his confirmation hearings he said that he regretted having proclaimed " Gay Pride Week " in 1979 . During the 1988 campaign he stepped forward as a surrogate for George Bush to lambaste Michael Dukakis for belonging to that organization of lily-livered liberals - the ACLU - without ever acknowledging his own erstwhile association . Like Bush , Thornburgh willingly exchanged principles for power . By this alchemy , Thornburgh became one of the few true Bush Republicans . <p> It all appeared to be working . Walking down the steps of the Justice Department , facing a group of reporters eager for a statement , he burst into song : " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gulf war future Republican victories seemed assured . In Philadelphia Thornburgh saluted an autographed picture of the commander-in-chief . " See you soon in Washington , " he said , smiling toward the cameras . He was 44 points ahead of his opponent . Fewer than 15 percent of the voters even knew who Harris Wofford was . <p> The former governor had come back to Pennsylvania as if he were its anointed redeemer . Had n't he brought pride to the commonwealth by having the Harvard imprimatur stamped on his virtue and by playing on the national stage ? " I know the corridors of power in our nation 's capital from my three years as a member of the president 's Cabinet , " he said . " Washington , D.C. , my friends , is no place for on-the-job training . " Power was his rationale . " Some folks have asked me why I 'm running for the U.S. Senate , " Thornburgh explained in an early ad . " It 's simple . I love this state . " He believed that the converse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank goodness for Dick Thornburgh . " The suggestion that Pennsylvania ought to be grateful for his condescension was articulated by his campaign manager , Michele Davis , in one of those gaffes that reveal the truth . " Dick Thornburgh , " said the Michigan native , " is the salvation of this sorry-assed state . " Of course she apologized instantly . <p> But Wofford was paying attention . " That was the first time I thought that there are openings here , " he told me . " Everyone focused on the ' sorry-assed state ' part . But the worst of it was ' the salvation ' - that you would think of politicians as saviors . " ( Wofford 's remark has an edge to it that is not readily apparent . He is a recent convert to Catholicism . ) " He is absolutely ideal , " Wofford said . " He 's so satisfied , so typical of the establishment , so inert , so focused on being in power rather than using power . " Thornburgh did not expect real opposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His instinct was to dismiss him as a non-entity barely worthy of notice . " Well , " said Wofford , " it 's a pleasure to give him a hot race . " <p> Thornburgh expected that the campaign would be a gigantic homecorning parade , with himself as the hero . But the confetti-strewn spring gave way to a glum autumn . Thornburgh brought up the Gulf war once and never mentioned it again . The voters were obsessed with the faltering economy . Pennsylvania had been long suffering a decline of its industrial base . Now , hit by the recession , its unemployment rate jumped . The changed economic conditions and Bush 's indifferent response radically shifted the terms of the campaign . <p> Suddenly Wofford stepped forward as something other than the absent-minded professor , the soft liberal . " People have always had a hard time getting the right fix on me , " he said . " My rhetoric is romantic . I like the high promises . " But his own past provided him with unusual resources upon which to draw . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student of Gandhi , friend of Martin Luther King Jr. , aide to JFK , White House liaison to the civil rights movement , co-founder of the Peace Corps . Wofford 's book on the 1960s , Of Kennedys and Kings , published in 1980 , disdains the Camelot incarnation of the Kennedy administration and holds up for close inspection the flawed , incomplete reality . ' John Kennedy , Robert Kennedy , Martin Luther King were my peers , not my heroes , " he said . " They were n't my mentors , but they showed me what could be done . " <p> Wofford presented the extraordinary spectacle of a liberal intellectual willing to do what 's necessary to win an election . He took a crash course in how to become a candidate . His chief instructor was James Carville , the Ragin ' Cajun from Louisiana , possessed of keen campaign insight and visceral class emotion . Carville does n't just prescribe populism - he vibrates with it . Wofford neither second-guessed his advisers nor submerged himself . What he learned above all , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message . " He was naturally diffuse and digressive . But with a bit of prodding , he stuck to the themes . His blasts helped prevent his image from being that of a liberal martyr , too good for this world . Even in his aggression , his manner was charming , especially in contrast to Thornburgh 's . He seemed to delight in campaigning . " I 've been hitting them too hard to come across as a saint , " he said gleefully . <p> The potential for a Democrat was not far beneath the surface . The state is nearly evenly split in party identification , but the Democrats have a slight edge . It has the oldest population of any state except Florida . Michael Dukakis lost here by only two points . Wofford , moreover , was not the machine pol whom Thornburgh expected and against whom he could run as the good-government type . Wofford had an appeal in the suburbs that cut directly into the GOP vote . But the main factor in his favor was the sense that the Republicans had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Wofford picked up on Thornburgh 's conceit about being a Washington insider and turned it on him . At every opportunity , Wofford ridiculed his boasting about " the corridors of power . " " He 's been in Washington too long , " said Wofford ads about Thornburgh . In fact , he had only been in Washington three years , but it was Thornburgh who had initially tried to make his experience sound like an eternity of wisdom . " It 's time to take care of our own , " said Wofford from every platform . The ambiguity of the statement cut deeply . It meant that Wofford was not just for the poor , but for the economically pressed middle class as well . It meant that Thornburgh , like Bush , the foreign policy president , was indifferent to their concerns . And it meant that Wofford was not like Democrats of the recent past who seemed to have lost a sense of what being a Democrat was all about . Here Wofford 's identification with the practical energy of JFK was crucial . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To prove that he would " take care of our own , " he was for national health insurance - an issue that appealed to a broad constituency consumed with social insecurity , aggravated by the recession . " If criminals have a right to a lawyer , " he said , " working Americans have a right to a doctor . " Thus he directed anger downward and upward in one combustible phrase . <p> When Thornburgh strode onto the stage , this theater of populism turned into something like the screwball , Capraesque populism of the 1930s . Thornburgh cast himself as a wholly satisfactory villain , not quite evil , just pompous , begging for a comeuppance . The humor derived from his lack of self-awareness . As he campaigned in Erie , a woman in a crowd complained about her economic difficulties . " Things are rough all over , " Thornburgh replied testily . When questioned about health insurance , he said : " I do n't have a plan at this time . " He went on to relate his idea of public debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cook up some instant solution to terribly involved public policy questions . That 's a mistake my opponent is making . " <p> He agreed to meet Wofford for one discussion of issues at which he expected to encounter nothing but deference . Wofford , however , hammered him about " his administration in Washington . " " Why do n't you elect a president ? " Thornburgh snapped . Afterward , he complained that Wofford has " somehow been coached into the notion he has to snarl and fight and attack my character in this campaign . " But Wofford had not attacked his character . He had raised issues that Thornburgh had not wanted to discuss . And Thornburgh sneeringly called him " Wooford , " which only made Thornburgh the unsympathetic one . <p> Thornburgh was the first to launch negative television spots . It was not simply that he was against his opponent 's ideas ; he had none of his own , and none from the Bush administration even to defend . His campaign devolved into an effort to destroy the messenger so that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take money from BCCI ? " went Thornburgh 's ad . " Harris Wofford . " As it happened , Wofford 's campaign had accepted a contribution from Paul Warnke , who had been President Carter 's chief arms control negotiator and was the law partner of Clark Clifford . Although Clifford was accused of involvement in the BCCI scandal , Warnke was not . In fact , he had broken up the firm by leaving . <p> " What kind of man would take money from him ? " said the voice-over . Adnan Khashoggi , the shady Saudi financier involved in the Iran-contra scandal appeared on the screen . Khashoggi had offered funding to a consortium of colleges fourteen years earlier to create departments of Middle Eastern studies . After consultations with the trustees and faculty at Bryn Mawr , Wofford turned down Khashoggi 's offer and made a counter-offer : Bryn Mawr would accept scholarships for two Arab women . <p> " This is an ad from another planet , " editorialized The Philadelphia Inquirer . Across the state , newspapers began unloading contempt on Thornburgh 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had supported him in every previous campaign , abandoned him . As the race became tight Thornburgh 's handlers reasoned that anything that could pull Wofford down even slightly might be enough . But Thornburgh 's tortured attempt to destroy Wofford by depicting him as a crook was easily deflected by facts . And this sort of relentless negativity had the effect of blotting out any positive effort . It became absurd when he tried to play racial politics against Wofford - the first white man to attend Howard University Law School , and whom King had dubbed a " legitimate Negro " - by attacking his vote against Clarence Thomas 's confirmation . <p> Wofford then made Thornburgh 's escape into his record impossible . The master of Washington was pummeled for his conduct as attorney general . Two of Thornburgh 's aides had failed polygraph tests about leaking unfounded rumors about then-Representative William Gray , the House majority whip , a potential rival in Pennsylvania politics . Another aide was convicted of cocaine use . The list of particulars went on : he has frustrated prosecution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case and the Neil Bush case ; he got a White House waiver of conflict-of-interest rules so that he could negotiate the Exxon Valdez oil spill , though he had investments in two oil companies . So much for the good-government champion . <p> With a week to go , a bewildered Thornburgh announced that he might have a health care plan . It was the one that the Bush administration was trying to formulate . And it had the " option " of taxing health care benefits . Ooops ! No , said Thornburgh , he had not said that . He was misquoted . But the reporter for The Pittsburgh Press had it all on tape , and Thornburgh 's slip was dominating day after day of the news in a kind of continuous feedback loop . In the final days Republican pollsters gulled the national press into printing stories that the gap was closing , though in fact it was widening . <p> On the golf course President Bush told the press that he would " stay away or go " to Pennsylvania , " whatever he wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the election , Thornburgh offered to all the local television stations satellite interviews from Washington with Vice President Dan Quayle . The same day an old alumna of Bryn Mawr , angry about Thornburgh 's negative advertising , endorsed Wofford . With this , he won the heroine of the Capra movie : Katharine Hepburn . Quayle was overshadowed by the co-star of State of the Union . Mr. Vice President , you 're no Spencer Tracy . On November 5 Thornburgh 's hemorrhaging stopped at last . He lost 56 percent to 44 percent . His vote was the exact percentage he had , only a few months earlier in another era , been ahead . <p> Dick Thornburgh , who came to Washington harboring presidential ambition , may now return to Pittsburgh , where as a distinguished former , addressed by one and all as " Governor , " he may haunt the comfortable upstairs rooms of the exclusive Duquesne Club . At the White House , in the meantime , campaign consultants trailing streams of poll numbers rush in and out of panicky meetings . George Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day , will spend the time uncharacteristically immobile . Something is gnawing inside the walls . <p> By Sidney Blumenthal <p>
