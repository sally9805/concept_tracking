Do n't worry . That peculiar odor you have been noticing in the morning is not burning toast . It is the smell of panic  --  plump and juicy egos sizzling on a very hot griddle  --  at NBC 's Today show . Since the end of December , when Deborah Norville replaced Jane Pauley as co-host , ratings have not merely dropped ; they have gone into free fall , a dizzying decline of nearly 25% that translates into approximately 920,000 lost households . The No. 1 morning program only five months ago , Today is now a distant No. 2 , far behind ABC 's Good Morning America . <P> Rarely has a show fallen so far so fast , and last week the network scrambled to repair it . Out went Dick Ebersol , senior executive in charge of the show , who had picked Norville and who graciously , if inescapably , took the blame for the decline that followed . ( Ebersol remains head of NBC Sports . ) On June 4 , in will come a third host , the amiable Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was one of the show 's stalwarts from 1969 to 1973 . " It 's incredible that I could come back , " says Garagiola , 64 , who was dropped as NBC 's weekend baseball commentator in 1988 and who seemed as astonished as everyone else that the network would now choose him to save Today . " It 's quite flattering . I 'm not a flat-belly , perfect-teeth kind of guy . " In too will come Faith Daniels from CBS This Morning , who will become Today 's news anchor . <P> But Bryant Gumbel , 41 , whose self-satisfied manner many find as off-putting as Norville 's plastic perfection , will remain . So will Norville , 31 , who has been officially exonerated for the ratings calamity . " She 's not on the way out , " insists Today 's executive producer , Tom Capra . " The ratings have slid because Jane left the show , not because of Deborah . Deborah 's a solid journalist , and I believe the audience will like her as they are exposed to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is really going on with her . " So it seems that one host has been hired to persuade viewers to cozy up to another . <P> " They 're trying to repair the problem by coming at the wrong end , " says Joel Segal , an executive vice president of the ad agency McCann-Erickson . " I do n't see how bringing in a third person will help bring up the first two . " <P> There have been signs of trouble at Today since early 1989 , when someone leaked a memo in which Gumbel attacked almost all his colleagues except Pauley . After that , it was hard to maintain the fiction that the Today crew was a happy family , and analysts began to note that while Today was first in the ratings , Good Morning America was stealing the young female audience most prized by advertisers . Pauley 's awkwardly handled departure  --  it looked to many as if she had been supplanted by the younger Norville  --  turned a problem into a catastrophe . <P> No one , particularly no one at NBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is a fellow in Florida who saved the show from a ratings disaster once , in 1953 , and he is willing to try again . Like Garagiola , he is not a flat-belly , perfect-teeth kind of guy ; but , at 38 , J. Fred Muggs , the world 's most famous chimpanzee , remains a crowd pleaser . " People like him because he 's unpredictable and natural , " says his trainer , Bud Mennella . " That show needs a spark , and Muggs has it . " One thing is for certain : he could n't hurt . <P> CHART : NOT AVAILABLE <P> CREDIT : TIME Chart
