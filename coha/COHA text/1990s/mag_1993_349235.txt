Even before Andrew Gobea was born , doctors knew his future would be clouded . Prenatal tests showed he had inherited a set of defective genes that would % leave him defenseless against infections . Had he been born 10 years earlier , he could have survived only in a sterile environment , as did David , the famous " Bubble Boy , " who died after 12 years inside a sealed plastic enclosure . Andrew , however , has a chance to lead a normal life . In a new test of gene therapy , doctors at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles , using blood extracted from his umbilical cord moments after he was born , separated out some white cells and inserted a new gene into them . The altered cells were injected into Andrew 's body four days later in what could become part of a remarkable medical milestone : the first attempts to cure a disease by gene therapy . <P> Andrew was one of three youngsters with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency treated with the new technique in the past two weeks . Doctors at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical to Andrew 's on Zachary Riggins , a three-day-old infant . And at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Maryland , an 11-year-old girl underwent a similar procedure . These three cases mark an important new phase in the rapidly expanding field of gene therapy . Earlier experiments involved inserting beneficial genes only to treat disease , not to cure it . <P> The new work is based on the landmark experiment performed in 1990 by NIH Drs . W. French Anderson , Michael Blaese and Kenneth Culver on two Ohio girls , ages 4 and 9 . Neither child was producing ADA , an enzyme that rids the bloodstream of harmful metabolic products . The absence of ADA can cause SCID by allowing toxic substances to accumulate and destroy immune-system cells . Both children had been kept alive by weekly injections of PEG-ADA , a costly synthetic enzyme , but neither was in good health . <P> In the first approved gene-therapy trials , the pioneering NIH team extracted immune-system T cells from the Ohio girls , inserted normal ada genes into the cells and reinjected them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began churning out natural ADA , enabling the children 's immune systems to function effectively . While that result marked the first successful treatment by gene therapy , it was not a cure ; the altered T cells die out after several months , and the little patients must return to the NIH periodically to repeat the procedure . <P> Seeking a cure , researchers have now focused on so-called stem cells  --  long-lasting cells that continually give rise to fresh blood cells . If ADA genes could be inserted into the parent stem cells , the scientists reasoned , the genes would be passed on to all newly formed immune cells , including T cells , and the patient would be ensured a permanent supply of the enzyme . But stem cells are rare , and most of them reside in the bone marrow . <P> In his latest experiment at the NIH , Blaese administered a drug to one of his two original Ohio patients that coaxed some stem cells out of the bone marrow and into her bloodstream . Extracting blood , he painstakingly separated out the rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and injected the cells back into the girl 's bloodstream , hoping that they would migrate back to the marrow and take up permanent residence .
