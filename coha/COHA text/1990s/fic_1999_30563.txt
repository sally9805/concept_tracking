Chapter 5 Salem woke up shouting , " Troops ! Advance on the enemy ! Attack ! " He had been dreaming again about taking over the mortal realm . It was a wonderful dream . This time he won the war and was just about to be crowned King of Every Single Thing when he suddenly woke up . Smiling to himself , he stretched . Then he opened his eyes . He blinked in surprise . He was in another wire cage ! It was just like the one he had been locked into inside the van . It was one of several placed in a row , with more cages stacked on top . It was kind of like a cage apartment building . What a horrible invention , he thought , shuddering . Beyond the gate to his cage was a spotless , dark gray concrete floor . About five feet away another row of cages faced his . Several of the cages contained dogs , including a large black-and-white Dalmatian that stared curiously at Salem . Another cage held a big-eyed raccoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other on the other side of the Dalmatian . Beside the row of cages , in a bird cage on a pedestal , a brilliantly colored parrot squawked , " Troops ! Attack ! Awk ! " Salem frowned , then said , " Where am I ? " " We 're in prison , " Antonio said unhappily . He sat in the cage on Salem 's right . His hind leg was wrapped in bandages . " They brought us in while you were still asleep . " " Asleep ! " Salem cried . " I was not ... okay , I did fall asleep , " he admitted . " I 'm not used to so much physical activity . What did they do to you ? " He gestured at Antonio 's bandages . " I scraped my leg when you knocked me out of the way , " Antonio said . " Not that I am blaming you , of course . You saved my life . " " Yes . " And I never gettired of being thanked for things like that , Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Antonio said , his eyes going soft and dreamy . " His name is Howard . He 's nice , for a jailer . " " Well , I 'm glad this Howard looked after you . " Salem frowned . " But he must have noticed that I 'm a cat . Why 'd he lock me up ? " " He decided you must be a house cat , " Antonio explained . " He thought it would be cruel to let you out . " " Cruel ? " Salem was confused . " How can giving me my freedom be cruel ? " " He said you looked like you were lost , " Antonio told him . " He was afraid you would n't make it back home in one piece . " Antonio lowered his voice . " He said it 's a jungle out there , my friend . " " Well , it is . But not the kind of jungle we fought in during our quest for world domination , " Salem said , sighing . " That one was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars and Doberman pinschers . " He looked around . " In the movies the prisoners always get to make one phone call . I 'll just phone Sabrina and ask her to come get us . " " No phone calls for us , amigo , " Antonio reminded him . " We 're animals , remember ? " Salem flopped over on his side . " Oh , this is just great , " he grumbled . " The reunion begins tomorrow . I have a thousand things to do to prepare for it , and I 'm stuck in the slammer ! " " It 's always hard for the new ones , " said the dog across from Salem . He was a tall and muscular Dalmatian , white with lots of black spots all over his body . One of his eyes was surrounded by black , while the fur around the other one was white . " Welcome to the dog pound , " he said . " It 's really not so bad . Unless you 're used to something better . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're talking . " " It 's very strange , " the dog mused . " Suddenly we can all talk . " " We can all talk ! " the parrot chirped . The Dalmatian grinned at Salem . " Well , Polly just repeats everything we say . But she 's always been able to do that . " " When did this happen ? " Salem asked . " Earlier today , " the Dalmatian told him . " A few hours before they brought you two in . " " Salem , " Antonio said quietly , " it must be from when Emilio cast the ' talking animal ' spell . " " I think it 's fabuloso , " said a sultry voice . Salem craned his neck to see through the mesh into the cage on the other side of Antonio . It was another Chihuahua . Only this one wore a sparkly jeweled collar adorned with a pastel pink bow . And from the look on Antonio 's face , she was a lovely girl , for a dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Salem . " We had a long chat while you were asleep . She used to be a TV star ! " " Commercials , " she drawled . " Fast food , mostly . I even had my own T-shirts . " She sighed , rose , and scratched herself . She continued , " I tried to move into films , but it did n't work out . I decided to spend some time away from Hollywood , so I came to the East Coast . And now I 'm stuck in this fleabag joint ! " " We 'll get you out , " Antonio said . " Wo n't we , my fearless leader ? " All eyes turned toward Salem . Uh-oh ! Salem was about to answer when footsteps rang on the floor . The other animals got to their paws or claws and arched their necks in the direction of a large closed door to Salem 's right . " It 's Howard , " the Dalmatian announced . " He 's bringing our dinner . " " Awk ! Polly want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape as soon as possible . Right , Salem ? " Antonio said urgently . Salem 's mouth began to water . Dinner ! How wonderful . He was starving . " Sure , Antonio . Right after we eat , " he promised . After all , he reasoned , fearless leaders hatch better escape plans after a nice , big meal . Or else they fall asleep , he added . Howard the keeper was just about to open the door . " Okay , listen up and listen good , " Salem said to the others . " Do not talk around humans . You 'll get into more trouble than you can imagine . " " It sounds as if you 've learned that lesson the hard way , " the Dalmatian said . " Believe me , I have . " Salem rolled his eyes . The stories I could tell this group ! " Me , too , " Antonio said . " The stories I could tell you ! " " All right , then . " The Dalmatian nodded . " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okeydokey , " the raccoon piped . " Yessiree , Bob ! " a Pekingese joined in . " Mum 's the word ! " a third voice chirruped . Before Salem could hush them , all the animals were very noisily agreeing to be quiet . But everyone fell silent as soon as the door opened . Howard was a young man about six feet tall , wearing a sweatshirt that read BOSTON COLLEGE and a pair of well-worn jeans . He was pushing an aluminum cart containing several metal bowls with one hand and holding a thick book with the other . He was reading the book intently . Salem sniffed the air expectantly and murmured , " Tuna . It 's what 's for dinner . Oh , please , please , please . " The man put down his book and picked up a dish of food . He went to the first cage on the row facing Salem and bent down . " Evening , Delilah , " the man said to the Pekingese inside the first cage as he carefully opened the gate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened her mouth , glanced at Salem , and said , " Woof . " Then she dived into the bowl and started gobbling . Hmm . So at least they feed the prisoners well around here , Salem thought eagerly . " And here 's yours , Fireplug , " he said to the Dalmatian . The man put dishes down inside all the cages on the bottom row . There was dog food for the dogs , some fruit for the raccoon , and rabbit food for the ferrets . The parrot received birdseed . But when the man got to Salem 's cage , he frowned and said , " I 'm sorry , Mr. Kitty , but we do n't have any cat food today . I can give you dog food , though . " He smiled kindly . " How would you like that ? " Yuck ! Salem thought . He hunkered down and put his chin on his front paws . " Why do n't you try it ? " Howard asked as he opened Salem 's cage .
