If you 've heard the hypemeisters billing the U.S. Olympic basketball team as " the world 's greatest pickup squad , " it may have occurred to you that so fabulously wealthy and slickly marketed a group does n't exactly capture the true essence of the term pickup . But there is a team that fits the description , a Dream Team born of nobler reveries. // Lithuanians spent 51 years longing to gain their independence from the Soviet Union . During the final decade of the occupation , Lithuania provided the U.S.S.R. 's world and Olympic championship basketball teams with some of their best players . Thus many Lithuanians fixed upon a new , fond desire when their country gained its freedom 11 months ago : playing and beating their nemesis in the sport that residents of the Baltic republics have long regarded with Hoosierlike devotion . Their wish came true last week at the European Olympic qualifying tournament in the Spanish city of Badajoz , and it mattered little that the team Lithuania routed 116-79 represented something called the Commonwealth of Independent States , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all is the result of dogged wintertime phoning , faxing and lobbying by Golden State Warrior guard Sarunas Marciulionis and Arvidas Sabonis , a 7 ' 4 " center who plays professionally in Spain . " Having to both organize and play ball is twice as much work , " says Marciulionis , who was born and raised in Kaunas . " But it 's fun . And there 's twice as much satisfaction in each victory . " // The Lithuanians ' sponsors are a polyglot and improvised lot . The most numerous are Lithuanian-Americans , chesty about independence and delighted to support the cause . The most lavish underwriter is the resort town of Melilla , a Spanish possession on Morocco 's Mediterranean coast , which paid $200,000 in exchange for the team 's agreement to play an exhibition game and hold a camp there and to wear the resort 's name on the front of its uniforms . But the most off-the-wall support came from the Bay Area-based Grateful Dead , who kicked in $5,000 plus a set of tie-dyed warmups done up in Lithuania 's national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hair . // For a matchup so fraught with possible conflict , the game between Lithuania and the CIS was a remarkably decorous and festive one . Two minutes into the action , Valeri Tikhonenko of the CIS and Lithuania 's Gintaras Krapikas collided in pursuit of a loose ball ; when they hurried to their feet , each trying to be first to offer a handshake , the flout-the-fire-code crowd of 6,400 roared its approval . Soon Lithuania , which should have no problem gaining one of the four berths at stake in Zaragoza , site of the European finals that will be played this weekend , was demonstrating how perfectly woven together its ragtag team is . Sabonis has Mark Eaton 's strength , Bill Laimbeer 's outside shot and something close to David Robinson 's agility . With his first step Marciulionis can break down even a vacuum-packed zone . When Sabonis gets the ball inside or Marciulionis gets inside with the ball , the other three Lithuanians on the floor can knock down three-pointers as if the game were Around-the-World. // When the lead over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Lithuanian reserves joined the crowd in the wave . They probably should have been in the game , but with no TV broadcast of the game back home and few spectators from Lithuania on hand , the most significant game in the country 's history would be reduced to a simple score read in the paper or heard on a newscast . Thus the final margin had to be emphatic enough to satisfy Lithuanians whose ancestors had disappeared in the gulags or died with the resistance . Sabonis , for example , did n't take a seat until 49 seconds remained , by which time he had abused Tikhonenko and Atlanta Hawk forward Alexander Volkov , his former teammates on the Soviet Union 's 1988 gold medal team , for 33 points and 17 rebounds. // " It 's a funny situation , " said Marciulionis , who freely swapped NBA tales with his former U.S.S.R. teammates . " We have to remember other people in Lithuania who got hurt by politics . But no politics can step between people who 've spent five or six of our best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians , Ukrainians or Khazaks , they 're still my friends . You ca n't fight your friends .
