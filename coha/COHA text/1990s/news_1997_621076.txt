<p> Stanton Glantz is a scientist out of central casting . Unruly gray hair , glasses , neglected teeth , short-sleeve shirt with the requisite frayed collar and pen in the front pocket . He owns a 1969 Dodge Dart convertible but rides a 10-speed bike to the 11th- floor office he has occupied at the University of California at San Francisco for 20 years . It 's a cramped bandbox of a place whose one luxury is an old electric tea kettle on the floor . <p> At lunch , the medical professor slurps the last drops of iced tea , eats even the parsley and orange-wedge garnishes on his plate , then chews bits of the wrapper from his straw , committing himself 100 percent to the meal . It 's a defining trait , this complete passion for whatever he undertakes , one that helps explain why America 's tobacco lords hate and fear this rumpled scholar . <p> Glantz 's studies about the dangers of cigarette smoke  --  and his zeal for sharing his findings in the media  --  have cost the tobacco industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cigarette companies have retaliated with terse rebuttals and occasional subpoenas to his research as it appeared in medical journals . <p> But in the past five months , the stakes have gone up . As the tobacco companies strike a contrite pose in negotiating a multibillion-dollar federal settlement for damages caused by cigarettes , they have declared all-out war on Glantz . <p> " Philip Morris is running a jihad against me , " Glantz said . <p> This spring , a Web page went up devoted , in part , to discrediting him and his work . A state organization  --  Californians for Scientific Integrity  --  was formed in May to sue the university , contending that Glantz fraudulently used taxpayer money to fund studies they say supported his own political agenda . Tobacco industry lawyers have been securing restraining or ders , requesting subpoenas , taking depositions and filing suits alleging misdeeds dating back 15 years . The tobacco companies want to copy every sheet of paper in Glantz 's office and every disk on his computer . Last month , they got a temporary restraining order preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was lifted after a couple of weeks . ) <p> HISTORY OF STIRRING THINGS UP <p> He never minded the nasty remarks the tobacco people made about him . In fact , he thrived on battling them . Glantz has always loved standing in the center of the storm . In graduate school , for example , he and several other students published a paper in Science magazine revealing the Stanford science community 's ties to the military , sending the administration and the dean of engineering ballistic . He is so argumentative and arrogant in his views sometimes that he infuriates even his allies . <p> " What drives you crazy is he 's almost always right , " said Robin Hobart , co-director of Americans for Non-Smokers ' Rights . <p> THIS TIME IT 'S PERSONAL <p> But this storm is different . This one , he says , has become personal , so much so that Glantz recently took out an extra insurance policy on his home in case the tobacco companies sue him for libel and win . <p> " The goal is to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Glantz said . " They want to convince me not to do this anymore . And to convince the university to tell me , ' Look , this is costing us too much in legal fees , blah , blah , blah . ' I 'm fortunate that the university is supporting me the way they are . " <p> ' OVERESTIMATING HIS EFFECT ' <p> Walker Merryman of the Tobacco Institute , the trade association for the industry , is a longtime critic of Glantz but says no one is out to get the professor . He says Glantz is overestimating his effect . <p> " I do n't see anything he 's done that you can consider an accomplishment as far as smoking goes , " he said . " He 's simply very good at attracting attention to his views . Over the years , he has claimed to be an expert in every scientific field from economics to physiology . He calls himself ' doctor ' as if he 's a medical doctor when he 's really a mechanical engineer . He enjoys the image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disarray , wearing a cardigan sweater . I do n't think that 's by accident . I think that 's part of the act . " <p> Although Glantz is not a medical doctor , he is a full medical professor at the university . He has a doctorate in applied mechanical engineering , having completed his dissertation on how the heart muscle works . <p> SEMINAL ROLE IN MOVEMENT <p> Glantz 's supporters laugh at the comments . " His role is seminal in the movement , " said Hobart of the nonsmokers ' group . " It would be hard to picture where the clean- air movement would be without Stan Glantz 's research . " <p> Hobart and others say the reasons for the attacks are clear . " He 's costing them money , " she said . <p> Three years ago , Glantz did a study that showed restaurants did not suffer economically when forced to ban smoking in their dining rooms . That study is at the heart of the current attack . Public officials around the country have used the study to support passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Glantz " cooked " the results . This spring , they came out with a critique of Glantz 's work , saying he used fallacious data . Glantz , they say , is guilty not only of scientific misconduct but of misuse of government funds . <p> " It 's a completely bogus study , " said Gary Auxier of the National Smokers Alliance , which is spearheading the legal maneuverings against Glantz . " We might be looking at the tip of the iceberg here . No matter how you feel about smoking , you have to ask , ' Are there limits to what a university professor can do with taxpayer money ? ' If he 's been using it to go after his own political agenda , then something should be done about it . " <p> ' HIS RESEARCH IS IMPECCABLE ' <p> Such talk outrages Drummond Rennie , West Coast editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association and a medical professor at the university . <p> " For them  --  the masters of hiding data and misleading the public  --  to attack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upside-down , so hall of mirrors , it 's difficult to know what to say , " he said . " If you want to kill a scientist , you bring allegations of misconduct . Look , I 've critiqued Stan Glantz 's work very closely . I 've had reviewers pick his data apart . His research is impeccable . There is not a more honest and open scientist than Stan Glantz . <p> " What 's happening is nauseating . They want to finish this guy off . And with the money they have to throw around , they may very well succeed . They 're attacking this very honest , ingenious scientist because he 's right , not because he 's wrong . When you 're right , you 're a threat . " <p> NATIONWIDE ATTENTION <p> Glantz had also angered the tobacco industry when he and four colleagues published " The Cigarette Papers , " a 1995 book that included leaked files from Brown &; Williamson , the nation 's third-largest cigarette manufacturer . The files contained the first hard evidence that the tobacco industry knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The book landed Glantz appearances on " 60 Minutes , " " Nightline , " " Phil Donahue , " " Frontline " and the ABC News . <p> Now Glantz is making waves again by opposing the settlement that cigarette manufacturers are trying to hammer out in Washington  --  a settlement supported by the American Cancer Society and many other anti-smoking organizations . The settlement would release the tobacco industry from legal liability for the death and disease their products have caused in exchange for a huge fine and , among other concessions , more severe limits in advertising , particularly to children . <p> Glantz says the American Cancer Society and others " are being sold a bill of goods . " He 'd like the courts , not the government , to punish the cigarette manufacturers . Successful civil suits against them  --  either from individuals or from entire states suing for recovery of Medicaid costs  --  would prove to be so outrageously expensive for the companies that eventually the legal liability of selling cigarettes would outweigh the profit . The companies would go out of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stop all the suits , " Glantz said . " And in a short time it will become evident that the people got screwed . " <p> LOVING THE CONTROVERSY <p> As much as he resents what the tobacco companies are doing to him , he loves it , too . For one , the controversy revives his 3-year-old restaurant study , exposing it to public officials who might not have known about it . And it gives him a fresh forum to spread the word about smoking . The legal wranglings are taking time away from his other research  --  he 's been studying the mechanics of the left ventricle for more than 20 years in the hopes of better understanding heart disease  --  but he has no regrets . <p> " It 's worth doing because it makes a difference , " he said . " It makes life a lot better for a lot of people . I was a Boy Scout , an Eagle Scout . I believe in the idea of service . It 's part of the ethos at UC , which is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco industry tries to paint me as a fanatic . But I think I 'm just sensible . If you know someone is putting poison chemicals in the air , you have an ethical obligation to tell people . That 's what I 'm doing . " <p> CORRECTION-DATE : AUGUST 21 , 1997 , THURSDAY , FINAL EDITION <p> CORRECTION : Contrary to the characterization in an article yesterday about tobacco foe Stanton Glantz , the American Cancer Society does not support the proposed tobacco settlement in its present form . A society spokeswoman said the organization is recommending changes to seven major areas of the settlement , including a higher tax on cigarettes and release of all tobacco industry documents .
