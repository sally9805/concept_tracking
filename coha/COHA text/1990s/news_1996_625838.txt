<p> Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole continues to run neck-and-neck with U.S.Sen . Phil Gramm in Texas for the Republican presidential nomination , according to a Houston Chronicle/Dallas Morning News poll . <p> Gramm , a Texas senator since 1985 , is counting on a home state victory in the March 12 primary to boost his standing in the competition for the White House . <p> But Dole of Kansas and Gramm each garnered the support of 36 percent of 417 voters across the state who said they will vote in the Republican primary . The poll , conducted Jan. 2-7 , has a margin of error of 5.5 percentage points . <p> Only 11 percent of the Republican voters said they were unsure who they will support for the nomination two months from now . <p> All other GOP candidates mustered less than 7 percent each . <p> When paired separately against President Clinton , both Dole and Gramm were favored by a plurality of Texas voters . Clinton lost Texas in 1992 , and the poll shows that the state would be difficult for the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gramm 's performance as senator , the poll indicated , but in the GOP primary " " that does n't necessarily mean they are thrilled with him as president , " said Micheline Blum of Blum &; Weprin Associates Inc. , a New York firm which conducted the poll . <p> " " In most states , if there was a home-state candidate , he 'd being doing better , " Blum said . " " The fact that ( Gramm ) is sort of dead-even with Dole perhaps points to some weakness . " <p> Gramm 's own national pollster and consultant , Linda DiVall , said the survey shows that Dole has been unable to make any headway against Gramm in Texas " " despite being on the news every night and working hand in hand with the speaker ( House leader Newt Gingrich ) on the budget deal . " <p> Six months ago , a poll conducted by the University of Texas for Harte-Hanks Communications showed Dole and Gramm tied among Texas GOP voters with 43 percent each . <p> Gramm 's pollster asserted that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Republican voters have developed more qualms about whether Dole is compromising too much with Clinton in budget talks . <p> Dole 's camp interpreted the Texas newspaper poll as devastating to Gramm . <p> " " In Phil Gramm 's own back yard , a Texas dead-heat is great news for Bob Dole and crippling news for Phil Gramm , " spokesman Nelson Warfield said . " " Clearly , Bob Dole is the strongest Republican candidate to win back the White House . " Dole has maintained a significant lead over Gramm and other contenders in national polls of GOP voters . Gramm is seeking re-election to his Senate seat while running for president . <p> This month 's survey shows slight age and gender " " gaps " between supporters of Dole and Gramm . <p> Dole leads , 44 percent to 25 percent , among Texas GOP voters who are 55 or older , while Gramm leads 44 to 17 percent among those 18 to 25 years old . Undecided voters account for the remainder in each category . <p> Dole leads among women , 37 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41 percent to 36 percent . <p> Perhaps a bigger key to Dole 's standing in Texas was the finding that 55 percent of 1,002 Texas voters - Republicans , Democrats and independents - said it was more important that a president " " be willing to compromise to get things done " rather than " " risk government gridlock in order to stick to his principles . " <p> Among this larger group , 34 percent said " " stick(ing) to his principles " is more important . <p> Dole has overseen legislative compromises as the leader of the Senate while Gramm has portrayed himself as more true to Republican principles . <p> Among Gramm supporters , 42 percent said " " stick(ing) to his principles " is more important . Among Dole supporters , 28 percent took that view . <p> Jane Moye , an oil company administrator from Sugar Land , was torn between Dole and Gramm . <p> " " Dole , although he seems controversial right now with the budget and everything , is a leader and perceives the problems that the country is having and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " " Phil Gramm , I 'd have to do more listening to him , " Moye added . " " He 's been campaigning for so long , you kind of get tired of listening to him , but I think he has a strong government background and ( is ) a strong candidate for running the country . " Retiree Bernice Barnett of Temple said she favors Dole because " " he 's more down to earth , I can understand him better than the rest . " Blum said the survey indicates that Dole has a strong chance of winning some of Texas ' nominating delegates in the March 12 primary . <p> In each of the state 's 30 congressional districts , three delegates go to the candidate who takes a majority of the presidential vote . If no candidate gets the majority , the second place finisher gets a proportionate number of delegates if that candidate attracts at least 20 percent of the vote . <p> In addition to the 90 delegates awarded from each congressional district , Texas dispenses 33 " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the delegates selected nationwide . <p> Dole and Gramm each run slightly ahead of President Clinton in hypothetical general election matchups , according to the survey of 1,002 Texas voters . <p> Without major independent candidates in the race , Dole leads Clinton , 44 percent to 38 percent , and Gramm leads Clinton , 46 percent to 39 percent . <p> Several survey indicators make a Democratic presidential candidate 's chances look bleak in Texas : <p> Fifty-two percent of the sample of voters said they disapprove of the way Clinton is doing his job . Forty percent said they approve , and 8 percent were unsure . <p> The pollsters said Clinton 's clearest support came from groups least likely to vote : blacks , the poor and the least educated . <p> Exactly half of those surveyed said they trust Republicans more than Democrats to lead the country for the next four years , while 33 percent favored the Democrats . Nine percent said they were unsure , and 7 percent said " " neither " party could be trusted to lead . <p> A third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themselves as Republicans , with another 12 percent leaning toward the Republican side . Twenty-six percent identified themselves as Democrats , with another 7 percent leaning Democratic . The rest said they were independent , affiliated with another party or declined to answer . Despite the widespread portrayal of the electorate as restless for new ideas and independent candidates , a plurality of 42 percent of the 1,002 voters surveyed said a third party would make no difference in how American government functions . <p> Thirty percent said a third party would make government better and 23 percent said it would worsen the situation . <p> Thirty-seven percent of the Republican voters said a third party would hurt government performance , compared with only 17 percent of the Democrats . The pollsters attributed the difference to Republican fears that an independent candidate such as Perot would siphon votes from the Republican presidential contender . <p> In the overall survey , 57 percent said they have an unfavorable opinion of Perot and 29 percent reported a favorable view . <p> Asked to name the most important factor in choosing a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said honesty and integrity . Eighteen percent said the candidates ' position on major issues is most important , and an equal amount said the candidates ' " " caring about people like me " is paramount . <p> Half of the respondents said " " flip-flopping on major issues " is the candidate trait most likely to cause them to vote for someone else . A fourth of the voters said " " running a negative campaign " is the most objectionable action . <p> Thirty percent said the president can make a great deal of difference in solving the nation 's problems . Fifty percent said the president can make " " some difference , " 17 percent said " " hardly any difference , " and the rest were undecided . <p> Chronicle/Dallas Morning News Poll : The presidential race Gramm and Dole are running even among Texas Republicans . . . <p> Q : If the candidates in the Republican primary for president were Lamar Alexander , Pat Buchanan , Bob Dole , Bob Dornan # , Steve Forbes , Phil Gramm , Alan Keyes and Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36% . <p> Dole 36% . <p> Alexander 1% . <p> Keyes 3% . <p> Forbes 5% . <p> Lugar 1% . <p> Buchanan 6% . <p> Other/No vote/Not sure 11% . <p> # Bob Dornan did n't qualify for ballot in Texas . <p> . . . and both have statewide edge over Clinton in November . <p> Q : If the general election for president were being held today , and the candidates were Bill Clinton , the Democrat , and Bob Dole , the Republican , for whom would you vote ? <p> Clinton 38% . <p> Dole 44% . <p> Other/Wo n't vote/Not sure 18% . <p> Q : If the general election for president were being held today , and the candidates were Bill Clinton , the Democrat , and Phil Gramm , the Republican , for whom would you vote ? <p> Clinton 39% . <p> Gramm 46% . <p> Other/Wo n't Vote/Not sure 15% . <p> Chronicle/Dallas Morning News Poll/LEADERSHIP <p> Q : What is the most important factor to you this year in choosing a candidate for president ? <p> Experience in government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honesty and integrity 38% . <p> Leadership abilities 16% . <p> Caring about people like me 18% . <p> Other/Not sure 6% . <p> Q : In general , do you approve or disapprove of the job Bill Clinton is doing as president ? <p> Approve 40% . <p> Disapprove 52% . <p> Not sure 8% . <p> Q : In general , do you approve or disapprove of the job Phil Gramm is doing as U.
