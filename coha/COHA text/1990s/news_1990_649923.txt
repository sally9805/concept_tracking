<p> South Koreans are watching Germany unite with a mixture of yearning and apprehension . The tail end of Europe 's political hurricane is only a brisk breeze here . There 's little to celebrate yet . <p> Young people , especially students , blame the U.S. In fact , they blame it for practically everything , from partition in 1945 to the Korean War , to the succession of military dictatorships , to the serious flaws in the current tentative moves to democracy . They do n't believe their own Government , so they are inclined to believe North Korea . It 's a big handicap . <p> Historically there is some basis for the argument about the initial division . As in Germany , the line was drawn as the meeting point for Soviet and American forces . It was to take the Japanese surrender , and not meant to be permanent . But there was n't any prior Allied agreement . <p> At the last minute , two young American officers chose the 38th Parallel because the Soviets were sweeping south , and U.S. troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean Rusk , later Secretary of State , the other was Charles Bonesteel , later a commanding general in Korea . <p> The Soviets accepted and proceeded to establish a 33-year-old Communist , Kim Il Sung , on their side . Both forces withdrew in 1948 , but the Soviets left behind a huge arsenal and the Americans left practically nothing . So in 1950 , with Stalin 's approval , Kim Il Sung rolled south to take the lot . He nearly succeeded before the Americans returned . <p> But the students do n't know that . All they learn is that the North was the aggressor , which they consider typical anti-Communist propaganda that must therefore be false . They get no details , and no outside information . <p> People are serving long jail terms for unauthorized visits to North Korea , its radio is jammed , and the law prohibits circulating anything about the North that has n't been approved . <p> This week , large contingents of riot police swooped through two university campuses in Seoul , itself illegal , to confiscate a North Korean film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with bludgeons and tear gas , leaving an unreported number injured . Thirty students were arrested , the papers said . <p> The film happened to be about a revolutionary Korean organizing resistance against the brutal Japanese regime in the 1930 's . No matter the content . No matter that North and South Koreans were holding a joint film festival in New York when the raids occurred . That was approved . <p> Talks with a half-dozen students , all between 23 and 25 , showed the natural angry reaction . One was truly radical . He believed Communism is better even if students ca n't speak up or demonstrate " because there has to be ideological unity and a strong party to create the atmosphere for freedom . " He accepted the massacre at Tiananmen Square " because sometimes people have to be killed for the great and glorious cause of the masses . " <p> He allowed that he had been puzzled about the collapse of Communist regimes in Europe , but then he figured out it was because " they let in elements of capitalism ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sung 's line , full-blooded Stalinism . He 's never seen what it means . <p> Others ranged from mild skepticism about the North to mild approval . But they all wanted to see for themselves , distrusted their own government and ached for reunification . Asked which system he thought was better , one said , " I 've never lived in a socialist country so I do n't know about that , but I can see that capitalism is n't good . " <p> Officials realize Germany 's success came from the West 's insistence on the maximum human contact the East could be persuaded to accept . But they say they ca n't allow exchanges to escape control . They do n't trust South Korea 's impressive achievements . True , they have n't built the solid democratic base West Germany established , but that too would mean loosening control and risking loss of personal power . <p> There are important differences , but no reason for sustaining this self-demeaning barrier to the goal of national unity in peace and freedom . North Korea is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea has built its own wall , which keeps its people ignorant and weakens its spirit . <p> The U.S. should urge Seoul to remove its self-inflicted blinders . As it is , we are blamed for them . Both the U.S. and Korea would gain if this last , detested cold war partition could be melted without violence . Standing up for democracy can win in this part of the world too .
