In the park you see things . But not what I saw tonight . God , God ... I wanted to be dreaming but I was awake , smelling chili meat and onions and the pine trees . First , the car drove up to the edge of the parking lot . They got out and talked and he grabbed her , like in a hug . I thought maybe they were going to kiss and I 'd watch that . Then all of a sudden , she made a weird sound -- surprised , squeaky , like a cat or dog that gets stepped on . He let go of her and she fell . Then he bent down next to her and his arm started moving up and down really fast . I thought he was punching her , and that was bad enough , and I kept thinking should I do something . But then I heard another sound , fast , wet , like the butcher at Stater Brothers back in Watson chopping meat -- chuck chuck chuck . He kept doing it , moving his arm up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on fire . My legs were cold . Then they turned hot-wet . Pissing my pants like a stupid baby ! The chuck chuck stopped . He stood up , big and wide , wiped his hands on his pants . Something was in his hand and he held it far from his body . He looked all around . Then in my direction . Could he see me , hear me -- smell me ? He kept looking . I wanted to run but knew he 'd hear me . But staying here could trap me -- how could he see anything behind the rocks ? They 're like a cave with no roof , just cracks you can look through , which is the reason I picked them as one of my places . My stomach started to churn around , and I wanted to run so badly my leg muscles were jumping under my skin . A breeze came through the trees , blowing up pine smell and piss stink . Would it blow against the chili-burger 's wrapping paper and make noise ? Would he smell me ? He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of a sudden he jumped ran back to the car , got in , drove away . I did n't want to see when he passed under the lamp at the corner of the parking lot , did n't want to read the license plate . PLYR 1 . The letters burned into my mind . Why did I look ? Why ? * I 'm still sitting here . My Casio says 1:12 A.M. I need to get out of here , but what if he 's just driving around and comes back -- no , that would be stupid , why would he do that ? I ca n't stand it . She 's down there , and I smell like piss and meat and onions and chili . Real dinner from the Oki-Rama on the Boulevard , that Chinese guy who never smiles or looks at your face . I paid $2.38 and now I want to throw it up . My jeans are starting to get sticky and itchy . Going over to the public bathroom at the other end of the lot is too dangerous ... that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a job . He was n't as big as Moron , but he was big enough . She trusted him , let him hug her ... what did she do to make him so mad ... could she still be alive ? No way . Impossible . I listen carefully to see if she 's making any sounds . Nothing but the freeway noise from across the east side of the park and traffic from the Boulevard . Not much traffic tonight . Sometimes , when the wind blows north , you hear ambulance sirens , motorcycles , car honks . The city 's all around . The park looks like the country , but I know the difference . Who is she ?  - -  forget that , I do n't want to know . What I want is to put tonight on rewind . That squeaky sound -- like he took the air right out of her . For sure she 's ... gone . But what if she is n't ? Even if she is n't , she will be soon , all that chucking . And what could I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my face in her blood ? What if he comes back while I 'm doing it ? Would he come back ? That would be stupid , but there are always surprises . She sure found that out . I ca n't help her . I have to put this all out of my mind . I 'll sit here for ten more minutes -- no , fifteen . Twenty . Then I 'll get my Place Two stuff together and move . Where to ? Place One , up near the observatory , is too far , and so are Three and Four , even though Three would be good ' cause it has a stream for washing . That leaves Five , in the fern tangle behind the zoo , all those trees . A little closer , but still a long walk in the dark . But it 's also the hardest one to find . Okay , I 'll go to Five . Me and the animals . The way they cry and roar and smash against their cages makes it hard to sleep , but tonight I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and wait . Pray . Our Father in heaven , how about no more surprises ? Not that praying ever got me anything , and sometimes I wonder if there 's anyone up there to pray to or just stars -- humongous balls of gas in an empty black universe . Then I get worried that I 'm blaspheming . Maybe some kind of God is up there ; maybe He 's saved me lots of times and I 'm just too dumb to know it . Or not a good enough person to appreciate Him . Maybe God saved me tonight , putting me behind the rocks , instead of out in the open . But if he had seen me when he drove up , he probably would 've changed his mind and not done anything to her . So did God want her to ... No , he just would 've gone somewhere else to do it ... whatever . In case You saved me , thank You , God . In case You 're up there , do You have a plan for me ? Chapter Two Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Petra Connor was well into overtime but up for more action . Sunday , she 'd enjoyed unusually peaceful sleep from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. , no gnawing dreams , thoughts of ravaged brain tissue , empty wombs , things that would never be . Waking to a nice , warm afternoon , she took advantage of the light and spent an hour at her easel . Then , half a pastrami sandwich and a Coke , a hot shower , and off to the station to finalize the stakeout . She and Stu Bishop rolled out just after dark , cruising alleys and ignoring minor felonies ; they had more important things on their minds . Selecting a spot , they sat watching the apartment building on Cherokee , not talking . Usually they chatted , managed to turn the boredom into semi-fun . But Stu had been acting weird lately . Remote , tight-lipped , as if the job no longer interested him . Maybe it was five days on graveyard . Petra was bugged , but what could she do -- he was the senior partner . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Getty . Amazing pigments , superb use of light . Two hours of butt-numbing stasis . Their patience paid off just after 2 A.M. and another imbecilic but elusive killer hooked up . Now she sat at a scabrous metal desk opposite Stu , completing the paperwork , thinking about going back to her apartment , maybe doing some sketching . The five days had energized her . Stu looked half-dead as he talked to his wife . It was a warm June , well before daybreak , and the fact that the two of them were still there at the tail end of a severely understaffed graveyard shift was a fluke . Petra had been a detective for exactly three years , the first twenty-eight months in Auto Theft , the remaining eight in daytime Homicide with Stu . Her partner was a nine-year vet and a family man . Day shift suited his lifestyle and his biorhythms . Petra had been a nighthawk from childhood , before the deep blue midnights of her artist days , when lying awake at night had been inspirational . Well before her marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep . She lived alone now , loved the black of night more than ever . Black was her favorite color ; as a teenager she 'd worn nothing but . So was n't it odd that she 'd never asked for nighttime assignments since graduating the academy ? It was adherence to duty that brought about the temporary switch . Wayne Carlos Freshwater crawled out at night , scoring weed and crack and pills on Hollywood side streets , killing prostitutes . No way was he going to be found when the sun shone . Over a six-month period , he 'd strangled four streetgirls that Petra and Stu knew about , the last one a sixteen-year-old runaway from Idaho who he 'd tossed in an alley Dumpster near Selma and Franklin . No cutting , but a pocketknife found at the scene yielded prints and led to a search for Freshwater . Incredibly stupid , dropping the blade , but no big surprise . Freshwater 's file said his IQ had been tested twice by the state : 83 and 91 . Not that it had stopped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five-foot-seven , 140 , multiple arrests and convictions over the last twenty years , the last for an ag assault/attempted rape that sent him to Soledad for ten years -- cut down , of course , to four . The usual sullen mug shot ; bored with the process . Even when they caught him , he looked bored . No sudden moves , no attempt at escape , just standing there in a rancid hallway , pupils dilated , faking cool . But after the cuffs went on , he switched to wide-eyed surprise . Whud I do , Officer ? The funny thing was , he looked innocent . Knowing his size , Petra had expected some Napoleon full of testosterone , but here was this dainty little twerp with a dainty little Michael Jackson voice . Neatly dressed , too . Preppy , brand-new Gap stuff , probably boosted . Later , the jailer told her Freshwater 'd been wearing women 's underwear under the pressed khakis . The ten-year Soledad invitation had been for choking a sixty-year-old grandmother in Watts . Freshwater was released angrier than ever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violence level . Great system . Petra used the memory of Freshwater 's moronic surprise to get herself smiling as she completed the report . Whud I do ? You were a bad , bad boy . Stu was still on the phone with Kathy : Home soon , honey ; kiss the kids for me . Six kids , lots of kissing . Petra had watched them line up for Stu before dinner , platinum heads , sparkling hands and nails . It had taken her a long time to be able to look at other people 's kids without thinking of her own useless ovaries . Stu loosened his tie . She caught his eye , but he looked away . Going back on days would be good for him . He was thirty-seven , eight years Petra 's senior , looked closer to thirty , a slim , nice-looking man with wavy blond hair and gold-hazel eyes . The two of them had been quickly labeled Ken and Barbie , even though Petra had the dark tresses . Stu had a taste for expensive traditional suits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk ties , carried the most frequently oiled 9mm in the department , and a Screen Actors Guild card from doing bit parts in TV cop shows . Last year he 'd made Detective-III . Smart , ambitious , a devout Mormon ; he and pretty Kathy and the half-dozen tykettes lived on a one-acre spread in La Crescenta . He 'd been a great teacher for Petra -- no sexism or personal garbage , a good listener . Like Petra , a work fiend , driven to achieve maximal arrests . Match made in heaven . Till a week ago . What was wrong ? Something political ? The first day they partnered he informed her he was thinking about shifting to the paper track eventually , going for lieutenant . Preparing her for good-bye , but he had n't mentioned it since . Petra wondered if he was aiming even higher . His father was a successful ophthalmologist , and Stu had grown up in a huge house in Flintridge , surfed in Hawaii , skied in Utah ; was used to good things . Captain Bishop . Deputy Chief Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graying temples , Cary Grant crinkles , charming the press , playing the game . But doing a solid job , because he was substance as well as style . Freshwater was a major bust . So why did n't it matter to him ? Especially because he was the one who 'd really solved it . The old-fashioned way . Despite the Joe Clean demeanor , nine years had made him an expert on streetlife , and he 'd collected a stable of low-life confidential informants . Two separate C.I . ' s had come through on Freshwater , each reporting that the hooker killer had a heavy crack habit , was selling stolen goods on the Boulevard at night and scoring rock at a flop apartment on Cherokee . Two gift-wraps : precise address , down to the apartment number , and exactly where the dealers ' lookouts hung out . Stu and Petra staked out for three nights . On the third , they grabbed Freshwater as he entered the building from the back , and Petra got to clamp the cuffs . Delicate wrists . Whud I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrest form 's inadequate spaces with her elegant draftsman 's hand . Just as Stu hung up his phone , Petra 's jangled . She picked up and the sergeant downstairs said , " Guess what , Barbie ? Got a call from the park rangers over at Griffith . Woman down in a parking lot , probable 187 . Tag , you 're it " " Which lot in Griffith ? " " East end , back behind one of the picnic areas . It 's supposed to be chained off , but you know how that goes . Take Los Feliz like you 're going to the zoo ; instead of continuing on to the freeway , turn off . The blues 'll be there along with a ranger car . Do it Code 2 . " " Sure , but why us ? " " Why you ? " The sergeant laughed . " Look around . See anyone else but you and Kenny ? Blame the city council . " She hung up . " What ? " said Stu . His Carroll &; Company foulard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But tired , definitely tired . Petra told him . He stood and buttoned his jacket . " Let 's go . " No gripe . Stu never complained .
