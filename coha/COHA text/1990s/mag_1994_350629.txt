Science is like a flashlight ; what it illuminates depends on where it is pointed . Traditionally , U.S. scientists have been free to decide for themselves where to focus their research . From time to time , politicians and interest groups would lobby for specific agendas  --  space exploration , say , or AIDS or breast cancer . But by and large , science in America has been run by the scientists . <P> That is about to change . In what could be the most significant redirection of U.S. science policy since World War II , the Clinton Administration this month is launching an ambitious Cabinet-level effort to set national priorities and push the country 's vast federal research program toward those goals . In effect , the government has grabbed the flashlight . <P> The immediate aims , as President Clinton never tires of saying , are to boost the economy , strengthen U.S. industry , protect the environment , improve education and create jobs . The scientific resources that could be applied to that campaign are immense : more than 700 federal laboratories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and engineers , and a national research budget of $76 billion . But the risks , say critics , are equally immense . By putting blinders on the pursuit of knowledge , they fear , the Administration could frustrate a research community that is the envy of the world . <P> The policy that the Administration inherited dates back to the late 1940s , when the scientific resources that had been marshaled for World War II  --  including the top-secret Manhattan Project , which built the atom bomb  --  were reorganized to serve the period of economic growth ( and the uneasy peace ) that followed . Under a philosophy outlined by Vannevar Bush , science adviser to Presidents Roosevelt and Truman , the huge flow of public dollars allocated to cure diseases and fight the cold war was distributed according to a chaotic system dubbed " scientific pluralism . " Basically this meant that the money was funneled through review boards manned by scientists , who gave it to researchers proposing projects considered worthy . The system led to quite a bit of waste and overlap , but it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to creating the transistor . <P> Then , in the late 1980s , the cold war eased and the money ran low  --  in part because the economy sagged as budget and trade deficits soared . American scientific breakthroughs were still leading to dazzling new products  --  but too many of them were being manufactured in Japan . Pressure began to mount in Congress to cut defense funding and reshape America 's amorphous research effort into a coherent program that would aid industry . But Presidents Reagan and Bush resisted the pressure because the strategy smacked of government meddling in the marketplace . <P> Clinton , in contrast , has embraced the idea of a national industrial policy , making it a cornerstone of his plan to reinvigorate the economy . Last November he created the National Science Technology Council , a Cabinet-level body on a par with the National Security Council and the National Economic Council and composed of the secretaries and directors of all the research-oriented departments and agencies in the government . Preliminary meetings of the council 's nine subcommittees have been under way for the past three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first formal meeting next month .
