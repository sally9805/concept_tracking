Brighter Than the Sun Kent , England October 1817 Eleanor Lyndon was minding her own business when Charles Wycombe , Earl of Billington , fell quite literally  --  into her life . She was walking along , whistling a happy tune and keeping her mind busy by trying to estimate the yearly profit of the East &; West Sugar Company ( of which she owned several shares ) when to her great surprise , a man came crashing down from the sky and landed at , or to be more precise  --  on her feet . Further inspection revealed that the man in question had fallen not from the sky but from a large oak tree . Ellie , whose life had grown decidedly dull in the last year or so , would have almost preferred that he had fallen from the sky It certainly would have been more exciting than from a mere tree . She pulled her left foot out from underneath the man 's shoulder , hiked her skirts above her ankles to save them from the dirt , and crouched down . " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " All he said was , " Ow . " " Oh , dear , " she murmured . " You have n't broken any bones , have you ? " He did n't say anything , just let out a long breath . Ellie lurched back when the fumes hit her . " Sweet heavens " she muttered , " You smell as if you 've imbibed a winery . " " Whishkey , " he slurred in response . " A gennleman drinks whishkey . " " Not this much whiskey , " she retorted . " Only a drunk drinks this much of anything . " He sat up  --  clearly with difficulty , and shook his head as if to clear it . " Exactly it , " he said , waving his hand through the air , then wincing when the action made him dizzy . " I 'm a bit drunk , I 'm afraid . " Effie decided to refrain from further comment on that topic . " Are you certain you 're not injured ? " He scratched his reddish-brown hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I suspect that is n't only from the fall . " He tried to get up , weaved , and sat back down " You 're a sharp-tongued lass . " " Yes , I know , " she said with a wry smile . " It 's why I 'm a long-toothed spinster . Now then , I ca n't very well see to your injuries if I do n't know what they are . " " Efficient , too , " he murmured . " An ' why are you so certain I 've got an injurty , er , injury ? " Ellie looked up into the tree . The nearest branch which would have supported his weight was a good fifteen feet up . " I do n't see how you could have fallen so far and not been injured . " He waved her comments aside and tried to rise again . " Yes , well , we Wycombes are a hardy lot . It 'd take more than a  - -  Sweet merciful Christ ! " He howled . Ellie tried her best not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pain ? A sprain , perhaps . " His brown eyes narrowed as he clutched the trunk of the tree for support . " You are a hard , cruel woman , Miss whatever-your-name-is , to take such pleasure in my agony . " Ellie coughed to cover a giggle . " Mr. Whosis , I must protest and point out that I tried to tend to your injuries , but you insisted you did n't have any . " He scowled in a very boyish sort of way and sat back down . " That 's Lord Whosis , " he muttered . " Very well , my lord , " she said , hoping that she had n't irritated him overmuch . A peer of the realm held much more power than a vicar 's daughter , and he could make her life miserable if he chose . She gave up all hope of keeping her dress clean and sat down in the dirt . " Which ankle pains you , my lord ? " He pointed to his right ankle , and then grimaced when she lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she looked up and said in her most polite voice , " I am going to have to remove your boot , my lord . Would that be permissible ? " " I liked you better when you were spitting fire , " he muttered . Ellie liked herself better that way , too . She smiled . " Have you a knife ? " He snorted . " If you think I 'm going to put a weapon in your hands ... " " Very well . I suppose I could just pull the boot off . She cocked her head and pretended to ponder the matter . " It might hurt just a bit when it gets stuck on your hideously swollen ankle , but as you pointed out , you come from hardy stock , and a man should be able to take a little pain . " ' What the devil are you talking about ? " Ellie stared to pull at his boot . Not hard she could never be that cruel . Tugging just enough to demonstrate that the boot was n't coming off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He yelled , and Ellie wished she had n't tried to teach him a lesson , because she ended up with a face full of whiskey fumes . " How much did you drink ? " she demanded , gasping for air . " Not nearly enough , " he groaned . " They have n't invented a drink strong enough " " Oh , come now , " Effie snapped . " I 'm not that bad . " To her surprise , he laughed . " Sweetheart , " he said in a tone that told her clear as day that his usual occupation was rake , " you 're the least bad thing that has happened to me in months . " Ellie felt an odd sort of tingling on the back of her neck at his clumsy compliment . Thankful that her large bonnet hid her blush , she focused her attention back on his ankle . " Have you changed your mind about my cutting your boot ? " His answer was the knife he placed in her palm . " I always knew there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just never knew what it was until today . " The knife was a bit dull , and soon Ellie was gritting her teeth as she sawed through his boot .
