CINEMA <P> Twentynothings in Seattle ( 90210 ) <P> BRIDGET FONDA HAS OUR FAVORITE mouth in movies , and a spirit to match ; we 'll happily watch her for the next 40 years . Matt Dillon is perfecting a comic shagginess . Funny Jeremy Piven steals a scene at a check-out counter . The other actors in SINGLES are stuck with playing cliches  --  twentynothings . They mate , they muse , they inhabit soap-opera plots . Meet urban planner Campbell Scott ( " a realist slash dreamer " ) , Greenpeacenik Kyra Sedgwick ( " This whole decade is going to have to be about cleaning up " ) , maitre d ' Jim True ( " I live my life like a French movie " ) . Writer-director Cameron Crowe 's movie lives like too many others . Singles may aspire to be a Big Chill from Seattle , but it is really a fizzled St. Elmo 's Fire with rowdier music . <P> MUSIC <P> Electronic Venture <P> MAYBE THIS IS THE LIBERATION OF SUZANNE VEGA . Hearing DNA 's hip-hop remix of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk singer to venture beyond the safety of her acoustic guitar . Her latest album , 99.9 F degrees , is a bold experiment in both verse and technology , with Vega 's haunting images now pegged to electronic percussion and warped-sounding keyboards . Two of the more raucous songs , Rock in This Pocket and Fat Man and Dancing Girl , are even hot enough to hit the dance circuit . But unvarnished Vega fans need not fret : the album still sports tunes like Blood Sings , in which she breaks from technopop and delivers straight folk with Dylanesque force . <P> TELEVISION <P> Top Cops <P> TV COP SHOWS ( FICTIONAL ONES , ANYway ) have gone so decisively out of fashion that THE HAT SQUAD looks downright fresh . The new CBS series , about three brothers who wear black fedoras as members of a police special-crimes unit , is in many ways the most preposterous new show of the season . In last week 's premiere , the villain , a sadistic ex-con , was an unstoppable monster straight out of Friday the 13th , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road Runner cartoons look realistic . Still , creator Stephen J. Cannell ( The A-Team , Hunter ) has a knack for vivid characters and punchy dialogue , and he invests the genre with the good-vs. - evil intensity of an old- fashioned western . Also , the hats are cool . <P> BOOKS <P> Whirling Electrons <P> WHILE MOST READERS HAVE BEEN LOOKing the other way , writer Eric Kraft has turned out a series of whiz-bang novellas about a kid named Peter Leroy who does a lot of neat stuff , like thinking , squidging for clams with his toes and noticing the fantastic legs of his new science teacher , Miss Rheingold . Now the out-of-print novellas have been published by Crown as LITTLE FOLLIES ( $22 ) and Peter 's new adventures as WHERE DO YOU STOP ? ( $15 ) . Kraft misses endless opportunities to be poisonously cute about a smart boy who likes words ( spline , ontology ) and worries about the universe being mostly empty ( and since it is expanding , every day emptier ) space between whirling electrons .
