<p> IT 'S BETTER TO LAUGH <p> I have to laugh , again , at political knights charging windmills , only to be lifted out of their saddles , again . Campaign donation limits in Colorado are ruled too limiting ( " Election donation limits ruled low , " Aug. 12 ) , and thrown wide open ( " Sky 's the limit on Colo. campaign gifts , " Aug. 13 ) . That 's what you get when you attack symptoms instead of problems - tossed from your saddle to the laughter of the crowd . People have seen that limits do n't work , do n't help us feel in control of the government , but this feels like we have no control . The front page is more ironic than the comics . Big money is back in charge with no curb on the thinly veiled " educational ads " that never touched the candidates ' limits . If you do n't laugh , you have to cry , or just ignore what you ca n't control . <p> David Broder ( " Rules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novice politicians start with issues , but soon give up and just project a good image and use negative attacks . The people want substance but money wins elections . Politicians bemoan not having time to focus on issues and raise the money it takes to win . But with ads so expensive and the field so crowded , image and attack are all most politicians can afford . More irony . With the current crowded ballots , even candidates who want to laugh and cry about the ironies are forced to throw up their hands and let the image-makers rule . <p> Then with the irony of crocodile tears , Sue O'Brien ( " Politics-as-celebrity breeds boredom , " Aug. 8 ) complains how the press does n't have the time for more than " Politics-as-celebrity . " Even Sue has given up on whether to laugh or cry at the ironies , and now moves to boredom . <p> Do n't forget the voters - we must remember to laugh at ourselves . Most of us walk into a voting booth hot on a race or three ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races and issues , but we end with a few we really do n't know much about . But with a crowded ballot , we get a campaign of image and attack , and overloaded press , and frustrated voters . Instead of a satisfying discussion with policymakers , low voter turnout shows how many have given up . <p> Politicians , press and voters are all burning out with long ballots and the ad money . Campaign limits , like term limits , Bruce 's TABOR , etc. , try to deal with symptoms . One way to connect voters and politicians : Single-issue ballots , which would run 10 to 12 a year , monthly . A little bit , all the time is easier than the current circus . It would cost more , but one hell of a lot less than campaign matching funds . The front page will still be more ironic than the comics , but with lower stress we might laugh better . WALT GEISEL Denver NO EVIL HERE <p> Re : " Springs minister torches Pokemon , tells kids it 's evil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I was reading ! Pokemons evil ? ! <p> Colorado Springs children 's pastor Mark Juvera 's accusations of Pokemon being " evil " really ca n't be justified . The cartoon is filled with very good morals and lessons , such as the value of friendship and teamwork , as well as loyalty and love for others , and I see no way that that can be viewed as " evil . " How does such a man come off as saying Pokemon is Satanic ? The word " master " in the game does not refer to being a ruler , but to knowing the most about Pokemon , and having seen and befriended them all . ELIZABETH JOHNSON Meeker SATANIC IMAGE Pokemon may be a toy , a cartoon character , but Pastor Juvera is sending a clear message to the youth of his congregation : If you dislike something , the appropriate response is violence . Fire , butchery and dismemberment . <p> The image of Pastor Juvera 's 9-year-old son tearing a doll limb from limb and the children of Grace Fellowship Church chanting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " is as chilling as any Satanic ritual Pastor Juvera could describe . MATTHEW F. PORTER Golden DELIGHT THE DEVIL If there is a devil , it must be clapping with glee at pastor Mark Juvera 's demonstration to the 85 children from the Grace Fellowship Church in Colorado Springs . The children , aged 6 through 12 , will remember these methods long after the Pokemon dolls have hit the trash bins . And parents are worried about the violence their children are exposed to on the Net ! FRED BUSCHHOFF Denver VIOLENT MESSAGE Is this really the message we want to be sending to children ? That violence against things you hate is a viable , even acceptable , solution ? In the wake of the Columbine disaster , religious groups were quick to point fingers at the violence inherent in video games or rap music . Yet , why put up with the noise and heavy beat of the entertainment media , when apparently one can witness sufficient display of violence in the peacefulness of one 's church ? MIRANDA LYNCH Littleton GUN ALTERNATIVE How refreshing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun violence . Escaping a fiery blowtorch or piercing sword would seem much easier than dodging a speeding bullet . STEVE SMITH Denver ROLE REVERSAL <p> I continue to be confused by Colorado 's political structure . When I arrived , Roy Romer was governor . Federico Pena was mayor of Denver . Then Wellington Webb became mayor , and , just recently , Bill Owens became governor . However , he deports himself more as mayor of Denver rather than as governor of Colorado . Meantime , Mayor Webb seems to spend about a third of his time on extra-curricular activities . Gov . Owens seems to be obsessed with the traffic congestion of I-25 through the DTC area . This , I think would be a major concern of Mayor Webb . The governor should be concerned with the more serious deteriorating conditions of the highways east and west of I-25 . The governor and the mayor should take a hard look at the major cause of the traffic jam in Denver and other cities of the Front Range : I-25 stretching from New Mexico , north through all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be working for the construction of an alternate I-25 , running roughly parallel to the present I-25 but about 10-15 miles east . This alternate should have only a few access points - Trinidad , Pueblo , Colorado Springs , Denver , Fort Collins and Cheyenne . This would remove a major portion of the truck traffic as well as much of the auto traffic that now clutters the centers of the Front Range cities . CHARLES BRAD BROUILLETTE Littleton WHITHER LIGHT RAIL ? Having studied information supplied by RTD , Colorado Department of Transportation and south-east corridor 's consulting engineers , the integrity of the light-rail project appears to be in question . The motoring public is being swindled by the donation of priceless right-of-way comprising the I-25 southeast corridor . It is apparently legal but it is a rip-off nonetheless . Light rail will require the width of three lanes from one end to the other , on one side of I-25 . The maximum assumed widening is eight lanes on either side . There does n't appear to be even partial data on the relative merits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no light rail with up to eight added lanes in each direction . One thing stands out : the proposed addition of one through lane for the entire route , two in certain outlying segments , plus the light-rail right-of-way , will more or less preclude adding more traffic lanes in the future . There may be enough right-of-way for this , but the light rail alignment could make it cost prohibitive . JOHN F. AUSTIN Denver ' YES ' VOTE NEEDED Two years ago , we voted " no " on Guide the Ride , a vote that would have paved the way for many light-rail lines . Now , we are going to try again . This time it 's for a light-rail line down I-25 . <p> If we vote " no " again , this will put light rail to rest for the future . If the people do n't want light rail , then Denver better consider building more freeways . Freeways that lead out of Downtown in four or six directions , including one that goes from Downtown to the Denver Tech Center . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vote " yes . " KEVIN SWALES Aurora KEEP MOTORS OUT OF WILDERNESS <p> On a hike to Evelyn Lake in the Byers Peak Wilderness , I was dismayed to see several people on all-terrain vehicles inside the wilderness boundary . Motorized vehicles are not allowed in wilderness areas . Unfortunately this is not the first time I have seen ATVers , dirt bikers and snowmobilers blatantly ignore the act . They have little to fear ; there are few rangers patrolling , and the fine is a whopping $ 75 if they do get caught . That is certainly not much of a deterrent . <p> What 's sad is that motorized users have thousands of miles of trails available in the national forests . In a small percentage of wilderness , hikers are supposed to be able to have a quiet , non-motorized experience . But no , ATVers go there too . In fact , they seem to go about any place they please . <p> I urge people who love wilderness to write Congress and urge more funding for rangers and vastly increased punishment for violating wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries and allow those who prefer peace and quiet to enjoy it . Try hiking instead . It 's more satisfying than getting somewhere astride some " infernal machine , " and far less damaging to the environment . STEVE BARKER Lakewood ETHNICITY IRRELEVANT <p> " Diversity - not Unanimity , " ( July 25 Michelle Malkin column ) was a perfect exposure of a philosophy foisted off on the citizens of the United States . <p> Many years ago this nation reveled in being a " melting pot " for people of all kinds . Our Pledge of Allegiance , which is mouthed each day before sessions of Congress has the words " one nation indivisible . " Now much of our nation is enamored of " diversity , " which is a contradiction to the pledge . <p> Malkin is to be admired for wanting " readers to know me for my ideas , ideology and idiosyncrasies - not for my Filipino heritage . " But she should be prepared for character attacks . The main question from those who make a living from promoting diversity will be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , of course , twists her article , which only said she did not need recognition of her ethnicity to do her job as a columnist . PHIL DAVIS Aurora Treat DEADLY ILLNESS <p> Carl Rowan 's Aug. 8 column about Atlanta murderer Mark Barton - " Are we helpless against insanity ? " - concludes that we should deal with mental illness as we deal with all sicknesses . Yet he uses words like " crazy " and " bonkers , " which do not encourage people to pursue treatment . Barton 's son might have been taken seriously had he told someone : " My dad is mentally ill . He 's not taking medicine and not seeing a doctor . I 'm afraid he 's going to hurt people like he did before . " <p> If we accept that treating mental illness like other sickness is in the public 's best interest , we need to start using language that grants " medical status " to psychiatric disorders . Paying doctors to treat deadly illness benefits us all . JULIA ALLEN Evergreen Beware THE LUDDITES <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature . <p> I must take issue with writer Bob Ewegen 's contention that there can be no revolution in the electric and gas industry comparable to that which has occurred in the telephone industry . <p> He forgets that most of the revolutionary changes in communications came after the AT &T; breakup - and certainly after deregulation . <p> Comparable changes can happen in electric and gas utilities . For instance , each of these utilities has a wire going into each of its customers - a wire , mind you . The kind of thing AT &T; was willing to break the bank for in acquiring cable access to homes owned by giant Telecommunications , Inc . There is really no reason many truly revolutionary changes ca n't occur in the poor , over-regulated power industry when freed of the heavy hand of regulation . <p> The Luddites who suggest prices will go up in a free-for-all for market penetration are either protecting a franchise or ignorant of market principles . My guess is they fought deregulation of telephones - and airlines for that matter - before it brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERT H. BUCHER Denver IDEOLOGY OBSTRUCTS As three members of the advisory panel created by the Colorado Legislature to study electric restructuring , we applaud your coverage of the debate between the state 's two largest utilities about the merits of competition . But this debate is not the complete story . What 's missing ? <p> The debate over competition ignores urgent Colorado problems including an over-reliance on a single , relatively dirty , fuel source ( coal ) to meet 95 percent of the state 's electric needs , a transmission-constrained electric system that is struggling to meet rapidly growing demands as witnessed by last summer 's outages and key utility and regulatory decision-makers acting like deer " frozen in the headlights . " <p> These problems may be exacerbated by the fact that over the next 15 years Colorado will need close to 5,000 megawatts of new resources to meet demand growth - enough to power two cities the size of Denver . <p> At the same time , this growth provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to move toward a more sustainable energy future . Other western states are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new regional institutions to more efficiently manage transmission facilities . <p> What are Colorado and its advisory panel doing to move toward a better energy future ? Just about nothing . Instead , practical solutions have been lost in the ideological debate over competition . Progress would require the now-warring sides to settle for some slices , rather than the whole loaf . ERIC BLANK Land and Water Fund of the Rockies RON LEHR Attorney , former PUC Chairman SKIP SPENSLEY Attorney Do n't diss ' granola ' Bob Ewegen 's dismissal of renewable energy as " high cost and relatively unreliable " is just plain wrong . <p> Numerous utilities and private companies across the United States are putting up wind turbines - not because they are environmentally friendly , but because they can produce dependable and reasonably priced electricity . Rural road signs and repeater towers use photovoltaic ( solar ) power - because doing so is far less expensive than building new power lines . <p> Dismissing renewable energy as " granola technologies " omits a reasonable , dependable and environmentally friendly piece of our energy puzzle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Source Inc . CONSUMER CONCERNS Left out of the discussion on electric deregulation is how it will affect low-income consumers . Guaranteeing access to a basic necessity of life - electricity - is part of the current regulatory compact and a longstanding national and state social policy . However , low-income consumers may be financially hurt by a move towards restructuring and could lose access to this basic necessity . <p> Low-income consumer protections need to be maintained , strengthened , and secured now and in any future market structure . Any legislation that restructures the electric industry must include a Public Benefits Charge to continue programs that fund payment assistance and energy conservation programs . Also , utilities need to pursue an extensive public outreach program so that low-income consumers are aware of their existing services and what choices they may have in the future . If electricity remains affordable , reliable , available and customer friendly , low-income consumers will win regardless of what happens . KAREN M. BROWN , Exec. director Colo .
