Losing an ability you take for granted-even temporarily-renews your sense of appreciation for it . BY FAITH ANDREWS BEDFORD // ALTHOUGH IT HAS OFTEN BEEN SAID THAT YOU DO NOT MISS something until it is gone , I did not fully understand the truth behind the statement until I lost the use of my right hand for a month . Carpal tunnel syndrome is something of an occupational hazard among writers . When I noticed numbness and weakness in my hand , I began to worry . When holding a pen became excruciating , I panicked . " This will keep your fingers from moving , " the doctor said as she fitted a strapped contraption onto my right hand . " Do n't use this hand for three weeks , " she added , pressing the last strap in place . " Then , we will see . " " May I take it off to sleep ? " I asked visions of insomnia loomed before me . " Only for bathing , " she answered . " But I 'm a writer , " I moaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said crisply . IT WAS N'T UNTIL DINNER THAT evening that the full enormity of this dilemma hit me . Bob and I had been discussing the impending arrival of our second grandchild when I suddenly remembered my promise to help after the baby came . " What if my hand is n't better ? " I fretted . " What if I still have to wear this ? " I dropped my brace onto the table with a loud clunk . " You can be plenty of help with one hand , " Bob said encouragingly . True . I could probably manage some simple meals . I could push the vacuum and mop . I could even drive . But I 'd hoped to take full care of our first grandchild , Carter , so that Jill could rest and attend to the needs of the new baby . Perhaps Carter would have mastered the art of dressing herself by the time I arrived . She had been working on buttoning during our last visit , something I certainly could n't help her with now . " But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out loud to Bob . " Do n't worry , " he assured me . " She will think having a robotic grandmother is cool . " I threatened to bop him with my brace . " And how will I play finger games ? " I groaned . Bob looked up , quizzically . " You know , " I said , " Here Sits the Lord Mayor ' and Two Little Men ' ? And who ever sang I 'm a Little Teapot ' with an aluminum and Velcro spout ? " Bob nodded soberly . ONE OF THE DELIGHTS OF BEING A GRANDmother , I 've discovered , has been playing again all the little games I played with my own children . Like bubbles rising slowly to the surface of my memory , songs and riddles , finger games and crafts burst into consciousness . Just like riding a bicycle , one never forgets how to balance a child on one 's knee and , bobbling her gently , sing , " This is the way the lady rides , trot , trot , trot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankets is not easily forgotten . I had n't sung " Itsy Bitsy Spider " for years but the words came right back . With my immobilized hand , however , I would only be able to make half a spider to crawl up the water spout . Nor could I fold my hands together to make the steepled church with its wiggly-finger congregation that always sends Carter into fits of giggles . And forget about making silly pictures . " Draw me a horsie , Gammy , " Carter orders with the imperious tone that is born of knowing that , for now at least , her word is my command . I draw a horse and , at the last moment , give it an elephant 's trunk . " No , that 's not right , " she squeals . " Oh ? " I say in mock surprise . " Is this better ? " I ask , drawing duck feet on the horse . " No ! " She giggles . Photograph // " How about now ? " I ask , putting horns on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and says , " Silly Gammy . " But I can not even make a straight line with my left hand , so silly pictures are out of the question . Finger painting might work , though . I ALWAYS LIKE TO BRING CARTER A surprise each time we visit . Often it is a book that we can read together at bedtime . Sometimes it is a game . Last time we finger-painted . As I showed Carter the fingerpaint designs you can make with your hands , I could almost hear Mrs. Miller , my second grade art teacher , saying , " Now children , if you lay the side of your hand on the paper and wiggle your little finger back and forth it will make a fish . " I showed Carter that one , then we made snaky vertical movements for underwater plants . Fingers and thumbs made five-petaled sea flowers and our pinkie fingers created bubbles rising from the fishes ' mouths . FOR THREE WEEKS I WROTE STORIES by computer , picking out about Io words a minute with the fingers of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . " Sometimes these things take more time than we expect , " the doctor said . " Come back and see me next week . " But the baby was due soon . " No signs of imminent arrival , " Drew said when we called that evening . " Although tomorrow would be fine with Jill . " " Tell that baby to wait a bit longer , " I sighed . " Take vitamin B complex , " suggested my friend Shirley , who had had carpal tunnel syndrome three years ago . I faithfully popped two maroon pills morning and evening , but the ache continued . At my next visit , the doctor mentioned surgery . Seeing my face pale , she hurriedly assured me that would be a last resort . As I slumped my way out through the doctor 's waiting room , I passed two people in wheelchairs and a woman who was almost completely immobilized by an upper-body cast . I suddenly felt ashamed of my selfpity , realizing that my handicap was minor and , hopefully , temporary . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl ! " Drew announced happily . " Mason Hannah is her name and she 's beautiful . " " Of course she is , " I said , rolling over and nudging Bob awake . We listened sleepily to all the details . I MADE MY PLANE RESERVATION the next morning , doubled my vitamin B dosage , and prayed for recovery . We got daily updates on the baby 's progress : nursing well , gaining weight , sleeping soundly , doing wonderfully . I wished the same could be said of my hand . When Drew corralled Carter long enough to get her to speak on the phone , she shouted , " I 'm a big thither , Gammy . " I told her that was a wonderful thing to be and promised to see her very shortly . Perhaps my hand just needed a deadline . Four days before my flight , I noticed that it no longer ached ; I could pick up light objects . The doctor put me through a few exercises . " I think you may have recovered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cautioned quickly . " I want you to wear the brace at night and do no heavy work with that hand . " " Is finger painting okay ? " I asked . She looked puzzled , and nodded . CARTER GREETED ME AT THE DOOR with a big hug . " I 'm almost free , " she declared , holding up three fingers . Her birthday was in two weeks . " Well , I 'm totally free , " I said , smiling and slowly rotating my finally unbound hand . " Silly Gammy , " she said . " You 're not free ; you 're big ! " My hand worked just fine . It poured tea for tea parties and diapered Mason ; it played dolls and made dinners ; it swept the floorgently . As I quietly rocked Mason , while Jill read Carter a story about King Midas , I realized that all the money in the world can not buy wholeness or guarantee a sound mind and body . And without them , nothing else matters . ON OUR LAST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Song . " I began , " Where is Thumbkin , where is ... ? " " Please make their faces , " she said . So I got out a pen and drew faces on her fingertips and mine . Thumbkin and Pointer , Tall Man and Ring Man and , of course , Pinky-each with two eyes and a smile . " How are you this morning ? " my Pointer bowed to Carter 's . " Very well , I thank you , " she sang in return . " Run and hide . " And our fingers disappeared behind our backs . Drew called upstairs that it was time to leave for the airport . As I climbed into the car , I turned and called good-bye . Carter waved : Five little happy faces flickered on her fingertips . And I waved my happy fingers right back.EX <p>
