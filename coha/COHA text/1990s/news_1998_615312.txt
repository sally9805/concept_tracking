<p> Many nights , Sahit Tola 's 4 1/2-year-old daughter awakes in terror and crawls from her mat to seek sanctuary in her father 's bed . <p> The crackle of gunfire , an almost nightly occurrence in this unsettled country , startles her , making her think for a horrible moment that she is back home in Kosovo . <p> In May , after days of thunderous shelling near their small hamlet of Djakovo , her parents decided it was time to go . The couple gathered their daughter , 8-year-old son and the things they could carry . <p> Leaving in midafternoon , they walked from their village of 300 and headed west . For two days , the parents subsisted only on the cold water that flows in the Dinaric Alps , the jagged mountain range between Kosovo and Albania . The children had rations of candy . At night , they huddled together to keep warm , not lighting fires for fear of discovery . <p> Last week , standing outside the half-built apartment house where his family has found shelter near the port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he described his family 's tortured odyssey . He still wore the pale green sport shirt and jeans he wore the afternoon he decided to flee . As he spoke , his daughter clung to him , her blue saucerlike eyes not blinking . She did n't smile . She said nothing . <p> " I think she 's suffering from some kind of trauma , " said Tola , 38 , a factory worker . " I 've told my children about the fighting . They know who the Serbs are . But what more can I say to them ? " <p> The fighting in Kosovo has made refugees of thousands of families similar to this one . International monitors estimate 250,000 ethnic Albanians have fled their homes during seven months of intense fighting between Serb forces and rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army . <p> Kosovo , which is about 90 percent ethnic Albanian , is the southernmost province of Serbia , one of the two remaining republics of Yugoslavia . It was largely self-governing before President Slobodan Milosevic placed the region under direct Serb rule in 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Serb officials say they are trying to quell a rebellion . <p> While most refugees have found shelter , up to 50,000 remain outdoors in the rugged mountains of Kosovo . If they remain unprotected , relief and government officials fear many may die when winter arrives in a few weeks . <p> About 20,000 refugees have come to Albania , and Albanian officials are preparing for another 20,000 in the belief that most of the rest either will remain in Kosovo , or go elsewhere . <p> But what if more , perhaps many more , decide to turn to their fellow Albanians for shelter ? <p> Hearing the question , Esma Boksi , an official in the northern Albanian town of Shkodra , took a deep breath and let the air escape slowly through pursed lips . <p> " Then God help us , " she said somberly . " We can do no more . " <p> Since June , 4,800 of the refugees have registered with Boksi , a Town Hall worker pressed into service as refugee registrar . They have come in waves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These days , weeks after officials believe the refugee flood has subsided , 20 or so a day still trickle into Boksi 's office . They are seeking identification cards and information about food and housing . <p> Boksi sees some irony in the Kosovars ' asking for help in a place like Shkodra . " This is the poorest place in Albania , " she said . Unemployment is at 20 percent , and about a third of the town 's families are on government relief . " Yet we give them bread and cheese when they come , all we can give . " <p> Outside her small office in a decaying building , the street is more pothole than pavement . Craters in the street and sidewalks are filled with a milkshake-thick ooze of standing water and gray silt . <p> A few streets away , vendors sell fruits and vegetables from blankets laid down over mud . Nearby , goats , bone-thin wild dogs and pigs rummage through garbage and rotting unsold produce . Many windows have no glass , and few buildings seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguish between the living conditions of host and refugee . <p> Yet about 2,500 refugees remain in the Shkodra district , many in private homes , where the government has paid locals a supplement of $ 10 a head to defray costs of sheltering on average 15 refugees per family . <p> Others have been placed in modest hotels and makeshift dormitories . <p> More than 300 have found shelter in a warehouse adjacent to the Catholic Church of Lady Rosare . Last week , construction workers were laboring to convert the warehouse into living quarters . <p> Inside , more than 50 families  --  usually two families to a room  --  live in the dormitory , which rumbles all day with the sounds of hammering and machinery . <p> Fatos Stogha and her family of eight live in a room the size of an American master bedroom . Stogha , 44 , stands barefoot at the door with her tall , lanky 15-year-old son Ruke , a bright-eyed boy eager for a diversion . <p> The room is dark , poorly ventilated and affords no privacy . The building contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kosovo four months ago . The town , about 44 miles from Pristina , the provincial capital , has seen some of the war 's fiercest fighting . She believes her house was destroyed in a Serb offensive . <p> In her room are four steel-frame beds . Along the walls are cardboard boxes of possessions . The family eats in a makeshift canteen . <p> Despite the conditions , she has been well cared for and expressed deep gratitude . " But I want to go home , " she said . " I want to go there as soon as it is possible . " <p> With winter coming , officials are struggling to meet the refugees ' needs . Food seems abundant , thanks to international relief organizations , but there is concern about distribution once winter comes and already difficult roads become impassable . <p> For now , however , the single largest concern remains getting and keeping roofs over the refugees ' heads . That task is complicated by the complex and unstable political and legal conditions in this impoverished former Communist state . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings to make the dormitories , " Boksi said , " but the town government has sold the public buildings to private owners . There are very few public buildings left . " <p> Eventually , the refugees will have to leave , but no one hazards a guess when . Government officials and humanitarian groups are planning for an indefinite stay . <p> " We will care for them as long as it is necessary , " said Tauland Dedja , the government official assigned to coordinate refugee issues . <p> Still , international observers worry the presence of the Kosovars is a destabilizing force for an already fragile government . The country is a tinderbox . Government armories have been looted . Most nights feature various levels of gunfire  --  usually just young men enjoying the power of firing a semiautomatic rifle . <p> " I think we can take care of the humanitarian needs , " said Daan Everts , the ambassador for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe . " The bigger matter is the political problem this poses for an already very difficult situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kosovars ' presence . " This is a serious concern , " he said through a spokesman . " Without international support , Albania does not have a proper infrastructure to support the accommodation of refugees . It is very difficult with a poor economy , great unemployment , a lack of security and a high degree of criminality . The influx of refugees makes an already bad situation even worse . " <p> Refugees are in near unison in their assessment of what would make it possible for them to go home . <p> Hungry to see the power of the U.S. military employed to avenge them , they want NATO forces to strike hard at the Serbs and drive them away . " We need the Americans to deal with the Serbs , " said Skender Idrizaj , who is among the 50 or so refugees housed at the Hotel Rozafa in Shkodra . " We will stay away until the Serbs leave . But if NATO and the Americans do n't act , maybe we will go back anyway . . . . We 'll go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in limbo , a refugee and her grandson wait outside a hotel in Durres , Albania , safe from war , but not fear. / BERT ROUGHTON / Staff Photo : Teenage refugees get water from a hose near temporary housing in the Albanian coastal city of Durres , where the refugee influx is straining an already poor and unstable area. / BERT ROUGHTON / Staff
