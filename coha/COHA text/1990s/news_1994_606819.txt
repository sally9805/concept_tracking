<p> A 19-year-old man with diabetes checks into the hospital with abdominal pain and anemia and to his great surprise is diagnosed with lead poisoning . The problem is traced to capsules of a " natural " medicine imported from India , which the man has been taking to maintain his general good health . <p> A 58-year-old man with heart disease suddenly develops a bleeding disorder that mimics hemophilia . His doctors are stumped until they learn he 's been taking mail-order herbal weight-loss capsules containing papaya extracts , which enhance the activity of conventional blood-thinning drugs that the man is taking . <p> A Canadian woman looks down at her newborn baby in the delivery room and is shocked to see that his forehead and pubic area are covered with hair . After a long investigation , scientists ascribe the bizarre occurrence to a botanical medicine the mother is taking to temper her mood swings ; the label says the capsules contain Siberian ginseng , but analysis shows they contain an entirely different plant  --  a weed rich in chemicals resembling male hormones . <p> These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a conference on herbal medicine sponsored by the National Institutes of Health 's Office of Alternative Medicine and the Food and Drug Administration . The gathering in the District was the first to bring botanical scientists , practitioners of traditional medicine and representatives of the herbal remedy industry together with federal regulators and public health officials to discuss the use and safety of " natural " medicines . <p> Americans last year spent an estimated $ 1 billion on herbal products and increasingly want to know what they are getting in terms of benefits and risks . But with no formal system for tracking problems with the products , little is known about their relative safety . Officials said reports of deaths linked to herbal medicines are rare , but they are worried that other problems may be common but unreported . They also expressed concern about the consequences of long-term use of natural products , where the potential for causing cancer and other illnesses is not known . <p> Proponents of herbal medicine argued that history shows their products to be overwhelmingly safe , and they complained that skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They said the United States is one of the few developed countries that refuses to license any botanicals  --  medicines made directly from roots , stems or leaves  --  relegating these remedies instead to health food stores , naturopathic clinics and Chinatown shops . They argued for the right to make specific health claims for their products , which is currently illegal . And they asked federal officials to allow such claims with a lower standard of proof than is required of conventional drugs , since botanicals ' potential for harm appears to be generally low . <p> For their part , FDA officials said they 'd be happy to consider formal approval of herbal remedies if someone would actually prove them safe and effective in clinical trials . But that suggestion was considered disingenuous by some , given that the millions of dollars such trials cost are unlikely to be recouped for medicinal plants , which sprout from the earth for anyone to pick and often can not be patented . <p> Many FDA-approved medicines are derived from plants , but their ingredients have been purified and standardized . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots that contain hundreds or thousands of chemicals . Proponents of botanical medicine claim that this mix is precisely what makes their products so useful  --  mirroring Mother Nature 's flair for combining ingredients instead of dealing in artificially purified compounds . But regulators see such variability as a quality control nightmare in which one batch of a product may bear little resemblance to the next . <p> Moreover , just because an ingredient is " natural " does not mean it is healthful . Consider poison ivy , or the paralyzing neurotoxins in the Amazonian poison dart frog . Even a long history of use by indigenous healers does not necessarily indicate that a plant-based medicine is safe by modern standards , said Ryan J. Huxtable , a University of Arizona professor of pharmacology . For one thing , people live much longer today than they used to . So long-term effects such as cancer  --  not an issue in cultures with much shorter lifespans  --  must now be considered . <p> Federal officials said they have three major concerns about botanical medicines : <p> * Contamination . Many botanicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The diabetic patient described above , for example , was taking a traditional Hindu , or ayurvedic , medicine known as bhasmas , made from the ashes of burned metals including lead and tin . Other ayurvedic medicines have been found to contain arsenic , mercury and cadmium , said Virginia Murray , an environmental toxicologist at Guy 's and St. Thomas ' Hospital Trust in London . <p> * Drug interactions . Most people who take alternative medicines also take conventional medicines , yet little is known about how these products interact . Even when interactions are well understood , as in the case with papaya extracts and anti-coagulants , warnings may be lacking in advertisements , appearing only in fine print in package inserts . <p> * Misidentification . Sloppiness at harvest  --  and perhaps in some cases outright fraud  --  has led to cases when the plant product described on a label is different from that found in a pill , capsule or tincture . A lack of international agreement on the common or even Latin botanical names for various plants worsens the problem . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sciences at Nature 's Sunshine Products in Provo , Utah , an herb commonly known as Queen of the Meadow is perfectly safe , but one called Queen of the Meadow Root is actually an entirely different plant that contains liver toxins . <p> In perhaps the worst recorded case of herbal confusion , more than 80 European women suffered kidney damage in the early 1990s and many required dialysis after taking a weight-loss drug made from Chinese herbs that were apparently mislabeled . <p> While federal health officials are wary of bringing herbal medicines into the fold of mainstream drugs , they are stepping up research on several remedies . This summer , the FDA gave the go-ahead to three human studies of herbal mixtures ( for premenstrual syndrome , postmenopausal hot flashes , and warts ) , marking the first time the agency has approved formal studies of botanicals . The World Health Organization recently called for a relaxation of efficacy standards for botanical products that have long been used as traditional medicines . And European nations  --  which have historically fostered a proactive stance toward botanicals , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how best to use them  --  are working to harmonize their respective regulations . <p> In Germany , for example , herbal remedies are already fully recognized as medicines under the country 's drug laws . And other European countries , as well as Canada and Australia , are actively pursuing research aimed at making plant-based medicines more reliable and accessible . With consumer demand for natural medicines growing every year , the FDA may find such international momentum difficult to resist . <p> " For 20 years , the FDA has ignored herbs , but now they have to deal with the fact that millions of people are using these plant products , " said Mark Blumenthal , executive director of the American Botanical Council , an Austin-based organization supporting herbal medicine research . " We have to sit down , roll up our sleeves and figure out how to give consumers properly labeled and manufactured herb products with a reasonable presumption of benefit and assurance of safety . "
