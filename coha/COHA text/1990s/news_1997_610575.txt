<p> By 9 p.m. , the Second Chance Big Band is swinging and everyone 's up jitterbugging to " Take the A Train . " <p> There 's Kenneth Benson giving his wife , Gloria , a twirl . They moved to Lilac Lane in 1948 , grabbing one of the little mass-produced cottages that looked palatial to a couple who 'd been doubling up in her mother 's apartment in Queens . " It was just a house , that 's it  --  no street lights , no sidewalks , " Gloria says of their early months on America 's suburban frontier . But where else could a returning GI and his young family spend $ 60 a month , a bargain even then , for a home with a yard ? <p> " We 're here since 1953 , " puts in Carol Lozito between fox trots with her husband , Mike . There 's a lot of good-natured competitiveness in Levittown about who 's an " original " owner and who 's a comparative newcomer , having arrived after there were phones and schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airplane hangar . The Lozitos moved out from Brooklyn , raised five kids on Sycamore Lane , invited their TV-less neighbors over on Saturdays to watch Sid Caesar . <p> The Levittown Nostalgia Dance , part of the year-long anniversary bash that America 's most famous suburb is throwing to mark its 50th year , is aptly named . Beneath the multicolored balloons decorating Levittown Hall , partygoers swap their favorite yarns : <p> How the Levitt &; Sons organization , applying assembly-line techniques to home construction , could send crews swarming through Long Island potato fields and build 30 or more houses a day . How would-be occupants camped out for hours , hoping to snare one of the boxy , look-alike Cape Cods or ranches . How families who 'd braced for years of scrimping and saving suddenly attained home ownership in an eye-blink , thanks to the historic conver- gence of the GI Bill , FHA-insured mortgages and the salesmanship of builder William Levitt . He 's their seer and benefactor , and there is talk of erecting a statue of him in October , the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They said it 'd be a ghost town in five years , that it 'd be a slum , " says Pete Ryan , repeating the old canards of those who sniffed at Levittown 's instant " ticky-tacky " houses and indistinguishable streets . " But it 's a beautiful community .

But they 're entitled to their sense of historic importance . <p> In the 17,447 houses that Levitt &; Sons built here , tens of thousands of young people were swiftly boosted into a different economic stratum .

It 's a way of life that 's been denigrated , but it 's the hallmark of the middle class  --  to be in your own home , tending your own garden . " <p> Similar developments were springing up everywhere in the postwar years , of course . The Levitts created other Levittowns in Pennsylvania and New Jersey , and later built a significant swath of Bowie , Md . But this was the exemplar , the largest of the mass-produced suburbs and , because it was just 30 miles east of Manhattan 's media hordes , the most scrutinized . It was the target of NAACP demonstrations and doctoral dissertations , of dire predictions and then grudging respect . It 's where the Smithsonian is hoping someone will donate a house so it can be dismantled and trucked to Washington to teach future generations about American suburbanization . <p> And the town remains , to some extent , a port of entry . Among those doing the stroll here tonight is a bubbly driving instructor named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and his wife rented Queens apartments for more than a decade until finally , a few years ago , they could afford an expanded ranch house on Mockingbird Lane . Buying into Levittown is no longer a no-money-down deal . But it means much the same thing it did 50 years ago . <p> " It 's a piece of America , " Siegel says , beaming . " A place for an average guy , a nobody , to have a chance . " <p> O Pioneers ! <p> Josh Soren , a local historian , is steering his aging Ford Escort along Levittown 's serpentine streets ( the curves reduce traffic speed for kiddie safety ) , pointing out landmarks . Literal landmarks : The Weber House , at 52 Oaktree Lane , has barely been altered except for the addition of aluminum siding ; that 's why a marker at the curb proclaims it an official historic site . <p> The Webers , who moved in with the very first batch of families on Oct. 1 , 1947 , still occupy this snug Cape ; with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter 's baby carriage with netting to keep out the potato bugs that still plagued the brand-new community . <p> With the sense of destiny Levittowners developed early on , these first families are called " pioneers . " Like settlers on other kinds of frontiers , they endured hardships . Mud , for example  --  none of these 60-by-100-foot plots had lawns yet . No phones except for outdoor booths every few blocks . No stores , prompting salesmen in vans and station wagons to circle the streets selling baby formula , produce and eggs . <p> Yet to hear the pioneers tell it , they 'd found the promised land . The Cantors , Mildred and Herbert , were living elsewhere on Long Island , " in a one-room apartment with a Murphy bed and a kitchenette and a closet , " Millie says . When they visited a friend in a Levittown Cape , " it seemed huge to me . Four rooms ! " They signed a lease ( the first Levitt houses were rentals initially ) and later bought a 1951 ranch with a picture window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could be homeowners without a down payment  --  for just $ 64 a month , including taxes . <p> " It was such a cohesive community , " Millie Cantor reminisces . " Everybody was in the same boat , facing the same problems  --  as simple as how to find a good plumber , as complicated as how to start a library . " And it was true  --  with its population of returning vets and their rapidly expanding families , Levittown had a strikingly homogeneous population of first-time owners . " We all borrowed from one another , " Cantor says . " Gardening equipment . Cooking equipment . If you had a big party , you 'd borrow my 36-cup coffee urn , and maybe I 'd borrow your fluted pan . " <p> The new suburb , which by 1960 had more than 65,000 residents , almost a third of them under age 10 , mobilized baby-sitting co-ops and buying co-ops and car pools . " It became a community very quickly , " says Clare Worthing , also a refugee from a one-room apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worthing 's block broke an arm while his mother was away , a mom down the street knew who his doctor was . " By the time the mother got back , " Worthing recalls , " the boy 's arm was in a cast and everything was hunky-dory . " <p> Neighborliness was a familiar quality in the Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods many Levittowners hailed from . But other traits were carefully reinforced by the Levitt organization itself . Covenants written into the town 's leases and purchase agreements provided " all sorts of subtle and not-so-subtle rejoinders about how to live like middle-class people , " says Hofstra 's Kelly . <p> There were rules requiring that lawns be trimmed weekly and shrubs be kept below four feet in height . Laundry could be hung only on the umbrella-style dryers that Levitt provided , only in the back yard and only on weekdays ; flapping clotheslines were an unwelcome reminder of the city . Paint colors could not be changed . <p> This enforced sameness , the object of considerable derision from social critics , has faded with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vengeance was a mania for home remodeling . " You know spring is here when you see vinyl siding being put on , " says longtime resident Daphne Rus . Fewer than 200 homes , local historians estimate , remain the **29;1204;TOOLONG structures that the Levitts built ; the Smithsonian 's search for someone who 'll donate a pristine 1949 ranch has proved fruitless to date . Almost every house has been transformed . <p> It 's sometimes hard to visualize the original bungalows within these elaborate creations . Residents have pushed out the fronts , built out the backs , attached garages and carports and then converted them to dining rooms or dens . Houses have sprouted double dormers , triple dormers , entire second floors ; they 've acquired brick facades , Tara-like pillars , even Victorian-style gingerbread . The spindly trees planted a half-century ago arch overhead ; the shrubs , whose height no one measures any longer , are lush . <p> But one stipulation of Levitt 's covenant proved potent and long-lasting . Clause 25 barred occupancy " by any person other than members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Decades after it lost any legal force , it might as well remain in effect . <p> ' An Evil Legacy ' <p> Like the Worthings and the Cantors and other pioneers , Eugene and Bernice Burnett live in a much-expanded ranch house with a picture window . But the Burnetts ' home is in Wheatley Heights , about a half-hour 's drive east . <p> Along with other returning veterans , Eugene Burnett had seen the newspaper ads touting Levittown ( " So hurry out , Mr. Kilroy . . . " ) . In East Harlem , where heroin had begun to appear , " we saw some of our childhood friends destroying their lives , " Eugene says . " We decided we did not want to raise our family in New York . " <p> So the Burnetts drove out one afternoon in 1949 and joined the throngs milling through Levittown 's model homes . " I found the salesman and said , ' I like your house and I 'm considering buying one . Could you give me the application ? ' " Burnett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . But the owners of this development have not yet decided to sell to Negroes . ' I was shocked out of my shoes . " <p> The drive back to Harlem was grim . " I do n't know how I did n't start World War III that day , " Eugene says . Bernice , sitting next to him at their dining room table , adds , " I still think of you talking about throwing a hand grenade , blowing the place up . " Instead , swallowing their anger and disappointment , the Burnetts found a similar house in another Long Island development that was virtually all black . In search of better schools , they later bought their current house in then-white Wheatley Heights in 1960 ; now white flight has made this , too , a mostly black community . <p> " Levitt left us with an evil legacy , " Burnett says . " We are a very segregated community here on Long Island , and I think that 's his heritage . " <p> Whether Levitt and Levittowners had much choice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mix of Catholics , Protestants and Jews ; it also attracted both white- and blue-collar workers , from dentists and engineers to assembly-line workers . But race has proved an intractable division . The restrictive covenant was deleted later in 1949 , and locals believe that African American families would be accepted in greater numbers now . But the 1990 census revealed a nearly all-white town : Total population  --  53,286 . Black residents  --  118 . <p> " At that time , nothing was integrated , " objects Rus , an officer in the Levittown Property Owners Association and a defender of William Levitt , who died three years ago . " If he 'd tried to do that , he 'd never have been able to sell the houses . " And it 's true that segregation was a policy well beyond Levitt 's lanes : The FHA 's manuals recommended restrictive covenants to maintain racial separation , considered crucial to neighborhood stability . " The FHA would n't underwrite a development that was n't segregated , " Hofstra 's Kelly says . <p> " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnett argues . In the alternative view , the postwar exodus from the cities presented a historic opportunity : tens of thousands of blacks and whites of similar economic status , returning veterans desperate for housing , might have been able to form integrated communities . Instead , racism was reinforced . " That was his moment , " Burnett says of Levitt . " And being a Jew , he should have stood up and made his point . " <p> That history lingers in Levittown , where more than 400 houses are sold in an average year  --  at still-affordable average prices of $ 130,000 to $ 160,000  --  but the black population has never neared 1 percent . " I have a feeling there 's a stigma related to Levittown , " says Clare Worthing 's husband , Jerry . " A kind of ' They did n't want us ; we do n't want them . ' " <p> But as a white suburb , Levittown is hardly unique , on Long Island or anywhere else . In fact , the ways in which Levittown is remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Buoyant Time ' <p> Swan Lane is buzzing with life on a warm spring weekend . The Mastersons are toting sacks of topsoil and flats of geraniums into their back yard . Kids glide by on bikes and play basketball under curbside hoops . Fran Pearlman confers with her neighbor about who 's driving their girls to a birthday party this afternoon . Aside from the revamped architecture , the scene could have been lifted from 1955 . " It just keeps regenerating , " says Pearlman , 38 , who grew up in a Levitt ranch house herself . <p> But Levittown has changed , of course . Much of the spirit that the pioneers recall in such glowing terms was a product of postwar optimism and an unusually homogeneous settlement . " There 's a certain period of your life , when you 're just starting out and your children are young , when everything is an adventure , " author Kelly notes . " It 's a buoyant time , no matter where you are . And the fact that so many people in that community were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that sense of wonder . " <p> The pioneers have seen the social landscape evolve since then . They 've watched the population go gray . In 1960 , fewer than 3 percent of residents were over 65 . " What we did n't have in Levittown , " Millie Cantor says , " was a funeral parlor . " Now , with the over-65 population at 11 percent , the bulletin board at the library advertises hospices and osteoporosis workshops . A plan to build senior-citizen housing here was voted down in a March referendum , but the question of where and how aged Levittowners will live remains a pressing one . <p> Young families continue to move in , of course ; after a long decline , school enrollment is again increasing . But the co-op nursery schools of yore have not rematerialized , reflecting another seismic change : In today 's Levittown , women work . The proportion of Levittown women in the labor force jumped from about a quarter in 1960 , according to the county planning commission , to 60 percent in 1990 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen neighbors might make a midweek trip to Jones Beach , the kids playing in the sand , the mothers yakking . " That was where women began to talk about going back to school , finishing their educations , " Cantor says . " They needed more . They felt deprived . " <p> A community largely self-organized by volunteers  --  and still full of unpaid soccer coaches and ambulance corps members  --  has private nursery schools now instead of co-ops . Two-career families do n't have time to launch institutions . The newcomers may not know the pioneers whose children are grown ; the pioneers no longer know all their neighbors , either . In these and other ways Levittown , as it gets further from its remarkable birth , has become an ordinary suburb . <p> Yet people retain extraordinary affection for the place . In the larger historical picture , government-bolstered suburbanization was a decidedly mixed blessing : It weakened cities by luring away middle-class residents ; it codified racial and economic separation ; it encouraged sprawl . Nevertheless , people here still talk of Levittown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity , " Daphne Rus calls it . <p> She remembers William Levitt at the town 's 40th anniversary celebration , riding along in a ' 64 Chevy convertible , waving to a cheering crowd . In his later years Levitt had sunk millions into failed developments , lost his fortune , run afoul of various legal authorities  --  but in Levittown he remained a hero . " There was a genuine feeling of gratitude and admiration , " Rus recalls , " because a lot of people felt he did give them and their families a chance at the good life . " <p> Quite a few of those pioneer children want to raise their own families here . With its modest lots  --  there 's a limit to how grand a Levitt house can get  --  it still offers affordable , entry-level homes . And that can still mean a step up . <p> Ed and Jessica Daniels , both children of returning vets , both lifelong Levittowners , sold their house on Rock Lane a couple of years ago . They were moving only a short distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they felt nostalgic anyway . So many barbecues and birthday celebrations and block parties during their 20 years in that little Cape . Cleaning up , on their last night in the old house , was a sad exercise . <p> What comforted Ed were all the prospective buyers . There were families fleeing cramped basement apartments , just as his own family had . A Chinese American couple and her sister . A family of Indian descent . The Danielses finally sold to an Italian American cemetery worker and his wife , who were moving out from Queens with their baby . <p> Ed and Jessica could recognize themselves and their parents in all these hopefuls drawn to Levittown . The fundamental things applied . " Most of them were looking for exactly the same things we were when we were starting out , " he says . " Young couples , usually . Newly married . They had children or planned to . They were first-time home buyers . And they aspired to something better . "
