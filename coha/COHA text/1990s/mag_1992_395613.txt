It 's Saturday night at Bubble Hill , Eddie Murphy 's sprawling party palace in New Jersey . The air crackles with expectation and tension as a cadre of people wait for Murphy to emerge from one of its myriad rooms . Murphy 's two-and-a-half-year-old daughter , Bria Liana , sits stoically atop a ping-pong table . A slender , delicate child , she looks and behaves like a miniature woman . A phalanx of retainers surround her , but she has eyes only for her mother , a Michael Jackson doll and the tall mahogany double doors that lead into Bubble Hill 's inner sanctum . When the doors finally open and Eddie Murphy emerges , there 's barely a hint of wisecracking , badass Beverly Hills Cop Axel Foley in the slender , casually elegant man who enters the room . Nor is there a glimmer of 48 Hours ' wolf-ticket-selling convict , Reggie Hammond , in Murphy 's thoughtful , modulated tones . " Bria , come to Daddy , " Eddie Murphy says and squats down . His arms open wide to catch his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter hug and grin ; they are in their own world . Forget all the other roles ; Eddie Murphy has found his golden child . " I 'm happier now , today , than I 've ever been in my life , " he says simply . Nearby , Bria 's mother , model Nicole R. Mitchell , watches the interaction between father and daughter . A thin woman with sharp features and luminous eyes , she is , at 24 , relaxed and confident . And why not ? She 's got a man she loves , a daughter she adores and a diamond on her finger that would make Liz Taylor look twice . " Bria has shown Eddie how beautiful life is . Being a father has made him more peaceful . He seems like a happier person , " says Nicole . " There 's a lot of him in her ; she 's like a little Eddie walking around . " This is not to suggest that Eddie Murphy is no longer funny . Or that he takes himself too seriously . Or that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have children , Bria 's birth has transformed Murphy 's life , both grounding and liberating him . It 's not easy to find unconditional love no matter who you are . But it 's even more difficult if , like Murphy , you 've come of age in the public eye , became one of Hollywood 's most bankable stars and grown into a corporation with dozens of employees  --  a meal ticket to many . But with the birth of his daughter , Murphy has found love at last . " When I 'm with my daughter , people cool out . There 's a calm that comes over everything because it 's all about her , " he says . " Besides , she 's a much bigger fan of Michael Jackson than she is of me . I 'm just Daddy , but Michael 's a star , " he adds with a chuckle . After a day on the set of Boomerang , a romantic comedy about a ladies ' man who gets his comeuppance , Murphy sits in his trailer in New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He feels good about the film , which is directed and produced by brothers Reginald and Warrington Hudlin of House Party fame . It is the first time Murphy has worked with an African-American director-producer team and a crew that is 50 percent Black . His third album , Love 's Alright , is coming out sometime this summer , and he 's excited about it , especially a song called " Yeah , " inspired by Bria . With guest vocals by Michael Jackson , Patti LaBelle , Luther Vandross , Jon Bon Jovi , Heavy D , En Vogue and others , the song is a kind of New Age funk paean to fatherhood . But Murphy admits that the joy of fatherhood took him by surprise . For the first year of Bria 's life , he was a frightened weekend father . " I associated the whole family thing with being older , kind of being a middle-aged person . I was holding on to my youth , " he says . " I could feel it pulling me in , but I was like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a bachelor . ' " But maybe not for long . Murphy occasionally lives with Nicole and Bria , and when asked if wedding plans are in the future to formalize what he describes as a " total , total commitment , " Murphy laughs . Then he answers cryptically , " Things are changing , and love 's alright , " echoing his new album . The couple is expecting another baby , and there is talk that a September wedding is planned . " Nicole is the sweetest person I 've ever met , and she does n't suffocate me , " says Murphy . " Women I 've been with tend to get caught up in my life ; they do n't have their own thing , they wait around for something to happen . Nicole has her own thing and she 's fine  --  makes me puff my chest all out when I 'm with her . It 's very rare that you meet a woman as fine as she is who also has a sense of humor . " But what about Raw ? Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women because they were after his money . " That was a comedy routine that people took and made serious , " says Murphy . " There 's some reality to it  --  being afraid of someone marrying you for your money , and all that shit  --  so I said it . But I got the rap for being  --  is there such a word ?  --  marriage-phobic . " Is he suspicious of women and marriage because his father was shot and killed by a woman when Murphy was a child ? " That has nothing to do with me , " Murphy says dismissively . " All I know is that a woman killed my pops , and it was n't a woman he was married to . " ( Murphy 's parents were separated at the time of the shooting . ) Murphy says that some of the early difficulty in accepting fatherhood and commitment involved reconciling and releasing these parts of his public persona . " It 's hard being someone else 's perception of what you are , " says Murphy . " Once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can get so lost trying to please so many people that you stop being true to yourself as an artist . " A few years ago Murphy realized he was n't happy  --  in spite of the celebrity , power and wealth and all the things that being Eddie Murphy brought him . " I used to play into that brooding-celebrity thing , always depressed , always upset , nothing 's right , everything 's a drag , " says Murphy . The results of his state of mind were Harlem Nights and Another 48 Hours , his least successful films . He took a year off to regain control of his life . Witnessing Bria 's birth was a major catalyst for change . Although he 'd decided not to be there , he found himself in the delivery room when Bria was born on November 18 , 1989 . " It tripped me out to see it , " he says . " A lot of cats , when they see a baby come out , they have this thing afterward where they ca n't get aroused for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , laughing that patented laugh . " But Bria put things into perspective . Staying at home and sitting on the couch playing with Nicole and the baby , that 's fun . Going to a club ? Now that 's nothing , no place . Having a family has enabled me to focus better . " But it was n't only fatherhood that cooled Eddie Murphy out . It was getting older . " I was 22 when I did Delirious . I was 25 when I did Raw . I was a kid , " says Murphy . " I ca n't even watch Raw now . When I see where my head was , when I look at myself at 25 , it 's like , " Damn , I was tripping . " I feel like my life started again on April 3 , 1991 , when I turned 30 . What happened was spiritual . I had no idea this epiphany waited for me . I thought 30 was a drag . I look at my life today , at the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realize I am so blessed . " It 's not surprising that Murphy , who has surrounded himself professionally with family and friends from his childhood home of Roosevelt , Long Island , has found affirmation in a family of his own . " Fatherhood has made me a much more serious person , more cerebral , " he says , strumming his guitar . " I used to be a loose cannon , the way I approached my future . Now I 'm really into trying to do the best work , trying to get the best scripts , because I think of my daughter all the time . She is the first person in my life whom I have a responsibility to . " Published reports to the contrary , Murphy says that Bria is his only child . Asked about rumors of other children and paternity suits , he says : " I have no other children . Those are National Enquirer babies . " He 's now looking forward to beginning filming his next movie , The Distinguished Gentleman ; after that he 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future , even though he ca n't say exactly what 's ahead  --  except more children . Definitely more children . " I 'm going to fill Bubble Hill with kids . I do n't mean to sound gushy , " he laughs , embarrassed . " But I feel everything is perfect now . Nobody 's suing me , I 've got a nice girl , a beautiful daughter , I 'm doing a movie I like . I 'm working on a killer album . " He sighs contentedly , then laughs that familiar eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh . " I 'd just like to freeze today . " Jill Nelson is an ESSENCE contributing writer . She wrote the story on Abbey Lincoln for the April issue . <p>
