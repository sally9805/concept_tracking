Section : National Affairs <p> The word conjures up heartless images . But as the welfare debate escalates in Washington , the question grows louder : is it time to take a new look at an old institution ? <p> Jimmy is real , though his real name is n't Jimmy . He is 17 and lives in a group home for troubled teens not far from New York City . The home is OK and Jimmy is OK : he 's doing well in school and intends to go to college . Jimmy is a survivor against overwhelming odds  --  and his life story , as told by Jimmy himself , proves it . <p> It all started when my father and mother met in a bar , ' Jimmy said in an autobiography written for his English class . Most relationships that start like this usually do n't turn out okay . ' This one did n't . Jimmy 's father smoked crack and drank ; his mother smoked pot . They had kids  --  three boys and a girl  --  but , as Jimmy says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would leave a pot of food on the ground and make us eat from it . While we were eating , they would both leave and go their separate ways . ' <p> The state intervened and put the kids in foster homes . Foster care can work . But Jimmy was beaten by his foster parents and moved many times to different homes . ( This period of his life is mostly a blur . ) At 9 , he was placed in a Roman Catholic home for boys . Four years later he moved in with his grandmother . Jimmy loves her , but she was very poor and the neighborhood was terrifying . After two rocky years , Jimmy wound up at the group home where he now lives . He is still at risk , and he knows it . The drugs , the drink  --  it 's in my family history , ' he says . I want to get away from it . ' <p> There are nearly 500,000 kids like Jimmy in America today , and the chaotic pattern of his young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and routinely destructive , is an example of a national dilemma that is rapidly getting worse . That is partly ( but only partly ) because the family is breaking down . Divorce and illegitimacy are up . Child abuse and child neglect are up . Proper nurture  --  by stable , responsible , loving parents  --  is increasingly hard to find . Most Americans already know this . What is new and different , and what clearly portends a fundamental shift change in America 's approach to the problem of unwanted and uncared-for kids , is our national frustration with welfare . <p> Welfare reform is a hot subject in Washington these days , and even liberals are playing the game . Now , however , the Republican majorities in both houses of Congress are escalating the debate to new and tougher levels . Essentially , the conservatives want to end welfare because they believe it fosters dependency and creates a financial incentive for young women to have babies they can not care for . The theory is clearly debatable : whatever is going through the mind of a 14-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totaling , say , $322 can not be decisive . But the Republicans are targeting welfare anyway , and that means drastic restrictions on AFDC ( Aid to Families With Dependent Children ) and potentially vast disruption in the child-welfare system that AFDC supports . Ultimately , it may very well mean resurrecting the old and long-discredited idea of The Orphanage . <p> The word sticks in the craw . It evokes the moral hypocrisies of the Victorian Age  --  its heartless distinction between the deserv-ing and the undeserving poor , its belief in harsh discipline for the young and its pious acceptance of institutional warehouses packed with pathetic waifs . Those connotations are the reason orphanages have suddenly become a red-hot partisan issue inside the Beltway  --  why Democrats demoralized by the 1994 election results are using the word to caricature the conservative approach to welfare reform and why Republicans are furiously backpedaling . It is a fact that Rep. Newt Gingrich 's newly announced welfare-reform bill would allow ( but not direct ) state governments to use federal funds to establish orphanages if they chose . And it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example  --  are jeering . We 'll mail all the Republican members of Congress a copy of Oliver Twist ' , ' Stephanopolous said recently . The orphanage idea , Hillary Rodham Clinton declared in a speech last week , is unbelievable and absurd . ' <p> But the other impulse behind the orphanage revival is the concern , now verging on panic , for the catastrophic decline of proper child-rearing practices among the poor . The alarm over single-parent families , a fixture of the welfare debate for the past 20 years , seems almost nostalgic at a time when many thousands of welfare mothers are addicted to crack . Just as heroin in the 1960s contributed to the rise of single-parent families , so will crack soon give us the no-parent child as a social problem , ' New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote in 1989 . We are likely to respond to this development by re-establishing orphanages . ' <p> In essence , Moynihan and many others argue that America must intervene to save the children of the drug-dependent poor to avert an even larger social crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that the child-welfare system is close to breaking down . Foster care is the most important case in point . The number of children in some kind of out-of-home care ' has jumped from 300,000 to at least 460,000 since 1987 , and Eileen McCaffery , executive director of the Orphan Foundation of America , says The numbers will soon overwhelm the system . ' Foster-parenting is tough , emotionally exhausting work , and the pay is lousy : between 1985 and 1990 , according to the National Foster Parent Association of America , the number of families participating dropped by 27 percent . <p> Meanwhile , the churches and private charities that operate group homes  --  today 's orphanages  --  uniformly report a huge increase in applicants and a chronic shortage of funds . Boys Town , the legendary home for troubled teens near Omaha , Neb. , says it turns down eight to nine applicants for every child it admits  --  and that the cost of housing and educating each kid now ranges from $40,000 to $48,000 a year . Father James Close , superintendent of the Mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mushrooming costs of institutional care probably dooms the movement to bring back the orphanage . Let 's say we had an unlimited budget and 5,000 Mercy Homes . So what ? They 're going to keep coming in droves  --  they 're just multiplying out there . ' Worse yet , he says , the behavior problems exhibited by kids 15 years from now are going to be far more severe . ' <p> Only very large orphanages could handle the flood . But those are the very institutions that progressives shuttered decades ago  --  and with good reason . Ronald Feldman , dean of the Columbia University School of Social Work , helped redesign Boys Town into a series of group homes in the 1970s . By and large , orphanages were n't fiscally responsible and large numbers of kids came out of them with serious problems , ' he explains . How are you going to put 500 , 800 , 1,000 kids in a large institution that is at once caring and confining ? ' says social and medical historian David Rothman . When custody meets care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be gone , the notion of the orphanage as a shelter of last resort is thriving . Now they 're called group homes  --  usually clusters of eight to 10 kids living in small houses that are more supportive , and expensive , than the spartan warehouses Gingrich 's plan evokes . Small group homes struggle to avoid the traps of their oversize predecessors . From the outside , the Worcester Group Home looks like any of the other sprawling Victorian houses lining a well-traveled street in Worcester , Mass . Inside , the atmosphere strives for the homey , though the institutional sometimes wins out . The living-room sofas are comfy , though a bit too upright ; the video library  --  Sister Act , ' E.T . '  --  is more cute than hip ; individual hygiene boxes ' for items like toothbrushes guarantee privacy . But in the hallway , a bulletin board listing laundry days and the weekly chores is a reminder that this is a community . It 's more sorority house than Mom 's house , but what distinguishes Worcester from either is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 hours a day , watching over the kids . For most , it 's the first time anyone has cared to . I came in here and did n't consider anybody my friend . I just considered them my associates , ' says Jean , 17 , slipping into pink flowered slippers and trying to sound philosophical that her closest friend , Carrie , is moving back home . <p> By the time children land in a group home , they 've usually been in the child-welfare system for years , bouncing from mother to aunts to foster homes so often that most could n't fit into a traditional family even if one would have them . These are kids whose lives have roller-coastered through the social upheavals of the ' 80s . Their mothers are often drug addicts , for whom Spock , at best , is a character on TV ; their fathers do n't exist , not even in faded photographs . Few of the kids know what it 's like to live in a house where no one yells or takes advantage of them : 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sexually abused ; 90 percent of the kids at the Mount St. Joseph-St . Elizabeth Home in San Francisco have alcohol and drug problems . Just as frightening , Half the kids are active cutters , ' says Mount St. Joseph director Mary Barry . Cutters ' refers to kids who cut their veins in suicide attempts , not cutting classes in school . <p> There are no quick fixes for broken children , only structure , consistency and love  --  the sort of things families on the verge of collapse do n't have a store of . To compensate , most group homes strive for a balance . One part is family  --  each home usually has two parent figures who live with them round the clock . The other is an almost-military devotion to cleanliness ( try to find a messy bathroom anywhere ) , orderliness ( at Worcester , 13 pairs of shoes sit in a row inside the back door ) and rules ( at Boys Town , the dress code is simple : one girl who arrived with orange-and-green hair was told to shower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' ) . The point , says Father Val J. Peter , director of Boys Town , is to teach kids how to live with others  --  and themselves . <p> Someday soon , the politicized babble in Washington will collide with the gritty and complicated realities of caring for unwanted children  --  and when it does , the politicians and policy wonks now pushing orphanages will be confronted with some very tough issues . One of them , of course , is cost . There are now nearly 9.7 million children on AFDC nationwide . If Gingrich 's welfare-reform plan were in full effect today , more than 5 million of those children would lose their financial support . Who will care for them ? Gingrich 's bill does n't say , although conservatives clearly hope the vast majority would be housed and fed by relatives . But even if that 's true , experts foresee a massive increase in the number of kids who will need someplace to go . Assume , optimistically , that four out of five welfare kids are taken in by uncles and aunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children who will need some form of institutionalized care  --  a tripling of the kiddie caseload and a massive social cost . At $100 per child per day , about average for group homes , caring for those kids would cost at least $36.5 billion . <p> Who will pay the bill ? In a recent interview , Gingrich talked in broadly optimistic terms about the need to expand private charities ' to care for those who lose their benefits under welfare reform . But David Liederman , executive director of the Child Welfare League of America , says that private philanthropy is already carrying its share of the load . About 30 percent of the cost of residential care in the United States is subsidized by charitable dollars , ' Liederman says . The homes are run by nonprofits , many of which have large endowments . There is n't a state in America that pays the actual cost of care . ' <p> Or take the custody question . Parents  --  even welfare mothers  --  have rights . Current fed-eral law , embodied in the Adoption Assistance and Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance the rights of parents with the state 's responsibility to protect children . It made family reunification ' a primary goal of the child-welfare system , which means that it limits the government 's power to take children away from their parents except in well-documented cases of neglect or abuse . Now the politicians want welfare mothers to give up their kids  --  but no one wants to give that kind of power to a welfare bureaucrat . ' Mothers  --  even unmarried , teenage mothers  --  resent those who say they should abandon their children . Patricia James is an 18-year-old mother who lives in a group home in New York City with her 2-year-old daughter Del-Sha . Would she send her daughter to an orphanage ? Del-Sha is my shadow , ' Patricia says . She 's all I 've got  --  I do n't have nobody . ' The answer is no . <p> And what about the kids ? Child-welfare advocates think the conservatives have lost sight of true family values , and they may have a point . Welfare reform , they say , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult welfare dependency that may have the side effect of forcing many thousands of children into institutional care . Get them off the dole , two years and out ? What does that mean if you 're a 2-year-old ? ' asks Carol Statuto Bevan of the National Council for Adoption . Still , almost everyone agrees that millions of kids are in jeopardy . And so the real question is : if orphanages are n't the answer , what is ? What It Costs <p> Institutional care for children is not cheap .
