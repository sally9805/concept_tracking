<p> PHILADELPHIA - Nannie Helen Burroughs ' papers were in boxes , stacked to the ceiling , when graduate student Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham entered , hungry for information . <p> It was the mid- ' 70s , a time when women 's history and black history were in vogue . But Burroughs , a black church woman , did n't fit neatly into any category . She had been largely ignored by scholars . <p> But there , packed away in a Washington , D.C. , school where Burroughs had been principal nearly 85 years before , was a hidden history in speeches , letters and meeting minutes . <p> Higginbotham had discovered the story of a turn-of-the-century Baptist feminist , one of the women who did the grass-roots work that made the church the most important agent of self-help in the black community . <p> Over the years , Higginbotham 's discovery has led to a late 1970s article , a mid- ' 80s dissertation and , most recently , to a book , as the former University of Pennsylvania history professor continues her quest to rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Higginbotham 's new book , " Righteous Discontent : The Women 's Movement in the Black Baptist Church , " 1880-1920 ( Harvard University Press ) , is the story of pioneers whose work meant literacy for the illiterate , food and clothing for the poor , and headaches for a male hierarchy not ready to acknowledge women who recognized their own power . <p> " " I was concerned about bringing the church into its central role in African-American history and larger social reform , and showing that women were responsible for that , " said Higginbotham , 48 , sitting in her office at Penn . <p> For the most part , she explained , women 's history has meant the history of the white woman . Black history has meant the history of the black man . Black church history has meant the history of black male ministers . <p> Higginbotham says she plans to help change all that . <p> The book is an extension of Higginbotham 's research on the way race has affected the understanding of gender in the African-American community , which includes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After seven years at Penn , Higginbotham is about to become a professor of Afro-American Studies and African-American Religious History at Harvard University .

Kennedy School of Government . <p> The judge says of their plans , simply , " " I will follow Evelyn . " <p> In seizing what she describes as " " an extraordinary opportunity that she did n't want to say no to , " the professor leaves Penn with only one tenured African-American woman professor in the School of Arts and Sciences . <p> At Harvard , where she will divide her time between the Divinity School and the School of Arts and Sciences , she will be the only tenured African-American woman on either school 's faculty . <p> With black women being so scarce in the ranks of tenured scholars , it is no surprise that they are nearly invisible in historical scholarship . <p> " " We do n't have adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this is critical , " said Jacquelyn Grant , founder and director of the Atlanta-based Black Women in Church and Society organization . " " I do n't think we have any other black woman historian or woman historian ( besides Higginbotham ) who has done that . So I think her work is very significant . " <p> Black church membership is at least 60 percent and sometimes more than 85 percent female . Those numbers should not be discounted , Grant and Higginbotham said . <p> " " You must look at women 's organizations and missionary and fund-raising efforts that were decisive to the success of the black church in rallying impoverished masses to establish institutions independent of white control , " Higginbotham said at a seminar on her book held recently at White Rock Baptist Church in West Philadelphia , where she is a member and also teaches an adult Sunday school class . <p> In the book , Higginbotham focuses on a period , 1880-1920 , that historians call a nadir of race relations .

They were instrumental in building schools , homes for the aged , orphanages and settlement houses . And they fought sexism to do it . <p> Grant calls them " " anyhow women .

The speech was titled " " How the sisters are hindered from helping . " <p> She was 21 at the time . <p> Some men , however , were different - men such as Higginbotham 's grandfather . <p> The Rev. Walter H. Brooks was a founding member of the National Baptist Convention and pastor of the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in Washington , D.C. , for 63 years . <p> Burroughs was a member of the church and Brooks was an unwavering supporter . He died in 1945 , the same year that Higginbotham was born . <p> " " I found pictures of him in her papers , " Higginbotham said . " " I got to know him by writing this book .
