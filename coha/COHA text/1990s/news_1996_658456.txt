<p> BESTSELLING FICTION <p> 1 . SERVANT OF THE BONES , by Anne Rice , Knopf , $ 26 <p> Anne Rice moves out of the bloody world of vampires and witches into the equally macabre domain of demons with this dreary , dismal tale . Azriel , the titular character , was a Jewish man in ancient Babylon when family and priests conspired to turn him into a demon whose primary sin is boring readers to death . A ludicrous premise is compounded by lackluster writing and a ho-hum plot accented by bits of violence and perversity . Even those who enjoy Rice 's usual creepfest will be disappointed . By Yvonne Zipp . <p> 2 . THE LAST DON , by Mario Puzo , Random House , $ 25.95 <p> After more than 20 years , Mario Puzo returns to the familiar territory of " The Godfather " and the mafiosi . He weaves an intricate and compelling plot , often told with humor , that involves some 35 characters crisscrossing each other 's lives . Puzo underscores and foreshadows his theme : Don Clericuzio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move into legitimate businesses . His path is strewn with corpses , sex , gambling , and betrayal . It is set largely in Las Vegas and Hollywood . By Suman Bandrapalli . <p> 3 . CAUSE OF DEATH , by Patricia Cornwell , Putnam , $ 25.95 <p> Chalk up the weak story line of Cornwell 's latest to multiple book contracts by a best-selling author . The takeover of a nuclear power plant by a religious cult and the hostage-rescue finale strain credulity . Cornwell 's continued slide into blatant and trite political correctness dessicates character development and contorts the plot . Her trademark forensic scenes are n't enough to redeem cliche-riddled , male-chauvinist police and Scarpetta 's wonder-woman lesbian niece . By Jim Bencivenga . <p> 4 . THE RUNAWAY JURY , by John Grisham , Doubleday , $ 26.95 <p> This book has it all : mystery , legal maneuvering , behind-the-scenes views of a trial , jury tampering , and plenty of other skullduggery . Taking a page from today 's headlines , Grisham takes us to Biloxi , on Mississippi 's Gulf Coast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial . Both sides are trying to fix the jury , but that panel seems to have a mind of its own . Grisham draws a finely detailed , realistic picture of the action and the characters . By Lawrence J. Goodrich . <p> 5 . THE TENTH INSIGHT , by James Redfield , Warner , $ 19.95 <p> Redfield 's sequel to his successful bestseller " Celestine Prophecy , " is also a poorly written , thinly disguised allegory . The book centers around the discovery of a 10th Insight that he says is necessary for " implementing these Insights , living them , ... fulfilling destiny " ( and selling more books ) . Redfield dabbles in spiritual healing , reincarnation , energy levels , and dimensional travel . There are glimmers of - forgive the pun - insight , but the whole is a mishmash of religion and new-age thinking . By Yvonne Zipp . <p> 6 . THE CELESTINE PROPHECY , by James Redfield , Warner , $ 17.95 <p> Well-intended but poorly written , the plot is a cross between " Indiana Jones " and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recently discovered Peruvian manuscript that details the progress of spirituality at the end of the 20th century . At different stages of the journey , he and his fellow searches discover spiritual " insights , " nine in total . Rather than profound , the book is awash in such cliches such as the need to " become conscious of the coincidences in our lives . " By Yvonne Zipp . <p> 7 . LILY WHITE , by Susan Isaacs , HarperCollins $ 25 <p> Susan Isaacs creates heroines who are tough , funny , and vulnerable , and so real that within a few pages of dialogue readers find themselves talking back . " Lily White " is a tough criminal defense lawyer in New York who now calls herself Lee White . She alternately tells her own life story and that of her current case , involving a love ' em and rob ' em con man accused of murdering his latest victim . Every social detail , every cultural nuance is exactly right , from this gifted and generous writer . By Michelle Ross . <p> 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McMillan , Viking , $ 23.95 <p> People who enjoyed McMillan 's 1992 bestseller " Waiting to Exhale " may want to skip this surprisingly uneven follow-up . Gone are the well-drawn characters and storylines from the previous book , the author 's third . Instead , readers get a tensionless tale about a black divorcee in her 40s and her relationship with a Jamaican man half her age . Besides its weak plot ( based on events in the author 's life ) , the novel features one-dimensional characters and often wince-worthy dialogue . By Kim Campbell . <p> 9 . EXCLUSIVE , by Sandra Brown , Warner , $ 22.95 <p> The latest novel by this thriller/romance writer follows freelance journalist Barrie Travis as she uncovers scandal in the White House following the presumed crib death of the first child . While the characters are interesting and some nice plot twists keep the action compelling , the subject matter is somewhat unpleasant and the language can be less than polite . Mental illness , spousal abuse , and murder figure prominently in a story that could be more respectful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GODS AND GENERALS , by Jeffrey M. Shaara , Ballantine , $ 25 <p> This wonderfully engrossing book follows four Civil War personalities - Confederate Gens . Robert E. Lee and Thomas " Stonewall " Jackson and Union officers Winfield Scott Hancock and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain - in their transformation from prewar soldiers and scholars into wartime heroes . The characterization is fascinating and insightful . It 's a novel , but one resting on events that surpassed anything anyone could have imagined - including the principals in this narrative . By Keith Henderson . <p> 11 . PRIMARY COLORS , by Anonymous , Random House , $ 24 <p> Scratch the surface of this novel about Southern governor Jack Stanton 's campaign for president and you 'll find Bill Clinton . And wife , Hillary . And a host of other political types who are cleverly fictionalized by the book 's mysterious author ( who denies that the characters and events are real ) . Deducing who 's who and following the ins and outs of primaries make this an interesting read , but subplots and lengthiness weigh it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sexual situations . By Kim Campbell . <p> 12 . CADILLAC JUKEBOX , by James Lee Burke , Hyperion $ 22.95 <p> There are 49 states and Louisianna . Burke 's vision of the new South , however well he crafts a metaphor , leaves one canceling plans for a trip to Mardi Gras . Deputy sheriff Dave Robicheaux lives in the Cajun wetlands of Iberia Parish where familiar , yet dangerous creatures slither , crawl , swim and stand up on two legs in a complicated , improbable plot - racist poor-white-trash , decadent scion of an old Southern family , Mafia princess , steamy sex , Mexican drugs , and violent murders . By Jim Bencivenga . <p> 13 . THE FOURTH ESTATE , by Jeffery Archer , HarperCollins , $ 26 <p> Fast-paced , thinly disguised fictionalization of the rise and fall of media baron Robert Maxwell - intertwined with the rise and near fall of maxwell 's successful global competitor , Rupert Murdoch . Seven decades of history , destructive chutzpah , clever business strategy , and outsized egos are on parade . Archer is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forebears , Disraeli and churchill . His hallmark : seamless interweaving of action and thinking , realistic characters . By Earl Foell . <p> 14 . PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD , by Faye Kellerman , William Morrow , $ 23 <p> This murder mystery reads like a Religion 101 course - where no faith fares too well . While the writing is strong and somewhat stylish , the content is unpleasant and freighted with stereotypes against Christian fundamentalists . The plot expends itself on a tangle of religious fundamentalism , a son 's conversion to the Roman Catholic priesthood , an investigating detective 's Orthodox Jewish wife , a pack of bikers , and the bigoted , grisly murder of three homosexuals . The resolution is tawdry . By Terri Theiss . <p> 15 . A LITTLE YELLOW DOG , by Walter Mosley , W.W. Norton , $ 23 <p> The time is 1963 . The place is Los Angeles . Easy Rawlins has an honest , real-paying job for the first time in his life as a school custodial superintendent . His slide from conventional security begins with one quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . One minute he 's holding her , the next minute he 's holding her " little rat dog , " and he 's back in his former world of murder , lies , drugs and extortion . Moments of painful insight segue confidently into bits of dry humor . By Michelle Ross . <p> *Bestseller rankings from Publishers Weekly , August 12 , 1996 <p> MONITOR 'S PICK <p> COMMUNION , Edited by David Rosenberg , Anchor Books , 547pp. , $ 30 <p> In " Communion , " the spiritual successor to " Congregation , " an earlier volume in which Jewish authors wrote of their relationship to the Hebrew Bible , poet and editor David Rosenberg has gathered another series of essays on the Bible . <p> They are written not by Biblical commentators and scholars but by 36 living fiction authors , literary critics , and poets , mostly Americans , mostly raised Christian . " Communion , " like its predecessor , strives for a new way of reading and writing about Bible stories and poetry . <p> Rosenberg asked writers to peel away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translators impose on Biblical writings . What he wants readers to have is an " unmediated experience with the Bible " as a human text . " Communion , here , has to do with writers getting in direct contact with their Biblical counterparts , listening to the ancient voices , then writing from their own life experiences with Bible texts . <p> Churches and theologies are important and influential to these writers as context for growing up . But whether Protestant , Roman Catholic , Hindu , or Mormon , they describe their religions ( sometimes with disconcerting candor ) as unchosen accidents of birth . No writer , however alienated from organized religion , speaks disrespectfully of the Bible . Many of the essays are intensely personal and resonate with all the vividness and subjectivity of remembered childhood . The best essays use memory to embrace ideas and spiritual themes that transcend the merely personal .
