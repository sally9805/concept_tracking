Sometimes I think it began the day I came into the world . Sometimes I feel certain I was born to follow him through the mountains , follow him in desperate chase until he had beaten me and I was dead on my feet . The Still Run Buck , we called him , and there was never another deer like him . <p> He was a massive , magnificent twelve-pointer and he walked like a king . Bucks in our Southern mountains seldom run as heavy as two hundred pounds . The Still Run Buck must have weighed considerably over two hundred . But I do n't know for sure , because I never weighed him . I stood at last with my hand on his lifeless head , but I never weighed him . <p> Maybe I 'm wrong and it did n't begin the day I was born . Let 's say it began the day I broke with my father . That was the day I rode a bus the ninety-six miles from the city to the place we called the Crossroads . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding road climbed from the Crossroads toward the blue , wonderful mountains beyond Swain 's farm in the valley of Swain 's Run . <p> I walked every step of the seven long miles to Henry Swain 's mailbox . There I turned my back on the highway and followed the narrow road dropping off the ridge to the valley below . It was late afternoon of a hot day in September and T was eighteen years old , tall enough for my age , but skinny , with blue eyes and darkish hair , and my name was Jim Hastings . <p> Long before I reached the house I was breathing hard , from excitement rather than exertion . It was a solid , weathered old frame house that had started out long ago as a log cabin . It was not much to look at , I suppose , but it was a comfortable place and had about it an unmistakable air of welcome . I began to walk very fast and the two Irish setters raised a tremendous clamor and then raced to meet me when I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . <p> Suddenly I was scared , afraid he would n't let me stay . Stooping to pet the dogs , I delayed coming face to face with him . But I heard his solid footsteps . <p> " I was just thinking about you , boy , " he said . " Thinking about you and your pa . Where 's he at ? " <p> " Home , " I told him . " He did n't come . " <p> " How 'd you get here ? " <p> " Bus to the Crossroads and walked the rest of the way . I-I came to stay , Mr. Swain . " <p> " You what ? " he asked me in that gentle voice of his . <p> " I came to stay for good , if you 'll let me . " <p> He knew this was no time to bid me a conventional welcome . For a while he said nothing at all , which was his way when he was in doubt . His gray eyes studied me . He was a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endurance for a man of sixty . Behind him was a long line of good and self-sufficient stock . His people had dwelt here a long time . The stream beyond the house bore his name , as did the gap in the mountains to the west . <p> He was no hillbilly . He had fought in France in the first World War and had later followed construction work before coming home to the mountains . His education had been sketchy , but he knew his way around and he was respected wherever he went . <p> " Boy , did you run away from home ? " <p> " No , sir . I just  --  left . " <p> " Your daddy 's a good man , Jim , and Mrs. Hastings  --  Now a stepmother never is exactly the same as a real mother , no matter what they say , but your stepmother is a kind and gracious lady . " <p> " Yes , sir , " I said . " She cried when I left . She  --  she even tried to reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breath . Frank 's not easy to reason with sometimes . You 're going to be exactly like him . Come over here , Jim , and tell me what happened . " <p> I followed him to a wooden bench under a locust tree and sat down beside him . I was more afraid than ever . The dogs licked my hands . In the field across Swain 's Run a mother quail called to her brood . I could smell ham frying in the kitchen and coffee boiling and biscuits baking . I took a long , deep breath and told him . <p> When I finished , he said : " Let 's see if I 've got it all straight . The main thing is your pa lost his temper when you told him you did n't intend to go to college this fall . That 's right , ai n't it ? He said some pretty hard things to you and you said some right back at him . In a little while was n't neither one of you fit to talk to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's got a grown man 's good sense on his side ? " <p> " I do n't care , " I said . " I 'm not ever going to school again . I 'm sick of books . I never want to see another book . I just want to live here in the mountains . I 've wanted to live here ever since the first time my father brought me up here hunting when I was twelve years old . " <p> " I remember , " he said . " I recollect all the times you and your pa come here hunting . I 'll never forget how proud me and Frank were when we found out you had a natural-born knack for tracking a wild thing in the woods . You and him shake hands when you walked out ? " <p> " N-no , sir , but he made me take a hundred dollars . " <p> " I reckon he 's a mighty disappointed man right now . You do n't belong to live here , Jim . You belong to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daddy and come up here once a year and hunt with me and Jay and Paul . " I started to speak , but he shut me up with one uplifted hand . " But you 're too young to see you 're making a fool of yourself . Well ! If you 've got to make a fool of yourself , the time to do it is when you 're young . You make a fool of yourself at my age or your daddy 's and it 's liable to be real serious . In your case  --  why , you wo n't hardly notice it . " <p> That was the longest speech I ever heard him make . He closed his hands , lacing the fingers together , opened his hands and stared at them . Finally he spoke again . <p> " Just what did you have in mind , boy ? " <p> " I can help you on the farm , now that Jay and Paul are married and living in homes of their own . At the end of the year you can pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This fall in my spare time I can guide hunters the way you used to when you were a young man . " <p> He shook his head . " Not this fall . You ai n't woodsman enough yet . Oh , you 're a good tracker , like I said , but  --  " <p> I cut him short . " I 'll kill the Still Run Buck ! I 'll show you ! If I hunt the Still Run Buck down and kill him , will you think I 'm a woodsman then ? " <p> His eyes twinkled . " I 'd be powerful impressed . " <p> " Can I stay ? " I asked him , with my heart pounding . <p> " You can stay , " he told me . " We 'll see how it works out . Now let 's go wash up for supper . " <p> He led me to the kitchen , where his wife , whom I always called Miss Molly , made me welcome . She was one of the kindest persons I ever knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grouse . In as few words as possible Mr. Swain acquainted her with the situation . <p> " Right after supper , Henry , " she said instantly , " you get in that pickup truck and drive down to the Crossroads and call Mr. Hastings on the long-distance telephone and tell him Jim 's here . " <p> " No , " Henry Swain said firmly . " This thing is a thing between me and Jim . " He looked at me . " Jim is going to write his pa a letter , and what telling is done  --  why , he can do it in that letter . " <p> " But , Henry ! " she protested . <p> " I told you this was between me and Jim . " <p> He smiled at me then , and I have never since been as grateful to anyone as I was to Henry Swain at that shining moment of my life . <p> I did write the letter . Later , after Mr. Swain and Miss Molly had gone to bed . It took me an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized the truth of Mr. Swain 's contention that I was very young , because I cried the last thirty minutes . But the next morning the sun shot the mountains full of golden light and I was strong again . <p> It was a boy 's dream there at the farm on Swain 's Run . A dream for a boy who hated the city , who all his life had loved the out-of-doors , who had read endlessly of mountains and mountain men , who used to feel he had been born too late . It was a dream that was not to end until the Still Run Buck lay dead at my feet . <p> I saw him the second morning I was there . I was up at daylight looking for a steer that had strayed the day before and I saw the Still Run Buck in a little meadow half a mile below Still Run 's junction with Swain 's Run . He stood erect and looked at me . He stamped one forefoot and actually took three or four steps toward me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but proudly as if he owned the earth . Then he snorted , wheeled , hoisted his flag , and ran with unbelievable speed for the hemlocks at the foot of the ridge . <p> Forgetting the steer , I charged back to the house . " I saw him ! " I shouted . " I saw him ! I saw the Still Run Buck ! " <p> Henry Swain smiled understandingly and did not chide me about the steer . I do n't think he ever chided me . He was a patient man and I was a willing student . I loved the work on the farm and it did not take me long to catch on . <p> " You learn real quick , " he used to say . <p> I milked the cows and fed the hogs . I made hay in the meadow , and when the time came I cut corn on the hillsides . I mended fence and helped cut and saw and store firewood against the winter . Some of it was hard work and some of it was easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do with survival . <p> My stepmother wrote to me regularly and I had one letter from my father , in answer to the one I had written him . It was a blunt and honest letter . He was glad I liked it at Swain 's . He was sorry I felt I had to do what I was doing . He would not be coming to the mountains to hunt that fall . If I changed my mind I was to come home at once and we would take up where we had left off . It was typical of him that he said if I changed my mind and not when . <p> Time went by on wings . Suddenly all the corn was cut and all the firewood stored and the last of the small grain seeded . It was the middle of November and the hunting season was at hand . Jay and Paul , Henry Swain 's two sons , came from their homes to hunt with us the first day . We went turkey hunting and Mr. Swain and Paul each got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That night at supper I said , " Tomorrow I am going to hunt the Still Run Buck . " <p> Jay and Paul laughed outright at me , but Henry Swain silenced them with one look . " I expect Jim would come as close to hunting that old heathen down as either one of you would . " <p> Later , when Jay and Paul had gone home , he led me into what was called the front room . He lit the fire in the fireplace and we sat down , stretching our legs out to the blaze , helping our muscles relax after the day 's long tramp . It was a pleasant , rewarding time and for a long while we said nothing . <p> " That buck is on your mind , ai n't he ? " Henry Swain said at last . " He 's like a fever with you . Why , boy ? " <p> " I just want him . That 's one reason . The other reason is that you said I was n't a woodsman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't enough of a woodsman yet to go guiding city hunters through these mountains . " <p> " Amounts to the same thing , " I told him . " I have got to kill the Still Run Buck to show you . " <p> He shot me a direct and searching look . " You think being a good woodsman is more important than being a good lawyer ? " <p> " I 'd rather be a good woodsman than a good lawyer . " <p> " You figure you got a chance against that old buck ? " <p> " I aim to find out . " <p> " He knows it 's hunting season now . He wo n't stand in the meadow and look at you . He 'll be long gone . You think I do n't know ? You think I never hunted him ? Well , I did . Many and many a weary day . I walked him down once and then missed him because I was too tired to hold the rifle steady . " <p> A sudden suspicion crystallized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want him killed , do you ? You  --  you 'd rather I did n't try for him , would n't you ? " <p> He shook his head . " You 're welcome to try . It 's a good thing for a man to want something the way you want that buck . But you 're going to cry in your sleep before you get him . " <p> I was out at daybreak the next morning and I spent the entire day scouring the ridges and the hollows along Still Run . I saw other deer , but I never glimpsed the Still Run Buck . Nor did I jump him the second day . I dragged home that night tired to the bone , and fell asleep at the supper table . <p> The third day I did jump him . He was bedded down less than a hundred yards from where Still Run and Swain 's Run joined . There was a violent crashing in the brush ahead and I glimpsed him long enough to identify him . There was no mistaking his magnificent rack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the sounds of his headlong flight died out and then picked up his trail . It was not too hard to track him in the hollow ; but when he took to the ridge , I lost the trail . It had not rained for weeks and the higher ground was hard and unyielding , and only the keenest of trackers could have followed him there . I began to cut wide circles , hoping to find him bedded down again and get in a lucky shot before he crashed away . I did n't find him . <p> The fourth day I jumped him again and lost him again . The fifth day it rained and rained and rained . I tramped the ridges and the hollows all day in the rain and found no sign of the buck . Again I was tired to the bone , but it never occurred to me to quit . <p> I think that by now I hated him . I know that showing Henry Swain was no longer important . Maybe I just had to show myself . However it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand over him and know that at last he was mine . A desperate urgency kept me going . <p> Then , less than an hour before nightfall , I jumped him and he fled through the drowned woods like a jet-powered wraith . I threw the rifle to my shoulder , but I was too late ; and it was too late to follow him . I had to find the trail leading off that ridge before dark set in . <p> I found the trail and followed it home . I entered by way of the kitchen . Miss Molly gave me a troubled look . There was no expression on Henry Swain 's face . I walked past them without a word , went to my room , and shucked out of my soaked clothes . When I reopened the door , I heard them talking in the kitchen . <p> " Are you going to stop that fool boy or not ? " Miss Molly demanded . <p> " Who am I to stop him ? " Henry Swain asked her . " This is something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd stop him if I could . This thing has got to go to a finish , one way or another . " <p> After supper we sat before the fire in the front room and listened to the beat of the rain . I did n't tell him anything about that day 's hunt and he did n't ask me . But finally he made the suggestion that I sleep late the next morning . I shook my head at him . <p> " I 'm going again , rain or no rain . " <p> " Tomorrow is Sunday , " he reminded me softly . <p> So I rested the next day and the rain came down all day long . But Monday morning the stars were out when I went into the kitchen to fix my breakfast . I found it already fixed and a lunch packed for me . Henry Swain had done this and he was sitting at the table waiting for me . <p> " You 'll have a good day , " he told me . " The ground will be soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 've got the patience . Look ! I promised myself I 'd stay out of this . I promised myself faithful I would n't help you . I figured you 'd hunt him three or four days and then quit . " <p> " I 'll never quit . " <p> He nodded . " That 's why I 'm going to tell you how to get him . " I stared at him , but I did n't say a word . " It 's the way I done the day I shot at him and missed three years ago . You can get him , boy , if you 're man enough to walk him down . " <p> " Walk him down ? " <p> Again he nodded . " It 's an old trick of mine and it 'll work a day like this , when the ground 's soft enough for tracking . If you 're lucky enough to jump him , just keep on his trail . Do n't let him rest a minute longer than you can help . He 'll run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bed down again . Follow his trail as fast as you can and roust him out and keep him moving all day long . Even a deer gets tired , the same as a man . " <p> " Did that ever work for you ? " I demanded . <p> " Lots of times with other deer , and it worked once with the Still Run Buck , only I missed him . " <p> Over my shoulder I slung the beautiful .30-06 my father had given me two years before and which my stepmother had packed and sent to me when I wrote for it . I struck off up Swain 's Run toward Still Run . It was dawn in the valley , but sunrise on the top of Eagle Knob , miles to the west . I was lucky that morning . He had n't bedded down yet . He was standing at the edge of the little meadow below the mouth of Still Run . Dropping to one knee , I wished for scope sights ; but Henry Swain and my father always used iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the gun to my shoulder . At that moment , before I could aim , the Still Run Buck saw me , bounded into the brush , and , as Henry Swain had said , was gone like the wind . <p> But he had left an easy trail in the wet ground of the flat . His enormous weight had driven his hoofs deep . Nor , when he took to the ridge , was his trail too hard to follow . A little way up the ridge he had stopped his wild flight and had begun to walk . I made my way stealthily and noiselessly . Today there were no dry leaves to betray me . He would have to sight me or wind me . <p> Finally I found where he had stood a while and then walked on with shorter and shorter steps . I stopped beside a slim hemlock and scanned the brush ahead . A grouse twittered in a thicket . Far up the ridge a wild turkey yelped once . <p> The buck was near . The tracks indicated that he considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I peered into the brush , my heart racing , my knees shaking . There was only a little wind , scarcely more than a breeze , but enough for me to feel it when it changed . It was cool at the back of my neck now instead of in my face , and instantly the buck broke from his bed no more than thirty yards away . But again he vanished before I could lay the sights on him . <p> This time he did not go far . Why , I do n't know . Perhaps he figured it was only luck that I had stumbled on him again . This time he did not break into crashing flight , but skulked away . I found where he had lain down and then , at my approach , had got up and gone quietly away from there . <p> That flight was his longest . The tracks showed that he ran at least a mile along the top of the ridge and then walked another two miles at a steady gait . It was as if he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake me off his trail . <p> But he was out of luck . On this higher ground the trail was not as plain as it had been below , but the tracks were there if you had the patience to search them out . Finally , three miles from where he had skulked away , I jumped him again , and this time it seemed to me there was a kind of desperation in his going . He made twice as much noise in the thick brush as he had made before . Maybe he thought to frighten me with his tremendous racket , maybe he meant to show me that he had energy to waste and in that way convince me it was useless to follow him . <p> " Run , you hellion ! " I called after him . " Run till your legs fall off ! You ca n't lose me ! " <p> He ran only a few hundred yards that time and then settled to a steady walk . As far as I know , he did not lie down again that day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and he would not lie down and risk being surprised in his bed . But the tracks showed countless places where he stopped and waited and then went on again when evidently he either glimpsed or winded me . The tracks showed , too , that he was not as fresh as he had been . <p> Neither was I. The steady climbing  --  the buck had traveled in almost a straight line toward Bluetop  --  had burned a lot of my energy . My thighs were sore and my calf muscles hurt . Oftener and oftener I had to stop and catch my breath . <p> Noon came and I ate half my lunch and went on again . I was tired . I felt as if I had never been fresh . Sweat ran down my face and down my flanks from my armpits . But at the same time I was happy and eager and filled with hope . Because it was going to work . Henry Swain had been right . I could walk him down . Sooner or later he would lag just enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to work ! <p> But it did n't . At least it did n't for a long and desperate time . Once , about mid-afternoon , I saw him clearly for an instant . This was on a thinly wooded hogback . He was standing still , looking back over his shoulder at the way he had come . We saw each other at the same time and he was gone instantly . <p> From there he climbed steadily to the foot of Bluetop and then turned directly north across the ridges between Bluetop and Eagle Knob . These were wild , steep ridges with deep and rocky hollows lying between . He was dragging his feet now and stopping oftener , and the tracks indicated that he was not too far ahead of me . But I could n't gain . I lost ground every time I reached the top of a ridge , because I had to stop and take the pressure off my lungs . <p> " Wait for me ! " I remember saying as I climbed the almost sheer side of the deepest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time ! " <p> I halted at the top of the ridge and lay on the ground , panting . The sun was going down over Bluetop . Already the hollows were dim with shadows . Sweat trickled into my eyes . Suddenly I knew that it was n't going to work . The Still Run Buck might be about as near dead on his feet as I was , but he had the advantage of that distance between us . <p> I knew something else too : that if I did n't get him today I never would . He would never give me another beating like the one he had given me today over the miles and miles and miles that lay behind us . Still , at that moment I wanted him more than I had ever wanted him . I staggered to my feet . If it was ever going to happen , it had to happen in the next forty or fifty minutes . <p> This was the last ridge before Eagle Knob . I picked my way down it and came not to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut by numerous ravines . He was walking slowly now and stopping every few yards . I fell over a rock and got up . The last of the sunlight died , and as it died I saw him . <p> He was standing broadside not more than sixty yards from me , standing at the edge of a ravine , testing the air with his flared nostrils . The wind had changed and blew now from him to me and he was nervous about that . But he was an old , wise buck and he would make no break until he knew what he was doing . <p> " There you are ! " I heard myself whisper . <p> I wiped the sweat from my eyes and brought the rifle up . Henry Swain had been too tired to hold steady . I was tired , too , but not that tired . The butt came to rest against my shoulder . I sighted on him and squeezed the trigger and knew that at the last possible moment excitement or desire or some other deadly force had betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward . As tired as he must have been , it was a magnificent leap , but it was n't enough . He did not quite clear the ravine . His forefeet struck the far edge and clawed frantically for a purchase . His hind feet dug at the sheer side of the ravine . Then he fell backward and out of my sight . <p> For a moment I stood rooted and then I ran for the ravine . It was a forty-foot drop to the bottom and I slid down in a cascade of gravel and small stones . He lay at the very bottom and his neck was broken . That was when I stood with my hand on his lifeless head . <p> Suddenly it was as unbelievable as if my father or Henry Swain lay dead at my feet . Just as suddenly the hate that had been born of his mastery over me was gone . I had walked him down and yet at the very end he had beaten me , only to lose his life by a cruel accident . I wished now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravine and with some last reserve of energy gone bounding away from me forever . <p> I touched him again , gently , my hand trembling . Then I picked my way down the ravine to a point where I could climb out . It was now too late to try to find my way home . I would have to spend the night in the woods . At the foot of Eagle Knob I found an overhang of rock , gathered enough firewood to last the night , and built a fire in front of the overhang . <p> At first I was too exhausted to eat , but finally I put down the half of my lunch I had saved . I stretched out under the overhang and closed my eyes . From time to time I dozed , and from time to time I got up and put fresh wood on the fire . Once I heard a noise and I stumbled through the dark to make sure no varmint was at the carcass of the Still Run Buck . <p> Daylight came finally . I stamped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and headed north for Swain 's Gap . The highway ran through the gap and it was only an hour 's walk from Eagle Knob . When I reached the highway I turned east and presently a man came along in a car and gave me a ride . I got out at Swain 's mailbox and plodded down the ridge to the house . <p> " I was n't worried about you , " Henry Swain said . " I knew you could take care of yourself if you had to spend the night in the woods . Jim ! What 's the matter , boy ? " <p> " He 's dead , " I told him . " The Still Run Buck . He 's dead " <p> " You got him ? You sure-enough got him ! " <p> " No . I missed him . But he tried to jump a ravine and did n't make it and fell forty feet on his back and broke his neck . He beat me ! I walked him down and he still beat me ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He done that to me too . " <p> " Were you  --  were you glad you  --  missed him ? " <p> " I think I was , boy . Yes , I was glad . " <p> " I did n't have time to be glad ! He was dead before I had time to be glad ! " <p> " But you would n't been ? " He put his hand on my shoulder . " Breakfast 's waiting for you , Jim . " <p> " Will you help me get him out of the woods ? He 's in that deepest ravine at the foot of Eagle Knob . " <p> He nodded . " There 's an old road runs back in there . We can get the pickup within a mile of the knob . A buck as old as he was  --  well , I doubt if the meat will be worth the trouble , but of course , you want to have his head mounted . " <p> " No , " I said . <p> " Then you just want his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head at him . " I want to bury him . I want to bury him in that little meadow below Still Run where he used to come out and feed . " <p> He did n't think I was crazy . He just looked at me as one man at another . " I see , " he said . He studied me a moment and I saw by his eyes that something had occurred to him . " You go in and eat your breakfast . I have got to run down to the Crossroads , but I will be back by the time you 're done . Then we 'll go get him . " <p> It took us a long time to drag him out of the ravine and a longer time to carry him to the pickup . We lashed his forefeet together and then his hind feet and we carried him out on a pole . On the ride back to the farm neither of us said a word . <p> We buried him in the little meadow . We dug his grave deep so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth solidly above him and we put rocks from the ridge on his grave . We did the best we could for him , because he had been a king and a king deserves the very best . <p> Afterward we walked slowly , side by side , to the pickup and climbed in . Henry Swain started the motor . I did not look back . I looked ahead , knowing now that I had to go home . That was where I belonged . I could still enroll for the university 's second term , which began in February . I would come back every year to hunt with Henry Swain , but now I had to go home . <p> There was no clear-cut symbol involved . It was simply that I had come through an emotional experience probably more profound , in its way , than any I would ever know again , and in the coming through had grown older . Without the Still Run Buck I would have matured anyway . In time I would have realized that my place was not here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my advantages and of whatever talents were mine . The Still Run Buck had simply taken me the short way home , sudden and violent and painful and at the same time as involved as a thing could be . <p> A familiar car stood parked at the house and my father sat at the kitchen table talking with Miss Molly . He shook hands with me and with Henry Swain . Then he shook hands with me again . I remembered the light in Henry Swain 's eyes when he had said he had to go down to the Crossroads that morning . <p> " You sent for him , " I said . " You called him long-distance from the Crossroads . " <p> " Yes , I done that , " Henry Swain said . " It seemed like a right good thing to do . " <p> " I came as fast as I could , " my father said . " Lord , Jim , you 've put on at least ten pounds and you 're as brown as a chestnut . " <p> He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me again . Somehow I sensed that he was going to ask me to go back with him . I did n't let him . I beat him to it . I said , " I was coming home tomorrow . But maybe , since you 're here , we could leave this afternoon . " <p> " We can leave the minute you 're ready , " he told me . <p> I went to my room and packed . Then I stood at the window and looked at the mountains . The sunlight was bright on Bluetop and Eagle Knob and all the ridges between , brighter than gold on all the places where the Still Run Buck had roamed . <p>
