THE ROSWELL FILES <P> " The only thing more incredible than extraterrestrials ' visiting Earth is the U.S. government 's denying that they exist . " GARY OSTROW Fort Lauderdale , Fla . <P> For believers , the strange events at Roswell , N.M . SOCIETY , June 23 , represent the core of a vast panoply of beliefs in the same fashion that Christ does for Christians . Both claim to make sense out of senselessness . Videos of recent events and countless photos of wingless and bladeless craft , as well as the physical marks left on abductees , support the Roswell belief . DOUG PARRISH Howell , Mich . <P> The " alien " on your cover  --  with its predictable oversize head and creepy doe eyes  --  prompted one of my pet peeves : illustrations of extraterrestrial creatures that look just like humans . Get real ! We humans are the product of a host of improbable accidents . Science tells us that space and life are weird beyond belief . And so are real aliens . ALAN M. PERLMAN Highland Park , Ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Showtime film Roswell , I believe you are wrong to be dismissive of Philip J. Corso 's book The Day After Roswell . It is the most important breakthrough on UFOs in a half-century . Here is an author who served as part of President Eisenhower 's National Security Council , has 19 medals and has let the genie out of the bottle on the UFO cover-up . Corso gives the best justification for secrecy about the Roswell Incident ever offered . <P> Those who kept the secret and lied repeatedly to the public to hide the technological manna from heaven end up looking omniscient and justified . He shows how America 's interests were served for decades by publicly stonewalling the UFO issue while achieving , in total secrecy , the scientific breakthroughs that literally define our modern world . The debris from the Roswell crash was not manufactured on Earth . PAUL DAVIDS Los Angeles <P> Does the U.S. Air Force really think people will accept the explanation that its high-altitude balloons dropped dummies that did not in any way resemble human beings but just happened to be 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEE SCHOR Arlington Heights , Ill . <P> Your poll showed that 13% of Americans believe intelligent beings from other planets have been in contact with members of the U.S. government . I think the numbers would have been higher if you had asked people if they thought U.S. government officials were from another planet . Why would E.T.s want to speak to anyone in our government ? MARE MEYER Los Angeles <P> I usually take my copy of your magazine with me to lunch when I privately indulge in reading the tabloids ( the Star , the National Enquirer , etc . ) . I use TIME to cover my other reading material so that no one will know my secret . The Roswell cover did n't provide much of a disguise . What 's next ? Elvis sightings ? STORMY JADE WONG Lawndale , Calif . <P> Anyone who believes that humans are the only intelligent life-form in the universe is ignorant and narrow-minded . Since we can achieve space travel , we can conclude that in this vast universe others have also done so , and that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to reach other solar systems . There are a lot of people out there who are lying and just trying to make a buck from this phenomenon , but there is also validity . GENE PATTERSON Palmetto , Ga .
