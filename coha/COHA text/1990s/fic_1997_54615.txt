They 're free to run anywhere they like whenever they like , so they do . The land falls away from their small house on the hill along a prickly path ; there 's a dirt road , a pasture where the steer are kept , swamps , a gully , groves of fruit trees , and then the creek from whose far bank a wooded mountain surges  --  they climb it . At the top , they step out to catch their breaths in the light . The mountain gives way into fields as far as their eyes can see  --  alfalfa , soybean , corn , wheat . They are n't sure where their own land stops and someone else 's begins , but it does n't matter , they 're told . It does n't matter Go where you please ! <p> They spend their whole lives in trees , young apple trees and old tired ones , red oaks , walnuts , the dogwood when it flowers in May . ' ? hey hold leaves up to the light and peer through them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leaves and wait for that feeling of darkness to come and make their whole bodies stir . They discover locust shells , tree frogs , a gypsy moth 's cocoon . Now they know what that sound is in the night when the tree frogs sing out at the tops of their lungs . In the fields , they collect groundhog bones . They make desert piles and bless them with flowers and leaves . They wish they could be plants and lie very still near the ground all night and in the morning be covered with tears of dew . They wish they could he Robin Hood , Indians . In the summer , they rub mud all over their bodies anti sit out in the sun to let it dry . When it dries , they stand up slowly like old men and women with wrinkled skin and walk stifflimbed through the trees towards the creek . <p> Their parents do n't care what they do . They 're the luckiest children alive ! They run out naked in storms . They go riding on ponies with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . They take baths with their father , five bodies in one tub . In the pasture , they stretch out flat on their backs and wait for the buzzards to come . When the buzzards start circling , they lie very still , breathless with fear , and imagine what it would be like to be eaten alive . That one 's diving ! they say , and they leap to their feet . No , we 're alive ! We 're alive ! <p> The children all sleep in one room . Their parents built the house themselves , four rooms and four stories high , one small room on top of the next . With their first child , a girl , they lived out in a tent in the yard beneath the apple trees . In the children 's room , there are three beds . The girls sleep together and the youngest boy in a wooden crib which their mother made . A toilet stands out in the open near the stairwell . Their parents sleep on the highest floor underneath the eaves in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , a swing hangs in the center from the ceiling . There 's a woodstove to one side with a bathtub beside it ; both the bathtub and the stove stand on lion 's feet . There are bookshelves all along the walls and an atlas , too , which the children pore through , and a set of encyclopedias from which they copy fish . The kitchen , the lowest room , is built into a hill . The floor is made of dirt and gravel , and the stone walls are damp . Blacksnakes come in sometimes to shed their skins . When the children are n't outside , they spend most of their time here ; they play with the stones on the floor , making pyramids or round piles and then knocking them down . There 's a showerhouse outside down a steep , narrow path and a round stone well in the woods behind . <p> There 's nowhere to hide in the house , no cellars or closets , so the children go outside to do that , too . They spend hours standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have battles and tear off each other 's claws . They catch the weak ones later , off-guard and from behind , as they crouch in the dark under shelves of stone . And they catch minnows , to() , and salamanders with the soft skin of frogs , and they try to catch snakes , although they 're never quite sure that they really want to . It maddens them how the water changes things before their eyes , turning the minnows into darting chips of green light and making the dirty stones on the bottom shine . Once they found a snapping turtle frozen in the ice , and their father cut it out with an axe to make soup . The children dunk their heads under and breathe out bubbles . They keep their heads down as long as they can . They like how their hair looks underneath the water , the way it spreads out around their faces in wavering fans . And their voices sound different , too , like the voices of strange people from a foreign place . They put their heads down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing out these strange voices that bloom from their mouths and then swell outwards , endlessly , like no other sound they have ever heard . <p> The children get stung by nettles , ants , poison ivy , poison oak , and bees . They go out into the swamp and come back , their whole heads crawling with ticks and burrs . They pick each other 's scalps outside the house , then lay the ticks on a ledge and grind their bodies to dust with a pointed stone . <p> They watch the pigs get butchered and the chickens killed . They learn that people have teeth inside their heads . One evening , their father takes his shirt off and lies out on the kitchen table to show them where their organs are . He moves his hand over the freckled skin , cupping different places  --  heart , stomach , lung , lung , kidneys , gall bladder , liver here . And suddenly they want to know what 's inside everything , so they tear apart everything they find , flowers , pods , bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard in search of something ; and they want to know about everything they see or ca n't see , frost and earthworms , and who will decide when it rains , and are there ghosts and are there fairies , and how many drops and how many stars , and although they kill things themselves , they want to know why anything dies and where the dead go and where they were waiting before they were born . In the hazelnut grove ? Behind the goathouse ? And how did they know when it was time to come ? <p> Their parents are delighted by the snowlady they build with huge breasts and a penis and rock-necklace hair . Their parents are delighted by these children in every way , these children who will be like no children ever were . In this house with their children , they 'll create a new world  --  that has no relation to the world they have known  --  in which nothing is lied about , whispered about , and nothing is ever concealed . There will be no petty lessons for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaken or what is best to he said and what should n't be spoken of or seen . Nor will these children 's minds he restricted to sets and subsets of rules , rules for children , about when to be quiet or go to bed , the causes and effects of various punishments which increase in gravity on a gradated scale . No , not these children ! These children will be different . They 'll learn only the large things . Here in this house , the world will be revealed in a fresh , new light , and this light will fall over everything . Even those shady forbidden zones through which they themselves wandered as children , panicked and alone , these , too , will be illuminated  --  their children will walk through with torches held high ! Yes , everything should be spoken of in this house , everything , and everything seen . <p> Their father holds them on his lap when he 's going to the bathroom , he lights his farts with matches on the stairs , he likes to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smell , and the children 's shits , too , he has theories about shit that unwind for hours  --  he has theories about everything . He has a study in the toolshed near the house where he sits for hours and is visited regularly by ideas , which he comes in to explain to their mother and the children . When their mother 's busy or not listening , he explains them to the children or to only one child in a language that they do n't understand , but certain words or combinations of words bore themselves into their brains , where they will remain , but the children do n't know this yet , ringing in their ears for the rest of their lives  --  repression , Nixon , wind power , nuclear power , Vietnam , fecal patterns , sea thermal energy , civil rights . And one day these words will bear all sorts of meaning , but now they mean nothing to the children  --  they live the lives of ghosts , outlines with no form , wandering inside their minds . The children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Their parents grow pot in the garden , which they keep under the kitchen sink in a large tin . When the baby-sitter comes , their mother shows her where it is . The baby-sitter plays with the children , a game where you turn the music up very loud , Waylon Jennings , " The Outlaws , " and run around the living room leaping from the couch to the chairs to the swing , trying never to touch the floor . She shows them the tattoo between her legs , a bright rose with thorns , and then she calls up all her friends . When the children come down later to get juice in the kitchen , they see ten naked bodies through a cloud of smoke sitting around the table , playing cards . The children are invited , but they 'd rather not play ; Their parents take them to protests in different cities and to concerts sometimes . The children wear T-shirts and hold posters and then the whole crowd lets off balloons . Their parents have peach parties and invite all their friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creek . Everyone takes off their clothes and rubs peach flesh all over each other 's skin . The children are free to join in , but they do n't feel like it . They sit in a row on the hill in all their clothes . But they memorize the sizes of the breasts and the shapes of the penises of all their parents ' friends and discuss this later amongst themselves . <p> One day , at the end of winter , a woman begins to come to their house . She has gray eyes and a huge mound of wheat-colored hair . She laughs quickly , showing small white teeth . From certain angles , she looks ugly , but from others she seems very nice . She comes in the mornings and picks things in the garden . She 's there again at dinner , at birthdays . She brings presents . She arrives dressed as a rabbit for Easter in a bright yellow pajama suit . She 's very kind to their mother and chatters to her for hours in the kitchen as they cook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends the night at her house . Sometimes he takes the children with him to see her . She lives in a gray house by the river that 's much larger than the children 's house . She has six Siamese cats . She has a piano and many records and piles of soft clay for the children to play with , but they do n't want to . They go outside and stand by the concrete frog pond near the road . Algae covers it like a hairy , green blanket . They stare down , trying to spot frogs . They chuck rocks in , candy , pennies , or whatever else they can find . <p> In the gray spring mornings , there 's a man either coming or going from their mother 's room . He leaves the door open . Did you hear them ? I heard them . Did you see them ? Yes . But they do n't talk about it . They no longer talk about things amongst themselves . But they answer their father 's questions when he asks . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away for good and then comes back to visit or takes them out on trips in his car and tells them about the women he 's been with , how they make love , what he prefers or does n't like , gestures or movements of the arms , neck , or legs described in the most detailed terms-And what do they think ? And what would they suggest ? When a woman stands with a cigarette between her breasts at the end of the bed and you suddenly lose all hope  --  And he talks about their mother , too , the way she makes love . He 'd much rather talk to them than to anyone else . These children , they 're amazing ! They rise to all occasions , stoop carefully to any sorrow  --  and their minds ! Their minds are wide open and flow with no stops , like damless streams . And the children nod also when one of their mother 's boyfriends comes by to see her  --  she 's not there-they 're often heartbroken , occasionally drunk , they want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . They ca n't see for the sun in their eyes , but they look up , anyway , and nod , smile politely , nod . <p> The children play with their mother 's boyfriends out in the snow . They go to school . They 're sure they 'll never learn to read . They stare at the letters . They lose all hope . They worry that they do n't know the Lord 's Prayer . They realize that they do n't know God or anything about him , so they ask the other children shy questions in the schoolyard and receive answers that baffle them , and then God fills their minds like a guest who 's moved in , but keeps his distance , and worries them to distraction at night when they 're alone . They imagine they hear his movements through the house , his footsteps and the rustling of his clothes . They grow frightened for their parents , who seem to have learned nothing about God 's laws . They feel that they should warn them , but they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother is a robber . They hear her creeping through the house alone , lifting and rattling things . <p> At school , they learn to read and spell . They learn penmanship and multiplication . They 're surprised at first by all the rules , but then they learn them too quickly and observe them all carefully . They learn not to swear . They get prizes for obedience , for following the rules down to the last detail . They 're delighted by these rules , these arbitrary lines that regulate behavior and mark off forbidden things , and they examine them closely and exhaust their teachers with questions about the mechanical functioning and the hidden intricacies of these beings , the rules : I f at naptime , you 're very quiet with your eyes shut tight and your arms and legs so still you barely breathe , but really you 're not sleeping , underneath your arms and beneath your eyelids you 're wide awake and thinking very hard about how to be still , but you get the prize anyway for sleeping because you were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , you should n't get the prize or should you , because the prize is really for sleeping and not being still , or is it also for being still ... ? <p> When the other children in the schoolyard are whispering themselves into wild confusion about their bodies and sex and babies being born , these children stay quiet and stand to one side . They 're mortified by what they know and have seen . They 're sure that if they mention one word , the other children will go home and tell their parents who will tell their teachers who will be horrified and disgusted and push them away . But they also think they should be punished . They should be shaken , beaten , for what they 've seen . These children do n't touch themselves . They grow hesitant with worry . At home , they wander out into the yard alone and stand there at a terrible loss . One day , when the teacher calls on them , they 're no longer able to speak . But then they speak again a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have periods in their lives when their voices disappear utterly or else become very thin and quavering like ghosts or old people lost in their throats . <p> But the children love to read . They suddenly discover the use of all these books in the house and turn the living room into a lend ing library . Each book has a card and a due date and is stamped when it 's borrowed or returned . They play card games and backgammon . They go over to friends ' houses and learn about junk food and how to watch TV . But mostly they read . They read about anything , love stories , the lives of inventors and famous Indians , blights that affect hybrid plants . They try to read books they ca n't read at all and skip words and whole paragraphs and sit like this for hours lost in a stunning blur . <p> They take violin lessons at school and piano lessons and then stop one day when their hands begin to shake so badly they can no longer hold to the keys . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costumes and put on plays . They 're kings and queens . They 're witches . They put on a whole production of The Wizard of Oz . They play detectives with identity cards and go searching for the kittens who have just been born in some dark , hidden place on their land . They store away money to give to their father when he comes . They spend whole afternoons at the edge of the yard waiting for him to come . They do n't understand why their father behaves so strangely now , why he sleeps in their mother 's bed when she 's gone in the afternoon and then gets up and slinks around the house , like a criminal , chuckling , especially when she 's angry and has told him to leave . They do n't know why their father seems laughed at now and unloved , why he needs money from them to drive home in his car , why he seems to need something from them that they can not give him  --  everything-but they 'll try to give him  --  everything  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this as hard as they can . <p> Their father comes and waits for their mother in the house . He comes and takes them away on trips in his car . They go to quarries , where they line up and leap off cliffs . They go looking for caves up in the hills in Virginia . There are bears here , he tells them , but if you ever come face to face with one , just swear your heart out and he 'll run . He takes them to dances in the city where only old people go . Do n't they know how to fox-trot ? Do n't they know how to waltz ? They sit at tables and order sodas , waiting for their turn to be picked up and whirled around by him . Or they watch him going around to other tables , greeting husbands and inviting their wives , women much older than his mother , to dance . These woman have blue or white hair . They either get up laughing or refuse . He comes back to the children to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , or water , or molasses . He takes them to see the pro-wrestling championship match . He takes them up north for a week to meditate inside a hotel with a guru from Bombay . He takes them running down the up-escalators in stores and up Totem Mountain at night in a storm . He talks his head off . He gets speeding tickets left and right . He holds them on his lap when he 's driving and between his legs when they ski . When be begins to fall asleep at the wheel , they rack their brains , trying to think of ways to keep him awake . They rub his shoulders and pull his hair . They sing rounds . They ask him questions to try to make him talk . They do interviews in the back seat , saying things they know will amuse him . And when their efforts are exhausted , he tells them that the only way he 'll ever stay awake is if they insult him in the cruelest way they can . He says their mother is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells them that they have to say mean things about her , about her boyfriends and lovers and what they do , or about how much she hates him , thinks he 's stupid , an asshole , a failure , how much she does n't want him around . And so they do . They force themselves to invent insults or say things that are terrible but true . And as they speak , they feel their mouths turn chalky and their stomachs begin to harden as if with each word they had swallowed a stone . But he seems delighted . He laughs and encourages them , turning around in his seat to look at their faces , his eyes now completely off the road . <p> He wants them to meet everyone he knows . They show up on people 's doorsteps with him in the middle of the day or late at night . He can hardly contain himself . These are my kids ! he says . They 're smarter than anyone I know , and ten times smarter than me ! Do you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smarter than you ? ! He teaches them how to play bridge and to ski backwards . At dinner with him , you have to eat with your eyes closed . When you go through a stoplight , you have to hold on to your balls . But the girls ? Oh yes , the girls  --  well , just improvise ! He 's experiencing flatulence , withdrawal from wheat . He 's on a new diet that will ruthlessly clean out his bowels . There are turkeys and assholes everywhere in the world . Do they know this ? Do they know ? But he himself is probably the biggest asshole here . Still , women find him handsome  --  they do ! They actually do ! And funny . But he is funny , he actually is , not witty but funny , they do n't realize this because they see him all the time , they 're used to it , but other people  --  like that waitress ! Did they see that waitress ? She was laughing so hard she could barely see straight ! Do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts . But he himself is not a breast man . Think of Morn  --  he calls their mother Mom  --  she has no breasts at all ! But her taste in men is mindboggling . Do n't they think ? Mind-boggling ! Think about it too long , and you 'll lose your mind . Why do they think she picks these guys ? What is it ? And why are women almost always so much smarter than men ? And more dignified ? Dignity for men is a completely lost cause ! And why does anyone have kids , anyway ? Come on , why ? ! Because they like you ? Because they laugh at you ? No ! Because they 're fun ! Exactly ! They 're fun ! <p> Around the house there are briar patches with berries and thorns . There are gnarled apple trees with puckered gray skins . The windows are all open  --  the wasps are flying in . The clothes on the line are jumping like children with no heads but hysterical limbs . Who will drown the fresh new kitties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in winter and haul that firewood in ? Who will do away with all these animals , or tend them , or sell them , kill them one by one ? Who will say to her in the evening that it all means nothing , that tomorrow will be different , that the heart gets tired after all ? And where are the children ? When will they come home ? She has burnt all her diaries . She has told the man in the barn to go away . Who will remind her again that the heart has its own misunderstandings ? And the heart often loses its way and can be found hours later wandering down passageways with unexplained bruises on its skin . On the roof , there was a child standing one day years ago , his arms waving free , but one foot turned inward , weakly  --  When will it be evening ? When will it be night ? The tree frogs are beginning to sing . She has seen the way their toes clutch at the bark . Some of them are spotted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throats . There may be a storm . It may rain . That cloud there looks dark  --  but no , it 's a wisp of burnt paper , too thin . In the woods above , there 's a house that burnt down to the ground , but then a grove of lilac bushes burst up from the char . A wind is coming up . There are dark purple clouds now . There are red-coned sumacs hovering along the edge of the drive . Poisonous raw , but fine for tea . The leaves on the apple trees are all turning blue . The sunflowers in the garden are quivering , heads bowed  --  empty of seed now . And the heart gets watered and recovers itself . There is hope , everywhere there 's hope . Light approaches from the back . Between the dry , gnarled branches , it 's impossible to see . There are the first few drops . There are the oak trees shuddering . There 's a flicker of bright gray , the underside of one leaf . There was once a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss . Did she know this ? Yes . The children ! ( They have her arms , his ears , his voice , his smell , her soft features , her movements of the hand and head , her stiffness , his confusion , his humor , her ambition , his daring , his eyelids , their failure , their hope , their freckled skin  --  ) <p> <p> By MAXINE SWANN <p>
