In the heart of Dublin , rare plants flourish in a formal setting <p> GARDENING IN IRELAND , where the climate is influenced favorably by the proximity of the ocean , offers boundless possibilities . Because Dublin lies only a few miles inland from the Irish Sea , winters are mild , summers are cool , and rain is frequent . Without winter or summer extremes , perennials and tender woody plants grow so vigorously that they produce subtropical foliage effects . For the last 15 years , Helen Dillon ? has taken advantage of this enviable climate in creating her garden at 45 Sandford Road . <p> Sandford Road is a busy Dublin thoroughfare , but its early-19th-century detached villas are set back from the street and surrounded by trees , creating an almost country-style landscape . At the turn of the century the house next door to the Dillons ' , with its old yews and walnuts , a specimen Itea ilicifolia , and a fine Populus vernirubens , was owned by the great Irish plant explorer Augustine Henry . In the Dillons ' garden Lilium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dillon 's achievement is remarkable . I know of no other small garden ( it is an enclosed town oasis of less than one acre ) that so successfully combines style with a flourishing and well-displayed collection of interesting plants . The garden is a fine example of how " good bones " will hold a design together and provide a framework inside which plants can be given priority without detracting from the overall sense of order and harmony . Thus it both pleases the design purist and , with its expertly grown rarities , excites the envy of the plantsman . The fact that the whole garden is meticulously well kept enhances its rare beauty . The lawn is mowed in broad traditional sweeps ; bare earth looks rich and fertile ; dead flower heads and withering foliage are removed by hand ; and leaves are never allowed to accumulate in corners . Everywhere the details of stonework , planted urns , and pots are of a consistently high quality . <p> Dillon has succeeded with her plant treasures by enriching and , where necessary , changing the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding moisture-conserving humus to lower the pH ; in other places  --  where her alpines are planted , for example  --  she has had to provide more alkaline soil with good drainage . As a result , plants grow well for Dillon  --  sometimes too well  --  but by constant vigilance she has remained in control . <p> When glimpsed from the drawing-room windows above , the main garden to the south of the house reveals a tight classical formula . A central lawn is the axial pivot from which radiate small garden areas contained by the perimeter walls . The overall emphasis is on symmetry and balance , yet as one moves through the garden this structured concept gives way to the intimacy of hidden garden areas  --  a series of informally shaped rooms  --  where color and plant themes dominate and the grand design is temporarily forgotten and blurred . Ornamental trees , large shrubs , espaliered fruit trees , and arbors and archways curtained with roses and clematis not only contribute to the three-dimensional variety in the garden , they also create patterns of light and shadow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted borders line the central lawn to conceal curving perimeter beds , secret paved areas bordered with raised beds for alpines , and luxuriantly planted tubs and urns . Two prominently placed trees enhance the effect . An architectural specimen of the Asian dogwood Cornus controversa Variegata ' , with spreading branches and cream-edged leaves , marks a corner on the west side of the lawn ; it is balanced by a honey locust ( Gleditsia triacanthos Sunburst ' ) that flanks the eastern wall . <p> Behind the house the lower terrace provides a hot site for scrambling plants such as Euphorbia myrsinites and diascias , which soften the edges of the stonework . Ceanothus Trewithen Blue ' curtains the wall above myrtles ; coronilla ; Calceolaria integrifolia , which survives the winters ; Hebe hulkeana ; Pelargonium The Boar ' , an old Edwardian favorite with muted salmon-colored petals ; and trailing globe mallows ( Sphaeralcea species ) with both orange and pink flowers . Stone sphinxes and bay trees in pots flank the broad steps beside urns packed with daisy-flowered argyranthemums . <p> From here , leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the garden into a secret world of plants . Daphne bholua and sarcococcas produce their scented flowers in January ; gray-leaved Buddleia crispa and Acacia pravissima , clinging to the walls , bloom in early spring above a group of imperial lilies ( Lilium Ximperiale ) with unusual variegated foliage . A white-flowered solanum and a late-flowering Clematis viticella twine on a metal trellis ; the pink rose Belvedere Rambler ' scrambles over an old pear tree . A rampant California tree poppy ( Romneya coulteri ) thrusts its way through paving and neighboring plants to bloom for many weeks in summer . Across the bottom of the garden a raised bed provides a site for the difficult , blue-flowered Chatham Island forget-me-not ( Myosotidium hortensia ) , which likes to be dry in winter . <p> In the eastern borders a strong hot color scheme is deliberately startling . Crimson and cherry-red lobelias , Dahlia Bishop of Llandaff ' , scarlet penstemons , Verbena Lawrence Johnston ' , Primula Inverewe ' , and the bronze-leaved Heuchera Palace Purple ' are planted in drifts between purple-foliaged forms of Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year Dillon added the red rose Fensham ' , and the overall effect will be softened with groups of cream-flowered Artemisia lactiflora . <p> THE INFORMALLY laid out front garden faces north . Here the walls of the house and the balustraded steps provide planting sites for shade-loving climbers such as Hydrangea anomala subspecies petiolaris and the tender evergreen coral plant ( Berberidopsis corallina ) from Chile . A curving pathway leading to the front door divides the area roughly in two , and smaller pathways around the edges of wide borders allow for close inspection of the unusual plants contained in them . The surfaces of the beds , which have been contoured with fresh , acidic topsoil , are deliberately shaped into peaks and valleys that help to conceal parts of the planting . Among the plants here are gray-leaved barberries ( Berberis dictyophylla and B. temolaica ) , Rosa chinensis Mutabilis ' , grassy-leaved astelias , and the bayonet-leaved Aciphylla aurea . There is also an impressive collection of ornamental grasses , including Stipa gigantea , with bronze oatlike flower heads ; the golden Hakonechloa macra Aureola ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants , especially the smaller ones , are collector 's items that she has obtained through the great " exchange and share " system that operates between all true gardeners ; her enthusiasm for these plants , however , is matched by her readiness to give to others . Her plants reflect both her eye for detail and an awareness of what makes a plant first-rate rather than mediocre . Her firm grasp of design elements ensures that the plants have a worthy setting . <p> Above all , Helen Dillon 's garden is magical and beautiful . Although many of the choice plants sport long Latin names , one need not identify them to enjoy them . To garden well is to strike a balance between harmonious design and the collector 's instinct for the unusual . By reconciling these dual elements , Helen Dillon has perfected garden art . Interesting plants abound , but the philosopher is not forgotten .
