At the end of Charles Busch 's campy 1985 hit Vampire Lesbians of Sodom , the two ageless , eponymous hags decide to take their act on the road . Tahoe , Chicago , Boston and then the glittering climax  --  Broadway ! Well , dears , that 's one faded dream . The Great White Way still welcomes the big musicals , those theme parks with song cues , and a few dramas ( usually developed elsewhere , often with subsidies ) . But it is now only one stop  --  perhaps the biggest , and at $75 a top ticket surely the priciest  --  on the world tour of hits . For original work , for vitality and glamour , more than ever , off- Broadway is the place to be . <P> The smaller theaters in New York City have long been home to droll souls like Busch , as well as to camp cabaret like the French import Les Incroyables ( 70 endless minutes of cross-dressing , lip-synching and canned cancan ) and innocent party-time musicals like Nunsense 2 : The Sequel ( this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play " Pin the Braid on Sinead " ) . <P> Now off-Broadway is also attracting top stars and prestige playwrights . This month Vanessa Redgrave opens in Vita and Virginia and the Joseph Papp Public Theater premieres Sam Shepard 's Simpatico . In December the Public has a new Hal Prince musical , The Petrified Prince . January brings a trio of one-acters by Woody Allen , David Mamet and Elaine May . Neil Simon , a Broadway pillar for a third of a century , made news recently when he said that mainstem plays had become too expensive to produce . Now even he is off-Broadway bound . <P> But why wait for these luminaries ? Right now Manhattan playgoers will find this year 's Pulitzer drama winner ( Edward Albee 's Three Tall Women ) and a likely candidate for next year 's prize ( Terrence McNally 's Love ! Valour ! Compassion ! ) . Walk down 42nd Street to find the wittiest evening in town ( David Ives ' All in the Timing ) . And if you wonder what Kenneth Branagh does when he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his 1987 play Public Enemy . <P> Household names on the marquee do not , of course , guarantee dramatic splendor inside . The Branagh play is a trifle that searches for nightmare poetry in " plain old American-Irish English " and for political significance in the story of a Belfast punk ( Paul Ronan ) obsessed by the grit and grace of Jimmy Cagney . It finds none of the above , lost as it is in a muddle of moralizing and attitudinizing . But it shares a potent theme with the season 's cannier off-Broadway ventures : that star worship is a virus , carried by the popular media and infecting anyone who has a little talent and big gaudy dreams . The difference is that , in many other shows , the Warner Bros. star whom the hero might dream of being is not Cagney but Bette Davis , patron saint of bitchery , proto-queen of camp . <P> Off-Broadway has long been the Gay White Way . When Broadway , in the postwar era of Tennessee Williams , William Inge and Edward Albee , addressed homosexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The modern gay writer can address his dreams and demons directly ; and in the aids plague , he has a suitable subject for domestic tragedy . Today the gay sensibility  --  acerb , lusty , nostalgic , poignant  --  dominates high drama and low comedy .
