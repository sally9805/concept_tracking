<p> ANYONE WHO HATES Sir Peter Hall should invite him to spend two weeks beside some idyllic swimming pool , doing nothing but sunbathe and sip champagne . Such a regimen , he says with a shudder , would make him miserable . <p> Conversely , anyone who wishes the 65-year-old director well should insure that he follows a program that would shatter a man half his age . What about bringing a Feydeau farce to the West End , staging Beethoven 's " Fidelio " in Rome , organizing a major radio revival of Shaw 's " Man and Superman , " putting the finishing touches on a two-part television drama about West Indians in Britain , and transferring his production of Oscar Wilde 's " Ideal Husband " to New York  --  and all in the space of a few weeks ? <p> That has been the first third of 1996 as Sir Peter wanted it , planned it and has come very near to achieving . His production of " Fidelio , " scheduled to open on April 16 , was suddenly aborted after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . But that setback only meant that Sir Peter scheduled extra rehearsals of Feydeau 's " Mind Millie for Me , " which was on an out-of-town tour before starting previews at the Haymarket Theater four days ago . There , it replaced " An Ideal Husband , " which opens on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Wednesday . <p> A doctor once told Sir Peter that his body manufactured so much adrenalin that he had become addicted to it . But that 's only half the reason he loathes the idea of taking life easy : " I do n't work because someone or something is making me , or because of economic compulsion , but because I love it . I need to rehearse every day . No one says to a painter , why do n't you stop painting ? There might come a time when I want to slow down , but it has n't happened in the 43 years I 've been directing . " <p> Some people assumed Sir Peter would lessen his workload when he gave up the most taxing job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theater , back in 1988 . Instead , he formed the Peter Hall Company , a commercial organization that started life in high style by dispatching Vanessa Redgrave in Tennessee Williams 's " Orpheus Descending " and Dustin Hoffman in Shakespeare 's " Merchant of Venice " from London to New York . <p> Though " An Ideal Husband " is the first of his productions since then to have made the crossing , plenty of others have kept his name before the British public . At one point , in 1993 , five plays directed by him  --  four for the Peter Hall Company , one for the Royal Shakespeare Company  --  were running simultaneously in London . <p> Is there a danger , then , of substituting quantity for quality ? " That 's for other people to answer , " he said . " I do think , though , that people accuse me of spreading myself too thin because they get furious at my appetite and energy . It 's somehow un-British , is n't it , to try too hard . I do n't say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Picasso , You 're painting too much and you 're 80 , so why do n't you stop ? And if an actor keeps on acting , nobody accuses him of spreading himself too thin . " <p> Certainly , Sir Peter has the respect of his senior fellow professionals . Richard Eyre , who succeeded him as director of the National Theater , left " An Ideal Husband " thinking it a better play than Wilde 's more famous " Importance of Being Earnest . " " He made me feel I 'd underestimated it , " Mr. Eyre said . " And that 's typical of his work , which is true to the text , unostentatious , uncluttered , lucid , quite muscular and wonderfully accessible . " <p> Adrian Noble , director of the Royal Shakespeare Company , thought " An Ideal Husband " demonstrated Sir Peter 's skill at choosing the right cast and giving it creative freedom . " He takes on more work than anyone should , " Mr. Noble said , " yet gets such good performances out of his actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent and handing on the baton to new directors . " <p> And certainly Sir Peter 's recent productions have been well received by the public . A revival of " Hamlet , " with the little-known Stephen Dillane as a quirky , unglamorous prince , defied conventional wisdom by succeeding on commercial Shaftesbury Avenue , and " An Ideal Husband " has been playing to an average of 90 percent capacity on what is actually its return visit to the West End . <p> SIR PETER 'S PRODUCtion , first seen in 1992 , was restaged in London only because a special deal was negotiated with the actors ' unions allowing a Broadway transfer . British Equity agreed to let Sir Peter bring Jessica Lange and a mainly American cast to the West End in Tennessee Williams 's " Streetcar Named Desire " next fall , so American Equity allowed Martin Shaw , Penny Downie and most of the other Britons in Wilde 's play to go to New York . <p> If Sir Peter has not lost his appetite for work since leaving the National , he has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizably the man who leaped on a coffee table at a press conference in 1985 to denounce the Government 's financial cuts to the theater , famously provoking the Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher , to ask her arts minister , " When can we stop giving money to awful people like Peter Hall ? " Few directors would dare denounce the restrictive practices of both branches of Equity so ferociously . <p> When Sir Peter formed his new company in 1988 , he hoped that almost all of its productions would play on both sides of the Atlantic . And almost every one , he said , has attracted interest from America . But the reason so few have transferred is not only the hesitancy of Broadway producers to restage financially risky work like Aristophanes ' " Lysistrata " or the Dillane " Hamlet . " It is also because neither Equity permits foreigners to perform in its own country unless they adhere to strict conditions . Usually that means they must be international stars , or arrive with a permanent ensemble , which the Comedie-Francaise is but the Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a swap : " Ideal Husband " for " Streetcar . " <p> Three years ago , Sir Peter refused to take Peter Shaffer 's play " Gift of the Gorgon " to New York because American Equity rejected its leading man , Michael Pennington . Last year , London and Toronto saw his revival of Ibsen 's " Master Builder " but Broadway missed out . The union accepted Alan Bates as Solness , but not Victoria Hamilton as Hilde , even though she received some of the most stunning reviews that can ever have come a newcomer 's way . More recently , British Equity refused to allow Sir Peter to introduce London theatergoers to a young Trinidadian actor he calls " a bit of a genius , " Michael Cherry , who stars in " The Final Passage , " his two-part film about the influx of West Indians into Britain . <p> " Both Equities need their heads banging together , because both of them are ignorant protection societies , " rages Sir Peter . " I think they 're a disgrace to the profession on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be about the nurturing of talent , especially young talent . It should be about an interchange that 's productive and creative . But a closed shop is defensive and deadening , and I 've never met an actor in either country who does n't bemoan it . It is simply dreadful , and it makes me terribly angry . " <p> Alan Eisenberg , executive secretary of Actors ' Equity in New York , responded to Sir Peter 's criticisms last week , describing them as " petulant and ill thought out . " The director , he said " is living in a dream world " if he believes that American performers would oppose policies preventing an influx of British actors . Such regulations , he said , help to insure that American actors are not denied the opportunity to develop their talents . Though he noted that unemployment among his union 's membership is sometimes as high as 90 percent , he said that Equity has become more liberal . Since 1981 , it has agreed to a total of 94 exchanges of individual actors between America and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Husband " will , in any case , give New Yorkers the chance to see why the British critics were so enthusiastic about a play often dismissed as a Victorian melodrama peppered with Wildean jokes . The reason Sir Peter wanted to direct it and even tried several times to mount a production when he was running the National , was that he believed it a deeper , more humane piece than is usually supposed . " Though it 's 100 years old , it could n't be more violently contemporary , both politically and sexually , " he said . <p> IN SIR PETER 'S VIEW , THE story of Sir Robert Chiltern , the statesman blackmailed for a financial indiscretion he committed years ago , has obvious resonances for both Britain and America . But the most prominent character in his production is Lord Goring , the Wildean wit and dandy who gives kindly but shrewd advice to both the politician and the politician 's judgmental wife . As played by Martin Shaw , Goring is , said Sir Peter , " an extremely tolerant man who really understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unacknowledged bisexual , likely to prove " a jolly good husband to his wife and a very good father to his children , " Sir Peter said . <p> In other words , he has much in common with Wilde himself . " Yes , " the director continued : " The play is obviously autobiographical . It was written when Wilde was being blackmailed by rentboys , and six months after it opened he was in Reading Gaol . It 's a play about bisexuality written at a time when you could n't admit in the theater that homosexuality existed . Even in the 1960 's , the feeling was you had to be one thing or the other . Now we are beginning to admit that bisexuality may actually be the norm . " <p> Fop Sir Peter , the jokes are not decorative but a " comic version of the British stiff upper lip , an attempt to keep control at times of great tension and difficulty . " Indeed , it 's the play 's combination of humor and emotional seriousness to which he attributes its success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York every day : " The political scandal makes audiences laugh , but there is also an enormous tenderness and tolerance in the play that I think we yearn for now . We live in a society that is so competitive and selfish that audiences really respond to ideas of understanding and forgiveness . " <p> What next ? There were newspaper reports two months ago that Sir Peter had suffered a serious heart attack . In fact , he fainted after giving a two-hour lecture to the company he formed 36 years ago , the Royal Shakespeare Company , and then driving through heavy traffic to a theater 10 miles south of London . Tests in the cardiac ward of a local hospital revealed he was suffering from tension . The Grim Reaper  --  a figure Sir Peter has admitted he fearfully ponders every day  --  was not about to pounce . " I feel very well , very energetic , " he said . " And my appetite for life is as strong as ever . " <p> Extracurricular life th'se days revolves round Nicki , his fourth wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . In the autobiography he published in 1993 , Sir Peter spoke of bouts of near-suicidal depression that had hit him when he was working too hard or , sometimes , not working hard enough . But the marriage he made in 1990 is , he declares , keeping them at bay . <p> That does n't mean any let-up in a regimen that will , he vows , continue until he does indeed drop dead . After completing " Man and Superman " for BBC radio and transferring the " Julius Caesar " he directed last year from Stratford to London , he stages Sophocles ' " Oedipus " plays at the National and in Greece , directs Moliere 's " School for Wives " and Williams 's " Streetcar " for his own company , and starts readying himself to do a six-hour television film based on Barrie Unsworth 's slave-trade novel , " The Sacred Hunger . " <p> He would also like to form an ensemble of about 12 actors , take over a West End theater and offer programs of three plays in repertory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , with Sir Peter , hopes have a way of happening .
