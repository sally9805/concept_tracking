THE INITIAL WHITE HOUSE REACtion to the Los Angeles riots was to blame them on the " failed " Democratic poverty programs of the ' 60s and ' 70s . That claim by Marlin Fitzwater was pilloried so mercilessly that President Bush had to backpedal away from his own spokesman . But Fitzwater 's comments did not come out of a vacuum . Bush has made public assistance  --  specifically welfare  --  a constant target of his campaign rhetoric . He compared the dole to a " narcotic " in his State of the Union message and regularly peppers his speeches with vows to " change welfare and make the able-bodied work . " <P> This line is not surprising coming from a political heir of Ronald Reagan , who voiced his contempt for public assistance with apocryphal stories of " welfare queens " driving Cadillacs . What is surprising is how many Democrats and liberals are sounding the same themes . Presumptive nominee Bill Clinton insists that " those on welfare move into the workplace " within two years . New Jersey Governor Jim Florio denounces the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state governments , meanwhile , are slashing benefits and throwing thousands off the rolls . " America has moved from a war on poverty to a war on the poor , " says Yale University professor Theodore Marmor , co-author of America 's Misunderstood Welfare State . <P> What 's going on here ? Has America 's traditional compassion for the downtrodden worn thin ? Is the country that paid billions to liberate a wealthy oil sheikdom on the other side of the globe suddenly unwilling to feed hungry kids at home ? <P> Not exactly . Americans have always been willing to help the genuinely needy . But there is growing resistance to the notion of giving money unconditionally to able-bodied adults  --  and an insistence on mutual obligation as the only fair basis for public aid . " There 's a deep-running stream in American life , " says Marmor , " that comes out a fundamental belief in individual responsibility , in the concept that you earn your own way . " <P> Welfare has never been popular in the U.S. The word itself has become a politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When participants in a TIME/CNN poll conducted by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman were asked if the government was spending too much on the " poor , " only 17% said yes ; asked if too much was being spent on " welfare , " 32% said yes . Yet the same poll showed strong support for positive , rather than punitive , reforms . Ninety-three percent said the main goal of such efforts should be to make people self-sufficient ; only 3% cited cost cutting as the aim . <P> The Los Angeles riots have cast a spotlight on the problems of poverty and urban decay . But long before that explosion , the recession put welfare high on the political agenda by swelling public-assistance rolls with legions of unemployed workers . Around 4.7 million households , or 13.6 million individuals , are receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) , the main cash-assistance program . That 's an increase of 24% in the past two years . The number of food-stamp recipients shot up from 20.9 million in October 1990 to 24.2 million a year later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $40 billion a year .
