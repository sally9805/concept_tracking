<p> No constitutional crisis <p> Regarding Daniel D. New 's Dec. 10 Outlook article , " " Thank God that Spc . Michael New has taken a stand " : <p> As a retired Air Force colonel , I understand and empathize with his defense of his son . But , in addition to love and loyalty , he bases his defense on fallacious facts . <p> Yes , the framers of our Constitution placed control of the military in civilian hands , but not those in the Congress ( thank God ) . <p> From the first administration , control of the military has rested with civilians in the executive branch . Yes , they feared a standing army - and rightly so ; hence civilian control . <p> Having taken the oath and adhering to it for 27 years , I bore " " true faith and allegiance " to the oath , not to God . <p> The words , " " so help me God " refer to my appeal to the almighty to assist me in bearing that " " true faith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew full well , as did my fellow servicemen , that I was only bound to obey lawful orders consistent with the Constitution . <p> New 's son was given a lawful order , like it or not . That has been borne out by legal review and will be borne out by the results of the courts-martial . <p> Michael New was not being asked to serve any power other than the United States ; his unit would have remained under U.S.command . <p> What the United States is doing under the auspices of the United Nations differs little from what we did in Korea and in the Persian Gulf . In case Mr. New has forgotten , those were actions under the auspices of the United Nations . <p> Daniel New is also wrong when he states that , " " the authority to send American troops in any dispute ... is a right expressly reserved to Congress . " <p> The president has authority to deploy forces where and when he sees fit . Congress has the authority to declare war and the fund the armed forces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops on his own . " <p> Despite what New asserts , the deployment his son was ordered to was not " " patently illegal , " and this has been and will be borne out in his son 's court-martial . <p> I am sure that Michael New is acting in good conscience . I respect his decision , although I do not agree with it . <p> Regrettably , he chose to defy a lawful order and will pay for that decision . <p> Regardless of Daniel New 's impassioned statement , we have no " " constitutional crisis . " <p> What we have is a sincere , albeit misguided , young man who has drawn his line in the sand and will suffer the consequences for it . God be with him . <p> William C. Bender , Bryan . <p> Thanks , Rep. Fields <p> It was a sad day for the Houston area to hear that U.S. Rep. <p> Jack Fields , R-Humble , has called it quits . He is a true statesman . <p> Although his party is in power and he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position within the Republican Party , he bowed out without provocation . <p> Thank you , Jack Fields , for your dedication and service . <p> Raymond Taylor , League City . <p> For Sweet Pea 's sake <p> Houstonians now have seen the offensive plastic bag regurgitated by Sweet Pea , " " our " manatee now at Sea World . <p> Let us remember that every plastic bag , Styrofoam cup or cigarette filter that we dump on Houston streets washes down the storm drains , along the bayous , through the Houston Ship Channel and Galveston Bay , into the Gulf of Mexico . <p> There it is often mistaken for food by unfortunate fish , dolphins , whales , turtles and , yes , even manatees . For Sweet Pea 's sake , and for the sake of all Texans , please do n't mess with Texas ' waters . <p> Litter is truly awful and unlawful . <p> Kenneth D. Knezick , chairman Seaspace , Houston . <p> We 've only just begun <p> Carol Cardona wrote how accusations against House Speaker Newt Gingrich signaled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Merry Christmas , Ms. Cardona . We 've only just begun . Have you noticed all the elected officials in Texas that have switched from the Democrat to the Republican Party ? Have any Republicans switched to the Democratic Party ? <p> Do n't hold your breath . While Newt has been an excellent leader , these few small charges against him wo n't slow grass-root conservatives . <p> J. Griffin , Seabrook . <p> Save Allen Parkway <p> In her Dec. 3 Outlook article , Marta McBride Galicki has given us a comprehensive look at the issues surrounding the preservation of Allen Parkway Village , and an exciting perspective and vision for all urban preservation . <p> APV was a pioneering project in its own time . Now , after decades of failed social housing policy , we can clearly appreciate the intelligent and far-reaching vision that created this modest , low-rise , low-density garden community . <p> The plan that has been put forward for the rehabilitation and use of APV represents an innovative national model for urban , architectural and historic preservation combined with thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current condition of APV is not a failure of conception or design . It is a failure of bureaucratic , administrative and maintenance policies . <p> Corporate welfare should not be allowed to take precedent over the economical and appropriate management of this valuable civic asset . <p> Please , Houston , be a leader . Save Allen Parkway Village . <p> Diane Wray , director , Modern Architecture Preservation League , Denver , Co . <p> ' The president of peace ' <p> For his role in the peace process in the Middle East , Northern Ireland and Bosnia , President Clinton is emerging as the " " president of peace . " It is an honor for all of us and for the United States . <p> We need to support him in his efforts . <p> Mohammed Daud , Houston . <p> Cart before the horse <p> Reading Joyce Gehring Zachman 's Dec. 8 Outlook article on legal challenges to adoptive families , one might assume that permanence and finality of parental legal authority are characteristics of biological parenthood . <p> Nothing could be further from the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only by parental abuse , neglect and abandonment , but also by a high divorce rate , family laws which encourage never-ending adversarial activity by divorced parents , social trends including single parenthood and loss of the extended family , modern trends in pediatrics and child psychiatry which isolate ( " " empower " ) the child from parental authority and witch-hunt mentalities of social agencies which continuously redefine abuse . <p> In short , the permanence that Zachman seeks is simply not a component of modern life ; biological parents hardly retain the authority to raise their own children . <p> Providing legal protections to adoptive parents before they are available to biological parents is putting the cart before the horse . <p> The making of requests by adoption advocates for special consideration risks the creation of mutually destructive biological/adoptive rivalry . <p> William Grimes , Bellaire . <p> Another investigation ? <p> Regarding U.S. Rep.
