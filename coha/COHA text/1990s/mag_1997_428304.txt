The confused man 's guide to getting dressed without getting burned <p> ONE DAY LAST SUMMER , while a few of us were playing **29;607;TOOLONG , a smartly dressed managerial sort stepped in to put an end to our fun . It was n't our recreational practices he had a beef with ; it was the way we were dressed . Seems he was upset by our combination of sweatpants and cashmere sweaters . So we kicked him  --  but not before realizing that the guy had a point . We 've seemingly bought all the right clothes , but sometimes we have a hard time matching them up . It 's probably the same for you  --  all those stripes , all those patterns , all those shoes  --  why , a man could go plumb loco trying to keep them all straight . That 's why we came up with 10 simple rules for making sure your clothes look like they belong together on you and not separate on three other people . These rules are n't going to put you on the cutting edge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the circus . RULE #1 When in doubt , defer to simple . <p> In this case , simple means solid . " People spend so much time worrying about how to put together patterns that it 's amazing they overlook the simple solutions , " says Alan Flusser , a New York men 's fashion designer and author of Style and the Man . " Consider this , " says Flusser . " What is the one thing that every man looks good in , no matter what he looks like ? A tuxedo . And it 's only two solid colors , black and white . " The point is that as long as your clothes are properly fitted and your tie is properly proportioned and knotted , you can be stylish wearing solid colors with one pattern mixed in . " If you 're going with a gray suit and blue shirt , wear a tie that picks up the blue and the gray , " says Flusser . " Simplistic ? Yes , but you wo n't get in trouble . " RULE #2 Large tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripes , the tighter the tie pattern . <p> The mixing of stripes and other patterns is not such a daunting endeavor that you should n't consider it , says Warren Christopher , Men 's Health clothing and grooming editor . Just remember to keep it simple . For example , when you 're matching a suit , shirt and tie , stick to two patterns ( one stripe , one non-stripe ) maximum . While it 's true that the more sophisticated your sense of style , the more you can get away with , you got ta walk before you run , man . So ... <p> If you want to wear a striped suit , wear a solid shirt . <p> If you want to wear a striped shirt , wear a solid suit . <p> Okay , now you need to pick out a tie . Here 's where most guys screw up . <p> If the stripes on your suit or shirt are close together , go for a large pattern in the tie . A tightly patterned tie would fight for attention with the stripes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some breathing room between them , go for a tie with a small , tight pattern . RULE #3 Checked suits mean solid shirts . <p> " The least perilous way to stylishly wear a checked suit is to wear a solid shirt and a striped tie that matches the colors of the suit , " says Flusser . " Let 's use a black-and-gray checked suit , for example . Wear a crisp white shirt and a black-and-gray striped tie , and you 're set . " RULE #4 Your tie should be darker than your shirt . <p> Unless you 're a hit man or a boxing promoter , your tie should almost always be darker than your shirt . " The darker the tie , the dressier it is , " says Flusser . " It 's the shirt 's job to offer contrast from the darker suit . " So let your shirt do its job . RULE #5 Your shoes should match your belt in color and material . <p> " You can never go wrong with this approach , " says Adam Derrick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a no-brainer . " Black leather shoes , black leather belt . Brown suede shoes , brown suede belt . Fluorescent red clown shoes , fluorescent red water-squirting clown belt . Simple , right ? RULE #6 Your socks should relate to your pants more than they relate to your shoes . <p> Fred Astaire always wore brightly colored socks when he was dancing because it drew attention to his feet . " You do n't want to draw attention to your feet , " says Derrick , " so the pant leg and the sock should form a line of color leading to the shoe . " RULE #7 If you 're wearing a suit , tie ' em up . <p> According to Derrick , if you 're wearing a classic suit or serious pants and blazer combo ( gray pants , blue jacket ) , it should be worn with a classic lace-up shoe . RULE #8 When you want to look like a sport , start with the shirt . <p> If you like the sporty , no-tie look for Friday at the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt . " For the most simple color arrangement , go with a shirt that has two colors , " says Flusser . " Let 's say you start with a shirt that 's a medium blue and tan combination . You could go with solid khakis to work the tan in the shirt and a navy sweater or jacket to pick up the blue . " RULE #9 Patterned sport jackets require two solids . <p> If on that sporty , no-tie day you reach into the closet and pull out a patterned jacket , keep the rest simple . Wear a solid color shirt that matches the lighter color in the pattern , and solid pants that relate to the darker color . RULE #10 Do n't mix and match seasons . <p> Let 's say you love the feel of linen pants and , while you 're getting dressed to go to the office Christmas party , you think it would be really groovy if you wore your white linen pants with your favorite sweater . You have two options : Forget about it or stay home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become more blurred over the years , " says New York-based designer Sal Cesarani . " However , there are still a few rules you should heed . " <p> Here 's a list of things that you should wear only between Memorial Day and Labor Day : linen and linen/rayon blend pants and jackets ; white wool or tropical summer-weight wool ; silk ( or silk/rayon blend ) shirts ; silk jackets ; seersucker pants , shirts and jackets ; madras shirts . And , if you have a fancy for white bucks , put them in the closet come Labor Day as well . <p> NOTE : If you find yourself poolside in the Caribbean , chatting up some island girl and sipping banana daiquiris , the above advice does not apply . Indeed , if that sounds like your life , maybe you should be the one giving us advice . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Rule #1 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) What pattern tie ? Depends on the stripe of the skirt . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Rule #3 <p> PHOTO ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Leather shoes = leather belt .
