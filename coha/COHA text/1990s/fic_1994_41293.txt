At the time of Babette , my grandfather was not yet twenty . Although today , and perhaps even then , such youth is not necessarily married to innocence , in his case it was . There were boys his age who had already served in the war and returned , but he was not among them for the unromantic reason that one of his feet was several sizes larger than the other . Outfitting him with boots would have inconvenienced the United States Army enough that he was not selected , and he passed the war years , as before , in the company of his elderly great-aunt . <p> On this particular Wednesday night , he chose not to tell his aunt where he was going . This was not out of deviousness , for he was not by nature a liar . Rather , he believed that she would not have understood or even heard him in the advanced stage of her senility . He did ask the neighbor , a widow with bad knees , to look in on his aunt throughout the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a boxing match the month before , and had briefly , late one Saturday , stood in the doorway of a loud and dangerous local bar , so this was not his first attempt to observe a seediness he had never known . He learned little out of those first two experiences , however , except that the smell of tobacco smoke dings stubbornly to hair and clothing . He had higher hopes for this evening . <p> The nightclub he found was considerably darker inside than the street outside had been . It was an early show , a weekday show , but the place had already filled with a shifting , smoking audience of men . The few lights around the orchestra dimmed just as he entered , and he was forced to feel his way to a seat , stepping over feet and knees in the aisle . He tried not to actually touch people , but brushed nonetheless against wool and skin with every move until he found an empty seat and took it . <p> " Time ? " a voice beside him demanded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The time ? " the voice questioned again . My grandfather asked quietly , " Are you talking to me ? " <p> There was a sudden spotlight on the stage , and the question was forgotten . Babette began to sing , although at that time , of course , he did not know her name . When his eyes adjusted to the glaring white light , it was only the color of her dress that he saw  --  a vivid green that today we call lime . It is a color decidedly not found in nature , but is manufactured now artificially for the dying of paint , clothing , and food . It can not shock us anymore , we are too familiar with it . In 1919 , however , there were not yet cars to be found in that shade , or small houses in the suburbs , or , one would suspect , fabric . <p> Nonetheless , Babette wore it , sleeveless and short . My grandfather did not at first even notice that she was singing on account of that vivid lime-green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is almost petty to say so , as musical ability was clearly not required for her job . What she did , and did well , was move in swaying , dancing steps on very pleasant legs . Novelists writing only a decade before that night still referred to beautiful women as having " rounded , well-shaped arms . " By the end of World War I , however , fashion had changed such that other features were now visible , and arms got considerably less attention than they once had . This was unfortunate , for Babette 's arms were lovely , perhaps even her best feature . My grandfather , however , was not very modern , even as a young man , and he noticed Babette 's arms appreciatively . <p> The lights at the back of the stage had risen , and there were several dancing couples now behind Babette . They were adequate , efficient dancers  --  the men slender and dark , the women in short , swinging dresses . The nature of the lighting muted the shades of their clothing into uniform browns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than note their presence and then resume staring at Babette . <p> He was not familiar enough with show business to know that what he was watching was the insignificant opening : act of what would be a long , bawdy night of performance . This particular number was no more than an excuse to open the curtain on something other than an empty stage , to warm up the small orchestra , and to alert the audience that the evening was commencing . There was nothing risque about Babette except the length of her hemline , and it is likely that my grandfather was the only member of the audience who felt any excitement at what he was watching . It is almost certain that none of the other men around him were clutching at their trousers with damp hands , or moving their lips , silently searching for words to describe that dress , those arms , that startling red hair and lipstick . Most of the audience had already heard the song on a recording made by a prettier , more talented girl than Babette , but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls . <p> When the performers bowed and the lights dimmed , he jumped from his seat , and moved quickly back over the men in his row , stepping on feet , stumbling , apologizing for his clumsiness in a low , constant murmur . He felt his way up the center aisle and to the heavy doors that threw quick triangles of light onto the floor behind him as he pushed them open . He ran into the lobby and caught an usher by the arm . <p> " I need to speak with the singer , " he said . <p> The usher , my grandfather 's age , but a veteran of the war in France , asked , " Who ? " <p> " The singer . The one with the red , the red  --  " He pulled at his own hair in frustration . <p> " The redhead , " the usher finished . <p> " Yes . " <p> " She 's with the visiting troupe . " <p> " Yes , good , good , " my grandfather said , nodding foolishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need with her ? " <p> " I need to speak with her , " he repeated . <p> Perhaps the usher , seeing that my grandfather was sober and young , thought that he was a messenger boy , or perhaps he only wanted to be left alone . In any case , he led him to Babette 's room , which was under the stage in a dark , door-lined hall . <p> " Someone here to see you , miss , " he said , knocking twice and then leaving before she answered . <p> Babette opened the door and looked down the hall to the departing usher , and then to my grandfather . She wore a slip , and had a large pink towel wrapped around her shoulders like a shawl . <p> " Yes ? " she asked , lifting her high , arched eyebrows even higher . <p> " I need to speak with you , " my grandfather said . <p> She looked him over . He was tall and pale , in a clean , inexpensive suit , and he carried his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football . He had a bad habit of stooping , but now , out of nervousness , was standing perfectly straight . This posture helped his appearance somewhat , forcing his chin out and lending his shoulders a width they did not generally seem to have . There was nothing about him which would have compelled Babette to shut the door in his face , so she remained there before him in her slip and towel . <p> " Yes ? " she asked again . <p> " I want to paint you , " he said , and she frowned and took a step back . My grandfather thought with alarm that she had misunderstood him to mean that he wanted to apply paint to her bodily , as one would paint a house or a wall , and horrified , he explained , " I meant that I would like to paint a picture of you , a portrait of you ! " <p> " Right now ? " she asked , and he answered quickly , " No , no , not now . But I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " You 're a painter ? " she asked . <p> " Oh , I 'm terrible , " my grandfather said . " I 'm a terrible painter , I 'm ghastly . " <p> She laughed at him . " I 've already had my picture painted by several artists , " she lied . <p> " Certainly you have , " he said . <p> " You saw me sing ? " she asked , and he said that he had indeed . <p> " You are n't staying for the rest of the show ? " she asked , and he paused before answering , realizing only then that there was a show other than what he had seen . <p> " No , " he said . " I did n't want to miss you . I was afraid you might leave right away <p> She shrugged . " I do n't let men into my dressing room . " <p> " Of course you do n't ! " he said , hoping he had not insinuated that he expected an invitation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to stand in this hallway and talk to you , " she continued . <p> My grandfather said , " I 'm sorry that I disturbed you , " and unfolded his overcoat to put it on . <p> " What I mean is that if you want to talk to me , you 're just going to have to come inside , " Babette explained . <p> " I could n't , I did n't mean to  --  " <p> But she had already stepped back into the small , poorly lit room , and was holding the door open for him to enter . He followed her in , and when she shut the door , he leaned up against it , anxious to intrude as little as possible . Babette pulled an old piano stool over to the sink , and looked at herself in a silver hand mirror . She ran the water until it was hot , dampened two fingers , and pressed a curl just behind her ear back into shape . Then she looked at my grandfather over her shoulder . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was that you wanted . " <p> " I wanted to draw you , to paint you . " <p> " But you say you 're no good . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " You should n't say that , " Babette said . " If you 're going to be something , if you 're going to be someone , you 've got to start telling people that you 're good . " <p> " I ca n't , " he said . " I 'm not . " <p> " Well , it 's easy enough to say that you are . Go on , say it . Say , ' I am a good artist . ' Go on . " <p> " I ca n't , " he repeated . " I 'm not one . " <p> She picked an eyebrow pencil off the edge of the sink and tossed it to him . <p> " Draw something , " she said . <p> " Where ? " <p> " Anywhere . On this wall , on that wall , anywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Go on , " she said . " It 's not as if you could make this room look any worse , if that 's what you 're worried about . " <p> He found a spot next to the sink where the paint was n't too badly chipped or marked with graffiti . Slowly , he began to draw <p> hand holding a fork . Babette stood behind him , leaning forward , watching over his shoulder . <p> " It 's not a good angle for me , " he said , but she did not answer , so he continued . He added a man 's forearm and wristwatch . <p> " It 's smudging like that because the pencil is so soft , " he apologized , and she said , " Stop talking about it . Just finish it . " <p> " It is finished He stepped back . " It 's already finished . " <p> She looked at him , and then at the sketch . " But that 's just a hand . There 's no person , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . I told you I was no good . " <p> " No . " Babette said . " I think you 're very good . I think this is an excellent hand and fork . From just this I 'd let you paint my portrait . It 's just that it 's a queer thing to draw on a wall , do n't you think ? " <p> " I do n't know , " he said . " I never drew on a wall before . " <p> " Well , it 's a nice drawing , " Babette decided . " I think you 're <p> good artist . " <p> " Thank you . " <p> " You should tell me that I 'm a good singer now . " <p> " But you are ! " he said . " You 're wonderful . " <p> " Are n't you sweet to say so , " Babette smiled graciously . " But I 'm really not . There are no good singers in places like this . There are some fine dancers , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible singer . " <p> He did n't know what to say to this , but she was looking at him as if it was his turn to speak , so he asked , " What 's your name ? " <p> " Babette , " she said . " And when a girl criticizes herself , you really should crawl to the ends of the earth to contradict her , you know . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I did n't know . " <p> She looked at herself in the mirror again . " So do you want to only paint my hand ? " she asked . " I have n't got a fork with me . " <p> " No , " he said . " I want to paint you , all of you , surrounded by black , surrounded by a whole crowd of black . But then there will be a white light , and you in the center "  --  he lifted his hands to show placement in an imaginary frame  --  " in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should 've seen that green and that red . " <p> " Well , it 's just the dress you like , then , " she said . " Just the dress and the hair . " <p> And your arms , he thought , but only nodded . <p> " None of that is really me , though , ' Babette said . " Even my hair is fake . " <p> " Fake ? " <p> " Yes . Fake . Dyed . Please do n't look so shocked . Really , you ca n't have ever seen this color hair before . " <p> " No ! " my grandfather almost shouted . " I never had . I think that 's exciting , that you can make it that way if you like . I wondered about it , but I did n't think , of course , that it had been dyed . <p> I think that there are so many colors I 've never seen  --  could I touch it ? " <p> " No , " Babette said . She reached for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its teeth . She handed it to him . " You can have this one piece . I 'm sure that I do n't know you well enough to let you drag your hands all over my head He carried the strand to the lamp and stretched it taut under the bulb , frowning in concentration . <p> " It 's brown at one end , " he said . <p> " That 's the new growth , " she explained . <p> " Your real hair ? " <p> " The whole thing is my real hair . That brown is my real color <p> " Just like mine , " he said in surprise . " But you 'd never know it to see you onstage . I tell you , you 'd never imagine we two would have the same sort of hair . Is n't that remarkable ? " <p> Babette shrugged . " I would n't say it was remarkable . But I suppose I 'm used to my hair , " <p> " Yes , I suppose you are . " <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . <p> " Yes , I am . I 've always lived here . " <p> " Well , you do n't act like it . You act just like a little boy from the country . Do n't be put off by that , now . It 's not a bad thing . " <p> " I think it is . I think it 's awful . It comes of not talking to enough people . " <p> " What do you do all day , then ? " <p> " I work in the back of a print shop sometimes . And I live with my great-aunt . " <p> " And she 's very old , " Babette said . <p> " Yes . And senile . All she can remember anymore are the names of flowers and girls . " <p> " What ? " <p> " The names of flowers and girls . I do n't know why , but that 's how it 's become . If I ask her a question , she thinks and thinks , but then finally she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Daisy , Emily , Iris , Violet ... ' " <p> " No ! " Babette said . " I think that 's remarkable . She must be very pretty to listen to . " <p> " Sometimes . Sometimes it 's just sad , because I can see how frustrated she is . Other times she just lets herself talk and strings them altogether : ' **37;278;TOOLONG Glory-Poppy-Lily-Rose . " Then it 's pretty to listen to . " <p> " I 'm sure that it is , " Babette said . " You forget how many flower 's names are girl 's names , too . " <p> " Yes , " my grandfather nodded . " I 've noticed that , also . " <p> " She used to take care of you , did n't she ? " " Yes , " he said . " When I was young . " " You still are young , " Babette laughed . " I 'm even young , and I think I 'm much older than you . " <p> " I could n't imagine how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ' <p> " I can see why you would n't Babette lifted her mirror again and looked at herself . " All this makeup covers everything . It 's hard to tell what I look like at all . I think I am pretty , anyway , but I only realized this week that I 'm not going to age well . Some women I know look like girls their whole lives , and I suspect that it 's on account of their skin . From a distance I still look fine , and onstage I 'll look wonderful for years , but if you come close to me , you 'll see the change already . " <p> She jumped up and ran in two steps to the opposite corner of the room from my grandfather . <p> " You see , I 'm just heavenly from here , " she said , and then leapt right up to him so that their noses almost touched . " But now look at me . See the little lines here , and here ? " She pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing like lines , only quickly blinking lashes and makeup . He noticed that her breath smelled of cigarettes and oranges , and then he stopped breathing , afraid that he might touch her somehow , or do something wrong . She took a step back , and he exhaled . <p> " But it 's like that with everything you look at too closely , " Babette continued . The green dress that she had worn earlier was hanging over a low ceiling pipe . She pulled the dress down , and backed into the far corner again , holding it up against herself . " Just look at this lovely green thing , " she said . " Onstage it 'll turn a man 's head , wo n't it ? And I looked so swish in it , did n't you think ? " <p> My grandfather said that he had thought just that . She approached him again , although , to his relief , did not stand so close this time . <p> " But you can see what a cheap thing it really is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It looks just like a child sewed those seams , and it 's all kept together with pins . And feel it . Go on . " <p> My grandfather lifted a bit of the skirt in one hand , although he did not really feel the material as he had been told to . <p> " You can tell right away that it 's not really silk , that there is n't actually anything nice about it at all . If I wore this to someone 's home , I would look just like some kind of street girl . It 's pathetic . " She turned from him , and then , over her shoulder , she added , " I will spare you the smell of the thing . I 'm certain that you can imagine it . " <p> Actually , he could n't begin to imagine what it smelled like . Cigarettes and oranges , he suspected , but he had no way of knowing . Babette let her pink towel slide to the floor , and then turned and faced my grandfather in only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I look very nice this way , " she said , " although I do n't have a large mirror , so I 'm not sure . But if <p> were to take this slip off , and if you were to come over here next to me , you 'd see that I have all sorts of bumps and hairs and freckles , and you might be very disappointed . You 've never seen <p> naked woman , have you ? " <p> " Yes , I have , " he said , and Babette looked at him in quick surprise . <p> " You have never , " she said sharply . " You have never in your life . " <p> " I have . It 's been three years now that my aunt ca n't care for herself . I keep her clean , change her clothes , give her baths . " <p> Babette grimaced . " I think that must be disgusting . " She picked up the towel from the floor and wrapped it around her shoulders again . " She probably ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with nasty messes . " <p> " I keep her very clean , " he said . " I make sure that she  --  " <p> " No Babette held up her hands . " I ca n't listen to that , any of that . I 'll be sick , really I will . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " my grandfather said . " I did n't mean  --  " <p> " That does n't disgust you ? To do those things ? " she interrupted . <p> " No , " he said honestly . " I think it must be just like taking care of a baby , do n't you ? " <p> " No . Absolutely not . Is n't that funny , though , that I would be so disgusted by what you just told me ? I 'm sure there are things in my life that would shock you , but I did n't think that you could shock me . " <p> " I did n't mean to shock you , " he apologized . " I was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you something shocking , " she said . " When I was <p> little girl in Elmira , we lived next to a very old man , a Civil War veteran . He had his arm amputated during a battle , but he would n't let the surgeon throw it away . Instead , he kept it , let all the skin rot off , dried it in the sun , and took it home . A souvenir . He kept it until he died . He used to chase his grandchildren around the yard with it , and then beat them with his own arm bone . And one time he sat me down and showed me the tiny crack from where he 'd broken it when he was a boy . So do you think that 's disgusting ? " <p> " No , " my grandfather said . " It 's interesting . I never met anyone from the Civil War . " <p> " Now that 's funny , " Babette said , " because everyone I ever told that to was shocked , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you talk about cleaning up your old aunt ? " <p> " I do n't know , " he said . " Except that your story was a lot more interesting . " <p> " I did n't think I still could be disgusted , " she said . " I 'll tell you another story . The church in my hometown used to have ice cream socials for the children , and we would eat so much that we would get sick . But it was such a treat that we wanted more , so we used to go outside , vomit what we 'd eaten , then run back in for more . Pretty soon all the dogs in town would be at the church , eating up that melting ice cream as fast as we could throw it up . Do you think that 's disgusting ? " <p> " No , " my grandfather said . " I think that 's funny . " <p> " So do I. I did then , and I still do She was quiet for a moment , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have seen in the last few years that would make you sick to hear . I could shock you . I 've done things that are so awful I would n't tell you about them if you begged me to . " <p> " I would n't do that . I do n't want to know , " he said , although when he had left his home that evening , he had wanted to know just that sort of information , desperately . <p> " It 's not important , anyhow . We wo n't talk about it at all . You 're a funny one , though , are n't you ? I feel just like an old whore saying that . There are so many old whores in this business , and they all look at young men and say , ' You 're a funny one , are n't you ? ' It 's true , though , with you . Most men get a sniff of a girl 's past , and want to know every single thing she 's ever done . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to . " <p> My grandfather blushed . " I 'm sorry if I stared , " he said . <p> " But not just at me ! You 've been staring at the whole room . I 'll bet you 've memorized every crack on these walls , the rungs on the bed frame , and what I 've got in the bottom of my suitcases , too . " <p> " No . " <p> " Yes you have . And you 've been memorizing me . I 'm sure of it He did not answer her , because , of course , she was absolutely right . Instead , he nervously shifted his weight back and forth , suddenly acutely aware of the different sizes of his feet . Not for the first time in his life , he felt unbalanced from the ground up because of this deformity , almost dizzy from it . <p> " Now I 've made you flustered , " Babette said . " I think that 's easy enough to do , so I wo n't be proud After a pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artist because of how you 've been staring . You 're a watcher , not a listener , am I right ? " <p> " I do n't know what you mean , " he said . <p> " Hum me a bar from my song tonight , or even tell me a line from the chorus . Go on . " <p> He thought back quickly , and at first could only come up with the sound of the faceless man beside him demanding the time . Then he said , " You sang something about being blue because someone left , a man , I think ... " He trailed off , then added weakly , " It was a pretty song . You sang it well , " <p> She laughed . " It 's just as well that you did n't listen . It 's a stupid song . But tell me , how many couples were dancing behind me ? " <p> " Four , " he answered without hesitation . <p> " And who was the smallest girl on stage ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orchestra ? " <p> " I could n't see , except the conductor , and the bass player , of course , because he was standing . " <p> " Yes , of course Babette walked to the sink , and spent a few moments doing something with the toiletries there . Then she turned and approached him with one arm outstretched . She had striped the white underside of her forearm with five short strokes of lipstick , each shade only slightly different than the one before it . She covered her mouth with her other hand and asked , " Which color do I have on my lips right now ? " <p> My grandfather looked down at her arm , unexpectedly alarmed at the slashes of red across white skin . He paused before answering because something else had caught his eye , a faint , bluish vein that ran diagonally across the inside bend of her elbow . Then he pointed to the second lipstick stripe from her wrist and said assuredly , almost absently , " This one . " <p> He looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the intriguing blue vein vanished from view . She was still holding her other hand to her mouth , and staring at him with eyes so wide and spooked that it seemed as if the hand belonged to a stranger , an attacker . He slowly pulled her arm down away from her face , and looked at her in silence . He looked at her lips and confirmed that he had chosen correctly . Without thinking about what he was beginning to do , he lifted her chin so that her face was out of shadow , and studied the shape of her forehead , nose , and jaw . Babette watched him . <p> " Look , " she said . " If you 're going to kiss me , just  --  " <p> She stopped talking as he released her chin and took hold of her wrist , turning it over and exposing where she had marked herself with the lipsticks . He stared for a long while , and she finally began to rub at the smearing red lines with the corner of her towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But my grandfather was n't looking at that . He was studying that faint blue vein again , examining its short path across its cradle , the soft fold of her arm . After some time , he lifted her other arm and compared the twin vein there , holding her wrists gently , but with a thorough self absorption that negated the lightness of his touch . She pulled away , and he released his hold without speaking . <p> He crossed the room and looked once more at the dress , carefully noting the alarming green again , frowning . Then he returned to Babette to confirm the color of her hair . He reached up to touch it , but she caught his arm . <p> " Please , " she said . " That 's enough . " <p> My grandfather blinked , and stared at her blankly , as if she had just woken him from a nap , or delivered a piece of unexpected bad news . He glanced around the room as though searching for someone else , someone more familiar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You should know that there are ways to act , " she said evenly . " There are things to say so that a girl does n't have to feel so used . " Her face was empty of expression , but she had lifted the hand mirror , and was holding it tightly , as one might hold a tennis racket , or a weapon . <p> He blushed then , realizing . " I 'm sorry , " he stammered . " I did n't mean ... I get that way sometimes , looking , staring like that  --  " <p> Babette cut him off with a sharp , irritated glance that crossed her face as fast and dark as a shadow . <p> " You ca n't do that to people , " she said . He started to apologize , but she shook her head . Finally she continued , " It 's going to be a very good painting , but not very flattering to me . Which is fine , " she added , shrugging cavalierly , " because I 'll never see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated , feeling and sounding like a stranger again , as if he was once more standing outside her door in the dark , cobwebbed hall beneath the stage . <p> She shrugged once more , and lifted a hand to touch a red curl that was already in place . My grandfather watched , silent . <p> " Do n't you think you should leave now ? " Babette asked at last . <p> He nodded grimly , disgusted by the futility of apology , and left . He found his way through the dark hall and out of the nightclub alone , not needing , or even remembering , the young usher who had led him to Babette . Outside it had stopped raining . His overcoat had dried in her room , and he had already forgotten that it had ever been wet . <p> The widow with the bad knees was waiting for him when he got home . She did not question where he had been , but said only that his aunt was asleep in her chair , and had been quiet all night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered as he unlocked the door . <p> " Thank you , " he said . " You 're very kind . " <p> My grandfather closed the door quietly behind him and took off his shoes so that he would n't wake his aunt when he passed through the sitting room . In his own bedroom , he began working on what would be the first important painting of his career . He filled several pages with the charcoal-smudged , faceless crowd of the nightclub audience , leaving a glaringly empty white space in each sketch , always in the same spot . After several hours , he examined his work , irritated to see that all of the pictures were identical : uniformly solid and dark with a gaping opening in the center for a singer he did n't know how to begin to draw . <p> He laid his head down on his sleeve and shut his eyes . He breathed in the tobacco smell of his shirt , at first inadvertently , and then with great purpose , as if his skill would be enhanced by deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he opened his small box of oil paints and began to try mixing the green of Babette 's dress . Although later in his life his mastery of color would be considered unrivaled , that night , as a young man with a limited collection of oils , he was overwhelmed by the task of precisely recalling that shade . He worked carefully , and several times felt that he was close to success , but found that , as the paint dried , the effect was lost , the color dulled He was struck by the inevitability of his own limitations . <p> His desk was covered already with torn pieces of paper and patches of sticky , inadequate green . He looked at the charcoal sketches again , and thought about what Babette had said . She was correct to say that it would be a good painting , but wrong to think that it would not flatter her . My grandfather visualized the figure that he knew would eventually fill the empty white space , and he was certain that it would be a very appealing character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , to always be a clumsy rendition of a transient , fantastic moment . It was he , ultimately , who would not be flattered by this work . It was his misfortune to realize this so young , and so completely . <p> He heard a sound , and set his sketchbook quietly down on the floor . His aunt was talking , and he wondered how long she had been awake . He went into the sitting room , where he turned on a small reading lamp . She was rocking slowly , and he listened for <p> while to her mumbling . <p> " Black-eyed Susan , " she said , " Grace , Anna , Marigold , Pansy , Sarah ... " <p> She had become smaller with age . In this lighting , however , with dark blankets over her legs and embroidered pillows around her , she appeared stately , if not strong . My grandfather sat at her feet like a child waiting for a story . <p> " Lady's-slipper , Rosehip , Faith , Zinnia , Cowbell , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stopped talking . She laid her hand on his head and kept it there , where it trembled with the constant palsy of old age . He began to fall asleep , and , in fact , had dozed off when she woke him by saying , " Baby . " He half-opened his eyes without lifting his head , not sure what he had heard . <p> She repeated the word , and then again and again , in the same low tone as her strange , rambling lists . <p> " Baby , baby , baby , " she said , and in his distracted exhaustion , he misunderstood her . He believed that she was saying " Babette , " over and over . Of all the flowers and girls , he thought , it was this rich , painful name that she had finally settled on to repeat and repeat and repeat . <p> He closed his eyes again . Even shut , they ached , as if somehow they had been forced to look on him self in sixty years : elderly and dying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to him , calling them all Babette . <p>
