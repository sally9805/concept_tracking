##@x <p> In the month since she has taken over women 's golf , Meg Mallon has made plenty of big putts . But none of them have been bigger than the one she made four weeks ago , at a point when it looked as if she did n't want the job at the top . <p> When the 28-year-old Mallon came to the 71st hole of the Ladies Professional Golf Association Championship with a one-shot lead over her veteran playing partners , Pat Bradley and Ayako Okamoto , it was as a one-time winner who had never finished better than 27th on the tour 's money list . <p> After she left a 60-foot uphill birdie putt 12 feet short and then gunned the next one 4 feet past the hole , it appeared Mallon was beating a hasty retreat back to obscurity . <p> " Here I am just putting the screws in myself , and my hands are the shakiest they had been , " the exuberant Mallon recalled , rapidly wiggling her fingers to make her point . " I know everyone is thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But instead of short-circuiting , Mallon switched on her strengths  --  clarity , concentration and perspective  --  and found the resolve that has made her the hottest player in women 's golf . <p> " I was into that moment , " she said . " It was neat to feel my body reacting . If you do n't get that feeling , you are not really out there . " <p> This putt went in the center of the cup for a bogey . And on the next hole , a dramatic 15-foot birdie putt gave Mallon a one-shot victory . Two weeks later at the United States Women 's Open in Fort Worth , Mallon holed three long birdie putts on the final nine and another one downhill for a par on the 70th hole to run away from Bradley and Amy Alcott . <p> By winning the two major championships , Mallon became the first twentysomething player to enter the L.P.G.A. 's dominating bloc of veterans headed by Beth Daniel , Bradley , Betsy King and Patty Sheehan . And all the while , Mallon was wrinkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's golf has n't seen since the salad days of Nancy Lopez . <p> The clutch finishes and finishing touches have brought the kind of attention from the fans that the L.P.G.A. craves , and Mallon , who developed a quick wit and quick maturity growing up as the youngest of six siblings , has been equal to the part . <p> " I 've always been kind of a team player in other sports , and the only team aspect I get to engage in out here is to root for the tour as a whole , " she said a few days ago , in the midst of competing in the Bay State Classic here , in which she eventually tied for third . <p> Being the tour 's new front woman has its price , the ironies of which have not been lost on Mallon . " I used to love talking on the phone ; now I 'm starting to hate it , " she said . " I 've always been good at listening , but now everybody wants me to talk about myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession where wanting to be a star as quickly as possible is considered imperative , this rise has happened to a balanced , unobsessed person whose overriding goal has been slow , steady improvement . <p> " Is n't it funny ? " said Mallon , who sees the humor in most things . " I never had any intention of anything like this . I thought I might sneak in and win , maybe . " <p> " I think I 've become good at focusing and concentrating when I 'm nervous , " Mallon reluctantly conceded . <p> " I 'm a firm believer that you make your own luck , and attitude has a lot to do with it , " she said . " If you carry a good attitude into things , 9 times out of 10 they are going to turn out fairly well . " <p> " I think Meg 's the kind of person probably a lot of people feel like a close friend to , " said King , an admitted introvert who has been drawn out by Mallon . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Margaret Mary Elizabeth Mallon developed her personality in a large , supportive family . Her father , John , was an employee of Ford Motor Company in Boston and Detroit who came into contact with professional athletes through promotional work . As a child , Meg played catch with Earl Wilson of the Detroit Tigers and watched her father and brothers shoot baskets with Bob Cousy in the driveway of the family 's Birmingham , Mich. , home . <p> Mallon , who now lives in California , took a calm and measured approach to her profession after leaving Ohio State , where she attained moderate success as a college golfer . She joined the L.P.G.A. Tour in 1987 , but won only $1,572 in 18 events , never finishing a tournament in the top 60 . She requalified the next year , and improved significantly through her work with Mike McGetrick , the head teaching pro at Cherry Hills in Denver , who is the husband of the L.P.G.A. player Sara Anne McGetrick . She finished 87th on the money list and lowered her average score by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was still looking for her first victory at the beginning of the year . It came in February at the Oldsmobile L.P.G.A. Classic in Florida . <p> On the final two holes , Mallon displayed the same ability to raise her game under pressure that would win her the 1991 L.P.G.A. and the Open . She hit a 5-wood to the 17th , and a 3-iron to the 18th , both over water and into the wind , to within 6 feet . She closed out each of her two majors with flawless 5-iron shots to the final holes . <p> Mallon will be shooting at her third major of the year in September at the du Maurier Classic . " Now I think is when the really big challenge comes , " she said . " Things are going a little fast now . I 've got to slow things down and put it all in perspective . Put it on my time , like I did before . I do n't want this year to become a burden for the rest of my career . Hopefully I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if Mallon does , the L.P.G.A. will indeed have a new superstar . @@649963 Regina Wheeler brushed her hand against the expensive bronze metallic leather clutch and shivered as instant euphoria coursed through her body . Designer handbags , clutches , totes , and shoulder bags were her passion  --  an obsession of monumental proportion . She could eye spy a knockoff with just a glance . Her designer collection hung on the backs of three of her closet doors , were stacked in boxes on shelves inside closets and drawers in the spare bedrooms , and there was even a secret stash in the basement . <p> She could n't resist fondling and inhaling the soft leather once more before paying for the stylish clutch . <p> Unfortunately , she would n't have the luxury of putting her latest acquisition on display in her bedroom where her eyes could feast upon it . Not wanting to hear the words " Another expensive bag ? " from her husband 's lips , Regina would have to conceal her purchase . This new beauty would have to be hidden in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of colorful bags covered with protective plastic . <p> And when she decided to carry the metallic clutch , Matt would roll his gaze to the ceiling . " Is that new ? " he 'd ask suspiciously . Regina would reply ever so innocently , " No , honey . I bought this last year . " He 'd frown and mumble in dissatisfaction , but her denial would quash an endless sermon about frivolous spending and how they needed to tighten their budget . At that point , Regina would solemnly agree to cut back on spending and the bronze metallic clutch would join the other beautiful bags displayed in their bedroom . <p> At home , Regina clicked on the basement light and bounced down the stairs . One of these days she and Matt were going to invest in getting the basement remodeled to give it a finished look  --  add a powder room , plasma TV , pool table , the works . Matt always complained that if it were n't for all the money Regina spent on her obsession the basement could have been refinished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cedar closet , ran her hand across the surface in reverence . Treasured possessions that had belonged to her son  --  his favorite toys and items of clothing that she 'd cherished and was unable to part with  --  were stored inside the cedar closet , which was kept padlocked . <p> She kept her collection inside that sacred place , also . It was a good hiding place ; her husband would never go snooping inside the cedar closet . Too many painful memories were locked within . <p> In fact , her husband hardly ever descended the basement stairs . He did n't have the time to fiddle with the manly tools and gadgets that occupied the basement . Working a full-time job , running a business , and training employees was more than enough work for one man , he 'd told his wife . So Regina , finding herself unable to fit another item inside the cedar closet , figured she could hide the narrow box containing the bronze clutch in the storage area where her husband kept his neglected tools . <p> She rearranged some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shelf where it would be undetected . Though the box was small , she could n't push it out of view ; something was in the way . Standing on her tiptoes and stretching her arm as far as she could , she used the tips of her fingers to retrieve a package that crinkled as she pulled it out of its hiding place . <p> It was a shiny bag with a T-Mobile logo . Regina snatched open the bag . Curious and slightly disturbed , she scrutinized the packaged cell phone . The state-of-the-art device came equipped with internet access and a host of features . Matt must have intended to give the phone to his seventeen-year-old nephew , Eric . <p> Regina frowned in thought . Matt had already given Eric a cell phone . Granted , the manufacturers came out with newer models at a rapid rate , but she and Matt did n't make the kind of money required to keep up with modern technology . She was surprised that Matt , usually frugal to the point of being obnoxiously stingy , would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive , upgraded model . Sure , Eric was his favorite nephew but it was n't as if he were their own son . <p> Our son . Regina 's eyes watered instantly . Her little boy  --  her baby  --  would have been close to Eric 's age now . He 'd be in high school . She wondered how he 'd look  --  how he 'd behave as a teen . Would he have remained as sweet , as good-natured as he 'd been as a child ? Frowning , she shook her head , trying to rid her mind of painful memories . But it was too late  --  images of her little boy 's face began to flash like a fast-moving slide show . <p> " Devon , " she cried aloud as she was hit by a pang of yearning so severe it was almost disabling . Clutching her heart , Regina slumped against the storage bin . <p> Though she was alone in the house , Regina wept quietly . Her tears , like her designer bags , were kept secret . Crying over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Life goes on , " well-meaning friends had told her . <p> Life goes on ? Maybe so for other people . Even Matt had found a way to cope . He seemed to have replaced Devon with his nephew , Eric . He played surrogate father to Eric , participating in all his academic and sporting events . Regina was fond of Eric but she could n't bring herself to dote on him as Matt did . It seemed unfair to Devon . <p> It took an hour for the sobbing session to end and when she finished crying , feeling purged , she straightened her shoulders and dried her eyes . She glanced at the T-Mobile package and shrugged . She 'd pretend she did n't know about the phone and wait until Matt was ready to reveal why he felt the need to indulge Eric with yet another hi-tech phone . <p> Matt had been employed at Boeing Helicopters in Ridley Park , Pennsylvania , since he was eighteen years old and right out of high school . Now , a year shy of his fortieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt had invested his life 's savings and had even taken out a loan , for which Regina had co-signed , to start a commercial cleaning business . He had a staff of four  --  three men and one woman  --  all recovering substance abusers . <p> Every evening at five-fifteen , Matt pulled up in his van and picked up the foursome on the corner of Ninth and Central Avenue in Chester , Pennsylvania . From there , he transported them to various commercial businesses in the tri-state area , where they were on a tight schedule to get the work done and then move on to the next building . <p> He usually dragged back home around midnight and was up again at six in the morning to start his day job at Boeing . It was grueling , but having his own business gave him a sense of purpose and seemed to brighten his life . <p> Though Regina had little faith in Matt 's ability to succeed in the cleaning industry his renewed zest for life was worth every dime of their joint life savings that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night because her pension at her job as a marketing manager at an insurance company , as well as her 401K account , were the back-up plan . <p> With Matt working such long hours , Regina 's life had become a little more tolerable . The best part of having a husband who worked sixteen hours a day was that he was too exhausted to harass her at night . Well , at least not as often as he used to . For the first few years of their marriage Regina  --  having had only one sex partner in her life  --  thought Matt 's undersized penis was normal . <p> Early in their marriage when sparks did n't fly , she 'd hoped that in time and with a little more experience , their love life would escalate to hot and steamy instead of remaining lukewarm . And boring . He 'd been a premature ejaculator from the beginning of their marriage , but Regina had learned to accept that as well . <p> It took two years for her to even admit to her husband that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with utter shock . " Why not ? " he asked accusingly as if there was something wrong with her . The sudden tension in the atmosphere caused Regina to back down . Sparing her husband the humiliation of being told that his equipment as well as his bedroom skills were lacking , Regina mumbled that she did n't know why she had never reached a climax . Protecting her man 's ego , she took the fall , which resulted in the unspoken conclusion that she , and not Matt , had a problem . <p> Over the years , Matt did nothing to improve their sex life . He continued to rush through foreplay and never bothered to experiment and find her pleasure points . After one sloppy kiss , he 'd run his hands impatiently over her breasts , squeeze her thighs , and then penetrate . After a few thrusts , he 'd ejaculate . His body would jerk spastically . He 'd groan so loud and for so long , Regina often feared that neighbors would think Matt was being attacked by a violent intruder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that post-intercourse commotion , one would have thought Matt had been stroking her long and hard . <p> Now he had a new dysfunction . In addition to being undersized and prone to pre-ejaculation , Matt could not maintain an erection . He 'd urge her to " play with it . " And when her halfhearted hand job failed to keep him hard , he 'd straddle her , rub his little dick on her tits , turn her over , and try to stuff it between her buttocks . When he finally became semi-erect , he 'd quickly turn her over on her back and pant like an animal as he desperately tried to force himself inside her . His semi-erect dick would slip out of her opening and Matt would quickly , desperately , stuff it back in . <p> She supposed her husband 's dick problems had desensitized her . Since he could n't deliver the goods , it would seem the decent thing to do would be for him to go on about his business and leave her alone . Sex with her husband had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture . <p> Until six months ago . That 's when she 'd finally put her foot down and threatened to move into another bedroom if Matt did n't get treatment . He needed Viagra or something for erectile dysfunction . " Go see a doctor or leave me alone , " she yelled , putting an end to what was beginning to feel like physical abuse . <p> Looking forlorn , Matt insisted his problem was stress related . A temporary situation . <p> Perhaps it was . Regina no longer cared . Having a limp penis humping hard against her vagina was a kind of torture she was no longer willing to endure . <p> At thirty-eight years old , Regina was at her sexual peak . She yearned to be aroused by extended foreplay . Her body ached for a substantially sized penis with girth and length that could produce heart-pounding , toe-curling orgasms . <p> Though she 'd thought about cheating , seeking out a secret lover who could provide her with good sex was something she could not bring herself to do . Stuck in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would grow old together . And most likely , the location of her G-spot would remain an undiscovered mystery . <p> " Are you planning on upgrading Eric 's phone ? " Regina asked as she piled left-over spaghetti onto her husband 's plate . To hell with waiting for Matt to bring up the subject . <p> Matthew Wheeler cocked his head and stared at the forkful of sauce-covered pasta . " What ? " <p> " The new cell phone in the basement , " she informed him . " It 's for Eric , is n't it ? " <p> " Oh ! " He nodded enthusiastically and shoveled in the food . Between chews , he added , " Yeah , you know how he likes all the latest gadgets . He told me the phone we bought him back in September is already obsolete . " Matt laughed heartily . <p> We ? Regina gave Matt a disapproving look . " I fail to see any humor in this . " <p> " What ? " Matt asked with a shrug . <p> " Since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have to tighten up our spending  --  is n't that what you tell me ? So why would you buy that boy a new phone just because he likes new gadgets ? Did n't you give him money for clothes , a cell phone , and an expensive laptop at the beginning of the school year ? " <p> Matt held up his hands in surrender . " You 're right . I know I go overboard for Eric . But he 's my only nephew ... " <p> Regina glared at Matt . <p> " All right . I 'll take the phone back tonight ; there 's a little strip mall with a T-Mobile store near one of my buildings . I just thought Eric would get a kick out of the new phone . " <p> Regina shook her head . " He has a mother , you know . Why do you have to indulge his every whim ? Ca n't your sister contribute anything for Eric ? " <p> Matt 's face hardened . The subject of his irrational commitment to his sister and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely approached . But today she felt righteously indignant . She had to hide handbags bought with money she earned while Matt doted on someone else 's child . <p> " Did I tell you Eric 's going to be working with me this summer when he gets out of school ? " Matt said cheerfully . <p> " No , you did n't mention it , " Regina mumbled , lips pressed together in irritation . " What does that have to do with the new phone ? " <p> " The new phone is on my plan . I can communicate with Eric at no extra charge . It 'll really come in handy if he 's working at one building while I 'm at another . As soon as he learns the ropes , I plan to make him supervisor . " <p> Regina rolled her eyes . " That boy 's never done one day of hard labor . Eric needs to focus on getting into college , not learn the necessary skills to supervise a pack of conniving lowlifes . My God , Matt , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the drug-related antics of your work crew . " <p> " What antics ? " Matt asked , his voice rising . " What do you know about my employees ? " <p> " I know that they 're all drug addicts and alcoholics . " <p> " My employees are all in recovery , Regina , " Matt said defensively . " They 're trying to get their lives together and they 're doing a fine job . " <p> " And their labor is cheap . That 's the best part of the deal , is n't it ? " she said sarcastically . <p> " What 's the real problem , Regina ? Are you upset because I 'm spending so much time away from home or are you jealous because I latched onto something that has the potential to change our status in life  --  something I can leave Eric . " <p> " I 'm not jealous . I realize long hours are part of the process . As far as your nephew 's concerned , maybe it 's comforting for you to play ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hardly ever speak your own son 's name . " For a moment Regina was quiet . " Would it kill you to say Devon 's name once in a while ? " <p> " What 's there to say ? Devon 's gone , " Matt said bitterly . " What do you want me to say ? " <p> " That you miss him , " she said with a whimper . <p> Matt did n't answer . Regina leaned against the counter and stared at the kitchen floor . <p> Matt finished his meal in silence . Regina immediately turned around and began stacking dishes in the dishwasher . Their marriage was failing  --  had failed years ago . Were they headed for divorce court ? Regina wanted to cry . Her husband 's love for her was so sincere and they 'd endured all the bumps in the road that life had thrown their way . But most important , he was faithful . Had always been . How many women could make that claim ? <p> She loved her husband , but she no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their relationship . And she despised the fact that he 'd replaced their son so easily . <p> Matt cleared his throat . " I just remembered . I have to get an oil change before I pick up my crew . With all the miles I 've been putting on the van , I do n't want to take any chances and mess up my engine . " He attempted to speak in a neutral tone , pretending there was n't tension in the room . <p> He wiped his mouth with a napkin and stood , reached in his pocket , and peeled off three fifties . " Buy yourself something a new purse or something . " Giving his wife a sad smile , he laid the money on the kitchen table . <p> It was his way of saying he was sorry about his seeming lack of regard for their son 's memory . Regina nodded sadly and turned back to the dishwasher . Matt patted her back apologetically and threw down another fifty on his way out the door . <p> Regina went upstairs and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denim wallet . She 'd add five hundred more and buy the Valentino braided tote that she 'd been lusting for . Even the prospect of spending money on a prized possession that she would n't have to hide did nothing to elevate her mood . <p> Grappling with a barrage of negative thoughts , Regina sat on her bed , clutched a pillow to her bosom , and rocked . But the rocking motion did not soothe her . She felt agitated . So agitated she snatched the pillow away from her chest , folded it , and stuck it between her legs . <p> Squeezing the pillow with her thighs , she closed her eyes and imagined being plundered by a vulgar faceless man who was hung like a horse . He forced himself inside her , smacking her face when she pleaded for him to be gentle  --  to have mercy . It was a wickedly delicious fantasy that made her juices overflow and soak through the pillowcase . <p> During her fantasy , she used crude language , making sexual demands she 'd never made with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Split my pussy wide open , " she shouted as her vaginal muscles contracted rapidly . " Goddamn ! " she screamed as she exploded . Her face was twisted in a grimace , her heart pounding loudly and pumping so hard , it frightened her . Gasping for breath , Regina rubbed her chest in a circular motion . Finally , the spasms subsided and Regina was catapulted back to the reality of her own bedroom , lying in her marital bed with a pillow stuffed between her legs . <p> She let out a long sigh . Her life was so sad . Pitiable . Her husband was sexually disabled and refused to seek help . She was so deprived she 'd resorted to fucking a damn pillow . Ashamed and feeling hopeless , she flung the pillow to the floor and quickly grabbed another , this time placing it on her face to muffle her sobs . She was certain that she loved her husband . After twenty years of marriage , he was like an extension of her , like an arm or leg , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dying inside . And it was Matt 's fault . He did n't care that his limp dick had never given her an orgasm . He was perfectly content to continue their macabre sex dance . She 'd talked about it and talked about it until she was blue in the face , but Matt was in denial . He said he was going through a phase  --  that he was anxious about his new business venture . Whatever ! The fact remained that she was an unfulfilled woman who was locked in a sexless marriage . <p> Sleeping with another man for sexual satisfaction was out of the question . How could she ever look at herself in the mirror if she broke her marriage vows ? And despite everything , she really loved Matt . <p> Regina exhaled . She 'd just have to exercise more patience . In the meantime , she 'd try to figure out a way to coerce Matt into getting professional help . He really needed to see a doctor . A sex therapist . An acupuncturist . Hell , she 'd send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help him keep his dick hard. 2009 by Allison Hobbs <br> Continues ...
