<p> What happens on the runways in Paris , Milan and New York sometimes also happens in the fashion stores where Houstonians do their shopping . And then again , sometimes it does n't . <p> We asked seven local fashion experts what Houstonians can expect to find when they hit the stores for fall shopping - what looks , colors , accessories and prices . We believe their answers may help you decide what direction your fall look will take . <p> LISA AARONSON <p> Fashion director for Saks Fifth Avenue , Houston <p> The Looks : " " The whole dandy Edwardian look , built around the great white shirt or a ruffled poet 's blouse is very strong , " said Aaronson . " " Over that would go a great velour or velvet vest and a wonderful jacket . <p> Fall wardrobes will be all about " " flexibility , easing up of the very structured look . Everything is very soft , flowing , not so padded on top but closer to the body , fitted at the waist but not exaggerated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The Colors : " " Black , midnight blue ( a dark shade that coordinates with black ) , browns , rusts , earth tones , brick and grays . Not a lot of brights . " <p> The Accessories : " " Edwardian , definitely . Skullcaps , newsboy caps , crosses dangling or up around the neck on a black velvet rope , dangling earrings but smaller , skinnier drops , maybe with stones . " <p> She also sees lace ruffs with cameos , detachable cuffs , button covers , fringed shawls and gloves . <p> The Prices : " " I think women are probably buying separates because they think they can go further , that they get more value for their dollar by wearing the pieces more often than they would one outfit worn the same all the time . " <p> Pictured : Karl Lagerfeld double-breasted jacket ( $ 1,635 ) , mesh top ( $ 560 ) and mesh-with-wool skirt ( $ 1,300 ) . Saks lace-up granny boots ( $ 125 ) with black opaque tights . <p> CRICKET KRUG <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Looks : " " You 'll be seeing a strong emphasis on pants of all widths and lengths , from classic trousers to jodhpurs , from slim , snug-fitting pants to palazzos . Complementing the pants are longer jackets , tunics and vests , " said Krug . <p> " " Then , it 's a " " must " to finish the look with a pair of platform shoes . They 've been " " in " for a year in New York and have found a home in the South . " <p> The Colors : " " Colors will lean toward blacks , browns and navy blues , as well as muted tones and neutrals . Expect texture in fabrics to play a big role . " <p> The Accessories : With an atmosphere that oozes history , art , style and fashion , one can expect a wide range of accessories at Mr. Goodbye 's , from the antique look of Subtle Creatures ' freshwater pearls to high-tech contemporary pieces . <p> The Prices : " " I really think people are not spending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want value for their money .

He found that there were no fit-and-flare jackets , tunics or velvets available at lowest price points , and not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I found was lots of great white shirts , and that in the city of Houston , people will follow trends but they like a lot of color . For spring , there was a lot of beige , buff and taupe , but our audiences here did n't know how to respond . That 's why I chose red as a key color for fall . " <p> The Accessories : " " At the budget level , there are a lot of pearls , especially with the romantic look , chokers , and earrings that are getting tamer . <p> " " Lots of hats , not serious hats but fun hats . But it 's important that women know how to wear them . A hat is not a picture frame . You can wear a hat when you walk into a room , then take it off if you want . " <p> The Prices : What Matuszewski found in his round of budget shopping were a lot of serious pieces that made for a fun look when put together . <p> Pictured is the velvet-trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120 for both pieces ) and a crisp , white cotton shirt with antique-look gold buttons ( $ 25 ) , both from JCPenney .

For example , a Giorgio Armani ensemble might run from $ 1,500 to $ 2,000 , but the same look could be achieved in the Et Vous or CK Calvin Klein lines for as low as $ 600 or in Emanuel or Ellen Tracy for $ 700 to $ 800 . <p> Pictured : Sylvia Hiesel maize jacket ( $ 925 ) and trousers ( $ 640 ) with a bead-trimmed scarf ( $ 200 ) and animal-printed suede shoes ( $ 225 ) . <p> HOPE BRICK <p> Vice president , creative fashion merchandising for Foley 's stores . <p> The Looks : " " An overall feminine attitude in dressing " is what Brick sees for fall , including wide , soft pants .

From the attics , " said Wilson , who has worked with Neiman 's in Houston since 1970 and is under the direction of New York-based Joan Kaner , senior VP and fashion director . <p> The Colors : " " Black is back , but most of us never knew it went away . Most women are looking for something else for day wear that 's not black all the time , a softer palette like the pale beiges of Calvin Klein and the European designers . " <p> The Accessories : " " Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's also a piece of clothing . Some are clean-cut and architectural like Montana 's , and some are soft and long with manchettes . " <p> " " Boots , booties and anything that has to do with a boot . There is lots of lacing , even up to the knee and over the knee . " <p> " " Of course , crosses - they 're everywhere . They 're not religious objects , however . It 's just a shape , a form . " <p> The Prices : " " Prices are pretty much the same as they 've been in recent years . It 's a separates world , so the illusion is that you 're spending less , however . But a woman can take one great jacket and change a lot of things .
