Section : Viewpoint <p> " The problem . . . is whether any of the chemicals we are using in our attempts to control nature play a direct or indirect role as causes of cancer . In terms of evidence gained from animal experiments we shall see that five or possibly six of the pesticides must definitely be rated as carcinogens . . . . Still other pesticides will be added as we include those whose action on living tissues or cells may be considered an indirect cause of malignancy . " <p> Rachel Carson , Silent Spring , 1962 , pg . 222 <p> <p> In a sense , the public can be forgiven for fearing pesticides . In the early days , when we knew less about cancer , we adopted ( out of fear and ignorance ) the most drastic test we could find . That was the high-dose rat test . <p> Then the high-dose rat tests " proved " that the pesticides caused cancer . <p> There is mounting scientific evidence , however , that high-dose rat tests tell scientists little about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact mislead the rest of us into fearing the wrong foods and the wrong dangers . <p> Rachel Carson was wrong in her belief that five or six pesticides then in use were causing cancer and that more would be proven carcinogenic . In fact , to date we have found one pesticide that caused cancer  --  lead arsenate  --  which was displaced by DDT and the other modern pesticides . Both lead and arsenic are carcinogenic . But we no longer use lead arsenate because of its broad , immediate , precancerous toxicity . <p> The high-dose rat tests find " cancer " in half of the chemicals tested ( natural and man-made ) . Few consumers realize that there are no pesticides approved for use in the United States today which are known causes of human cancer , or that it is unlikely that any human has ever developed cancer due to pesticide residues . <p> There are some approved chemicals on the " suspected " carcinogen list . They are mostly there , however , because the heavy skewing of the diet in the high-dose tests apparently causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) overstates the dietary risk of pesticide residues to humans by 10,000 fold . The EPA assumes all foods carry the maximum pesticide residues , even though only a small proportion carries any residues at all . <p> Hunger Before Cancer . Farm chemistry today means life itself for billions of people . All over the world , pesticides and fertilizers mean ample food , free from destruction by locusts , armyworms , witchweed , crabgrass , Johnson grass , aphids , stem rot , leafrollers , planthoppers , corn borers , dangerous natural toxins , and thousands of other pestilential plagues . Most countries would not be able to sustain life for their populations without farm chemicals . <p> What is the health trade-off for this abundance , produced with the help of chemicals ? There is none . In fact , there are health gains . For one , pesticides help prevent the grains and oilseeds we eat from becoming contaminated with bacteria or fungi that produce toxins and mycotoxins which can cause cancer . One fourth of the world 's cereals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much lower risks , because of pesticides . Even more importantly , pesticides permit us to provide an abundance of the low-cost , attractive fruits and vegetables that are humanity 's best defense against both cancer and heart disease . Eating five servings of fruits and vegetables per day cuts our cancer risks in half  --  whether they 're organic or not . <p> Zero Risk From Pesticides ? The activists demand that we prove zero human risk in pesticides  --  or ban them . <p> We can not , in fact , prove zero risk . But we can prove that the natural chemicals in our foods themselves are 10,000 times more toxic than pesticide residues . We know the foods are safe ; in fact they 're beneficial . So we know the pesticide risks are so low they 're almost nonexistent . ( In high-dose rat tests , pesticide residues have proven less dangerous than mustard and pickles . ) <p> The rapidly-lengthening life spans in countries that use farm chemicals are a strong indicator that we thrive on the foods containing both the natural and man-made " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes little sense to suggest that we would be living even longer without the pesticide residues  --  until after the activists have found ways to deal with the " rat risky " natural compounds which are 10,000 times more abundant in our diets . <p> Suppressing Toxins . The U.N . Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that up to 25% of the world 's food crops are contaminated with mycotoxins , many of which have the potential to harm people . A recent report from the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology examined the danger these toxins can represent and the ways in which Americans can avoid them . <p> Aflatoxin , for example , is a potent carcinogen found most often in moldy corn , peanuts , and cottonseed . In western India , about 100 people died in 1974 and ' 75 when 200 villages tried to subsist on heavily molded corn . In England , thousands of turkeys died  --  of acute liver failure in the 1960s when fed aflatoxin-contaminated peanut meal from Brazil . When dairy cattle are fed contaminated feed , aflatoxin can be transmitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yogurt . In humans it is associated with cancer of the liver and  --  in cases of severe exposure with gastrointestinal hemorrhage . <p> Avoiding and minimizing mycotoxins starts with controlling insect and rodent damage in the field . That 's because insect and rodent damage creates openings for the fungi which produce the mycotoxins . Pesticides are frontline defenses against these toxins . Even after harvest , however , the crops must be protected from storage pests . We have to build safe , dry storage  --  and sometimes we also have to use low-toxicity antifungal agents , such as propionic acid , or even fumigants . <p> Fighting Cancer and Heart Disease with Produce . Pesticides have been critically important in enabling us to produce ample supplies of attractive and reasonably-priced fruits and vegetables for year-round consumption . <p> Eating more fruits and vegetables , studies show , can cut cancer risk in half and markedly reduce the ratio of heart disease and immune dysfunction . Thus , anything that boosts fruit and vegetable consumption saves lives . <p> Dr. Anthony Miller is an epidemiologist at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Research Council 's comprehensive study , Diet and Health . He cites examples of findings to date : Carotene , found in carrots , broccoli , and many other orange and dark-green leafy vegetables , is converted in our bodies to retinols . The retinols suppress a whole range of cancers  --  skin , breast , bladder , esophagus , colon , pancreas , lung , and prostate . Vitamin C from citrus fruits and vegetables protects against stomach cancer . Stomach cancer was once our most prevalent cancer , but the rate of affliction has been cut by three-fourths over the last 40 years . Vitamin C inhibits a group of carcinogens called nitrosamines . People who eat cabbage once a week have only one-third the incidence of colon cancer as people who eat it less than once a month . Nitrate , associated with many vegetables , cuts the risk of lung cancer . Oral cancer risks are lower in people who eat lots of citrus fruits and in those who eat lots of dark yellow and cruciferous vegetables . Pancreatic cancer is lower in people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are only beginning to understand the protective benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption . For instance , two researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore recently isolated a single chemical  --  sulphoraphane  --  that has " remarkable tumor-fighting ability . " Present in most green and yellow vegetables , sulphoraphane encourages protective enzymes that work to prevent cancer . There is a strong likelihood that this is only one of several ( or many ) such compounds . <p> It is this pattern of protection from fruits and vegetable consumption which led the National Research Council to recommend that Americans double their current average consumption of fruits and vegetables . The National Institutes of Health , dietitians , and most other health professionals support that recommendation . ( Incidentally , there is no evidence yet that consuming chemically synthesized vitamins has the same protective impact . ) <p> Only about 9% of Americans currently eat the five servings of fruits and vegetables a day recommended for optimum health . This raises an interesting point : If only 9% of the people eat enough fruits and vegetables when they are relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough if they were twice as expensive and shabby-looking ? What , in sum , is the public health impact of activists frightening consumers about non-organic fruits and vegetables ? <p> How Much More Costly Without Pesticides ? A group of horticultural researchers associated with Texas A &M; University recently studied the impact of giving up pesticides for fruits and vegetable production in the United States . They compared the organic alternative with the costs , yields , and practices for commercial producers ( most of whom already use various forms of integrated pest management  --  both to limit pesticide use and make them more effective ) . <p> They concluded that yields for both fruits and vegetables would drop substantially without pesticides  --  forcing major increases in cost . Potato yields would drop " only " 50% . The yields of other vegetables would fall even more sharply , with sweet corn hit the hardest  --  a 78% reduction . Estimated losses in fruit yields ranged from oranges ( down 55% ) to apples ( nearly 100% losses in commercial orchards ) . Fresh-market fruits and vegetables would likely suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a number of famous fruit and vegetable sources would apparently be knocked out completely , including Maine potatoes , Georgia peaches , Washington and Michigan apples , and California grapes . They also believe we would lose the winter production of Florida 's tomatoes and sweet corn , making it difficult for the East Coast to keep up its cold-weather fruit and vegetable consumption . ( We might have to rely on imports , though there is not as yet any organic fruit and vegetable import trade . ) <p> The Texas A &M; group 's study is supported by an analysis of the impact of banning just soil fumigants , done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Economic Research Service ( ERS ) . ERS researchers estimated that the loss of soil fumigants would sharply reduce yields of potatoes and tomatoes , at a cost of perhaps $3 billion to consumers in the short term . ( Over time , new organic producers would presumably enter production , somewhat easing the price increases . ) <p> These estimates of commercial yield losses are hypothetical , but they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European countries found yields on organic fruits and vegetables averaged 20% to 40% less than commercially grown produce . <p> Equally important , the prices of organic fruits and vegetables are virtually always far higher than the prices of commercially grown fruits and vegetables . Prices for fruits and vegetables are notoriously volatile , but organic produce seems to be priced significantly higher than mainstream produce week in and year out . If it were not more expensive to grow organic produce , the markets would be flooded with organic items with these high price premiums . <p> Pesticides Are n't Even the Problem . For 30 years , Americans have worried about being poisoned by pesticide residues . Billions of dollars have been spent studying pesticide risks . Billions more have been spent on costly organic foods and in trying to find better " organic " pest controls . Yet we are still looking for the first human victim of pesticide residues . We have found , instead , that pesticide residues are not a significant health risk . <p> We have now conducted the high-dose rat tests  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals in our foods . It turns out that the same proportion of natural chemicals ( about half ) as man-made chemicals is " carcinogenic " in the high-dose rat tests . Natural chemicals are toxic at about the same range of levels as pesticides . ( Nature 's own aflatoxin is about as virulent a carcinogen as has been tested . ) The caffeic acid in apples and lettuce , the limonene in orange juice , and the hydrazines in mushrooms have all proven carcinogenic in the tests . <p> The safety of farm chemicals was convincingly demonstrated by Drs . Bruce Ames and Lois Gold at the University of California-Berkeley . They developed the cancer risk scale used around the world  --  appropriately named the Ames-Gold Scale . When they rat-tested both natural and man-made compounds at high dosage levels , they did n't find much difference in the cancer risks . <p> Ames notes that a " typical American eats about 1,500 mg per day of natural pesticides , which is 10,000 times more than the average daily consumption of synthetic pesticide residues . " This means we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pesticide residues as we do in the form of natural carcinogens in our food . Thus , the risk from pesticide residues on our foods is truly marginal . ( See " Another Perspective . . . Nature 's Way , " CR , August 1993 . ) <p> The low risk of pesticide residues is also endorsed by Dr. Robert Scheuplein , the senior cancer expert in the Food and Drug Administration 's Food Safety Center . He told the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1989 that while natural carcinogens may cause an estimated 38,000 of the nation 's 500,000 annual cancer deaths , the estimate of cancer deaths from pesticide residues is less than 40 . <p> More than ten years ago , Congress asked two of the world 's foremost cancer experts , Sir Richard Doll and Dr. Robert Peto of Oxford University , to evaluate U.S. environmental cancer risks . They studied American cancer deaths from 1933 to 1978 and concluded that 98%-99% of our cancer deaths are due to 1 ) smoking ; 2 ) our own genetics ; and 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fiber . Who believes the Doll and Peto results ? Virtually every regulatory body and medical association . Included are the American Institute of Food Technologists and 14 scientific societies representing over 100,000 microbiologists , toxicologists , veterinarians , and food scientists . <p> Doll and Peto wrote : " The occurrence of pesticides as dietary pollutants seems unimportant . There has been no increase in the incidence of liver tumors in developed countries since the long-lasting pesticides were introduced . Yet liver tumors are the most common form of cancer found in animal-based toxicological studies . " <p> If pesticide residues are highly toxic to humans , they should attack our stomachs as well as our livers . But stomach cancer rates in the countries with the highest rates of pesticide use have been dropping sharply throughout the pesticide era . Stomach cancer rates in the United States have dropped 75% since the 1930s . A similar declining stomach cancer trend is found in Japan and in Europe  --  which use farm chemicals even more heavily than the United States . <p> Credit for the declining trend in stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern chemically assisted farming ; both help reduce the molds , toxins , and other pests in the food we consume . <p> None of the nonsmoking cancer statistics has shown an increase in any of the countries where pesticides have become much more heavily used . In fact , there has been no increase in age-adjusted cancer rates  --  except for tobacco-related cancers . ( See " How Are Cancer Rates Changing ? " CR , April 1993 . ) The sole exception is male prostate cancer ; but the highest risk for prostate cancer in the world is among black Americans for reasons not currently known . <p> As the American Medical Association 's Council on Scientific Affairs reported in 1988 : " A large number of pesticidal compounds have shown evidence of genotoxicity or carcinogenicity in animal and in vitro screening tests , but no pesticides  --  except arsenic and vinyl chloride ( once used as an aerosol propellant )  --  definitely have been proved to be carcinogenic in man . . . . Epidemiologic studies offer only conjectural evidence at best that pesticides may be carcinogenic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions , the delayed effects of pesticides on human health have been difficult to detect . Perhaps the health risks are sufficiently small that they are below the power of epidemio-logic studies to detect . Yet it is possible that there are very few effects at all . " <p> Low Pesticide Residues in Food . If you still believe pesticide residues are a danger to your health , take comfort from the fact that they are present only in tiny amounts . Food surveys in the First World  --  where most of the pesticides are used  --  show consistently low levels of consumer exposure . The latest large-scale monitoring studies in Germany , Ireland , Italy , Sweden , Switzerland , the United Kingdom , and the United States examined about 50,000 samples . <p> Most of the samples had no residues at all . Only about 2% had residues above the maximum residue limit . Most of these " violations " were compounds not approved for that particular food item . These unauthorized residues were found more often in imported produce , but it is also true that pest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different set of pests on snow peas than Americans  --  and if American growers have n't asked for approval on a pesticide , it raises the red flag for the U.S. inspector . <p> In the United States , the FDA 's quarterly Total Diet studies cover more than 200 food items , table-ready and analyzed for more than 200 compounds with methods five to 10 times more sensitive than those used in regulatory monitoring . No pesticides were found at all on 65% of the domestically-produced food samples . Less than 1% had residues over the EPA tolerances , and less than 1% had residues for which there was no established tolerance for that particular commodity . On import sampling , the FDA found no pesticide residues on 66% of the foods , less than 1% over tolerance , and 3% with residues for which there was no tolerance on that commodity . Traces of some 50 compounds have been found each year  --  but only in the case of dieldrin has dietary intake exceeded 1% of the acceptable daily intake ( ADI ) . ( Dieldrin residues have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> EPA Overstates Cancer Risk . The FDA 's Total Diet Study also shows the EPA 's theoretical estimates overstate everybody 's pesticide exposure by a factor of 100 . The EPA , for whatever reason , assumes that all pesticides are used to the legal limit on every crop . They are n't . Not even close . <p> As noted , more than 60% of our foods have no chemical residues when ready for eating . That 's because farmers do n't spend cash for pesticides except where they 're needed and because many foods are washed , peeled , cooked , or otherwise modified after they leave the field . Without the " table ready " stipulation , any residues on an orange peel , for example , would be included in " consumption , " though we rarely eat the bitter orange peel . <p> According to a study by Dr. Sandra Archibald of the Stanford Food Research Institute and Dr. Carl Winter of the University of California-Riverside , the EPA risk assumptions on tomatoes overstate real risk by a factor of 2,600 , the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Overall , the impact of reality on EPA assumptions is to cut our cancer risks from a supposed one in 10,000 to as little as one in a million . <p> Scientists are questioning regulations governing such chemicals as dioxin , DDT , saccharin , and cyclamates , which have produced cancers in some lab animal tests but which experts believe are not harmful to humans at low doses . Officials with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , which directs animal toxicology studies for the federal government , estimate that between one-third and two-thirds of substances classed as carcinogenic because of high-dose tests in rodents would be benign in humans at normal exposures . <p> Finding the Real Causes of Cancer . Despite extensive research , modern pesticides have not been implicated in causing human cancer . Instead , researchers have been finding genetic causes for much of our nonsmoking cancer . <p> Recently , for example , researchers at Johns Hopkins and the University of Helsinki discovered a human gene that  --  when defective  --  apparently accounts for a high proportion of our colon cancers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and virtually all will develop colon cancer . Sporadic mutations of the same gene apparently also cause other types of cancer , including stomach , ovarian , and uterine cancer . <p> Researchers previously identified a large number of other genes , called oncogenes , that  --  when defective  --  play a role in initiating cancer . The newly discovered gene , called MSH2 , goes farther . It effectively creates other dangerous oncogenes by allowing random mutations to accumulate in cells . Eventually , these mutations can produce tumors . <p> The very process of aging may also play a major role in the onset of cancer , which is fundamentally a disease of old age . As Berkeley 's Ames and colleagues wrote in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences : " Oxidant by-products of normal ( human ) metabolism cause extensive damage to DNA , protein , and lipid . We argue that this damage ( the same as that produced by radiation ) is a major contributor of aging and to degenerative diseases of aging , such as cancer , cardiovascular disease , immune-system decline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage include ascorbate , tocopherol , and carotenoids . Dietary fruits and vegetables are the principal source of ascorbate and carotenoids and are one source of tocopherol . Low dietary intake of fruits and vegetables doubles the risk of most types of cancer as compared to high intake and also markedly increases the risk of heart disease and cataracts . Since only 9% of Americans eat the recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables per day , the opportunity for improving health by improving diet is great . " <p> If these top cancer experts are correct , cancer is the result of oxidation  --  part of the process of life . The damage caused by oxidation builds up in our cells , gradually impairing their functions . It 's almost as though we were exposing ourselves to continual small doses of atomic radiation . Our best defense is to consume antioxidents that help protect against the damage . Remember that we know eating more fruits and vegetables lowers cancer risks . We know that some particular compounds in fruits and vegetables inhibit cancer . This would explain why . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame to lay . No lawsuits will be filed against big , bad corporations . On the other hand , it 's not all that much fun to spend your life terrorized by cabbage . <p> For related articles , see " Why Chemical-Free Farming Wo n't Work , " CR , December 1993 , " Why Better Diet Means Better Health , " CR , June 1993 , " Do Pesticides Cause Cancer ?

He was formerly senior agricultural analyst for the U.S. Dept. of State . This article is adapted , with permission , from his new book , Saving the Planet with Pesticides and Plastic , published by Hudson Institute . <p> KIDS AND PESTICIDES <p> Early in 1993 , Bill Moyers hosted a " Front-line " program on PBS-TV titled " In Our Children 's Food . " The gist of the program was that farmers and the regulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food produced with the help of pesticides . The program implied that pesticide residues are a ticking time bomb for our kids . <p> Are children really at greater risk than adults from pesticides ? They may be more at risk because of their smaller body weights . If they are , the added risk is not more than a factor of three . <p> ( The Food and Drug Administration 's Total Diet Study  --  the most accurate assessment of real consumer pesticide exposure indicates that infants ' exposure to pesticides is roughly three times greater than that of adults ' . Of course , infancy does n't last long , and infants ' and children 's exposure to pesticides is already factored into the lifetime exposure estimates . ) <p> As the accompanying article indicates , the protection factors in our regulatory system add up well into the thousands . <p> Cancer rates in children have fallen by more than half during the pesticide era . Childhood cancer was always rare , but it has declined by 60% since 1950 . The American Cancer Society estimates there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importantly , factor in that children born today in the United States have a 20-year-longer life expectancy than previous generations of people  --  who certainly were not exposed to pesticide residues . <p> Move on to the reality that cancer is basically a degenerative disease of old age . Only a few rare types of cancer ( such as leukemia ) attack a significant number of children . Moreover , virtually no carcinogens can trigger cancer immediately . Virtually none of the risk estimates would show any mortality risk without building on 70 years of lifelong exposure . <p> Moral : If you want your kids to live long lives , teach them not to smoke  --  and to eat lots more fruits and vegetables , no matter what approved pesticides have been used to grow the produce . <p>
