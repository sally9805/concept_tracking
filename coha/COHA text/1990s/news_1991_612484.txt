<p> If writers were still compared with boxers , the way they were when Ernest Hemingway , Nelson Algren and Norman Mailer were in their primes , Frederick Busch would be a top middleweight contender . <p> Unfortunately , he 's not paid like any kind of contender , and neither are most authors , whose incomes are far lower than the public generally thinks . <p> In the highly mercenary world of contemporary publishing , dominated by such goliaths as Stephen King , Danielle Steel and Tom Clancy , Mr. Busch is known simply and prosaically as a " midlist " author . <p> What " midlist " means in economic terms , Mr. Busch says , is that the yearly earnings from each of his 15 works of fiction are below the poverty level . While critics praise him , he has never had a knockout best seller . And even though his income has steadily risen , he says , " It 's not possible for me to earn a living by writing books . " <p> Mr. Busch has plenty of company . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a survey of the guild 's 6,500 members indicates that most contracts amount to less than $ 20,000 , usually for books that require several years to complete . That puts their authors squarely on the publishers ' midlist , with books that sell about 10,000 copies . <p> A chief reason for the Authors Guild survey , Ms. Stephenson says , was to help dispel the " myth of the multimillion-dollar contract , " bestowed with great fanfare on such frontlist authors as Mr. King , Ms. Steel and Mr. Clancy , whose books sell in the hundreds of thousands . <p> Though there may be fewer than 25 writers who get $ 250,000 to $ 20 million contracts , she adds , " They get a tremendous amount of press , which causes the public to leap to the assumption that authors are well- heeled , just like doctors and lawyers . " Closer to reality , Ms. Stephenson says , is the contrary idea of the " poor starving author , " whose annual wages are less than a bricklayer 's . " And it 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom has fallen out for everybody but those on the high end . " <p> Best-selling historian Robert Massie ( " Nicholas and Alexandra " ) , spent the past two years commuting from his New York home to Washington , trying to persuade members of Congress who were revising tax laws that " not all authors were lazy and dishonest , living on the French Riviera and deducting things that had no relevance to their writing . " <p> Based on the guild 's survey , Mr. Massie says , " We extrapolated that their median income was $ 7,900 a year from writing . And that included the Stephen Kings on one end , so there were obviously a lot of writers on the other end who were making very little . " <p> In its Rambo-like pursuit of the blockbuster , the increasingly conglomeratized publishing industry resembles Hollywood , with its focus on the star system . <p> " In a tough economy , " explains David Gernert , editor in chief at Doubleday , " the perception is that consumers are more cautious . When they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clancy , Danielle Steel or Sidney Sheldon , rather than part with 20 bucks for that hardcover novel by a writer they 're not familiar with . " <p> Yet Mr. Gernert remains more optimistic than many publishing colleagues : " I certainly do n't think publishers are significantly less willing to support marginal writers than they were in Twain 's or Dickens 's time . " <p> Not so , says John Herman , editorial director at Ticknor &; Fields : " This is not a good time to be a midlist author . " <p> One of Mr. Herman 's more gratifying exceptions at Ticknor &; Fields is Mr. Busch , whose latest novel , " Closing Arguments , " about a lawyer trapped in a circle of deceit , turned into a breakout book . With almost 30,000 copies in print , " Closing Arguments " briefly broke out of the midlists and onto Publishers Weekly 's best-seller chart . <p> Nevertheless , the book still is n't the passport to the economic freedom Mr. Busch has sought since he published his first novel 20 years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the astronomical contracts awarded such writers as Ken Follett ( $ 12.3 million for two novels ) , Alexandra Ripley ( nearly $ 5 million for " Scarlett " ) , Jeffrey Archer ( reportedly $ 15 million to $ 20 million for three books ) , and Philip Roth ( $ 1.8 million for three books ) . <p> " I have to say , " Mr. Busch says , " that I 'm jealous , envious , mean , spiteful , malicious , all those things . I wonder : Why ca n't I have that ? " <p> Until he does , Mr. Busch , like many of his fellow authors , has had to find ways to supplement his income . For him and numerous others , the lifeline has come from academia . On a typical workday , Mr. Busch spends the morning at his home near Hamilton , N.Y. , writing fiction , then heads for his classrooms at Colgate University , where he is an English professor . <p> " I 've had two full-time jobs for 25 years now , writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sooner or later , I 'm afraid I 'm going to lose some energy , and energy is crucial to writers . " <p> Because she did n't have an advanced degree , Carol Anshaw , whose second novel , " Aquamarine , " will be published by Houghton Mifflin in February , did n't have the option of teaching at a university . <p> In the 15 years since her first novel , " They Do It All With Mirrors " ( published under the name Carol White ) , Ms. Anshaw has managed to make a living as a part-time writing teacher , journalist , author of 20 children 's books ( under various pseudonyms ) , and film and book critic . <p> " I always thought I 'd have to have another career or job , that fiction writing was something I 'd have to buy myself time to do , which has pretty much turned out to be the case , " she says . <p> Though " Aquamarine , " a fantasy about an Olympic swimmer , is getting a generous send-off from her publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could be the final payment if the book does n't sell well enough to earn back its advance and bring the author royalties . <p> Discussing the other troubles of writers , Mr. Massie says : " The advances for midlist authors and first novelists declined , while advances for celebrities and proven authors went into the stratosphere . " As examples , he cites Ms. Ripley and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf , who collected an estimated $ 5 million for rights to his ghost-written autobiography . <p> Mr. Massie 's own advances are estimated in the high six-figures . But he had to take a substantial pay cut for his latest history , " Dreadnought : Britain , Germany , and the Coming of the Great War " ( Random House ) . <p> Most of the responsibility for his shrunken paycheck goes not to his publisher , Mr. Massie says , but to the Book-of-the-Month Club , which gave him only half as much for " Dreadnought " as it did for his earlier " Peter the Great . " " The explanation was that the Book-of-the-Month Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malls and book chains . " <p> Even though Mr. Massie 's large advances do n't amortize well over the years it takes to write a book , his agent , Deborah Karl , says , " He 's one of the rare writers who can live on his earnings . And overall income for most writers is definitely not as high as it was three years ago . " <p> John Blades wrote this story for the Chicago Tribune .
