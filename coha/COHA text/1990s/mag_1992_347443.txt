THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMEthing uplifting about a free nation of more than 250 million people choosing their leader , and if the rest of the 1992 campaign had matched the face-off in St. Louis , Missouri , the spectacle would indeed have been inspirational . Although none of the candidates said anything particularly new or revealing ( aside from George Bush 's promise , if re-elected , to make former Secretary of State James Baker a domestic-policy czar ) , the debate transcended the flawed campaign ; it was more possible than ever before to get a sense of the contenders , a feel for what they believe , and insights into their underlying personalities . <P> As for its impact on the campaign , the first debate will probably reinforce rather than alter voters ' impressions . Ross Perot 's strong performance will change some minds . All but the most partisan were surely left to wonder what might have been had Perot stayed the course . Bush 's continuing attack on Bill Clinton 's character and patriotism may eventually drive up negative ratings for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the leader going into the debates will be the leader coming out  --  and that he will still lead on Nov. 3 . <P> Each candidate seemed to have a mental checklist of points he was determined to make , no matter the question or his rivals ' response ; each understood that many Americans would be paying attention for the first time , and that oldies for some would be goodies for most . The President , who often uses English as if it were his second language , was coherent , but almost listless . Rather than firmly sketch his plans for a second term , Bush made a plea for four more years that was almost plaintive . In 1988 Barbara Bush said , " I ca n't explain it , but yes , the camera shrinks him and makes him look small . " <P> Last Sunday the President 's own halting performance reinforced that impression . Bush was understandably best when dealing with foreign policy , but his repeated insistence that " it 's not all that gloomy ; we 're the United States " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans feel , and the fear of so many others that they will experience similar hardship . The cartoonist Herblock once drew Bush on the sidelines of the Central American wars waving a banner that said GO CONTRAS ! That the President felt it necessary to play cheerleader in St. Louis is likely attributable to his having run up against two unfortunate requirements : the need to avoid being too negative and the need to avoid appearing too desperate . In trying to do both , he seemed passive , too unemotional and far too casual , which might be fine if the nation were looking to continue the status quo , but it is not .
