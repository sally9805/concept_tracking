<p> " I believe the rights to property should be retained , " Joe Slovo said . " It would be absurd for us to move into a post-apartheid society trying to eliminate the private sector , foreign investment and so on . We know that they are n't charities and they need security , they need the feeling that what they 've got they 're going to keep . " <p> Joe Slovo is general secretary of the South African Communist Party and a member of the executive committee of the African National Congress . He is on a visit to New York and spoke with me about the current talks with the Government and about South Africa 's future . <p> " Private property is not an issue , " he said . " The question is whether we 'll have the capacity in a new constitution to take steps to redress the inherited economic imbalances due to racism . There must be a certain degree of state intervention , which does n't necessarily mean state ownership . <p> " For example , in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their homes and land . There 's no way we can move into the new period ignoring that racial injustice . " <p> How can you meet the white community 's desire for security , I asked , if the state takes land or other property without compensation ? <p> " I do n't believe it should take anything without compensation , " Mr. Slovo said , " I really do n't . The form of compensation will have to be worked out very carefully , so that there is n't an enormous flight of capital - the compensation remains within the country and is in a form which encourages reinvestment . But those things can be worked out . " <p> Mr. Slovo said he believed in the market system and in economic incentives . But he said the black workers of South Africa have to feel they have a stake in increasing productivity , " which is n't the case today . They have a feeling of complete alienation . " <p> When it came to land , he said , there would have to be some redistribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law from owning land in 87 percent of South Africa . But that has to be done while maintaining agricultural production , and some efficient large farms would remain undivided . <p> In a pamphlet published last winter , " Has Socialism Failed ? " Mr. Slovo said the one-party state was not a Marxist idea but a Soviet idea that failed . Was he against a one-party system in South Africa ? I asked . " Absolutely , " he said . " It 's a recipe for tyranny . " <p> He said there should be no issue between the A.N.C . and the Government over " political pluralism , language , culture , religion . We 've said over and over again that we 're quite prepared to have those freedoms irreversibly entrenched in a constitution subject to a justiciable Bill of Rights . " <p> For years in exile Mr. Slovo was chief of staff of the armed wing of the A.N.C. , Umkhonto We Sizwe . For that reason , and perhaps also because he is white , he was a particular hate figure for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely as an unyielding Communist . ) Now he is playing a leading role in the talks . I asked how he got along with the men on the Government side . <p> Government ministers , he said , occasionally try to depict him as a leader of a faction that disagrees with Nelson Mandela and does not really want peace . Just last Monday , he said , at a meeting with President de Klerk , " we reminded him " that the A.N.C . ' s decision to suspend the armed struggle " came as the result of a proposal I made . " <p> There is a " rather soured atmosphere " between the Government and the A.N.C . right now , he said , " a strain on the peace process . But I would not like to think , and I do n't think , that it 's reached a point of no return . Both sides know what 's at stake if these talks break down . " <p> President de Klerk feels in his mind that " there 's no way back " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not make the process irreversible . The number of whites opposed to change is growing , " and they 've got presence at every level that counts in the state apparatus : the army , the police force , the civil service . And they could still help to reverse the process . " <p> Mr. Slovo returned to South Africa last May after 27 years in exile . What differences did he find ? I asked . " You walk down the streets in Johannesburg , " he said , " the place I would n't say is owned by the blacks , but they walk around as if they 're about to own it . Which was n't the case when I left in 1963 . There was a hangdog , submissive , slightly fearful visage in those days - but no more . "
