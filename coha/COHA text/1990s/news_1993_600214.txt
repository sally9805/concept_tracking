<p> Dining out is one of the best things about taking a vacation , so USA TODAY 's Craig Wilson asked five food experts where they had the best meal ever while traveling internationally . It turns out their favorite places were as simple and out of the way as the food was spectacular . <p> Mimi Sheraton , incognito food critic . Author of Mimi Sheraton 's Favorite New York Restaurants ( Prentice Hall Press , $ 13 ) , former food critic for Conde Nast Traveler and The New York Times . - Where : Chez L'Ami Louis , 32 Rue Du Vert-Bois , 75003 , Paris . Third Arrondissement . " Still very , very tough to get in . " <p> - What to order : " It 's a small menu , so order everything . " Very meat and potatoes . No vegetables . You can get a salad if you want one , but that 's about it . They do n't like to cook fish and only serve scallops while in season . " Most fantastic foie gras I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the wood fire , and we usually share an order of snails . They 're spectacular , in a haze of garlic , parsley and butter . " Favorite dish : " incredible roast chicken golden , nut-brown definitive roasted chicken ; and in season , late spring , you can also order it with morels in cream . They put a copper pot full of morels and cream right on the table and you eat them right along with the chicken . Absolutely simple food . It 's perfect . . . They have baskets of exotic fruits , and almonds for dessert , but if you lived through all the rest the desserts are n't that important . " <p> - What makes the place special : " It 's a dump . It has n't been painted since 1926 , I 'm sure . It 's small . Dark red with a patina of garlic and grilling . All the cooking is done over oak , and the room is heated by an iron stove with the same wood used for cooking . Someone once said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - Cost : " It 's not cheap . Easily $ 100 per person , depending on how much you want to share and how much wine you drink . " <p> Jonell Nash , food editor , Essence magazine . - Where : Peppers , 31 Upper Waterloo Road , Kingston , Jamaica . <p> - What to order : Jamaican jerk chicken , pork or sausage . " They have jerk ( very succulent , peppery marinade ) that is just so wonderful . The best . It was my first experience eating authentic Jamaican jerk . I 'd had stateside versions of it , but this is the real thing . It was sensational . I was expecting it to come on a plate with a couple of side orders , but it was just jerk , served out of cardboard containers , I think . " Everybody on the island drinks the local Red Stripe beer . There 's also the coconut water , but it 's an acquired taste . " If you want side dishes , it 's peas and rice , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with almost every dinner . " <p> - What makes the place special : " It 's open air , and it 's owned by Jamaicans and it 's not geared toward tourists . That 's the best thing about it . I would describe it as an upscale in-spot for locals . Nothing fancy . Not even any tablecloths if I remember correctly . I think there were even plastic forks , if you got a fork at all . It 's that kind of place . " <p> - Cost : " Very affordable . Not much at all . Do n't worry . " Under $ 20 per person . <p> Douglas Rodriquez , chef at trend-setting YUCA restaurant , Coral Gables , Fla. - Where : El Olivo Restaurante , General Gallegos , 1 , c/v a Juan Ramon Jimenez , 28036 Madrid , Spain . <p> - What to order : Olive pesto with fresh baked bread . Spanish prosciutto served with cheese . Very plain . " The fish entrees were the most memorable . We had some salmon and this amazing squid dish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chef " just kept sending stuff out of the kitchen . It was like a giant taste test . Great selection of brandies at the end of the night on a rolling cart . <p> - What makes the place special : " The restaurant is nothing special , but the hospitality of the chef was incredible . He went from table to table . It was like a ' Come into my home ' type of thing . " <p> - Cost : " Very moderate by Spanish standards . Probably about $ 50 a person . " <p> Jeff Smith , author of The Frugal Gourmet 's Culinary Handbook ( William Morrow , $ 23 ) ; TV 's The Frugal Gourmet . - Where : Trattoria Vecchio Molinetto , Parma , Italy . " Down a dirt road , behind some trees , just outside of town . Everyone knows where it is . . . . Eat outside . " <p> - What to order : Agnolini ( large ravioli but made with very thin pasta ) huge pillows stuffed with veal and ricotta cheese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chicken twice cooked . ( The cook ) pan roasts chicken halves in rosemary butter and when it 's just about cooked through , she removes them , smashes them onto a hot steel griddle , and then she presses them until they have a rosemary butter crunchy skin . Caramelized . It 's just fabulous . " <p> - What makes the place special : " It 's an old joint run for 38 years by an old lady , Ermina Marasi . She runs a kitchen with an iron hand . She shoots the chefs who just drive by ! And the husband is a little man who never leaves the bar . It 's a great place . " <p> - Cost : " This place is not terribly expensive by Italian standards . You can have a nice meal for $ 70 per person , with wine , for four courses . You can get by cheaper , but what 's the point ? " <p> Amal Naj , author of Pepper : A Story of Hot Pursuits ( Knopf , $ 23 ) . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> - What to order : Start with " Panuchos Yucatecos , " tortillas filled with vinegar-flavored fried black beans and slivers of turkey that 's lightly seasoned with black pepper . Although picante salsas and sauces made with habanero , the world 's hottest pepper , are on the table , ask for a toasted habanero in fresh lime juice as an additional garnish . For drink , try Negra Leon , the local dark beer . Follow with a light soup ( sopa de lima or sopa de queso ) , and reserve a large appetite for the delicate venison ( from small deer that 's abundant in the region ) and pork . " My favorite is cochinita pibil , which is pig rubbed with achiote , sour orange juice and other spices , and wrapped in banana leaves and baked in a pit . " <p> - What makes the place special : It has the ambience of a bustling coffeehouse the restaurant is frequented mostly by the working class . " I had a meal that was extraordinary for the active experience it offered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in fine dining in the West dishes presented with architectural flourishes , on oversized plates , with broths and sauces colored and scented with licensed arrogance food has lost its connection with the world outside . " <p> - Cost : Less than $ 30 for two .
