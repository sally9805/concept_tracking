Sister Societies of PSA International Affairs Committee <p> The photographic organizations introduced here are mostly leading establishments of considerable prominence in their respective countries or nations . Their titles may include words such as " Society , " " Association " or simply " Club , " giving very little indication of their size , prestige , longevity , functions , purposes or activities . <p> The International Affairs Committee ( IAC ) , an active arm of the Photographic Society of America wishes to acquaint the world photographic arena with these organizations in an effort to improve the liaison , understanding and interaction of all photographers . These groups help to exchange ideas and facilitate available services , refining all aspects of photography . <p> Photographers , amateur or professional , may access the resources of these organizations for bettering their technique , skill , knowledge , joy , fellowship and friendship , through effectual communication . <p> The IAC from time to time will introduce other groups in the pages of the PSA Journal .

Tansiongkun , FPSA , 24 Hamilton Drive , Roslyn , NY 11576-3102 . The Australian Photographic Society <p> The Australian Photographic Society ( APS ) was formed in 1962 when the then largest state body in Australia , the " Federation of Camera Clubs , NSW , " felt the need for a national body to represent our country 's photographic interests . The problem we face in Australia is that , although our country is about 75 percent the size of the USA , most of the continent is harsh , arid sand and stony desert . The approximately 18 million people who inhabit our country live in sometimes small fertile areas around the coast . The exception to this is the island state of Tasmania which lies to the south of the continent and reminds one of the English countryside . Thus , our main obstacle is distance . While most of our major cities are quite large , even by American standards , there are relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open space in between . Any visitor to our country must be prepared to travel relatively vast distances . <p> The work of the Society is therefore done mainly by correspondence , which is often also not the quickest . Our post is best described as " snail mail . " We have circulating folios of both prints and slides to allow isolated members the chance of seeing and commenting on the work of others . We have , at the moment , four international exhibitions of some note and some 18 national exhibitions . <p> We have many natural history photographers of note . As most of our furred animals are nocturnal , our naturalists tend to specialize in birds and macro photography of insects which abound in many wilderness areas . Our landscapes , being harsh and forbidding , are not generally to the taste of international photographic judges , though they feature in our national exhibitions . With recent migration , our photography has also been enriched by the addition of many Chinese photographers , whose color prints are excellent . Creative/experimental and stereo photography also have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can belong to divisions , which specialize in slides , prints , nature , AV and creative . Our journal is known as Image and mainly filled with photographs , divisional news and a few very simple technical articles . <p> Each year the Society has an annual convention called APSCON , which is held in each of our states on a rotational basis . This convention lasts about a week with many lecturers and gives those attending a chance to renew friendships with people who live far from us . It is usually attended by some 250-300 members which is not bad considering the distances often involved and the fact that our total membership is about 1350 . Fabian K. Beal , APSA , FRPS , FAPS , ESFIAP Country Representative  --  Australia <p> The Photographic Society of China <p> The Photographic Society of China ( PSC ) was founded in 1925 in Shanghai , People 's Republic of China .

Chan Chi-Chuang <p> The Chinese Photographic Association of Hong Kong , Ltd . <p> was founded in 1958 . We now have over 1200 members . Some of our members belong to other photographic organizations in Hong Kong and elsewhere , so that they can promote the advance of photography more rapidly and effectively . Our association provides monthly print and slide contests , monthly bulletin and other programs and activities . Our bulletins have been entered in the PSA competitions and have won many awards .

PSA , FPSA <p> The Photographic Salon Exhibitors ' Association ( Hong Kong ) <p> The Photographic Salon Exhibitors ' Association of Hong Kong , founded 32 years ago , has been hosting international salons annually for the past 29 years . Based on its superior performance in those salons , PSA has granted them special recognition each year by designating a gold medal each for the best of show in monochrome and color prints in the Pictorial Print Division . <p> The main goals of the Association are : ( 1 ) to promote the art of photography through the hosting of international salons , ( 2 ) to help and encourage its members to participate in international salons , ( 3 ) to communicate with other camera clubs in order to exchange experiences and to update their knowledge of current trends in photography . <p> Many of its members are world renowned photographers .

At present , the Association is launching a special members ' exhibition , called the Passage of Photography , in Hong Kong December 59 , 1996 , to mark the 30th Anniversary of its salon activities . Selected prints of its members will be published in a hard cover photo album , with an estimated volume of about 400 pages . It is expected that this publication will expose the best work of the members , covering the period from 1952 to date . It will certainly serve as a record of the trends of international salon development over the past four decades in Hong Kong .

Sharma has , for many years , been a most vital force in the promotion , encouragement and development of photography in all of its varied aspects . Intertwined with this basic objective is the promotion of the rich Indian culture and heritage . <p> Mr. Sharma joined PSA in January 1961 , 35 years ago ! He has earned many photographic awards and honors . In 1995 he was honored by PSA with the Hon. PSA , which is the highest honor PSA can bestow . All of this was in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the promotion and advancement of the art and science of photography . <p> In 1983 he organized the India International Photographic Council ( IIPC ) and presently he is general secretary of the organization . The council is structured similarly to PSA . Their monthly journal , India Photography and Cinematography , contains how-to articles , photographic essays , and controversial " letters to the editor . " Many articles are contributed by PSAers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by appropriate narration . These slide sets are duplicated by Mr. Sharma and distributed to subsidiary photographic organizations throughout India . PSAers contribute their expertise at annual seminars sponsored by the council in various locations throughout India . <p> The IIPC sponsors competitions and bestows awards and honors to those who contribute to the promotion of Indian photography . The IIPC has about 4,000 members , which is impressive in light of the relatively brief period of its existence . <p> In 1995 , the IIPC conducted its 13th workshop and conference in Jodphur and Jaisalmer . About 300 photographers attended . Twelve " faculty " members ( the IIPC term for " speakers " ) presented programs . I presented " Portrait Photography " and conducted a workshop with setups and models . Marty Malgieri of Philadelphia presented " Six Steps to Better Photography . " Joseph Tan of Singapore was also on the " faculty "  --  all other faculty members were from India . Their subjects included video , fashion photography , tabletops , photojournalism , and Diazachrome . <p> The IIPC conference entertainment was colorful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulating these ungainly animals . Dancers performed traditional Indian dances . They wore their native dress , colorful blouses and long skirts ablaze in reds , blues , greens and other vibrant colors . The swirling skirts produced a beautiful , colorful blur as the colors seemed to blend into each other . <p> A mustache competition found the men proudly twirling their mustaches and pulling them out to their longest length as the judges carefully measured for the longest mustache . The winning contestant joyfully strode among the applauding audience to display this large symbol of manliness . <p> One evening we left by bus for Jaisalmer , a beautiful walled city in the desert , built as part of the silk route . We stayed at various hotels and saw scenes of camels slowly and uncaringly walking along sand dunes before we took the bus back to Jodhpur . <p> The conference afforded personal opportunities to meet enthusiastic photographers in an exotic country , to share experiences and photographic artistry and to see a land of color and glorious light .
