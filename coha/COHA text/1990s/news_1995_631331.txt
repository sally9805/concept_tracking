<p> Perhaps what you cherish about the holidays are the intangibles , especially the time you spend with your children . <p> Or maybe you 've learned in self-defense to include them in the preparations  --  the shopping , gift-wrapping , cleaning , decorating and other pre-celebration business . <p> Food is at the very heart of family tradition . So , if cooking is an act of giving , this season may be a good time to share that joy with your youngsters . <p> Teaching a child to cook teaches " how to serve himself and others , " said Marion Cunningham , whose long-awaited new book , Cooking With Children ( Alfred A. Knopf , $ 18 ) , was published last month . <p> Serving himself and others is what Adam Chernoff , 4 , does in the kitchen with his mother , Julie  --  especially serving himself . That 's understandable if you 're 4 , hungry and cook often with a mother who does n't draw boundaries around what a child does  --  and does n't  --  like to eat . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son made a holiday strudel with fillo dough , sliced apples and dried cranberries . <p> " The sugar makes it sweet and the cinnamon makes it spicy , " Chernoff explained to Adam as he nibbled on some fruit . Then together they sprinkled the mixture over the apples . <p> " Why ? " asked Adam ( a refrain heard often during the conversation ) . <p> " I try to cover the ' what ' and the ' why , ' " Chernoff said , " but what they retain , I do n't know . " <p> What they retain is taste , any observer can see . <p> Tasting became full-blown chowing down when she and Adam moved on to making Technicolor noodles , a much-loved family recipe created by Julie and based on an Asian recipe . It 's a way to introduce a variety of colorful vegetables to children ( Chernoff calls them " add-ins " ; that is , variables ) in her recipes , as well as an excuse to toss in plenty of baby corn , Adam 's favorite . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peanut butter and other ingredients for the sauce and toss them into the pot of cooked squiggly noodles and a riot of colorful sliced vegetables , there was more baby corn inside Adam than there was in the pasta . <p> No problem , said Chernoff . What she has in Adam is a helper and question-asker who will sit down to eat , with zest , a healthful , complex dish flavored with soy sauce , lime juice , peanut butter , cilantro and onions . Baby sister Leah , 22 months , is a pickier eater , though at this point she 's " the fruit queen , " Chernoff said . Leah watched the action as she ate some raisins . <p> Chernoff , who has an extensive food background as a recipe developer and former restaurant manager , now devotes her energies to catering and to culinary events for her family and kids . <p> From the time he could perch on a kitchen stool , Adam held measuring spoons and cups as his mother measured , hit the start button on the food processor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went along ( a challenge , admits his mother ) , and tasted , tasted , tasted . <p> Chernoff has taught cooking to Adam 's preschool class and at preteen cooking <p> classes at birthday parties , as well as family-oriented classes for adults . ( Ironically , her Evanston-based catering business is called Get Out of the Kitchen . ) <p> Many parents tell her that their children wo n't try new foods . <p> " I ask them if they eat with their children , " Chernoff said . Invariably , those parents whose kids are picky eaters do n't dine , much less cook , with their kids . " I tell them the most important thing is to eat with their children . " <p> Of course , Chernoff 's food is tasty and healthful . And if she knows her husband , Josh , will be home late , she makes dinner , sits down to eat with her children and sets aside a plate to microwave for him . She 'll sit with him , too , eating just a little more then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eating together " primarily brings people together at the table ( to ) exchange ( ideas and traditions ) . You learn . And you learn from people who care about you most . " <p> " An adult has a role to create traditions for a child , " agrees Joan Nathan , culinary historian and author of Jewish Cooking in America ( Alfred A. Knopf , $ 30 ) and The Children 's Jewish Holiday Kitchen , published this year by Schocken Books ( $ 18 ) . <p> Nathan takes the time to explain the historical and religious traditions of a holiday to her children , with whom she has cooked since they were toddlers . <p> There are bigger bonuses to the passing of the apron . " We 're raising kids to be passive in this culture , " she said . Cooking , she asserted , takes them away from television and computer culture . When Nathan 's mother-in-law visits on Friday nights ( the Jewish Sabbath ) , her intergenerational family cooks together and " she becomes alive . " <p> Nathan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she putters around , remaining " invisible . " <p> In the United States , cooking has been portrayed as such drudgery that the antidote has been cookbooks that glamorize it , Cunningham said . But cooking does n't have to entertain , nor should food become a toy . " It 's more than that . " Kids love to watch the alchemy unfold , they learn self-esteem and self-reliance and " it 's primal sharing , " she said . <p> And as parents prepare for the holidays , they may discover what Nathan , Chernoff and Cunningham have learned . Nathan put it this way : " If children are involved and do ( the cooking ) themselves , it 's more fun for me .

Having to work a full day and then head to law school at night , Manz shows up at the office wearing a suit and carrying a book bag . " I 've tried every which way to avoid it , " he says . " There is no other way to carry that many law books and a laptop to and from without doing it in a school bag . It looks ridiculous . " Manz 's dilemma captures the time-crunched lifestyle of the part-time law student . Weekdays after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of legal instruction . He reads case after case whenever he gets the time , which often sucks up his weekends . And he endures the occasional jab from colleagues ( " Where 's your lunchbox ? " ) when he straps on his backpack to do it all again . " The people I 've met at Fordham night school are such unbelievably high-energy people , " says Manz , 28 , who started law school while working in business but now works as a law clerk at Cravath , Swaine &; Moore . Part-time programs are available at scores of law schools across the country . Our rankings on Page 73 list 87 of them . Not all areas of the nation are equally well served , although if you live near Washington , D.C. , you 'll find no shortage ; five of the six top-ranked part-time law schools are within 40 miles of the U.S. Capitol . Typically , part-time programs are four years instead of three ; some give students the flexibility to switch into their full-time programs . What these schools have in common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These are people who are out there working and ca n't afford just to leave their jobs and go to full-time law school , " explains Andrew Cornblatt , dean of admissions for Georgetown University Law Center . Many choose this route for financial reasons ; others , like Manz , want to keep current with their industry . Another thing these programs have in common : They 're not easy . " You do n't fall into evening school , " says Fordham Law School Dean William Michael Treanor . " If you 're working and you 're going to law school at night , you really want this . " Part-time classes usually run Monday through Thursday evenings , often with Saturday and summer options for students who want to spread out their nighttime load . " We try to be very accommodating for the evening students , and so we try to schedule classes in such a way that they can go to class fairly easily and work full time , " says John Attanasio , dean of the Dedman School of Law at Southern Methodist University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fordham students interviewed for this article said they have less time for family and friends . But they also know the key to success : striking a balance between work , school , and -- because part-time law students are often older than their full-time law school peers -- family , too . The biggest drawback of part-time legal education is that students have less time than their full-time peers for extracurricular activities -- and fewer opportunities to gain practical experience before graduation . " It 's definitely more difficult for us to get legal experience in , though I think the expectation will be different for evening students , " says Susan M. Stern , an architect who is enrolled in Fordham 's evening division . " I think it 's important to have something to put on your rsum that is specifically legal , but I do n't think it needs to be a full-time gig , by any means . " Fordham offers several nighttime clinics to help students beef up their rsums . Schools with evening programs help with the burden by doing the little things -- keeping their administration offices open later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so students can socialize . Part-time programs attract students with a variety of educational and professional backgrounds , some of whom are pursuing law as a second , third , or even fourth career . And admissions decisions are based not just on grades and the LSAT but on professional experience , too . " It 's a really interesting , fun mix of students , " says Georgetown 's Cornblatt . " These are people with narratives , stories , real biographies . " Classes are also taught by a mix of tenured faculty and adjunct professors ; the adjuncts ' legal experience is often unique . For many who have taken on the daunting task of going to law school while working full time , it has been not only doable but enjoyable . And it 's not just the school but the students who make it possible . " I found in general we were very supportive of each other , " says Stern . " We all know we 're in the same boat and are very reliant on each other . " Fordham classmate Paul Marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares notes .
