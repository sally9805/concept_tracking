In broker arbitration , broker decide if broker broke the law Guess who usually winds up broke ? <p> Julia and Eugene McMahon never saw it coming . They were in a dark restaurant one evening with their " financial adviser " from Shearson/American Express , when she handed them a piece of paper to sign . " It 's just red tape to open a brokerage account , " the adviser told them . Even in the light of day , the McMahons would n't have read through the tiny print and understood the clause that was to win them a place in judicial history . They did n't know a lot of things that day . They did n't even guess that this nice woman who had befriended them in church would betray their trust and invest their retirement savings in dicey options trading , or that she would reap $200,000 in commissions as they lost $500,000 . <p> Nor did they know that the document they signed that day in New York robbed them of the fight to take their adviser to court . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to seek remedies in court , including the right to a jury trial , " is buried in a finely printed litany of boiler-plate lingo . As the McMahons ' lawyer , Theodore Eppenstein , noted dryly in a congressional hearing , when five congressmen could not find the clause in his clients ' agreement , " I 'll give you a hint . It 's not on the first page . " <p> Brokers prefer to gloss over the issue of disputes and forced arbitration when clients are preparing to trust them with their money . " We are told by investors that time and time again brokers advise them that the agreement does not have to be gone over with a fine-tooth comb , that it is just like opening a bank account , " says Eppenstein . How many customers would balk if they fully understood when they signed such agreements that their only recourse to any broker shenanigans  --  including fraud  --  is an arbitration panel run by the broker 's peers ? <p> Of course , when there are disputes , arbitration can be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not the way it is currently practiced in the brokerage business . Moreover , the Supreme Court , hoping to unclog the courts , has barred investors from seeking justice there . Although the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , which oversees brokerage firms , has recently proposed a number of reforms for securities arbitrations , these reforms do not go far enough . The deck is still stacked . Arbitration decisions are still mysterious and final . And for all its bravado , the SEC does not have the power to ensure that arbitrators are even following the law , and if they are n't , to undo their decisions . So much for investor protection . <p> Unfortunately , fraud is not a rarity in securities cases . All too often , the files of customers wiped out through options trading or margin accounts contain falsified documents . Forged signatures on margin agreements and wildly inflated net worth and income figures let brokers " chum and bum " in investments that are crazy for widows , orphans , and many other small investors . Take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 41 with a 14-year-old daughter when her husband died . His life insurance policy paid $50,000 . She turned over that money and the $10,000 equity in her house to Chris Hodges , a young Paine Webber broker in Tampa , Florida . The widow , a secretary , was impressed with Hodges 's M.B.A . and certified financial planner title . Besides , her sister knew him . <p> At first Hodges played it safe , investing her money in municipal bonds . Then he switched her account into over-the-counter stocks and finally to one stock , Syntech . His next move was to margin her investment to the hilt by borrowing against the stock she held to buy more . It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that no one of her modest means and in her precarious circumstances should invest in only one stock and never , ever , with borrowed money . <p> When the October 1987 crash came , the inevitable happened : the widow from Tennessee was wiped out , her life savings and her daughter 's college education both gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer who argued her case before an arbitration panel last July , the signature on the margin account was forged and the customer profile " X 'd " out . The broker , says Goldberg , had originally bought the stock for his own account , and when it started dropping in price dumped it into his clients ' accounts rather than take the hit himself . To dispose of it all , he had to margin the accounts . His supervisors at Paine Webber never said a word . " They were too busy playing with their seeing-eye dogs , " says Goldberg , a former assistant U.S. attorney , SEC enforcement attorney , and New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) assistant director , who has won two other cases against Paine Webber for Hodges 's misdeeds . " But the real fraud is that Paine Webber made her go through two years of arbitration after admitting they owed her the money . " <p> As things stand , arbitration is an investor 's only avenue for redress . The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that , whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brokerage account , it is a binding contract . Furthermore , the customer agreements stipulate that any disputes will be resolved by arbitrators who are members of the securities industry and chosen by the stock exchanges . Talk about getting snookered ! <p> Anyone not willing to play by those rules gets shut out of the market . " You can not open an account without agreeing to arbitrate , " said David Robbins , an attorney , arbitrator , and former New York special deputy attorney general . Rep. Edward J. Markey likens it to the following car transaction : " Imagine buying a car , having engine trouble , and then reading in your sales contract that you are forced to go to the Car Dealers Association of America to resolve your grievances . Imagine further your outrage when you discover you ca n't even own the car unless you agree to arbitrate your claim with the car dealers .... I know of no equivalent procedure where the forum itself is a self-regulatory organization of which one party to the dispute is a member . " <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since June 1987 , when the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to deprive investors of the chance to air their charges publicly in a courtroom before a jury . Behind the closed doors of arbitration hearings , as the customer agreements explicitly state , " the arbitrators ' award is generally more limited than and different from court proceedings . " <p> As it turns out , the chance of recovering even some of the loss is less than one in four . In NYSE arbitrations , customers win 50 percent of the time , but only half of those who win recover even some of their money . And forget punitive damages and legal fees . Arbitrators ' awards are all but impossible to appeal . The prospects for overturning an unfavorable award are equivalent to a " snowball 's chance in hell , " says Robbins . The Supremes ' bad record <p> When handing down the decision that locked brokerage clients out of the courts , Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , the author of the majority opinion , tried to reassure investors that they would get a fair shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitration process had underlined the law since the 1958 Wilko v. Swan decision , which held that an agreement to arbitrate a Securities Act claim could not be enforced . But that " is difficult to square with the assessment of arbitration that has prevailed since that time , " she wrote in the landmark McMahon v. Shearson decision , which overturned the Wilko case . It appears that the Court 's primary motivation for the decision was to reduce the caseload burdening the federal courts . Yet , in 1986  --  the last measurable year that investors had access to the courts  --  fewer than 2 percent of the approximately 250,000 civil cases filed in federal courts were securities-related . <p> Not everyone on the High Court felt so sanguine about abandoning the commitment " to protect investors from predatory behavior of securities industry personnel , " as Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote in ms dissenting opinion . Concern for investor protection had been the cornerstone of the securities laws so carefully crafted in the early 1930s to restore confidence in the stock market . Four of the nine justices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated the goals of those laws . While there have been improvements in the arbitration system , Justice Blackmun wrote , " The uniform opposition of investors to compelled arbitration and the overwhelming support of the securities industry for the process suggest that there must be some truth to the investors ' belief that the securities industry has an advantage in a forum under its own control . " <p> How , then , did the Court justify its dramatic about-face in McMahon ? It appears that the majority justices were swayed by a " friend of the court " brief filed by the Reagan-appointed SEC . That agency had done its own flip . Only four years earlier , the SEC had instituted rules requiring brokerage firms to clearly disclose to their customers that , despite any predispute arbitration language in their agreements , investors had the right to take their brokers to court for any violations of the federal securities laws , such as fraud . But in 1987 , over strenuous staff objections , the SEC suddenly reneged on its duty to see that investors are protected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing that arbitration was the best means for settling differences . It also assured the Court that it was fully in charge of overseeing the exchanges and could " insure " the fairness of industry-subsidized arbitrations . <p> Fairness is certainly not what M. K. " Pete " Peterson is finding in his ongoing two-year arbitration heating . " I do n't think my panel could fairly arbitrate a game of checkers , " says Peterson . Peterson claims his broker at Rauscher Pierce Refsnes , Inc. in Dallas ignored an explicit order from him three days in a row in September 1987 to cover certain puts ( options to sell stock at a fixed price within a specified time ) on his Sun Co. stock . When Peterson checked back several weeks later and discovered his order had not been carried out , he complained to the branch manager . He was still holding the options when the market crashed , causing him to lose $800,000 . <p> But his treatment by Rauscher Pierce pales in comparison to his treatment in his subsequent New York Stock Exchange arbitration . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on trial and the rapist goes free , " says Peterson . <p> On the first day , four of the five arbitrators , before even hearing the facts of the case , called Peterson a " speculator . " The chairman told Peterson , " I do n't like your personality . But I 'm not going to use that to judge you . " He interrupted Peterson 's expert witness , saying , " I do n't think we want to learn law . I am an engineer . I want to stay an engineer . " Reviewing the testimony of Peterson 's hearing , Robbins , a great advocate of arbitration , stated that such belligerence is out of line . He also said that the majority of the arbitrators had acted contrary to the code of the Arbitrator 's Manual . " What troubles me most about your arbitration , " wrote Robbins , " is the arbitrators ' apparent prejudgment of an important issue ( and voicing that prejudgment on the record ) and the manner in which the Chair is conducting the proceeding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NYSE has adopted a laissez-faire stance in the Peterson case that is symptomatic of all that 's wrong with securities arbitration . When two of the arbitrators voluntarily dropped out , the NYSE offered replacements . One , Peterson rejected outright . But the day of his next scheduled hearing , there was only a four-member panel and Peterson refused to continue . The NYSE said it would find a new arbitrator for the next day . <p> When Peterson arrived at his heating , he found the same arbitrator he had just rejected . " Obviously , they are trying to wear me out . They ' re hoping I 'll die or go crazy , " says the 71-year-old Peterson . But he vows , " I 'm going to fight this travesty to the bitter end if it kills me . Not just for myself but for all those poor retired people who have no one to speak for them . " Home court advantage <p> Since McMahon , investor rights advocates have focused on challenging the way investors are coerced into arbitration agreements and on attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Arbitration as a concept is phenomenal . But the way it is being administered now certainly has the earmarkings that it is biased , " says Harvey Bell , an arbitrator and former Arkansas state securities commissioner . Attorneys Robbins and Goldberg maintain that the pool of arbitrators used by the NYSE is in large part to blame for the pro-industry slant . " They can play with the best rules in the world , but if the umpires are crooked , it does n't matter , " says Goldberg . <p> Lawyers for brokerage houses say that industry representatives who understand the products and practices of Wall Street are essential to the arbitration process . But that is only half the story . There are plenty of educated people outside the brokerage industry who understand puts and calls . What the NYSE really is doing is slipping industry arbitrators into the mix as " public " representatives . Panels are composed of three or five arbitrators , with one or two members of the industry , respectively . But real life is different . Eppenstein recently filed a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although two were designated " public " arbitrators . Familiar with the NYSE 's arbitration practices , Eppenstein discovered that two had sat on nine arbitration panels in the past year and each had ruled in favor of the investor only once . The third , who was in the nonindustry category , was called a " financial consultant " and revealed that he had a relationship with Philadelphia Capital Advisors . The NYSE maintains that since the third arbitrator derived less than 20 percent of his income from his consulting activities , he does not qualify as an industry representative . <p> Picking the right arbitrators is crucial to the outcome of the case . Brokers know this well . They have been keeping their own tallies of how arbitrators vote for years . But because decisions were n't released by the exchanges until last year , it was extremely difficult for plaintiffs ' attorneys to obtain the same information . Many not experienced With arbitration still do n't know the ropes . <p> Renard Chrobak , a disabled worker from Arkansas , found himself in front of blatantly biased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones &; Co . Chrobak 's broker had rolled the dice and lost his $35,000 workman 's compensation from a factory accident that rendered him unemployable . In typical fashion , the three-member panel was composed of one industry representative and two public arbitrators . <p> One of the " public " arbitrators was Harvey Bell , the former Arkansas state securities commissioner , who believes he was put on the list of arbitrators in the mistaken belief that he was a former broker since he had once taken the broker-dealer exam . The other was the chairman of the panel , an attorney , who failed to disclose that 90 percent of his income , according to Bell , came from work he performed for brokerages . In discussions with Bell , the chairman " acknowledged that Mr. Chrobak would probably recover in a jury trial , but he was going to vote no award . " Bell was so shocked by the oven prejudice that he filed a rare , and controversial , dissenting opinion . Chrobak , he concluded , did not receive a fair and impartial heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes could render arbitration a more level playing field . Including on each panel a former judge or an attorney knowledgeable about the rules of evidence would ensure orderly proceedings . Also needed are procedures for making brokers deliver all relevant documents in their files under pain of forfeiting the judgment . But the brokerage community resists change . After all , there 's a lot at stake . That 's why the industry continues to pour out the bucks to finance a protective lobbying onslaught . <p> Critical for the brokerage business are the bottomline costs  --  legal , PR , and of course , financial  --  of highly public court battles . The simpler arbitration process keeps litigation costs at a fraction of what it would take to fight a lawsuit . And in a forum they control , brokers expect to fare better than they would at the hands of a jury or an independent forum such as the American Arbitration Association ( AAA ) . The brokerage industry is fighting the inclusion of the AAA as a possible arbitration choice for investors . " It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Goldberg . <p> The lobby appears stronger then ever . For instance , last year the Massachusetts government wrote rules forbidding brokers from refusing to do business with clients who would not agree to arbitrate . Sixteen other states were ready to follow that lead . The Securities Industry Association argued successfully that Massachusetts 's regulations conflicted with McMahon . And once again , the Supreme Court flashed its pro-arbitration bias , refusing to rule on the case and effectively freezing the states ' securities commissioners out of an important role in consumer protection . Stunned by the court 's anti-investor attitude , Barry Guthary , Massachusetts 's state securities chief , says , " The tenacity of the industry in this issue is overwhelming . " <p> Reps . Markey , John Dingell , and Rick Boucher attempted to rectify this situation with a bill in the last Congress but were forestalled by then-SEC chairman David Ruder , who called for a study of the issue due the day after Congress adjourned . The lawmakers say they intend to reintroduce the issue . Meanwhile , Dingell , chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SEC , has asked the General Accounting Office to prepare a report on how arbitration is conducted . <p> Perhaps most suspect is the SEC . In 1985 , the SEC declared a hands-off policy on arbitration . In response to a query by Dingell to look into a bizarre arbitration ruling , the SEC wrote : " The Commission has no authority to review a specific arbitration to assure either compliance with the procedural or accurate interpretations of underlying federal securities law or other claims by the arbitrators . " In 1987 the SEC assured the Supreme Court in the McMahon case that the arbitration process was " fair . " Six months after that , the SEC announced a flurry of detailed recommendations to improve the arbitration process . Only some of these were adopted , others were watered down , and none have any teeth . The entire exercise is a testament to the kind of window-dressing reforms that characterized Reagan 's Washington . They fell short of helping the little investor , other than making him feel he would be better off . But they succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wealth . <p> A key area targeted by the SEC was the arbitrator . " The absence of clear guidelines for qualifying public arbitrators ... and the inclusion in the pool of public arbitrators of persons with clear affiliations with the securities industry is a source of great concern , " said Richard Ketchum , the SEC 's Director of Market Regulation . <p> In the changes finally adopted a year ago by the National Association of Securities Dealers , the New York , American , and other stock exchanges , the pool of public arbitrators was purged of any member , spouse , lawyer , or accountant who worked on Wall Street . However , a former broker need have quit the business only three years earlier ( five at the NYSE ) in order to qualify as a public arbitrator . Thus , an inexperienced investor could easily end up with a panel consisting of one arbitrator who is currently working in the securities business and two others who retired from it in 1987 . <p> Despite the new screening and the availability of slightly more detailed biographies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The NYSE permits an investor to arbitrarily reject only one of the judges assigned to any panel . Any other challenges must be made on the grounds of conflict of interest , and even then the NYSE has been known to refuse to grant them . <p> A more subtle problem , say attorneys , is the growing cadre of professional arbitrators . Some arbitrators in the pool essentially make their living off the $250 per day arbitration fee . " If you 're an arbitrator and you do it for a living , who do you want to get a reputation for supporting ? The little guy who 'll come before you once in your lifetime or Shearson ? " asks Neal Brown , a Boston attorney . " The plaintiff is going to get a list of arbitrators and he does n't know them from Adam . You can bet your life that Shearson and the others know every person on that list . " According to Robbins , to get that same information , a plaintiff 's attorney preparing for an NYSE arbitration would waste dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kept , unindexed , only at the exchange . <p> Many of the exchanges ' lists of arbitrators are in dire need of an infusion of new blood . An energetic recruitment campaign with thorough training for all prospective arbitrator 's would substantially broaden the pool and produce arbitrators as informed as industry representatives but free of their allegiances . It is painfully obvious from Peterson 's case that the NYSE does not have a big enough pool of untainted arbitrators . <p> Much of the bad reputation of securities arbitration could be repaired by simply allowing all investors the option to go to the independent AAA  --  a proposal actually made by the SEC last spring but still not enacted . Biographies and backgrounds are more carefully screened by the AAA , say lawyers . More important , challenges to the slate of arbitrators designated for any case at the AAA are unlimited . In a recent arbitration case , for example , Theodore Eppenstein found only two arbitrators from a list of 30 that he considered acceptable . It took five months , but as Eppenstein says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're happy with is well worth the wait . " <p> At present , though , not everyone with a problem can take it before the AAA . Only customers whose agreements specifically include the AAA are guaranteed entry . Although Eppenstein pioneered a loophole in the contracts of customers at American Stock Exchange brokerages that permits them to go before the AAA 's arbitration panels , it is being challenged in several cowls . <p> Not surprisingly , the brokerage industry opposes the AAA as a choice for its customers . Investors seem to fare better at the AAA , winning about 60 percent of the time . Dean Witter spokesman Jim Flynn says , " ' We do n't find that it 's administered well . " But then , Dean Witter recently lost an embarrassing case before the AAA in Florida . <p> The Securities Industry Association ( SIA ) pays lip service to the notion of including the AAA in customer agreements . Says William Fitzpatrick , general counsel of the SIA , " It 's a question of perception . We get hammered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choice . " Yet the SIA 's true attitude is probably more accurately revealed in a letter to the SEC last June , in which it argued against offering the AAA option to its customers . " The industry wants to be able to have better control of the outcome of arbitration . It 's as simple as that , " said Robert Dyer , an attorney in Florida . In a rare defeat for the brokerage industry , the Trial Lawyers Association in Florida pushed through a new law effective in October making it mandatory for brokerage houses in that state to offer customer 's the option of an independent arbitration . Writing wrongs <p> A key reform on which the SEC . just plain buckled was the issue of providing wronged investors with the kind of written opinion they could expect from a court of law . Not even the AAA issues written opinions . " I think the fundamental problem with arbitration in terms of perception is that people do n't know the basis for the decision , " says Guthary , the Massachusetts state securities chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitration boards make available a summary of the legal issues , the outcome , and the amount of any awards . Still unanswered is how the arbitrators reach their decisions . <p> Such explanations seem fundamental in a system that allows virtually no grounds for appeal and in which an NYSE arbitrator 's training in the law consists of an evening seminar and a 44-page manual . " Arbitrators can make mistakes on the law . Even if they 're using the wrong law , it ca n't be appealed , " says Brown . Investors at the NYSE can obtain an opinion , if they request it in advance  --  another example of rigging the system in favor of the industry " People usually do n't request an opinion until after the case , " says Edward W. Morris Jr. , NYSE arbitration director . A request at that stage is easily turned down . Of course , a better solution would be to expand the right to appeal . <p> A quick look at the statistics shows the SEC 's improvements have n't had much of an impact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commentator newsletter , arbitrations award investors about 15 percent of the total claims , just as before the new rules . " They do n't seem to have shifted the scale at all , which may tell us the decision process has n't changed in the least , " says Ryder . One hopeful sign is that arbitrators are beginning to award punitive damages in the most egregious cases . Ryder says there were 11 such awards in the first three months of 1990 , compared to 10 for all of last year . <p> Still , it is doubtful that the flaws in securities arbitration will be eliminated as long as the brokers are in charge . If the American Stock Exchange and the NYSE were fired from the arbitration business and independent organizations such as the AAA put exclusively in charge , arbitration could become what the securities industry advertises fair , speedy , and far less costly than court trials . Investors would gladly opt for it in all but the largest cases . But given the octopus grip the securities industry has on its regulatory bodies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the courage to restore the investor 's bill of rights  --  to allow him to sue in court or select an arbitration forum of his choice and to have a means of appeal . Only then will small investors return confidently to the capital markets . <p> by Carolyn Friday <p> <p> Carolyn Friday is a correspondent in Newsweek 's Boston bureau . <p>
