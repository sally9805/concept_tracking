<p> Start cutting away at the salariesand the numbers of specialistsout there , or whatever healthcare system we have will cost too much <p> " Everyone told me it was the wrong thing to do , " recalls Dr. Jennifer Weyler , explaining her decision two years ago as a medical student to become a family doctor . " My teachers discouraged me ; administrators discouraged me . They told me I was too smart to go into primary care or that the job would n't be enough of a challenge . " And sure enough , Weyler , now a resident in family medicine at the University of Massachusetts School of Medicine , is frustrated  --  but not by her job , which she loves . " It frustrates me , " she explains , " to have to continually explain to people what a primary care practitioner is . " <p> It was only 50 years ago , after all , that no one had to be told what a family doctor was , mainly because that 's about all there was . Eighty-seven percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internists , pediatricians , and family doctors . Today that figure has dropped to 30 percent . <p> That might appear , at first glance , like good news : As researchers become more sophisticated about what causes diseases and how to treat them , we need physicians who can focus on complex subfields of medicine . As medical technology evolves from stethoscopes to x-rays to CAT scans , we need doctors who can make the most of high-tech advances . <p> But it 's also true that , despite the media 's obsession with heart-warming stories about ice-packed kidneys air-lifted across America , the vast majority of medical treatments require little more than a visit to a generalist , where a check up , a prescription , or some simple medical advice will do the trick . More than three-fourths of all symptoms for which people seek treatment , studies show , can be fully treated by primary care doctors . <p> Problem is , the vast majority of doctors , namely specialists , are n't trained  --  or willing  --  to provide this kind of all-important treatment . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurologist 's or radiologist 's office to get their specialized care , we are wasting , according to one recent study , hundreds of millions of dollars annually on unnecessary procedures and other services prescribed by test-happy specialists . At the same time , the quality of care is dropping as preventive care  --  which is underprescribed by many specialists  --  takes a back seat . Specialized tastes <p> While these problems have dogged our medical system for years , the real trauma of the primary care shortage is yet to come . Unless we act immediately to double the percentage of family doctors in America , any of the vaunted attempts to repair our system is doomed to fail . That 's because  --  as everyone from Hillary to the AARP has agreed  --  the keys to repairing health care are eliminating waste , creating better " management " of health care resources , and beefing up emphasis on preventive care through HMOs and cooperative systems . To do this , they say , the point people must be generalists who would handle most cases on their own and curb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have n't nearly enough generalists to make such a system work . One recent study showed that universal coverage would increase primary care office visits by 64 million a year  --  requiring 9,000 additional primary care doctors . And if the current rate of decline in medical school students interested in becoming primary care doctors continues , the percentage of generalists will drop from its current 30 percent to under 28 percent by 2010 . Instead of a more efficient system , we 'll end up with longer lines at emergency rooms , clinics , HMOs , and doctors ' offices . This is sure to undermine not only our health , but our faith in the system ( not to mention the Clinton administration ) . Regardless of which kind of health care system we end up with , failing to remedy the shortage of primary care doctors , and fast , will cost us enormous sums and may even serve to lower the quality of care Americans receive . The government , medical schools , and the entire medical community must act swiftly to undo the present morass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , that the number of gastroenterologists grew by more than 1,000 percent from 1965 to 1990 ; cardiologists by 900 percent ; neurologists by 325 percent ; and plastic surgeons by 300 percent . In the same period , the number of primary care physicians grew by just 66 percent . <p> Specialists , unlike primary care doctors , are prone to order costly , unneeded tests : A New England Medical Center 's Health Institute study in 1992 found that specialists order more tests , perform more procedures , and hospitalize patients more often than primary care doctors treating similar symptoms . Family practitioners are less likely to hospitalize patients than specialists treating patients who had similar levels of illness , according to a recent Journal of the American Medical Association report . A 1990 study estimated that a 50-50 mix of primary care doctors to specialists would produce a 39 percent reduction in total expenditures for physician services . " Primary care protects people from unwanted procedures , " explains Fitzhugh Mullan , an assistant U.S. surgeon general . " General practitioners look at risks and benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This medical mess has been a long time in the making . In the decades following World War II , the federal government  --  in an effort to apply the same crush-the-enemy spirit it adopted in defeating the Axis  --  began funnelling huge sums of money into basic medical research , increasing federal spending on research from about $45 million in 1940 to more than $16 billion in 1987 . This reflected the attitude that if we threw enough money at any specific problem ( as opposed to focussing on preventive or general medicine ) , such as heart disease or kidney failure , we 'd cure it . More specialized researchers , suddenly well funded , came through with more and more specialized procedures and equipment , which in turn fueled the need for specialized physicians . As a result , great gains have been made , but it 's also true that as medicine became Balkanized , primary care became health care 's unwanted sibling . <p> These days , while the federal government pours about $10 billion annually into biomedical research , primary care research receives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest research funding program  --  doles out $5.5 billion to residency programs in hospitals and medical schools , virtually all of it goes toward training and support of specialists . <p> This bias has , predictably , snowballed at many medical schools . Administrators soon realized that the more specialized programs they developed , and the more students and faculty concentrating in sub-areas , the more federal dollars they could pull in . Because medical schools rely on federal grants for more than 20 percent of their revenues , going after such funding has become a top priority . As the money has come in , bigger , more expensive buildings have been built , and more departments have been created , each with their own faculties , staffs , and bureaucracies . The name of the game has become not just medicine , but survival and prestige . As in any large bureaucracy , competition has grown fierce among each of the sub-specialities to recruit more students and faculty . <p> While medical students have been pawns in this game , it 's also true that just about every incentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your head buried deep in Gray 's Anatomy not to notice that the superstar faculty  --  those earning the largest salaries , running the biggest labs , giving the big-shot lectures  --  are specialists . Add to that the pressure placed on students by specialist faculty who no doubt want to perpetuate their own fields , and so push their brightest students to follow in their footsteps . For those students who do want to pursue family medicine , programs with big money and large commitments are rare . <p> All of which help explain why more than 30 percent of students entering medical school indicate a preference for primary care , but only about half of these end up choosing it . At Boston University 's medical school , for example , the number of medical graduates entering residencies in internal medicine or family practice fell by 20 percent from 1986 to 1992 . At Yale , which once had one of the larger contingents going for primary care medicine , just 31 percent of the grads went for residency in primary care last year . Nationwide , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do stick with it , there is  --  once they graduate  --  a relative lack of money and prestige . Primary care physicians earn , on average , 50 to 60 percent less than specialists . The median for , say , an anesthesiologist or surgeon is $200,000 . ( Family doctors are n't exactly in the poorhouse . Median income is $93,000 . ) Considering that most med school students find themselves $50,000 in the hole the day they graduate , it 's no wonder they feel they have little choice but to move into a high-paying sub-field . <p> While generalists ' salaries are at the low end of the medical scale , the jobs are , in many ways , the most challenging . The amount of material primary care students must master is 20 times greater than it was 50 years ago , and they are expected to know about more areas than specialists . Their patients are generally the most difficult to deal with , such as those with chronic or degenerative disorders . Moreover , Medicare provides no reimbursement for check ups , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And primary physicians have to deal with all of the insurance paperwork hassles for less money . Internal debt <p> For all the negatives , many primary care physicians say that the substance of the field is quite satisfying . That should come as no surprise considering the rewards it brings : developing long-term relationships with patients , the challenge of solving a range of problems , etc . Sculpting noses is also important , but it is not hard to understand why many specialists  --  despite the fact that they 're hauling in the big bucks  --  can lose interest in their jobs . <p> But the way the system now works , non-medical issues loom so large that they can not simply be put aside . " I entered internal medicine because I found it diverse , dynamic , a real challenge , " explained one young El Paso doctor who recently quit serving as an internist to specialize in nuclear medicine . " But it was costly , especially having four children . My loan repayment comes to a total of $144,000 . Plain and simple , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't exactly what I wanted , but since it offered a lucrative pathway , I took it . " <p> Thus , the key to ending the shortage is to eliminate many of the negatives that weigh down primary care . Reform could bring the ratio of generalists to specialists to 50-50 by focusing on change in two key areas : Eliminate medical school bias against primary care . <p> If this means using the heavy hand of government regulation , so be it . Since most medical schools , long aware of the primary care shortage , have done little to alter their curriculum to encourage students to move into primary care ( and instead have continued to lobby fiercely for federal specialization research funds ) , it 's time the federal government mandates that schools provide students with experiences in primary care , such as required clerkships in either family medicine or primary care in the third year . <p> Med schools will , no doubt , battle to retain control over their curriculums , but there is little question that exposing students to primary care medicine early on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools offer family medicine as a mandatory part of the curriculum , but those that do send more than twice the number of graduates into general practice than schools that do n't . <p> Just to make sure medical schools get the message loud and clear , the federal government can ensure this requirement sticks by using the leverage provided by the $5.5 billion Medicare doles out each year in medical training and research grants . Senator Jay Rockefeller , who has led the drive in Congress to increase the number of primary care doctors , recently unveiled a plan that would cut off government money from any medical teaching facility that does not train an equal number of primary care doctors and specialists . Increase compensation for primary care doctors and offer more loan forgiveness for those who agree to serve as generalists . <p> Both Rockefeller and the Clinton administration have been pushing to beef up funding for the National Health Service Corps , a program that offers scholarships to medical school students , physicians , assistants , and nurse practitioners who agree to practice in medically-underserved ( mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now only about 1,500 physicians in the program , down from more than 8,000 before it was cut back by Reagan and Bush . ) <p> But solving the crisis now will require even bolder steps . Here 's one immediately workable measure that would give young or even middle-aged doctors the incentive to transfer to general practice : forgive a portion of medical school debt for each year a physician remains in primary care practice . If a doctor at some point leaves primary care , the remaining debt would not be forgiven . For example , if a doctor had a debt of $75,000 , and $5,000 was forgiven for each year he practiced primary care , the entire loan would be forgiven after 15 years . If the physician decided to leave primary care after 10 years , he would owe the lender $25,000 . This of course would mean spending tens of millions of federal dollars , but it 's also true that this investment would , in a very short time , be repaid through savings in timely preventive care . More importantly , loan forgiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of internal medicine residents said that debt had influenced their training or career decisions . And the money that we 'd save from having fewer specialists could immediately help pay for universal coverage . <p> Solving the other half of the money problem  --  making primary care practice lucrative enough to allow it to compete with high-paying fields like surgery  --  will require both government and private sector action . The most obvious route is aggressively equalizing primary care salaries  --  it wo n't be enough to raise generalists ' salaries ; the specialists ' must come down . Some HMOs have taken tentative steps in that direction . In desperate need of family care doctors , they are now offering generalists bonuses and salaries double those of five years ago . ( One southwest HMO pays its GPs $100,000 more than it pays some of its specialists . ) <p> Medicare should follow this lead . Reimbursement rates for generalists are still relatively much lower than those for specialists . The government should not only raise reimbursement rates for check-ups and other primary care services , but offer payments for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cessation programs ( which , remarkably , are n't covered now ) . Because private insurers often follow Medicare in setting their payment rates , the ripple effect will spill over into the private sector . <p> Most important , however , is that whatever change does occur comes quickly , since the administration is closing in on health care reform . If we have any hope of reversing this trend within the next five years , steps should be on the agenda now . <p> by Christopher Georges <p> <p> Christopher Georges is a contributing editor of The Washington Monthly . <p>
