LITTLE MAN : MEYER LANSKY AND THE GANGSTER LIFE <P> by Robert Lacey <P> Little , Brown ; 547 pages ; $24.95 <P> The late criminal Meyer Lansky was an immigrant math whiz with a hunger for self-improvement . As a poor , dishonest kid on the streets of New York City , he quickly learned that if you ca n't beat the odds , change them . Using sound business principles , he laid the foundations of modern resort gambling . In his later years he hired tutors , was a regular at the Miami Beach Public Library and a member of the Book-of-the-Month Club . To his retired cronies he was an engaging cafeteria philosopher . His underworld associates found his ethical views sufficiently compatible to still trust him with their swag . <P> For nearly half a century , Lansky 's numbers were his bond . He was , says biographer Robert Lacey , the master of " the share-out , " the cash skimmed in the counting rooms of gambling casinos and delivered in tidy , untaxed bundles to silent partners . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends from bootlegging days on Manhattan 's Lower East Side . After the repeal of Prohibition , Lansky moved into organized gambling , where his pals continued to provide the muscle while he supplied the brains . <P> The inconspicuous role seems to have suited him just fine . A small man who dressed down and drove rented Chevies , Lansky was described by a former employee as practically invisible . In his business , no news was good news , which may account for the sketchiness of two previous biographies . <P> The public got an inkling of the Lansky legend from the character Hyman Roth in The Godfather , Part II . Anna Strasberg , widow of Lee Strasberg , who played Roth , recalled listening in on a phone conversation her husband received shortly after the movie opened in 1974 . " You did good , " said the caller , who did not give his name . " Now why could n't you have made me more sympathetic ? " <P> Little Man should answer that question . Based on new research and interviews with Lansky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold businessman , a survivor who exacts grudging admiration but little compassion . <P> The man that headline writers liked to call the Godfather 's Godfather does not live up to his unwanted press . Lacey concludes that Lansky 's contribution to American outlawry underwent the usual romanticizing . There is no evidence ; that he sat as some sort of chief comptroller of organized crime . Despite years of FBI investigation and surveillance , no serious charges were ever filed against him . Lansky put together casino deals and handled blood money without getting his hands too dirty . He was even a management consultant who could shape up an operation from the craps in the casino to the crepes that came out of the hotel kitchen . But estimates that he was worth $300 million are dismissed as " sheer fantasy . "
