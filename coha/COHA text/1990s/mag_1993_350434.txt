Quiet , please . The new generation of power in Detroit is at work . <P> When Alexander James Trotman was named chairman of the Ford Motor Co. in October , there was no flourish or fanfare , not even a prior announcement . He was handed the keys to one of the largest and most powerful corporate kingdoms on earth in a small , no-frills gathering at the company 's plant in Dearborn , Michigan , almost as an afterthought to the introduction of Ford 's new Mustang . At General Motors 11 months earlier , affable , unassuming Jack Smith landed just as unceremoniously in that company 's top job . Following the virulent boardroom coup that ousted his predecessor , chairman Robert Stempel , and most of his top executives , Smith ascended with no ritual at all , and settled down to business at the world 's largest industrial corporation so quietly that he has seldom been seen or heard from in public since . At Chrysler , Bob Eaton owed his job to another noisy boardroom battle to persuade Chrysler 's miracle worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the dust settled early last year , Eaton drove up alone at 7:30 a.m. to Chrysler 's factory gates in Highland Park , Michigan , in a new Grand Cherokee sports van , introduced himself to a plant guard and rolled through to work . Since then , Eaton has adopted Chrysler 's informal team structure as if it were his own , pushing it along with the enthusiasm of a jolly and bookish college preceptor . <P> Such a modest and self-effacing style has not always been characteristic of a town that is better known for the flash and brassiness of its bosses , with cuff links the size of silver dollars and stogies the length of private yachts . Although few people outside the industry know their names , the three men who have ascended to power at GM , Ford and Chrysler within the past year have been working hard to accomplish what many said Detroit could never do : reinvent itself and profitably build cars that can stand bumper to bumper with the best the Europeans and Japanese have to offer . After two decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Homeric scale , their success or failure is a legitimate test of the ability of American manufacturing to compete against the rest of the world . <P> A revolution in engineering , manufacturing and management has been proceeding in fits and starts since the mid-1980s at all three companies . Now it is finally starting to work . The evidence is found in a new generation of products : cars like Chrysler 's white-hot LH sedans and Ram pickups , Ford 's Taurus , Explorer and Lincoln Mark VIII , GM 's Cadillac STS , the new Chevy Camaro and the Honda- and Toyota-killer Saturn . <P> For a change , Detroit is having a good year and is enjoying it largely at the expense of the once indomitable Japanese competition . The Big Three 's sales have risen against Japanese automakers for the first time in a decade : U.S. cars posted sales increases of 10.7% , twice those of the Japanese carmakers . Fully 76% of Americans now say they are more likely to shop for an American car than they were five years ago , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
