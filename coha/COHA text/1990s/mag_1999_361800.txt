The African-American science majors eating lunch in a University of California Irvine dining hall are on the brink of brilliant careers . Aisha Kennedy , a chemistry major , has done ozone research with a Nobel-prizewinning professor . John Williams , a biology major , is off to Kenya this summer for a project on malaria transmission . And Brian McCurtis , a computer-science major with a summer job at Novell , is seeing years of hard work pay off . " I 'd say my biggest problem is sifting through the job offers , " he says . " There 's been no job hunting for me . " <P> It seems things have never been better for minorities on this picturesque campus 40 miles south of Los Angeles . Freshman enrollment in the past two years has jumped 45% for Hispanics , 47% for blacks , and Irvine is becoming known as a powerhouse for minority scientists-in-training . Many blacks and Hispanics say it 's a far more supportive place than other U.C. campuses with bigger names and better reputations . " We 're a hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major who chose Irvine over UCLA . " But a lot of people do n't realize it until they get here . " <P> If it all looks so good , why are some people saying that what is going on at U.C. Irvine is a disaster for minority education ? The problem is , the rising minority enrollment at Irvine is largely a result of California 's two-year-old ban on affirmative action at public colleges . As preferences were removed that had helped minorities qualify for the top U.C. campuses , notably Berkeley and UCLA , students who once would have gone there were redistributed down to such less selective campuses as Irvine . In California it is known as cascading , because minorities are sliding down from high-ranked schools to lower-ranked ones . <P> Supporters of Proposition 209 , California 's controversial 1996 ballot initiative ending racial preferences , say cascading is good : it means U.C. applicants are finally being judged on their abilities , not the color of their skin . Advocates go a step further , saying that it even benefits the minority students who end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are better off , the argument goes , when they attend colleges that match their academic level . <P> Those who disagree say cascading is just a nice way of saying minorities are being shut out of the best U.C. campuses . And it means that fewer minorities will graduate with the elite credentials that would help them become top doctors , lawyers and business leaders . " Some people do n't believe African-American and Mexican-American students deserve to be at these institutions , " says Ted Shaw , associate director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund . " That should be refuted . " <P> For now , this post-affirmative action world of cascading exists mainly in California and Texas , where the University of Texas , responding to a federal court order , has also stopped considering race in admissions . But other suits challenging racial preferences are under way elsewhere in the U.S. , notably at the University of Michigan . Other states are considering Prop . 209-style initiatives , among them Florida , where a drive is on to put an anti-affirmative action referendum on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact will it have on America 's college students ? The answer is unfolding in California , on campuses like Irvine .
