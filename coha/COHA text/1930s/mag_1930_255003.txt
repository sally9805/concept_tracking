Famed French musicians are few-the U. S. public knows the names of Conductor Pierre Monteux , Pianist Alfred Cortot and a few others . Of the 97 principals in the Metropolitan Opera Company , in recent years there has been but one French singer , Basso Lon Rothier . Last week Basso Rothier was joined by a compatriot-Tenor Antonin Trantoul , a native of Toulouse and War veteran whose singing has won high praise in Paris , Italy , South America . He sang Faust in the Metropolitan 's 200th performance of the Gounod opera . He was weak-voiced , uneven and unduly doddering as the aged philosopher . Transformed by Mephistopheles , stripped of his old-man 's robe and shorn of beard and matted wig , he revealed unromantic jowls above a figure sadly heavy for his 38 years . Thereupon he proceeded with an impersonation of the love-struck cavalier which , if well-routined , had little to distinguish it from a dozen others .
