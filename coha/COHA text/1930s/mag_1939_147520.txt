Of puerperal ( childbed ) fever caused by Streptococcus haemolyticus more than 3,000 U. S. women die every year . Although sulfanilamide has miraculously cured thousands of puerperal infections , physicians have long sought an equally sure preventive , for most survivors of this ravaging fever are left weakened for life , or mutilated by necessary operations . <P> Last week Professor Jacob Bernard Bernstine and Dr. George Willis Bland of Philadelphia 's Jefferson Medical College announced the development of just such a preventive . <P> Several years ago , with Dr. Ralph Edward Otten , Dr. Bernstine prepared a vaccine from germs found in the vaginal tract of puerperal fever victims . He tried the vaccine out on hundreds of mice , then on a large group of nonpregnant women , to make sure it was not dangerous . " Aside from an occasional complaint such as slight soreness at the site of injection , or mild malaise , " said the doctors , " no untoward reactions were observed . Several women volunteered the information that they . . . felt better following the vaccinations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random 228 volunteers , women attending Jefferson 's pre-natal clinic . Most of them had pregnancy complications , including anemia , tuberculosis , heart disease , venereal disease . Some of these complications , noted Drs . Bernstine and Bland , are " factors predisposing , either directly or indirectly , to puerperal infection . " <P> Each woman was given gradually increasing amounts of vaccine every four days , from five to 29 times . At delivery , not one woman came down with puerperal fever .
