IT WAS suggested in these pages a couple of years ago that the average American was behaving very sensibly during the depression in trying to have as good a time as possible as cheaply as possible , while the men of light and leading were finding a way out . That was during the vogue of miniature golf , a sport which has since fallen almost as low in public esteem as have the men of light and leading . But it is still good sense to have a good time if you can ; when a man whose income is going down while his taxes are going up announces that he is tired of work and has determined to devote himself to the pursuit of pleasure , there is nothing much you can say to him but " Try to find it . " The following remarks are an advertisement for the people who find it at what is inaccurately termed the bridge table . ( Contract dummy whist is not " contract bridge " any more than a man is the descendant of his great-uncle ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established . ) Like miniature golf and mall jongg in their several days , contract is a big business as well as a sport ; and a person engaged in the literature industry must feel a certain shame when he reflects that about the only branch of that industry which is at present enjoying any prosperity is the literature of bridge . One bridge book has sold two hundred thousand copies in the past eighteen months , and I suspect that among its half dozen closest competitors wouldbe two or three other bridge books . " Who gets the girl ? " used to be the ever-dependable theme of salable writing ; but in contemporary fiction almost anybody can get the girl , so perhaps it is not surprising that this once popular question has been supplanted by " Who gets the bid , and what does he do with it ? " All of this has been a godsend to the bookstores , and of course to the bridge experts as well . Their books sell when other books die unwanted on the counters ; they syndicate daily bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach bridge , and in a thousand towns over the country " pupil of Culbertson " gives the degree of prestige that " pupil of Leschetizky " did in days gone by . But while , no doubt , the experts all like bridge , and would play it for fun even if they never made any money out of it , it must bring them harassment as well as pleasure ; like any other big business men , they have their hours of worry about trade conditions , and when things are going well they wonder how long this will last . I am an average player ( at least I hope so ; some of my partners might challenge that claim ) , and what is here said applies to average players ? not to the experts or to the enthusiastic incompetents who are as much of an obstruction to the game as is a hay wagon to boulevard traffic . In our own estimation , we average players are the salt of the earth ; for we play the game well enough to have some understanding of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well that our love of the pastime can ever be contaminated by any sordid hope of gain . And there are a lot of us ; if contract is not the national game it is second only to golf , and certain tendencies of the times seem likely to make golf less popular from now on . In the larger cities it is a costly game ; you must belong to a country club , and in these days of wholesale resignations from country clubs people who have not resigned find that their membership costs about as much to support as a margin in stocks . A good many people took up golf in the boom days because it had a snob value ? to play it made you look like a member of the upper classes . But as the depression deepens , the upper classes are coming to look more and more like the lower classes ; even if a man is prosperous he is afraid to show it because everybody he met would try to borrow money . So the snob appeal is not worth much now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gloomy nature ; some of my friends go out to play it in the same spirit of self-abasement that drove their medieval ancestors to lash themselves with knotted whips . But a man who wants to discourage himself nowadays can do it at far less expense by reading the morning paper . None of these objections applies to contract . It requires no costly equipment ; you do not have to go out in the country to play it ; you are playing against other people , not against some theoretical standard of perfection , so if you stay in your own class you will suffer no more than an occasional moderate and salutary humiliation . This , I am convinced , is the first and great commandment for those who want to enjoy contract ? stay in your own class . It will spare you mental anguish and it will save you money . To say that you can not enjoy a bridge game unless there is money on it is about as reasonable as saying that you can not get interested in a woman unless she has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman you will need no such irrelevant and supererogatory stimulation ; and if you really like the game you will play it as well as you can , whether there is any money up or not . Contract without a stake can be just as good as if you were playing for a dollar a point . However , there are people who feel otherwise ? so many of them that if you refuse to play for money you will be considerably restricted in your opportunities to play at all . But stay in your own class and you will find that ? since the law of averages can be counted on to give you a fairly even break in the cards from one year 's end to another ? your game will just about pay its way . Contract has further attractions for the reflective . Plato held that smell was the purest of the sensual pleasures because it involved no appeasement of pre-existent pain . The joys of the table derive some of their keenness from the preceding pangs of hunger ; but no man ever feels himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring up suddenly and present themselves in full force to a man who was not previously conscious of any suffering ; and when they have vanished they leave no pain behind . " Accordingly they are a hundred per cent net profit , and so are the pleasures of contract . The bridge player does not say , " When shall I awake ? I will seek it yet again . " He may be keenly aware of his lack of love or lack of money , but he does not grow jittery because there is no card game going on . He gives himself over to other preoccupations ; and when somebody whispers to him , " Will you make a fourth ? " the pleasures of the card table spring up suddenly and present themselves in full force to a man who was not previously conscious of any suffering . Another merit of the game : as Lord Melbourne might have said , there is no damned nonsense of utility about it . You can not pretend that it is a form of Service ; golfers who are too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will discourse at length upon its hygienic , cultural , and social benefits ; but dealing the cards is no great exercise , and the bridge table is no place to meet your customers and talk business while you play . ( Unless , of course , you enjoy conversational bridge ; in which case you had better stop reading this article , and may consider yourself conspued by its author . ) There is no good excuse for playing contract except the pleasure you get out of it . Some attempt has been made to give the game an intellectual snob value ; Mr. Culbertson 's Bridge World , for instance , bursts into the following rhapsody : " If bridge makes strange bedfellows , it is because the pleasures of the intellect are considered superior . Our common meeting ground is the play of intellect in its purest symbolic form . " But this is hooey , and a man so shrewd as Culbertson must know it . To him and experts of his class the game does indeed present recondite **25;1107;TOOLONG beauties for the contemplation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp of the average player as are the high joys of Jeans or Einstein . To play good bridge calls for intellect , but a specialized type of intellect adapted to playing bridge ; it is no more a sign of the general brain power flatteringly imputed by the above quotation than is skill at chess . Napoleon was a notably bad chess player ; which is a reflection on chess , not a reflection on Napoleon . If bridge brains were good for anything but bridge , you might expect this nation to he ruled by its tournament stars ; but except for Mr. Vanderbilt , who sails yachts , I can not recall that any of them has been conspicuously successful at anything but bridge . Another expert , Mr. Shepard Barclay , is less flattering to his public but more encouraging : " Bridge is not half so hard to learn as some people fear . Maybe not , but it is a good deal harder to learn than some other people realize . The experts , no doubt , would like to have it both ways : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet anybody who buys the right book and applies himself to the right system can learn to play well ? a new mode of purveying exclusiveness to the masses . It is true that you can not play good bridge without a bridge education any more than you can practice good law without a legal education ; but mere reading of books and attendance at lectures can no more make a firstrate bridge player than it can make an Untermyer or a Darrow . I believe that anybody of moderate intelligence can by diligent application become a sound bidder ; but unless some card sense is born in you , you will never be a really good player , even after twenty-five years of practice . Crede experto . The mere existence of contract , and of its predecessors bridge and auction , is proof of this . They are all variants of whist , and they successively supplanted it in favor because they are easier than whist . Any good whist player will be a good contract player when he has mastered the elements of bidding ; but millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands well and play them well ( after the bidding has located most of the key cards ) would be quite beyond their depth at whist , where the trump depends on chance and the location of the cards has to be inferred from the play . Whist was so popular iu the eighteenth century that ( as the learned R. F. Foster records ) at Florence whist tables were put in the opera-house boxes , and the music was valued chiefly as " increasing the joy of good fortune , and soothing the affliction of bad . " But a game that makes such rigorous demands on the intelligence ? or on the card sense , if you prefer ? was soon undergoing modifications to make it easier for the average player ; at least one of these , Boston , seems to have sprung up no more than twenty-five years after whist had become standardized . In Boston the essential principle of auction was already present ; it is a little hard to understand why bridge , with its regression to a very elementary form of bidding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin ( I believe the Greeks also have a claim on it ) its vogue is still less explicable ; the game of vint , mentioned in Russian novels long before bridge was played in the West , is considerably more advanced ; essentially it is auction without a dummy , and its scoring is in some respects an anticipation of contract . However , bridge swept the world around the turn of the century , while vint never got outside of Russia ; and millions of persons who had been dubbing along at whist found the new game easier and consequently more attractive . It gave an opportunity to cash in on your good hands ( when you were the dealer ) and escape without loss on your bad hands by bidding the low spade which in those days was never played . Your opponents could do the same , of course ; there was more purpose in it than in whist , less chance and less demand on the intelligence . The addition of the " royal spade " bid rid the game of its one obvious weakness and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Foster , that inexhaustible fount of card history , says that auction was invented about 1903 by three members of the Indian civil service at a lonely hill station ( readers of Kipling will infer that their fourth had been carried off by cholera ) who thought of it only as a three-handed game . But the auction principle had long been familiar in Boston and Five Hundred ; maybe one of the three recalled these pastimes , or maybe they learned vint from a Russian spy who had come down over the Pamirs . At any rate , when their three-handed game was played by four hands it was so much of an improvement over bridge that it needed only to be heard of to be adopted everywhere . And then , a few years later , came contract , which is to auction as Clos de Vougeot to the contents of the keg which you permit to ferment in your cellar . As a purely intellectual exercise the play in contract is far inferior to that in whist ; you know too much before the first card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of quite another order which is almost as good a discipline in applied psychology as poker . If contract has surpassed the vogue of auction , bringing new recruits to the card table and rekindling the enthusiasm of some of us who had begun to find auction something of a bore , it is because it is a better game , with far more action and far more suspense . In auction a good hand is irresistible ; in contract it may be only an enticement to disaster unless you bid it right . No doubt the mere change in scoring has impressed some people with the conviction that contract is more of a game . Writing before the present contract scoring had altogether supplanted the auction values , Foster observed that the stake per point was reduced as the score was inPUREST OF PLEASURES : CONTRACT e91 creased ; " why it would not be just as simple to advance the stakes and keep to the already well-established values is not explained . " Here speaks the austere aristocrat ; the more practical Barclay provides the explanation . The higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults who are wise enough to avoid growing up completely . " However wise such avoidance may be , plenty of adults have managed it with great success ; they feel that they are in fast company when they play a game at which you can go down a couple of thousand points on a single hand . Perhaps contract has certain other advantages peculiarly adapted to these times . Its values , and its interest , are detached , abstracted from reality , from all the heterogeneous and too often unpleasant phenomena of everyday living . I know of no mental exercise which gives so complete an escape from the things you want to escape from . Yet some of its principles have a timely application ; in auction you might bid a little and win a great deal , as you could in the empire-building America of the nineteenth century ; but in contract you must bid and work for everything you get and risk a disastrous penalty for miscalculation , as entrepreneurs are likely to do in the frontierless and more static America of the future . Vulnerability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more a mistake will cost you ? is a concept easily grasped by the American public , which has so often seen the career of a distinguished man ruined by a private peccadillo which would be overlooked in a person of less prominence . ( It could be wished that more of our distinguished men might be ruined by their public peccadillos , by their behavior in office . ) And finally in an age of confusion and multiplicity , of an all too visible increase in what the physicists call the randomelement in the universe , there is a nostalgic charm about a game in which for a little while you devote yourself to a fixed and precise objective . But all this may be fanciful . The great indubitable reason for the popularity of contract is its merit ; more than any other card game it approaches the ideal balance between chance and skill . And the secondary and corollary reason is that more talent has been devoted to exploiting it professionally than was ever before expended on any card game . In this connection it is impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts may have good reasons for disliking Culbertson , but they are all in debt to him , as every manager of a fight club anywhere is in debt to the late Tex Rickard ; Culbertson 's genius for ballyhoo did more than anything else to make contract a major sport and a big business . In the Culbertson odyssey fact and legend may be intertwined , but the story that he once taught psychology seems plausible enough ; for he has practiced it with a brilliance hardly surpassed by Calvin Coolidge or E. L. Bernays . This talent would have made him successful in almost any line of business ; that the accident of his marrying a bridge teacher made him apply his gifts to bridge was undoubtedly a piece of luck for the industry . His competitors might not agree with that ; but Culbertson 's unpopularity in the trade is part of his showmanship . A man who frankly admits that he is the greatest egotist on earth and then goes on flaunting his ego in the face of his rivals and the public knows exactly what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likable in private , built up a public personality that roused the hatred of the crowd , and it made him a rich man ; people who knew only his fighting face and his professional manner cheerfully paid fifty dollars in the tenuous hope of seeing him flattened out by a Frenchman or an Argentino . Culbertson modest and self-effacing would be only one of the crowd ; Culbertson challenging and blatant infuriates his rivals ; they trumpet their demand that Culbertson be abolished ? and the public sees that it is the pack against Culbertson and concludes that this one man is the equal of them all . And if there are plain citizens ? not competing experts ? whom Culbertson infuriates , why , that is more meat for Culbertson ; he gets their money too . The latest list of his publications includes five of his own books , one by his wife , and three by other writers explaining the Culbertson system for players good , bad , or indifferent ; along with two other books which seem , from the advertiser 's description , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like him or hate him , he will sell you a book to suit your taste . Such a combination of high impartiality and a nose for profit can hardly be found elsewhere ; it is as if the works of Karl Marx were published , in the hope of gain , by the Republican National Committee . Other bridge writers , plain blunt men , say what they have to say in plain blunt words ; but Culbertson goes into flights of metaphor ? the submerged reefs of distribution , the protection of the trump fortress , war tactics in open and mountainous country , etc . This may be quite genuine , the way the game appears to Culbertson 's restless mind ; at any rate it is good business . Read the other experts and you read about a game of cards ; read Culbertson and you feel that you are involved in an enterprise of major importance . Even the famous and ridiculous **32;1134;TOOLONG with Lenz was good publicity . " Let them hate me , " said Domitian , so long as they fear me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let them laugh at me so long as they talk about me . " The astounding blunders in play which distinguished the first night of that contest may have been due to the well-advertised plethora of champagne ; but had play continued on later and presumably drier evenings , and I suspect that some of it was deliberate ? a studied encouragement of the ordinary dub player , who will feel better when he sees those great geniuses Lenz and Culbertson gumming up good hands , even as you and I. Praise of Culbertsons unique gift for publicity implies no lack of respect for the solider if less showy merits of his rivals . For some of their systems I have little use ; but I surmise that if the leaders of politics and industry had bestowed on their trade , in the past three years , the amount of serious study and tolerably disinterested thinking that has been invested in bridge by the leaders of the bridge business , this country might be somewhat better off . Iv But room must be made for the objections of the advocatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge dislike it with a quite inexplicable frenzy . They will tell you that it saps the brain power , if any , of the individual , and disrupts the household by its contentions ; it sows discord between wife and husband , between friend and friend ; it is nothing less than the terminator of delights and the separator of companions . Well , most of the complaints about bridge boil down to this , that it is sometimes played by the wrong people . Too much liquor brings out your true nature , whatever that may be ; and so does a had bid , a disastrous takeout , a stupid play by your partner . People who crack under such a strain would crack under whatever strain might be imposed upon them , and I do not see that bridge can be blamed for it . The persons who feel it necessary to eon-elude each hand with a magisterial correction of their partners ( and perhaps their opponents as well ) have no place at the bridge table , or anywhere else where they might come into contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are more frequently found or more offensively conspicuous at the card table than in some other departments of life . " Never reproach your partner , " says Culbertson , " if there be the slightest thing for which you can reproach yourself . " ( On the other hand , do not reproach yourself if you think it would give undue encouragement to your partner 's baser instincts . ) This is not only Christian charity but good sense ; the practical attitude toward your partner , Culbertson pursues , should be that of a " philosophical , sincere , and sympathetic friend . " You share earth other 's joys , each other 's burdens bear ; and often for each other flows the sympathizing tear . " Partner , however weak , must feel that you sincerely respect his intelligence and efforts . " And if this is odious pretense , if he is so weak that nobody could sincerely respect him ? why , that is your fault for not choosing your company . First and foremost , stay in your own class . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social evening and find yourself in an unforeseen bridge game ? No ; but there is no law requiring a man who can play bridge to play it whenever he is invited . If you play with people you never met before you can not complain when your partner continually talks over her shoulder to people across the room about her latest roundthe-world cruise , meanwhile missing a couple of finesses and overlooking a discard or two . Of course , if you tell the hostess you do n't play , and some other guest pipes up with " But you do ; I 've played with your ? why , then you are trapped , and may as well resign yourself to whatever fortune fate sends you . But that is no peculiar fault of bridge ; it may happen just as well to a man who pretends he does n't dance because he is alarmed by the weight of his prospective partners . Social life can be made tolerable only by taking a firm stand on such matters ; and if indignant hostesses resolve that they will never invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read a book . ( In these times , it will probably be a bridge book . ) As for domestic discord , bridge never broke up a home that was not ripe for disruption anyway . If your wife is a very much better player than you , or a very much worse player , you had better not play with her ; but you had better not play with anybody else who is very much better or very much worse . In the famous case of the Kansas City woman who shot her husband for failing to make his contract of four spades , the news reports omitted the essential points ? what cards deceased had held and how he played them . But I suspect that if cards had never been invented she would have shot him over something else . Playing against a married couple 1 knew but slightly , I was shocked by their recriminations ; and when I was dummy I suggested to the proprietor of the restaurant where we were playing that maybe the game had better be broken off before shots were fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them two , " he assured me . " They love each other like you do n't see it any more . " Evidently their emotional margin was so wide that they could do without philosophical and sympathetic friendship . As to the vexed question of bisexual bridge in general , I think that men who say they do n't like to play with women are putting the argument on a wrong basis . The point is that you get full value out of a bridge game only when it is a bridge game and nothing else ; to play it well requires concentration , and if you are not going to try to play it well there is no point in playing at all . It is probably true that women , more often than men , regard a game of bridge as only an excuse for conversation ? including some women who can play an excellent game when they choose to concentrate on it . But once again , pick your company and you will have no complaint ; there are plenty of women who at the bridge table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather indulge in conversation over a few drinks . Call it the inveterate prejudice of a pre-war feminist , if you like , but I have little patience with the men who complain that " women " do this and that . Even Foster falls into this ; " women , " he says , " are great offenders in trifling matters , such as asking the dealer if she passed it , when nothing has been said ; looking over the adversaries ' hands as dummy , and then pushing dummy 's cards forward as if arranging them , but in reality indicating which one to play . . . There may be some remedy for this sort of thing , but so far no one seems to have found it . " Well , there is one unfailing remedy ? do not play with women like that . You can find plenty of others ? women who are good players and good sportsmen too . V There remain to be answered the weighty criticisms of a couple of psychologists , who burst into print during the Lenz-Culbertson duel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Professor Charles Gray Shaw of New York University , " but the quality ofthe brains developed is not worth cultivating . " Still harsher was Professor Harold Swenson of the University of Chicago : " You could n't drag a real thinker to the bridge table with a team of horses . " If this means anything except that a couple of professors were picking up crumbs of publicity from the mighty banquet of Culbertson , it means that Professor Swenson 's definition of a real thinker is a man who could n't be dragged to the bridge table by a team of horses . By any other definition he is demonstrably wrong . As for Professor Shaw , he is right this far ? that the brains specifically developed by bridge are good for nothing much but bridge ; but not so much can be said for his further statement that " the habitual bridge player lacks adequate emotional power and must play to stimulate his nerves . " If this , in turn , means that bridge is the refuge of men who do not like or are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like or are not pleasing to men , the only answer it calls for is a derisive snort . Confessing that I personally am one who prefers " Gbtterd:ammerung " to " Tristan , " I could cite some of the best bridge players I ever met , of both sexes , who have plenty of emotional power and do not go to the card table when they want their nerves stimulated . Possibly Professor Shaw 's intention was more general ; in which case his remarks may be true of some bridge players . Some years ago I was in one of the minor European monarchies ; and the day I left the capital a local newspaperman said to me , " Ca n't you stay over till to-morrow ? We have a date to go up to the Palace and play bridge with the King . " Somewhat flustered , I said that I could not aspire to such an honor . " Oh , it 's no particular honor , " he told me . " He gets lonesome up there at the Palace ; the Dictator wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always glad when somebody will come up to play bridge with him . " Bridge may be a needed stimulus to the nerves of unemployed royalty ; but for us ordinary players its stimulation is intellectual , not emotional , even if the intellect it stimulates is of a specialized and unprofitable type . A philosopher , says Aldous Huxley , is a man who dreams of fewer things than there are in heaven and earth ; and it is evident that Professor Shaw has never perceived the real attractions of bridge . Choose your company ? people who play not much better than you do andnot much worse , people who sit down at the bridge table to play bridge , not to talk about irrelevancies ? and you will find yourself transported into another world . The agitations and exacerbations of everyday life drop away from you ; for a while you dwell in a remote and austere realm of the pure intellect , uncontaminated by any practical applications ; and as your game improves you may catch glimpses of some of those mathematical beauties of sequence , distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it contemplates Itself .
