txt // millions of self-respecting families formerly independent . A class called " the new poor " has appeared in our society to whom the idea of being dependent on a welfare agency is abhorrent . And yet after a year or two of such dependence family pride sometimes breaks down and humiliation yields to indifference . In some cases a bitter sense of loss and social injustice sets up serious mental conflicts . During the current economic slump the savings of heads of families have vanished ; the homes on which they were hopefully making payments have been heavily mortgaged and in many instances entirely lost ; families have crowded into small apartments with generous parents or friends ; a mountain of debts has been piled up which can not be paid off except at the price of many years of labor . Destitution , with the loss of furniture , food , and even a roof over the family heads , stares every member in the face . Quarrels break out in families heretofore harmonious and in the words of a Philadelphia youth of nineteen whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose faith in ourselves . Family life becomes a chaotic mass . We do not trust each other . We quarrel and argue about in-significant matters . . . . We become so heated in our arguments that we begin to have fist fights , throwing chairs and utensils about . . . This finally ends in something more tragic . " When the family at last becomes utterly destitute , with no more money obtainable and all furnishings sold , the members " become a down-hearted brooding grou of famished bodies , too ill to care what becomes of us , too tired a fatigued to keep on living . " 32 The full effects of the present economic collapse upon the health o families are not yet apparent . Yet , despite the surprisingly low morbi ity and mortality statistics of the last five years , physicians and social workers testify that the health of both adults and children has been u dermined by malnutrition and the carking anxiety that accompanies sense of economic insecurity . As Williams has truly said : " The eff of malnutrition usually is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an unhealthy child . " He quotes from a letter received fr a State department of health in answer to inquiries made in the win of 1931 ? 1932 regarding the effect of the depression on the health // expectant mothers . " It has been apparent for some months past that women coming to the pre-natal consultations conducted by this Division ( Division of Maternity , Infancy and Child Hygiene ) are showing definitely the effects of insufficient or improper diet . In some cases it was reported that families had been living for weeks on potatoes , in which case they would not have fallen particularly low in weight but showed other evidences of improper nourishment . They all report husbands and other members of the family out of work and are depressed and hopeless . " 33 Williams also comments on the " tottering morale " and " shaken nerves " of unemployed members of families , and on the spread of juvenile delinquency , growing in part out of family need , and in part out of a situation in which boys out of work " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34 Perhaps the most disastrous aftermath of the national economic breakdown will prove to be the physical and moral deterioration of youth , not alone among the most impoverished groups , but also in the educated group of moderate income . These youths ? young men and women ? face a world in ferment , which offers them little hope of finding work , of attaining financial independence , of looking forward to the normal experiences of courtship , marriage , and founding a home . Dull hopelessness , an enfeebling sense of inadequacy , unprofitable idleness , and bitter rebellion have already driven many youths of both sexes into sexual license , delinquency , and crime . Bad Housing . One inevitable effect of low wages and unemployment is the segregation of the working class in ugly slums in which insanitary tenement houses rub elbows with each other , leaving few open spaces for the admission of light and air . The fundamental importance of decent housing conditions to the physical and moral health of every individual ? old and young ? seems obvious enough and has been pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elmer Wood , well-known housing authority , writes : " No nation can rise higher than the level of its homes . Whether we approach the subject from the point of view of // health , morals , child conservation , industrial efficiency , Americanization , or good citizenship , the housing problem is fundamental . " as More than a generation ago Germany and Belgium attacked the crucial problem of securing decent homes for their wage-earners , and England has made notable advances toward the solution of this problem . Nothing , however , was done in this country until the opening of the twentieth century , when numerous surveys of bad housing conditions were made in New York , Washington , Chicago , Boston , Pittsburgh , and other industrial centers . The New York City Tenement House Commission was first in the field in 1900 , and its admirable report led to the much-needed Tenement House Law of 1901 . Needless to say , all the surveys revealed unspeakably menacing and degrading conditions in those tenements occupied by the lowest-paid class of workers . Dr. Wood sums them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the United States are living under subnormal housing conditions , conditions which fall below the minimum standard we shall presently describe , and about a tenth are living under conditions which are an acute menace to health , morals and family life , conditions which tend to produce degenerative changes in those subject to them . . . . The same conditions meet us everywhere ? lot overcrowding and room overcrowding , dark rooms and inadequately lighted rooms , lack of water , lack of sanitary conveniences , dilapidation , excessive fire risks , basement and cellar dwellings.36 The district nurse and the social worker know only too well that tuberculosis rages in basement dwellings and dark , airless rooms . And the danger of contagion that threatens every family living under such conditions is multiplied by gross overcrowding . When the rent can not be paid without taking in lodgers , lodgers are received into the tenements of families already indecently huddled together . Byington found an appalling situation of this kind in Homestead in 1910 . In this steel city a study was made of twenty-one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Slavic workers were segregated . Among 239 families , 102 were taking in lodgers and in these latter families the average number of persons to a room was four . Fifty-one families were found each living in one room ; and two-room tenements were not rarely // occupied by a man , wife , two children , and two to three lodgers ! 37 Such conditions are directly responsible for sexual immorality , intemperance , and juvenile delinquency . And , as one writer satirically points out , we go on building hospitals , asylums , and reformatories ! Particularly harmful are such home conditions in their effects upon little children . Dr. Wood quotes Luther Burbank as saying : " All animal life is sensitive to environment , but of all living things the child is most sensitive . The child absorbs environment . " 33 So far as slum tenement children are concerned , it is the merest blind sentimentality to go on glorifying " the influence of the home . " These dark , ill-smelling dwellings , " pestilential in winter and purgatorial in summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesome family life . Children and youth alike leave them as often as possible for the street , the movie , and the dance hall , and parents are powerless to hold them . Byington says that Homestead mothers , knowing the dangers of the streets and of many commercialized amusements , " make a heroic and often pathetic effort to keep the home attractive enough to offset these temptations " ; but their endeavors would in most instances seem doomed to failure from the start . Not only the morals , but the vitality and the growth of children are menaced by the conditions prevailing in our most overcrowded tenements . Aronovici cites the results obtained by Dr. Mackenzie , of the Scottish Education Department , who in 1905 ? 1906 made a physical examination of 72,857 school children between the ages of five and eighteen . He found that Scotch boys living in one-room homes were on the average 11.7 pounds lighter in weight and 4.7 inches shorter than boys from four-room houses ; and girls from one-room homes were 14 pounds lighter and 5.3 inches shorter than girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The infant mortality rate in the most crowded tenements is cruelly high . Byington found that in the wretched dwellings of Homestead 's Second Ward the child death rate was double that in other wards . " 0 Poverty saps the vitality of both mother and infant ; and if the child grows to adult age , he is unable to // bear the strain of life . Low in vigor , he becomes the ready prey of occupational diseases and finds it hard to make a living that will ensure to his children the health and energy which he has never enjoyed . So the vicious circle is repeated . The conditions described above existed prior to the World War . During and for several years after that conflict , an acute housing shortage prevailed in many congested industrial centers of the United States and Europe which greatly aggravated the bad conditions already existing . Nor have housing conditions materially improved in this country during the last fifteen years . Most of the new houses erected in the United States since 1919 have been built for the middle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 2 per cent of the building permits issued in 1923 were granted for " one-family and two-family dwellings with shops " and " multi-family apartments with shops " because such dwellings do not yield a high return on the capital invested.41 When new detached homes and apartment houses are built for the relatively well-to-do classes , these buildings are promptly filled by families who have vacated inferior dwellings . It is these single or two-family houses , often run-down and sometimes lacking in modern conveniences , that are turned into tenements and occupied by laborers ? the better ones by skilled workers , the less desirable by low-paid labor . According to the housing report cited above , of all families provided for by new housing in 1921 , 58.3 per cent were furnished with one-family dwellings , 2.3 per cent with one-family and two-family dwellings with shops , and 1.3 per cent with multi-family apartments with shops . In 1923 conditions were little better . Of all the families provided with new housing in the United States , 45.8 per cent were furnished with one-family dwellings costing $871,704,763 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops at a cost of $50,315,146.42 Confronted before and after the World War with a housing situation no whit better than that in the United States , several countries of Europe have attacked this problem with far-sighted intelligence and with a sense of national responsibility which puts the United States to shanty . England was first in the field by beginning the work of slum clearance // as early as 1889 , when forty-two acres of London slums were cleared . Since the World War the London County Council has provided new dwellings for more than 100,000 persons and has cleaned out twentythree dirty and unhealthful areas comprising ninety-eight acres.43 Unfortunately , the houses erected in England ( 1,177,863 in number ) between the Armistice and March , 1934 , have been for the most part too high-priced to meet the needs of workers . Therefore , the government enacted the Housing Act of 1930 restricting the activities of local authorities in the housing field to slum-clearance and rehousing and placing the responsibility for such programs squarely upon the shoulders of these authorities . According to Mary Simkhovitch , 44 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is geared to abolish the slum evil in the next five years . . . . The schedule provides for the demolition of 53,200 houses and the erection of 57,000 , annually for the next five years . . . . Realizing the necessity for adequate subsidies to provide low-rental homes , the government increased its contributions for housing from ? 11,875,806 in 1930 ? 31 to ? 13,645,000 in 1933 ? 34 . To clear away the 200,000 houses and to provide the necessary new ones in five years as pledged , the government , according to the Minister of Health , will be required to spend L95,000,000. " 4b ( About $475,000,000 . ) Perhaps Holland has accomplished more than any other European state in the great work of housing its people . This small country began its attack on bad housing in 1901 , when it adopted a policy of loaning money to cities for the erection of sanitary dwellings in slum areas . Public utilities and cooperative societies might also receive loans from the national treasury if the organizations were guaranteed by municipal governments . The loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up to 100 per cent of the building costs . In the city of Amsterdam , where more than 10 per cent of the population of Holland lives , building societies erected homes for 4,573 families between 1909 and 1917 . A year later the Dutch government began making outright subsidies for housing , and as a result in the decade between 1918 and 1928 private societies built 11,000 new dwellings . The city itself entered the ousing field in 1919 in a fine effort to meet a genuine housing emer- // gency ; and during the next decade , despite grave difficulties owing to the shifting sands and soft mud of the terrain , the city has built model tenements and cottages in garden suburbs which house 7,000 families . Since the World War more than 15,000 homes for workers have been provided in Amsterdam alone . Germany also vigorously attacked her emergency housing problem after the War . At first one-family houses were built in the suburbs of German cities by building societies which received government aid . Since 1924 , however , multi-family houses and apartments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of families from four to twelve in number , have been erected in large numbers in the suburbs of German cities . In Cologne since 1919 over 22,000 houses have been built , two thirds of them by building societies with municipal aid . Perhaps the most interesting housing campaign in Europe was carried on in the socialist city of Vienna prior to the ruthless suppression of the Socialist Party by Dollfuss early in 1934 . This municipality by its own efforts has erected the finest apartments for its workers of any city in the world . Believing that the capital for these workers ' homes should be provided by citizens with means , through a drastic system of taxation , the municipal government of Vienna housed over 30,000 workers ' families in model apartments between 1925 and 1928 . Since the government expected no return on the invested capital , it was able to lease these homes to impoverished workers for a nominal rent , covering the cost of upkeep , and demanding only 2 per cent of the average worker 's income . The tenements cover only half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even , in some cases , a swimming pool . " What has America accomplished in the battle against the slums ? The reply may be given in two words ? almost nothing . Relying up to very recent times upon private initiative and limited dividend companies , the United States has a meager record of accomplishments in housing since the World War . A few model apartments were erected several years ago in the metropolitan area of New York through the efforts of John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company . But with the exception of the Metropolitan 's project on Long Island the tenements rent for from $12 to $15 a room monthly  --  a // rental far too high for the majority of workers . Certain garden-city projects have also been carried out , such as the model settlements at Sunnyside , Long Island , and Radburn , New Jersey ; but these homes were designed for salaried workers of moderate income . In 1926 , when it became apparent that private initiative could not be counted upon to build homes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law . The law provides a form of partnership between the State , the city , and private enterprise . Plans for slum clearance and rehousing are carried out by private enterprise through the limited dividend corporation , while the State and city provide financial encouragement and some degree of regulation . New York State has cooperated by establishing the State Board of Housing , which oversees and approves all slum-clearance projects . The Housing Law also provides freedom from State taxes for all new housing in slum areas erected by limited dividend companies whose plans have the approval of the State Board , and further grants the power of condemning land to public limited-dividend corporations . No such company can be incorporated or carry on any housing enterprise without the consent of the State ( rousing Board , which is empowered to supervise and regulate limiteddividend companies in the interest of tenants and stockholders . Cities in New York State have been requested to imitate State action by exemtpting from municipal taxation housing erected by approved housing companies . New York City enacted such an ordinance in 1927 . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been erected , such as the large housing project of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Corporation in the Bronx , the model apartment use at Grand and Chrystie Streets in lower New York , and the rooklyn Garden Apartment in that borough . But it has become abundantly clear that the stupendous task of clearing the slums of our cities can not be left to limited-dividend companies , even when given State ICI and encouragement . A few such companies have been organized d a few model tenements erected , 47 but hardly a dent has been made t h e n mountainous undertaking of rehousing American workers in decent homes . During the past two years the public mind in our country has been // educated through the efforts of the National Public Housing Conference 48 and other organizations , as well as by the pronouncements and active efforts of the federal government , to a belief that slum-clearance and the rehousing of low-income families is a public responsibility ? a task which should be planned and executed by public authorities . In the great work of public housing New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter of 1933 a bill was introduced into the State legislature providing for Municipal Housing Authorities in the cities of the State . This first public housing bill was enacted into law in 1934 , with the vigorous support of the governor and the mayor of New York City . Under the leadership of Mayor La Guardia a Municipal Housing Authority has been organized in New York City and a vigorous attack on problems of slum-removal and model housing has begun . New York 's public housing bill has furnished suggestions for similar legislation in the eight or nine States which have provided for municipal housing authorities . The city of Detroit has a well-developed plan for slum clearance and model housing to be financed largely by the federal government . Nine blocks of slum homes will be replaced by model apartments in which rents will average a little over six dollars per room monthly , in contrast with a rental of twelve dollars per room or more charged by most limited-dividend companies . Excellent city housing plans are also under way in Milwaukee and Los Angeles . Recently the mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many-sided problem of municipal housing . In his excellent report to the mayor the commissioner , Mr. Nathan Straus , made the following vigorous statements and recommenda-tions : It is a fact that 1,500,000 people in this city are forced to live in crimefostering and disease-breeding tenements . It is a fact that New York City still has buildings built in 1879 which contain more than 250,000 rooms without windows to the outer air . It is a fact that about one-third of the families of New York City have incomes of less than $1,500 a year . These are the conditions which necessitate a governmental low-cost housing program . No private builder in New York City can build to meet the rental pocketbooks of the 500,000 families which now live in slums and must be rehoused . These families can afford only rents in the neighborhood of $20 per month . // A program of low cost housing construction by cities with Federal Government aid will be competition to private industry only so far as private industry continues to maintain slum tenements . Is that not , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inauguration of the New York City rehousing program be not delayed out of consideration for the man who owns and maintains a slum tenement to house human beings for his own profit , but that the policy be declared instead that it is the determination of the city government to compel the destruction of slums and to rehouse slumdwellers in new government housing projects , at certain definite rates and in certain specified areas . The rights of the taxpayers and the protection of the health of the people of the city are paramount to the rights of a few owners of the slums.49 The Federal Government has been actively concerned with the problem of housing since the inauguration of the present administration in March , 1933 . President Roosevelt in no uncertain terms has proclaimed his interest in clearance of the slums as inimical to public health and morals . He is also interested in a national program for rehousing American workers as a means of putting thousands of unemployed laborers to work . The Secretary of the Interior and his aides have organized a Housing Division under the Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal funds for the purchase of land , for slum clearance , and for low-cost housing projects throughout the country . It is the plan of the Housing Division to construct under federal auspices homes for the lowest-income groups which will rent for six dollars per room monthly ? or even less . On November 8 , 1935 , it was announced from Washington that the Public Works Administration has purchased or put under option land for fifty housing projects in thirty-five cities.i0 Unfortunately the whole movement has slowed down in recent months . At last , then , municipal , State , and federal authorities in these United States are cautiously becoming committed to the policy of public housing as the only sure means of removing dark , dingy , vermin-infested ' hint houses and replacing them with homes , in the city or in suburban districts , supplied with ample light , air , and play-space . It may be that in the years to come America will take its place beside certain European countries dedicated to the total removal of slum areas as a menace to the family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mothers and Children . When , because of low wages , unemployment , or sickness , the father is unable to earn even a minimum living wage , the mother and sometimes the children of school age are driven out of the home to seek work . This is a fact with which we are so familiar that it is accepted as a matter of course . But the consequences that follow from the all-day ' employment of women with young children are by no means fully understood or appreciated . Yet a week 's visiting in the tenement districts would drive home to our minds the deplorable results that sometimes ensue from this practice . Obviously , if the mother is needed at home to prepare food for the family , to wash , mend , clean , and care for babies or toddling children , these essential tasks are very largely neglected if she is forced to work in factory or shop from eight to ten hours . To be sure many women in these circumstances make a heroic effort to carry on two jobs . They buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the washing or cleaning after a weary day 's work ; they put an old mother or aunt in charge of the children , if they are fortunate enough to have such a relative available . If not , the older girl or boy is kept home from school to watch the babies ; or the mother turns over part of her meager wages into a fund to pay a neighbor to take care of several families of small children . Needless to say , home care and home training may suffer woefully under this regime . And the wife and mother not infrequently breaks down under the double strain , as the records of hospitals and charitable organizations all too clearly show . Urban Life and the Family . As we have seen , urban life is almost identical with industry , since where great industrial plants are established large towns and cities tend to grow up . Thousands of men and women flock to these centers for employment , and , in the absence of civic housing commissions empowered to furnish decent homes for these laborers , there follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities , where density of population is greatest , morbidity and mortality tend to increase and infectious diseases spread most easily . The unwholesome effects of tenement-house living in our slum districts might be mitigated if there were a sufficient number of parks and // playgrounds to which tenement dwellers could resort without expense and loss of time . But here , again , city life tends to react unfavorably upon individuals and families . Although much has been done in many of our large industrial centers , notably in Chicago and more recently in New York , to bring air , space , and sunshine within the reach of every citizen , something remains to be done in not a few cities . In 1923 the United States Bureau of Education sought to discover , by means of a questionnaire sent to superintendents of schools , how many cities with a population of 30,000 or over were maintaining playgrounds , other than school playgrounds , out of public funds . Of the seventy cities having a population of 100,000 or more , fifty-eight replied , and fifty-two of this number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the cities having a population between 30,000 and 100,000 , 128 replied to the questionnaire , and of this number ninetyseven cities were maintaining municipal playgrounds . This means that at least 75 per cent of our largest cities and nearly 76 per cent of our smaller cities are awake to the need of play-spaces for children . Unfortunately , the Bureau did not investigate the adequacy of these playgrounds , in point of numbers and location , to meet the needs of all the children in our centers of population . The study did , however , bring out the facts that ( 1 ) a wide disparity of standards exists with respect to the amount of play-space necessary for each child and ( 2 ) marked differences exist in the provisions for a trained director of sports and games . " Apparently city life has its effects upon births , marriages , and divorces . Although the urban birth rate in the United States slightly exceeded that in small towns and rural districts in every year of the period 1915-1930 , since that time the reverse has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 or over was 17.5 ; in the remainder of the national area ( villages , small towns , and farming districts ) the birth rate was 18.4 . In 1932 the respective rates were 16.7 and 18.1. ' 3 Although it is probable that more women in rural areas are being delived in city hospitals than ever before , a situation tending to raise the reorded birth rate in cities and to depress it in farming regions ; yet , so , the vigorously proclaimed superiority of rural districts in the // matter of births is tending to disappear . Unquestionably , the birth rate is steadily falling in both country and city . Yet it is still true that the number of children under five years of age per thousand women fifteen to forty-four years of age was markedly higher in 1930 in the rural farm population than in cities of over 100,000 population . The ratio was 545 to 293 , ' 4 which means , of course , that there were not far from twice as many children under five years per women of child-bearing age on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " Population and Occupational Shifts " made in November , 1934 , Dr. O. E. Baker of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics offered a significant and arresting suggestion . Pointing out that a wife and children are assets in farming areas where the family is the economic unit , but are largely economic liabilities in urban districts where industry is supreme , he inferred that " a civilization based primarily on an industrial and commercial system in which the individual is the economic unit is likely to develop a declining population as agriculture becomes relatively less important . " If the steady decrease in population is to be stemmed , and civilization made permanent , he believes that society " must be based primarily on agriculture , or on some other culture in which the family is the economic unit . " In his judgment , if a system of part-time farming associated with industrial and commercial employment does not accomplish the objective of at least a stationary population , " it will be slowly replaced , I believe , by an agricultural civilization in which many industries will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century ago . " Holding that a nation should not grow old , he adds : " How can a nation live long ? By recognizing that the land is the foundation of the family , and that the family is the foundation of the State . " 55 Dr. Baker offers no plan by which our present civilization , strongly urban and industrial in character , may be succeeded by a society rooted in agriculture . Even at the risk of declining populations , it seems highly improbable that the peoples of advanced industrial nations will deliberately turn the hands of history 's clock backwards and return to a simple civilization grounded in tillage of the soil . The effect of urban life on marriage and divorce remains for brief con- // consideration . Ogburn , using the census of 1920 , has classified 170 cities according to the percentage of population engaged in manufacturing and also according to the percentage twenty-five years of age and over who were married . He finds that cities which have larger percentages engaged in manufacturing have larger percentages married . " This strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that manufacturing increases marriage perhaps through some such factor as wages or employment . . . . " Also the excess of males over females in manufacturing centers " has had its influence upon the increase of marriage . " On the other hand , Ogburn 's data show that where there is relatively a large employment of women in these industrial cities , there tend to be smaller percentages of women married , showing that the employment of women " tends slightly to delay marriage if not actually to discourage it . " On the whole Ogburn 's studies point to the conclusion that city life discourages marriage . Whereas 61.8 per cent of the rural population fifteen years of age and over were married in 1920 , only 58.3 per cent of urban communities were married ? a difference of 3.5 per cent . If the age distribution were the same for city and country ( which it is not , since youth seeks the city ) , the disparity would be even greater ? 63.5 per cent of the age group fifteen and over married in the rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As perhaps might be expected , the percentage of persons reported as divorced and living in cities is larger than the corresponding percentage living in rural districts . Ogburn has further found that the excess percentage of women divorced over men is greater for cities than for the country . Moreover , he concludes that cities that have larger percentages 1 ) f young persons married also have larger percentages of divorced persons ; and cities which have lower birth rates also have larger percent ; ages divorced . This last condition may be in part explained by the wellknown fact that children tend to hold married pairs together , whereas the highest ratio of divorces is found in childless families . By way of summary it may be said that urban life apparently tends somewhat to depress birth rates , to discourage marriage , and to increase divorce . What conditions in our cities are responsible for these outcomes is not yet clearly understood . But it may not be over rash to suggest that // the economy of olden times , rooted in the land , thrived upon high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families ; whereas our urban industrial economy , competitive , individualistic , mobile , based upon money income instead of upon tillage , affords little of that powerful cement in ownership of land and homestead that held families together in the past and made of children welcome economic assets . One important outcome of city dwelling remains to be considered . It can hardly be doubted that our " modern Babylons , " with their huge populations , develop mass habits which insidiously undermine family life . It has been said that " men work in crowds , eat in crowds , seek recreation in crowds , and satisfy sex impulse in public brothels . " Among the wealthy in our largest cities , such as New York , Chicago , Detroit , and San Francisco , meals are more and more often eaten in hotels and fashionable restaurants ; dinners , bridge parties , dances , and even marriages take place in public resorts with ever increasing frequency . A great metropolitan daily published some time ago a racy article on the theme " Dining Out with Kitchenless New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the homes of all but the prosperous , the writer continues : How often do you hear in New York of big dinners , fashionable dinners , at private homes ? Even the luncheons and suppers are given at public or semipublic places . A single New York hotel , aware of this demand , has forty-two private dining rooms and banquet halls , and others are hardly less amply supplied ; in addition and supplementary to which there are scores of descendants of Delmonico's.69 Needless to say life en masse is even more general among the poor . In the ranks of the unskilled laborers , homes are places in which to snatch a hasty meal , to find a corner of bed or floor or table not preempted by family members or lodgers on which to sleep ? and then to get away from it to the street , the factory , the cheap amusement place . Even the middle-class home in our largest cities is being profoundly affected by the trend toward public mass living and eating . To quote once more from the Times article : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with amazing speed , sometimes to amazing proportions . Old houses are being re59 New York Times , Magazine Section , January 25 , 1925. // modeled by the thousand into small suites , and in them not even the kitchenette is to be found . Here , in dwellings that once sheltered families of means , and probably of size , with a cook for each family and a minor tribe of servants , even " light housekeeping " is forbidden . The law requires expensive and unsightly fireescapes front and back if there be more than one kitchen apparatus on the premises . The tenant is forbidden to enjoy so much as the modest comfort of an electric toaster . But the real estate agent and the " superintendent , " meaning the janitor , seldom incline to take the rule too seriously . It is tacitly understood that breakfast and perhaps lunch will be prepared at home . Everybody does it .

But as a rule the " familette " goes out to dinner , and as a consequence there has come into existence here a kind of restaurant specially dedicated to the kitchenless , an asylum for those who will never know the kind of pie mother used to make . It is an institution indigenous to New York , and apparently peculiar to it . Other cities have their counterparts of Sherry 's and Pierre 's , their likenesses to the chain restaurants which besprinkle this island ; and everywhere will be found lunch rooms for the business man of all degrees , from the clerk to the corporation executive ; but where else will be found places calculated solely to catch the dinner trade of the kitchenless middle-class family ?

The rapacious landlord takes this toll despite the abolition of the kitchen . Enter now the children of Father Knickerbocker ? a floor manager in a department store , his idle and discontented wife ; their daughter , who is a filing clerk in a downtown warren of concrete and steel ; and their son , from whose chaff a dispirited Columbia Faculty is trying to winnow a grain of usefulness . They scan the bill of fare with varying degrees of intensity or distaste , and eat amid a monosyllabic silence . The girl pays her own check . The four are a slice of that vast people , New York 's middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a keg of their own ale , mostly froth at the top and dregs at the bottom , but thoroughly sound in the middle . The population of this town is more like a bottle of fermented buttermilk , an // artificial product throughout but advertised as healthful . If the kitchenette spreads over the country , as the Playgrounds and Recreation folk fear it will , and then tends to vanish as it is doing here , what is to be the fate of a nation founded upon the family ? What will be the psychological and social outcomes of such continuous mass living ? asks the student of social conditions . What the effect upon marriage and the family ? The most resolute advocate of the status quo will hardly maintain that the intimate family associations of bygone times can be so metamorphosed in our huge cities without profoundly affecting the family institution . Unquestionably the rising generation is destined to see a further transformation of family life brought about , in part , by the widespread development of mass habits of living and thinking in congested centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such changes will prove either disastrous or beneficial . Neither the dark prophecies of the reactionary nor the easy optimism of the advocates of social change should determine the judgment of intelligent men and women with regard to this many-sided question . We need not only more concrete evidence concerning the social causes of family change , but we need also to develop still further an objective attitude toward the study of family problems . Whether the family of the future succeeds or fails depends in no small measure upon a far more general spread of exact knowledge with respect to the social conditions which impede its functioning . CHAPTER IX WAGE-EARNING MOTHERS Women in Gainful Employment . AMONG the many economic and social changes that mark the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries none is more arresting to the student of social history or more far-reaching in its effects , than the influx of women into gainful occupations outside the home . It is a commonplace to say that women have followed their ancient employments of food preparation , weaving , garment making , nursing , and teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a commonplace so trite that we may easily overlook the enormous import of the facts . Beginning in the late eighteenth century , there has been a steady infiltration of women into paid employments , until , in the third decade of the twentieth century , the body of women in gainful work had swelled to a mighty army in Germany , France , Great Britain , and America . In the United States the number of women ten years of age and over who were gainfully occupied in 1930 is reported in the census as 10,752 , - 116 . This number represents an increase of 2,203,605 , or 25.7 per cent over the figures for 1920 . The range of occupations which women are entering is a broadening one ; of the 534 separate occupations classified in the last census , women are employed in all but 30.1 Moreover , between 1920 and 1930 the proportional increase of employed women in all agegroups of twenty years and over was greater than their population increase . Very significant , also , is the report of the Women 's Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women workers are married . Whereas the increase in employment of all women in the last census decade was over 25 per cent , the increase of employed married women was nearly 60 per cent . A bulletin published in 1922 by the Women 's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor entitled " Family Status of Breadwinning 1 // Women in Four Selected Cities " brings to light some facts that stimulate thought . In the four cities ? Jacksonville , Wilkes-Barre , Hanover Township , Butte ( Montana ) , and Passaic ? the number of gainfully employed women ( 38,446 ) " constituted over 38 per cent of the entire female population fourteen years of age and over reported in these communities . " In Jacksonville and Passaic , the percentages were respectively forty-five and forty-six . Of this army of employed women , approximately 55 per cent were or had been married ; and of this group ( 21 , - 000 ) , over 61 per cent were living with wage-earning husbands ! The Bulletin declares further that it " was not chiefly the childless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly 53 per cent of all the gainfully employed matrons had children , and 40 per cent of these mothers had babies under five years . " Nor were these women boarding ; almost four fifths of the women breadwinners who were or had been married were maintaining homes . Nearly one half of this married group were engaged in gainful employments that took them outside their own homes.3 Since the above study was made , the influx of married women into gainful employment has increased at a high rate . In a survey made at the University of Pennsylvania in December , 1931 , of the ousting of married women from jobs in Philadelphia , some striking facts were brought to light . It was found that 55,000 married women were normally employed in Philadelphia ; but of this number 11,000 had lost their jobs and another 10,000 were working part time . About 34,000 wives were working full time . In 9,960 of these families , or over 29 per cent , the only earnings were those of a married woman employed full time ; in more than 5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part time , making the earnings of the wife essential to the support of the family . Even with the aid of the wife 's earnings , the struggle for bare subsistence was severe and in some families the members were fighting a losing battle . In the report of the survey the grim statement was made that " many of these families may already be below the level of minimum health and comfort . In many others , further rewt ion of the family income would immediately result in this condition . " // A report of the Civil Works Administration in Pennsylvania covering the period from November 15 , 1933 to March 31 , 1934 , shows that over one fourth of an army of 13,329 women employed on work projects during this time were or had been married . These 13,329 women reported 17,387 dependents " for three-fourths of whom they were entirely responsible . " The report declares that there is no doubt that the married women are carrying a large share of this burden . ' Similarly , in a study covering over 10,000 women applicants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over one fourth of the women were married . Two thirds of this group had dependents , one tenth had four or more dependents and 120 women actually had seven or more human beings to care for . CAUSES OF ENTRY OF MARRIED WOMEN INTO GAINFUL OCCUPATIONS The reasons why married women are leaving their age-old domestic employments for the factory , the shop , and the laundry are not far to seek . As Gwendolyn Hughes has pointed out : The mother 's economic function in the home is encroached upon whenever a labor-saving device is adopted and whenever a factory product is substituted for a homemade article . The mother 's contribution as a producer is reduced , while the demand of the family for a money income to buy the new commodity is correspondingly augmented . ' When the question " Why did you go back to work after you were married ? " was put to 728 working mothers in Philadelphia , the largest group ( 29 per cent ) answered , " My husband was n't making enough . " " My husband was dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband was sick , " was the answer of 14 per cent . " He left me , " was the reply of 13 per cent ; while 11 per cent answered , " He would n't support me . " Thus 89 per cent of these mothers were in real need of paid employment ; only 11 per cent stated that they " would rather work . " ' It is poverty that sends the mother from the home at seven o'clock in the morning , after she has washed and fed her children , to labor for a // full or part-time day in order to supplement an income that no amount of " stretching " will make adequate to house , feed , and clothe the family . In England and America alike , careful investigations , carried on by trained workers , reveal the same causes . The British Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Physical Deterioration , made to Parliament in 1904 , states the reasons for the labor of English wage-earning mothers as being ( 1 ) death of the father or lack of employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) desertion by the father ; ( 3 ) fear on the mother 's part of loss of future work in the factory ; ( 4 ) preference for factory over domestic work . The report adds that the " great majority of cases may be said to fall under one or other of the three sub-divisions in class ( 1 ) . " 8 Among 120 cases of married women at work in Manchester , England , only six could be discovered in which the wife 's wage-earning occupations were explained on the ground of preference . In Liverpool , the wives were reported to be at work because their husbands were " often casual labourers or drunkards . " From Newcastle came the report that wives were wage-earners from necessity and not from choice . Their work was unattractive and often exhausting , " and not one of them seems to take the slightest pleasure in it . " 9 When we turn to America , similar conditions are found to prevail . Katherine Anthony 's committee made a house-to-house study of 370 working mothers living in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following facts regarding their conjugal condition and the ability of their husbands to support the family : // It will be noted that considerably less than half of these women had husbands who contributed to the family support , and one third were widows . In every family where the husband was at work ( 163 ) he earned less than $500 a year and the earnings of the mother , or both mother and children , were essential to the support of the family . In ninety-six of these families the mother 's earnings constituted 31 per cent of the family income ; in sixty-seven families , 18.8 per cent . Commenting on these facts , Miss Anthony says : Too often we hear these women spoken of as if some perversity of instinct drove them to neglect their homes and go to work at the expense of their homes and children . It is for the sake of their children that they work , as mothers have done from time immemorial . The last penny of their earnings is absorbed by their homes . Visit one of them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The money which the woman has earned on her hands and knees is spent in the Tenth Avenue stores and comes back into the home in the form of meat for Sunday 's dinner and warm new clothing for the children . She buys little for herself but the bare necessities and even these she often foregoes.12 A study made in 1923 by the Women 's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor of men and women wage-earners in the shoe industry in Manchester , New Hampshire , disclosed that in the great majority of families where married women were wage-earners , there were one or more dependents to be supported , and the women 's wages were of real value . In 85 per cent of the 113 families investigated , where the wife was contributing to the family income , the husband 's wages were $1,500 or less ? in the great majority of cases less . In twenty-one families , the father earned less than $1,000 . The investigators concluded their study of the contributions of these married women to the family income with the statement : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings raises the median of per capita earnings from $438 , which is considerably below the median for all families , to $641 , which is considerably above , leaves little doubt that the earnings of the married women in the majority of these cases were important in keeping up the standard of living for their families . " 13 Over the heads of most wage-earning wives and mothers hangs the // fear that on any day the husband may come home with his overalls and bag ' and announce that he has been " fired . " Unemployment is the bogy of the laboring class , especially the unskilled group . At any time the mother may find herself the sole support of the family . Miss Anthony vividly describes the curse of unemployment that visits the families of unskilled wage-earners in the middle west side district of New York Sometimes it strikes a man without a word of warning . His wife sees him coming home in the middle of the morning and she knows what has happened even before he speaks . If she is apt at nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular misfortune . Sometimes it strikes the family just when they have begun to entertain hopes and to make plans . The Gurneys had just moved into a four-room flat with rent at $16 . They had formerly lived in a rear tenement , but Mr. Gurney , who was a cab driver , thought he was " in steady " for awhile . Then one day Mrs. Gurney , coming home in the afternoon , " saw his boots and his bandbox with his hat in the middle of the room . " Mr. Gurney was nowhere about . He had gone out again after leaving these silent witnesses of misfortune . Mrs. Gurney threw herself on the bed and wept despairingly . The Gurneys were soon living in a basement . MOTHERHOOD AND WAGE-EARNING A high proportion of married women in gainful employments are mothers ; and , indeed , this fact , as we have seen , is a most powerful motive impelling them to work outside the home . A study made by the Women 's Bureau in 1922 of nearly 10,000 women breadwinners in Passaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were or had been married , and nearly three fourths of the married or once-married group were others . Of these mothers , 1,800 were employed outside the home ; and nearly 60 per cent had children under five years of age . ' 5 Similar conditions have been disclosed by the Children 's Bureau in its studies of infant mortality in Manchester , New Hampshire , and New Bedford , Massachusetts . In the textile manufacturing city of Manchester , during selected period ? November 1 , 1912 , to October 31 , 1913-1,643 ' hers were investigated , all of whom had borne children during that year . Of these , 722 , or 43.9 per cent , were gainfully employed within or outside the home after the birth of the child . In New Bedford , 2,662 // similar cases were studied , in 1,242 of which ( nearly 43 per cent ) the mothers entered paid employment after childbirth.l " These facts and figures could readily be reproduced in most of the great textile manufacturing centers of New England and the South . Effects of the Employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these breadwinning mothers upon the home and the nurture of children under school age ? The consequences have been repeatedly summed up as harmful with respect to home management , child care and training , and infant mortality ? not to mention the large number of abortions that are brought about through the necessity of the mother 's employment . Let us examine each of these counts in the light of such facts as are well substantiated ; for assuredly no progress will ever be made in solving these tangled social questions by the easy method of wholesale acceptance of unexamined opinions , especially when these opinions are more often than not grounded upon emotional prejudice . Since a high infant mortality rate is asserted to be directly attributable to the gainful employment of mothers and prospective mothers , let us begin our examination with this social condition . Infant Mortality among Employed and Non-employed Mothers . Owing to the indications in the federal census of inordinately high infant death rates in the textile and shoe manufacturing cities of New England , the Children 's Bureau began a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the causes of this social phenomenon . As stated above , the studies in Manchester and New Bedford revealed that many hundreds of mothers with infants less than a year old were employed in these industrial centers , whereas a greater number of mothers were not engaged in gainful work . Such a condition made possible some interesting and highly significant comparisons of the infant mortality rate among wage-earning and non-wage-earning mothers . In Manchester , 1,643 mothers were included in the study , to all of whom child re had been born in the selected year ( 1912-1913 ) . Of these women , 86 were not gainfully employed during the year preceding the birth of the WAGE-EARNING MOTHERS 175 child and 776 were gainfully employed . The infant mortality rate 17 for the unemployed women was 133.9 ; for the breadwinning mothers , 199.2 . Another striking fact brought out by the study was the smaller infant death rate among women engaged in wage-earning occupations at home before the birth of the child when compared with those going out into the factories to work . The rates follow : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women carrying on paid emloyments in their homes show a higher infant death rate than women of so employed , the rate of this group is conspicuously lower than that f the women factory operatives . Still-births were also less numerous mong the home workers . The study made three years later in New Bedford , Massachusetts , lows similar findings : 19 figure Employment of mothers shortly after the birth of the child also results in a high infant death rate . In Manchester , this rate was 220.9 for played mothers , as compared with 122 for mothers not gainfully erned . In New Bedford , 475 mothers resumed work away from home o left infants under one year of age . " If the average infant mortality o for the city for the remainder of the year had prevailed among them , // a total of 29 deaths would have occurred ; but actually 43 of these infants died . The ratio of 43 to 29 expresses the extra mortality among these infants of gainfully employed mothers . " 20 An important cause of the high infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding of the child . Breastfed children showed a uniformly lower death rate in both Manchester and New Bedford . The younger the baby , the more marked the harmful effect of the mother 's absence , both in depriving the infant of her care and in depriving it of breast milk . Of 119 babies in Manchester whose mothers began working away from home before the baby was four months old , thirty-three died before the end of the first year ? a mortality rate of 277.3 , as compared with the rate of 121.7 for the remainder of the group , namely 1,389 babies.21 As might be expected , a much higher proportion of gainfully employed women resort to artificial feeding of infants than is true of non-wage-earning women . In New Bedford , 45.9 per cent of women gainfully employed away from home were feeding their babies artificially at the age of three months , as compared with 24.3 per cent of unemployed mothers . In Manchester 65.5 per cent of the babies of mothers employed away from home were artificially fed , as compared with 28.5 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only is artificial feeding less beneficial to infants , when the mother has an ample supply of good milk , but it is rendered virulently harmful by the careless methods of preparation and sterilization used by ignorant and hurried mothers . If all the women included in these two studies had received careful instruction in the preparation of modified milk for their babies , the infant death rate from gastric and intestinal diseases would no doubt have fallen sharply . As evidence of the truth of this statement the following fact will serve . More native-born than foreign-born wonted in New Bedford used artificial feeding of their infants ; but the infant . mortality rate among the native-born group was considerably lower than among the ignorant Portuguese mothers who fed their babies artificially " There are many different types of artificial feeding , " writes Jessamine Whitney in the New Bedford report : // .. . the mother who gives her baby modified milk in accordance with a physician 's prescription , and who observes carefully all the rules for cleanliness and sterilization , is classed as giving artificial feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of providing pure , clean milk or one who gives her baby condensed milk , solid food , coffee or tea . The contrast is well illustrated in the following descriptions of the feeding of two infants both classed as artificially fed . When Baby A cried , his milk bottle was picked up from the dirty floor , partly filled with condensed milk from the can , then placed under the faucet and filled up with water . The nipple was also recovered from the floor and Baby A was fed . For Baby B the bottles were kept sterilized ; the milk , the best obtainable , was modified in accordance with a physician 's directions and the ingredients of the formula were carefully measured ; the temperature was properly regulated . Baby B was fed at regular intervals ; he was seen at least once a week by a doctor , and the milk formula h- as changed when necessary . Both these babies were " artificially fed . " 22 The fact that stands out clearly from the above excerpt is that articial feeding in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , r example , the sharp fall in the infant death rate in recent years . is due of only to better prenatal care of mothers in maternity centers and by siting nurses , but also to improved methods of artificial feeding due to e careful instruction given to mothers who are as ignorant as their own babes of the paramount importance of cleanliness , sterilization , and d formulas adapted to the child . Even if it be granted that breast feeding of infants is , on the whole , erior to the best of artificial feeding , this need not constitute an inrable barrier to the employment of nursing mothers . In France , ere many married women are gainfully employed , the law of 1917 reres that " for one year after the birth of the child , nursing mothers 1 be allowed one hour a day during hours of work for the purpose of ing their infants . " This hour is divided into two periods of thirty mites each , one during the morning and one during the afternoon . 1u mother shall always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nursing rooms must be set up in or near any establishment where n than 100 women over fifteen years of age are employed ; and " the conditions as regards construction , hygiene and supervision " of these ing rooms " shall be determined by public administrative regula- // In 1925 the Children 's Bureau undertook another investigation of the causal factors in infant mortality in eight cities . The mortality rate for about 7,000 infants whose mothers had worked away from home was 176.1 , as compared with 114.6 for those whose mothers worked at home and 98 for those whose mothers had not been gainfully employed . This tells the same tale as the earlier studies . But it is significant that the infant death rate in families with crowded home conditions ( two or more persons per room ) was two and one half times higher than in homes with less than one person per room . This points to poverty as a major cause of high infant mortality ; only the low-income groups reveal conditions of housing congestion . In its summary of the economic factors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low income for high infant death rates extended beyond the mortality directly associated with it , covering much of that associated with housing congestion and with the mother 's employment . The study of the chain of causation connecting low income with high mortality showed the direct relation between lack of means and the care available both for the mother during pregnancy and confinement and for the baby during his first year . It suggested , therefore , that if adequate care had been available for the mothers and babies in the low-income groups the high mortality rates of the babies in these groups would not have been found . ' ? Some striking facts have emerged from studies of infant mortality rates in the group of gainfully employed mothers in England . In Manchester , England , the infant mortality rate was 267 per thousand in the cases where the mothers were not employed outside the home and 210 in cases where they were so employed.24 The same condition was found to exist in Birmingham , where the infant death rate in 1910 , in the case of mothers employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per 1,000 births ; among mothers who remained at home it was 161 per 1,000 births.23 Obviously some factors are at work determining infant mortality other than the gainful employment of mothers in factories . 1 ) r . Ashby does not hesitate to declare that the chief of these is " poverty which , together with ignorance , perhaps , more than anything else dominates the situation . " 2 ' // These and other factors responsible for high infant death rates will be considered below ; but the question of the causal relationship of the gainful employment of mothers to infant mortality should not be left without consideration of an important contributory fact . Mothers employed outside the home are carrying a dual job ? a full day 's work and the manifold duties of housekeeping and child care . No fair test of the effects on infant mortality of extra-domestic employment of mothers can possibly be made until this condition is eliminated . A mother tired out by an eight-hour or ten-hour day in a factory is in no condition to give careful , intelligent physical care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the baby would not flourish if it received that care in a neighborhood nursery at the hands of specialists in child-rearing . If mothers are forced out of the home by economic pressure to augment the family income , it would seem that more intelligent measures for meetng this situation could be devised than have yet been put into effect . One uch measure ( not the only one ) would be to organize an adequate number of social agencies for the proper care of the children of employed others . At present many of these women do not know where to turn for help . It is only the fortunate woman who has an aging mother or other-in-law with whom the child may be left . Others are obliged to eave the infant with a neighbor , whom they pay for a service often inefficiently performed . Still others rely on the older children , out of hool hours , for the essential care , or on an unemployed husband . A few are forced to leave the baby with its food tied round its neck ? and hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backwardness of society in ameliorating the conditions which it creates . Humane feeling exists everywhere , but organized and effective social aid lags behind . The employment of mothers up to the time of confinement is generally bellieved to be a harmful practice . The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has on its statute books a law prohibiting the employment of a woman knowingly " within two weeks before or four weeks after childbirth . uch laws are hard to enforce unless a matron is appointed in each factory to see that the provisions are complied with . In England , where no rohibition exists regarding employment before confinement , Dr. Ashby has given attention to the question of the effect upon the offspring of the mother 's employment up to the day of confinement , especially where she works hard " and has only the bare necessaries in the way of food . " He nclk that such conditions affect the weight of the child adversely . Of 500 18o PROBLEMS OF THE FAMILY babies whose mothers worked up to the day of their birth , the average weight at birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten days in a pre-maternity home , the average weight was 3,290 grams . Of 500 infants whose mothers spent more than ten days in the home , the average weight was 3,366 grams.27 Influence of the Father 's Earnings . Reference has previously been made to the fact that the extradomestic employment of mothers is by no means the only cause of high infant mortality rates . Obviously the social phenomenon of breadwinning mothers is clearly related to that of low-paid fathers . An interesting and suggestive graph is produced in the Manchester report on infant mortality which shows conclusively that the employment of mothers fell sharply as the wages of the fathers rose . When the fathers were earning less than $450 a year , then nearly 75 per cent of the mothers were forced into gainful employment . And there were 225 such cases in the selected families studied ! When the men 's wages had risen to from $540 to $649 , the percentage of mothers employed had sunk to fifty-five . In the group in which the fathers were earning $1,050 and over , only 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells its own tale.28 In New Bedford conditions were very similar . A father 's wage below $450 meant that over 60 per cent of the wives and mothers entered gainful occupations . When the husband 's earnings had mounted to $650 , the percentage of mothers employed was cut almost in half . In the more adequately paid group , in which the father 's wages were $1,050 or over , only slightly more than 15 per cent of mothers were gainfully employed . ' " Grim and conclusive is the evidence as to the close correlation between a high infant mortality rate and low wages earned by fathers . In Manchester , when the wages of 225 fathers fell below S450 , the infant mortality rate rose to the appalling figure of 242.9 ? almost one infant death to every four births ! When the relatively high wage-group $850 t $1,049 is reached , the death rate of babies has fallen to 125 ? only slightly over half the first figure . In the highest wage-group of $1,250 over , the infant mortality rate has dropped to the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen births.30 New Bedford shows mu // the same conditions ? an infant mortality rate of 201.9 when the father earns less than $450 , and a rate of 59.9 when his earnings reach $1,250 or over.31 In the lowest earning group one live-born baby in every five ( lied before reaching its first birthday . The low earnings of fathers react unfavorably upon the infant death rate in at least two ways : they are chiefly responsible for the high percentage of employed mothers , unable to give their infants proper care or breast feeding ; and also they are responsible for the had housing conditions and overcrowding that are the inevitable accompaniments of poverty . Again , the densest ignorance of the principles of child care and feeding is most commonly found in the lowest wage-groups ; and the foreign-born mothers in this group , being often illiterate and unable to speak or understand English , can profit least by the printed pamphlets issued by boards of health and by the instructions of public health nurses . In Manchester , with its very high infant mortality rate in 1912 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exclusive of French connections , was 94.6 . In the case of illiterate mothers the rate rose to 198.8 . " Poverty nullifies in part the advantages of breast feeding , " says the Manchester report , " while an ample income mitigates the disadvantages of artificial feeding . The reason for this may be , as before noted , that poverty usually means low standards and ignorance on the part of the other , while ample income makes possible the attainment of higher tandards , better medical attention , and greater knowledge in the care of e baby . " 32 So-called " immaturity " or inability to meet the demands of bare hysical existence , is responsible for a large number of infant deaths wring the first month of life . There is good reason to believe that this condition is largely due to the malnutrition and overwork of the mothers in the poorer class ? whether they are employed outside the home or not . r . Ashby , a well-known English authority on this subject , declares : My own experience in the out-patient room entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important bearing on the nutrition 1 the foetus , and that the statement that the percentage of unhealthy births among the poor is small is not justified by facts . We constantly see fully veloped infants a day or two old . . . clearly ill-fitted , as the event proves , withstand the conditions of external existence . . . . There is no question I // of syphilis ; they are the children of poor mothers who have lived hard lives of wear and tear during pregnancy , are themselves badly nourished and weakly , and have felt the pinch of poverty , though often perhaps poverty of the secondary sort.33 It would seem from the above discussion that any impartial attempt to appraise justly the influence of the extra-domestic employment of mothers upon infant mortality must give due attention to factors , often lightly passed over , which are not the consequence of the gainful work of mothers , but of an economic situation that is characterized by the prevalence of low wages . Still-births , Abortions , and Miscarriages . Apparently not much is known of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of still-births . Of 2,662 births in New Bedford , seventy-five were still-births , giving a still-birth rate of 2.8 per cent of total births . It is noteworthy that , in New Bedford , the percentage of still-births in the group of non-employed mothers was 3.5 , as compared with a percentage of 2 among gainfully employed women . In Manchester , on the contrary , the percentage of still-births was 5.5 among gainfully employed mothers , and only 4.1 among the group not so employed . The percentage was highest among the wage-earning mothers working away from home , where it rose to 7.5-a rate of seventy-five per thou . sand . Whether the number of miscarriages among wage-earning mothers is higher than among those not gainfully employed is not apparent from a study of the reports . Abortions are far from uncommon among bread winning mothers , who know full well that each new baby means ilness loss of work and wages , and one more mouth to feed . Anthony repor that among the 370 wage-earning mothers included in her investigation " abortions are common and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of doctors and midwives carry on an illicit business in the district . A practice which the woman know to be so common they can scarcely regard as immoral ; and , in a case , they feel that it is justified by their necessities . " 34 From England 5. // come similar reports concerning gainfully employed mothers . In the anonymous " Introduction " to a volume of Maternity Letters from Working Women , the writer says : There are many facts which go to prove that the habit of taking ... drugs to procure abortion has spread to an alarming extent in many places among working women . Several of these letters confirm that conclusion . The practice is ruinous to the health of women , is more often than not useless for procuring the object desired , and probably accounts for the fact that many children are weakly and diseased from birth . But here again the cause of the evil lies in the conditions which produce it . Where maternity is only followed by an addition to the daily life of suffering , want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the most dangerous , uncertain , and disastrous methods of avoiding it.35 Persons who are opposed to birth control on moral grounds should be brought face to face with this situation and squarely confronted with this question : Which is more immoral , to prevent conception by scientific methods , or to take the life of an unborn infant at grave risk to its mother 's life and health ? No working mother in her senses , who is striving with all her strength feed and clothe a family already numbering three or four children , metimes more , can possibly desire an addition to her family so long these conditions exist . Therefore , when the children of these women e , the mothers do not grieve long . The mortality rate among the children of the poor is notoriously high . Anthony states that to the 370 gainly employed mothers whom her committee personally investigated , 58 children had been born . Of these , 437 had died ? almost 25 per t ! " They are strangely apathetic toward the loss of their children by th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first pang of sorrow is past , the caved mother is ready to say that the little one is better off ' and to ak of death as a merciful release from a life of hardships . One never bears from them the mourning cry of the mother in happier circumstances , So much love and pain and all for nothing . ' " 3G Nor should we surprised and repelled at this situation . It is well known that grinding poverty and a bitter daily struggle for mere existence blunt the finer ibilities . These same mothers , who mourn their dead offspring so " It // briefly , will work long hours to keep up a home for their children , and will show real heroism in the fight against poverty . Effects of Extra-domestic Employment of Married Women on Home and Child Care . There is a widespread conviction that the homes and children of wage-earning mothers suffer from neglect , and there is some evidence to support this theory . Obviously a woman employed nine hours a day in a factory , or shaking clothes in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-ordered home and give intelligent care and oversight to her children . Yet it is surprising to read the accounts of social investigators concerning the decent home conditions they found among breadwinning women . Although the small flats or multiple houses in which many of these women live are cramped and lacking in conveniences , they are by no means always dirty . Wage-earning women will come home , tired out from a heavy day 's work , and , after eating and resting a little , will start in washing the day 's accumulation of dishes , sweeping , or doing the family wash . Anthony says that the women she investigated usually spend three or four evenings in the week washing and ironing . One mother of two spotless little girls , on being asked how she managed to do it , replied , " I wash and iron every day . " Hard as this labor is , it is not so discouraging in its results as is the struggle to keep the home in order . The flats occupied by the poorer working class in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting-room , a combination kitchen and dining-room and one or two bedrooms . Closets do not exist , and clothing must be hung on hooks in the walls or thrown over chair-backs , unless the mother is fortunate enough to own a wardrobe and a bureau . The kitchen has no space for storage other than a shallow cupboard , thus necessitating the purchase of food from day to day . The space under the stationary tubs quite often is utilized to store the kindlings that children have dragged home from warehouses and stores . in the form of packing boxes , and have chopped up on the sidewalk . The family 's entire stock of coal is kept in a box or sack in the kitchen " Housekeeping in these cramped quarters is exceedingly difficult , ' writes Anthony . " Such a home absorbs an endless amount of labor wit out making much return in the way of tidy appearance ; the housekeep can overcome the dirt more easily than the disorder . It looks as if the // place was upside down , ' they would sometimes say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently little cooking and sewing are done in these homes . There is no time . The breadwinning mother soon learns the entire stock of canned foods at her disposal in the neighboring grocery stores . Anthony found " only occasional survivals of old-fashioned methods of preparing food . . . " among her 370 employed mothers . Not only are these methods time-consuming , but they use up precious fuel . Theorists are not lacking who maintain that the wage-earning mother expends and wastes more than she earns by not staying at home and looking thriftily to its management . But there is some evidence opposed to this view . In 1910 , Rose Otto made a thorough inquiry into this question with reference to the factory-working married woman in Munich , Germany . Her conclusion was that without the wife 's wage the family 's necessities could not be met . " The size of the deficits , " she declares , " disproved the assertion that the women could accomplish as much by thrifty housekeeping as by increasing the family income with their own earnings . On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Very interesting are Miss Otto 's statements that " the domestic arrangements of families with mothers at work did not differ materially from those where the mother was not employed . Lowering the cost of food in families without a maternal wage-earner was only accomplished by lowering the quantity of food without making up the loss by the substitution of more nutritious slues . Contrary to the general assumption that the women who do not ork secure with the same expenditure a relatively better nourishment , was shown that the same kind and amount of foodstuffs were used in other types of families . . . .7D 38 The causes for this similarity in housekeeping methods are not far to seek . As Miss Otto points out , the question uppermost in the minds of th the factory-working mother and the woman who spends a day at the mily wash-tubs is the same : " What costs the least ? " Of course a lack f t raining in household management and ignorance of food values is as true of the unemployed as of the gainfully employed mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has to spend . Certainly , I // this careful German study suggests that further comparative studies of the differences in the home conditions and daily diet in households where mothers are wage-earners and in those where they remain at home are greatly needed before any sweeping statements can be made concerning the quality of housekeeping in each group . But if there be room for opposing opinions regarding the question of home management among employed and unemployed mothers , there can , it would seem , be none about child care . Even when a mother is busy at the stove or ironing-board , she can leave these tasks to perform essential services for a helpless baby or a toddling mite . Not so the mother working for wages away from home . She must leave the house early in the morning and perhaps not return to it until her day 's work is done . At best she has but an hour at noon . The day nurseries are at present quite inadequate in number to meet the need , and are often far distant from the working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below school age , only forty were placed in day nurseries . The others shifted for themselves at home . Indeed , only two day nurseries were established in this entire west side district in New York extending from Thirty-Fourth Street north to Fifty-Fourth , and from Eighth Avenue west to Eleventh . These two nurseries could accommodate only 120 children . Probably the small fee usually charged proved prohibitive for some mothers ; and no doubt there was a certain amount of ignorant distrust of nursery methods of feeding and bathing . Then , too , the managing personnel of these nurseries , as the writer has more than once observed , are not always tactful and willing to show due regard for the views of mothers . What happens to the hundreds of babies left at home when mothers start for the day 's work ? As we have seen , some receive intermittent care from sisters or brothers in school ; some are left with a neighbor who takes charge of several at once ; occasionally the father , out of employment or engaged only in night work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these mothers manage , and surely not only at the expense of the babies , but at the cost of wearing anxiety on the part of women during their hours of absence . The Health of the Wage-Earning Mother . Whether the health of the wage-earning women in low-paid employments is markedly worse than among their sisters who stay at home , but // also struggle to make both ends meet , is not known . It would seem reasonable to infer that , if the first group carries two heavy jobs instead of one , this double burden must be borne at a physical cost more or less serious , depending upon the physique of the worker . After hours of scrubbing in private homes or public buildings , or after a long day in a laundry or factory , these women , who rose very early to get breakfast , care for the baby , and prepare the older children for school , often come home in a pitiful condition of fatigue . Among the reports of social investigations we read accounts of the " shocking state of exhaustion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach home , when they have been working overtime , as they quite often do . And there are no hours of leisure for these women before bedtime and the next day 's work . A score of neglected household tasks cry out for their attention , even when the older children assume their share of the work . This continuous grind of toil must surely have its reaction upon the health of overburdened mothers . Katherine Anthony found hernia and varicose veins common among them , and could not estimate how much they suffered from bad teeth and aching feet . Certainly many of them were almost toothless before the age of fifty . Owing to the small income on which the family must be supported , most of these mothers neglect their health until they are really ill . Then , too , continuous pregnancies and confinements in the thoroughly unsanitary conditions that prevail in many homes of the poor working class do much to sap the health of many breadwinning mothers . Of 386 women who wrote the Maternity Letters Previously referred to , 348 had had 1,396 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average of almost five pregnancies per other ! One woman had had eleven children and two miscarriages in wenty years ; another had had five children and one miscarriage in nine years ; still another had had five children and five miscarriages in twelve and one-half years . These are conditions that would undermine the health of the most vigorous human beings . Social Responsibility . Perhaps the above discussion has served to make plain that the extradomstic work of wage-earning mothers is a grave social problem . Its roots lie deep in economic and social conditions that force the mother from the home to swell the ranks of the untrained wage-earners . Society provides neither her husband nor herself with a living wage ; nor does it r I // give either one the training that would enable him or her to enter the more adequately paid ranks of skilled labor . Through the entire duration of their married life , these couples are engaged in an arduous struggle to keep a home and to drive the wolf from the door . Probably the vast majority of these employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ironing in laundries and in private homes , if they were assured of an income adequate to support their families . Although there is much evidence to show that child mortality is higher among gainfully employed mothers than among those not working away from home , it has not yet been clearly demonstrated that this evil is inseparable from the gainful employment of mothers . Rather does it appear that a considerable part of this high mortality among babies under one year could be prevented by ( 1 ) laws forbidding the return of mothers to work after childbirth for a considerably longer period than four weeks ; ( 2 ) by enacting legislation providing maternity insurance and nursing benefits for mothers ; ( 3 ) by public provision of neighborhood or factory nurseries , adequate in number and equipment to furnish excellent care to the babies ( and children under school age ) of employed women ; ( 4 ) by a further extension of maternity centers , hospital facilities for expectant mothers whose cases are difficult , and visiting nurse services . It should not be forgotten that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gainful occupations are also high ? in a few cases higher than among employed mothers ? due , no doubt , to ignorance and poverty . If to the services just mentioned were added abundant provision of cheap , municipal laundries and of kitchens where hot , cooked food could be purchased and taken home in suitable containers , two of a working mother 's gravest difficulties would be overcome . But these aids to workers found in a truly socialized society have been meagerly provided , if at all , under our present competitive and individualistic system . A modern writer attributes the difficulties under which the working mother labors partly to the fact that we insist on maintaining the presentday home just as it was carried on in the past under different economic and social conditions . Other institutions have changed their modes of operation ; not so the family , which is notoriously inefficient . She holds that the most destructive factor in the present family situation , the factor most responsible for retarding the establishment of adequate day // nurseries , cooperative dining halls and laundries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . is an economic system that does not provide a decent living for the majority of wage-earning families even after both mother and father have done their utmost to make it do so . A more adequate income would make possible the inauguration of a new type of division of labor , whereby welltrained individuals might as a vocation do most of the work that is now done in the home , in a manner that would leave mother , father , and children free to spend their leisure hours together free from the harassing details of homemaking ? which no woman does except from a sense of duty after a long day in the factory.39 Many socially minded men and women regard the employment of mothers as harmful chiefly because their children are left to look out for themselves , to run the streets after school hours , to form gangs , and in time to become delinquent . These consequences undoubtedly do follow in not a few instances . But the absence of the mother from her home is , apparently , not the only factor causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the mother is not engaged in gainful work . Here , again , intelligent social action is necessary in the provision of a sufficient number of well-equipped , well-staffed playgrounds , where the boys and girls of working parents may be drawn into organized games and sports after school hours . The very able Park Commissioner of New York , Robert Moses , is at present probably doing more to draw children from the streets and prevent delinquency by opening up scores f well-planned playgrounds than any other citizen of this vast metropolis . To the playgrounds should be added clubs , socially maintained , here children may develop worthwhile hobbies and new interests . Women 's Work in a Changing Economic Order . There is another aspect of this many-sided question which should not ignored . If complicated automatic machines continue to be invented the same rate as in the past fifteen years , throwing men and women t of work , the time may soon be upon us when work , not leisure , will ome a luxury . In such a situation it is possible that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand than that of men // and these women would return to the work of the home . Another solution of the dilemma created by automatic machinery and the displacement of workers might be the employment of both men and women at greatly reduced hours of labor . In either case the primary requisites of a humane society are ( 1 ) provision of enough work at wages sufficient to enable men , or men and women , to support their families in decent comfort and with a sense of economic security ; and ( 2 ) education of all human beings in the fruitful use of the increased leisure that is surely coming . Whether our present capitalist system , whose essential reason for being is the making of profits , can solve the problem of keeping men and women employed , so that the standard of living of American families may not fall to the level of Oriental peasants , is a question which only the future can decide . CHAPTER X PUBLIC AID TO MOTHERS AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN THE MODERN TREND TOWARD PUBLIC AID FOR MOTHERS AMONG all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none is of more interest to the student of social institutions than the trend toward state aid of mothers and dependent children . Not only is it significant in itself , as representing a powerful means of family rehabilitation and improvement , but it marks a complete reversal of the age-old policy of society by which each family was left to struggle on by itself . Only when the home was actually broken up , or the parents were demonstrably unfit to rear their offspring , did the public authorities intervene to protect the children . Little by little during the nineteenth and the first quarter of the twentieth centuries , this public policy of " hands off " has been undermined by repeated acts of the state in behalf of dependent children . The compulsory education laws , the acts designed to protect children from industrial exploitation and cruelty as well as to secure for them proper nourishment and care and training from their parents , under penalty of their removal from the home , are , of course , merely so many instances of the direct intervention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were left wholly to the determination of parents . With the decline of the patriarchal family there has developed a social conviction that the state must assume further responsibilities for the well-being of helpless children , especially when it is apparent that the family is unable to meet those responsibilities . Needless to say , the ancient philosophy of laissez faire has by no means released its held upon the minds of men , despite these new ventures ; witness the recent outcry raised by intelligent citizens against the proposed Child Labe Amendment as an invasion of family rights . Nevertheless , the prese trend is in the direction of rendering increased public aid to family to hold them together and secure their more successful functioning . This tendency has received a powerful impetus from the fact t 192 // our present industrial order makes it exceedingly difficult for the large group of unskilled wage-earners to hold their families together . As we have seen , the labor of hundreds of thousands of mothers in factories , laundries , and office-buildings is necessary to enable the home to continue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent years , and the fact that many of these youthful law-breakers have been deprived of parental care and guidance all day , year in and year out , have been brought to public attention by the press and the published reports of trained social workers . Slowly the conviction has taken root that , in self-protection , if for no more humane reasons , the state must strive to secure for all children so far as possible the benefits of a mother 's nurture and training , even if that mother be only a moderately deserving and efficient person . This enhanced appreciation of the virtues of a good home has been accompanied by increasing dissatisfaction with public institutions as places for the up-bringing of children . For more than a decade physicians , educators and social workers have expressed more and more vigorously their criticisms of public homes for children as places which tend to adopt the lock-step procedure of reformatories and to crush the budding individuality of boys and girls . Indeed there is evidence that these institutions leave their ineffaceable mark upon children in w form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , the mortality rate among babies committed to institutions is otoriously high , suggesting that these newcomers into a troubled world are vitally in need of a mother 's affection and coddling . Other forces have been at work impelling modern states toward a policy of public aid to mothers and families . Among these may be noted the inadequacy of private agencies to meet the enormous social need . Although many philanthropic organizations in the United States were aligned solidly against the policy of State relief , when it was first discussed , yet their own inability to grapple with the situation could not be denied . It is gratifying to note that , in recent years , the opposition of private agencies to such measures of family relief as the various States of the Union have set up has disappeared . Another condition that has led governments to grant aid to mothers . the falling birth rate in well-nigh all civilized countries . In France , where the low birth rate has caused something like a panic among the official class , maternity benefits may be traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline and racial extinction . Similarly , the birth rate in other advanced countries has fallen at a rate sufficient to arouse general alarm , and statisticians and students of population problems in England and America have uttered repeated warnings to the public , pointing out the danger of a loss of national power and prestige if the birth rate continues to fall . It is probable that the publicity given to this subject has had an effect , more or less conscious , on the minds of legislators in both countries , disposing them more favorably to public measures designed to secure to the nation healthy , well-trained children . There is another aspect of this question that should not be overlooked . For years certain social writers have been asserting that if the family continues to be regarded by the state as an independent and selfsufficient unit , then the state has no right to demand large families , criticize small ones or , indeed , intervene at all to influence the size of families . Mr. H. G. Wells has vigorously presented this point of view : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one has any right to revile small families ; if it is a public service , then the parent is justified in looking to the State to recognize that service and offer some compensation for the worldly disadvantages it entails . He is justified in saying that while his unencumbered rival wins past him he is doing the State a most precious service in the world by rearing and educating a family , and that the State has become his debtor . ' Another factor that has influenced governments in granting aid to mothers is a more thoroughgoing realization of the economic importance of child conservation . Vital statistics and morbidity statistics alike have shed revealing rays upon the waste of human life and vigor for which the slums and the industrial system must share the responsibility . Gradually it is being driven home to the minds of lawmakers that if healthy children are an asset to the nation and to productive industry , those children must be assured of decent home life and the nurture and oversight of a mother . Instead of leaving parents to flounder on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition of family independence , one nation after another is taking measures to conserve the mother , the child , and home life such as would never have been contemplated a generation ago . // HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC AID TO MOTHERS It is well known to sociologists that the United States has been one of the most backward of civilized nations in enacting legislation designed to protect laborers against sickness , accident , unemployment , and old age . With respect to all these forms of social relief legislation , Europe has taken the lead in passing laws that are more comprehensive and nation-wide than those enacted in the United States previous to the passage of the Social Security Act in 1935 .. Likewise in the field of state aid to mothers , European countries have led the way . The strongly individualistic spirit of the pioneers who colonized America , and who hewed out their homes and settlements in the wilderness , lives on in the America of to-day . This temper has , of course , been fostered by the enormous natural wealth of the country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's wealth is concentrated in the hands of relatively few and the supply of free land is exhausted , conditions of family need are developing in the United States similar to those of older European nations . Germany was the pioneer nation to provide maternity aid on a naonal scale by including such relief in a compulsory sickness insurance t passed in 1883 . Austria followed her lead in 1888 , and at present most every European country has provided for some form of marnity insurance or maternity grants to assist working mothers at the me of childbirth . In 1912 Australia passed a Maternity Allowance act which will be considered later . In 1913 New Zealand took action providing a state system of widow 's pensions ; and in the same year France enacted a law providing public grants to mothers for a fixed nod before and after childbirth . ) In the United States , the first step and providing any kind of public aid to mothers was taken in the State of Missouri in 1911 . It took the form of public grants payable mothers with dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years mothers ' aid laws were enacted forty-four states of the Union , the District of Columbia , Alaska , H awaii . Much diversity exists in the systems of public aid granted to mothers // in most civilized nations . They range from national sickness insurance schemes , including maternity benefits , to grants made outright to mothers from state funds under legally prescribed conditions . A brief consideration of the systems in operation in certain leading countries will serve to make plain their extent , variety and importance . MOTHERS ' PENSIONS OR ALLOWANCES The countries in which allowances from public funds are granted to widows and certain other classes of mothers with dependent children are Great Britain , New Zealand , New South Wales , Victoria , Canada , Denmark , Switzerland , 3 Soviet Russia , and the United States . In all these lands , the mothers ' pension movement marks a reaction against the institutional care of dependent children and a healthy recognition of the fact that even a moderately good home , presided over by a decent and fairly efficient mother , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a public institution , where boys and girls are reared and trained en masse with scant attention to individual differences . Mothers ' Allowances in the United States . The origin of mothers ' pensions in the United States may be traced to the White House Conference called by President Roosevelt in 1909 to consider problems connected with dependent children . Out of this conference emerged the conviction , expressed as a fundamental postulate , that children should not be deprived of home care except for urgent and weighty reasons . However , it is interesting to note that the disapproval of public relief to the needy which then prevailed was revealed in the conclusion that aid to mothers who are caring for dependent children should be administered by private agencies . Two years later , in 1911 , the Missouri legislature made legal provision for the payment of public funds to mothers of dependent children . Because of a population limitation , the law at first applied only to Jackson County , in which Kansas City is situated ; but in the same year the State granted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of children 's guardians with authority " to board out children to their own mothers . " A storm of protest from the opponents of public relief // to mothers greeted this new departure in legislation . Fortunately this did not prevent the State of Illinois from taking similar State-wide action in the enactment of its " fund to parents act " in July , 1911 . This law ? the first in the country applying to an entire State ? contained the following provisions : If the parent or parents of such dependent or neglected child are poor and unable to properly care for the said child , but are otherwise proper guardians and it is for the welfare of such child to remain at home , the court may enter an order finding such facts and fixing the amount of money necessary to enable the parent or parents to properly care for such child , and thereupon it shall he the duty of the county board , through its county agent or otherwise , to pay to such parent or parents at such times as said order may designate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or neglected child until the further order of the court . ' The State of Colorado next fell into line , early in 1913 , with a " mothers ' compensation act " which was framed in harmony with the provisions of the Illinois law . By the end of 1913 , eighteen States had enacted mothers ' pension laws or aid-to-mothers laws . After 1913 the movement to grant public aid gained powerful headway in this country . By 1931 , forty-four States , together with Alaska and Hawaii , had enacted laws aiding mothers of dependent children from public funds . Only the southern commonwealths of South Carolina , Georgia , Alabama , and New Mexico had failed at that time to put such laws on their statute books . ' Needless to say , this legislation has not been enacted without weighty pposition . It was urged that mothers ' pensions would pauperize the families receiving them ; that the law represented the inauguration of vicious policy of State paternalism ; that money should not be given needy persons to spend in their own homes , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for relief would have to established which would duplicate the work of private relief ncies and conflict with it ; that no proper supervision could be inuted over the ways in which the State 's money was spent by private ividuals . Happily , most of this opposition has ceased , and those who most deeply concerned in the successful operation of the laws are // at present bending every effort to their improvement by means of carefully framed amendments . The earlier name " widows ' pensions , " applied to this form of public aid to mothers , is already becoming obsolete in theory if not in usage . In a pamphlet concerning pension laws issued by the Children 's Bureau in 1924 this statement is significant : The emphasis is being placed on providing home care for children , with a constantly broadening inclusion of the classes of children for whom grants for this purpose may be made . Aid is being administered , not as a " pension " but in accordance with the methods of social case work , including thorough investigation of the needs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental condition of each member of the family , and such assistance as will promote the welfare of each child receiving this form of public aid . Owing to the experimental nature of the greater part of the early legislation outlined above , many of the State laws have been drastically revised since 1913 . Most of these amendments have aimed to make the law more inclusive in its application , to improve its administration and to increase the State appropriations available for the payment of grants-in-aid . The pioneer laws tended to restrict public aid to widows with dependent children , thus denying relief to deserted mothers , or to those with incapacitated husbands . Little by little , public opinion has undergone a " sea-change " with respect to this policy , and in 1931 only two States limited the grant to widows . Nevertheless , in that year 82 per cent of the mothers receiving aid were widows . In ten States and the District of Columbia aid may be granted to any needy mother or to any mother with dependent children , and in ten other States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all dependent families in which the father is dead , deserting , divorced , physically or mentally incapacitated , or imprisoned . In the remaining twenty-three States aid may be granted to widows and to certain other restricted groups of mothers . In fifteen of these States deserted mothers may receive aid , but in only one ( Texas ) may divorced mothers be assisted . Mothers whose husbands are imprisoned may receive assistance in seventeen of the twenty-three States , and in all of these aid is available to mothers whose husbands are physically or mentally incapacitated . It is interesting to note that unmarried mothers are specifically made eligible for aid in the states of Michigan , // Nebraska , and Tennessee . In 1931 there were fifty-five unmarried mothers receiving aid . Also , expectant mothers in need are eligible for assistance under the laws of seven States . In eighteen States and the District of Columbia the laws expressly provide that aid may be granted to a person other than the mother who stands in place of a parent , but in a few States the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States fathers are included in the persons eligible for aid . With regard to the age at which grants to children cease , some variety prevails . In all of the forty-four States except Kansas and Oklahoma children may receive assistance until they are legally exempt from school attendance . As many States have raised the age of compulsory school attendance , this means that large numbers of children are receiving grants up to the age of sixteen . Only four States provide that aid must stop at fourteen years of age and only four other States cease making grants when the child is fifteen . Respecting the amount of grant permitted by law , great variations prevailed in 1931 . The most enlightened theory holds that the grant should not be fixed by statute but by an administrative agency in acordance with family needs and resources . Eleven States and the Disict of Columbia have recognized this improved method by providing at it shall be left to the discretion of the administrative agency to ecide the amount necessary to maintain a child or children properly their own homes with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of aid shall not exceed the cost of institutional care . The remaining thirty-three States specify the maximum amount ? weekly or monthly ? that may be granted for the first child ( I for each succeeding child . In no State in 1931 did the maximum exceed $75 and in some of the poorer States it fell as low as $40 . Naturally the size of the monthly allowance granted to a family will be influenced by the number of children eligible for aid , any other contributions to the family income usually in the form of earnings of family members , and the limitations on grants imposed by law . The average monthly grants per family 6 in 1931 showed a great range , from $69.31 in Massachusetts to $4.33 in Arkansas . Commenting on the meager amounts paid for mothers ' aid in some states , the report of the Children 's Bureau for 1931 states that these small average grants would seem to indicate that in some local administrative units mothers ' Celt ulated on expenditures for grants during the month of June , 1931. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pittance to keep the family alive rather than as a means of maintaining family life . . . .7 Although , during the past decade , scores of thousands of mothers with dependent children have been assisted by the State to keep their homes together and give personal care and training to their children , much remains to be done before the relief granted these mothers is adequate either in amount or in kind . The recommendations made by a special committee on mothers ' pensions in the Proceedings of the Conference on Mothers ' Pensions held in Providence , Rhode Island , June 28 , 1922 , illumine the deficiencies that still exist , not only in the administration of aid to mothers , but in the provisions of the laws granting that aid . The committee urgently recommended first , that " mothers ' pension agencies make it their policy to grant aid sufficient to meet the deficit in the family budget , so far as the maximum grant under the law permits . " Clearly if the mother is not to work regularly in outside employment she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to remain at home at least four days a week and rear her family with proper attention to their physical well-being and moral training . To this end , the committee might well have added a corollary to the first recommendation , urging that mothers ' pension agencies bend every effort to secure such changes in the various state laws as will make possible the payment of allowances sufficient to meet essential needs . The committee 's second recommendation was to the effect that a budget should be made out for each family receiving aid , which should be based on a standard budget schedule as well as on the mother 's estimate of family requirements . Such a budget should include housing , food , fuel and light , household supplies , health and incidentals . The latter item comprised recreation , education , emergencies , car-fare , insuranc and spending money . A system of granting aid to mothers which take . careful account of actual , reasonable family needs , as determined by standard budget schedule subject to revision from time to time , woul seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of family allotments . Any other method is haphazard , undi criminating , and probably inadequate in the relief it affords . Third , the committee recommended that " all mothers ' pension age cies require at intervals itemized household expense accounts from fat // ilies receiving assistance . " This appears to be a thoroughly reasonable requirement , and might well prove to be a valuable means of educating mothers in economical and businesslike administration of the household , as well as of revealing the inadequacy of the family allowance . Fourth , the committee recommended that literature on health , food values , menus , school lunches and the like , such as are issued by the United States Bureau of Education , the extension departments of the State colleges and other organizations , be distributed by mothers ' pension agencies directly or through other sources . The fifth recommendation was to the effect that " some form of State supervision be adopted in those States not yet having it , for the accomplishment of effective administration of the mothers ' pension laws .

Federal Aid to Families : The Social Security Act . One of the significant and far-reaching effects of the economic depression of the years 1929 ? 1936 in the United States is the growing tendency of localities and states to look to the federal overnment for asistance in carrying their heavy burden of public and family relief . Many localities have become bankrupt during these last grim years and not a few States have reached the verge of the abyss . Under the ss of widespread poverty and unemployment , closed factories and krupt banks , public opinion in America has veered from a sturdy let in laissez faire government to the theory that the federal authority should assume responsibility for assisting local units of governt in feeding and employing their idle millions and in holding homes ther . Sympathetic with this theory , the Roosevelt administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 in nation 's history ? an act which sounds the knell of the old " let e " philosophy of government that the United States inherited from trrnth-century Europe . An important section of the act provides for Aid to Dependent ChilTprw ? d by both Houses of Congress and approved by the President August 14 , // dren ( Mothers ' Aid ) by means of federal grants . A Social Security Board is set up to administer these grants to such States as submit to the Board satisfactory , State-wide , mandatory plans for aid to dependent children . An initial appropriation of $24,750,000 was authorized by the act to be allotted to those States whose plans proved acceptable to the Board , on condition that the States met two thirds of the expense of mothers ' aid . The federal grant would meet one third of the cost ; but payments in excess of $18 monthly for the first child and $12 monthly for each succeeding child would not be matched by the Board . This means that a family of three dependent children will be aided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not exceed the niggardly sum of forty-two dollars . Any financial grant beyond that amount must be met by the State or the local unit . It seems reasonable to infer that one of the first effects of the participation of the national government in aid to dependent children may be a cutting down of State grants . The conditions of federal aid prescribed in the act are that grants shall be made in behalf of a needy dependent child or children under sixteen by reason of the death , absence , or incapacity of a parent . Payments may be made to the responsible parent or to " an enumerated relative in a residence maintained as a home . " The act specifically provides that the State residence requirement must not disqualify a child who has resided in the State for a year preceding application or who was born in the State in the preceding year if the mother has resided in the State one year preceding the birth of the child . In March , 1936 , twenty-four states and Hawaii were receiving federal grants . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are meager indeed , it must not be overlooked that the pars mount significance of the Social Security Act lies in the abandonment by the federal government of the political philosophy of laissez fair individualism in accordance with which families in direst need an distress were let alone to struggle on by themselves or with the uncertain aid of charitable societies . For better or worse the nation has no assumed responsibility for its dependent and needy children . Mothers ' Pensions in Foreign Countries . Only a brief sketch can be given of the laws of certain foreign cou tries providing for mothers ' pensions or allowances from public funds // Although there is no legislation in Canada covering the whole Dominion , seven provinces have taken separate action . Manitoba led the way in 1916 and was followed by Saskatchewan and Alberta in 1917 and 1919 respectively . In 1930 mothers ' allowance legislation was in operation in five provinces and acts were passed that year in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick . As in the United States needy widows are eligible to receive aid in all seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desertion qualifies the mother to receive aid in only a few . Only in British Columbia are unmarried mothers and divorced wives 9 admitted to assistance . The cost of the allowances is carried entirely by the provincial treasury in British Columbia , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and Saskatchewan ; in Alberta , Manitoba , and Ontario one half the expense is met by provincial funds and one half by municipal . The funds are administered by an official appointed by the provincial authorities . Grants are made separately in behalf of the m other and of each dependent child under fifteen or sixteen . On the hole the allowances are more generous than in many States of the American Union . For example , in British Columbia the maximum allowance per month is $42.50 for the mother and her first child , with 7.50 monthly for each additional child . In Nova Scotia the maximum that may be paid any family is $60 a month ; in Ontario the maximum in all cases is $80 per month.New Zealand enacted the New Zealand Pensions Act in 1913 , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This later act of 13 applies to old-age and military pensions as well as widows ' pens , bringing them all under the administration of one department . er this law , public aid is granted to widows ( not to mothers with pacitated husbands ) who have dependent children under the age fourteen . Applications must be made to the registrars of pensions a hearing before a magistrate must precede the grant or refusal of lc aid . The law provides that the magistrate must be satisfied that widow " is of sober habits and of good moral character , and that pension will be properly used for the support of her children . " For child , the amount payable as pension is twelve pounds a year ; for additional child , the pension is increased six pounds a year . But amounts are " subject to a deduction of one pound for every pound Whit the annual income of the widow and her children . . . after // deducting personal earnings to an amount not exceeding one hundred pounds , exceeds the sum of thirty pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand law contains two of the defects found in certain of our own State laws : ( 1 ) the pension is restricted to widows , thus denying any aid from public funds to worthy mothers of dependent children who have been deserted , or who are struggling to maintain a home after their husbands have become physically or mentally incapacitated ; ( 2 ) a fixed amount is paid for each child , making it impossible for the amount of the pension to be adapted to the needs of the family . Obviously the grants made under the New Zealand law are quite inadequate . Sixty dollars a year ( ? 12 ) for the first child , and thirty dollars additional for each other child , would amount , in the case of a family with three children under fourteen , to approximately $120 a year ? a sum too small to support even one child in decent comfort . The Danish law , enacted in 1913 and effective January 1 , 1914 , provides that widows " who are considered indigent shall , provided they are entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to a public contribution toward the support and education of their legitimate children or children adopted under marriage , without the disabilities attaching to poor relief . " Indigency is defined as a condition in which the widow 's property does not exceed 4,000 kr. ( $1,072 ) , with the addition of 500 kr. for each child under fourteen years . Moreover , the income of the widow must not exceed the amount exempt from State taxation in the commune concerned . The allowance provided by the original law was 100 kr. ( $26.80 ) 11 yearly until the child was two years old ; 80 kr. ( $21.44 ) yearly until the child was twelve years ; 60 kr. ( $16.08 ) yearly until the child reached the age of fourteen . Under certain circumstances the allowances may now be continued up - to eighteen years . These amounts were materially increased during the lean years of 1918 and 1919 , but have been at all times quite inadequate . Because of this fact , many widows have been forced to refuse the grants and seek relief from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1915 , permitted widows to supplement their meage allowances by applying for aid from the poor-relief funds ? thus defea // ing the essential purpose of the Widows ' Pension Law , namely , to make grants to widows from public funds which should bear no stigma of poor-relief . In March , 1920 , the law was amended and the allowances were increased to 200 kr. during the first four years of life , 160 kr. until the twelfth year and 120 kr. thereafter . The cost of the allowances is divided equally between the state and the commune concerned . When the widow receives poor relief or assistance from municipal auxiliary funds , the present law expressly provides that the public grants will cease . In 1931 the number of widows assisted was 7,542 and these mothers had 14,836 dependent children.12 Switzerland has only very recently provided pensions for needy widowed mothers . By a federal decree of March 9 , 1934 , which went into effect six days later , the sum of one million francs from the federal treasury 13 is to be distributed among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-five and to orphans under eighteen . The mothers must be Swiss citizens with an income insufficient for their own support and that of their dependent children . The decree emphasized the importance of careful investigation of every case and of keepg mother and child together . Each canton is left free to arrange devils of distribution of pensions , under the general supervision of the federal government , and each must make an annual report to the central authorities.l " Here , again , allowances for mothers are an outright theft of the government , not provided for in a system of social insurance . At various times the government of Soviet Russia has issued regulations on aid to unmarried or deserted mothers , or widows , all designed to keep mother and children together . By a decree of September 26 , 1927 , the People 's Commissariat of Public Health urged the importance of financial aid to such mothers to enable them to keep their children with them . This was a much-needed means of preventing juvenile vagrancy and delinquency ? a serious problem in Soviet Russia at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pensions for the family of a deceased breadwinner ? parent , brother or sister ? provided he or she was in a gainful occupation at the time of his death or disappear- // ante . Pensions are paid to children under sixteen ( or under eighteen if still attending school ) , to children who have lost their working capacity before the ages of sixteen or eighteen and to parents if incapacitated for work , or aged.15 The Widows , Orphans and Old Age Contributory Pensions Acts of Great Britain . In 1925 , the Conservative government of Great Britain enacted important legislation securing to widows ( or widowers ) with dependent children and to orphans the payment of weekly allowances . The pensions are , classified into contributory and non-contributory . Contributory pensions are payable to ( 1 ) the widow of a man insured under the National Health Insurance Act who had paid 104 contributions prior to his death after January 4 , 1926 , when the act went into effect ; ( 2 ) the children of an insured man ; ( 3 ) orphan children , i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an insured man or an insured woman . The word child is interpreted to include a stepchild or the illegitimate child of a man or his wife , who was living with him at the time of his death ; or the illegitimate child of an insured widow , who was living with her at the time of her death . Non-contributory pensions will be paid to widows , children , and to orphans of men or widows who die before the commencement of the act , but who would have been insured persons if the law had been in force . The amounts of pensions paid are ten shillings per week for widows , five shillings for the first child under fourteen , and three shillings for subsequent children , seven shillings sixpence for orphans or for children who are removed from the custody of their mother . In the case of children these allowances are paid only until the children are four ? teen and one half years of age , or up to sixteen years in cases whet the child is in full-time attendance at a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be required to contribute at th rate of ninepence for a man ( 4/ pence paid by the employer and 41 pence by the employee ) and 4/ pence for a woman ( 2/ pence paid by the employer and 2 pence by the employee ) . These rates includ payments toward old-age pensions after sixty-five years . No wido . // may receive a pension if she remarries or cohabits , nor will pensions be paid to persons in poor-law institutions , lunatic asylums , or prisons ( without the option of a fine ) . To the fund required to meet the expense of this national pension system , the government of Great Britain pays " in principle " the difference between expenditure and contribution income ; in particular it pays the entire cost of non-contributory pensions . The pensions are paid through the Post Office . Contributions by employers and employees are paid as under the Insurance Act , a stamp combining health and pension contribution being provided by the government to be attached to the necessary document . On December 31 , 1930 the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the total of child beneficiaries was 325,675 . The state subsidy for these pensions was ? 9,315,000 or about $46,500,000.16 An examination of this act reveals some interesting facts . All workgmen and women who are compelled to take out insurance under the ational Health Insurance Act are also compelled to be insured for widows ' , orphans ' , and old-age pensions , with the exception of a few empted persons who will not be required to contribute to the old-age lowance . Thus Great Britain is committed to the principle that all ge-earners , except the very poorest , should be required to cooperate th the government and the employer in providing for future continuencies such as are bound to arise when the chief provider of a family s leaving a widow and young children . It is a fair question whether h a system of contributory payments by workers is not a sounder than that in use in the United States , where the pension is a gift of State . The British method would , it seems , better insure the indedence and self-respect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British act does not discriminate against illegitimate children , thus taking an important step toward the righting of an ancient wrong the hardships wrought by the attitude and customs of Christian nations upon innocent children born out of wedlock . Finally , it should be noted that , by this national act , Great Britain has established a uniform widows ' and orphans ' pension system throughout England , Scot- // land , Wales , and Northern Ireland , whereas in the United States each commonwealth enacts its own separate laws , some of which are markedly inferior to those of the more progressive States . MATERNITY BENEFIT SYSTEMS IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES Long before the awful carnage of the World War had aroused the governments of Europe to the importance of conserving the lives of mothers and infants , Germany , Austria , and Hungary had developed maternity benefit systems.l ' The compulsory sickness insurance laws of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Denmark provided for maternity aid on a national scale between the years 1883 and 1892 . The early example of these European countries was followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1911 ; Russia , Sweden , and Rumania in 1912 ; France and the Netherlands in 1913 ; and Norway in 1919 . Since the close of the World War , most of the smaller European states have enacted some form of maternity benefit legislation . To these nations should be added the new-world countries of Australia , New Zealand , and the United States , which have provided forms of aid to mothers at childbirth differing markedly from the systems developed in Europe . Forms of Maternity Aid . A glance at the laws of the various nations that have provided stat wide systems of maternity benefits serves to reveal the bewilderin diversity that exists among them . However , it is possible to classify th systems under the following heads : ( 1 ) compulsory sickness insuranc including maternity insurance , to which employers , employees , an sometimes the state contribute ; ( 2 ) maternity insurance in connection with voluntary sickness insurance , subsidized and controlled by th state ; ( 3 ) compulsory maternity insurance in the absence of a nation sickness insurance system ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight grants to mothers from public funds ; ( 5 ) the pr vision to mothers of medical attendance , nursing service , and helps // advice during pregnancy and confinement furnished by voluntary or public organizations with or without subsidies from the state . The first two systems are by far the most general , being in operation in 1925 in twenty-five states of Europe . ' 8 The third method is restricted to Italy and Spain . The fourth system is established in Australia ; the fifth in New Zealand and the United States . Maternity Benefits in Connection with a National Insurance System . In those European countries that have adopted some form of national insurance against sickness , maternity benefits are included in this scheme . As we have seen , however , the insurance system may be compulsory or voluntary . Among the more important European countries that have made provision for compulsory sickness insurance , including maternity insurance , are Germany , Austria , Hungary , Great Britin , France , the Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Rumania , Jugo-Slavia , witzerland ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maternity insurance in connection with voluntary sickness inrance , subsidized and controlled by the state , prevails in Belgium , enmark , Finland , Sweden , and Switzerland ( in certain cantons ) . With pect to financing the scheme , two methods are in general use . ( 1 ) e income of the sickness and maternity insurance funds is derived holly from an assessment on wages , of which the employer and the employed pay fixed proportions , the state contributing nothing . Such the method in Austria , Germany , the Netherlands , and several other entries . ( 2 ) The insurance funds are obtained by contributions from employer , the employee , and the state . State grants or subsidies to inurance funds are made in Great Britain , Norway , Sweden , Denmark , it Switzerland , and Italy . The benefits enjoyed by those eligible to maternity aid under the insurance systems reveal considerable diversity . Those of Austria , Germany , Norway , Czechoslovakia , Luxemburg , Poland , and certain Swiss tons are , perhaps , most generous and comprehensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds provide for two or more e following forms of benefit : Medical benefit . This consists of free medical attendance and midservice , free medicines , and appliances . If the expectant mother 's 1 2io PROBLEMS OF THE FAMILY condition before confinement is not satisfactory , she may be given medical treatment and maintenance in a maternity hospital . In such cases a fixed proportion may be deducted from the daily cash benefit described below . 2 . Maternity benefit . Women who have paid sickness insurance for a stipulated length of time may receive , in addition to medical and nursing care , a cash benefit . In Germany 19 this consisted of a lump sum of ten Reichmarks ( about $4.00 ) and a further cash benefit of not less than half a Reichmark ( about 20 cents ) daily for four weeks before confinement and six weeks after it . In France , under the new Social Insurance Law which came into force on July 1 , 1930 , maternity benefit ( like sickness benefit ) consists of an allowance equal to half the basic wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confinement and six weeks after . 3 . Nursing benefit . In certain countries , as France , Germany , and Czechoslovakia , a nursing benefit is paid to every insured woman who remains at home for a stipulated period to nurse her child . The benefit allowance in Germany was in 1930 equal to half the maternity benefit ( not less than 0.25 Reichmarks or about ten cents ) daily , paid for twelve weeks . In France an insured woman who nurses her child is entitled to a monthly allowance of 150 francs ( about $9.75 ) for the first four months , 100 francs in the fifth and sixth months and fifty francs thereafter for not more than nine months.20 The maternity benefit in Great Britain is limited to the payment of a lump sum of ? 2 derived from the dues paid by an insured husband for at least forty-two weeks and an equal amount from dues paid in t the fund by the wife , if she herself is insured .
