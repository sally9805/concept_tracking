AYOUNG lady who feels the cold terribly has found a new use for cops . It happens that she lives on the second floor just over a dangerous intersection , so that always , night and day , there is a traffic policeman right under her window . The one on duty when she gets up in the morning is as delicately adjusted to the weather as a ship 's barometer , she says , and one glance at him is enough . If his nose is pink , it 's all right to wear her cloth coat ; if it 's blue , it 's the fur coat and the tippet . AS you certainly know by now , your new automobile licence plates will carry a line reading " New York World 's Fair 1939 . " We are against this , just as we are against having any-other kind of advertising matter on our car , whether it be diving girls in red bathing suits , or pennants celebrating Frank Buck 's monkey farm , or even the automobile dealer 's name on the jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for one thing , and for another , although we 're crazy about the Fair , we resent being compelled to carry sandwich hoards , front and rear , for the enterprising merchants and hotelmen who expect to make a profit out of the visitors . Nothing can be done about this situation legally . A lawyer we know was shocked at the very idea of painting out the line about the Fair , adding ominously that it was a misdemeanor to obscure any part of the plate and there was no telling what a judge would do if we got caught at it . Nevertheless , we 've just about decided that we are going to do something about it and let the law take its course . We 're not going to paint out the line about the Fair , though ; we 're just going to fasten a little strip of tin on top of it , and it 's going to read " Down with Grover Whalen ! " THE author of hardboiled novels may well look on the New Year ( and the economic necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer of this genre can produce no more perversion or violence ; his only hope lies in an extension of technique . As Vice grows more familiar and her face less dreadful , he must mention her more casually , noting her presence perfunctorily , in passing , like that of an old and rather tiresome friend . The Messrs . Hemingway and Cain have finished their current books and have no immediate need of our advice . Nothing , however , has been heard lately from Mr. Dashiell Hammett , and we take the liberty of offering him a sample first paragraph in line with these ideas : The girl in the blue dress was out in the kitchen , sharpening an axe . " Some dame ! " said Ed . " She 's all right , " 1 said , " if you do n't mind cannibals . " He nodded . " Listen , " he said , " you heard vet how the Yanks made out ? " THERE was some talk in the papers about the Robinsons being imprisoned in Russia as American spies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it impossible for us to think about an American spy . Other nations undoubtedly do have their secret agents , copying the plans of fortifications , chewing and swallowing them when cornered , but they are the products of national characteristics which could never be found in native American stock . British spies , for instance , are suave ; the Russians ( all women ) are exotic , the Japanese furtive , the Germans cunning , and so on . All these adjectives are derogatory , or at least they imply a talent for indirection and duplicity which must he hateful to the simple American heart . The keynote of our national character , as Mr. Goldwyn has shown us , is a sort of frank manliness , and a frank and manly spy is a contradiction in terms . We prefer to believe that the United States would infinitely rather lose a war than have one American boy worm his way improperly into the confidence of a prime minister 's wife , or one American girl sell her body for the plans of a battleship . 12EC 0 TERING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal gaiety , we would like to say that , in general , 1938 will he a year of unparalleled national confusion and private woe . It may even be that many clouds too long gathering , purple in the western sky , will burst in deluge  --  the year of cataclysm , the hour of the rat . We have no idea what shape disaster is likely to wear , whether it will he war or the final collapse of an implausible economic structure or simply the slow piling up of little burdens and anxieties until they are intolerable and the nation , as one man , marches down to the sea and drowns . The details are unimportant ; you can be very sure that the total will be unpleasant . Happy New Year , everybody ! ? INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE : Lindy 's Restaurant has on its sandwich list a G-Man Special , made of raw meat . Sign observed in front of a house on East Eleventh Street : " No dogs allowed , for any reason whatsoever . " On West Twenty-second Street there is a restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Aprilizing Corporation of America was not named for what you think , but for its founder , Mr. Abe April . Ferdinand ONE of the strangest chapters in the history of English literature is the story of young Munro Leaf , who wrote " The Story of Ferdinand , " a children 's hook which has in fifteen months sold 100,000 copies . We might explain for the benefit of the scattered few who have n't yet read " Ferdinand " that it 's a brief story ( with pictures ) about a bull named Ferdinand who likes to lie under a cork tree and smell flowers , and who absolutely refuses to be a party to a bullfight . Well , Ferdinand has provoked all sorts of adult after-dinner conversation . Some say he 's a rugged individualist , some say he 's a ruthless Fascist who wanted his own way and got it , others say the tale is a satire on sit-down strikes  --  you see the idea . When the Times printed an editorial about Ferdinand , we realized that it was time to look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Screwball " is Mr. Leaf 's word for the notion that his little tale has any social or political implications , and he ought to know if anybody does . He told us all about his background , how he came to be a writer , and how he came to write " Ferdinand . " The background includes the University of Maryland and Harvard , several years ' service as a preparatory-school instructor , and finally his present job with the publishing house of Frederick Stokes . He 's now thirty-two , married , and childless . " Ferdinand " was his fourth book for children . The preceding three ? " Grammar Can Be Fun , " " Robert Francis Weatherbee , " and " Manners Can Be Fun " ? were illustrated , in an untutored way , by the author himself . " Ferdinand , " however , was written to provide a scenario for the illustrations of Robert Lawson , who is pretty well known outside the juvenile field as an etcher . It took Mr. Leaf just forty minutes to write " Ferdinand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October , 1935 , without a trace of an idea for a plot . " But the minute I thought of a bull , I could see the whole story , " he told us . " He would n't do what he was expected to do . " The finished MS. , written in longhand , covered two sheets of typewriter paper . Mr. Leaf made one correction  --  in the next-to-the-last sentence changed the word " yet " to " still . " Sales of " Ferdinand " reached seven thousand this last Christmas week , running slightly behind Dale Carnegie and well ahead of Eleanor Roosevelt . Strange reverberations , entirely unconnected with the field of juvenile literature , continue to reach Mr. Leaf 's ears . An angry lady wrote to him from California berating him for snaking fun of Spain 's national sport in these trouhlous times , and from the same state came word that Santa Barbara was entering a fifty-foot Ferdinand in the Tournament of Roses parade .

Walt Disney is making a Silly Symphony of the story , thus opening to the Messrs . Leaf and Lawson ( who go fifty-fifty on the proceeds ) an attractive vista of royalties from Ferdinand  --  toys , pottery , clothes , and whatnot . Mr. Leaf is under contract to the Ladies ' Home Journal to write a children 's page . Meanwhile , " Noodle , " his fifth juvenile , published only three months ago , has already reached twenty-five thousand . What a career !

But what I do n't get , " said our cabdriver , turning around and looking at us earnestly , " what I do n't get is where the hell the guy ever picked up a crazy idea like that . " Consular Activity OUR favorite organization just now is the Society of Foreign Consuls in New York . It avows as its purpose the promotion of international friend-ship , which we favor , and its roster con-tains some of the nicest names we know of : Hon. Count Charles de Ferry de Fontnouvelle , of France ; Hon. Tsune-chi YU , of China ; Hon. Constantine Pop-Attanassoff , of Bulgaria ; and Hon. Jindrich Starch , of Czechoslovakia . It is one of the most exclusive fraternities in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . At all gatherings the members try to avoid speaking anything but English , and all international animosities are supposed to be thrown overboard . Without the so-ciety , the consuls feel , they would n't get to know each other at all , and they have quite a few things in common and are gregarious fellows by nature . Sir Har-ry Armstrong , the then British Consul General in New York , led in the forma-don of the society in 1925 . There is a volume of bylaws ( which does n't say much ) on file at the Public Library . Dues are $20 a year . The president now is the present British Consul Gen-eral , Sir Gerald Campbell . Each year there are several luncheons and dinners , and a couple of formal dances at the Ritz-Carl-ton . Until two years ago the luncheon and dinner meetings used to be held on the lin-er Majestic , but since the State Liquor Authority took to taxing liners for serving drinks on such occasions , these functions have been held ashore . The first meeting this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , and the Japanese Consul General , the Hon. K. Wakasugi , was n't present , although China was represented . We asked Sir Gerald flatly about this and he said he thought Mr. Wakasugi would have come if he had n't had a previous engagement . " He 's busy attending a lot of meetings right now , " Sir Gerald told us . The Spanish Consul was n't present either , and Sir Gerald said he had n't heard of his being around town lately and thought he might have gone away . One item of business at the meetings is usually discussion of opinions handed down by various American governmental departments clarifying or amplifying new legislation affecting nationals of other countries . Not infrequently one bureau will say one thing and another bureau something else , and the conflicting rulings have been known to keep the gathering in jovial good humor for forty minutes . The society has on occasion also functioned as a protective organization . One time a swindler took to calling up the consuls , saying he was an American naval officer just arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval officer , who had once been stationed in the consul 's country , had given him a package for delivery to the consul in New York ; the duty came to $20 , and would the consul kindly leave the amount with his secretary and give it to the boy who was arriving with the package ? When opened , the parcel was found to contain old newspapers and used sacking . The scheme worked with several of the consuls but got snarled up at the Swiss consulate , whose government is notoriously disregarded in naval matters . Mr. Victor Nef , the Swiss Consul , reported the matter at the next meeting , and that was the end of the scheme . Recipe AWISTFUL housewife was sitting in a plushy Madison Avenue employment agency , waiting to interview cooks and dreaming of that theoretically not impossible one who might achieve perfect souffles , when she saw on a table several new copies of a book called " The Swedish Princess 's Cook Book " ? put there , presumably , in the hope of making quick sales to ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf through the volume and the first recipe that caught her eye was one headed " Roast Saddle of Reindeer . " She hired the very first applicant , an Irish woman who said she was a good plain cook . Widgets HAVING read from time to time newspaper stories about the mystery of the disappearing widgets at the Stock Exchange , we decided last week to go down to Wall Street and find out for ourselves what it 's all about . Widgets are tiny wooden cylinders which carry orders and reports of sales through the Exchange 's pneumatic-tube system , and they have been disappearing at the rate of nine thousand a month . This is of no great moment financially , since widgets sell in hulk for $12 a thousand , but it 's eerie , and the Exchange people would like to know what 's going on . The most plausible theory is that brokers , receiving a message via widget , absent-mindedly stuff the widget into their pocket instead of returning it ; a broker who was n't particular about the set of his coat might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto his bureau top at night . Nobody knows for sure if that 's what happens , but it 's likely . There 's a lot more widget lore than you 'd believe possible . The name , for instance . " Widget " is a word that was coined by George Kaufman and Marc Connelly twelve or fourteen years ago in the play " Beggar on Horseback . " Somebody asked a prosperous manufacturer in the play what it was he manufactured , and the fellow replied , " Widgets . " When the pneumatic-tube system was installed at the Exchange in 1917 , the widgets were called " tube carriers . " It was a financial writer , in a rare sportive mood , who later gave them the nickname . The Stock Exchange librarian , Mrs. Meredith , investigated the word recently and found it in Weseen 's Dictionary of American Slang , published in 1934 ? " Widget : an indefinite substitute name for any appliance or device . " Or , as they now say at the Exchange , " A widget is a gadget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit sealed bids for orders to the Exchange 's Division of Supply . They come in three colors  --  natural maple , red , and blue ; the colors have no significance . They have to be breakable , or else when they got out of shape with wear they 'd clog up the pneumatic tubes . They travel on the main floor of the Exchange at an average speed of 15 M.P.H. Upstairs , in the ticker-operating room , they travel in vacuum tubes at 45 M.P.H. Once , during a trial run , a widget went 465 feet in 4.2 seconds-75 M.P.H. Since 1917 the Exchange has used up 30,000,000 widgets , which is almost one for every family in the United States . Uprising I the course of her Christmas shop- A ping last week , Miss Joan Crawford dropped into Dunhill 's . An attache in a snuff-colored tobacconist 's jacket took charge and led her to a counter in the rear of the shop , where he commanded an under-secretary to exhibit the platinum watches forgentlemen 's evening wear . Suddenly the door of the shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with natives screeching for autographs . The attache acted as England would expect any man to act under such circumstances . With the most frigid dignity he asked the intruders to step along , but the uprising was out of hand from the start and he was merely knocked aside . Still he clung to his diplomatic formula , repeating over and over through clenched teeth , in a sort of Reginald Gardiner rage , " Step along , please ! Step along , please . Step along ? please ! " A fan yelled at Miss Crawford , " Say , dearie , did n't you have to take off a lot of weight for ' The Bride Wore Red ' ? " The attache , purple now , and with his hair in his eyes , screamed back at the woman , " Of course she did n't ? " Fireside Films T " gruesome touch , lacking at so many hearthstones in the sleepy past , is now being provided for through the flourishing business of the miniature newsreel for the home . You need n't he content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift , appalling horror in Madrid ; if you are one of the million and a half people in the country with home movie projectors , you can ask in a few friends , gather the children around , and run off your own newsreel over and over , with the sound ( if you are equipped for it ) turned down to medium horrible . We learned of this new fireside fancy while investigating an advertisement of Magnin , 1944 Boston Road , New York City , which said , " Sino-Japanese War Pictures Uncensored . Gruesome Shanghai Bombing . Actual Uncensored War Pictures just Flown In . Stark ! Vivid ! Bombings , Panics , Waterfront Fires , etc . " It turned out that Mogull 's is only a retail outlet for these films and that the kingpin in the business is one Eugene W. Castle , former Gaumont cameraman , former Marine gunnery sergeant , the head of Castle Films , Inc. , with offices in Rockefeller Center . Mr. Castle is a vigorous man who talks at the top of his voice alI the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no trouble getting his story . For seventeen years he has been in special branches of the film industry -- educational films , pep films to make salesmen sell more of what they 're selling , advertising films . Last year he got the idea of newsreels for the living room , having in mind the vast number of home projection machines made necessary by the craze for amateur movies . It was then he started for the upper brackets . He got together with two newsreel companies and made arrangements to make prints from their films , in both 16- and 8-mm. sizes . He was busy at work on a reel of the Coronation when the Hindenburg burned in full view of a movie camera , and he had to zing into that and make it Release No 1 of " News Parade , the First Home Newsreels in History . " That sold like sixty and so did the Coronation when it came along a few weeks later , and there would n't have been any headache at all if he had n't followed up with a " Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's stuck with two million feet of it at the moment and bellows every time he thinks of it . " It 's a damn historical , interesting picture , " he says , " and people ought to buy it . " He thinks it would have gone if he 'd called it " Wally and David , " or maybe " The Romance of the Century , " We found Mr. Castle as surprised as we were over the home-circle interest in the hyper-gruesome , and learned that he deplored the lurid wording of the Mogull advertisement . He pointed out that he himself had censored the films , omitting the worst details because no home , especially with children in it , would want to show them . Mr. Castle told us that in addi tion to current news , he plans to release sports reels , travel films , and old-time movies ( such as the Fatty Arbuckle-Mabel Normand comedy , " Cast Adrift  --  and Why " ) , and also that all the home films afford great opportunities for jokes .

" Assembly Line nNLY one of the many ' twas-the ?  - -  / night-before-Christmas stories we heard this year seems worth printing . This is about a young father whose sons , aged four and six respectively , each asked Santa Claus for a fire engine , the kind you can get in and pedal . The Ere engines were ordered from one of the big department stores  --  we wo n't say which one  --  and arrived a few clays before Christmas in a big crate , which was put away unopened . Late Christmas Eve , when the boys were finally asleep , the father and his wife opened the crate and found not complete fire engines but envelopes full of nuts and bolts , and innumerable red-painted parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand . It was then one o'clock in the morning . This fellow used to be an aviator and , naturally , knows a good deal about machinery , but after two hours of struggling with the bolts and nuts and pieces of iron he had to admit defeat . Grimly , he put the whole mess in a clothes basket and set out , at three in the morning , to find somebody who could help him . A taxi-driver told him he thought there was an all-night toy place on upper Broadway . At 110th Street , sure enough , there was an open toy store , and . a clerk who knew how to assemble fire engines . The father got back downtown at four , with two assembled fire engines and a taxi fare of $4.45 . His sons did n't wake till almost five , so all was well . The store , when our man complained about the unassembled fire engines , was apologetic but firm in its refusal to refund the $4-.45 . However , in a rather disorganized gesture of good will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
