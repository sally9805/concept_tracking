txt Mr. Rogers Expresses Sympathy For Our College Boys and Girls To the Editor of the Neu ) Tork Times : BEVERLY HILLS , Cal. , Nov. 30.  - -  They got a gag in these colleges now where they slip up behind a boy or girl and say : " What are you going to major in ? " " Oh , Professor , I am not going in the army . I ai n't going to do any majoring . " " I mean , what is to be your life 's work ? Hurry up now . Let me know before noon . " Now , there is nothing they can do , yet they are told to make up their minds what it is . Suppose professors and teachers were told they could n't teach any more , but to make up their minds what they were going to " major " in . If somebody took my little jokes and good looks away from me , I know it would take me a right smart spell before I could make up my mind what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is voted out . Yours , WILL ROGERS .
