txt Common Sense Needed . Some are now telling us that lack of religion is responsible for our present predicament . There have been times when visitations of the plague were also blamed on lack of religion . That is , until the principles of medicine and sanitation were discovered . The use of these in a common-sense manner ended the plague . We have been plagued for a long time with grave economic and social ills . The remedies have been known and have been at hand . We have not used them , so are now suffering as a consequence . Have we the common-sense to use the remedies ? If we have n't , let us not blame further sufferings on lack of religion . Let us by all means be more religious , but let us also use common-sense and apply the remedies for our ills ? JAMES WATERS , Teaneck , N. J.
