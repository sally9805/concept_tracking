I DROVE A WHITE STEAMER BY ARTHUR H. LITTLE CITE was a hybrid , part model 1908 and part 1906 . Her headlights , each as big and as brassy as a cuspidor , burned acetylene that came from a generator mounted on one of her running-boards . Under way and well warmed up , she yowled , occasionally , with the voice of a banshee . In an insulated region directly under the sit-spots of her forward crew she carried steam at a pressure of 650 pounds to the square inch . Her engine , mounted vertically and forward of her dash , had been modeled after the fore-and-aft compounds that drove our freighters up and down the Great Lakes . Upon the threshold of each of the door-less doorways that led to her forward seats she carried a brass plate ; and the plates proclaimed that this automobile had been " built " by the White Sewing Machine Company of Cleveland . By 1907 , when Old Doc Van Tilburg bought his first motor car , the White engineers had engrafted into the White car 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow-meter they " modernized " certain cars of vintage 1906 . Forehandedly , they advance-dated their achievement . They called it the " 1908 system . " And , in their considered opinion , they had just about attained perfection . Old Doc Van Tilburg came to our house and said to my father : " I intend to buy an automobile . But I 've no place to keep it ; and I sha n't drive it myself . And so , I propose  --  with your consent of course  --  to keep it in your barn ; and theboy will drive it for me . Of course , I 'll pay him . " My father said AS far as space in the barn is concerned , you 're welcome to it . But about the boy 's driving for you  --  well , you 'll have to talk with him . From the way he 's been pestering me to buy a car I think he 'll be willing . " They called me in and laid the matter before me. said to the doctor : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must meet three stipulations . I 'd need to learn to drive . Driving for the doctor must not interfere with my school work  --  I was in high school . And because I 'd be driving , for pay , an automobile not my own , I 'd need a chauffeur 's license . Teaching drivers to drive , the doctor explained , was a part of the White company 's service . About the school work , I solemnly promised . About the license , Old Doc said he 'd write to the Secretary of State in Columbus . II She carried steam at approximately three times the pressure that , in those days , strained within the steam-dome of a locomotive ; but she harbored no crown-sheet , anxiously waiting to explode . Rather her boiler consisted of a steel tube , coiled into layers ; and her feed water flowed downward , layer by layer , toward her gasoline-burning fire . En route , the water " flashed " into steam , which emerged through the lowest layer ; and thence , through the main steam-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine ; and the engine , having tamed it , exhausted it nearly spent into the condenser , whose power-driven pump promptly pushed the resulting water back into the water tank . It was Art Burnham , a White company coach , who rode with me while I accustomed myself to a throttle that , for reasons best known to the White designers , opened and closed through a left-handed thread , It was Burnham who , leading a willing pupil into postgraduate work , told me that , rolling downhill , you could slip into emergency gear and , with almost no pressure at all on the foot brake , luxuriously coast . And it was Burnham who failed to make clear that that maneuver , in a steamer , was fraught with the potentialities of surprise . Later , with Burnham not at my side , but with Old Doc himself in massive state in the tonneau , I essayed the trick for the first time at the brink of Oak Point Hill . A few days before I had found my emer ? gency brake " frozen " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I thought judiciously , with kerosene . The kerosene , as I was subsequently to learn , had soaked into and saturated the brake linings . And now , before my headlights fell Oak Point Hollow , as mean a drop as you 'd find in all the lake country of Ohio ; and at the bottom of the hollow rose a hump-backed , jump-up bridge that crossed a lively stream . Here , I thought , lay an opportunity to show Old Doc a little fancy-work . Now a steamer lacked a clutch . For heavy pulling in emergencies , the White engineers had built into the rear axle a reduction gear whose operating lever rose from the floor to the right of your legs . I reached for that lever . I hauled it back . And then , belatedly , there fell upon me the realization that , back there at the crest , I had failed to come to a stop . And now engine speed and road speed refused to synchronize . And down that grade we started , hell-for-leather . I climbed the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot brake worked on the propeller shaft  --  the foot brake might as well have been on Mars . I hauled back the emergency brake . With its linings soaked in oil , the emergency brake might as well have been on Neptune . And we picked up speed . That jump-up bridge at the bottom , I knew , would turn us over , and turn us over quartering ; for you approached it through an S. And so I ditched her . I felt her wheels leave the ground , then catch again ; and forward , as we ripped into an embankment , rose the sound of falling saplings . She shuddered ; and , at about the same instant that she came to a standstill , I was out , down over her side , clawing at the weeds that rose above her running-boards . In high , dry growth , unless you were to run for your life before she set herself afire and blew up her gas tank , you shut off her pilot light . Then I opened a rear door . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The jolt , when we vaulted the ditch , had shot him skyward . He looked dazed . In his rumbling voice , he spoke . " I think , " he said , " that I hit the top . " I doubted it . He weighed three hundred pounds . He leaned toward me and said , " Look ! " On his shiny cranium , an area the size of a silver dollar oozed blood . " It seems , " I said , " that you 've suffered a slight abrasion . " I had picked up some of his diction . " It 's possible that your head did hit one of the top-bows . There is  --  eh  --  some bleeding . " Out came his huge handkerchief . He patted the spot " Even in this advanced stage of scientific progress , " he rumbled , " motoring never grows monotonous . " III Nor did it . For instance , there was the night that Harry Owen and I undertook to drive home from Sandusky . I had taken Old Doc to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone along for the ride . And , in the cool of the evening , Harry and I had headed eastward for the thirty-mile run . Maybe somewhere there is a land that is lovelier than the land of my birth , but I have n't seen it . To the north lay Lake Erie , in summer an expanse of blue that , at sunset , became a mirror of gold . And to the south gently rose the ancient ridges , ribbed with vineyards and patterned with woodlands in which , in spring , among the oak and hemlock and black walnut , violets reared their heads and May-apples hid  --  but not deeply enough  --  from the exploring fingers of woods-wise boys . Behind us the sun had set . Ahead lay the darkening east , blue-black , mysterious . And the prow of my craft unreeled a gravel road that ran between rows of poplars , a-whisper with the evening 's gossip . Harry Owen cleared his throat and said : " Detour . " " I thought I saw a barrier , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had thought to minister to the carbide generator , a copper-bound contrivance whose theory of operation often crossed you up by reversing itself . As you rolled along on the level the water-drip , which dropped water into a nest of carbide , would go dry and your headlights would die to twin pin-points of flame . Then , after you had hit the thank-ye-ma'am and the impact had jarred loose a water-blob inordinately generous , up would come the gas with a hissing rush ; and your headlights would flare as do the eyes of a person unexpectedly kicked in the pants . In Sandusky I had thought about the generator and had decided that , with the help of the moon and the co-operation of the gods of mechanisms , my lights would lead us home . But no moon had risen ; and the gods , it seemed , were busy elsewhere . " It looks , " said Harry Owen , " as if we turn right . " " Just a minute , " I said . I climbed down over the side , stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thorax . Hiss-s-s ! Up came the headlights . " Yup , " I said . " Right it is . " From the shore road , we swung south . On the hard , gravelly going my tires picked up a tune . I settled into the seat and relaxed . " Nice , " I said to Harry . " Smell that breeze off the lake ? " " Yes , " he said . " If only those lights ? " And then that steamer 's head end shot upward while her forward wheels hurdled something crosswise of the road . Up she went , and then slam , down she came . And we stopped , and I do n't mean gradually . We stopped then . " Just sit where you are , Harry , " I said , " and I 'll see what we 're into . " " Sit where I am ? " he said . " I 'm para . lyzedl " My own impression was that we had found the Immovable Obstacle , punched a hole through its side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed out and looked matters over . Across the road , piled so high that we had plowed a furrow through it , ran what looked like a breastwork . And beyond the breastwork , with my front wheels solidly wedged between its walls , yawned a black , straight-sided trench . " Not that it matters , " Harry Owen said , " but there 's a lantern coming . " The lantern came , and with it two men , one the farmer of the nearest farm and the other his hired man . I knew which was which because the farmer spoke as a taxpayer . " Well , sir , " he said to me , " that shows you how the county does things . They dug that trench jest today . They 've got the shore road tore up too . It 's for a drain . Before quittin ' time this afternoon they put a lantern on it and fixed up a dee-tour over there on the far side . I guess you did n't see the dee-tour . Well , a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern had burned itself out , and 1 says , ' We 'll put a light on it ourselves . ' And here we are . " I peeled off my duster and gauntlets and climbed into overalls and jacket . The farmer sent his man for a shovel . From the toolbox on the port side running-board I hauled out the jack . Then , from the trench bottom upward , we built two piers  --  precarious piers of earth and cobbles ; and upon these , alternately jacking and blocking , I raised the steamer 's head end until the trench sides released her tires . It was close-cramped , sweaty toil . The farmer said ; " There ! Now , if you 'll back her , we 'll h'ist , and she 'll pull herself out . Give ' er the power ! " I slipped behind the wheel and reached for the hand-fire . On a White the hand-fire functioned in the manner of a handpicked Supreme Court , blithely independent of all constitutional checks and balances . Here was a procedure that no instruction book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that steamer out . With her hand-fire open and her engine idling , her steam-gauge pointer swung to the right . I watched it reach 1,050 . Then I shut the hand-fire off , closed the throttle , threw the reverse lever into back-up , and slipped into emergency gear . " And now , " I said to the farmer and his hired man  --  breast-deep , they stood in the trench , one on each side of the car ? " you two better stand clear . " " Pshaw ! " the farmer said . " Give ' er the power and back ' er out ! Ready , George ? " From the other side came the voice of George . " Ready ! Give it to ' er ! " I gave it to ' er. 1 hauled the throttle down ; and that steamer 's engine churned . Her front end rose  --  then hung . I heard her drive wheels fight for traction , scrabbling , grabbing , tearing at the road . Then I smelled rubber . In a moment , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the steam . As to what happened next , I reconstructed the details later . With a lurch , the steamer sagged forward and downward . Relieved for an instant of the burden that had jammed them upright , our precarious piers had collapsed . And down her head end went , as deeply as it had dived before . And a hardhead lurked on the trench-rim , a hardhead that , on her first plunge , had missed her vitals . But this time she came squarely down upon it ; and that hardhead caught her blow-off valve and tore it out by the roots . Hiss-s-s ! Her headlights blazed . But that was nothing ! From beneath her , as 1,050 pounds of steam went screaming out through her rough-torn wound , there rose a sound that slashed and raked that night-drenched countryside as no sound had scarified it since the time when , with the hay fever upon him , Paul Bunyan sneezed and leveled miles of forests . Here was no mere explosion , quickly and mercifully over . Here poured forth upon the ether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon must deaden mortal eardrums as the sun , full-face , must blind mortal eyes . And after a moment , as it hammered at your consciousness , you no longer heard it , but only felt it  --  felt it in your breastbone and in your spine and in the marrow of your being . And then the Ohio night , outraged by this offense against its peace and dignity , fell upon this bellowing thing and tried to strangle it ; and , chilled by the evening air , what had been an invisible gas , screeching out through a jagged orifice , now became a vapor , then a fog , then a cloud that settled solidly upon us and shut us off from all mankind . And now our headlights , still flaring , shot their rays against a wall of white that shot them back into our faces . And , enveloped in what from the outside must have looked like a phosphorescent hillock of ectoplasm , that steamer roared and roared .... An eternity . Two eternities . Then Nature regained her reason . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . The fog dissolved . I looked round . In the seat beside me Harry Owen sat staring straight ahead . I asked him : " What became of the farmer and his hired man ? " I poked him and repeated the question . He turned to me and shouted : " I 'm as deaf , I think , as a post ! You 'll have to talk louder . " I shouted : " What became of the farmer and his hired man ? " " Oh , them ? " he shouted back . " Did n't you see ' em go ? I did . And if there 's some kind of record for a half-mile dash from a standing start in a ditch , then those two have just smashed it to smithereens . " He added : " If you think they can still hear , you might try coaxing them back with your horn . I think we 'll need them . " I squeezed the horn bulb . After a time , the two came slowly back , one from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the depths of the field to our left . This time the first to speak was the hired man . " If we 'd ' a ' knowed , " he said , " that she burned dynamite . . . " That night I did get a horse . In fact , I got a team of horses . The farmer brought them from his barn . And , after an hour more of jacking and blocking , we snaked the White out by her tail , then hooked the team to her front axle and towed her to the farmer 's barnyard . With the understanding that I 'd return in the morning , patch her up , and take her away  --  and on that last point the farmer was firm  --  he took Harry and me in a buggy to the interurban station in Huron . We caught the last eastbound car . As we settled into a seat , Harry Owen said : " After this , life 'll be so tame it 'll seem like living in a vacuum . " IV Those were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrink the continents , but then encountered high adventure on " reliability tours " from Cleveland to New York . On the roads , more or less uncertainly , ran motor vehicles that bore names that later were to disappear , or to become famous  --  the Popes ( Toledo and Hartford ) and Duryea , Haynes , Apperson , Packard , Prescott , Knox , Maxwell , Winton , Studebaker  --  these and the name of one who , in 1905 , had paid his dubious respects to a whole industry by advertising : " Do n't Experiment  --  Just Buy a Ford . " On the score of spectacular achievement , it did seem that steam had a future . In the East , at its " works " in Newton , Massachusetts , what had been the Loco-mobile Company of America was building the splendid Stanley , a steamer so fast that she created the myth  --  as the White also created it  --  that no man dared drive her with her throttle wide open . And to the Stanley , that which to-day is forecast as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commonplace : she carried her engine on her rear axle . In Cleveland White built for Webb Jay , professional daredevil , a streamlined , underslung howler that , with a fine disregard for gender , came to be known as Whistling Billy . As compared with the 650-pound normal pressure in White stock cars , Billy carried his steam , as a matter of routine , at an even 1,200 . For the business of getting over the ground with celerity , Billy had been lightened  --  denied a reverse and deprived of rear springs and differential . To negotiate turns while he was in motion his rear wheels were expected to skid . And , thanks to the 120 pounds of air-pressure that drove his fuel into his air-mixer , Billy 's vaporizer howled , not occasionally , but all the time . His fuel tank full , his air-pressure connected , his water tanks loaded , and his driver in the saddle , Billy could run for a maximum of about two miles . Then , for all his racket and for all the dust he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainspring had run down . But between his start and his stop , he did curl your hair ! In 1905 , with Webb Jay up , Billy went to the starting line at Morris Park and tore off a flat , oval mile in 53 seconds . Later in the year , on the same track , he ripped off another reverberating mile in 483/5 . When , in 1907 , Walter C. White , then the White company 's vice-president , undertook to enter a stripped , stock White in the Wilkes-Barre hill-climb , the worried president of the Wilkes-Barre automobile club wrote him that " it was found that a large number of gasoline entries could not be received were steam cars allowed to compete in the gasoline events , " and further that " the contest committee could see no other way to accomplish the greatest success of the meet than to admit the large number of gasoline cars by excluding the steam cars . " Permitted , finally , to enter as a freelance , White set a new record for the hill , and undercut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest of forty-five other cars , all gas . At Stucky Hill , near Chardon , Ohio , I saw White hang high another triumph . Barred by the rules from competing in any of the established classes , White went up that wicked grade in a time-trial ; and again his time swept the field . The next day the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported : " Although great enthusiasm was shown throughout the whole contest by the 10,000 spectators who lined the course , all were in a great state of anxiety for White ; for on his daring ride , the throttle was thrown so wide open that , at times , but two wheels touched the road . It really was a miracle that he controlled the machine ; for at the finish the judges were of the opinion that the car reached a ninetymile-an-hour clip . " And Walter White was to meet death in an automobile smash-up two decades later  --  not on a track nor in a hill-climb , but on a public highway between his Circle-W estate at Gates Mills and his Cleveland offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove a steamer ! Well , well ! Do you suppose steam automobiles will ever come back ? " If any one development doomed the steamers , it was an invention that gave gas cars a lap of lead that the steamers never overcame . It was the invention , for gas cars , of the electrical self-starter . Aiming at economical operation as a competitive talking point , White in 1908 bought out a steamer that burned kerosene ; and in the following year , overwhelmed by a trend , White surrendered and joined the gas camp . For a decade , the company manufactured passenger cars  --  and good cars too  --  propelled with internal-combustion engines , then gave up the private-passenger-car field and went in , exclusively , for gas-driven trucks , buses , and fire apparatus . Stanley went out of business . In the interim other steamers appeared , briefly , then disappeared ; and no steamer remains . Yet the automotive industry stirs , intermittently , with rumors that the Stanley , or the White , or some other steamer is to be revived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam engineering has advanced tremendously . Let a present-clay inventor find an evaporating medium that will resist freezing ? for nowadays an automobile that hopes to survive must run without too much fuss the year round  --  and let him find a non-freezing medium that will refrain from scaling a boiler 's insides , and , for all I know , the road will be his . But as one who has lived , I hope that he will not refine too much . I hope that , remembering Whistling Billy , he will not deem it necessary to excise the vocal cords . For I should want her to howl as Billy was wont to how/ when , in a hill-climb or on an oval track , upstarts dared dispute his right-of-way .
