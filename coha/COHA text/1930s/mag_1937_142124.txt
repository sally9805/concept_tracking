" The Committee is opposed to post-season football games of all descriptions , including so-called ' bowl games , ' feeling they have no part in the athletic programs of the colleges . We believe this to be so because such games serve no sound educational ends and such promotions merely trade upon intercollegiate football for commercial purposes . " <P> Adopted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association , in accepting the report of its committee to investigate influences inimical to intercollegiate sport , this pronunciamento was the biggest news contributed last week by the annual meetings of the N. C. A. A. , the College Physical Education Association and the American Football Coaches Association , held simultaneously in Manhattan . Meanwhile , an aggregate crowd of 219,000 watched 14 teams tardily conclude the football season of 1936 on the first day of 1937 in seven post-season games , from San Francisco to Havana . <P> When Pittsburgh was invited to play in the Rose Bowl , Los Angeles sports writers suggested their readers might boycott the game on the ground that the Panthers would provide no opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the publicity , the Panthers had sense enough to withhold comment until the ball was kicked off to them . The pushovers then began to push . <P> Gloomy Coach John Bain ( " Jock " ) Sutherland knew that Coach Jim Phelan had drilled the Huskies to watch Marshall Goldberg . 18-year-old Panther halfback . He kept Goldberg out of his attack , used him as a decoy to suck in the defense while Bobby LaRue and Frank Patrick took the ball away . Eel-hipped Patrick 's spinners knifed long gashes in the famed Washington line . LaRue pointed his knees at the Husky ends , hitting top speed in a stride or two while his interference took out the secondary defense as if they thought each play was a potential touchdown . <P> Patrick punched over the Panthers ' first touchdown at the end of a long march in the first period , their second when LaRue cut through centre for 44 yards and paved the way for him in the third . In the fourth quarter . Bill Daddio ' intercepted a Washington lateral , scampered 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in four Rose Bowl tries was watched by a capacity crowd of 87.000 . Score : 21-to-0 . <P> Chagrined when once-beaten , once-tied Pittsburgh got the Rose Bowl invitation , <P> Louisiana State , with no blot on its record except a tie with Texas , agreed to play Santa Clara , then the only undefeated , untied major college team in the U. S. , for the " national championship " in the Sugar BowL Texas Christian the following week dampened Louisiana State 's hopes by beating Santa Clara . Last week in New Orleans , Santa Clara doused them thoroughly by beating Louisiana State , with two touchdowns in the first period , another in the third , 21-10-14 . <P> Duquesne , celebrated for its victory over Pitt , picked to uphold the North against Mississippi State , did so in Miami 's Orange Bowl by the margin of Boyd Brumbaugh 's place kick after his own touchdown in the second period , 13-to-12.
