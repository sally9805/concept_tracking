THERE exists a mildewed tradi- tion that the average newspaper man , chasing truth through the labyrinthine byways of this curious world , feels an instinctive and violent enmity toward the press agent . ( To avoid confusion and to forestall hairsplitting definitions , it should be set forth at the outset that press agents are also known as public relations counsel , publicity advisers , advocates at the court of public opinion , good-will ambassadors , massmind molders , fronts , mouthpieces , chiselers , moochers , and special assistants to the president . ) Personally and professionally the press agent and the journalist are supposed to be bitter enemies , alternately wheedling and doublecrossing each other . Hostesses , dreading discord , have been fearful of inviting representatives of both callings to lawn parties , literary teas , and even formal dinners . One theory , held chiefly by wives , is that the newspaper man covets the pretty clothes , the enormous salary , the practically unlimited leisure , and the droves of fawning women which come so easily and naturally to the press agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bites his nails and translates his inferiority into an unreasoning hatred of all publicity men , from executive secretaries to the meanest barkers . Whether this theory is sound or not , the dislike is supposed to be mutual , constant , and deep . There is some sense in the legend , but it is mostly nonsense . As one who hasbeen a newspaper man since the days when it was illegal to sell liquor to a minor , and a city editor for so long that the memory of any previous life is little more than a blur , I can affirm ? to distort but slightly the familiar slogan of tolerance ? that some of my best friends are press agents . To be sure , the members of that amusing profession , like the members of so many others , range from the elegant to the scrofulous . They are , like judges and taxidermists , now acute and now incredibly stupid . They are engaged , for pay , in seeing to it that the interests they represent , whether it is Big Business or flagpole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too unfavorable , statement of their ease before the public . Of all the phrases they know ? and they know an amazing number ? the one they employ most in their conversations with reporters and city editors is , " Give us a break , old man . " It is , so help me , as friendly as that . Press agents to-day , although their number has increased tremendously and the methods of the craft have undergone many refinements , are after the same thing they always have sought ? free advertising for their bosses and the good will of the public . Frequently the goal they seek is perfectly legitimate ; merely to allude to what the gentlemen primarily desire is not to brand them all as anti-social practitioners of a bastard art . They are , in their essential aims , virtually identical with their forerunners in an uglier and far coarser era . They are bill posters who , catching up with modernity , have had their nails manicured and have put on top hats . Some of them have achieved a disarming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they used to be , and when the pickings are good they know it , as does everyone else within earshot . At bottom eternally the same , the only really disturbing change I can discern in press agents , as human beings , is that each year they pass out fewer good cigars . New York , as might be expected , is to the press agent what the blue grass is to the racehorse ; unfortunately for the business as a whole , the public relations experts abound in such numbers that , particularly since 1929 , the grazing has been painfully thin in spots . There are so many of them ! The Federal census is little help in estimating the number at work , or hoping for work , in the city , because the majority hide under misleading labels . It has come to be regarded as vulgar to call oneself bluntly and without apology a press agent . But if the whiskers could be pulled from all of them , a count would probably disclose the fact that New York has more than five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper men . And if all five thousand were swept away to-morrow by a tidal wave , another twenty-four hours would see another crop . These men , for all the sneers directed at them by proud but hungry newspaper men , are of vast importance in determining what the public thinks , feels , and buys . What they do , indeed , affects an astonishingly large percentage of the news that reaches the American people . Somewhere , in one way or another , the hand of the press agent has appeared in the inception ordevelopment of many of the items printed in any newspaper ? sometimes , by actual analysis , in more than half of the items . To state this fact is not necessarily to raise the suspicion of skull-duggery . A hypothetical social note , with only the names changed , will illustrate the stake which the press agent may have in the news : Mr , and Mrs. Mitchell Twitchell Twombly , who passed the winter at the Royal Barracuda , Seven Keys , Florida , are at the Hotel Nottingham . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for six weeks in England , and on their return Mr. Twombly , who is author of the novel , Pent House Mama , will begin an American lecture tour . It is possible that press agents for the following , whether they had anything to do with the appearance of the item or not , clipped the innocent little notice as evidence just in ease it was needed to show their clients : ( 1 ) for Mrs. Twombly , who is trying to go somewhere socially and happens to have enough money to hire a press agent ; ( 2 ) for the Royal Barracuda , which might be deserted without a press agent ; ( 3 ) for the resort of Seven Keys , which might never be heard of if it had n't had the foresight to hire a press agent ; ( 4 ) for the Hotel Nottingham , which , like all New York hotels of importance , must have a press agent if it is to have much standing ; ( 5 ) for the Dog Star Line , which in the matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 ) for the publishing house which is getting out Mr. Twombly 's novel , and ( 7 ) for the lecture bureau which is going to send the author around the country as soon as he returns from England . There are two gentlemen , Mr. Twombly 's own personal representative and the motion picture press agent for the company which is going to put his novel in the talkies , who might raise the number to 9 , but that might be stretching the hypothesis a bit . By no means should such an instance be construed as an indictment . If the responsible editors allow improper or dishonest matter ? which an account of the fascinating doings of Mr. and Mrs. Twombly certainly is not ? to get into their columns , whether by design or blindness , then they should be given a good talking to . To say that the prehensile finger of the press agent appears somewhere in the handling of many news items is only to say that he is getting along in human affairs , that he amounts to something , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may be , it is difficult to call the press agent a professional man . He may grow to that status ; but at the moment such a rating accords him too much dignity , and his enterprises are so diverse that a lot of people would be confused . One press agent , with visionary fervor , will compare his work with that of John the Baptist preparing the way for the Christ ; another , usually a low , plainspoken fellow who in his younger days was a police reporter , will discuss the genuinely startling similarities between himself and the middleman in the operations of the world 's oldest profession . Whether he is the frock-coated and urbane gentleman who represents the public interests of a great industrialist , or the nervous , hungry fellow who is trying to resuscitate a dying religious sect , the press agent in New York has a field that apparently is without limit . For New York , it must be noted , is a city which has seen publicity men representing Bishop William T. Manning of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone to the title of First Citizen , and Larry Fay , the entrepreneur of milk , taxicab , and night club affairs , who has a fairly valid claim , if he wanted to press it , to the distinction of being Father Knickerbocker 's Public Enemy Number I. The point , if there must be a point , is that the press agents for both the Bishop and the racketeer have performed valuable services for their principals which , in technic and essence , are identical . Doctor Manning and Mr. Fay could have exchanged press agents and , after allowing a few days for the boys to accustom themselves to new points of view , surroundings , and material , they would have felt that their public relations were as capably attended to as before . If that is n't true , then both the young publicity men have fooled me as to their ability . II The game , with much money at stake , is played on many levels . Between the high-priced Man of Idea-s and the cheap faker there is a gulf as wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi snake doctor . And yet , as a way of making a living , it has attractions for many men and women of more than ordinary intelligence . Publicity work draws to it the bouncing young man who does n't feel any natural yearning to remain forever on a newspaper as well as the editor who wakes up some morning to the sound of hardening arteries and realizes that be is headed down a dismal blind alley . Take even a brilliant and healthy journalist who happens to have a hungry wife and children in old clothes , and dangle before him the old triplethreat devil , Easy Work , Short Hours , and Big Pay ? try ' it on him and , unless he possesses marvelous stamina or is a dolt , depending upon how one looks at it , he will surrender . The cracked-up newspaper man who finds himself pushed out of his profession because of progressive illiteracy , spavin , or too much bad celery tonic , almost invariably turns to some sort of publicity job . Usually , because of his acquaintances , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful to certain interests . Another large group , among them some of the ablest , is made up of men who either had no newspaper experience or who were undistinguished reporters for a brief period . There is not necessarily anything in common between the talents of a great reporter and a great press agent ; indeed , many of the leaders of each group would he utter failures if placed in the other . Press agentry is the refuge of the incompetent ; it is also the hope of the go-getter who wants to do Big Things and make Real Money . Many young reporters can be spotted early as having all the earmarks of born press agents , and there have been instances of city editors saying to such young men : " Now , you 're a pusher at heart , but you 're not getting anywhere in this business . I know a good press agent job that 's open . It will pay at the start three times what you 're getting here . I 'd advise you to take it . " And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar glamour of his calling , it is always a little sad when a colleague , especially one of outstanding ability , goes into publicity work . Many newspapers dislike it so much when one of their good men leaves to become a special pleader for a political party or a soap factory , that they decide that , though he may be starving a year later , he will never be taken back . That is one reason why a great many fairly able men , seeking to return to newspaper work after publicity has proved less attractive than they expected , find the door closed . Here we have the visible effect of the jealousy between the men who worship the news and those who have forsaken it for the ballyhoo . Will there ever come a time when complete mutual confidence will exist between the two ? On some broad lines in the handling of public information there is no clash of interests , and there need be no clash , but in most cases the cleavage is there . The journalist , more truly than most men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tattered and frayed thing , but his own ; the aims of his publisher , which may be rational or quixotic , conservative or daring , and the whims of that delirious dragon , the reading public . The press agent , on the other hand , is the hireling of an individual , or a corporation , or of the leaders of a cause who have persuaded themselves that they are fighting at Armageddon . Thus his efforts have a singleness of purpose ? to impress the boss with effective publicity results , which in most instances means either the ability to flatter his vanity or to show him large reams of newspaper clippings , preferably of a favorable nature . Well , the press agent sometimes succeeds , though success may have cost him his hope of heaven . Some of the better-known publicity men have become so influential and respectable that the young man of to-day regards them with some of the same awe and admiration that the youngster of another generation reserved for Charles A. Dana . The big press agent ( that is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a press agent ) has made good . which is not news to him . The larger and more long-headed newspapers are always eager to find young men of exceptional promise to add to their staffs when the inevitable replacements , because of death , women , liquor , misplaced ambition , or mental sleeping sickness , must be made . One year my agents brought word that a certain senior in one of the larger Eastern universities was an authentic White Hope of Journalism . They were as enthusiastic as the scout who wires to Madison Square Garden that he has found another Stanley Ketchel fighting in the sticks of the Middle West . This young man , the agents said , was a brilliant student , a promising writer , with wide interests , an engaging personality , born of an old but exceptionally vigorous family , and with Lord knows what other charms . I sent a message urging him to come and confer . He seemed in every way to live up to advance reports . He had , as they say in the baseball training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper work , but before we came to an agreement I said : " Now , if you come on the staff , I should like to have it understood that you are coming with the intention of staying a long time , provided , of course , that you like the work and you turn out to be the man you appear to be . " He gave his answer instantly , and his honesty cost him his chance at the job . He said , " Well , to be frank , I 'd like to come on the staff for a year or two , but no longer . Then I want to take up public relations work . There is more money in that . " He mentioned the name of a man who has become known internationally as the head of a large publicity organization . He said this man would be glad to give him a job if he would first get some newspaper experience . The Wonder Boy may have known his own mind , and yet such cases have made more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time and patience teaching young men the groundwork of journalism , only to find that the paper has been used as a hatchery for press agents ? a starting point for propagandists who will devote the rest of their lives to the dissemination of material which must be combed , strained , and examined under a microscope before the beautiful germ of untainted truth may be isolated . Again , some thoughtful newspaper executives ? and one can name at least three ? have been pondering the figures which show that the schools of journalism , which at least theoretically have always bad the support of the press , are actually turning out more press agents than newspapermen . Thus the bread cast upon the waters bounces back in the form of bricks . There is no intention here to denounce the harassed reporter or copyreader who dreams of being delivered from chasing commas , checking up middle initials , or cooling his shins in anterooms waiting for a police sergeant to unbend and let him know whether the murdered girl had been hit with a blunt instrument or merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fancy himself sitting erect and Napoleonic behind a desk , dictating letters outlining broad matters of policy , telling people yes and no with dynamic vigor , letting his eyes feast on the paneled walls and the ship models and realizing that he is the man who stands between the destinies of a great industry and the public , that easily misled public which might get the wrong impression if the information reaching it had not been carefully and neatly scalloped around the edges ? if the young man envisions all that , who is to blame him ? It is generally accepted as truth ? although there are two sides to the argument ? that young men must eat . What a bizarre business the young man gets into ! If he is successful , and can attach himself to interests of sufficient importance , he can make a nation hair-conscious , tooth-conscious , torsoconscious , sweetheart-conscious , or even unconscious . Is the hat business stagnant ? Are a million ostriches wasting their plumes in the desert ? Then the big publicist is the boy who brings back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunburns every bird . These gentlemen , in the higher realms , have proved over and over that they can be worth the difference between success and failure to many industries . Able ringmasters of the herd , they rate a good deal more than grabbers of free space ; they are that too , but they are also industrialists , and some of them show disturbing signs of being philosophers . And yet this same man , for all his big ideas , has as fantastic a code of ethics , as flimsy a sense of obligation to ordinary intellectual integrity , as the lawyer who will defend without pay an issue which he believes to be right , and the next day take part in a blackmail game . That is to say , while a publicity man with one breath is telling the world that people ought to bathe oftener he may with the next breath be wheedling a society woman to sign an indorsement for a bed she never knowingly slept in . How he squares such things with his conscience there is no way of knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first , has atrophied into the squeak of a midget . Nevertheless , now and then , from the ranks there comes an indication that it is not satisfying to be spiritually bankrupt . One may perceive a yearning for respectability , for some sort of professional standing , for something even dimly recognizable as a code of ethics or of practice ? anything to take them out of the red light district of human relations . At least once a meeting was held and a code was drawn up . The difficulty lay in the fact that none of the genuine big wigs among the molders of mass opinion would take part . The upshot was that the code was adopted , and the organization elected as secretary the press agent of the chiropractors . Imagine Ivy Lee or Edward L. Bernays having anything to do with such stuff ! Those men haveimportant work to do ? Lee to be noncommittal when someone wants information about the Rockefellers , and Bernays to popularize the esthetic values of soap sculpture . Not for them to help evangelize a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seashore resorts , dance halls , and mind-readers . However he does it , the press agent has been conspicuously successful in the handling of many commercial enterprises , whether by unusual business sagacity or by a knack of wheedling Presidents into pressing buttons . Tody Hamilton , the famous circus press agent of another era , would be amazed at the changes that have taken place in publicity methods , just as the late J. Walter Thompson would be astounded at the evolution of advertising . A few years ago advertising agencies devoted most of their attention to straight advertising contracts ; their own money was spent in paying the salaries of a stall of experts who knew , or thought they knew , the art and science of advertising . As they grew and became more scientific , they added research workers and a large assortment of thinkers behaviorists , sociologists , trend-observers , symposium takers , geniuses with charts and graphs , men who understood women , women who understood men , and what not . All very well . Some of their doings may have sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what they were doing and felt proud of themselves . Now there are few agencies of any importance which have not at least one , and sometimes a whole staff , of men who are supposed to know how to get free reading matter into newspapers . Some business organizations have cut down their advertising appropriations and hired a clever press agent . Somewhere in this situation there lies a threat , as clearly discernible as the Grand Canyon , to both the editorial and business integrity of the press . What puzzles newspaper men is this : why do n't the space-grabbers realize that their efforts , far from encouraging good will , actually stir up the most violent sort of ill will ? The men who handle the news are especially resentful of such foolishness ; for honest news , like champagne , need not be diluted . To be sure , neither the advertising nor the news departments of newspapers have been notably wise in their approach to the problem . There is nothing like the downright blackjacking that once existed , when starving , toadying publications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leering whisper , " A little item on this would help , " has not yet passed out of the language . Indeed , it is beard more often than any passionate lover of journalism likes to contemplate . In recent years , despite the occasional success of the more highpowered press agents , the publishers have been fighting hack . They have organized a bureau which sends out bulletins warning newspapers of ominous clouds when there is an impending campaign for free advertising ? bulletins which disclose who is handling the campaign , what methods are to be used , and what product is supposed to be benefited . This counter assault has probably done some good , principally in making the news executives more secure in the feeling that the publishers are back of them in their efforts to keep the line between advertising and news from getting too inextricably snarled . And yet few plots have been disclosed which any news editor half awake could not have seen a mile off . If the publishers can hold their united front and insist that propaganda be kept out they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may actually be of value to society ? running tractors , raising flowers , manning filling stations , or making decent beer . The thing can be done , and the first principle to be accepted is that a managing editor , taking him day in and day out , is quite likely to know more about news than the proprietor of a department store ; just as the merchant prince , in all probability , knows more than the editor about how to move a big consignment of step-ins . It is all so reasonable and simple that the wonder is that any problem at all is allowed to exist . But hold a moment ! The abolition , or exile , of all press agents would create the wildest consternation in newspaper offices . Many important changes would have to be made in the methods of gathering news . Newspapers would be forced to add several more reporters to their staffs to cover news sources which now are taken care of by publicity men who have come to be known as reliable and whose material is welcomed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to keep more closely in touch with a multitude of organizations . Without the assistance of publicity men , who are supposed to do their best to make available the texts of speeches , committee reports , and other matter , it would be next to impossible for one reporter to cover competently a big convention . Newspapers are particularly friendly toward the representatives of charitable , civic , educational , and church enterprises , though these gentlemen . and it is a painful thing to say , are often greedy in their demands for space and uniformly unwilling to aid the press in obtaining legitimate information which conceivably might injure or embarrass , even slightly , the interests which they represent . If you want the whole truth , do n't go to the press agent , " is a fundamental rule , the exceptions to which are so few as to be regarded as miracles when they occur . But of course such men are useful . The bearer of a " news release " from a reputable public-spirited organization is always welcome ? not as welcome as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is the most beloved of them ail , and who would n't even try to deceive a forgetful elephant ? but welcome , nevertheless . One reason such men seek too much space is that they are bossed , usually by a hoard of managers , trustees , deacons , or overseers , who have an idea that their cause or institution is more important as news than the information that a statesman has just leaped out of a Broadway hotel window after an altercation with a famous beauty who had been helping him settle the international debt . Such people have distorted ideas . And one reason why the work of so many press agents for highly reputable groups is so sloppy and incompetent is that , generally speaking , they do n't get as much money as the press agent for the electric light business . It may be a shockingly revolutionary thought , but very frequently it takes money to attract talent . Although the millennium is still around the corner , there has been a great improvement , certainly in New York , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the clergy . A clergyman may often be found these days who will say frankly , " Yes , my group intends to fight the Bishop at the next convention " ; the reporter , on the other hand , sometimes knows the difference between a miter and a chancel . It is often possible these days for a reporter to ask a surgeon , " Is he dead yet ? " and get a yes or no answer instead of the old " I ca n't discuss that " ; likewise , there are reporters roaming New York who know the difference between phlebitis and athlete 's foot . There are lawyers whowill sit down and patiently explain away some of the ponderosities of the law , and there are reporters who can distinguish between a habeas corpus and a handsaw . A few enlightened press agents have had something to do with this improvement , though for the most part it has been worked out by the professions themselves in co-operation with the press . It may sound like a sinister opinion , but the experience of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with public utilities and with the larger industrial grouprailroads , oil companies , light and power interests , banking and steel ? are not nearly as bad as one might suppose . If one may discount the inevitable proportion of liars , the representatives of these enterprises are generally pleasant and satisfactory to deal with , and probably do more good than harm . The railroads in particular have improved . It is now often possible to get the truth , whether the news concerns a wreck or a scheme to get increased rates . The competence of these gentlemen , indeed , may have come to be relied upon too much . Thus the charge has been made that the publicity man , with his " prepared statement " or " handout " and his announcement that " there will be no further news to-day , gentlemen , " has dulled the news sense and lessened the initiative of reporters , particularly those who are a trifle tired already . Press agents ? most of them at least ? should live , but they should not be pampered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to tell the whole truth consistently , to realize that they have a duty to the public as well as to their immediate employers , all objections would vanish ? but a lot of press agents would starve . Justice Peter Schmuck of the Supreme Court of New York has held that the word " lousy " is not libelous , and yet it is a rank injustice for newspaper men habitually to employ that word as a prefix to the term " press agent . " The practice is monotonous and unfair , and newspapers have themselves to blame if they are imposed upon . What press agentry needs is weeding out . Some of the gentry really should enter productive work . It can be done if the newspapers will adopt a more vigorous and searching attitude toward the material of publicity , whether that material comes from the press representative of a grunting wrestler from Bulgaria or the adviser of a mountebank who is running for high office . As one who has been lied to , without the trace of a blush , by press agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of the time , it is possible to reach such a close approximation of the truth that the most captious customer is unable to find fault . Further , it is possible sometimes to examine the machinery of propaganda and explain publicly , " Now , this is just how this thing works . " No sound government bureau in Washington and no honest prizefight promoter could have a legitimate objection . IV Why anyone except their own pastors should worry about the souls of press agents is not easily answered , and yet one can not help feeling after listening to them cry softly into the beer , ale , Scotch , and rye along Broadway for years and curse their own strange calling , that the spiritual problem exists . They do become ashamed of themselves at times , though the majority , if they keep at it long enough , manage to smother their consciences . This fleeting sense of degradation , it seems , more often attacks the press agents for persons with overweeningsocial ambitions and for actresses who are incapable of listening to ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment . The art of swial climbing must not be confused with the attempts of a man to become merely a prominent citizen . The technic in each case is different . The press agent for the man or woman socially on the make must go about his work craftily , forcing his client to avoid the slightest mistake . The address must be right , in a correct section of the upper East Side . A home on the North Shore of Long Island will help , but Connecticut is just as useful . If the press agent is any good he will be able to shoehorn his client into a few clubs ? not too fast , but just one nice club after another . Yachts , horses , and dogs are desirable in moderation , but the climber must be watched or he will make a fool of himself and overdo it . Then there is the matter of the right charities , the opera , and a few trips to Florida and abroad . It is slow business , and costs money , but it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all decently . The test of success comes when the name is printed in the better newspapers as being among those at a pretty swank dinner party , as having come in from Old Westbury for the fall , or as having done any number of other things which are remarkable but in good taste . When the announcement of the daughter 's engagement is made , the press agent must see to it that it reaches the papers , with a prayer that it be used . Could a person achieve all these magnificent results without the assistance of a press agent ? Probably , but it would take a long time , depending upon the raw material and patience to wait out the game . Press agents who also represent hotels of high social standing are extremely useful . There is one who used to work for a hotel and for several of the occasional guests . He charged the ambitious guests a basic weekly rate for attending to their public relations and he charged the hotel double advertising rates for every line which the New York papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not at all . No one was injured ; everybody was pleased . The Great Man racket is somewhat different . There are men who do n't give a hang about being welcomed into society , in the Social Register sense , but who have a mad desire to be known as Big Shots . One such man , now under indictment in New York for his unorthodox stock promotion methods , reached the city only a few years ago as a total stranger . He had no more known background than a Bellevue Hospital foundling . He knew enough to hire a press agent . He became a big man in Wall Street , he announced large donations to religious enterprises , he became one of the world 's greatest aviation enthusiasts and the pal of champion prizefighters . Dynamic , ruthless , affable , broad-visioned , sympathetic , popular ? the man , it seemed for a time , would not be stopped . Indeed , it is possible that if he had kept his press agent he would have avoided the costly mistakes which finally brought him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persons who seek to lift themselves out of the anonymity which cloaks the mass of mortals , and who hire the professional ministrations of press agents to aid them , are either pathetic or amusing , but they do not do much harm . The press agent who works for them may feel sheepish , but his crime has not been great . If he can stand it. , who is to shame him out of it ? The chief crime of the publicity system lies in its appalling waste . It requires no efficiency expert to figure that millions arc thrown away eachyear in futile efforts to advance some person , cause , or thing . White paper , photographs , ink , stamps , telephones , telegrams , messenger service , stenographers ? these run into money . It is probable that an average of three hundred thousand words of press agent material of one sort or another is received at the office of every New York newspaper every day in the year ? material which for the most part has no chance of being used , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American business pays for such foolishness is one of the mysteries of the machine age . Enough money is thrown away for purposes which may be respectable , silly , or downright shady to do wonders to the national debt and to buy a new hat for every reporter . If it could be cut down to reasonable limits , the wear and tear on human communication systems would be vastly lessened . But waste and futility are not all . Many practicing newspaper men have found that the press agent often may he an effective barrier to efforts to obtain even the most harmless news items . Many important persons ? that is , important as sources of news ? have come to believe , usually through the persuasion of their press agents , that it is distinctly bad form to give an interview on any topic unless the publicity adviser is present . Thus it is impossible to get a forthright answer to an ordinary simple question . The press agent is able at times to cow his boss to the point where a question like " How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned over and over and examined for a hidden motive before the answer will be given . The press agent is at his best in such interviews , in which he acts as a midwife while a great man frees his mind of his opinions on the wheat market , the increase in burglary among children , and just how far the Church should go in its attitude toward birth control . The press agent not important ? Why , he runs the show . One large New York corporation has a firm policy that all newspaper men who seek interviews or information of any sort must arrange through the director of publicity for the audience with whatever person is sought -- from elevator starter to president . A reporter wanted to see the president on a subject the discussion of which would have been of value to the corporation . The president was willing , but he felt bound by the rules and insisted that the reporter work through the regular channels with the press agent . There arose another difficulty , for the press agent was In conference " every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the idea was outdated , and the reporter could n't have used the information even if he had obtained it . Clearly there is a field for honest and effective publicity , but as the work is conducted by most of the virtuosi to-day it is a drain on industry , often a drawback rather than an aid to the unhampered spread of intelligent information , and an almost maddening nuisance to newspapers . Having a weakness for statistics , I kept a check one day recently on the number of press agents who telephoned me . There were twenty-six , many of them good friends of mine , from whom I was delighted to hear , hut the net result of all those conversations was that only five of them had anything worth printing . Here are some examples : A press agent for a preacher , a notorious publicity seeker , asked me if I were interested in the fact that the great man was going to attend a narcotic conference sometime in the distant future . Another requested me to send up " one of the better-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigaretteblindfold test . There was , he said , fifty dollars in it for the reporter , whether he guessed right or wrong . Another spoke highly of the astonishing spiritual profundity of a visiting yogi ( not a very prominent yogi at that ) , and wanted to know why his remarks would not be considered as important as the sermons of the Rev. Harry Emerson Fosdick . He hinted that there was a prejudice against yogis somewhere . Another said he had landed a publicity contract with a foreign palmist and asked me to dismiss all my weighty problems for an hour or two and run up to Forty-second Street to have my palm read free . Another wanted advice whether to try to crash the society page , the real estate page , the financial page , the amusement page , or one of the Sunday sections with the news that the cornerstone of an apartment hotel was to be laid the next week . Another asked me how I felt , how the family was , if I ever got out to lunch , and then asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station was not omitted from whatever report might be carried on a politician 's speech to be delivered that evening . Another came down to cases , said that he had noticed the depression in many lines of business , and offered me a generous cut if , when I heard of someone who was about to let a publicity contract , I would " throw it his way . " Another wanted me to go back to the library , if I could not remember offhand , and tell him the date of the death of a Congressman . Why some of the experts , out of the great mass of fine , charming , intelligent , high-minded fellows who have gone into public relations , persist in such nonsense , I leave for abler thinkers to decide . What to do about it ? Nothing at all . They will be with us forever .
