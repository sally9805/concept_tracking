Having voted on the income tax sections of its billion-dollar revenue bill ( TIME , May 30 ) , the Senate last week continued its long wrangle over inserting tariff provisions . Oil and coal duties had been adopted . Log-rolling logic and gentlemen 's agreements now necessitated doing something for lumber and copper . Nebraska 's Norris tried to break in with a revival of the Export Debenture to benefit farm products , insisted that some form of farm aid must go into the bill if tariff features were being added . He was brushed aside by a vote of 46-10-23 . Lumber was voted ( 36-10-24 ) additional protection of $3 per 1,000 board feet . Copper was given a tariff of 46 a Ib. by a vote of 45-to-22 . The Senate then proceeded to : <P> Approve the House excise tax on trucks ( 2% ) , raising the House rate on pleasure cars to 4% , parts 2% . <P> <P> Approve , with slightly different rates , the House excise taxes on cosmetics , jewelry , sporting goods , cameras , firearms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , motorboats , yachts . <P> Approve a 2% excise tax on chewing gum , 2% on tires , 4% on inner tubes , special taxes on communications ( exempt : news dispatches ) , real estate conveyances , stock &; bond issues , safe deposit boxes , oil pipeline tolls . <P> Amend the House theatre admissions tax to provide an exemption of 40% . <P> Approve the Finance Committee 's increase in second-class mail rates ( upped to 3 zone ) and first-class rates ( upped 1 ) . <P> Reject a special 25% tax on admissions to horse and dog races . <P> Revenue estimates now added up to some 940 millions , at least 50 millions short of a Budget-balancing total . But with every day 's delay the financial condition of the country was growing worse . From day to day the Treasury 's revenue estimates were shrinking . It became apparent that some broad new base of taxation might have to be sought . It also became apparent that some of the voting for stiff " nuisance taxes " was for the purpose of exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax . What tax this was , everyone knew-a Manufacturers ' Sales Tax such as had been beaten in the House . <P> Not since the Civil War has the U. S. had a general sales tax . Last September Pennsylvania 's Senator Reed proposed a .5% tax on all retail sales , calculated it would bring the Government two billion dollars a year . President Hoover did not favor it . In March a 2.25% sales tax ( estimated revenue : $595,000,000 ) was presented to the House by the Ways &; Means Committee , damned as a measure to rob the poor , defeated 223-10-153 . <P> Last week Senator Reed voted aggressively for each &; every " nuisance " tax item that appeared . In addition , he got back of the second-class postal rate increases . What he expected soon happened . The potent motor , radio , cosmetics , and candy lobbies whose products had been singled out for taxation sent up a wounded howl . The proposed tax on bank checks trod on the toes of the American Bankers Association . Publishers , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
