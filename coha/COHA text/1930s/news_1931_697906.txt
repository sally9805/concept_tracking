txt A device by which flying can be made possible the year round in Canada and the northern United States without difficulties has been invented by R. G Perry , who is vice-president of the Ottawa Flying Club . He exhibited it at a meeting of the Canadian section of the Society of Automotive Engineers : ' ere . The contrivance is constructed to be operated on land In runways of snow pr ice and to provide protection against mud in the spring . It has been tested out in these conditions and found to be practical . A hydraulic jack was used for operating , and when the wheel was not in use it was placed in a ' shoe . The ski , as he illustrated it , was made to keep out of harm 's way or to be lowered and the wheel placed in its pocket . In case of the craft getting stuck in the mud , the ski could be lowered partially , so that it touched the ground and assisted in pulling the machine out .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
