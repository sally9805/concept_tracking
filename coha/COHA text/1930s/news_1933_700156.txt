txt Stressing that the war debt of Great Britain to the United States should be regarded not as a commercial loan but as a matter of war necessity , representatives , of the British Government began today a detailed submission of their case in a threehour conference with the American experts . No definite proposal was submitted , and the conversations did not reach the stage where present-day monetary problems , such as currency stabilization , were developed , but it was made plain that the British negotiators felt any settlement should take into consideration world economic conditions . Those at today 's conference were Sir Ronald Lindsay , the British Ambassador ; Sir Frederick LeithRoss , head of the British mission ; his associate , T. K. BeWley ; UnderSecretary of the Treasury Dean Acheson ; Daniel W. - Bell , commissioner of accounts in the Treasury , and Frederick Livesey , assistant economic adviser of the State Department . It was announced that the next meeting would be held Thursday . While the deliberations were behind closed doors ; the secrecy that had marked the earlier debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter submitted , by the British before him , freely discussed the viewpoints presented by Six Fred- ' erick . The United States representatives apparently continued their role of sympathetic listeners . Points in British Argument . Points on'which the British argument revolved , according to the information given out , were : 1 . The origin of the debt . .2 . The use to which the debt was put  --  to a large extent for destructive purposes . 3 . The fact that the British Government was the first to fund its debt to the United States , and , that settlements to ether debtor nations were made on a much more lenient basis . 4 . The changed status of the world economic picture since the original settlement was made . Mr. Acheson explained that in discussing the origin of the debt Sir Frederick had observed that during the war the  --  British Government purchased great quantities of materials in this country . It was declared that about 80 per cent of the British purchases in this country had been made before the United States entered the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of trade balances , shipping and other services , the mobilization of gold and securities , and the flotation of large commercial loans . The war debt represented only about 20 per cent . An estimate was given that British expenditures in the United States had approximated $12,000,000,000 . After the British had eaten so heavily into their own resources the United States came into the war . The British , said their representa- tives , were found to be in no position to go ahead and the question arose of how to carry on . - ? This was answered by the borrowings from the United States Government . It was at this point that the British experts emphasized that these advances should not be viewed as commercial loans , but as a necessary action in carrying on the war . Sir Frederick , it was said , held that tVirtually all the advances by this government had been spent for war purposes . the original funding agreements ivere reached was then undertaken . The British contention , it was declared , was that no one could have foreseen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events that have since taken place . It had then been hoped that economic conditions would improve , and instead they are even worse today . British Trade Drop Noted . Sir Frederick was represented as having discussed particularly economic conditions in Great Britain , including the sharp decline in her foreign trade . At the time of the funding agreement the payments were estimated at less than onequarter of the exports of Great Britain to the United States , and now the annual payments are greatly in excess of such exports . As to the dealings by Great Britain with her allies , the British estimates indicated that Britain had paid.to the United States all she had received from her allied debtors and about $750,000,000 more . Still another point stressed was that as a result of the fall in prices the payments represented twice as much as on the basis of 1917-18 prices . The British computation of war expenditures in this country was accompanied , it is understood , by an estimate of the amount of excess profits taxes levied by the United States Treasury on manufacturers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete cancellation have contended that these taxes accruing to the Federal Treasury probably equal the amount of money lent to Great Britain . From this they advance that cancellation would not involve any actual loss to the pockets of the American taxpayer , since the Treasury , in fact , only lent to Great Britain British money collected by taxation of British purchases in this $1,000,000,000 for Munitions . Again it was stressed that a large part of the borrowings had been spent for munitions , for purposes of destruction , and not for materials with any lasting value . It was estimated by the British , according to Mr. Acheson , that at least $1,000,000,000 of the total borrowed had gone for munitions alone . Regarding the funding of the debt , the British experts contended , according to the Treasury official , that on the basis of 31/2 per cent interest the British debt settlement involved repayment of 99 per cent of all amounts advanced to Great Britain , while other debtors were treated with more leniency . The British argument further contended that , whereas the British debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances made to the allied nations , the British payments on account had approximated 80 per cent of all payments feceived by this country .
