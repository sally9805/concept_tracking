One night in 1898 a shoe salesman and a paint salesman found themselves assigned the same room in a hotel in Boscobel , Wis . Said Shoe Drummer John H. Nicholson : " My custom is to read a portion of God 's word every night and give thanks for God 's care over me during the day . " Replied Paint Drummer Samuel Eugene Hill : " I , too , am a Christian . Let us have our devotions together . " <P> A year later , joined by an insurance man named Will D. Knights , Salesmen Nicholson &; Hill resolved to organize a Christian society of drummers . Unable to agree upon a name , they prayed together until Insurance Man Knights arose , exclaimed : ' ' The Christian Commercial Travelers ' Association ! The Gideons ! " Opening his Bible he read from Judges how the Lord had placed a sword in the hand of Gideon , " a man who was willing to do exactly as God wanted him to . " <P> Not until 1908 did the Gideons begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hospitals . Since then Bible-giving has become their one big job . They have given away 1,300,000 at an average cost of $1 , today boast that sooner or later they find donations to fulfill all requests with neat volumes now bound in whiskey-proof keratol . Until last week all three founders were still active in business and Gideon affairs . Then Death came to Samuel Eugene Hill , 70 , in Beloit , Wis . To the funeral went Insurance Man Knights , 83 , of Wild Rose , Wis. , and John H. Nicholson , 75 , now field secretary for the Gideons . <P> The one locality the Gideons never penetrated is the citadel of the U. S. Bible trade : Manhattan . There the New York Bible Society supplies free Holy Writ to the hotels and there flourishes the largest Bible publishing house in the Western Hemisphere , the American Bible Society . The latter organization , 120 years old , last week passed another milestone by dedicating a new $500,000 home , a six-story stone building at Park Avenue and 57th Street , remodeled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House had been a landmark in fusty , downtown Astor Place . From its big old red brick building , it has sent out 135,000,000 Bibles and texts in 972 languages and dialects to all parts of the world . Bible House still belongs to the Society , will continue to be used as a storehouse for $2,000,000 worth of printing plates for Bibles in 49 languages . That the Society could move uptown and across the street from William Randolph Hearst 's swank Ritz Tower might seem evidence of prosperity . Actually it is an eleemosynary institution , well-endowed by people who are interested in providing people all over the world with the Word in their native Worrora , K'Pelle , Cakchiquel , Zapotec , Mpongwe of Karamojong . The Society sells a well-bound Bible in English for 30 , will give one gratis to a needy person anywhere .
