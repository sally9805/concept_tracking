txt Praising Commissioner Moses . I have repeatedly enjoyed the delightful hospitality of the Columbia Yacht Club and can quite understand the praises of its beauty voiced by your correspondent Mr. Lamb . But I must confess it was always with an uneasy conscience , as I realized that I was one of a very small group who could enjoy this privilege while thousands of my fellow-citizens , who far more than I needed the refreshing breezes and coolness , were kept away outside the fences and never allowed to enjoy the privileges of this club on the banks of the great river that belongs to all . It seems almost too good to be true that we now have so honest , fearless and public-spirited a Park Commissioner as Mr. Moses , whose far-sighted vision is bent on giving all our citizens the benefits of our great fiatural resources which have so often been reserved for a small group .
