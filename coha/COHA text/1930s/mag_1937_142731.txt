" A few miles from my home there is an imaginary line . . . . " With these words Pennsylvania 's Governor George Howard Earle last week startled 600 members of Washington 's Southern Society dining in the Willard Hotel . His hearers , being Southerners , supposed at once that he was referring to the color line . Only two years ago his Legislature passed and he proudly signed a law giving Negroes equal rights with whites in all Pennsylvania 's hotels , shops , restaurants , theatres ( TIME , Aug. 12 , 1935 ) . Useful as that law has been in winning Negro votes for the Democratic ticket in Pennsylvania , today , when Governor Earle has become an aspirant for the Democratic nomination for President in 1940 , it is a major embarrassment . <P> Only for a moment , however , did Governor Earle leave his hearers in doubt about his imaginary line . " From my present home , " he said , " it is only an hour 's drive to the Mason-Dixon line . From my birthplace in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether I am north of it , in my home , or south of it on my farm in Cambridge , Md. , I find men and women occupied with similar problems . . . . " <P> Thereafter he had only the kindest words to say of that section of the U. S. which reveres both the Mason-Dixon and the color lines : " Was it not the Solid South , bulwark and Gibraltar of Democracy , that gave us Franklin Delano Roosevelt as President of the U. S. ? * I need not tell you how that solid , united support of the South saved our Nation from destruction . . . . It was a Virginian , George Washington . . . . It was another Virginian , Thomas Jefferson . . . . It was Old Hickory Jackson , from Tennessee . . . . We need , above all else , peace . . . . Our great Secretary of State , Cordell Hull of Tennessee . . . . Mrs. Earle . . . a daughter of the Blue Grass State of Kentucky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech there could be no doubt that Governor Earle had undertaken a great feat , never before performed by man : having made a political crossing of the color line , to make a political crossing of the Mason-Dixon . <P> *The correct answer to this rhetorical question is , of course , No . Had the South voted solidly for Hoover in 1932 , for Landon in 1936 , Franklin Roosevelt would still have been elected in each year by a big margin .
