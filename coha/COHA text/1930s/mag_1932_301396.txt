Last week virtuous Moscovites and Tartars were rewarded by Dictator Josef Stalin . He decreed as a signal boon that all collective and even individual peasant farms in Moscow Province and the Tartar Republic are authorized to sell any surplus grain which they may have left for what it will bring . <P> Throughout the rest of the Soviet Union , state grain collectors ( supported where necessary by troops ) will continue their unpleasant job of " collecting " as much grain as they can lay hands on , paying for it at the State 's fixed ( low ) price in rubles . Nominally worth 50 gold , the Soviet ruble is not quoted on international exchange , can not legally be exported from or imported into Russia but has a value in the hands of clandestine money changers of from 3 to 20 . For 100 poods ( 60 bu. ) of average wheat the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets of Moscow Province and the Tartar Republic surplus wheat will bring at least 2,000 rubles per 100 poods.
