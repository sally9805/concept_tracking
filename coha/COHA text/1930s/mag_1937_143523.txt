After the World Series and before the spring training camps open , U. S. baseball fans find little to read about their favorite sport . In December they usually have a brief bright spot when the businessmen who run baseball get together to swap players . This year 's meetings were not as bright as usual . <P> The minor-league convention was held last fortnight in Milwaukee . Most important news was that Manager Jimmy Dykes of the Chicago White Sox and Manager Mickey Cochrane of the Detroit Tigers had worked a trade : Pitcher Vernon Kennedy , Infielder Tony Piet and Outfielder Dixie Walker of the White Sox for Outfielder Gerald Walker , Third Baseman Marvin Owen and Catcher Mike Tresh of the Tigers . Consensus was that Jimmy Dykes had slipped one over on his old teammate in the biggest deal of the year . <P> Then the major-league overlords who had been bartering at the minor-league conclave moved on to Chicago last week for the major-league meetings . The National League promptly proceeded to make no news by re-electing President Ford Frick for three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlords went U. S. baseball manufacturers to discuss balls of varying degrees of deadness , which had been tried out last season . The National League , which thought the American League was bound to follow its choice , forthwith voted to adopt the No. 4 ball , one degree deader than the ball used last year , on the theory that a deader ball would curtail the American League 's superior batting . But the American League , thinking of the large gate receipts produced by its slugfests with the lively ball , used by both leagues since 1934 , voted to retain the " rabbit " ball . In the 1938 World Series the competing teams will use the ball of the home team .
