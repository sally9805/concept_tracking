THE CHILDREN A STORY BY ROGER BURLINGAME T " HE elephant is tired , " said George , who was also tired for the moment of being Malcolm 's adopted uncle ; so he threw himself on the sofa from which he could see Ellen sitting in the window . Ellen had adopted him first and she was the best of Madge 's children , he thought ; but now , these days , when they all came Saturday afternoons ( because Jo was off then at her bridge club ) Ellen would withdraw and be lost in a book and was only good to be looked at . " Elephants do n't get tired , " Malcolm said and , seeing that George was distracted , prepared to repeat it . Ellen would be sixteen  --  or was it fifteen ? ? in the spring . " Uncle George , " said Malcolm . " Elephants ? " But Ellen was satisfactory to look at there in the window away from the odd decor of his  --  of Jo 's  --  modernistic apartment . " I mcan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner where the twins were . " You moved it six . I saw you . " Angry shaking of dice answered . " You need to be watched , " came the menacing voice again , very shrill . " It was on a red , " the other twin said , lower . George could find no difference in the twins except in the pitch and time of their voices , but Madge , he supposed , was aware of other distinctions , being their mother . One voice was high and impatient , the other was low and deliberate . When they talked at once , which was usual , they were like a fugue . George could never be sure of their names and thought of them as the high twin and the low twin and , on the whole , the least inspired of Madge 's children . Ellen , in looks at least , was inspired by Madge , and Malcolm derived his serene beauty from Bruce , his father , and the baby was too young to worry about and much too young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the twins . . . well , they were twins , which made for uncertainty ; they were complementary and contrapuntal . All the afternoon the fugue had gone on in the corner , audible even above the frenzies of Malcolm shooting tigers from the elephant 's back . Malcolm looked now , vaguely , at the twins and looked back . " What I mean to say is , " he said , " elephants . . " " Yes , they do , " said George . " Old ones . " Ellen had not moved except that her hand turned mechanically the pages of her book . She sat there through all these sounds as if she were out of range . It was remarkable , George thought , to be able to withdraw so ; it would be alarming but for that regular motion of her hand as though she had gone out of her body and left it there . But her position was good and satisfying ; George would have liked to watch her so for an hour until he stopped thinking . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the light made a sharp shadow under the curve of her cheek , and the curve of Ellen 's cheek was pleasing and nostalgic . It was easy , looking at her , to drop back a good many years and , if she sat still , the magic was not disturbing . In moments when she was talking or laughing , when her face was nervous or animated by impatient thought , it was terrifying to have her turn suddenly into Madge ; for you knew she would change instantly back to Ellen , and Ellen was merely Madge 's daughter  --  an independent person and a member of the New World . Now it was more normal , and if the Sorcerer could be persuaded to make Malcolm and the twins disappear , everything else would change ; the room would no longer be modernistic but dateless and bright with yellow flowers ; out of the window you would see an older and less dramatic street with a row of brown houses instead of the giants , Chanin and Chrysler . Possibly if you went on long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a worn upright piano . At any rate , life ahead would be empty and into it you could project warm hopes ; the slate would be clear , for the Mistake would not yet be written upon it , bitten into it , indelible . " Old elephants , " said Malcolm dreamily ; " very old elephants . They live to be a hundred , Dad says . . . " Dad , saying this vicariously , snapped the spell . Malcolm 's father and mother , the twins ' father and mother , Ellen 's father and mother  --  her father too ; Bruce and Madge , their children . Saturday afternoon and Jo off at her bridge club , the apartment cool and impersonal , the summer dying outside , night coming on , evenly , and Chaninand Chrysler defying it . It was better to come back quickly and to know how solid the world could be . " Why do they live to be a hundred , Uncle George ? Did you know that , Uncle George ? You knew they lived to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get tired ? " Ellen looked up , keeping a finger at her place . Her enormous eyes were vague , feeling the pull of the book still upon them . " You heard what the elephant said , Malcolm . He knows better than you do when he 's tired . " " Oh , all right , Ellen . " He rose on his toe , revolved three times , and fell forward on his hands on George 's knees . " Then we 'll have to do something else . " Madge would never have looked as serious as Ellen looked . She might have felt serious . But Madge had two levels to her mind ; she expressed the lower in terms of the upper , so that she laughed sometimes at appalling things . She could laugh , once in a while , at the Mistake even , though George could see the currents moving in deep places below her laughter . " How many times do I have to tell you , " said the low twin , that it 's bad form to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high twin , " that 's all you ever talk about is form . " " You 'll never get anywhere in the world without form . It 's like tennis . That 's why you 're such a lousy tennis played " " He can beat you , " said Malcolm . " I seen him . " " Saw , " said Ellen not looking up . " Yup , I saw him . " " Yeah , overhand , " said the low twin . " That 's a fine way . I 'd be ashamed to beat Tilden overhand . " " Uncle George , " said Malcolm , " will you do Dave and Golly ? " " It 's too hard work . " " Garden of Eden , then ? " " The snake 's no good in that . I 've got to work some more on the snake . " " Hell . " said Malcolm . " You 're not supposed to say ' hell ' before grown people until you 're fifteen . " " Twins does . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad form . " The low twin looked up from the backgammon . " I suppose that 's a crack , " he said . " I suppose so , " said George . He looked back at Malcolm who was desperate . Malcolm was the living spit of his father . He had all of Bruce 's good looks and when he grew up he would have his serenity too . " I 'll do Speakeasies for you , " said George , and Malcolm ran and climbed on the piano bench . David and Goliath and the Garden of Eden and Speakeasies were piano stories . The piano often had to be tuned after David had slung his stone . The Garden of Eden had too much Prithlingsrauschen in it . Speakeasies was the best because the shots of the federal agents were on the very high notes which were rarely used for other purposes , and the cocktail-shaking and the pouring from bottles were noteworthy . George went to the piano and began . Malcolm sat quivering beside him and explained . " That 's beer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ooh , there go the cocktails . Bang , bang on the door ! Fed'rals ? " " Sh , no , cops . " " Yah , to tell ' em the fed'rals is coming ! " When the last shot had been fired , George leaned back exhausted . There had been a long afternoon what with the elephant and other things . Ellen laid down her book , came behind him , and put her cool arms round his neck . She tilted his chin back and kissed him on the forehead . " Will you do me a favor ? " she said . " What ? " " Play ' La Valkie des Cloches ' ? " " Why ? " " Because . And then I 'll take ' em home . " " You 've been very boring , Ellen , with your book . " " Well , gosh , I 've got to have a vacation sometimes . " " You could have arranged something to keep them quiet and talked to me . " " About old times ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no doubt about the laugh . George closed his eyes an instant ; Ellen caught him and put her hand over them . " Stop it , Ellen ! How old are you ? " " You know . " " I forget . " " Sixteen in March . " " That 's old . Still , you know a lot . VG-hat have you been reading ? " " Strange Interlude . " " Is it all right ? " " It 's twisted in spots . Gosh , I do n't know . I like it when they say what they do n't say in small print . " There was silence . The twins had paused in their play and were staring as if they were awed by some mystery . Even Malcolm sat still on the bench and twisted the string of his blouse round and round in his fingers . " Play ' La Vail &; des Cloches ' and we 've got to go , " said Ellen . " It 's late . Mother and I 've got a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of smells in Madge 's place  --  smells from the oven and of wet things in the kitchen . It would be very noisy there when they all came in  --  yells and slamming of doors and running of water in the bathtub , and Madge would be in the center of it , working . The lines would show hard in her face under the glaring light . . . Madge .. . Ellen stopped the twins , for the dice were too noisy ; one got up and wandered away out of the room ; the other curled in the corner of the window seat with a book of unconscious drawings from Adler . Malcolm slid from the bench and walked down the room . Even his walk was like Bruce his father ; his feet came down evenly in parallel lines , not turned out like most persons ' . His head was shaped like Bruce 's , and he had Bruce 's short , athletic neck . When he grew up he would sweep someone off her feet in that serene way . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds with him , and he would not notice it . George played . As he played he thought : Here it would always be cool and impersonal . Nothing could have been designed so devoid of personality as these modernistic things  --  they never quite dared call them " modern " ? these angular nickel lamps and this cuboid furniture ; these shining surfaces and diagonal shadows . You could live a hundred years with them and they would absorb nothing of you . Outside , though , when the sun had set , the giants would come alive with light and be good to look at against the sky . George became conscious that Malcolm , lying on the far divan , was playing with the blue-glass animals on the shelf . If he broke one , which was almost certain , there would be a row to-night because Jo prized her blue-glass animals and had a great collection of them . George was going to stop and speak about this but then he caught Ellen 's eyes ; she was leaning over the piano watching him , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he finished , Ellen said : " You would do that . " " What ? " " Play Grieg 's nocturne . " " Why not ? " " Because I said the ValMe des Cloches . ' " " Did you ? I was thinking about the nocturne . " " That was one of them , was n't it ? " " What ? Ellen , I wish you 'd stop that boy from playing with those things . " Ellen turned and looked at Malcolm , then she turned back with a queer smile . " Your Aunt Jo will raise the devil if he breaks one . " " I hope he does , " said Ellen . " Why are you so vindictive ? Do n't you like your Aunt Jo ? " " She is n't my Aunt Jo . I adopted you as an uncle , and that 's as far as it goes . " George looked at her a moment and said : " You 're having a fit of the romantics . " " No , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ellen . taught you that . " " Yes . You 've taught me a lot of things , George . Ge-or-ge ! " She drew out his name slowly . Her eyes did not move . The crash came , then , down the room . It was a small , sharp , splintering sound followed by " Oh " in a high voice and silence . " There , " said the twin emerging from Adler 's unconscious . " You might know he 'd break something . " " Yes , he would , " said Ellen . George got up . " It is n't funny , " he said . He went down the room and looked at the pieces of Jo 's blue giraffe . How completely they break when they do break , George thought , and felt impersonal about it as he looked at the circle of little blue pieces . " It broke , " said Malcolm , serenely . " You 've got to get over breaking things , " George said . " Now there 'll be trouble sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ellen in a weak voice . The twin came and took his small brother by the shoulders . " Cut it , " cried Malcolm . " Tell Uncle George you 're sorry you broke Aunt Jo 's blue animal . " " It was a giraffe . Ooh , stop , I 'm sorry I broke the blue .. . I 'm sorry ! " Ellen herded them together then . They found the other twin in George 's bedroom , smoking cigarettes . Ellen got them all into the outside hall , where Malcolm supported himself by his thumb against the elevator bell . Then she came back . " Kiss me good-by , " she said . George looked a moment at her dreamy eyes and said : " Yes , you are a romantic . " " Only for the moment . I 'm pretending I 'm in love . " She waited an instant and said explosively : " Listen , George , you 've got to tell me something because I 've got to know . What was the matter ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ? Whose fault was it ? " " The fault of youth . Why have you got to know ? " " I 'm young . I 'd know my own mind , you can bet . " " Watch your step , my dear . " " And if I was wrong  --  if I found I was wrong  --  I 'd smash things till 1 got it right again . " " Get Malcolm to help you . He 's good at it . " " You need n't laugh at me . I 'm serious . " " That 's why I laughed . Do your smashing early , Ellen . Things grow big and tough quickly , and it 's harder . Children , for instance . " " That 's sentimental . " " Children ? Ones under fifteen , I meant . There 's the elevator . Watch the lights on Third Avenue . The traffic is tricky there . " They were gone , and George was relieved . He went through the cool room to the window . He had meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over the city , and Chrysler and Chanin were growing enormous in the haze . The lights came out and it was pleasant watching them . After a while Jo came in and turned on one of the nickel lamps . " Why do you sit in the dark ? " she said . She was beautiful . She was cool and smart . George , looking at her , began to understand the room . It was against such a cold and geometrical background that Jo looked best . In seventeen years , he thought , she had never grown less beautiful and she had kept her girl 's figure through seventeen years of marriage . She had been careful about it with diets and exercise and . . . Well , Jo had made her decisions and they were , presumably , her affair . " I was watching Chrysler and Chanin , " said George . " You look lovely , darling . " " Do I ? I 'm not sure . No one has said so to-day . I 'm dead , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a cocktail . " " It 's her day out . I 'll make one . " The giraffe , George thought suddenly , and went toward the door to get out before she saw it , but do stood in the way . " You ca n't squeeze oranges and all that , " she said . " Yes I can . Come and watch me . " Jo had grown straight and rigid . " Those children have been here , " she said . Yes. , ' " Have they got to come every Saturday ? " " They might as well . It 's your day for the bridge club . Did you win ? " She turned away from him . Now she will see it , he thought . He started down the hall . " George ! " " I was going to get the cocktails . " " Come back here . " Yes . " " Why do you want them .. . here ? " " I 'm their adopted uncle . " " You 're an arrested development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well . . . " " You 're trying to throw it in my face . " " What ? " " It . . . them . Everything . Every week when I come home dead tired you parade them in front of me . " This was not consistent , George thought as he mixed the cocktails . If I were an arrested development , he thought , I should not have intelligence enough to throw anything in anybody 's face . It would be a very subtle cruelty to do that to Jo . As a matter of fact , he thought as he poured in the gin , it never occurred to me . George could not remember whether he had poured in one or two gins . As he stood trying to remember with the measuring glass in his hand , the smell of dinner came through from the kitchen where Hilda , the temperamental cook , was working . There would be awful disorder at Madge 's with all those tired , yelling children . There was also the baby . Why had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hell of a time Bruce had had making the money for them to live even the way they lived ! If it had been he , would Madge have lived any better ? Selma came in off the service elevator . " Throw this away , Selma , " George said . " Ya . " " And make new ones . " " Ya . " When he went back , Jo said : " Is Selma back ? " " Yes , she 's doing the cocktails . " " Tell her to come in and sweep this up . " She was looking steadily at the remains of the giraffe , but she was not angry . George felt relieved . " I 'm sorry about that , Jo . " " Which one did it ? " " The smallest one . " " Oh . . . the one that looks like his father . He 's the best . " Jo was animated at dinner . George knew that it was the animation of fatigue , but Jo was still startlingly beautiful and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was keeping up and a note in her voice like the note of a tight string . She talked about the bridge and an exhibition of Matisse and the things that they would do in the evening . She was a different person now as if , dressing for dinner , she had changed herself , with only that hint of fatigue remaining . George warmed to her ; it gave him an odd , man-of-the-world feeling to be sitting opposite to her at this softly lighted table . When Selma came in with the salad she said that someone wanted him on the telephone . " Are you sure , " said Jo , " that it was for Mister Bart ? " " Ya . " George looked a moment at the lace tablecloth , wondering who it could be . " It must be Eisendorf , " he said , getting up , " about the piano . " " Again ? " said Jo . George went away to the telephone , which was at the end of the tong living room . It was almost dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light from the giants coming in the window . He would tell Eisendorf not to bother . In the summer he had paid Eisendorf extra to come on Sunday for the tuning , when they would be away . Now he would tell him not to bother . When he heard the voice over the telephone , he had to wait a moment while he adjusted his mind . Then he said : " Oh , hello , Madge . What are you laughing at ? " " At you . You answered and then you went away . " " I thought it might be Eisendorf . " " I wanted to thank you about the children . I 'm sorry about Malcolm breaking that . " " Yes , the giraffe . That was bad . Is he in bed ? " " They 're all in bed except Ellen . " " Are you tired ? " " No . Why ? It 's cool and quiet here . Ellen 's gone to sleep over her lessons . " " Is . . . he there ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would like you to come . " There was a long silence then . It was pleasant , George thought , not to speak ; the telephone was a fine thing , he thought vaguely , that people could hold in their hands and so be in communication without speaking . There was a light singing over the wire , a steady , happy sound that held the continuity . " Ellen 's gone to her room , " Madge said at last . " She laughed when . . . it broke . " " Jealousy , George . She thinks she 's in love with you . " " Is she . . . does she ? " " It would not be surprising . " " She seems so old . She knows a good deal . Have you told her ? " " No , she imagines it . " " About the nocturne ? " " No . Did you play it ? " " Yes . . She said ? " " She was guessing . " " She looks like you  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ago , George . " " No . Not very long . " " Seventeen ? " " Oh , yes , years . " " They do something to your face . " She listened a moment and said : " Ellen must have gone to bed . " " So you 're alone . " " Yes . " " Will he come soon ? " " Not till very late . " George waited a while , thinking hazily . Then he said : " It 's no use , is it ? " She did not answer that . " Everything is so solid and estab-lished . " " Yes . I 'm part of an institution , George . For the good of the race . It 's solid and safe . " " Yes , " said George . " And good , I suppose . " " I do n't know . I never get far enough away to look at it . Would you like to come for a while ? " " I do n't belong . " " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a close corporation , Madge . You have built four walls round it . Five . I 'm outside . " " On account of the Mistake . " " The children are not mistakes . They 're facts . " " And you and I ? Are we a myth ? " " Yes . An old saga good for winter nights . " " A true one . " " All myths are true . " " Ellen likes glamour , does n't she ? " " She does n't think so . She wants to be stark and grim and break things she does n't like . She 's a romantic . " " So am I. " " God help us all , Madge . " " Good night , George . " " Good night , Madge . " With the click , the room drew back into its impersonality . George could never get over his surprise at its aloofness . No matter how you dis-ordered it , it would go back , almost immediately , into indifference . Now the cushions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and stood again at their geometrical angles . Everything was straight and cool and sterile . George got up quickly and went back to the warm dining room . " Who was it ? " said Jo . " What ? " " On the telephone . You were gone long enough . " " Oh . I was saying that it was no use . " " What do you mean ? Who was it ? " George stared at her a moment and his eyes and his mind settled into focus . " It was Eisendorf , " he said .
