At the eastern boundary of Cleveland , conspicuously painted with glistening aluminum , stands one of the strangest hospitals on earth . The main building is a steel sphere 64 ft. in diameter , the height of a five-story apartment house . At the base , like garden slugs under a puff ball , are two horizontal steel tanks the size of bungalows . All three structures are built to withstand the force of compressed air in which Dr. Orval James Cunningham , the designer , has his patients live . <P> Dr. Cunningham , 54 , originally from Kansas City , believes that organisms which live only in the absence of oxygen cause certain forms of diabetes , pernicious anemia , and cancer . To him , the logical treatment is to saturate the patient with oxygen under pressure , which theoretically permeates to the morbid organisms and kills them . The Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Association , after due consideration , has denounced this theory of therapy as so much quackery . Nevertheless , Henry Holiday Timken , reclusive roller-bearing tycoon , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,000,000 to construct his tank hospital in Cleveland . <P> James Henry Rand Jr. , chairman-president of Remington-Rand ( office equipment ) had sufficient faith to entrust Mrs. Rand to Dr. Cunningham 's aerotherapeutics . And their son James Henry Rand III , onetime University of Virginia medical student , had sufficient faith to understudy Dr. Cunningham for the past seven years . <P> Last week young Mr. Rand bought Dr. Cunningham 's sphere for $500,000 , will henceforth operate it with the help of Dr. Carl William Iuler , 36 , as the Ohio Institute of Oxygen Therapy .
