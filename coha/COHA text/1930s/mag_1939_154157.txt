The " little crisis " which agitated the western end of the Mediterranean last month , when Italians " spontaneously " demanded Tunisia and Corsica from France , popped up again last week in the southern end of the Red Sea . <P> With Premier Edouard Daladier about to make a swing around France 's North African possessions to promote " empire solidarity , " France 's East African colonists in French Somaliland were suddenly thrown into a panic by reports that 80,000 Italian troops were about to march over the border from Italian East Africa ( Eritrea , Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia ) and seize the country . As long as 18 months ago , Paris colonial officials noted that detachments of Il Duce 's troops had occupied areas on what was probably the French side of the ill-defined French Somaliland-Italian East African border . For weeks the fascist radio station at Addis Ababa had broadcasted predictions that the French would be pushed out of Somaliland into the sea . <P> After 9,000 alarmed Somalis , Arabs and Indians paraded the streets of sweltering Djibouti with banners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Ethiopia the French Navy Ministry dispatched two warships to the scene . The Colonial Ministry sent a detachment of 650 Senegalese sharpshooters from Marseille to strengthen the little Somaliland garrison of 1,500 colonials . <P> If the Italians have the makings of a just claim to Tunisia-out of which they were rather crudely muscled by the French in 1881-they have a juster claim to a foothold on the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb , the 15-mile-wide channel between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden now dominated by French Somaliland on one side and British Aden on the other ( see map ) . Those who control Bab-el-Mandeb control the southeastern vestibule to the Mediterranean . <P> In 1935 , Italian Premier Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Pierre Laval signed a treaty ceding to Italy not only a piece of desert south of Libya but a strip between French Somaliland and Italian Eritrea which would have given Italy a position on the Gulf of Aden , the island of Dumeria in the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb and a share in the French-owned Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad . <P> These territorial readjustments had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining the Allies . But the concessions were never made because Foreign Minister Laval was booted out and Parliament refused to ratify his dealings with II Duce . Last week II Duce took occasion to renounce publicly his end of the pact , hoping that a new African settlement , based on the Wartime promises , can be wrung from France and Britain . He wants most the Addis Ababa-Djibouti rail line of which all but the easternmost 50 miles runs through what is now Italian territory , on which practically all the traffic is Italian . The only way the colony can get to the sea without using the line is by way of the new but much longer highway from Addis Ababa to Assawa ( not to be confused with the dead-end military road from Assab south to the Somaliland border ) . <P> In her reply to Premier Mussolini last week , France left the door open for further discussion , but announced firmly that : 1 ) she would not cede one inch of French territory ; 2 ) that she wished no third party to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
