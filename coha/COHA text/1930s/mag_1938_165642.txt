The Milky Way galaxy has been popularized as a vast agglomeration of stars shaped like a lens or a discus , or like two very shallow saucers glued together rim to rim . So far as the dense masses of the Milky Way are concerned , this is scientifically correct . But in recent years astronomical research has disclosed , far above and below the disk , a sparse population of stars which cosmically and gravitationally belong to the Milky Way galaxy . Harlow Shapley of Harvard Observatory , famed cosmic map maker , has interested himself in these galactic outriders . <P> At a meeting of the International Astronomical Union in Stockholm last week , Dr. Shapley reported on 2,000 Cepheid variables ( giant stars which fluctuate regularly in brightness ) at considerable distances from the Milky Way 's central plane . These have the effect of stretching the galaxy 's " vertical " diameter to about 80,000 light-years. ** The diameter across the disk is put at 100,000 lightyears . Thus , the flattish lens of the Milky Way is enclosed in a globe of stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> <P> **One light-year equals about six trillion miles .
