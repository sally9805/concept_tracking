txt The possibility that discount rates and Federal Reserve open market operations may again become primary factors for finance and security markets to reckon with was called up in a speech last night by Joseph Broderick. member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system . Without indicating that there are any early moves in mind , Mr. Broderick told the Boston chapter of the American institute of Banking how in the future the Reserve System 4,411 proceed to combat undue credit expansion . According to the Federal Reserve Bulletin , last change in discount rates was May 14 , 1935. when the Minneapolis Bank changed the rediscount rate from 21 , .. 2 to 2 . Last record available on sale of governments of any size is for January , 1931 . Mr. Broderick explained that having exhausted its power to raise member bank reserve requirements , the system will now turn to " the normal credit instruments of open market operations and discount rates . " Open market operations will be used to " set the stage for discount rate policy " by eliminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to discourage member bank ? borrowing if the system decides to put the brakes on credit expansion . Can Prevent Expansion More Easily " The board , " Mr. Broderick explained , " has now taken the final step through increasing reserve requirements to reduce excess reserves on May 1 to about $500,000,000 . The present volume of bank credit , notwithstanding a lower volume of business operations , is larger than it was at the pre-depression peak in 1928 and 1929 . The purpose of the board 's action was not to counteract an existing inflation , but to prevent an injurious credit expansion ; to use the lan-. guage of the law . The Federal Reserve System is thus placed in a position where it will be closer to the market and can more easily prevent an injurious expansion if it should theaters to develop . " What an increase in requirements accomplishes is to place the Federal Reserve System in a position where it can influence the behav= for of member banks through the normal credit instruments of open-market operations and discount rates . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While the banks have reserves far in excess of their needs the Reserve system is powerless to influence the rate of expansion or contraction of credit . The power to influence the volume of bank credit through reserves and through open-market operations and discount rates , places upon the Federal Reserve System the grave responsibility of seeing that legitimate business is always accommodated at reasnoable rates , and that the volume of accommodation in the aggregate is at a rate best adapted to a stable condition of business and credit . The Federal Reserve  --  System recognizes the gravity of this responsibility . We also recognize that so many factors in our economic life are beyond our control that the goal of a full utilization of our national resources at all times without violent fluctuations can not be achieved by monetary means alone . We can , however , contribute our share to this achievement , and it is to this purpose that our efforts are dedicated . " Mr. Broderick traced the change over the last 22 years in the conception of bank reserves which first were regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " high-powered money " which lies at the root of credit expansion and contraction .
