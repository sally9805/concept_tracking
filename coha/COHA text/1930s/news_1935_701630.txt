txt The swastika will no longer appear on British Boy Scout badges because it is the symbol of Nazi Germany . This decision was made by the Boy Scouts ' association council , who desire to keep aloof from political and religious controversy . " There are no politics in the movement , " an official explained : " it embraces all creeds , so It is essential that nothing to which objection might be taken should be worn by the Scouts or issued by the association . " The swastika was on the " thanks badge " usually presented to people outside the movement in recognition of some service to Scouts or Scouting and also on the medal of merit , a comparatively rare distinction given Scouts . The two badges bear the Scouts ' crest , and prince of Wales feathers superimposed in a swastika . Badges already awarded will not be withdrawn , but the holders may exchange them for redesigned badges .
