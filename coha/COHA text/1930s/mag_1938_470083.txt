WHERE is a story , cherished on the I campus of Smith College , which tells of a bounding freshman of seventeen off for Christmas vacation who deposited a bowl of goldfish on the steps of the President 's house , with a scrawled note : " Dear Mr. Neilson , please take care of my fish until I return . " Mr. Neilson did . A college president who knows what to do with visiting goldfish presents peculiar problems to intending biographers . I wrote five hundred Smith alumnae and received five hundred answers describing a man half-Aristotle , half-Puck . I journeyed to Northampton and talked with undergraduates who bubbled like a soda fountain out of control . I talked with professors and instructors and gained a vivid impression of a faculty in which confidence prevails . Neilson of Smith must have boarded many goldfish during the past twenty-one years . William Allan Neilson , who retires from Smith next year at the age of seventy , has been teaching most of the time since he was thirteen . The death of his father , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the frail , shy , small boy to make his own way . He became a " monitor , " a pupil-teacher at a stipend of ten pounds for the year , free to acquire his own Latin and Greek before nine o'clock and after four . We catch a glimpse of a solemn little boy to whom tears came quickly , set against the dour background of the rigid Calvinism of his home and village . We see him , later , trudging to the preparatory school at Montrose , reading as he walked , acquiring the stoop which he hascarried through life , restlessly searching that truth which is beauty , that beauty which is truth . And then a fleeting picture of the adolescent at the University of Edinburgh , catching life as he could , taking honors as he went , restive under the barren classicism of the time , rebellious against the Scotch religionists who ruled education . But he broke through , thanks in part to an uncle who was termed a freethinker and who introduced the boy to Matthew Arnold , thanks also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a somber lad of twentytwo who graduated from Edinburgh with honors in philosophy in 1891 , and set out for a new world , to teach English in Upper Canada College in Toronto . The old world had conferred learning , the new was to yield him a house of freedom , in which abided fear neither of the gods nor of the Greeks , His four years in Canada were followed by three years in Harvard , where he received his doctorate in 1898 , then two years of teaching in Bryn Mawr , four years as an instructor in Harvard , two in Columbia . Then in 1906 he returned to a Harvard professorship in English which he held until 1917 . These were years of fulfillment , happy for him , happy for his students , as he made Shakespeare live and Burns sing . He had found release in a balanced sense of life 's verities , illuminated by a sure perception of the humor which life holds . A faculty comrade of those days tells of the hours after work was done , of " Neilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burns and old ballads or arguing about the world 's affairs . " When we left his room after an hour or two , with Scotch wit ringing in our ears and a bit of Scotch on our palates , thoughts of the next day 's lectures had vanished and we went to bed in perfect peace of mind .. .. It was not merely the merry fellowship . it was the extraordinary insight and wisdom . . which was so stimulating . . . . It was also the immense human sympathy and interest which he brought to every ques-tion ? ' At Harvard Neilson became a close friend of Charles W. Eliot . When Eliot made a speech half in jest announcing that all the needs of an educated man could be met by a " five-foot shelf " and a publisher had invited Eliot to prepare such a shelf , Eliot turned to Neilson and asked his aid in choosing and editing the " Harvard Classics . " They worked together for eighteen months , months in which Neilson could learn the secrets of one of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the definition of the prime requisite for a college president : " Some people say courage , I say patience . " In 1917 , Sidney B. Fay , who had taught with Neilson in Harvard and had gone to Smith , decided to bring Neilson and the Smith trustees together . He persuaded Neilson to visit Northampton , showed him the college and the campus , introduced him to the trustees . Shortly after Mr. Lamont invited Mr. Neilson to take the presidency of Smith College . Two obstacles intervened . Mrs. Neilson must have a house adequate for the entertaining which she must inevitably do . Mr. Neilson , fearful of the ecclesiastical precedents at Smith , did not propose to conduct formal religious services and would not lead in extemporaneous prayer . Lively memories of Scotch churches stuck . Mr. Lamont laid both fears . Mrs. Neilson would have a house . Mr. Neilson could define prayer as he pleased . Mr. Neilson was appointed . II There are as many varieties of college president as of tulips , and each reveals his peculiar markings in due season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share of common stock ? by his yield . He delivers endowments , buildings , and art collections , and his trustees pronounce him a great educator , raise his salary and send him to Europe . There is the president who is a born manager , and his trustees admiringly say , he might have been president of the First National Bank . There is the president who is a natural advertiser , with that divine gift of making the worse appear the better cause , and his admirers affirm that had he turned his gift to publicity he might have been as great as Bruce Barton . There is the president whose impressive front serves the same function as the heavy columns of the buildings which lineConstitution Avenue , supporting nothing but reassuring the taxpayers . And then of course there is the president who has ideas on educating . He belongs to one of the rarer species . In the fall of 1917 the students and faculty of Smith asked themselves what manner of president had been sent them . An alumna of that time describes Mr. Neilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mild and genial scholar , " she writes , " of whom there was little to fear . . . but I was Scotch by inheritance . . . and there was a glint in the President 's eye which gave me pause . . . . Within a month the college was on its toes and walking lightly . " " Have you a daughter ? " desperately put a frantic father whose daughter would not quite behave . " Yes , " said Neilson , " two thousand of them . " A visit to Smith Chapel confirms this statement . When he is to speak , and it is known , the room is filled . He reads a bit of Scripture or of poetry , he reads the Lord 's Prayer , and he talks . His talk ranges all the way from the troubled international situation to the personal habits of the girls . He never talks down , he takes the girls ' intelligence for granted , but it is the talk of a wise and witty father with his daughters . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sitting on your shoulder blades to read " will lead to lumbago and sciatica . Another day he gives swift comment on the moving events in Spain . Then , again , he will describe the way in which students march down the streets of Northampton , four abreast , " jostling feeble members of the faculty , like myself , and honorable citizens into the gutter . " Another day there will be simple words on the meaning of human liberty , and then he will describe the train from New York on which they returned from vacation , and his " impression that the train was owned by Smith College ? yet you certainly had not paid for all of it . " When some students frame a petition for more entertainment on the campus , he reminds them of " the spoiled brats of Park Avenue bored by nurses who are trying to entertain them . . . If you do n't know how to entertain yourselves , cut out all entertainment until you have acquired a fresh appetite . This all seems to me a clear symptom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time than you know what to do with , I shall advise the faculty to give you more work . " His straight talk is sometimes barbed . When the library reports that books disappear he uses the word " thieves . " Again , facing the student body freshly returned from Christmas vacation , " I wish you all a very good New Year and a much healthier one than I am really hopeful about with all the coughing in this hall . The college now sets about trying to repair the damage done to you by your parents and the vacation . We shall fill up the infirmary and try to take care of the rest of you in the houses . The advice I gave you before you went away about moderation in your pleasures and plenty of sleep has apparently been ignored . " When the Boston papers told of scandalized Northamptonites being forced to watch Smith girls roaming about in shorts , he told them to quit their roaming . He wins the students because he can meet them in every mood . His infectiousgaiety sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can count on him . " Never once did he let us down , " writes an alumna . He makes the students ' cause his own . When Northampton neighbors complained that girls did not lower their shades when undressing , he suggested to the townspeople , " Pull down your own shades . " When a ribald student paper of a neighboring college announced in loud headlines that Smith girls were easily kissed , angry Smith students eagerly discussed what form revenge should take . But they had no need to plan . Smith 's president did the revenging , in just one sentence in chapel . " My advice to a daughter would be , kiss only gentlemen , for gentlemen do n't tell . " But when tragedy comes he has other tones . When there was a ghastly automobile accident in which several Smith girls and Amherst boys were killed and injured he faced a full chapel with words which were not taken down , but which every student of that time remembers . " He told us , " writes one of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the moral courage to refuse to go with men who had been drinking .... The campus was hushed all that day . " But his contact with the students does not end with chapel . They tell me that girls go out of their way to pass the president so that he will speak to them . And his is more than a formal greeting , as witness a breathless freshman who reported to her roommate " a funny old man with a pointed beard tried to pick me up on the campus . " Another very young freshman confided her hope for just one thing before she left college ? that she would faint before the Neilson home so that Mr. Neilson would carry her in . And an alumna remembers the day she was stopped by the president , who remarked that her shoes should be fixed ? the heels were worn down . Another writes of the time she planted radishes in the flower bed below the president 's office window , and of his twinkling gravity as he accepted the handsome bunches which she tendered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a parody on Alice in Wonderland , " fairly dancing down the aisle in a yellow wig , a plumed hat , a blue jerkin , yellow satin knickers , silk hose and slippers " ? obviously admiring himself , and admired . And an alumna from the War days reports on his handling of those solemn questions which rock colleges from bow to stern . It was the commencement season of 1918 , and some students felt that simplicity and economy were in order . They prepared a memorial to the faculty asking that simple dresses be ruled for commencement . The students were received by a faculty committee , with the president presiding . The proposal called for " little white organdy dresses , " and provoked heated discussion . Feeling ran high . Suddenly Mr. Neilson leaned across the table and whispered to a most formidable and highly starched woman faculty member , in a stage whisper , " Does this mean , Miss X , that you . .. and / . .. must appear in little white organdy dresses ? " A college president must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirked discipline , although he knows full well that " it is through freedom and not through compulsion that the human spirit gains in power and reach . " " You are here , " he told the college on assembling one fall , " to grow into women . We do not believe you can do so without having a large measure of freedom to control your own time and your own actions ? a large possibility of going wrong . And the strength of mind that is demanded of the administration of a college like this is to stand by while the risk of your going wrong is operating and to keep hands off . The an of governing here as elsewhere is in knowing at what point a student ought to be temporarily saved from herself by compulsion . I say temporarily , because compulsion can never save her from herself permanently . She alone can do that , but from time to time one has to intervene to prevent irreparable damage . " As a disciplinarian , he must deal with Venial and mortal sinning . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had long prevailed , and that usually means a fantastic multiplication of sins . Smith had not yet shaken free of those endless rules by which student conduct is regulated . Smith students , for example , might not smoke . As president , Neilson had to uphold the rule so long as it was on the books . He did it in his own way . " Smoking , " he told the students , " is a dirty , expensive , and unhygienic habit ? to which I am devoted . " When an ashtray filled with cigarette butts was found in a dormitory the culprit told the President , " Each butt is the souvenir of a perfect evening . " She won . When the smoking rule was finally lifted , Neilson 's advice was explicit , " Smoke if you must ? but smoke like gentlemen . " He can inject gaiety into discipline . When two girls , in an excess of hospitality , took their two Yale visitors for a swim in the Northampton reservoir , he had to dismiss one of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the other , being a freshman , was allowed to remain . He disposed of the whole matter in one chapel sentence : " I prefer my drinking water unflavored by either Smith or Yale . " And , like the wisest disciplinarian , he knows how to close his eyes . There is a story , perhaps apocryphal , of the girl who returned after closing hours , and was struggling to pull herself up on to the fire escape without making much progress . Suddenly she felt herself effectively boosted from below . Safe on the fire escape , she turned round to find that her rescuer was the President . But college discipline is not all the enforcing of rules on smoking and late hours . There is plenty of room for major as well as minor wickedness in a college of two thousand . The Judicial Board , the students ' self-government court , handles the cases which come before it ; but a member of that board in other years reports that Mr. Neilson repeatedly " tamed down our judgments . . . we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give her a second chance . " Another alumna reports on such an experience . A classmate had been caught ? in sin . The sin was definite and proved . The Student Council was obdurate ; the Dean firmly refused to intercede ; but the President persuaded the Council and the Dean , and the girl stayed . Mr. Neilson as a disciplinarian has picked the difficult middle path between the college where every turn of the hand is controlled and the college whose chief pride is its entire absence of all restraint . Through it all one feels his distaste for rules , and the sense that they are ignoble things at best . For , after all , students " who wish to waste their time and opportunities must be allowed to cheat themselves until such time as we find it necessary to separate them from the college . " He is possessed by a sense of noblesse oblige , he knows what sacrifices are behind the girls in college , and he can urge them " retain your self-respect in not being wasters in a world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , while Neilson is wise and witty , he is no great educator . One expects such reactions in every craft . His misfortune as an educator is that he has no bag of tricks . One gathers that he suspects bags of tricks . While one youthful president discovers that education will be saved by a return to Plato , while another invents the thesis that education will be revived by the holding of conferences on grassy lawns , and still another , impatient with older disciplines , throws off all the fetters , Neilson has gone his way without any visible breaking of tradition . Mr. Neilson 's method is the old one . He seems , in effect , to say : First , let us collect students susceptible to ideas . Second , let us collect teachers with ideas , and capable of imparting them . Third , let us provide a setting which will encourage the contagion of ideas . It is difficult to make such a course appear revolutionary . Mr. Neilson has made no effort to make it appear revolutionary . He proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumption which still needs proving to those who give money with which to endow colleges . Neilson sees no reason for tempering the educational winds to the hitherto shorn woman 's mind , for " we have to provide for all degrees of masculinity in female minds and all degrees of femininity in male minds , as for all the other varieties of human nature . " But , while arguing the just claims of woman upon education , he can not resist giving the women a special scolding for their " docility . " He avers that it is a " tendency of women to be satisfied with half-knowledge . You do n't think of education as a continuous stream , but as little parcels of knowledge , to be forgotten after examinations are over . You 're concerned only with getting by . . . but the teachers are to blame too . So many of us have been dull and dry , unable to arouse the interest of our students . Although I blame the teachers mostly , some of the blame is on you for putting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ' stuffed owls in the Assembly Hail . ' " Neilson 's chief device in education is the creation of an atmosphere in which curiosity , excitement , discussion , dissent tumble over one another . Smith 's atmosphere is a ferment , with Neilson as the continuous catalytic agent . His own tumultuousness pervades the campus , and a sense of life is transmitted to all who come under his eye . The atmosphere which he creates is the clear air in which growing things thrive . He has deep distaste for the esoteric vocabulary of self-conscious scholarship . " Unnecessary hocus-pocus " he calls it . The medical men have their lingo , and now " the sociologists are building up a terrible jargon , though I have yet to find in their books an idea which is not capable of being explained in standard English . " It is an aura in which the bearing of all learning to life becomes clear . " The ranks of scholarship , " he says , " are still crowded with fearful souls who are mining facts in dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance . " He drives home this emphasis to his students , stressing " the close bond between the intellectual life and the moral life , " the virtue of " straight and honest thinking , " the corrosion of " wishful thinking . " He seeks a synthesis of the scientific and the classical , arguing that the quarrel between the scientific group and the classical " persists partly because each has at times been untrue to itself , partly because each has misrepresented the other . . .. The scientist sometimes forgets the honor of his calling and dogmatizes . . . he sometimes degenerates into the mere collector . " But , he continues , " the classical party . . . have come nearer wrecking their own cause than the scientists . . . the foundation of the revolt against the classics is a widespread indignation at being cheated . Hundreds of thousands of students have spent the major part of their studying time for years upon two languages with the implicit understanding that they would finally have access to two great civilizations through reading the records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and energy and at the end they did not get what they paid for . " He assures the exponents of classical education that " the deadly enemy of the classics is not science or mathematics or modern literature or vocational utilitarianism ; it is linguistic fanaticism , the insistence that no one shall enter these fair domains save through the one door of language . . . . It will take several academic generations before we can equip our schools and colleges with teachers who will make classical studies again deserve the name of the humanities . " He is instant in warning against the " too exclusive cultivation of the receptive attitude , " remarks that the non-academic occupations of students are described as " student activities . . . as if the classrooms were merely the scene of student passivities . " He finds in that tendency roots for the " criticism that the American scholar of to-day is more distinguishedfor what he knows than what he thinks . " " In a woman 's college especially , " adds Neilson , " it is necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages of education , the effort should be made to call forth active curiosity as to the meaning and relation of every fact that is taught . " The development of the Smith curriculum under his hand springs from these convictions . There has been a steady movement away from the older classical ideal . Entrance requirements have been simplified , greater latitude of preparation has been accepted , and the older requirement of fuur years of Latin withdrawn . With this shifting of the formal demands for entrance there has gone a steady lifting of standards . " It is a betrayal of our trust , " said Mr. Neilson in his inaugural address in 1918 , " and a cheating of those who have a right to be here to allow our classrooms to be cluttered by the unfit , to tolerate in the academic community those whose presence lowers the moral tone or reduces the intellectual life to mediocri ty . " Smith , under Nellson 's hand , is planned for cultural rather than vocational training . He recognizes that professional preparation and broadening of culture may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in " developing personality and in providing the background and the intellectual aptitude rather than the technical equipment of the expert . " Under his influence , the teaching and the practice of the arts have been given an enlarging place in the Smith curriculum . The arts offer opportunity for expression . The skills acquired in handling a brush or a chisel , in the training of the voice or of the fingers upon the keyboard serve to release creative energy and hence belong in a college course . The handling of words so that sentences and paragraphs convey meaning and beauty falls under the heading of the arts . Neilson was oneof the first college presidents to adopt the " honors " system , under which the gifted student is freed from much required routine during her last two years and is encouraged to develop in those areas in which she reveals individual excellence . Another of Neilson 's enthusiasms is the " Junior year abroad . " Tinder the workings of this plan small groups of qualified students spend a year in France , Italy , Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those countries and appreciation of the cultural gifts of their several peoples . His international sympathy reveals itself also in his numerous choices for the faculty of scholars from overseas . He likes to have men and women who bring the cultural gifts and the spiritual understanding of other nations , and many of his most inspiring teachers have come from France , Germany , Italy , and other countries . He believes that thereby the intellectual and spiritual life of the college is enlarged . These international appointments elicit mixed reactions from the other faculty members . Some have been known to murmur , Yes , Mr. Neilson thinks any foreigner better than any American . And another , without rancor , remarks , " I have n't heard so much broken English since 1/Veber and Fields . " Neilson 's enthusiasm for scholarship is revealed in every page of the Smith record . He has succeeded in rare degree in transmitting to his faculty and to his students his own passion for the gathering and assessing of ideas . He is a scholar in his own right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take out his scholarship in his faculty 's name . The quality of his research on Shakespeare is recognized , his writing on poetry is respected , and he is awaiting retirement to finish his work on Medieval Allegory . In making additions to the faculty he has a record of bringing productive scholars to his campus . But he is fully as assiduous in searching out those who can teach . " The great teacher , " he says , " is almost as rare as the great scholar , and for the undergraduate student is of even greater immediate importance . . . good teachers can usually be found by searching ; greatteachers are the gift of heaven . All we can do is to cherish those we have and hope for more . " IV A college is known by the faculty it keeps . There are divers sorts of faculties . There is the " housebroken " variety in which the several members know what exact corners they belong in , when to sit up and beg , when to play dead . Fear rules such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is the insurgent faculty , in which men and women of intellectual flavorarc in tumult against an autocratic and small-minded president . And then there is the faculty in which teachers of fire and resourcefulness achieve unity through strong leadership . That last is Smith 's . It is possible to detect a certain quizzicalness in Neilson 's attitude toward his faculty . He knows that they are good ? he picked them . He also knows how ignorant an intelligent professor can be , how ludicrous an art teacher can appear when he essays opinions on economics , and how oblivious an economist can be of the finer shadings of the subjunctive . He knows the riotous pigheadedness of the protagonists of each particular cause of education in a faculty , and how each set would gladly close up all the rest of the school and devote the entire endowment to experimentation with white mice or to the teaching of Chaucer . But he has respect for ability , no matter what strange shapes it assumes . When an art professor made requests which seemed altogether unreasonable to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Neilson replied , " No , no , never put anything in the way of genius . " Neilson'swaywith his faculty resembles his way with his students ? it is distinctly on the paternal side . In a lesser man the attitude would stir resentment . With Neilson there is little resentment . Controversies in college faculties are inevitable , especially in a good faculty ; for such will always have its quota of prima donnas . Neilson has his prescription for such : " Put him on a committee . " Neilson can cut the most stubborn knot with a swift thrust of humor . Invariably delivered in kindness , his humor sometimes wounds . There was a case which came before the faculty of a girl who had failed and could not graduate . A deficiency examination must be made up , and the time fixed for such examinations was September . The girl wanted to be married in August . It was an impasse and the rules were explicit . But Neilson urged the faculty that the rules should be waived , that an earlier examination should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she wished . One member of the ? faculty ? of long service and unmarried ? argued , ' ' I see no reason why the rules should be changed to permit a girl to marry ! " Neilson countered , " You would n't . " The rules were waived . Neilson 's conduct of faculty meetings is characteristic . He has a mind which flashes and races . He sees the end of the argument when the issue is stated . He does not hold back his own judgment until others have talked themselves out , nor does he hold decision until others are persuaded . There are some of his faculty who suggest that his course can be and sometimes is on the dictatorial side . But there are few , if any , who carry over any resentment . It takes a man of unusual stature to carry off the parental role as Neilson does with his faculty at Smith . It exacts its peculiar toll of the man who assumes that role . The parent may spank and praise , but he must remain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting room ? and a confessional . His secretary , try as she will , can not protect him . His counsel is sought on such questions as the relative merits of galvanized iron and copper boilers , and where ? and how ? to send sons to college . And , upon occasion , his office becomes an informal court of domestic relations . So it is that , no matter how some professors may differ with him on problems of education , no matter what criticism they may have of his genial father-knows-hest autocracy , there remains little , if any , resentment toward the man . There has never been any question as to Neilson 's stand on academic freedom . " Our tradition , " he wrote in 1927 , " is in favor of complete freedom , and our experience seems to show that such freedom produces loyalty to the college and consideration for its interests . With the writing and speaking of the faculty outside , the College has not concerned itself at all . The question as it has arisen during the present administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are the views of Professor X as proclaimed in his lectures or his books in all respects correct ? ' but Assuming that Professor X 's views may be in part erroneous and to some people offensive , can the College afford to suppress him or his views at the cost of creating an atmosphere of censorship and hampering free thought and free discussion by fear of dismissal ? ' The history of attempts to Limit academic freedom leaves no doubt as to the answer . The greatest universities have been the most tolerant . " Neilson has been faithful to academic freedom . For it has been variously damned by alumnae and outsiders . Any college with Smith 's conservative background would have alumni quick to scent out heresy and treason . The conspicuous test of Neilson 's faith on this score was the case of Harry Elmer Barnes . Barnes was no wild radical , but he was a master of the picturesque phrase . As such , he caught the delighted ear of young women from the sober ranges of the United States . They loved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he shocked their parents . His firing range was wide . In 1926 he published a book on the World War and let Germany off with less blame than was considered orthodox in those unhappy days . Indignant letters poured in upon the president and the trustees . He was accused of pro-Germanism . He was charged with " ignorance of real historical facts , " and of inspiring " disgust among our best classes of citizens , " and it was suggested that Mr. Barnes had received " payment from Germany . " Barnes ' facile pen and ready tongue yielded a stream of quotable ? and misquoted ? sentences upon every subject from the Virgin Birth to the length of skirts . Many of the things reported had never been said , but enough was said and graphically said to keep Barnes forever in the headlines , and Barnes ' enemies forever in the President 's office . But Neilson did not budge . He did not ask Barnes for confirmation or denial . He took his stand that Barnes was a member of the faculty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what he pleased ? as Barnes did . When in 1929 Barnes was offered a journalistic post with the Scripps-Howard papers , Neilson put no pressure on him . If Neilson breathed a sigh of anticipatory relief when Barnes left , he never voiced it publicly . And Harry Barnes retired gracefully , and perhaps gratefully , saying , " If President Neilson would like a little peace of mind during the remainder of his presidency , I would be the last person in the world to challenge his right to it . " There have been other cases when teachers have been under fire and Neilson has stood by . There was Frank Hankins , professor of sociology , in one of whose senior classes a questionnaire relating to marriage and pre-marital relations was prepared by a student , and used by the members of the class . One scared girl showed it to her mother , and the mother shared it with the press . The questionnaire , launched as an honest effort to help a class of serious girls think through an important sociological question , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " nationalization of women . " Neilson dismissed the matter with his board in one sentence , " This is a question of confidence in the administration and does not need to be discussed . " There have been other instances when the real or fancied radicalism of a faculty member has caused passing disturbance , but Smith 's record is clean . No one has been fired for his opinions . There are today on the faculty a full quota of those adjudged radical by one or another of the quaint tests which super-patriots provide , and these " radicals " are the first to assert that never has a hand been raised to limit their freedom of expression . Of course the genuine red-baiter includes Mr. Neilson himself in the list of the undesirables . He has full mention in the redoubtable Mrs. Dilling 's " Red Network , " from which one learns that Neilson has trifled with Russia , blessed sundry organizations standing for civil liberties , and indulged in sundry other " communistic " deeds . Referring to the volume , Mr. Neilson said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . " A college president is known by the honorary degrees which he grants ? and does not grant . Smith 's honorary degrees over a period of twenty years are few in number and chiefly reserved to women . Not one name on the list can be checked , with the mental note added ? Degree given in hope or in payment deferred . If there are a few names which recall memories of family fortune they are names of those who are persons in their own right , their claim not related to inherited wealth . Rather , the list is of women who from the bench , from the stage , from the concert platform , in the laboratory , in the field of social exploration , with the pen , have made themselves felt in American and world life . An examination of the list gives one an eloquent sense of what Neilson asks of life . He has a way all his own with alumni . Alumna , like alumni , belong on the profit and loss ledger ? a little of each . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two purposes ? to give money and to raise trouble when football matches are lost ? fortunately a phenomenon unknown to the college for women ? we never lost a football match . " But , on the other hand , alumni present problems peculiarly their own . They tend to mother their college , and mothering sometimes takes the form of smothering . With these mothering alumna Mr. Neilson takes much the same course that he takes with the daughters . He scolds them . He tells them that after making sacrifices to send the girls to college they then encourage the same girls to get away from college just as much as possible . He reminds them that " college is not a place to rest up between weekends . " At a dinner in New York , in December , 1937 , attended by nine hundred alumna and their husbands , he turned from his discussion of Smith 's problems for an aside on mother love . He assured them that he had no troubles with the students , with the faculty , with the trustees , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mother love , " said Neilson , " I used to regard as one of the beautiful things in the world , but now I am tempted to say , I do not believe in mother love . I think in nine cases out of ten , mother love is self love . Mothers do not want their daughters to fail because it reflects on mother and is socially awkward . " The press gave the story a big spread . This was news . Indignant editorials sprouted . Letters piled in . His friends explained that of course he was joking . He was just having his Scotch fun . But he was scolding too . And , with inevitable exceptions , the alumna liked it . There must be alumna who do not share in the general adulation . I sought long and found just one . Her testimony must be recorded . She cites three incidents to explain her distaste for Mr. Neilson . First , he criticized the girls in her house because " there was no visible number on the front door . " Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such magazines as Redbook and Cosmopolitan , whereas we should read HARPER 'S and The Atlantic Monthly . " And third , " At my fifth reunion , Dr. Neilson . . . made a jolly little speech about making out wills which would leave money to Smith College . " V When William Allan Neilson went to Smith it was with the understanding that he would have nothing to do with the finances of the college , and especially that he would not raise money . Mr. Neilson , one suspects , had observed the ways of college presidents . He had watched their melancholy course as they sniffed out well-filled purses and their divers ways of insinuating themselves into the good graces of bewildered widows . He did not relish that sort of salesman 's job . He had always met the world with candor and did not propose henceforth to walk abroad with the blueprint of a dormitory in his eye . Neilson has kept his word . He has not raised money . He likes to report that only once in twenty-one years has he asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed a hundred letters . When signing them he noted one name of a brother college president , and he added a postscript , " This does n't apply to you . Do n't pay any attention to it . " He gleefully reports that the only gift which resulted was from the man whom he had thus warned . That is Neilson 's money-raising record . So Neilson can welcome an alumna to the Smith campus without wondering whether her husband is making money . He can invite people to dinner without consulting Dun and Bradstreet . But Neilson wanted money for Smith . He wanted dormitories for his girls , a room for every girl . He wanted better buildings . He wanted a more adequate endowment , so that teachers might have better salaries , enough to afford peace of mind , books , travel . He wanted money for scholarships , so that the daughter of poor parents might have a chance in Smith . Neilson early decided that the financial problem of the college had two sides . First , there was the job of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the money on hand go as far as possible . The first he turned over to the alumna . The second he assigned to himself . The alumna have raised money . During the past twenty-one years the endowment has been increased from less than two million to something over six million , and almost five millions have been invested in buildings and grounds . But compared with other colleges of equal standing , Smith has received relatively little money . The substantial gifts which go to men 's colleges are denied the women 's colleges . Neilson finds the explanation for this niggardly treatment of women 's colleges in the fact that " men do not like women to stand up to them and measure them as they are ; they prefer to be on a pedestal ; they prefer to be the possessors of a great deal of wonderful esoteric information . They do n't have much of course ; we know it is mainly bluff ? but it wo n't work any more , and they do n't like it . So the thing to do of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And they have continued to be grudging . Smith , for all its gains in endowment , makes a modest exhibit beside other colleges of equal standing . There is an excellent men 's college near-by which has more than twice Smith 's endowment ? and less than half the students . Neilson did not go after money ? and he did n't get it . But Neilson took on the other side of financial management with avidity . He has seen to it that Smith gets at least two dollars ' worth of value for every dollar spent . Not for nothing had he been born in Perthshire , the son of a poor schoolmaster . And he exhibits an almost hilarious glee that he , a mere teacher of English , has known how to balance a budget . Not only that , but in the twenty years 1917-37 the College has had recurring surpluses totaling one and a quarter millions , which have gone into buildings . As a manager Neilson knows each doorknob and bathtub . He hates waste like a Highland farmer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his finer chapel chastisements . Each building down to every hinge reflects his planning . He knows what will wear and what will return the greatest comfort and usefulness . He knows each flower bed , grass plot , and flagstone walk . Every carpenter , mason , and gardener respects this knowledge . When a bricklayer on the grounds once fell sick he would not stop working . " Why , " he argued , " no one else could do this job , except perhaps the President . " He is as proud of the Treasurer 's report as he is of the honor rolls . When the depression came gifts dropped off , endowment income sank ; he continued to balance the college budget . He did not reduce faculty salaries ? or the wages of scrub women , gardeners , and janitors . All through the depression years Smith paid its bills , made steady improvements , and balanced its books . And Neilson , the Shakespeare specialist , likes to remember that during the dog days of 1930-35 when returns on endowments were dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped not more than 21 per cent . He gives the credit to the excellent financiers who serve on his board of trustees . The trustees aver that more than nine-tenths of the credit for the investment policy of the college belongs to their Scotch president . VI " Never , " remarked Neilson as he returned from an alumnw dinner given in his honor , " never have I heard so many obituaries . " One suspects that he is forever chuckling to himself at the extravagant regard which is showered upon him , and that he knows that he is but the recipient of praise for work done by three remarkable deans , by a sensitive faculty , and by a devoted body of alumni . Akin to Neilson 's modesty is his utter candor . It is obvious that it has never occurred to him that he should impress anyone . He meets each situation and each individual with the directness of a man who has not composed his lines before a glass . " Dr. Neilson , " wrote an alumna , " is candid about everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his confidante , stimulates further among the girls that protective feeling alreadyengendered in their hearts by his small stature , his none too robust state of health , and a certain whimsical wistfulness . " Neilson 's modesty , his candor , and his light touch stem from a vigorous rooting in certain basic attitudes toward life . He is first and last a liberal . In his educational course he has exemplified the disciplines of liberty . He has been a stalwart liberal in his outreach into national and international affairs . Born a British citizen , he is the most stalwart of Americans ; but his sympathies are wide . He was among the first to plead for recognition of Soviet Russia , and has been a persuasive spokesman for the imperiled rights of minorities everywhere . When Massachusetts was pushing Sacco and Vanzetti to the electric chair he was one of the active pleaders in their behalf . When the State required a teachers ' loyalty oath he was quick in protest . He has Iong been an ardent protagonist of civil liberties and an enemy of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American ideal . Neilson 's democracy is ardent and obstinate . When he came to Smith he found more than half the students living off the campus . There were favored houses which lent distinction to those who lived in them , constituting a " gold coast " of social superiority . He set himself to end this situation . He would have no " artificial barrier around some corner , residence in which will bestow on one a glamour which does not belong to one as a person . " He knew that a college should offer the fairest chance for democracy , that in college students " can meet and see each other for four years unhampered by the artificialities of organized socicty . . . Friendship has a free course in that way . " Such an ideal was negated by the system which he found . He did not blame the girls as seriously as he blamed their elder sisters , the alumnae , and their mothers . He would end the situation by providing dormitories , in which all students paid much the same rates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more difficult to create favored cliques . By 1933 every girl lived on the campus . It was his practical victory for democracy . Neilson has a superb restlessness . Master in his own field , then a proved administrator , he has also had time to read widely , to travel , and to participate in educational social and international movements . And for good measure he served as editor-in-chief of the New International Dictionary . The story of William Allan Neilson can not he written apart from the story of Elisabeth Muser Neilson . German-born , still retaining a trace of the accent of Baden , Mrs. Neilson is one of those ample personalities which flow generously over all those whose lives they touch . Her husband 's match in wit , sharing his aesthetic and intellectual enthusiasms , she shares with him the devotion of the many thousands who have trod the Smith campus during the past twenty-one years . Much is written on the failures of education , of the shabby , shoddy things done in education 's name , of the way in which college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college athletics , fraternities , and other strange trivia of the campus scene . Perhaps it will be forgiven if we picture the college as it might be : as a warmblooded living organism in which the life currents flow at the pumping of a strong and eager heart , reaching the last capillary in the last extremity . Such a college will have unity which does not crush individuality , teamwork without servility , mutual regard without obsequiousness , forbearance without denial of candor . In such a college jealousies will be overtopped by the excitements of learning and teaching , and personal piques will be devoured by the enthusiasms of common tasks . Such a college is mirrored only on the retina of hope . But it is for the creation of such a college that presidents must be born . They can not be made . But the tracing of the lines of William Allan Neilson on the story of Smith College gives substance to the faith that education can yet become a regenerative force for democracy in our own times .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
