txt When Miss Marguerite Scholl , Bronx stenographer , stepped from the witness stand in Federal court here this afternoon , Arthur ( Dutch Schultz ) Flegenheimer gave proof that his nerves were a bit overtaxed . The girl 's detailed testimony as to what she saw and heard when she worked in his headquarters at 215 East 149th Street in 1931 , when he was top beer dispenser for the Bronx , left him twisting a scrap of paper between tense and weaving fingers . H. Richard Davis , of counsel for Schultz in his trial on charges of evading payment of $92,000 income tax on $481,63 ? of his beer profits from 1929 to 1931 , attacked the girl 's story for almost an hour , but she stuck to it . She revealed what went on " the Dutchman 's " payroll , how many men worked for him in the Bronx , how they were assigned to districts and pointed at " Dutch " as the man whom she had seen in the offices . If she was afraid , she did not show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the introduction of more than 100 bundles of ledger sheets , ' bank signature cards and deposit slips purporting to show that Schultz and his partners had put close to $2,000,000 in eighteen Bronx banks . The girl 's testimony perked them up . More Deposits Shown . There were more of these slips this morning , for deposits totaling about $30,000 which had been placed in the Bronx branch of the Manufacturers Trust Company under the names of Arthur Flegenheimer , his'mother Emma , and his sister , Helen , wife of the slot machine man known as " Henny Peanuts " because his machines dispensed goobers . His real name is Henry Ursprung . The last of the banker witnesses for the day was W. H. Henlotter of the Manufacturers Trust Company . When he finished court recessed until 1:30 P. M. As the afternoon session began , Dutch , freshly shaved , leaned back in his seat . John H. , chief of government counsel , said : " Call Miss Marguerite Scholl . " As she walked toward the witness stand the men in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eyes narrowed . He seemed to be trying to catch the girl 's eyes as she settled in the chair , but she was not looking his way . Her first few answers were low , and Mr. asked that she keep her voice up . She smiled and nodded . " Where did you work in April , May and June of 1931 ? " asked the prosecutor . " I was working for Wolf &; Yarlas , at 215 East 149th Street , in the Bronx , " she answered clearly . Mr. showed her photographs of George Yarlas ( contrac- tion of Yarlasvetsky ) and Dick Wolf , who have been identified by other witnesses as Dutch 's bookkeepers . " Are these the parties for whom you said you worked ? " " Yes , sir . " " What were your duties ? " " I was stenographer and general office assistant . " " What was the character of the business that was carried on ? " " Auto financing . " " Did Dick Wolf and George Yarlas spend all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , sir . " " Do you know where they did spend most of their time ? " " Up in the fourth floor office . " That is where Schultz 's staff took their beer orders before police raided the plant in June , 1931 . " Did you ever have occasion to call them on the telephone ? " " Yes , sir . I 'd call Bingham 1909 . " That was the line on which the Bronx speakeasy owners put in their requests for beer supplies , according to testimony already in the court record . " Did Mr. Wolf or Mr. Yarlas bring work down with them to-your office ? " " Yes , sir ; they brought books and papers from the office upstairs . " Wrangle Over Police Raid . They used the papers , she testified , to make entries in the books . She identified the account book of the Schultz organization ; she had seen it before , she said . There were other books , too , she volunteered . " Did you see any one make entries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did  --  George Yarlas . " " Did you observe him making entries in this book from other data and information ? " " Yes , sir . " " Do you know where he got that information ? " " From his work upstairs in the fourth floor office . " The defendant seemed to be trying to fix her with his stare , but she kept her eyes on the prosecutor . Defense counsel then were sustained on objections raised to questions concerning a police raid on the offices during her absence . The prosecution then went on . " Do you recall approximately when that visit occurred ? " asked Mr. . " Just before the end of June . " " What happened with respect to your office while you were there ? " " The police took charge when I went back to work . George Yarlas and Jimmy ( the elevator boy ) took packages and records from the safe and from the files . " " Do you know whether those packages were brought from the fourth floor ? " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those books were taken from the office . " Told Police About the Book . Mr. held up the Schultz account book . " Where was this book kept ? " he asked . " In a secret drawer in a desk . " Mr. asked the girl whether she had ever talked with Federal officers about the account book . " I did . About a week afterward I told the authorities about that book . " Schultz leaned forward in his seat so as not to miss a syllable . " After I told the authorities , the officers went back to the office with me and I took a key from a filing cabinet , a bottom drawer , and the book was in a secret compartment . I turned it over to Mr. Keyes and Mr. Tarbell , " she explained . Leo Keyes is head of the government intelligence unit , and Mr. Tarbell was the assistant Federal attorney from whose office some of the evidence was looted two years ago by cracksmen . " Do you know the defendant , Arthur Flegenheimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she answered . The jurymen hunched further forward in their chairs and turned toward the witness . " Can you tell us where he is ? " Girl Identifies Schultz . The girl nodded toward the table reserved for the defense counsel . " The man on the right , the second one , " she said , clearly . Schultz shifted as if he intended to rise , and a wan smile spread across his face . " Did you see him around your office ? " " Yes , sir ; I did . " " How often ? " " About two occasions . " " Tell us what those occasions were . " " The first occasion I was sent home for about four hours and I was told there was going to be a conference . He was right in the room with me . " " What was said to you ? " " Mr. Yarlas told me I could have about four hours off ; that I was n't needed . He said they were going to talk business . " Mr. Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the " occasion " of which she was telling . " It was about two weeks before the raid took place , " she obliged . " His second visit was a week or two later . " " What occurred that time ? " asked Mr. . " I was sent home for the whole day after he came in . " " Who sent you home ? " " Mr. Yarlas . He told me I could have the day off . I had cleaned some adding machines the day before and he was going to give me a break and send me home . " The prosecutor handed a large sheet of ruled paper to Miss Scholl . Mr. Yarlas , she said , would give her records and notations to type on such sheets , adding that he would et the information " from his work upstairs . " " Did you do any other work there ? " " Yes , sir ; I typed the payrolls . " " Do you recall some of the names of the parties on those payrolls ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not work upstairs ; did not know whether it I was a payroll or not . The girl reIgarded him with wide black eyes until the objection was overruled . Names on Payrolls Recalled . " I remember Dick Wolf , " she said , wrinkling her brow in thought . " I remember George Yarlas and Dutch Schultz . ( She stared right at the defendant and he seemed to shake his head in a barely perceptible gesture . ) And there was Stevens and Ahearn ; I 'm pretty sure they were on the payroll sheets . " Stevens and Ahearn , Flegenheimer partners in the beer business , have been missing since they were indicted with him in January , 1933 . Miss Scholl testified that when she called Bingham 1909 she would get " Charley Miller " on the telephone . He was not identified further in the testimony , but it is understood that he sat by the phone taking the speakeasy beer orders . Typed Sheets for Upstairs Office . " Do you know what kind of business was carried on on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked ? " asked the prosecutor . This resulted in new defense objections and Mr. rephrasea his question . " Well , I 'll ask you this : Did you have anything to do with the bills and papers and records of the business upstairs ? Did that give you a knowledge of the business ? " The witness brightened . She typed certain sheets for the upstairs business . " Those sheets , " she explained , " told the number of barrels , and on a different form , the number for each man and the district for each man , from information given to me by Mr. Yarlas . " Mr. Davis complained that the government still had brought forth no proof that the defendant was connected with the place upstairs , but Judge Bryant said he assumed they would . Mr. promised to establish the connection . " Do you know how many employes were on the payrolls upstairs ? " he asked . " About 75 or 100 , " was the quick answer . " Was the telephone made use of by people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used mostly to call upstairs . " " Was that use occasional or gen-eral ? " " Quite frequent , I 'd say . They used to call to find was it all right to go upstairs . They seldom spoke in front of me . " Since " they " were not identified , the answer , at Mr. Noonan 's request , was stricken from the record . Mr. Davis then began the crossexamination . Angered by Talk of Pay . " You did n't quit before this raid , did you ? " " No , sir . " " You had a key and access to this place ? " " Yes , sir . " " When was the first time you talked with any Federal officers ? " " About the end of June , 1931 , or the beginning of July . " " You were still working at that office ? " " Yes , I was . " " Who was present when you turned that book over ? " " Mr. Keyes and Mr. Tarbell . " " Did some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't remember . " It was tack and go for a half hour and the lawyer tried to get the witness to make admissions that she had voluntarily surrendered the book , but her answer was : " I do n't remember . " Some man had come to the office , she insisted , showed her a warrant " or some authority " but she could not remember his name , although Mr. Davis read off the full list of government agents who worked on the case . " Did you ever receive any money from anybody ? " The girl flared . " What do you mean ? " " To testify here ? ' " I had my railroad fare paid . " " Did you get any dresses or gifts from anybody in the employ of the government ? " " No . I did not . " The lawyer went back to his original question . Who was the first man she had talked to ? She did not remember his name . " But you do remember he was a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes and then the session ended . Miss Scholl stepped down smiling . She would not tell reporters her Bronx address , but it was in the Fordham district . Then she left with her mother .
