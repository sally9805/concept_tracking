Texas Rangers were still combing the coulees for cattle thieves and badmen when the Texas Pacific Land Trust was organized in 1888 . Its assets were 3,450,000 acres of Texas land originally granted by the State of Texas to Texas Pacific Railway . Its liabilities were $10,370,000 of certificates issued in a reorganization of that railroad which segregated the land grants from the carrier properties . And its purpose was liquidation . <P> The trustees , however , were in no hurry . After 47 years 1,980,552 Texas Pacific acres are still unsold . Meantime the certificates have sometimes made exciting market history . After oil was discovered near some of the Trust 's vast tracts in 1926 , they touched a high of $3,650 , were then split 100-for-1 , and the new little certificates climbed as high as $40 , equivalent to $4,000 for the old . Currently they are selling around $10 . <P> Though the certificates are traded like a common stock , no investor has ever received one cent in dividends . The trustees have always applied the income from oil royalties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and canceling outstanding certificates . Last week the trustees reported that income last year was up 48% to $458,000 , of which only $41,000 was from land sales . More than half the income was used to buy in certificates . <P> That policy makes Texas Pacific Land Trust a unique investment among liquidating concerns : certificate holders ' proportionate interest in the unsold land increases year after year . Behind each $100 par value of certificates in 1888 were 33 acres of Texas land . Today there are 114 acres behind the same certificates , and the land is much more valuable . Theoretically the time will come when the last solitary certificate holder will own all the land that remains unsold . But one thing will probably prevent that : The trust provides that if 75% of the certificate holders approve , all the property may be liquidated forthwith , the proceeds divided evenly . <P> Other earnings of the week : <P> Red into Black . Radio Corporation of America went into the red in 1932 , was $16.25 in arrears on every share of Class B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a gross income increase of 26% , RCA reported 1934 net profits of $4,249,000 against a deficit of $582,000 the year before . <P> Profitless Prosperity . Anti-New Dealers had a perfect example of profitless prosperity when Chrysler Corp. , reporting 1934 sales at a five-year high of $362,000,000 , announced net profits of $9,534,000 . In 1933 , with $123,578,000 less sales , Chrysler earned $12,129,000 . <P> From Surplus . For the third consecutive year the world 's largest private corporation failed to earn its regular dividend ( $9 ) . American Telephone &; Telegraph and affiliates announced 1934 net income of $5.96 a share ( $111,000,000 ) against $5.38 the year before . The regular dividend had been paid by drawing upon surplus , now $21.50 a share . President Walter Gifford announced that during the year A. T. &; T. had perfected a new telephone which has the bell and other equipment in the telephone itself instead of in a separate box .
