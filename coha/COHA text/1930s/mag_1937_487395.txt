NON-CATHOLICS in America who are not familiar with the ways of the Catholic church and have regarded with dismay the apparent unanimity with which the church is backing the fascist rebellion in Spain should be advised of several important points . They should understand that resort to war by secular authorities does not call for infallible ex cathedra pronouncements . The war in Spain is not a matter of faith or morals . It is a political and social conflict . True there are religious repercussions . But as Jacques Maritain , leading Catholic philosopher , put it : " The war does not thereby become holy ; rather it runs the risk of causing that which is holy to be blasphemed " ( Nouvelle Revue Pranfaise , July , 1937 ) . The political views of the hierarchy , or even of the Pope , are not binding upon individual Catholics . Indeed , it is generally admitted that in the past popes have often been wrong , terribly wrong , in their political decisions . One need only recall Dante 's struggles with Boniface VIII , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church  --  impoverished , bloodless , and anemic , because her priests , her supporters , her bishops were draining her blood , feeding upon her , and growing fat to her loss . The political views of the authorities of the Catholic church are scarcely intelligible unless one remembers that they are men charged with the administration of vast wealth in the form of schools , hospitals , and churches , not to mention real estate and even stock investments . The Vatican was one of Wall Street 's heaviest losers in 1929 . The church has gone into business ; to protect her wealth and her charitable institutions she is forced to compete with other capitalists , to go through the same financial maneuvers ; and she experiences much the same sensations as they do in the face of a rising market or a lower rate of interest . It is not surprising , therefore , that the political outlook of the church should reflect to a certain extent her material interests . " For where your treasure is , there will be your heart also . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It displays far more interest in the preservation of existing social values than in the rooting out of evil ones . As Dom Virgil Michel , Benedictine monk and economist of note , has pointed out , " the injustices suffered by sharecroppers , the gross discriminations against Negroes . . . , economic oppressions of all sorts , crying court injustices , violent vigilante antics . . . go on , with hardly a prominent Catholic voice raised in protest . How the church fathers of old would have made the welkin ring with the righteous indignation of the Lord . . . . They knew of no compromise between Christ and the world " ( Orate Fratres , December 27 , 1936 ) . Sometimes one gets the impression that the church 's activity in the social sphere is confined largely to labeling as Communist anyone who is making a really positive contribution to social progress . For example , John Brophy , director of the C. I. 0. , who is a Catholic and who has a son studying for the priesthood , has been pictured by certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewhiskered agent of Moscow . Father E. Harold Smith , writing in the Commonweal on January 1 , 1937 , warned us that in Europe " the church has lost the working class ; in the United States , she has not lost them  --  as yet . There is very little of a concrete and practical nature to which we can point as the accomplishments of Catholics for social justice " Another writer , in the same Catholic weekly , complained as follows : Hardly a Catholic periodical appears nowadays without at least one vituperative denunciation of communism , and few denouncers seem to know precisely what they are denouncing . I have become painfully aware .. . of our professional denunciators , who throw verbal bombshells against dastardly communism and from cloudy heights fling about quotations from the encyclicals  --  without ever getting down into the streets and actually doing something about them . The old misconception of the church as reactionary is not only not dissolving but adding the picture of her members as platitudinously windy and inert ( February 26 , 1937 ) . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coughlin with his " ballots or bullets " talk , or Brooklyn 's Father Curran , who is able to appear on the same program with " Three-Feet-of-Hose " Harvey and give him a good run for his money . They are extreme cases . But it is a fact that many Catholics pay tribute to the Hearst newspapers for their " signal service " on behalf of " truth and justice " in combating communism . The picture of American Catholic authorities supporting General Franco 's regime in Spain is not very pretty . For if the church in America has not altogether kept clear of the web spun for her by the capitalist system , the Spanish church has not yet resigned herself to the passing of feudalism . European Catholics , by reason of their proximity to the scene of conflict , are perhaps better equipped to recognize this situation  --  and they are not all blind to it . Thus the Austrian Catholic weekly , Chrtstliche Stande.rtaat , has this to say about Spain : The Popular Front government in Spain was a liberal , bourgeois government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uprising . . . . This government was not well liked by the small minority of large landed proprietors because of the division of their land . Nor was it liked by that part of theThe NATION clergy which possessed large agrarian wealth . . . . One should not permit oneself to be deceived by the excesses of an unchained populace in the large cities .. . the Spanish employer is characterized in a manner unique in Europe by his lack of social sense . Today he still misses the good old days of the military dictatorship of Primo de Rivera , who once too often shot down workers out on strike ( March 14 , 1937 ) . And the Jesuit organ , Dossiers de ! ' Action Populaire , last February spoke out with equal frankness : With rare exceptions the Spanish clergy . . . had regrettably neglected social action on behalf of the working class ; even further , through seeking , with a disconcerting . . . lack of conscience , relations . . . of friendship with those privileged by fortune , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the accomplice of capitalist abuses . In view of these sober Catholic interpretations of the Spanish conflict , it seems incredible that His Eminence , Cardinal Goma , Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain , could say , as he did in the London Universe of February 12 , 1937 : It is a war of love for religion against hate for religion . . . . Love of God .. . has put arms into the hands of half the Spaniards . Hate has armed the other half against God . One finds it difficult to put much faith in the pastoral letter of a hierarchy led by the author of so false a statement about the rebels , so uncharitable , so unchristian a statement about the Popular Front government . It would be nice to be able to say that the church in America is siding with the rebels out of naivete and an esprit de corps which knows only that churches were burned and priests killed . Unfortunately , this is untrue . Statements have appeared sporadically in the American Catholic press itself showing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish church were clearly recognized . In August , 1936 , an editorial in Commonweal , which has since become ardently anti-loyalist , declared : Spanish fascism will be the antithesis to the radical social demands made by the revolutionists . Superficially it will also oppose anti-clericalism . . . . But it will not liberate creative Catholic social energies . . . even if it wanted to it could not . George N. Shuster , until recently managing editor ' of the Commonweal , in the issue of April 2 cited Father Ludwig Veit , conservative German historian , to show how the Spanish church had become dependent " upon a state hostile to even elementary demands of social justice , " and characterized the Franco government as " a reactionary militarist regime which has sent Moors to smash ' the organizations of workingmen and peasants . " Father Wilfrid Parsons , S. J. , former editor of the Jesuit weekly , America , wrote in the September , 1936 , issue of Columbia : The great tragedy of Spain was that in the nineteenth century the working classes apostasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destitution , and injustice December 18 , 131 which made them apostasize . They got to hate the church because they hated the friends of the church , who exploited them and whom the church did nothing to rebuke or correct . Father Smith , writing in the January 1 issue of Commonweal , went still farther : For many years now the Catholic church has been the last refuge of . . . those keeping watch at the deathbed of dying social systems . To the poor and the workers in these countries the church has come to be regarded as a vested interest , her bishops landed grandees , and her work to minister to the spiritual needs of those who because they have the means to support her , have also the power to control her . For socially minded and progressive citizens in any country , therefore , to look to the church for aid or guidance in laying the foundations of a more just social order has been made to appear absurd . Non-Catholics should not make the mistake of assuming that all Catholics have lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Catholics in America do not have to go to Spain to know which side is theirs . Most of us found the Spanish pastoral letter very familiar . We have heard the same story so often from our own leaders . It was the same old bogy : Joe Stalin and his cohorts were about to take over the government and exterminate every trace of religion . Remember how they used it to kill the child-labor amendment  --  which even Herbert Hoover supported ? But while thousands of us are openly for the Loyalists , other thousands would like to be for the Loyalists but are afraid . They are not able to distinguish clearly be : tween the political and the religious . They need to be told that they are not repudiating the Church of Christ when they repudiate politically the hierarchy . What is so agonizing is that while the Catholic masses are casting about eagerly and praying desperately for the one thing they lack  --  vigorous , clear-spoken leadership  --  most of those who know the answers to their questions must perforce remain silent . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name to this article would be to commit economic suicide . Even that would not be too bad if only something could be accomplished by it . Too often , however , we have seen Catholics rise in revolt only to fall back again completely discredited . Surely it is a shameful thing that upper-class Catholics have appointed themselves a committee to judge the catholicity of anyone whose truths they are unable to refute . This writer knows how they will reply to her . They will rack their brains to find some small slip , and they will harp on that . But above all they will " smear " her as being a poor Catholic , cowardly and disloyal . These charges are not true . I love the Catholic church . That is why I have spoken up . For I believe that I can best render a service to Holy Mother Church by making it clear to all ? Catholics and non-Catholics alike  --  that the Catholic church is the Church of Christ not because of the tyranny of a corrupt and autocratic hierarchy but in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
