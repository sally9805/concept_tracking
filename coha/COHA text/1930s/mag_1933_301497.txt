Bannered across the front page of the London Evening News one afternoon last week were the headlines : <P> PROHIBITION IS DEAD- THE MORMONS KILLED IT- WHOOPEE- HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN . <P> Underneath was a picture of a man guzzling beer from a keg in a New York bar . <P> The London Star 's headlines squawled : THE DECIDING VOTE BY LATTER DAY SAINTS . <P> Said the Evening Standard : FINAL U. S. STATE VOTE ENDS REIGN OF GANGS . <P> Thus did whiskey-producing Britain greet the 5-to-4 vote by which Utah last week became the 36th Repeal State. * Americans , knowing for some time that Repeal was a certainty , were not excited or much surprised that quiet Utah should have been the deciding State . Pennsylvania and Ohio were the 34th and 35th-Pennsylvania by a majority of 1,000,000 votes , Ohio by 800,000 . Had Utah gone Dry the 36th State would have been Bourbon-producing Kentucky , where Repeal was last week ushered in with violence and bloodshed . <P> More surprising than Utah 's wetness was the fact that North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina by a narrow majority , shrank into the Dry column . <P> The actual execution of Prohibition will take place in Salt Lake City at noon S. M. T. Dec. 5 when the Utah convention meets to ratify . The death chair will be prepared earlier that day . between noon and 1 p. m . E. S. T. by conventions in Pennsylvania and Ohio . <P> In Granite Falls , Minn . Andrew John Volstead received newshawks with his feet on a rolltop desk in his law office . " Anything I might say could do nobody any good , " he said . " All it would do would be just to bring ridicule upon me . If I were to say that Prohibition had been a mistake , there would be an awful uproar . . . " <P> <P> * The 36th State to ratify Prohibition was Nebraska , Jan. 16 , 1919.
