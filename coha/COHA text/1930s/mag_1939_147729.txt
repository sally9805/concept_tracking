War is a great tester of theologies . To consider and try to answer the hard questions Christians ask themselves in war , some Britons lately began The Christian News-Letter . Among them were the Archbishop of York , Lord David Cecil , Catholic Christopher Dawson , Anglo-Catholics T. S. Eliot and J. Middleton Murry , Detectifictioneer Dorothy Sayers , Theologians Nathaniel Micklem and Reinhold Niebuhr . Editor is Joseph Houldsworth Oldham , **28;3497;TOOLONG , leader in the slow-forming World Council of Churches . <P> Last week No. 0 and No. 1 of the News-Letter reached the U. S. Best bit of news : an anonymous article , What Is God Doing ? Its answers : <P> " He is bringing out into the open forces in the world which would eat up the marrow of our life if we were not forced to see their effects in outward conflict . . . . Whatever men may do at least God is answering the prayer : <P> " From sleep and from damnation <P> Deliver us good Lord . . . . <P> " God is declaring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which into actual war is only just suppressed , is not true peace . Mere absence of war is not His will for us nor our greatest good . . . . <P> " God is showing us in the policies we are resisting where men get to when they reject the Christian belief in God as Creator and Judge . . . . Violence and terror come then to be regarded as the indispensable means of the maintenance and continuance of a society which puts its own political exaltation in place of the divine law . . . . But God is showing also that this idolatry of political power which we see in the enemy is a reaction from a more disguised but not less real idolatry of commercial and financial values that has deeply infected the democratic peoples . <P> " God is breaking up through the war a number of artificial forms of organization and social tendencies which , if left undisturbed , would either destroy man or hinder the achievement of his full growth . A social worker is reported to have said before the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a war would be to destroy half of London , including its slums , and scatter its population over the country , it might not be a wholly bad thing . . . . God is ... putting to us a searching question . Money can be found in any quantities to discharge shells gratis to the enemy ; shall we again be fobbed off with the plea of poverty when the more modest demands of social decency again become clamant ?
