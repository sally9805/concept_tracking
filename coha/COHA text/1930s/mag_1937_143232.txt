If there is one thing particularly enjoyed by Arizona 's florid , courtly Henry Fountain Ashurst , it is disseminating bits of the complex philosophy he has acquired in his 25 years in the U. S. Senate . Last week Senator Ashurst had a characteristically involved witticism to deliver . Said he : " In times of classical antiquity there were two things unpredictable : the way of a man with a maid , and the way of an eagle on a rock ( which way it will fly ) . " The last decade , according to Senator Ashurst , has added another equally profound human uncertainty : " What will Congress do ? " <P> In Washington this week , the 24th Special Session of Congress in U. S. history convened under circumstances to which Senator Ashurst 's remark was peculiarly pertinent . When Franklin Delano Roosevelt last month called the Session to deal with a five-point legislative program , the U. S. was , relatively speaking , economically content . The five weeks since have been just long enough to include the first serious decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities for controversy already foreseen for the special session , the slump added another . This week , when Vice President Garner in the Senate and Speaker William Bankhead in the House thumped their gavels for the first time since last August 21 , they were as uncertain as the rest of the U. S. what the session would bring forth . First thing it brought forth was a message from the President . <P> Read to both Houses by their clerks , the message started with a discussion of the business recession and legislative means toward ending it . Said the President : " The fundamental situation is not to be compared with the far different conditions of 1929 . . . . Obviously an immediate task is to try to increase the use of private capital to increase employment . . . . Private enterprise , with co-operation on the part of Government , can advance to higher levels of industrial activity than those reached earlier this year . . . . Such advance will assure balanced budgets . . . . If private enterprise does not respond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of taxes , the President in effect reiterated what his Secretary of the Treasury had said a few days earlier ( see p. 16 ) , in proposing to remove " unjust provisions . " He also warned that " modifications adequate to encourage productive enterprises , especially for the smaller businesses , must not extend to the point of using the corporate form for the purpose of hiding behind it . " Almost simultaneously with the reading of the President 's message , the House Ways and Means Sub-Committee on taxation agreed to exempt corporations with net incomes of $5,000 or less from the undistributed profits tax . <P> In his fireside chat last month , the President called for the " early enactment " of laws to 1 ) control crop surpluses , 2 ) regulate wages and hours in industry , 3 ) reorganize the executive branch of the Government , 4 ) permit regional planning for better use of national resources , 5 ) modernize anti-trust legislation . In his message this week , he again enumerated the first four , omitted the last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
