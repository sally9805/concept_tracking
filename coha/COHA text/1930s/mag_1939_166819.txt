( See Cover ) <P> Early in 1914 two royal matchmakers-Nicholas II , last Tsar of All the Russias , and Marie , then Rumania 's British-born Crown Princess-put their heads together and decided it would be nice for both their countries if Marie 's elder son Carol and Nicholas ' eldest daughter Olga were to marry . To push the romance along , Marie and her husband , Crown Prince Ferdinand , took Carol on a trip to Tsarkoye Selo , the Tsar 's winter palace outside St. Petersburg , and later His Imperial Majesty &; family visited the Rumanian royalty at Constantsa , on the Black Sea . <P> Important hitch in the plan , however , was that Prince Carol , who after all had to do the proposing , balked . Then 20 years old , for five years he had been allowed by indulgent parents to taste the pleasures of Bucharest , and already he was beginning to show decided independence in his choice of women . Instead of making up to the rather plain , high-cheek-boned Grand Duchess Olga , he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tatiana , the Tsar 's second oldest daughter . Since this was not on the schedule , the matchmakers called the whole affair off , and His Imperial Majesty at length showed his distaste not only for Carol but for the entire Rumanian royal family by coining one of his very rare epigrams : " Rumania , bah ! It is neither a State nor a nation , but a profession . " <P> But the choosy Balkan Prince had the last laugh on the proud Emperor of Holy Russia . By 1918 Nicholas Romanov had lost his job and his life : by 1930 not only was Carol Hohenzollern very much alive , but after four-and-a-half years of self-exile , he was back in Bucharest and able truthfully to describe his profession to Rumania 's census-takers as " mostly a king , " secondarily a " farmer .

The old " Playboy of the Balkans , " now 46 , runs a country of 20,000,000 people whose 113,884 square miles , rich in oil and cereals , are not only the most prosperous in their part of the world , but the most coveted by grabby neighbors . <P> Of four nations that border on Rumania 's frontier ( Russia , Hungary , Yugoslavia , Bulgaria ) only Yugoslavia can be considered as definitely friendly . The U.S.S.R. has never given up its claim to Bessarabia on the east , and last week Rumanians feared that as soon as Joseph Stalin was through talking with Finnish statesmen , he would send for King Carol 's Minister of Foreign Affairs , Grigore Gafencu .
