EARL WHITEHILL was pitching and Babe Ruth was at the bat . Clarence Rowland was the umpire behind the plats . When the third strike was called , the Babe hurled his bat into the air with vicious disgust and growled something to Rowland . A bloodthirsty roar went up from the fans , who had been riding Rowland all afternoon . They did n't know what the Babe had said , but whatever it was , they were for him , and in no uncertain terms they urged him to vent his wrath on the umpire in some swift and violent . manner . The fans raised such a rumpus over the incident that my curiosity was aroused . After the game I went to the umpires ' dressing room and asked Rowland what the Babe had threatened to do to him . Rowland laughed . " The fans had it all wrong , " he said . " The Babe was n't sore at me . That strike curved over the plate at the last moment , as pretty as anything , and that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarence , where 'd that bird get a hook like that ? He never showed me one like that before . ' " Another time , Dolly Stark was behind the plate and 15,000 fans at the Polo Grounds were rooting for Mel Ott , slugging Giant outfielder , to crack one of the left-handed slants of Ed Brandt , of the Boston Braves . But when the ball landed in Catcher Hogan 's mitt , Dolly called a strike . Ott stepped out of the batter 's box , turned toward the stands and said something to the umpire . The fans went wild : " That 's the boy , Mel ! You tell the big bum ! Do n't let that blind guy get away with it ! " But after the game , when I asked Dolly what Ott had said , he grinned : " Oh , nothing much . Mel knew that one was through the middle , and he said , ' Dolly , I 'd give five dollars to have that one back again . ' " Nine times out of ten when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umpire there is n't anything to get excited about . The player is n't squawking at the umpire , but beefing about his own tough luck . Even so , umpires always have been , are now and always will be , I suppose , a natural prey for the fans . The fans , however , are n't so violent as they used to be . Nowadays , they are usually satisfied to discharge their venom in verbal abuse . But not so many years ago they took the game a good deal more seriously , and it was common for an umpire to have to sprint across the diamond , with a mob chasing him , and scramble over the fence to escape bodily harm . The Forgotten Men of Baseball I REMEMBER an occasion when Clarence Row- land had to hide in the umpires ' dressing room until be got a chance to sneak out of the runway . Another time Billy Evans was knocked out by a pop bottle and taken to a hospital . Red Ormsby also was once knocked out by a pop bottle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in danger of being mobbed , a policeman rescued him and conducted him safely to the dressing room . Red started to thank the cop for saving him , but the cop gave a withering look : " Do n't thank me , mister . I learned long ago always to help the blind . " But for all the abusive attention they receive from the fans around ball parks , when they are away from the diamond umpires are the forgotten men of baseball . Except for justices of the Supreme Court , I know of no other class of men whose occupation requires them to lead such a lonely existence . An important part of the picture as long as the game is in progress , as soon as it is over they are out of the limelight . Tradition requires that they stay at a different hotel from the players , with whom they must never hen r in the room is Big ' s gold watch going ' ' ie k- tie k-tie k , " and Wally Jones ' breath going " Minh-Minh-hunh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket and opens a drawer of his desk . Ile takes out the two prepared cheek books and a pile of large bills . He shoves these across at Wally Jones . " 0 . K. , " he says . " Scram ! " N OW , it is true that seven hundred and twenty grand to guys like Sonny Ruyeross and Big Jim , who own millions , is just a flash in the pan , or , as the U. S. Government puts it , e plaribus anuirt . But take this Wally Jones . Here is a tomato who works on the night trick of a newspaper and probably never gets more than fifty bucks a week in his life . Here is a. guy who talks about big dough the same . way a Minnesota truck farmer talks about South America . He has heard about it , but never seen it . Here is a palooka who does most of his spending in second-rate saloons and five-and-ten-cent stores . Well , here he is with the chance of a lifetime  --  the chance to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Naturally , he is as bopped up as a young kangaroo , and 1 have all 1 can do to tag him , once we hit the sunlight on Broadway . Fifty grand in his pocket ! Batik credit for six hundred and seventy more He is out to buy , and buy fast . What he is going to buy , be is too excited to know yet . But the town is wide open . A greasy street hawker , shoving a pushcart , attracts his attention . On the cart is an assortment of safety pins , shoe laces , handkerchiefs , and whatnot . Wally rushes over and grabs up a handf ul . " How much ? " he yells . " Well , " says the pushcart peddler , " for you , fifty cents . " " What ? " he bellows in disgust . " You can have it for a quarter , " says the pushcart peddler . Wally does not even bother to answer . He throws down the sturi and gallops away . The pushcart peddler shakes his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is like I told you , Harry , " he says . " People just ai n't buying . " I do not hear any more of this because I am busy chasing the Jones boy . After three hectic blocks , he conies to a quick stop on the corner of Broadway and 46th Street and roves his eyes in a circle . Across the street is a row of stores  --  a men 's suit shop , an auction joint , a soft-drink stand and a movie theater . It does not take him long to realize that these are out of the question . If he is going to spend a thousand dollars a minute , he must spend it in the places that wil i do the most good . That is apparent . The first stop , therefore , is Larne 's , in Fifth Avenue . Wally corners the manager  --  a little black-haired guy named Peters  --  and opens up with a request for the highest-pticed piece of jewelry in the place . Peters is at first not altogether enthusiastic and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he changes his mind in short order after telephoning Sonny 's broker , and fifteen minutes later we walk out with a bill of sale fora string of matched pearls costing one hundred thousand dollars . Well , this is pretty good going . A hundred grand at the rate of a grand a minute represents a hundred minutes , and , since it is only 9:30 , we are already ten minutes ahead of schedule . By this time , too , Wally has an inspiration . Everybody knows that private yachts run into heavy sugar and he figures that he ought to he able to get rid of something substantial along these lines . With this in mind , we rush into a drug store and hunt . up the word " Yachts " in a classified telephone directory . There are a couple of names listed under " Yachts  --  see shipbuilders , " but this is definitely aut . We have no time to wait until a yacht is built . We select , therefore , an establishment called H. J. Davidson , Inc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a broadloom carpet in the salesroom . Wally does not go through any preliminaries . He grabs the first clerk he sees and wants to know what is tops he can pay for a. yacht . " Why , " says the clerk , shrugging , " we could sell you a yacht for two million dollars . " " You can ? " says Wally , letting out a grin wide enough to run a truck through . " Certainly , " replies the clerk . " There is no limit to what you can pay for a yacht . Were you interested in buying one ? " " Yes , indeed , " says Wally , coming down to earth . " But two million is More than I have to spend . Could you offer me a cheaper yacht ? " " Of course , " says the clerk . " Airy amount you desire . A Million ? " " No-o " says Wally . " Let its say approximately six hundred and twenty thousand . " " Well , " says the clerk , stroking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think we have one for exactly that figure , but I can offer you an excellent buy at seven hundred thousand . This is Mr. John Morrison 's Duchess . Mr. Morrison has listed it here for disposal . " Wally is thinking fast . In order to buy this yacht , he will have to give back the matched pearls . But this is a wise move , because it will leave him with a small matter of twenty grand on his hands . " 0 . K. , " he says finally . " I will take that yacht . " " Splendid , " says the clerk . " You will not regret it . Now just let me have your address and telephone number , and I will call you back in the early part of next week . " " Next week ? " explodes Wally . " Are you crazy ? I want , the yacht now  --  right away . Make out a bill of sale . " " I am afraid I could n't , " says the clerk . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only brokers . Mr. Morrison must approve the sale , " " Well , what is stopping him ? " says Wally . " He is out of town at present , " replies the clerk . " But we expect him back on Tuesday , " " Tuesday is too late , " says Wally . " I am in a hurry . How about another yacht ? " " Well , " says the clerk thoughtfully , " Mr. Carl Watkins , of Montclair , has placed his Cynthia in our hands . Would you care to make an appointment for tonight ? " " No ! " yells Wally . " I do not want to make appointments ! I want a yacht right now ! " " But surely , " says the clerk , " even if you did buy one now , you could not expect to take it for an immediate cruise . " " Who said I want it for a cruise ? " " But  --  but " Listen , " says Wally heatedly , " what I want a yacht for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell me one , or aren't. you ? " " Why , " says the clerk , glancing quickly at his book , " it will make me very happy . Let me see . There is Mr. Gordon 's Lycoma for six hundred and fifty thousand . " " Yes ? " pants Wally . " Yes , " says the clerk . " But Mr. Gordon is in Palm Beach . And there is Mr. Harrison 's White Swan for five hundred thousand . Would you be interested in a white yacht ? " " My good man , " says Wally , trying to control himself , " I do not care if it is a white yacht , a red yacht , a green yacht or a pink yacht . with ribbons on it . All I want is a yacht , I want it right , away . I am in a hurry , see ? I can not waste time . I am trying to spend a thousand dollars a minute , and already I am here forty-five minutes and have not spent a plugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Morrison 's yacht or Gordon 's yacht or Harrison 's yacht , let me have a yacht that you can get rid of fast . " Well , after much hemming and hawing and consulting and telephoning and looking up records , it develops that the only yacht H. J. Davidson , Inc. , can sell on the spot is a neat but not gaudy vessel , priced at a hundred and twenty-five grand . And the only reason they can make such a quick turnover is because they happen to . own the yacht outright . The price , of course , is not up to Wally 's hopes , but by this time he is very thankful to get out of H. J. Davidson , Inc. , with anything . And in this he is not to be blamed because , no matter how you look at it , a yacht in the hand is worth two dozen in Palm Beach ; and especially when you are trying to spend a thousand dollars a minute . So he hands over a check , accepts a bill of sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lithuanian taxicab driver , is waiting . The next stop is the Conklin Realty Company in 34th Street , and in this joint we waste almost a full hour before Wally succeeds in buying a one-hundred - and - fifty - thousand - dollar mansion , the most expensive private home they have listed . This is bought , of course , only after I look up the rules and conditions to make sure that a private home is a , legitimate purchase ; and when I announce that it is , Wally is all for running out to another real-estate office to see if he can close a bigger deaf , and the only thing that stops him is a salesman named Dilley , who insists that lie probably could not do better elsewhere on such short . notice . From a home and a yacht , it is one stop to an automobile ; and from an automobile , it is one more step to an airplane . These two purchases  --  a **27;727;TOOLONG imported Rolzinor and a fifty-thousand-dollar Torsky Amphibian  --  are soon added to our collection of knickknacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wally is very excited . " Look , Benny , " he says , holding out his bills of sale . " I am the owner of a private home , a private yacht , an automobile , an airplane and a string of pearls . " " So what ? " I shrug , trying to look as if this is nothing . " So what ? " he repeats , astonished . " Do you realize that it is only 12:30 and already I have spent four hundred and fifty grand ? Do you realize that this puts me practically three hours ahead of schedule ? " I say , " that certainly is pretty good . " " Where to , boss ? " interrupts Pete Sebastian from his taxicab . But Wally does not answer . Instead , I see him casting come-hither eyes at a delivery cart that is bumping past . I immediately put in an objection . " No , " I say , shaking my head . " You can not buy a wagon . A wagon is a wheeled conveyance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Wally coldly . " I am not looking at the wagon . I am looking at the horse . A horse is not a wheeled conveyance , is it ? " " No , " I am forced to admit . " Well , where can I buy a horse fast ? " " What kind of a horse ? " I counter . " Whichever kind costs the most , " ho says . " Well , " I reply , " there is no doubt that race horses run into money . " " A smart word , " says Wally . " We will purchase the best racing animal in town . " Well , right here is where I get interested . When he talks about . race horses , he talks about something that is my meat . It is true that I am not supposed to make any suggestions , being , in a sense , just a referee , but it happens that a very good friend of mine named New Deal Watson is the owner of an expensive race horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no wrong , I tell myself , in helping out a friend  --  especially as this Wally Jones is going to purchase a race horse from somebody and he does not much care who it is . So , with this comforting thought , I open up in the following fashion : " Wally , " I say , " if it is a race horse you are interested in purchasing , I know just the man for you . He is a good friend of mine and his name is New Deal Watson , " " Lead me to him , " says Wally , and we hop into Pete Sebastian 's taxicab . By a slab of good fortune , we catch New Deal just as he is leaving for the track . " New Deal , " I say , " this is my friend , Wally Jones , who is interested in purchasing your race horse , Black Duke . " " When ? " asks New Deal . " Right away , " says Wally . " how much are you asking ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deal . " Tonight is too late , " Wally argues . " I must buy him right away . " " Well , " says New Deal , " here is the point : Black Duke is entered in the Beaumont Posterity , which is a **26;756;TOOLONG stake and is being run off this afternoon . " " Has he any chance of winning ? " Wally asks . " Frankly , " says New Deal , " very little . But today 's race will give me a good idea of his value in other stakes and I will be better able to name a price . " " I will name one , " says Wally . " Twenty-five thousand  --  the price of the Beaumont Posterity . " New Deal blinks and almost swallows his tongue . " Are you serious ? " he croaks . " I am , " says Wally . " Make out a bill of sale and I will take Black Duke off your hands . " Well , New Deal almost falls over himself scribbling a quick turnover , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good friend of mine and his nag will probably not earn twenty-five grand in three years . " Thanks , pal , " says New Deal , when Wally has counted out twenty-five grand in cash . " I hope , for your sake , that . Black Duke finishes in the money . " " I hope , for any sake , " says Wally , " that he does n't . " III 4:30 in the afternoon we have 1. ) zigzagged through the town so many times my tongue is hanging out and nay legs are beginning to fold up . This business of spending a thousand dollars a. minute for twelve hours may sound , offhand , like a cute pastime , but , take it from me , after eight and a half of these hours without even a cup of coffee , I will gladly exchange this pastime for a nervous breakdown . Wally has been going like a house on fire and picking up new ideas rapidly , and our list of Christmas presents soon takes on the appearance of a national inventory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that our hills are hitting around the five-hundred - and - ninety- five - thousand - dollar mark . And right here is where things begin to get serious . Up to now , Wally 's ideas have come with no great amount of brain work . But at five o'clock , with a matter of one hundred and twenty-five grand to go , he begins to discover that the job ahead of him is not altogether a bed of roses . In the first place , most of the big items have already been knocked oil and , no matter how hard lie tries , he can not think of anything which will cost in the neighborhood of a hundred grand , or fifty grand , or even twenty-five grand . In the second place , he has only three hours left , and anybody but a dunce can see that there is no percentage in spending a grand here and a grand there , because a grand , after all , is just a drop in the bucket compared to a hundred and twenty-five thousand , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on small fry . We are speeding back into the city from a guy 's home in Riverdale where we close the last transaction . Wally 's face is pale and he is chewing nervously on the end of a pencil . He is trying . to figure out an idea for the next purchase , Wontleaed on Page 481 46 THE SATURDAY IContinued front Paso 43 ) but is gelling exactly nowhere . And nowhere at the rate of a thousand dollars a. minute . Well , 1 have heard about guys going nuts trying to make an honest dollar , but WWI ' do I see a man so desperate to get rid of money . Indeed , it is a heartbreaking situation . Here is Wally with a. hundred and twenty-five grand in his pocket and three full hours in which to unload it , and the only thing he is spending is twenty cents a mile by the taxicab meter . Every two minutes he runs a wild hand through his hair and , for want of something better to do , yells at Pete ' Sebastian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliging fellow , whether he knows where he is going or not , steps on it . Well , that ride is something I will never forget . We shoot down the Grand Concourse and hit into Park Avenue at . exactly twenty minutes after five , and Mrs. Sebastian 's son up front is doing a man's-sized job of traffic dodging . He is cutting in and out of lanes like a fire engine answering a call and passing enough red lights to spend the rest of his life in jail under the Baumes Law . In fact , when we reach 63d Street , I all hanging on to the side strap and wondering where I ever get the courage to remain in the cab so long , when this is what happens : Pete suddenly sees an opening on his left and cuts quickly out of his lane to grab it . What he does not see , however , is the blue roadster coming up fast in the other lane and , before you can say Hoboken , there is a loud crash and the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next thing I know , I am gazing peacefully up at a hospital ceiling and somebody is holding my hand . I figure that this is either Wally Jones or Pete Sebastian . Then I remember about the accident and I decide that it is maybe a doctor or a nurse . My mind is clearing fast now and I glance around ; whereupon I let out a gasp . The person that is holding my hand is no less than an angel . " Oh ! " says the angel . " Thank heavens you are coming to ! I shall never forgive myself if anything happens to you or your friend . " " Where am I ? " I ask . In the Eastview Hospital , " says the angel , who , by now , is taking on the appearance of a very beautiful girl . " My ear sideswiped your taxicab and turned it over . Now please close your eyes and try to get some rest . " Well , I figure that this is not such a bad idea , and I heave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear the sound of a rumpus in the adjoining bed . " Let me go , " says a voice . " I tell you I am 0 . K. " " There , " says another voice . " Of course you are . Now just relax , " I glance around to catch the doings , and there is Wally Jones . his head wrapped up like a pound of hamburger , wrestling with a couple of doctors . " I wo n't relax ! " Wally yells . " I have no time to relax ! I am trying to spend a thousand dollars a minute ! " " Certainly , " says the first doctor , pushing against his chest . " We understand . " " Then let me go ! " Wally cries . " There is no time to he lost ! I have already spent five hundred and ninety-five thousand dollars ? " " Sh-h ! " says the second doctor . " Your nerves are on edge . Just drink this and you will sleep . " EVENING POST " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 want to get out of here ! " And with that , he starts to wrestle like a , veteran grunt-arid-groan boy at the arden . At this point the door opens and a third doctor enters . There is a puzzled look on the newcomer 's face and he motions to his colleagues and goes into a quick huddle . " It is true , " he whispers . " We have examined his clothing and found twenty-five thousand dollars in cash and bills of sale for five hundred and ninety-five thousand more . " " But we can not let him go , " says the first doctor . " He is in no condition to leave the hospital . If anything happens , we will have an investigation on our hands and I , for one , will not take the responsibility . " " You do not have to , " says the third doctor . " Mr. Crumley , the president , is on his way up . " And as if in answer , the door opens again and a short man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Wally Jones shouts from the bed . " I would like to get out of here ! " The short ? man with the red beard sticks up a hand . " Please do not excite yourself , Mr. Jones . We understand your situation , but we can not permit you to leave the hospital . However , " he adds , " as you are a man of means , I have given orders that you be transferred to a private ward . " " Keep your private ward , " says " I am a citizen and a taxpayer , and if I do not wish to stay in a hospital ? " " Please , " says President Crumley with firmness . Well , it does not take Wally long to realize that threats and yelling are going to avail him nothing , so he changes the subject abruptly . " Listen , " he says . " If you will not let me go , maybe you can sell me something ? " " Sell you something ? " repeats the red beard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will buy anything in the place at any price . " " Well ? " says the red beard uncertainly . " Name your own figure , " Wally pants . " I am in no position to quibble . It is half-past six and I must buy , and buy fast . " " Well ? " says this Crumley . Of course , the property of Eastview Hospital is not for sale , but ? " But what ? " " But if you are really interested in purchasing something substantial , I could make a suggestion . " " Make it , " Wally croaks . " Well , " says Crumley , pulling at his beard , " it is like this : At the present moment the funds and resources of Eastview are very low and , as in all great institutions , we need equipment and materials to carry on our work . " " Yes ? ' ' says Wally . " Yes , " says Crumley . " In fact , we have recently opened a new ward for the care and treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very wealthy man , and , from what your chauffeur , Mr. Sebastian , tells me , something of a philanthropist . Otherwise , I would not make this suggestion , But it happens that there is a gentleman in my office right now who is willing to part with a gram of radium for one hundred thousand dollars " A hundred grand ? " says Wally , and his face lights up like a seventy-watt bulb . January 26 , Ci3.1 Cruruley nods . " As I say , we need this valuable element to carry on our great work in the field of cancer , and I thought perhaps you would care to purchase this radium and lend it to the hospital . " " Say no more , " says Wally . " Bring me a bill of sale and I will make out a check . " The red beard stands up . " Thank you , " be says . " You are a public-spirited citizen and I shall suggest your name for our board of ? " " Never mind , " says Wally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this transaction is a very fortunate break , indeed , because it brings his total up to six hundred and ninety-five thousand , and he has only a small matter of twenty-five grand to get rid of in more than an hour . But it is obvious that he can not spend this money in a hospital bed , and he is all for starting another free-for-all with the three doctors , when this girl who has been holding my hand intervenes . She goes over to Wally and puts her fingers on Ins forehead . " Your poor , poor boy , " she says . Wo n't you please try to rest ? " " Listen ? " says Wally , but he gets no further . He is staring up at the girl and swallowing hard . " Please , " says the girl , stroking his face . " I understand just how you feel , but , of course , the doctors know what is best . " " Of course , " murmurs Wally dreamily . " And if they say that you must remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wally nods with a rapt expression . " Oh I " says the girl , her voice . catching . " I feel so terrible about the whole thing . The accident , I mean . It was all my fault . " " No , " says Wally , his eyes shining . " You must not blame yourself . " " It is sweet of you to say that , " the girl cries . " Sweet of you . " And , in a burst of feeling , she bends over and kisses Wally smack on the cheek . Well , naturally , I am not in a position to tell you what goes on in Wally 's mind when this takes place . Maybe it is a far-away picture of marriage and little children . Maybe it is a picture of a happy cottage with flowers growing all around and sunshine splashing through the windows . And maybe , along with this picture , comes a recollection of his fifty-dollar-a-week job and the ten grand he stands to collect if he unloads the balance of his money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and starts to yell about buying things . The girl tries to hold him and the doctors rush over to help , and pretty soon the place is once more a madhouse . Now , as I mentioned before , this room we are in is a public ward and there are other patients trying to get an honest sleep ; and , while Wally is yelling about buying things , there is a fellow in the next bed who is getting more and more disgusted . Finally he can not control himself any longer and he leans up on an elbow . " Listen , " he says to Wally coldly . " You will do us all here a very great favor if you would go out and buy yourself a coffin . " That is all he says , but , in the silence that follows , you can practically heat ' a feather drop , Wally is staring at the guy like a pardoned convict , and there is on his face a mixture of admiration and awe . " A coffin , " ho whispers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that word , " the girl shudders . But Wally is paying no attention . He is figuring to himself and noddinv his head . Suddenly he turns and points a finger at the girl . " Cun I trust you ? " he says . " Certainly , " replies the girl . " Well , then , " he says , " I would like you to go out and buy me a coffin . " " Oh , " says the girl , " I could not do that . It is too horrible . You must not talk about dying . " ? " I am not talking about dying , " says Wally . " All . I want is a coffin  --  a silver-and-gold-inlaid coffin that will figure to cost maybe twenty-five grand . The Drakeley Funeral Parlor is still open and will probably have something in that order . " " No , " says the girl miserably , " I will not do it . I could not bring myself to buy you a coffin . " " Listen , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump out of bed and buy it myself . This is straight from the shoulder . All I have left out of seven hundred and twenty thousand is twenty-five grand in cash . Will you buy me a coffin , or wo n't you ? " The girl looks at him and her chin is quivering . " Very well , " she says softly , I will buy you a coffin . " " Thank you , " says Wally . " And I will ask another favor . Please come back here with the bill of sale before eight o'clock . " When the girl is gone , I turn to Wally and say in my most polite tone of voice : " Excuse me but do you happen to know this girl 's name ? " " No , " he says . " Do you happen to know where she lives ? " " No , " he says . " Do you happen to know anything about her ? " " No , " he says . " That is very nice , " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dame twenty-five grand in cash ? " " Well , " says Wally , " she has a very sweet face . " And with that he closes his eyes and leans back . Now , I am not the sort of fellow who looks for the worst in people . In fact , my motto is like the Bible says : " Let him who is without sin cast the first stone . " But when it gets to be half-past seven and there is no sign of either the girl , the coffin or the twenty-five grand , I am beginning to have a few qualms . And so is Wally Jones . We have already notified Big Jim that we can not be in his office for the payoff and that he should come down and meet us in the hospital , and at the present moment he and Sonny Ruycross are on their way over . It is very quiet in the ward as the minutes slip hy , but the tension is terrific . Wally is biting a fingernail and keeping his eyes fastened on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every time there is a noise , he holds his breath and looks for the girl to come in . But she does not come . At ten minutes to eight his face is the color of shaving-cream lather . At five minutes to eight he is desperate , but still hoping . At one minute to eight he is leaning over the edge of the bed , and I suggest that he lay down or he will split a blood vessel . Finally it is eight o'clock . Wally does not say a word . He leans back on the pillow and folds his arms . And just then the door opens and Big Jim Papalino comes in , followed by Sonny Ruycross . " Well ? " says Big Jim , slamming a folded newspaper into the palm of his hand . " What is the situation ? " Wally shakes his head tiredly . " I am twenty-five thousand short , " he says . " Ha-ha , " laughs Big Jim . " Just as I expected . I know what I am doing when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ituyeross and sticks out his hand for the cheek . But Wally stops him . " Wait , Jim , " he says slowly . " The bet is off . " " Off ? " says Big Jim . " What do you mean  --  off ? " " I mean , " says Wally , " that under the circumstances you can not collect the bet . " " And why ca n't I ? " Big Jim demands . " It is not my fault if you wind up in a hospital . We picked you to spend the money , and you are supposed to have bills of sale for seven hundred and twenty thousand , or else I win . " " Technically , " says Wally , " you are correct . But , fundamentally , you are wrong . Your bet was that a than can not spend a thousand dollars a minute for twelve hours . Well , I have proved that it can he done . " " How ? " says Big Jim , more puzzled than mad . " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand short ? " " Yes , " says Wally . " But , as far as I am concerned , the money is spent . I sent a girl out to buy me a coffin . " " A girl ? " says Big Jim . " What girl ? Where is she ? " . " That , " says Wally , " is something would like to know . I gave her the money in cash . " " In cash ? " Sonny Ruycross cuts in . " Do you mean that you gave a total stranger twenty-five thousand dollars in greenbacks ? ' " I am sorry , " says Wally . " She had a very sweet face . " Well , this is too much for Big Jim . He is , all in all , a good sport and willing to concede that the bet might be off , but the idea of a bonehead giving twenty-five grand to a skirt that he does not know is against all his principles . He sits down on the edge of my bed and glares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make ninety-nine out of a hundred Broadway heels throw a hemorrhage . The newspaper is still in his hand and , quite by accident , k happen to catch a glimpse of something which makes me let out a roar . Grabbing the newspaper , I open it quickly and read the following head-line : BLACK DUKE WINS BEAUMONT POSTERITY LONG SHOT COMES UP FAST IN CLOSING SECONDS TO NOSE OUT FAVORITES FOR RICH BEAUMONT STARE " Holy Moses ! " I say , and toss the paper over to Wally . He reads it carefully , and then looks up . " Jim , " he says , " the Beaumont Posterity is worth twenty-five grand  --  right ? " " Right , " says Big Jim . " Very well , " says Wally . " Then we are even . " " Even ? " " Yes , " says Wally . And with Big Jim and Sonny Ruycross staring at him , he goes on to explain : " It happens that I have a bill of sale for the first-place horse , Black Duke . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Page 50 ) 50 ( Continued from Page 47 ) the purse . I shall be happy to turn this money over to you in payment fur the cash that I very foolishly gave away. ? Well ? " says Big Jim . but he is too flabbergasted to continue . " In my coat pocket , " Wally goes on , you will find the bills for every transaction . lf you like the merchandise I have bought , you can keep it . if not , you can slop payment on all the elux  --  ks . The only things I gave cash for are the coffin and the horse , and , since the horse has already paid for himself , you have got no kick there . We are square all around . Jim , except for the ninety-seven dollars and fifty isents I still owe you . " THE SATURDAY Well , Big Jim can see the logic in this . He and Sonny Ruyeross are out nothing at all and , in fact , are the owners of a race horse which can very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pats Wally on the head . You are a good kid , " he says , but a fool . Maybe this will teach you not to give money to strangers . " " I am sorry , " says Wally . " She had a very sweet face . " laughs Big Jim , " if you ever meet this sweet . face again , you eau keep the change . " And , still laughing , lie departs with Sonny Ruycross . In the silence that follows , I am really feeling very sorry for Wally Jones , because I have no doubt that. , EVENING POST at heart , he is , as Big Jim says , a good kid and kind to his mother . In fact , I am about to offer some condolences on the way things turn out , when a white figure deposits a large envelope in Wally 's hand . The white figure is a doctor and he says like this : " I did not want to interrupt you before , Mr. Jones , but a young lady gave me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over to you . " Wally is in a very dazed condition as he tears open the flap and lifts out a pile of greenbacks . There is a note accompanying them and , after reading it , lie swallows hard and hands it to me . This is what the note says : Dear Mr. Jones : 1 am truly sorry , but I just could not bring myself to buy a coffin January 20,1935 for you . The whole idea was too gruesome . Tho doctors tell me that you are not badly hurt , except for that gash in your head , and that you will recover rapidly . I hope you will not be angry with me for not buying the coffin , but you must understand my feelings . i will pay you a visit at the hospital tomorrow and , in the meantime , please , please get some rest . DOROTHY SIMMERS . When I finish reading the note , I look over at Wally . His eyes are closed and there is a contented expression on his face . Naturally , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in his mind , but I have got a hunch that it is a faraway picture of marriage and little children and twenty-five grand to keep the wolf away .
