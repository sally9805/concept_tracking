txt Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt was hailed as the prospective Democratic nominee for President in 1932 by Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana , in a speech at the annual Jefferson Day dinner of the National Democratic Club at the Hotel Commodore last night . Senator Wheeler declared that the " overshadowing issue " before the American people was control of electric power and public utilities . The Democrats of the nation , he said , must follow the policies of the Democrats of New York , as led by former Governor Alfred E. Smith and Governor Roosevelt and preserve control for the people . The Democratic party , he added , also must follow the principles of Thomas Jefferson and continue to oppose a tariff for the benefit of a privileged class and put forward a candidate of a militant , progressive party . " As I look about for a general to lead the Democratic party on these two issues , the tariff and control of power and public utilities , I ask to whom can we go , " Senator Wheeler said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-elect Franklin Roosevelt Governor , the West will demand his nomination for President and the whole country will elect him . " Governor Roosevelt , who was one of the speakers of the dinner , was not present when Senator Wheeler placed him in nomination for the Presidency amid cheers . The Governor , who said he had signed or vetoed 750 bills in the last week and had worked until 3 o'clock nearly every morning , pleaded fatigue and asked to be excused . Roosevelt Warns Nation . Before leaving he had referred to the principles of Jefferson , who , he said , would have viewed with concern the concentration of wealth and capital and the control of public utili ? ties by half a dozen groups through-. out the country . Governor Roosevelt said that a prominent New York banker , a Republican , had informed him that fifty or sixty large corporations , each controlled by two , three or four men . did about 80 per cent of the industrial business of the country . Hundreds of thousands of business men do the remaining 20 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capital , he added , through the merging of banks . " If Thomas Jefferson were alive . he would be the first to question this concentration of economic power , " Governor Roosevelt continued . " On our shoulders rests the responsibility . Our party must apply the principles of Jefferson to determine whether these developments are to the best interests of the nation . " The dinner was in commemoration of the birth of Jefferson 187 years ago and about 2,000 attended . Governor Roosevelt was cheered enthusiastically . The impression among those present was that Senator Wheeler had launched a Presidential boom for the Governor . The speeches were broadcast from stations WOR , WGBS and WJZ and the blue network of the National Broadcasting Company , which covers virtually all the United States except the Pacific Coast . Supreme Court Justice John L. Walsh was toastmaster in place of Mayor Walker , whose presence was prevented by illness . Justice Walsh . was introduced by Thomas J. , president of the club . Mrs. Nellie Tayloe Ross , former Governor of NWoming , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sne contrasted with those of Alexander Hamilton . She declared that the entire history of Republican rule reflected the Hamilton philosophy of fostering the powerful moneyed interests and pointed to Republican support of the pending tariff bill as an illustration . Wheeler Stresses Power Issn.s . " Whoever controls the electric power of the nation in the future will control the economic life of the nation , " Mr. Wheeler said . " On the one side of this issue will be found the gigantic corporations whose tentacles spread throughout the length and breadth of the nation ; reach into the factory and into the home , bring to you your light and your heat , your news and your song , and which corporations if we are not extremely careful , will be able to control and mold public opinion upon every public question whether it be moral , political or economic , either for good or bad . " On the other side is a small group of outstanding men like Norris of Nebraska  --  that man who above all others in the Senate of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who had the courage to desert the party of special privilege and support another man who has fought in the interests of the common man ? your ex-Governor Alfred E. Smith . And in this group , Mr. President , we should not and must not overlook your present Governor , Franklin D. Roosevelt . " Smith and Roosevelt have led the fight in New York . Norris has led the fight in Congress . The Democratic party of the nation must follow the Democratic party of New York upon the issue of power ; it must stand for the liberal principles for which the progressives in Congress have been fighting ; it must not compromise with selfish interests seeking special tariff laws . " Power is the one issue upon which the Republicans dare not compromise . It is their one love from which they dare not desert , and as 1 look over the field for a General to lead the people to victory under the banner of a reunited , militant progressive party , I can not help but fasten my attention upon your Governor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with him I feel sure we can win . " Old-Line Republicans Attacked . Senator Wheeler attacked the oldline Republicans in Congress and the administration of President Hoover for failure to relieve unemployment and for trying to pass a tariff bill in the interest of the manufacturers alone . He criticized the establishment of a commission to alter tariff rates fixed by Congress and said that a coalition of Democrats and progressive Republicans in Congress was trying to reclaim this power for the legislative branch of the government . " With the advent of Grundy to the Senate and his assumption of tariff leadership , there is small chance of the ultimate success of the effort , " he continued . " As usual , the tariff is being written by the tariff profiteers through the customary medium of shameless trades and cynical logrolling . " Of course , the cry of the interests In this tariff business is that it is all in the interest of prosperity . We heard from the Republican Presidential candidate in 1928 and from all the lesser evangels of that day that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hoover 's election . " In the thirteenth month of this administration there are more unemployed than at any other time in the nation 's history . Where is the prosperity that was to be so great that poverty would be abolished and that the poorhouse would become but a relic of the past ? The sixty days are rapidly passing at the end of which we were assured prosperity would be here in full bloom . " Where is it ? No public works have been started and the only thing to correct unemployment has been the ballyhooing by the Departments of Labor and Commerce . Wagner 's Bills Are Praised . " The only constructive bills introduced were those Ity the distinguished Senator from New York , ** Wagner . No word of commenC.ation has been given these bills by the administration , and those of us who are on the ground know they will not be permitted to pass by a r .. publican Congress . " Mr. Wheeler declared that Presi. dent Hoover before election promised farm relief , and after his election called Congress into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that relieved the farmers of their surplus cash , increased their mortgages and caused them to hold and sell wheat for $1 a busoel , for which they could have obtained $1.55 last Fall . The present tariff bill , he added . would force the farmer to pay $5 more on what he buys for every dollar of protection he receives on what he sells . Mr. Wheeler denied also that labor had benefited by the tariff . " Let me call your attention , " he said . " to the fact that the industries of - the nation receiving the highest tariff , the greatest amount of special privilege , are the ones paying the lowest wages , such as rayon , woolen , cotton and other textiles . Yet the increase is asked for in the name of labor . Different Views on Hoover 's Plan . " In the West friends of the administration are saying Mr. Hoover is not for the higher rates placed in the bill . In the East his friends are saying he is . But we all know that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will sign it , and the alibi presented by his press agents is that he will rectify any mistakes which his Congress has made through his bureaucratic tariff commission . " There have been something like 800 increases in the present tariff bill . It has taken the tariff commission on the average about eight months to investigate and recommend changes in one item ; at that rate it would take him about 600 years to rectify through the medium of ' his commission the iniquities of the tariff bill as it will pass Congress .
