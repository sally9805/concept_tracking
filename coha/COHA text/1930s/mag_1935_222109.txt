Lacy McNair , the bridge tender , was the only one who saw it happen , and there was nothing he could do . To let a tug through one morning last week he had just opened the drawbridge over the muddy Appomattox River a mile from Hopewell , Va . when he heard a tearing crash . Twisting , he saw a big Greyhound bus southbound from Richmond skid through the safety gate , plunge with its screaming passengers off the open bridge . Nothing came up from the 24-foot depth but some oil , bubbling and streaking the surface of the yellow river . <P> During the day the gashed body of a river captain floated up , and a diver brought up the corpse of a woman . Other dead , found when the bus had been raised by cranes that night : two men , ten women .
