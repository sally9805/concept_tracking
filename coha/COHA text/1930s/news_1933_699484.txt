txt Mr. ROOSEVELT has remarkable gifts of persuasion . They must be almost supernormal if the persistent rumors are correct that he has " tentatively selected " four Senators as members of his Cabinet and that three , Mr. GLASS , Mr WALSH of Montana and Mr. HULL . have consented . Mr. CUTTING , a Progressive recruit , is said to be doubtful . One would suppose that with one accord would all say , No . The dignity , influence and power of a Senator fit to be in the Cabinet would be rather diminished than enhanced by entering it . The most coveted posts , such as that of Secretary of State and of the Treasury , might tempt a veteran Senator as a means of rounding out his career . But , in favorable political circumstances in his State , the Senator is permanent while the Secretary is transient ; and if the Secretary of State proposes , the majority of the Foreign Affairs Committee disposes . Mr. BORAH knows which is the major and which the minor place , the chairmanship of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From what motives other than tho=e of the sternest self-sacrifice could Senator GLASS be induced to go again to the Treasury ? He has had the honor and the labor . Would not his long-proved competence , his strength of intellect and character be much more effectually exerted for the benefit of his party and the country in the Settate ? The next Senate will be full of new and untried men . There are wild men of inflation in the Chamber now . As Secretary Mr. GLASS can express his opinions in reports and interviews . He can go before committees . He can not fight in the Treasury as he can on the Senate floor , day by day , fantastic economic and financial policies that are inevitably put forth in such times as these . What attraction can the Department of Justice have for Senator WALSH ? The Attorney General is substantially a law clerk who " - finds the law the President wants . " Even the glory of appearing before the Supreme Court usually goes to the Solicitor General . In twenty years Mr. WALsti has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would adorn any office he takes ; but as Attorney General could he do a tithe as much service to the Administration as in the Senate ? And it is uncertain that he could be succeeded in Montana by a Democrat . He has in his own State a popularity hardly to be transferred . Mr. HULL , who served twentytwo years in the House , has not yet finished his second year in the Senate . On the tariff , taxation and allied matters he is an expert . Why should he leave the Senate for the laborious administrative duties of Secretary of Commerce  --  for it seems hardly likely that Mr. ROOSEVELT can have thought of him even " tentatively " as Secretary of State . His committees are Banking and Currency , Finance and Pensions And might he not be followed by another ? Mr. CUTTING , a Progressive Republican out of favor with the machine , may have less to lose by going into the Cabinet ; but he is a highly independent citizen . If the Progressives are to be " rewarded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to accept as Mr. CUTTING may be to refuse . At any rate , the Cabinet should not be ' strengthened b3 weakening the Democratic force : in the Senate . Democratic dissat isfaction now making itself hear ( over the " tentative " choices may pull down some of these tria. balloons .
