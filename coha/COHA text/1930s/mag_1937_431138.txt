A BLACK WIDOW spider lays her eggs , inclosing them in a tight bag of paperlike silk . Weeks later , a tiny hole appears and hundreds of almost microscopic spiderlings come popping out , spinning their miniature webs , just like mother used to make . Sometimes , the egg sac unexpectedly " hatches out " a flock of peppy little parasite flies . What has happened in the secret chamber of that egg sac ? Again , a fat , shapeless maggot stops eating a half-devoured trapdoor spider , and proceeds to spin a marvelous cocoon . Months later , a circular lid is cut open from within , and out comes a beautiful blue-black wasp ! All this is plain to be seen , but what happened inside to change a skinful of spider meat into a delicate , highly organized , winged wasp ? Such questions always fascinated me . Now , after years of experimenting , I am photographing just such secrets of life , by putting glass windows in the walls of egg sacs , cocoons , and the sealed nests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fascinating new world to explore , with a simple homemade outfit . If you have an enlarger and a fairly good small camera to start with , you probably can pick up an old view-camera frame for five or ten dollars ? and that is all you need , except what you can make for yourself at home . Of course , fine equipment is a great advantage . When my own ship comes in , I expect to have the best that money can buy . But expensive equipment is not essential . The Black Widow in photographs published recently ( P.S.M. , Aug. ' 36 , p. 26 ) , and those accompanying this article , were all made with the simple apparatus described here . As shown in the illustrations , a photographing cage is ' simply a pair of glass plates sandwiched on a piece of wood or built-up cardboard in which an opening has been cut to receive the insects , egg sac , or cocoon to be studied . A sliding piece closes the opening at the top . To put an observation window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of its side and it is placed in a cage , with the opening against one of the glass walls . Then , with the cage set upright in its slotted wooden base , the photographer can watch for the mysterious life processes that he wishes to record . Now as to my photographic equipment and some of the tricks I have learned by the trial-and-error method : My laboratory is the bathroom and the kitchen sink , all the developing being done at night with a blanket hung over the bathroom window . I use supersensitive panchromatic film ( with- out a filter ) , and develop in absolute darkness by the time-and-temperature method , in trays set on a wide board laid the long way of the bathtub . As I develop often , and usually only a few films at a time , I take the easiest way and use " M-Q " tubes , sixteen ounces of water to the tube , developing from six to ten minutes at sixty-five degrees according to the degree of contrast desired . My shooting outfit consists of an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap lens , ( F/6.3 ) from an old post-card-size camera , set in a homemade lens board . This lens has a 612-inch focus and , with the twenty-eight-inch bellows extension , gives me a four-times magnification on the negative . With an auxiliary copying lens I can get about a seven-times direct magnification , but this allows such a shallow depth of sharp focus that it can be used only with the smallest insects . For most of my work , I use two and four-times magnification , and have made a " reducer " out of an old eight-by-ten film holder , ( to take five-by-seven film on one side and 3 ? - by- 5 on the other ) , making the slots by gluing on strips cut from the slide of another old film holder . All of my finished prints are five-by-seven , usually enlarged from the 3 ? - by- 5 size . In this work , the eight-by-ten bellows is better than a five-by-seven , even when used with five-by-seven film , as the roomy bellows reduces the inside reflection explained later . This camera , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as shown , on an eight-foot bench built like a rough carpenter 's bench but well braced to prevent vibration . Both the top and the edge of the board used for a runway for the camera should be true and straight . A guide block is clamped to the camera track and , when the desired focus is obtained , the camera is clamped tight to the bench with a simi- lar clamp as shown in the photographs . Of course , the main problem ( especially in photographing dead-black subjects like the Black Widow spider ) is to light the subject as strongly as possible so as to cut the necessary exposure to a minimum . The greater the magnification , the longer the exposure required . When the short-focus lens is stopped down to its F/32 mark , for instance , and you are using a twentyeight-inch bellows extension , you are actually doing what amounts to " pinhole photography . " And yet , in working with large focus . So close-up , intense lighting is required , but it must be used carefully and sparingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , can easily kill some rare specimen , even when protected by a thickness of glass . So keep the lights well back when focusing and set them up close to the photographing cage only while making the exposure . For subjects that will remain still , the No. 1 photoflood light is very good , for it can be studied and controlled . But for active insects , a No. 20 photoflash is almost a necessity . Your shutter need not be synchronized with the flash . In fact , you will need all the light of the full flash in most cases . Place your flash switch on a solid block that can be moved up close to the front of the camera . Use one hand for the shutter bulb and one for the switch . Then watch patiently until the insects take the pose you want ? even if it is an hour or two ! Then ? open shutter ? flash ? close shutter . For most subjects , it is advisable to set a light cardboard reflector at the other side of the cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cage and lighten the shadows , for the photoflash lighting is harsh at best . For medium or dark subjects , shooting with the diaphragm set at the F/16 mark , for a four-times magnification at full bellows extension , I often set the flash within five or six inches of the cage , but you can settle these details for your own work by test and experiment . A helpful cold-weather trick in working with constantly active insects , ( like the Gaurax araneae parasites that go after the Black Widow 's eggs ) , is to work in a cold room and chill some of the ambition out of them , then shoot them while they are still cold . Even the photoflash is not fast enough to get a rapidly moving insect . Remember that with a four-times magnification , an insect is traveling across the negative just four times as fast as he actually is moving in the cage . The only sure way is to wait patiently until it slows down momentarily , and then shoot it " on the wing " as in duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of photography is to keep every ray of outside light away from the lens and the front of the camera . Perhaps you have read " instructions " to the effect that lights or light surfaces in front of the camera and " outside of the picture " are harmless and need not be considered . But that is the bunk except for amateurish snapshots ! The  | actual truth is that every ray of light that strikes the lens outside of the picture finds its way to the negative and causes a definite amount of fog ! For instance , suppose you are using a white background as you shoot through the cage , and that , on the easel , this background will cover a space of five by seven inches or less . And suppose , for the sake of convenience , that you pin up a white card eleven by fourteen inches or more , as I used to do . Then every square inch of that superfluous , glaring white border , outside of the required five by seven inches , will cast its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays from this white surface will strike the outer areas of your lens and be refracted to the inner surfaces of your bellows ; some of them will be reflected onto your negative . There are many other possible sources of flattening fog . Glossy , light-colored walls and ceilings are bad foggers . The light from the wall in front of your camera also enters the outer areas of your lens and adds its quota of fog as just explained . A little , even , of the light from the wall back of your camera hits the front of the insect cage and is reflected directly or indirectly onto your negative . And , of course , the photographing light must be kept far enough to the side so that no part of the reflector or the light can be reflected back into the lens . BUT all this possible fog can be eliminated or reduced to a negligible minimum . The background easel can be covered with black cloth and the white background , when required , can be kept down to the smallest card that will cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera also should be masked with a piece of black cloth with a hole cut in the middle for the lens and shutter . Black outing flannel is cheap and serves as well as black velvet . A lens hood made of black paper , fitting snugly over the lens , is helpful in shutting out unwanted light rays , but it often is necessary to place a shield between the lights and the lens , as well . As for the walls ? the ideal studio for this kind of work would be a darkroom , painted and calcimined in flat black . If circumstances forbid such treatment of the room , a smaller , inner room can be constructed by hanging black cloth curtains around the work bench . I realize that many workers will scoff at some of these as unnecessary precautions ; nevertheless each one of them does its bit towards the elimination of fog , and the producing of brilliant negatives ? and so is well worth the trouble involved . Quite recently I had my own storeroom calcimined in dark brown , and it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I had to reduce my time of development .. Obviously , this was because over-development was no longer necessary in order to kill the flattening effect of the fog I was getting from white walls . BUT to go back for a moment to the photographing cages . It is quite true that glass cages increase reflection danger , especially when you are using dark backgrounds , but their advantages more than compensate for this . By shooting through these cages , all distracting background shadows are avoided . And by having a selection of cages of various depths for insects of different sizes , everything within the cages is always in focus . Whether you are working with open cages or " glass-windowed cocoons , " each specimen feels at home and can be set up and shot at a moment 's notice when anything interesting is about to happen . You are photographing real , natural life , with a " candid camera . " And , when important developments are expected in some such secret chamber , the cage can even be left on the stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . Patience and persistence also are important units of equipment . Sometimes you will have to wait for hours to get the shots that you want ? and then , perhaps , do it over and over again until it is right . In some cases , you will have to wait weeks , or months , or even a year , for the right season , to get a single shot to complete the life history of a certain species . An exceptional case is that of my Black Widow series , which was three years in the making .. So it is a good idea to work with several species at the same time . Then you can avoid the long waits and there will nearly always be developments to keep you busy .  |
