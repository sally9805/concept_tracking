txt Purchasers of intoxicating liquor are not guilty of violating the prohibition law , the Supreme Court unanimously decided today , in an opinion handed down by Justice Sutherland . The opinion , rendered in the case of the government against James E. Farrar of Massachusetts , was regarded of extreme importance , in view of the many attempts now being made to find the buyer equally guilty with the seller . Taking the ground that Congress had deliberately and designedly omitted to impose any criminal liability upon the purchaser , and that during all the ten years ' life of national prohibition the government had never tried to punish the purchaser until now , the Supreme Court upheld the District Court of Massachusetts , which had quashed an indictment against Farrar . Norris Issue Sidestepped . In another celebrated case involving the punishment of a purchaser the court , in another unanimous opinion handed down by Mr. Sutherland , declined to rule qn the main issue and merely decided that Alfred E.

Kerner of Philadelphia , since convicted as a bootlegger , whereupon the government sought to establish a conspiracy case because the transaction occurred across State borders . The Supreme Court , however , refused to express itself on the conspiracy issue and sustained the fine on . the ground that the plea of nolo contendere was equal to a confession of guilt . The charge against Farrar was that on Sept. 28 , 1929 , he " unlawfully and knowingly " purchased liquor from Frank Rotondo in Cambridge . The indictment was quashed by a Federal district court in Massachusetts on the ground that " the ordinary purchaser of intoxicating liquor does not come within the purview of the act . " Opinion in the Farrar Case . In his opinion in the Farrar case , Justice Sutherland said : " By indictment returned in the Federal district court of Massachusetts the defendant ( appellee ) was charged with unlawfully and knowingly having purchased intoxicating liquor fit for use for beverage purpose in violation of the national prohibition act .

" Section 3 of the prohibition act ( C8541 , Stat. 305 , 308 ) makes it unlawful for any person to ' manufacture , sell , barter , transport , import , export , deliver , furnish or possess any intoxicating liquor except as authorized in this act * * * ' ; but provides that ' liquor for non-beverage purposes and wine for sacramental purposes may be manufactured , purchased , sold * " but only as herein provided , and the commissioner may , upon application , issue permits therefor * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act ( Stat. 310 ) provides : ' No one manufacture , sell , purchase , transport , or prescribe any liquor without first obtaining a , permit from the commissioner ' so to do , except that a person may , without a permit , purchase and use liquor . for medicinal purposes when pre , .

" The motion was denied and judg meat rendered against Norris , who was thereupon sentenced to pay a fine of $200 . The District Court treated the stipulation as ' evidence ? for the information of the court in determining what sentence , if any , ought to be imposed upon the defendant Norris , ' which it ' received and made part of the record for the limited purpose above stated . ' ? Verdict Reversed on Appeal . " The bourt of Appeals sustained the sufficiency of the indictment , but , considering the case upon the stipulation of facts , reached the conclusion that the transactions therein disclosed did not subject the purchaser and seller of intoxicating liquor to an indictment for conspiracy to transport , and reversed the judgment of the trial court .

" If the stipulation be regarded as adding particulars to the indictment , it must fall before the rule that nothing can be added to an indictment without the concurrence of the grand jury by which the bill was found . " If filed before plea and given effect , such a stipulation would oust the jurisdiction of the court . " The court cited several of its decisions holding that the defendant 's consent does not affect the rule . " No Issue of Fact Exists . " " After the plea , " Justice ? utherland continued , " nothing is left but to render judgment , for the obvious reason that in the face of the plea no issue of fact exists , and none can d plied to minor violations , leaving to_the Federal authorities free to concei trate against smugglers , conspirator and other large-scale operators . nFacilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows , with a force ' of about 2,000 men , th d Prohibition Bureau has filled " th penitentiaries and clogged the Fei e eral courts ..

" However that may be , it is fair to assume that Congress , when it came to pass the prohibition act , knew this history and , acting in the light of it , deliberately and designedly omitted to impose upon the purchaser of liquor for beverage purposes any criminal liability . " If aid were needed to support this view of the matter , it would be found in the fact , conceded by the government 's brief , that during the entire life of the national prohibition act , a period of ten years , the executive departments charged with the administration and enforcement of the act have uniformly construed it as not including the purchaser in a case like the present ; no prosecution until the present one has ever been undertaken upon a different theory ; and Congress , of course , well aware of this construction and practice , has significantly left the law in its original form .

" Regarded as evidence on the question of guilt or innocence , the stipulation came too late , for the plea of nolo contendere upon that question and for that case - was as conclusive as a plea of guilty would have been .

The government was defeated " when the court declined to heed its appeal from the quashing of the Farrar indictment . It won a technical victory when the court sustained the $200 Norris fine imposed by a lower court , which had been reversed by the Court of Appeals . It failed , however , to establish the conspiracy between Norris and Kerper , because the Supreme Court did not rule upon this question . Reaction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury Lowman at once declared that law enforcement would not be slowed up . " It always had meen the policy of the Prohibition Bureau not to prosecute purchasers of liquor except where it was shown that they were guilty of conspiracy to violate the law by arranging for the delivery of the liquor or in some other such fashion , " Mr. Lowman said . " Thus the Supreme Court decision will not result in any change of policy . It does clear up a doubtful point , however , as there were some authorities who contended the purchaser was equally guilty with the seller . Prosecuting officers brought the case against the purchaser to bring about a precedent-setting decision . The Treasury is pleased that such a decision has been obtained . " Possession Sometimes Charged . It was pointed out that in extreme cases , where it was desirable to prosecute , a purchaser might be charged with possession of liquor , which is a violation of the Volstead act . The decision , however , would eliminate the prosecution of a purchaser who consumed the liquor immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it in his possession . Privately , it was ' understood . that both Mr. Lowman and Prohibition Commissioner Doran considered that prosecution of purchasers would henceforth be extremely impractical . Senator Jones , one of the leading Senate drys , doubted whether , in view of the decision , it would now be wise to push- the Sheppard bill , which contemplates punishing the buyer of liquor . Senator Sheppard would not discuss the opinion , but announced that he would press for action on his bill . The Supreme Court also ruled against the government in the cases of the Swanson Chemical Corporation , Martin H. Cooper , the Galeno Chemical Company , D. P. Paul &; Co. , Inc. , and W. H. Long , Inc . In these cases the court held that liquor permits outstanding Oct. 7 , 1927 , when a new regulation was issued , should run indefinitely unless terminated for cause such as violation of the law , and that permits issued after that date should run on an annual basis or for whatever term they were issued . Violation Must Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n order to terminate permits , must show a law violation . Under the treasury regulations , which were held illegal , the government could refuse to reissue a permit on its periodical termination , and it would be necessary for the prospective permittee to establish in the Federal courts his right to the permit . Some treasury experts thought that the decision might possibly make more difficult the prevention of diversion of industrial alcohol to booteg channels . The objection of the Treasury Department to the prosecution of a urchaser has been based on the eneral policy , adopted some ? years go , that the States and municipaliies should enforce the law as opOpinion in Previous Case . " This court , in affirming the judgment , said ( pp. 361-362 ) : " ' Of the thirty-nine sections ? In Title II of the act , which deals with national prohibition , more than half , including the seven sections which precede Section 10 , contain provisions authorizing or regulating the manufacture , sale , transportation or use of intoxicating liquor for non-beverage , purposes . ' These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or scheme to regulate the disposition of alcoholic liquor not prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment in such manner as to minimize the danger of its diversion from authorized or permitted uses to beverage purposes . These provisions plainly relate to those persons who are authorized to sell , transport , use or possess intoxicating liquors under the Eighteenth Amendment and the provisions of Section 3 of the act already quoted . ' " And it was held ( p. 363 ) that the words no person ' in Section 10 refer to persons authorized under other provisions of the act to carry on traffic in alcoholic liquors , not to the ordinary violator of a provision prohibiting transactions in respect of liquors for beverage purposes . Act Deals With Two Phases . " It Is not necessary to repeat the citation of authorities or the pertinent canons of statutory construction set forth in the opinion to support this conclusion . We are unable to find any logical ground for holding that the wards no person ' in Section 10 are used in the restricted sense thus stated , but that identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same general plan for controlling the authorized traffic in intoxicating liquors , may be given an unlimited application . " Obviously , the national prohibition act deals with the liquor traffic from two different points of view . In the case of beverage liquors , except fa sacramental and medicinal purposes , the traffic is prohibited absolutely and unconditionally ; in the case of non-beverage liquors it is permitted but carefully regulated . " The prohibitions in Section 3 are with respect to the former , while those in Section 6 are with respect to tie latter . In the former the sale but not the purchase is prohibited ; in the latter both are prohibited . " Since long before the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment it has been held with , practical unanimity that , in the absence of an express statutory provision to the contrary , the purchaser of intoxicating liquor , the sale of which was prohibited , was guilty of no offense . Exceptions Rare . " And statutes to the contrary have been the rare exception . Probably it was thought more important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Following this language , the section regulates with much detail the issue , character and duration of the permit , and the application therefor , which application , among other things , must set forth ' the , qualification of the applicant and the purpose for which the liquor is to be used . ' " The form of the permit and application and the facts to be set forth therein are to be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue who is to require a bond in such form and amount as he may prescribe to insure compliance with the terms of the permit and provisions of the act . " A large part of the act , including Section 6 , is devoted to the subject of the authorized manufacture , sale , transportation , and use of intoxicating liquor for non-beverage purposes ; while Section 3 plainly deals with the prohibited traffic in such liquors for beverage purposes . Defendant Not in Business . " The government relies upon the literal terms of Section 6 , that ' no one shall ? ? ? purchase ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioner so to do ? ? ? ' ; but at the same time frankly concedes that the application of this language to the present case is not free from doubt . " The contrary view is that these words , considered in connection with the other provisions of Section 6 and correlated sections , relate only to that class of persons who are authorized to sell , purchase or otherwise deal with intoxicating liquors for nonbeverage purposes , and who proceed to do so without a permit . That this defendant does not belong to that class , and could not , under any circumstances , have obtained a permit to make a purchase of the character here made , is not in dispute . The question thus presented is very nearly the same as that decided in United States v. Katz , 271 U. S. 354 ; and in principle is concluded by that case . " There the defendants were charged with conspiracy to sell intoxicating liquors without making a permanent record of the sale , in violation of Section 10 of the act . " The indictments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 10 , which required a permanent record to be made of sales , applied only to persons authorized to sell alcoholic liquor , and that the indictment failed to allege that either of the defendants held a permit or was otherwise authorized to sell . In his opinion in the Norris case Justice Sutherland stated :
