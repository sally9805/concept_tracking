The Congregational &; Christian Church is a three-year-old merger of a stout body which stems from the Pilgrim Fathers of 1620 , and a small left-wing Methodist sect formed in 1792 . With a million-odd members in 6,000 churches , the C. &; C. Church has a moderator but no ponderous machinery to run things from the top . With New England firmness the individual churches do their own thinking and talking . This church last week was the first to come out against the scheme of Chicago 's Adolph Oettinger Goodwin to gear piety with business in such a way that church folk would get rebates for buying selected merchandise ( TIME , Dec. 4 ) . <P> In Evanston , Ill. met 250 C. &; C. secretaries , State superintendents , mission board members , committee men and women . Dr. Charles Emerson Burton , general secretary , told them how income had gone down , how all the churches seemed prostrate with a " spirit of defeatism . " The delegates voted to start a coin-box campaign for " a **25;11359;TOOLONG . " But raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessmen sell their products , they could not go . The C. &; C. church club women voted their protest against " exploitation of the women of the churches " by the Goodwin Plan or any other . <P> Most of the secular Press has ignored the Goodwin Plan . But the church Press has been explanatory and denunciatory , with the liberal Christian Century the most vigilant . Seizing upon the list of churchmen who endorsed the Goodwin Plan , the Christian Century got Dr. Ernest Fremont Tittle of Evanston and Dr. Ralph Washington Sockman of Manhattan , both famed Methodists , to recant . Not to be shamed out of their support for this temple &; trade hookup , however , were Episcopal Bishops George Craig Stewart ( Chicago ) and James Matthew Maxon ( Tennessee ) ; Methodist Bishops Francis John McConnell ( New York ) and Ernest Lynn Waldorf ( Chicago ) .
