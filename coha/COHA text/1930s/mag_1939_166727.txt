S. on its ear . That was in the fall of 1915 when as Edith Boiling Galt , handsome , middle-aged widow of a Washington jeweler , she consented to marry 58-year-old Thomas Woodrow Wilson , 28th President of the U. S. This week Mrs. Edith Boiling galt Wilson once more made news when she published a big , chatty , contentious 360-page autobiography , My Memoir. * <P> For contention , which started when Satevepost recently serialized excerpts from her story , Widow Wilson furnished plenty of material . Friends of Woodrow Wilson 's faithful Irish Secretary Joseph Patrick Tumulty , now a high-powered Washington lobbyist , hotly dispute Mrs. Wilson 's accounts that he 1 ) tried to get Wilson interested in the since exploded story that Warren Gamaliel Harding had Negro blood ; 2 ) faked a Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1924 .

" <P> &gt;Sober Woodrow Wilson liked to put on a record in the Oval Room after dinner and practice a jig step , envied minstrel dancers because they " took on no more at their hearts than they could kick off at their heels . " Another diversion of the 28th President of the U. S. : after long White House receptions he " loved to get upstairs and twist his face about . . . . He could make his ears move and elongate his face or broaden it in a perfectly ludicrous way .
