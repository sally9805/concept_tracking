THE RIPENING - Colette - Farrar &; Rinehart . What Elinor Glyn used to be to thousands , Colette has increasingly become : purveyor to those who like mild aphrodisiacs in print. * But Colette , far above Authoress Glyn 's tabloid class , wraps her erotic tablets in bathos-proof cellophane . Her uncanny feminine understanding , hearty physical sympathy for the internal workings of human nerves and glands , make her a writer who can not avoid being labeled passionate but who never runs any danger of being cheap . Of the many Colette translations that have appeared in the U. S. in the last few years , The Ripening is one of the neatest and best . Philippe and Vinca have spent many a comradely summer in the seaside cottage rented jointly by their families . But this year adolescence has made their old comradeship a little tense . Very fond of each other , they are ashamed of the word " love , " take it mutually for granted that some day . . . . But the future gets a forced growth when Philippe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She casts a greedily speculative eye on Philippe 's 16-year-old bronzed body . When he brings her flowers , she does the rest . He is horrified , fascinated , sneaks back to her at night , again &; again , again . Vinca guesses his secret , confronts him with it . Terribly sorry but terribly proud too , Philippe confesses , hopes Vinca will not want to kill herself . Much to his surprise , she does just the opposite ; to his bewildered chagrin , takes it in her uncanny feminine stride , teaches him a lesson about women that he will never forget , never understand . <P> *Euphemism for 99.44% of all readers .
