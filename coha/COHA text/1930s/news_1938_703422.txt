txt The city council 's local transportation committee yesterday instructed the corporation counsel to prepare a temporary ninety clay franchise or dinance under which the Chicago Surface Lines would pay the city 3 per cent of their gross receipts for use of the city streets . This would amount to nearly ; $1,500,000 yearly , based on gross earnings of approximately 50 million dollars in 1937 and in 1936 . William 11 . Sexton , counsel for the committee , was also instructed to inform Federal Juc'ge James H. Wilkerson of the pending ordinance at a federal court hearing Tuesday . The street car companies are in receivership in the federal courts , and the city . will seek , when the ordinance is passed . to have Judge Wilkerson instruct re ceivers for the companies to operate the lines under the provisions of the franchise . No Collections Since 1931 . If the city wins its point it will collect its first compensation from the surface lines since 1931 . Under the 1907 traction ordinance the lines were required to pa , g , into the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of 5 per cent on the agreed value of the properties . Earnings fell below the 5 per cent figure in 1931 . Since the street car security holders ' rights to the 5 per cent earnings arc cumulative , a deficit of about $11,000,000 has been piled up , which must he paid off from earnings over 5 per cent before the traction fund gets any more money . Passage of the proposed franchise would have the effect , however , of ' wiping out provisions of the 1907 ordinance so far as they applied to compensation , and substituting the fiat 3 per cent oayment .

" The street cars will keep on running . The only difference is that we may get some compensation for the use of our streets . " Your committee and your experts are the only ones who have done anything constructive toward solution of the traction problem . They drew up a plan in January , 1937 . They submitted that plan . The surface lines have refused even to comment on it . Assails Lack of Action . " Up to now certain interests in those companies have done nothing in the belief that they had a perpetual franchise . That may have been true up to the passage of the home rule act . It may have been true up to the development of buses , because the only way the city could get rid of the street car companies was to pay approximately $170,000,000 for their properties . Now , however , we can substitute bus operation if they continue in their refusal to deal .
