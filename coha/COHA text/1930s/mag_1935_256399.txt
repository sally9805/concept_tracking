His family 's failing for falling in love has long been a heartache to toothy old Gustaf V , King of Sweden and of the Goths and Wends . Romance has already induced one of his brothers and two of his grandsons to renounce their royal rights and marry commoners . The women of his family , however , behave better about such things . His niece , the Princess Astrid , is now Queen of the Belgians , and last week his pretty 25-year-old granddaughter , Princess Ingrid , made him feel every inch a King by marrying with much pomp &; ceremony the 6-ft. 5-in. heir to the throne of Denmark , hulking , kindly 36-year-old Crown Prince Frederick . <P> Never had Stockholm seen so much royalty , felt such excitement . By train and boat they kept piling in until there was scarcely a room in the palace or in any hotel to be had . Nearly out of his mind was Stockholm 's chief of police . Law-abiding Swedes are accustomed to see their own royal family shop , go to the theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of police was called upon to produce so many escorts and bodyguards for visiting royalty that he nearly ran out of detectives . <P> Three Kings were there : Oscar Gustaf Adolf of Sweden , Charles Frederick Albert Alexander William Christian of Denmark , and Leopold Philippe Charles Albert Meinrad Hubertus Marie Miguel of the Belgians . For the first time since the heavy-booted German army marched through his father 's capital in 1914 , King Leopold was brought face to face with the onetime Crown Prince of Germany . It was carefully arranged that their suites should be at opposite ends of the Stockholm palace , and court attendants were in a dither with excitement . But when they met in the Town Hall , nothing happened . <P> Notably absent was Christian 's brother , King Haakon of Norway , but he sent his son , Crown Prince Olaf to represent him , and his two toddling granddaughters Princesses Ragnhild , 4 , and Astrid , 3 , were the only bridesmaids . Marie of Rumania , to everyone 's relief , did not come . <P> Wedding presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by the father of Frederick the Great , from King Gustaf ; a modern diamond brooch from Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf , father of the bride ; a sapphire pendant from George V ; and five kroner in cash ( $1.25 ) from an unknown Swedish girl . Because blue is Sweden 's royal color and Princess Ingrid is passionately addicted to larkspur , a plane piled high with larkspur flew over from London to decorate the wedding church , Stockholm 's 13th Century Storkyrka . Leading a concert of Danish and Swedish songs before all the wedding guests , Conductor Sven Lizell of the Stockholm Choral Society dropped dead of heart failure . <P> The wedding day was warm and clear . Before the Storkyrka , where all the Kings descending from Napoleon 's Marshal Bernadotte have been crowned , stood Sweden 's famed Grenadiers of the Guard in the original deerskin uniforms , jack boots , silver breastplates and cocked hats first presented by Russia 's Catherine the Great .                   @ @
