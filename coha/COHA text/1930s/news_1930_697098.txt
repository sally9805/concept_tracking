txt President Hoover turned tonight from the immediate problems of the government , and at a dinner of the Boy Scouts of America in the Willard Hotel paid tribute to the high purposes of the Boy Scout movement and emphasized the service the organization performs by inculcating in the boys of the country a sense of " responsibility to the community . ' This instruction , he said , gives " the conviction that every person in the Republic owes a service to the Republic , " and " that the Republic rests solely upon the willingness of every one born in it to bear his part of the duties and obligations of citizenship . " This he termed " the only patriotism of peace . " The dinner was attended by over 400 business and professional men from all sections of the country to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America and to launch the five-year expansion program of the organization . President Hoover , who has canceled many engagements on account of the death of William Howard Taft , attended in the conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in the Boy Scout movement , would have desired him to lend his presence and voice to the meeting . Head Says Scouts Aid Hoover . Walter W. Head of Chicago , president of the Boy Scouts of America , declared that " no man present tonight realizes the necessity for leadership of youth by such an organization " more than President Hoover . " To him , " he added , " more than to any other man , is given the opportunity to know our country . I know that his task has been made easier because of the 4,000,000 boys who have received , through the Scout organization , a training for manhood . " There is a need for a citizenship which does not follow blindly , but which sees clearly and thinks soundly , a citizenship which understands the functions of government and which supports a government which fulfills those functions , a citizenship which is intelligent , just and tolerant . There are 15,000,000 boys of 9 years and over outside our ranks . Those 15,000,000 boys constitute the challenge that is before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Vice President Curtis and including Speaker Longworth , members of the Cabinet , Judge John Barton Payne , president of the American Red Cross ; William Green , . president of the American Federation of Labor , and William Butterworth , president of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States . Text of President 's Speech . President Hoover spoke as follows : " Mr. Chairman , officers of the Boy Scouts and your guests : We meet this evening under the cloud of deep sadness . Since many of you started your journey to Washington the most beloved of Americans has passed into the Great Beyond , and in determining not to cancel this occasion , your committee has acted in the spirit of William Howard Taft . " With a life-long , open-hearted devotion to boys , the first honorary president of the Boy Scouts would , had he known of it , insisted that your work should go forward . " This occasion commemorates the twentieth anniversary of the Boy Scouts , and it is indeed in keeping with the true tribute to his great spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met in the special interest of boys . I am a willing ally in that interest . There is no feeling of exclusion of their sisters from our concern , but their similar problems are to be considered elsewhere . " Together with his sister , the boy is the most precious possession of the American home . I sometimes think that one of the sad things of life is that they will grow up . Literatiwe and lore have established our boys in varied relations to life ; as a growing animal of superlative promise , to be fed and watered and kept warm ; as a periodic nuisance ; as a joy forever ; as the incarnation of destruction ; as the father of the man ; as the child of iniquity ; as the problem of our times and the hope of the nation . " In any event , he is a complex of cells teeming with affection , filled with curiosity as to every mortal thing ; radiating sunlight to all the world ; endowed with dynamic energy and the impelling desire to take exercise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , and the wisdom in his upbringing consists more often in the determination of what to do with him next rather than in what he shall do when he goes out into the cold world . Problem One of Direction . " The problem that we are considering here is not primarily a system of health or education or morals . It is what to do with him in his leisure time that will , of course , contribute to his health and his education and his morals , but in the main what will direct his interests to constructive joy instead of destructive glee and will yield him constructive joy for the balance of his life . " The Declaration of Independence calls special attention to him and his sister in the reference to the inalienable right to liberty and pursuit of happiness . At least in the practical workings of the republic we find it easier to realize these rights for boys than we do for the grown-up , taxpaying citizen . " As civilization becomes more complex , and as the number of human beings per acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cities than in the countryside , and as the necessity of submitting to all forms of mechanical device carries us further and further from the simple and more primitive forms of life , we are unconsciously decreasine. liberty for boys and diminishing the opportunities opportunities for pursuit of happiness , because the boy is a primitive animal and takes to primitive life . His true life should be one of discovery , adventure , and great undertakings not to be found in either the squalor of the tenement house or the drawing room of palatial apartments . " Portals of Adventure " Opened . " The Boy Scout movement has opened for him the portals to adventure and constructive joy by reviving the lore of the frontier and the campfire ; by establishing contacts with the birds and sometimes with the bees ; by matching his patience to tha-deliberative character of fish ; by efficient operation of the swimming hole , and by peeps into the thousand mysteries of the streams , the trees and the stars . " And it is more than this . By the promotion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and competition with zeal but without unfair advantage and without bitterness ; restraint that remarks nothing of others which can not be at once forgiven ; willingness to subordinate one 's self into the teamwork for the common aim  --  that is sportsmanship . " There can not be Boy Scouts without organization and leaders . " And by leaders I include particularly those devoted men who as troop leaders become the inspiration and friends of boys , and upon whom rests the responsibility of actually administering constructive joy . " Through its organization our boys learn of discipline , they learn the unity of effort , cooperation and the democracy of play and work , they learn of the duties and satisfactions of service . All of these are the foundations of life , the basis of liberty and happiness , the safeguards against destructive joy in the grownup life hereafter . Enthusiasm " Treasure of Boyhood . " " The priceless treasure of boyhood is his endless enthusiasm , his store of high idealism and his fragrant hopes . His is the plastic period when indelible impressions must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We assure ourselves that the cure of illiteracy and the fundamentals of education are the three R 's  --  reading , ' ritin , ' and ' rithmetic . To this we must add one more R , and that is responsibility ? responsibility to the community  --  if we are not to have illiteracy in government . " The conviction that every person in the Republic owes a service to the Republic , that the Republic rests solely upon the willingness of every one born in it to bear his part of the duties and obligations of citizenship , is as important as the ability to read and write  --  that is the only patriotism of peace . " The idea that the Republic was created for the benefit of the individual is a mockery that must be eradicated at the first dawn of understanding . It is true that many of our schools have recognized this obligation . It is true that our teachers are guiding our children in the first steps of democracy , but I know of no agency that can be more powerful in support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we look over the Republic today we find many failures in citizenship  --  we find many betrayals of those who have been selected to leadership . I can not conceive that these failures would take place if every citizen who went to the polls was a good ' Scout , ' and every official who was elected had ever been a real Boy Scout . " I give you a powerful statistic . There are about one million Boy Scouts in the United States . There is raw material for ten million more . " On motion of Mortimer L. Schiff of New York , vice president of the Boy Scouts of America , endorsement was given to a public appeal for the $10,000,000 fund with which to finance the five-year program , as well ' as to establish a national training centre and a retirement fund for those professionally engaged in the scout movement . Announcement was made that $2,050,000 of this fund had already been received . There have been two gifts of $500,000 each , one of $250,000 and six of $100,000 each .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
