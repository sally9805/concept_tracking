It is clear that King Carol 's dictatorial Government hopes , in this way , to annihilate all of its political opponents . The measures are in line . with increasing restrictions which have been adopted since the plebiscite of Feb. 24 " approved " the new Rumanian constitution , vastly increasing the Sovereign 's powers . Thus , by the new " defense of the State " act , the King will prevent the activities not only of Cornelius Codreanu 's Fascist Iron Guard , but also of Dr. Juliu Maniu 's democratic movement , and all other mass representation of sections of Rumanian public opinion . The new moves have conspired . however , to make the Government far from popular .

Efforts to abolish a popular movement without putting anything in its place have not been very successful in modern Europe .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
