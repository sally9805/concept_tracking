 | Pull Down the Poorhouse Condensed from Collier 's , The National Weekly ( June 28 , ' 30 ) William G. Shepherd WE USED to think of old age pensions as socialism . But now old age pensions are coming on this country , state by state , just about as rapidly as the good roads came after we really got started on them . Who first seized this old age pension plan from the socialists ? It 's a story that people of other countries could n't understand because they do n't do things our way in any other place on the globe . Our land , as we all know , abounds in civic organizations . Most of us belong to something : Rotary , Lions , Kiwanis , ParentTeachers , church clubs , political clubs , community clubs . Plenty of our organizations get well organized and then are forced to look around for something helpful to do . " Service " they call it . Our intelligentsia often laugh at this " service . " But our organizations get things done . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of child welfare . " Down with the orphan asylums ; keep homes together by pensioning widowed mothers " was , in effect , their slogan . The fraternity of Elks took up the welfare of crippled 1 children . And the fraternity known as the Eagles decided to make a fight to establish old age pensions in every state in the Union . And that 's how it comes that 11 pens , with which old age pension laws have been created , now rest in the office of Frank E. Hering , editor of the national journal of the Eagles at South Bend , Indiana . One of these pens was used by the governor of Alaska , where citizens decided that no old-timer , man or woman , who had helped to settle that once-difficult country should , on account of old age , suffer for lack of food , clothing , shelter and reasonable comfort . If you live in Alaska or any one of the following 11 states the chances are you may under certain circumstances receive a pension , if necessary , after reaching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929 ; Colorado , 1927 ; Kentucky , 1926 ; Maryland , 1927 ; Minnesota , 1929 ; Montana , 1923 ; Nevada , 1925 ; New York , 1930 ; Utah , 1929 ; Wisconsin , 1925 ; Wyoming , 1929 . The pension age is 65 years in Nevada , Maryland , Utah and  | Wyoming . In Alaska it is 65 for males and 6o for females . In other states it is 70 . In their fight for old age pensions the Eagles have enlisted the help of other lodges . They have laid special assessments on themselves . They have made speeches in churches and before clubs . ' They made a moving picture entitled Over the Hill to the Poorhouse which was shown in over 12,000 cities and towns . " Why should n't the United States have old age pensions if all these other countries have them ? " they asked . It does seem strange when you read the list : Argentina , Australia , Austria , Belgium , Bulgaria , Canada , Chile , Czechoslovakia , Denmark , Finland , France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Irish Free State , Italy , Jugoslavia , Luxemburg , Netherlands , Newfoundland , New Zealand , Norway , Portugal , Roumania , Spain , Sweden , South Africa and Uruguay . I asked Governor Roosevelt whether there was any great need in the state of New York for the old age pension . " It looks to me , " said the governor , " as if almost every step in our industrial progress makes things harder , financially , for those over 65 or 70 years . " " Why should n't people save for old age ? " " Does n't it occur to you that saving for old age may , many times , look like utter selfishness on the part of parents ? It 's easier to spend it for better health and higher education and other advantages for your children . " " it 's ridiculous not to have old age pensions in the United States , " a fact-equipped Eagle said to me . " Look at Canada . Their report for 1928 showed that 450 people , American born , who moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've found out that there 's an - old Japanese man in British Columbia who gets the pension . We 've traced down three Syrians and one Turk , a couple of Algerians , a Greek , a Chilean , a Latvian , whatever that is , and 285 Russians who are living on the Canadian pension . You know how the Canadians hated the Germans during the war ? Well , there are 173 Germans on Canadian old age pensions today ; and 837 Austrians . Altogether there are about 35,000 old folks on the Canadian old age pension rolls . " They figure in Canada that a fellow who works for 15 or 20 years and becomes a citizen has really helped to build up the country . That goes for women , too . It is n't civilized to let them suffer just because they ca n't work any more . " It costs many millions to run our poorhouses , cruelly and inadequately , they say . It was an  | incident that happened under his own view , in a poorhouse , that caused magistrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eagles ' leader in the five-yearlong fight for old age pensions in New York . " I was at a poorhouse one day when an old couple came in , as fine old people as you ever saw . They were asked a lot of questions , and then a clerk said to the old man , " ' You come with me , please . We 'll go over to the men 's side . ' " ' And you 'll go over to the women 's side , ' they said to the little old woman . " It was all done kindlily . But the kindest words would have been cruel . That old couple had n't been apart one night in over 5o years , but now they had lost their right to be with each other . " I looked up their case . He was a farmer and they had raised three sons and sent them out into the world . But two sons died . And then the youngest son came home , sick , with tuberculosis . Dad and Mother helped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The savings went for the sick son . Before the young man died even the furniture in the house was under a chattel mortgage . After the funeral well , there was n't anything for the two old folks to do but to go to the poorhouse . " You never saw anyone as be . wildered as those two old folks were . They just used to sit side by side , all day , hardly ever speaking . They seemed to be wondering , wondering and thinking . " It killed them . One night the brave old fellow , sitting in his chair , just dropped his chin on his chest and died right there . They took the news over to Mother . " ' Yes , ' she said quietly , ' I sensed he could n't endure it . I been waiting for him to go . ' " Her four men that she had taken care of for so long were finally tucked away , at last , for the long , long sleep . She died right there in her chair , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension provided in these new state laws . With this they can board with relatives or friends . " It 's funny how far old folks can . make a dollar stretch , " the Eagles tell you . " They do n't need very much just food and warmth and freedom in a room of their own .
