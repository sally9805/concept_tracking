txt The nest-dent and Congress have before them today a demand by the national economy committee to end " the racket of veterans ' relief , " which , it charges , now amounts to " a subsidy for a favored class that will destroy all confidence in the Government unless it is stopped . " The committee declares that more than $450,000,000 should he cut from the bill for the relief of World War veterans that has become a national budget expense . The national economy committee is composed mainly of World War veterans and has as its only official , with the title of executive secretary . Capt . Archibald Roosevelt , son of the former President . Its organizers were the men who launched the Military Training Camps Association and who went out from Plattsbhrg as the vanguard of volunteer officers for service in France . Many veterans receiving aid are not entitled to it , the committee declares . It holds that about $500. - 000,000 is being spent for relief of veterans who have not suffered any disability from war service . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered no disability in the war , " the committee says , " is not only an intolerable menace to the national credit , but reaches to the stability of popular government itself . Appropriations for veterans who were not disabled itt service are characterized by the committee as a " subsidy . " It charges that Government officials are " flinching " from any real effort to reduce expenditures for veterans ' relief ; that the authorities are subservient to " the minority group receiving this subsidy . " and that  --  the depreciation of the dollar in the international exchange is a direct result of these expenditures . The petition , which carries the names of 150 men , including Mr. John W. Davis , Mr. Joseph H. Choate Jr. , Mr. Philip J. Roosevelt and many others prominent in New York , stresses that they do not refer to " the so-called bonus , " to which they also are opposed , but to " the growing annual expenditures in the federal blidget. for veterans of the World War and the Spanish-American War . " Your petitioners represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government to meet this is : . sue is the ' chief cause of the prevailing , lack of confidence of the people ih the present conduct of their Federal Government , " it declares .
