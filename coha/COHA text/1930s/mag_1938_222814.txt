In Chicago this week visitors at the New Bauhaus found an exhibition of bewildering nameless objects : gadgets of wire , wood , sandpaper , linoleum , felt , rubber and ordinary paper cut in odd accordion-pleated patterns . These objects , which sometimes suggested the scraps left in cabinetmakers ' shops , and sometimes the more outlandish contraptions of Rube Goldberg , represented part of the first year 's work of the 70 students of the New Bauhaus . <P> They seemed so bizarre that hard-working Director Ladislaus Moholy-Nagy thought long before he decided to let the public examine them . But visitors who studied explanations of the work , discovered that the exhibit made sense , got a good insight into the methods by which Moholy-Nagy and his associates hope to revitalize U. S. architecture and U. S. design . <P> Determined to train students to make the most of native materials , Moholy-Nagy set them to creating original forms , to studying , blindfolded , the touch sensations of different objects . Cutting new forms from paper sounded easy until students tried it , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets . When designs came easily in paper , they began working in wood and stone , did creditable sculpture , designed " machines " of fantastic shape but of no practical use , studied patterns of light and motion in classes in photography . Creating new forms was easiest for young high-school graduates , hardest for students with art school training . With no grades given at the New Bauhaus , Moholy-Nagy last week expressed himself as highly satisfied , dropped only one boy .
