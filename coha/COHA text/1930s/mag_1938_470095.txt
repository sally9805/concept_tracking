MRS . STEVENS was calling on a friend in whom she sometimes confides . ' I do n't know what the world is coming to ! " she exclaimed . " The Nevinses are frantic over the way Harriet is drinking . John Smith , a business friend of Mr. Stevens ' , makes a beeline for the bar as soon as he leaves his office every day . By dinnertime he 's half-seas over . His wife is on the point of leaving him . " She paused , taking a deep breath , and went on . " And I 'm beside myself about my son Tom . He made such a brilliant record in college and his future promised to he so bright . Now it 's all shot to pieces and so is he . His father and I have tried everything we can think of to stop him from drinking . We 've scolded and pleaded , but nothing does any good . " What can we do about it ? " This instance is authentic except for the names . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public-health authorities are greatly concerned . Bulletins from the Bureau of Census report that during the year 1936 more than eleven per cent of the 101,462 first admissions to all public and private mental hospitals in this country were alcoholic patients . A circular from the National Committee on Mental Hygiene states that between the years 1920 and 1934 first admissions for alcoholics in some metropolitan districts increased as much as seven hundred per cent ; and that between 1930 and 1934 they multiplied by a hundred and seventeen per cent . Nor do these latter figures simply bearwitness to the revolt against prohibition ; the number of first admissions in 1935 topped that of 1934 by two hundred and fifty . These figures do not include the number of persistent cases kept on from one year to another ; nor the incurables who must remain forever within the gates ; nor the uncounted men and women in general hospitals and at home who are suffering from organic ailments brought on by heavy drinking ; nor that multitude of chronic inebriates who drift out from the slums to spend much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prison authorities say , make up the greater part of the week-end guest lists of our city and county jails . The records of the municipal courts of New York City reveal that during the past year 7590 men and 796 women were given from their second to their tenth sentences for being drunk and disorderly or for minor crimes committed while they were drunk ; and on the same charges , 661 men and 86 women served from their eleventh to their forty-eighth terms behind the bars . At Bellevue Hospital , which is the clearing house for all classes of the city 's miscreants in need of medical care , no less than forty per cent of the twenty-five thousand admissions for the year 1936 were alcoholics . While New York can not be made a national measuring rod , the reports of the courts and hospitals in several other large cities and in a number of the middle-sized ones approach the same percentage . What is more to the point , we have today a growing legion of excessive drinkers in the more prosperous classes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger ones . For this fact we scarcely need the conclusive evidence of the welfare societies and the doctors . There are few of us who do not know of men like John Smith , or of young people like Tom Stevens and Harriet Nevins , whose parents and friends are asking , in desperation , " What can we do about it ? " The question is not new except in its proportions . The reason that we have never found the answer to it is that we have never looked for it in the right place . " No problem of our national life , " says an eminent physician who has made alcoholism his special study , " has been handled with so much useless effort . The whole attempt to cure excessive drinking has been shot through with utter futility owing to the indifference or muddled thinking of the general public and to the bias and ignorance of those who have made it their own private province of reform . " Alcoholism , " he insists , " is not a vice but a disease . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill with a mental malady . If taken in time he can often be cured . The spread of the disease can be stemmed and turned back , but only with the aid of the doctors and the psychologists who have made it their field of research and experiment . To try to do so by sumptuary laws is like trying to cure and prevent tuberculosis with ? cough-drop . " His opinion is shared by other medical experts . In a paper read at the last International Congress on Mental Hygiene , Dr. Hermann Bouman , Professor of Psychiatry and Neurology at the University of Amsterdam , and Director of that city 's mental clinics , said : " Alcoholism is one of the three great diseases , of which the other two are syphilis and tuberculosis . ... For prevention , treatment , and after care ? the three points of attack offered by any disease ? we shall have to invoke the assistance of psychology , sociology , andbiology . No work can be done in this field without a knowledge of the symptoms in each of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of this disease ? Generally speaking , alcoholism is a condition by which the afflicted person loses command of himself and , to one degree of another , of his mental faculties . While it is induced by the drinking of alcoholic liquor , the drinking is only . a symptom of a deeper-seated malady , the source of which is a maladjustment in the drinker 's personality ? that is , in the full circle of his physical , mental , emotional makeup . This " imbalance , " as the doctors know it , affects him in such a way that he is unable to face the difficulties confronting him in his daily life . In the impulse to avoid what he can not handle he seeks refuge in alcohol until , caught up by it , he begins to deteriorate . Since the seed of the disease is the maladjustment , the logical cure must lie in bringing this to the surface in each individual case , explaining it . to the patient and helping him to overcome it . With the compulsion out of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be misleading to claim that all forms of alcoholism may be healed by this or any other method . Some human beings are so naturally unequal to the conflicts of living that , in the light of present knowledge , little can be done for them except to protect them from the disturbing issues which cause them to drink . There are also the extreme cases , the psychotics whom alcohol has removed into the obscure recesses of the abnormal . Their cure is problematical and is the business of the psychiatrist and physician alone . For any layman to attempt to explain such cases would be dangerous ; even the most distinguished medical scientists still disagree about them . By far the greater number of heavy drinkers , however , belong in a class whose ailment can he more easily corrected . They are the men and women ? we all know them ? in whom the habit of excess has grown until their health , their business , their home life , and their peace of mind are in jeopardy . They are those whom the psychologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing them , mentions in his book To Drink or Not to Drink as " problem drinkers . " For them there is more than an even chance of cure in a comparatively new kind of mental therapy now being practiced by trained psychologists who , through study and trial , have brought it to a high degree of efficacy . If we are to understand this treatment we shall have to begin by examining the source of the disease , the maladjustment and its origins . Biologists on the whole have now come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as a born drunkard . But alcohol , they contend , may impair the germ plasm in such a way that the normal development of children conceived by parents whose blood is saturated with it may be impeded . And if the children escape that handicap their nervous and emotional stability may be affected . The effect may even skip a generation and become active in the grandchildren . In any event heredity may involve the tendency to drink . There is weight of evidence , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early training and environment are much more important . In a recent study of a hundred alcoholic patients made by Dr. James Hardin Wall of Bloomingdale Hospital in Westchester , New York , he found that seventy-one of them had had one or more excessive drinkers among their close relatives in the two preceding generations . Twenty-seven of them had had alcoholic fathers . " One can not say definitely , " said Dr. Wall , " that the tendency to drink excessively is inherited , but these figures are significant for this particular group . " Yet he pointed out another fact which came out in the study : that thirty-seven of the patients had had mothers whose exaggerated emotional attitudes had been manifested in spoiling , pampering , indulging , and overprotecting them . The late Richard R. Peabody of Boston , who was a pathfinder in this field , placed the heavier burden of blame on the early life of the drinker . He gave it as his experience that " seldom did a child whose parents maintained an intelligent attitude toward him mature into a drunkard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude has been distinctly abnormal . " And he added that the inclination to drink depended largely upon whether or not a person , as a child , had been taught to believe in and rely upon himself ; or whether he had been frightened , neglected , or spoiled , and had thus grown up out of key with his surroundings and with feelings of inferiority . Psychologists are now of one voice in their opinion that , in one variety or another , and as an outgrowth of maladjustment , this feeling of inferiority is the driving power behind inebriety . The initial injury may be inflicted upon the personality of the young in uncounted ways . Fears , planted by the telling of scare stories for the sake of obedience ; unreasoned punishments ; too rigid discipline ; scenes of violence or of accident ? any of these may break the spirit of a child , robbing him of his faith in himself and others , and thus setting up a habit of evasion . Neglect and loneliness may drive him in upon himself , making him surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unimaginative parents , who misunderstand his flights of fancy and punish him for them on the charge that he is lying , may suffer the dulling of talents that would have been his natural outlet of expression . Over-indulgence may inflate the young ego , fostering self-importance and arrogance , and giving a child the habit of depending upon externals for his satisfactions , so that his inner resources remain untapped . At the other end of the scale are the children of the underprivileged who ? through generations perhaps ? have been underbred , overcrowded , and poorly nourished until little of the stuff of resistance is to be found in them . These early conditionings ? and there is a long list of them ? may so disintegrate the personality of the child that in later life when he is subjected to any sudden or steady pressure he will be overcome by his feeling of inadequacy and will turn to some form of escape or sustenance outside of himself . It may be drugs or sex , or some other medium of excess . If destiny is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quite often it will be drink that lie turns to for his escape . III The inferiority complex which puts the tendency to drink into action may take any one of numerous forms . No generalization can cover all of these . The form which the complex will take will depend upon the personality of the individual drinker , his own peculiar circumstances and conflicts . To the sensitive and lonely ? most likely they are introverts ? who are touched by the pain of the world or of conditions about them and realize they can do nothing about these , alcohol is an anodyne for reality . With the surface shy , who are friendly by nature but find it difficult to unbend , it acts as a tonic , lifting them out of themselves and making it easier for them to unbend in company . The spoiled and the selfish , stung by the rebuffs they bring upon themselves , drink to restore their deflated egos . Domestic infelicity , business worries , or any circumstance creating self-pity or a sense of persecution , may lead to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological impotency or abnormal obliquities ? often the result of puritanical upbringing or lack of proper sex instruction ? are accountable for many cases of alcoholism . Those whose wills were completely subjugated in childhood will sometimes actually enjoy making promises to themselves to stop drinking , for the express purpose of breaking them because of the release they get in havingtheir own way . The feeling of hopelessness and defeat which comes from unemployment and want is directly related to drinking . Social ambition , which arises out of the individual 's feeling that his own position is inferior , has had much to do ? so some psychologists claim ? with the spread of drinking among women and young people . Alcohol does let down the bars and it creates peculiar kinships . The thirsty at the top will condescend to drink with those on the lower rungs of the ladder as they then are free from the condemnation they are likely to meet with in their own class . In some measure , we are told , the style-makers and the society editors help to cast this bait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocktail dress " and the " cocktail hat " to be worn at the cocktail hour , or candid-camera shots of the drinking activities of " cafe society " may have a high suggestive power for the unsure whose desire is to be fashionable at all costs . If we were living in a world where the pace of life was steady and men were more at peace within themselves , the margin of safety might be wider and more assured . In this swiftly moving era with its sudden changes , its competition and insecurity , even the man with a well-integrated personality will try to get away from them . He may do this through outdoor exercise or sports , congenial company , books , the theater , gardening , music , or some other art or hobby . He may even feel the need of a bracer from time to time , and yet be far from any danger of alcoholism . The unstable personality , on the other hand , is not satisfied with such modes of release . He seeks excitement , and his very infirmity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as there is no single typeof drinker , there is no specific technic for healing all drinkers . Each case must be considered apart and according to its distinctive elements . But there is a general procedure which is proving highly successful in the healing of " problem drinkers , " First of all , the patient must wish to be cured . As another preliminary , his family , if it can be so induced , must assist the therapist in the effort to find out as much as possible about the patient 's background , and must also assist the patient in carrying out the program of rehabilitation . If his home life is favorable it may be best not to detach him from it ; if , on the other hand , it is disturbing he may best be removed to an environment where he can have the necessary peace and quiet , More and more the therapists are finding that the atmosphere of the country tends to be more conducive to cure than that of the city with its distractions and involved mechanisms . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have become a habitual heavy drinker . You realize that you have reached a point in your drinking where your entire life is being affected by it . You are having trouble with your family because of your frequent intoxication . Your business is going to pieces . Your friends are turning from you . You are jittery and constantly on edge . You try to stop drinking and the more you try to stop the more you drink . You decide to do something about it . You have been hearing about this new mental therapy and you are Ied to consult a recognized psychologist who is known to have practiced it with success . Before accepting you he will insist that you be given a complete physical examination by a physician with whom he will consult , if and when necessary , on any psychiatric or medical aspects that may appear in your condition . When he has learned something of your family life he will decide whether or not it is wise for you to remain at home during your treatment . Whichever way his decision goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same course . But in order to make it more explicit we will take you to a farm in mind where many men once thought to be hopeless inebriates have found their healing . In the center of a rolling wooded country , this farm is near enough to the sea to have the tang of salt in the air . The " guest " house and dining-cottage are on a hill affording a vista of held and upland . There are vegetable gardens , a stable with mounts , a garage , kennels , a piggery , and round the farmhouse where the therapist and his family make their home is a large flower garden . All of these will have a part in your treatment , as you will soon learn . Upon your arrival you will have a long talk with the director in which he will explain what it is that is wrong with you , and he will give you a general sketch of what Iies ahead . He is not interested in your drinking but in what made you drink and what it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what you are you have shied away from everything that threatened to upset you . You have probably dodged your responsibilities , and as a means of avoiding what you could not face , you took to liquor . The reason why you have not been able to stop is because you have been fooling yourself with rationalizations . No doubt you have been told so often that you are a weakling and a failure that you have come to believe it and have lost confidence in yourself . The truth is that your admission that you have been in the wrong , your desire to be put right , and your willingness to devote yourself exclusively to that end are evidence of your courage and intelligence . You are now going to work with the therapist to find out what has been to blame for your false attitudes . For the first time , through an understanding of yourself , you are going to learn something about reality . In this new life alcohol will have no place . You will have to accept the fact that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it " spells disaster for you just as sugar spells disaster for the diabetic . " After a while , when its narcotic effects wear off , you will not miss it . In some details , this therapist has evolved a technic of his own . In his experience he has found that placing an alcoholic patient in an institution is often only transferring him from one kind of imprisonment to another . In order to avoid giving you any such feeling , he makes few personal restrictions . The " guests , " as he calls them , are free to come and go on notice . But there is one rule which you can not break if you wish to remain on the farm . You can not bring any liquor there or go outside to drink . If you want a drink he will give you one . He may even place a glass of whiskey on your bedside table on the first and second evenings after your arrival . He has never had a case in which on the second morning the drink has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is a long step toward restoring the morale of a drinker , as he has a secret pride in the thought that he is becoming the master of himself . " Your daily routine will now become the antidote for the irregularity and lack of responsibility with which drinking has marked your life . You will eat and sleep regularly and you will have a well-considered plan of work , exercise , and recreation . After breakfast at half past seven you will spend the morning out of doors . And you will not be idle , for you will dig and plow the soil , sow and plant , tend and water the farm and gardens , and gather the crops . Or if you are fond of animals , you may clean the stables and kennels and look after the dogs and the horses . In winter , when there is little farming to do , digging trenches will take the place of gardening . It will not be long before you begin to feel like a different person . The perspiration induced by your hard work will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exercise will strengthen your muscles . The oxygen in the air will put new life into you , sharpening your appetite so that the balanced diet of food rich in vitamins will have the chance to build up your health . Your shattered nerves will begin to pull themselves together . When night comes you will be so tired that it will not be difficult for you to relax and you will have an untroubled sleep . And you willbe helped in other ways . " For those who have been used to scattering their energies , " say the psychologists , " there is no better means of co-ordination than having to do a certain thing at the same time every day , and no better tonic for a slackened sense of responsibility than the performance of one disagreeable task a day . " Yet all of this , while essential to your cure , is only supplementary , clearing the way and making you ready for it as you go on to its intrinsic necessities . For it is in the afternoons or during the week-ends when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or camping out with him on hunting or fishing trips , that he brings his strategy to play on opening up your mind . In this there will be neither coercion nor pressure . It will be that , having established your trust in him , he will he able by casual but leading questions to take you back through the run of your life , down to your earliest recollections and up again through childhood and adolescence to the present . Every step of the way he will be exploring your mind for the events and reactions which swung your personality out of balance and made a mental and emotional misfit of you . What these may be one can not foretell . The cause may lie in some incident or long-drawn-out compulsion the mark of which has remained everpresent with you . It may be something that you have never been aware of . It may come easily to the surface or it may be embedded in the unconscious , eluding your conscious mind . But if you are persevering and the therapist is patient , you will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be little about you that has not been revealed . The therapist will know your likes and dislikes , your perplexities , your inclinations , your prejudices , and your aptitudes and potential talents . He will know the traits in your character which need to be played up and those which need to be toned down , and he will have a full knowledge and understanding of the immediate issues in your adult life which , because of your disability , have dictated your flight into alcoholism . One by one , as your conflicts and your confusions are revealed , they will be clarified and you will be shown how to think through to their solutions . With the cause of your illness removed , its symptoms will disappear . You will no longer have the impulse or the disposition to drink . As the obstacles to clear thinking are removed , your vision will be able to project itself into reality . You will no longer look at life through dimmed windows . You will have a new outlook , new aims , and satisfactions . New and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . A constructive philosophy will replace your old defeatism . In short , your whole personality will be overhauled and swung into balance , and you will be a well-integrated human being , self-respecting , self-reliant , and sure of your ability to carry on without the aid of artificial stimuli . The time this will take will be measured by your capacity for adjustment . If you are naturally articulate and expansive and can easily be led to talk about yourself , if you enter spontaneously into the program of your cure , the time required for your recovery may be only three or four months . If you are reticent and inclined to hold out against the pro . gram , thereby keeping the maladjustment behind closed doors , the therapist may have some difficulty in opening them . Your cure then may be a long process . One thing he will make sure of , somewhere along the line , is that you have a real desire to be cured for your own sake and not merely for the sake of someone whom you wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disturb you , this may become your excuse for returning to liquor . Finally , you will be fully and permanently healed only when you are able to see others drink without any thought of doing so yourself . And in order to validate your recovery , there will be a period of after-care in which the therapist will keep in touch with you , giving you advice until suchtime as he sees that his hand is no longer needed on your elbow . Now then , what about prevention ? It is not the purpose of this article to go into the intricacies of child guidance . A review of what inadequate parents may do to impair the integrity of their children has already been indicated . The child who is scarred in the matrix may be marked for frustration . And early impressions go deep . Childhood is a world of little things . Slight neglects and misunderstandings , although they may escape significance in the adult mind , often have magnitude for the sensitive young . Their deepest need is for understanding and wise affection ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confidence in their parents , so unshakable that they will not be afraid to question them upon any subject , with the certainty that the response will be sincere and intelligent . As a rule , people do not start out to make a career of drinking . Some may begin by getting drunk deliberately to offset some sudden shock or to avoid some pressure in their lives . Most topers have become so by getting in the habit of taking a drink or two to set them up . But alcoholism is insidious in its attack . It creeps up on its victims , and it is selective , choosing only those who are the more readily induced to surrender . And they of course are the maladjusted who have a tendency toward the disease and in whom the symptom of drinking is easily aggravated . Alcohol , like any other narcotic , is of course a habit-forming chug . The well-balanced will not lend themselves to such a habit . The unbalanced personality forms the habit without realizing it . The speed with which alcoholism approaches depends largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life the drinker leads . It may come on rapidly ; by contrast , the man who eats food rich in vitamins , eliminates thoroughly , and takes plenty of outdoor exercise may build up an immunity permitting him to drink a quart or more of whiskey a day ? though sooner or later , in most such instances , the immunity reaches the breaking point and the deterioration is rapid . " To-day , " says Dr. Walter Treadway , Assistant Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service , " approximately eighty per cent of inebriate men and sixty per cent of inebriate women have the drink habit well set before thirty years of age , and approximately half of them before the age of twenty-five . " Now it stands to reason if you have a tendency toward tuberculosis you are not going to court the conditions which will make a consumptive of you . You will be careful not to take cold and you will build up your system so that it may resist the infiltration of the tubercular germ into your blood . Alcoholism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet it becomes active through the saturation of your blood with alcohol . An important preventive measure then is to preclude this saturation by not forming the habit of drinking . For the safety that lies in this discretion the mental hygienists offer a few simple suggestions : The time not to take a drink , they say , is when you think you need one . Otherwise you may come to Took on the bottle as a release from every vexation , no mat. ter how slight . They advise you to avoid taking a drink at the same time every day or making a practice of week-end drinking parties . They advise against drinking in the daytime , except for a glass of wine with luncheon ; and even that may be unwise if you are naturally " intolerant " to alcohol . They condemn the early morning drink after a night out , arguing that the old saw about " the hair of the dog that bit you " has added many recruits to the hosts of alcoholism . They advise drinkers to watch themselves for their capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes you boisterous , quarrelsome , or melancholy , or affects your heart or your nerves , they say you can be sure that you belong among those who can not take it . And finally they warn you that when you find it is becoming increasingly difficult for you to do without liquor it is time for you to consult your doctor : you have reached the danger point . V Obviously the only valid and practical way to combat alcoholism is to make the treatment and the knowledge of what alcoholism is and how it takes root generally available . Thus far little has been done . Some of the States and a few of the cities have up-to-date mental hospitals where alcoholics in the advanced stages are given the care they need . In most public hospitals the inebriate is held until he has sobered up and then allowed to go his way without any attempt having been made to help him . A few private hospitals have alcoholic wards with competent staffs , but the charges are prohibitive to the small income . Although the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them have given this peculiar affliction the highly specialized study it demands . And of the trained therapists of the kind we have mentioned , who have specialized in the treatment and cure of the " problem " drinker , there are only a few . Such neglect is a social waste and an economic blunder . Many of our young liquor addicts are intelligent and gifted . Because of their deterioration their talents come to nothing , and there is the chance that they may perpetuate their tendencies in their children . At the other extreme are the strays of the earth , the inebriate poor , who keep on breeding their kind , swelling the list of the ineffective , and adding to the burden of private and public charity . That this can be mitigated is seen in what is being done in other countries . Some years ago in Holland , where the manufacture of liquor is an important factor in the nation 's economy , the authorities saw that something had to be done about the growth of intemperance among the people . A commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a study of alcoholism and the conditions surrounding it . As a result of the investigation the government called a conference of public-health officials and representatives of the liquor industry , and a complete program of control was inaugurated . Alcoholic wards with specialists in attendance were installed in public hospitals . Free clinics where the intemperate are given treatment and where their relatives may come for counsel have been established in the cities and in key villages in the rural districts . Intoxication is now a dwindling problem in Holland . Our Public Health authorities have produced a tentative program for the United States . It places special emphasis on the need for a non-political commission of physicians , psychiatrists , psychologists , and social scientists which would make a thorough study of the disease both here and abroad , find out what is being successfully done to combat alcoholism in its every phase , pass this knowledge on , and serve as a consulting board for the Bureaus of Mental Hygiene which are advocated as an adjunct to the Department of Public Health in every State . The proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities , for graduate physicians and psychologists who are fitted to specialize in the treatment of alcoholism ; and to meet the growing need of patients in the lower-income groups , alcoholic wards in public hospitals , and consultation clinics such as those which are now operating in Holland . Another suggestion calls for the co-operation of the liquor industry and the public health authorities toward honest advertising based on medical and social fact . And the plan includes also an educational campaign ? one that would not seek to attack drinking or the drinker , but would be a sincere effort to enlighten parents and the public on what causes excess and how the tendencies can be avoided and overcome . For fifty years we have bungled the alcohol problem in America . Once again the reformers are stirring . From the platform and the pulpit and in the press they are stating the case for prohibition . Might it not be wise for a change to bring a little honest knowledge and common sense to bear upon the situation by letting the scientists have their chance to work it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tithe as much as the prohibition debacle . And it might be successful .
