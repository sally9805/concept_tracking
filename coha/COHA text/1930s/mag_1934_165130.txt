One fine January morning 27 years ago the Idaho legislature elected William Edgar Borah to the U. S. Senate . Among his colleagues today Senator Borah is senior member in point of service . To the press gallery he is the Senate 's No. 1 orator and to historians the Senator most likely to be remembered in their future chronicles of this era . But to U. S. Presidents from Roosevelt to Roosevelt " Bill " Borah has always been the Great Opposer . Last week the Senator from Idaho arose to his immemorial task and demonstrated that the New Deal was to be no exception in his crusade against the White House . <P> Rooseveltian candor , Rooseveltian liberalism , Rooseveltian charm , some people thought , had insensibly softened stern Critic Borah . His favorite topic , unforgiveness of War debts , was practically shelved by the new Administration . Relief was being doled in quantities of which he approved . He championed silver and the President gave him and his fellows the Silver Purchase Act . When the Recovery Act was under debate he succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NRA codes to " permit monopolies or monopolistic practices " - and then ultimately voted against the measure . He joined Senator Nye in attacking NRA as a promoter of monopoly at the expense of " the little fellow " and the President gave him the Darrow board to investigate his complaints . <P> Last week Senator Borah , with the President at sea and Congress scattered , remained in Washington , as he has often done before , to seize a good opportunity for publicizing his views . Before a microphone he poured out his ringing phrases from coast to coast and once more became Borah the Great Opposer . Points on which he gave the New Deal a thorough flaying : <P> Dictatorship . " The most brutal system of government yet developed is vast capital linked to personal or arbitrary power . It is under a constitutional government alone , a government of law and order , that the rights and liberties of the average man and woman are , or can be , preserved and enjoyed . . . . Their rights are being constantly chiseled away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their freedom and political rights more and more limited , in Europe under dictatorships and in democracies under bureaucracies . . . . <P> " It was the practice of Augustus Caesar , when preparing to take over some new bloc of power , to deliver a eulogy on the virtues of the republic and announce his deep solicitude for the liberties and happiness of the people . How faithfully this fine precedent has been emulated in the modern world by dictators and bureaucrats alike ! "
