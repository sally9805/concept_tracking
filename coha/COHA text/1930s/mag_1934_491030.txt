18 YHE IV JATER pictures of Russia are clearer , and yet they are so hazy as to be enveloped in a glamour so great that , in looking back , it all appears dreamlike , almost unreal , and I have to make an effort to realize that I was actually there and lived it . all , not merely imagined it . Tsarskoe , Peterhof , Krasnoe , St. Petersburg  --  that was the setting , but the pictures I see are detached , merge one into the other , pass before my mind in little bits . Dates , circumstances , the whys and wherefores are all vague  --  entirely vague . The family was a large one . My mother had five brothers living : Alexander , Vladimir , Alexis , Serge and Paul . Her eldest brother , Nicolas , had died at Nice as quite a young man  --  of consumption , I have been told . Four brothers were already married in the days I am speaking of . In addition , there were no end of other uncles , aunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I never quite made out who they all were , especially as they were of several generations ; two or three great-uncles and aunts being still alive . Some were of lesser importance  --  uncles , aunts and cousins several times removed , descendants of side lines  --  but for all big occasions , for feast days , for parades and church ceremonies , the family would flock together and there would be huge family meetings , a regular review of uncles , aunts and cousins near or far-removed , as numerous as trees in a wood . This was most interesting , but also very confusing , as we came almost as strangers into this great family gathering , and everybody exclaimed about how much we had grown , and so on . Nothing could have been a greater contrast than the English and Russian uncles and aunts . I must confess that in my childhood the Russian uncles were surrounded by a much greater glamour . Our admiration for them was not unmixed , however , with dread ; they were so formidably tall , big and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The English uncles were absent-minded , they looked through you ; the Russian relations never looked through you  --  in fact. , they were , if anything , too aware of your existence and teased you mercilessly ; always , on all occasions , public or otherwise , they teased you . The Lighter Side of an Emperor I T WOULD carry me too far to begin to describe them all , but some of their faces are still so vivid , so full of interest for me , at least , that I must draw some of their portraits , make them live once more as I saw them . There was Uncle Sasha , Emperor Alexander III , a giant of a man , broad , powerful , good-natured , kindly , less terrible than some of the uncles , in spite of his crown and of his over-life-size . He had a chestnut beard and kindly blue eyes , his way with us children was jovial and encouraging , and 1 remember him particularly in connection with some special fun he had imagined would amuse both the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his sons learned how to climb and handle ropes and sails , still an essential part of ships in those days . To guard against bad falls , a net had been stretched beneath this mast . Uncle Sasha loved a good laugh , so he had come upon the absurdly delightful idea of taking his guests out after lunch to this net and making them run and jump about on it . I can remember no game that ever made us laugh as much as this one , and the fun reached its climax when giant Uncle Sasha , whose weight was formidable , climbed onto the net himself . This was the superlative moment of excitement that we children always waited for with a delight not unmixed with fear . Uncle Sasha would pursue us over this net , and when he had cornered you he would jump up and down , and his weight made you bounce like a ball . Higher and higher you bounced , as though you had no weight at all , and you had hardly come down to your feet before there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down , up and down , shrieking and laughing , terrified and enchanted ; a game for the gods . That was Uncle Sasha as we saw him ; I leave it to history to make whatever other portrait it chooses . Aunt . Minnie , his wife , was Queen Alexandra 's sister . Without having her beauty , she had Aunt Alix 's charm . She was deliciously amiable and much loved , but she does not play a great part in my memories , though she is the only one of that huge family cirele still alive as I write these lines . She was a devoted mother and wife , and truly the center of her world , both at home and as empress . In those days there were five cousins , Nicky , Georgie , Xenia , Misha and Olga , who was quite small . Nicky we always loved and admired ; although , being older , he was rather beyond our reach in those days . Already , at that early age , he had that gentle charm and that kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life till the day of his tragic death . Kindly and peace-loving , he did not seem cut out for a rate so horrible . My Russian Cousins OEORGIE , like my mother 's eldest brother , died of consumption as quite a young man  --  somewhere in the Caucasus , I believe . Xenia was a dear chum , being a year older than I was . The other two , Misha and Olga , were younger than we . But it was with the other cousins that we were more intimate  --  the children of Uncle Vladimir and Aunt . Miechen . Uncle Vladimir was my mother 's second brother . He was the dark-haired one of the family , exceedingly good-looking , but a little less tall than his brothers . Aunt Mieehen , his wife , was born Princess of Mecklenburg ; although not a regular beauty , she was one of the most fascinating women that ever crossed my path . There was , I believe , a certain rivalry between Aunt Mieehen and Aunt Minnie , and less friendship and good understanding than was politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vividly remember . Here there were four cousins  --  three boys , Kirin , Boris and Andr6 , and one daughter , Ellen . They were the most beautiful children imaginable and our T H E S A T U R D A Y E V E N I N G P O E T friendship outlasted our youth . Much later in life , sister Ducky married Kirill . Uncle Alexis , mama 's third brother , was the bachelor of the family . He was of the type of the Vikings , and would also have made a perfect Lohengrin as Wagner would have dreamed of him . Fair beard , blue eyes , enormous , a superb specimen of humanity , he was , besides , a sailor , and had a true sailor 's love for all the good things of life and of beautiful women in particular . There was an aunt several limes removed who was his " adored " for many years , although she was not free . Zino was her name , and she was terribly fascinating . Her eyes were enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips cherry red , and dark circles made her wonderful Oriental eyes still more dangerously languorous . There was a photograph in papa 's room of Zina in Russian court dress with a racoshnie on her head . I was irresistibly attracted by this picture of lovely Aunt Zinn of the mysterious eyes , and I could never make up my mind if it was her eyes or her stupendous jewels that fascinated me most . . t1 Neotar.Forgotten Compliment SHE , too , belonged to Russia 's splendid , was a ? characteristic product of the world she lived in . Aunt Zina , who was a sister of the celebrated General Skobelev , and married to a Leuchtenberg , was never considered quite one of the imperial family . She would have made her fortune on the screen as a vamp , but her good nature entirely belied her vamplike appearance . It was the sailor uncle who paid me my first compliment , and I assure you I have never forgotten it . It was at Peterhof , and we children came rushing over the lawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was leading the onrush , and as we came , Uncle Alexis exclaimed : " Ah ! void la jolie petite ! " I was " la : Idle petite , " and from then onward I never Forgot this ? But the couple who fascinated me most were Uncle Serge and Aunt Ella . They were newly married in those days . and her beauty and sweetness was a thing of dreams . Uncle Serge was the brother nearest in age to my mother . She had bean brought up with him and Uncle Paul together . In contrast to the three eldest , who , although hugely tall , were broad and thickset , this uncle was as tall and slim as the proverbial fir tree . He was by far the most frightening of all the uncles , but , for all that , was our chosen favorite . The extreme adorableness of his wife had , perhaps , something to do with it , but , anyhow , Uncle Serge meant a great deal to us . His name in history will . I fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death was violent and fearful , but 1 have nothing to do with Grand Duke Serge , governor of Moscow , who was blown up by Nihilists ; the Uncle Serge I have to do with was severe , kept you in awe , but he loved children , although he was not destined to have any of his own . Ho scolded us and never let an offense pass unnoticed , but whenever he was able , he came to see us in our bath  --  a concession that , for some reason , all children try to obtain from their elders  --  or to tuck us up in our beds and to kiss us good night . Uncle Serge wore a close-cropped , fair beard ; his lips were thin and closed in a firm line that was almost cruel . Especially in the long , dark-green tunic , baggy trousers , high boots and small white astrakhan cap of his full-dress uniform , he was a magnificent , though somewhat forbidding , figure . As abrupt of movement as he was short of speech , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the fingers of one hand clasping the wrist of the other , making a chain bracelet he wore continually jingle against his cuff . His eyes were steely-gray and his pupils could narrow like those of a cat , till they became mere pin points , and then there was something almost menacing about him . But , oh , how handsome he was ; so inconceivably upright , with such a. magnificent figure ; though , no doubt , there seas in his face something of the fanatic that he was at heart . But when I looked up at him with the confident , adoring eyes of a little girl who knew naught . of the hard , cruel and unkind things of this world , his steely eyes would soften for a moment ; though , perhaps , his look never became really warm or reassuring . I must admit that even at his sweetest moments there was nothing soft nor particularly encouraging about Uncle Serge ; there was a tyrant within him , ready at any moment to burst forth ; there was something intolerant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his teeth were clenched . Beauty and the Bear DRY nervous , short of speech , impatient , he had , none of the rather careless good humor of his three elder brothers ; he was , in fact , completely another type . But for all that , we loved him , felt irresistibly attracted to him , hard though he could be . Few , perhaps , cherish his memory , but I do . In contrast to her severe lord and master  --  and in this case these terms may be taken literally  --  Aunt , or Cousin , Ella was all sweetness and feminine charm . By birth , though a good many years our senior , she was our first cousin , being the daughter of my father 's second sister , the late Grand Duchess Alice of Hess . By marriage she became our aunt , and as we were much younger , at an age when a few years make a difference , we generally gave her her dignity of aunt .. Uncle Serge was often abrupt and severe with her , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being very young and innocent when she married him , he had something of the schoolmaster attitude toward her , and I can still see the adorable blush that would suffuse her cheeks when he reproved her , and he did this often , no matter where or before whom . " Mae , Serge ? " she would then exclaim , and the expression of her face was like that of a schoolgirl detected in some fault . Only to remember her still makes my heart melt within me . She , too , had wonderful jewels ; and Uncle Serge , who worshiped her in spite of his scoldings , would invent all sorts of reasons and occasions for giving her magnificent presents ; she had , besides , a special talent for wearing her clothes , in a way quite her own . Of course everything suited her , for she was // " 1 ai n't kiddin ' myself , " he answered evenly . " It 's you that 's doin ' the kiddin ' of yourself . " " How come ?

" " That 's better , " I said . " But get this , Mick : That racket ai n't no part of me , an ' I ai n't no part of it . " " We 'll see . In the meantime , keep Mary happy , will you ? She 's got this shindig all planned . " tall , slim and incredibly graceful , and no blush rose could have competed with her complexion . There was also something of a lily about her ; her purity was absolute , one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parting from her in the evening , one longed for the hour when one would behold her again nest day . The Russian court dress was exceedingly picturesque , and was donned for all bigger occasions . It consisted of amply cut velvet robes over a tablier of white satin ; the shape , with its train and wide , long-hanging sleeves , had something medieval about it .. These robes were heavily embroidered in silver or gold , and were of every color of the rainbow ; the richest of all were of cloth of gold or silver . When Euery Woman Wore a Crown A halo-shaped ecteoshnic with a veil hanging from beneath it inevitably accompanied this costume , so that every woman appeared to have been crowned . This unity of attire made all Russian court gatherings uniquely picturesque , saturating them with color and brilliance unlike anything else ; veritable pictures out of the Thousand and One Nights . Byzantine in splendor , with all the mysterious gorgeousness of the East . In those days the processional entry of the Russian imperial family into festive hall or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Family gatherings , parades , banquets , church ceremonies  --  these are the pictures of festive Russia that , when I look back , flicker before my astonished child 's eye . " Sure , " I said , " Ill do that , Mickey . " We shook hands . " That alone shows you 're a pal , " he said . So that night I was host . It tore me up plenty . Mary spent most of the evening at my side . About three o'clock we were alone on the roof overlooking the street . I was tired , and maybe a bit high from the drinks . The town was sleeping below us . There is something about a sleeping city when you look down on the roofs . Quiet . Everything sort of hangs in the air until wakefulness rouses it all again . Maybe people would be better off if they slept a lot more . They would think of fewer things to try to do . But that something caught up with me there on the roof . I lit a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shortly Mary was there beside me . We did not say much , We just stood . And after a while I laid my hand over hers , there on the cold stone rail . She looked up at me . She seemed to sway on her feet . I put my arms around her and drew her close and kissed her full on the lips . She seemed to wilt to smoke in my arms . Just for that minute . There , alone , over a million sleeping humans with the same feelings and problems and hopes and burdens , we clung together like we were the only things on earth . I said , after a long while , " He ai n't the guy for you , anyway , Mary . I know he ai n't . He showed me that tonight , when he thought that all he was duing was reasoning things to the right answer . He ai n't got any heart at all . " " It was a mistake , " Mary whispered . " A terrible mistake . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to be with , sweetheart . I 'll tell ( Coned ' , Lawci from Page 19 ) Great fields with troops standing in endless rows , flags flying , music , trumpets , and the Czar riding slowly down the front . He says some magic word to each regiment as he passes and , as response , a thousand thousand voices mount toward the heavens with a shout . of joy . Behind him come innumerable grand dukes , generals , military followers . Uniforms of every color , and especially conspicuous the bright-red , eaftanlike mats , silver braiding and enormous fur caps of the Cossacks of the Guard ; a wonderful regiment mounted on small , disheveled , wild-looking horses whose heads are held curiously high by their riders , seated on their saddles as if on thrones . They are certainly by far the most picturesque of all the troops , and have about them an air of the steppes . There is something fierce and at the same time curiously gentlemanly about them , well in keeping with legends of waste lands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the Emperor and his suite comes the Empress in an open carriage drawn by four horses a /a Aliment . All in white , she smiles graciously in response to her share of the cheers . A grand duchess or an honored guest sits beside her . I have seen two empresses in succession driving thus down the front . The sun shines golden on the resplendent array ; it lights up in my memory a picture of might and splendor , of pomp and power , that has forever passed away . And if I close my eyes I can bear the deep and heart-stirring strains of the Russian anthem swelling toward heaven Mickey everything . I think he 'll understand . He really does n't love me. " " / do , " I said . " I always have . " " I know it , office boy , " she crooned through a wan smile . " I know it . I have known it for  --  months !

When I released her lips she said , " I 'll tell Mickey everything . We 'll have to do something . Divorce . Soon . I could n't lie to him  --  love you and remain his wife . " " No , " I said . " We 'll tell him . Tell him as soon as he gets back . " But we never did tell Mickey . We never did , because Mickey never got back . Just as I stated earlier , he reasoned everything perfectly up to his only mistake , and then did not live long enough to realize that he had been wrong in his figures . Mickey walked onto a spot . His powers of reason showed him that the outsiders had the edge . They had a profitable business that could be conducted in a hat , They made huge profits and operated with no central office , no records , no collections but cash . They needed no dummy corporations , no army of helpers , no protection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided they had better be insiders than outsiders . But he forgot to reason that one little angle . So , while we waited to tell him that we loved each other and wanted to marry , welearned of his miscalculation . Instead of a business conference , Mickey met a hearse . ( To DE CONCLUDED ) like a prodigious hymn . Of all national anthems , the Russian was the most solemn , the most impressive , the most compelling ; it made you catch your breath , stirred you to the very foundations of your being ; some deep emotion thrilled through you from head to foot . And here I am in church , a wee bit of a child , staring with wide-open eyes at the fantastic gorgeousness of the sanctuary in which the imperial family has come to petition or to render thanks unto God . , Among My Russian Reiatlues Gold everywhere , hundreds of lighted tapers , and before me the mysterious threshold over which a woman 's foot dare not tread , the Holy of Holies shut off by a rood screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I have no share . I am full of reverence , but feel small , of no consequence , almost an intruder ; all the others are at home here , but I am a little stranger , one to whom none of this is familiar . And as though to spread a veil before my eyes , clouds of incense float between me and all I see . Furtively I peep around me . What are the others feeling ? Those who belong here , those to whom all this fantastic splendor is nothing new ? Shyly my eyes search every face . Was there ever a nobler , more imposing company , men more huge , women more beautiful and more gorgeously attired , and where in the whole wide world could one see such jewels ? In the places of honor stand Uncle Sasha and Aunt Minnie  --  in those days Emperor and Empress . Her golden robe is all covered with silver embroidery , and she is crowned with a tiara of sapphires so large that they resemble enormous eyes ; cascades of pearls and diamonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only one amongst the royal ladies whose gown is barred by the blue Order of St. Andrew , whilst . all the grand duchesses wear the red ribbon of St. Catherine . There are also many more aunts and cousins , some old , some young , also some little girls and boys of my age ; but their faces are less clear than those of their elders . And what an array of uniforms ! How tall are all my uncles and Cousins ! I am almost afraid to look up at them , but bow superbly handsome sonic of them are . There are , it must also be confessed , one or two really ugly old uncles amongst them , but they are outnumbered by the others , are but shadows heightening their brilliance . My eyes drop them immediately to take possession once again of those who fascinate me like so many figures in an incredible dream . How intent they all are , how Full of worship , how reverent . God for them is a reality ; however crowned their heads may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than theirs . The curtains are drawn hack from before the altar doors ; priests , old and young , file down the steps . Dark , fair or gray , their hair is long and extraordinarily glossy , as are also their beards . They are as gorgeous as the rest . of the picture ; their vestments are of gold and silver , superbly woven with ancient designs ; the jeweled crosses on their breasts flash like living lights , and their faces strangely resemble the icons before which they bend  --  St. Nicholas , St. Andrew , St. John . The church is Full of the fumes of incense , and I am getting a little giddy ; unaccustomed to stand so long , my feet , begin to ache . I catch mama 's eye ; she smiles at me encouragingly , but puts a finger to her lips . " Patience , " she seems to say . Little Protestant that I am , I must not disgrace her ; then , turning again towards the priests , as one enraptured by some great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mama is at home here ; mama belongs to them ; her soul is theirs ; mama is part . of Russia  --  mama . Moving to Malta I shall return to Russia again later  --  but today , so as to proceed with a certain amount of order , and according to the years , I must move on to Malta , the paradise of our childhood . We embarked for Malta from Marseilles in October , Grandmama Queen had lent us for the voyage her yacht , II . M. S. Osborne , a beautiful boat , but not particularly steady in a heavy sea , and we had rough weather all the time  --  a three or four days ' crossing , if I remember rightly  --  but what I remember distinctly is that nearly everybody was very sick . Mama , although she disliked the sea , was an excellent sailor . In those days I was sometimes very sick , but never prostrate ; there were hours between the outbursts when I was perfectly well and happy . Ducky , my inseparable comrade , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Sandra was chirpy enough , I do not remember much about sister Beatrice in those days , for she was the baby and had a department all her own . To her three sisters , though she is now a mother of three big boys , she is Baby even today , and i1 is thus that we still call her . I remember as though it were yesterday our arrival at Malta . It is one of those pictures impressed upon my mind for all time  --  a wonderful picture , unforgettable , to he cherished to the end of my days . It was at the hour of sunset that we steamed into the beautiful old fortified harbor of Valetta . A gorgeous pageant spread before our eyes . As background , the mighty battlements partly hewn out of the rock itself , and at . their feet the whole Mediterranean fleet in festive array . In those days ships still had masts , which added to their beauty of line , and on those masts , one above the other , stood the bluejackets in long lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunting was out , and , as the Osborne . advanced slowly down the double row of battleships , each separate band struck up God Save the Queen . Life at San Antonio Sky and sea a glory of color , the earth all aglow , music , flags , cheering and , when anchorage was reached , papa waiting for us  --  papa at the height of his career , at the height also of his good looks . Papa with his deeply tanned face in which his eyes shone extraordinarily , fascinatingly blue . A sailor in every sense of the word , a sailor , an Englishman , a prince ! On the quay , surrounded by his military household , flanked by a red-coated guard of honor , stood old Sir Lintorn Simmons , governor of Malta , viceroy of the island , sovereign in Her Majesty 's stead . Old Sir Lintorn was the typical Englishman dear to foreign imagination ; red-faced , portly , with white whiskers , strapped into a tight scarlet uniform , crowned with cocked hat and white feathers , a cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was quits dark by the time we reached San Antonio , the governor 's summer palace , which had been given over to us during our stay . San Antonio , beloved house ! My father and mother were very popular at Malta , and Sun Antonio became the center of hospitality . Many guests went in and out of our house , and we received a giant share of their-attention . We made innumerable friends , mostly among the naval officers ; the fleet was , so to say , at our disposal , and we were continually visiting one ship or another , H. M. S. Alexandra , papa 's flagship , being our great favorite , her midshipmen becoming our particular chums . But it was our rides and riding parties especially that played the biggest part in our lives . Mama knew how to be severe and there was no pardon for certain misdeeds , but she also knew how to give us splendid liberty for harmless amusements . She had resigned herself to what she called " our insane passion " for riding , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-important in Malta , for this was , of course , long , long before the days of motoring , and nearly everybody in Malta possessed a horse . There was polo and racing and innumerable riding picnics to far parts of the island . The horse peculiar to Malta was the Barbary Arab . Spirited , blue-blooded little creatures , you often saw real beauties harnessed to the simplest earl . The characteristic Maltese vehicle is a small , flat , two-wheeled carriage , with a mattress or carpet spread over it and no seats ; the wheels are very high and the driver either sits or lies ou this mattress , unless he is seated on the shafts when his cart is full . They drive at a great pace and take enormous pride in their horses and even in their harness , The more civilized carriages were four-wheeled and four-seated , and shaded by a white , fringed awning which shook backwards over your head according to the bumps of the road . These are drawn by a pair , whilst the gocart is a one-horse vehicle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted bright scarlet , with gay patterns all over them , and are exceedingly picturesque and colorful . Enormous mules are harnessed to these ; the Maltese mules are the largest I have ever seen anywhere and are placid , patient , unemotional creatures , whilst the horses are small and fiery . Mama gave one of these Barbary Arabs to both of us elder sisters , whilst Sandra remained sole possessor of trustworthy Tommy , who exactly suited her size and temperament . The first horses found for us were not a success , for they were tricky or unreliable or had other defects . One was a gray called Gordon , who had a nasty way of trying to crush your legs against the high stone walls that border every Maltese road . There is no road in Malta that is not bordered by We were , of course , in ecstasies over each horse brought to us , but after having had a few failures , Robert , the coachman , found an adorable , high-spirited chestnut which became my own special mount , His mane and tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs , though spindielike , were hard as iron . He could he something of a beast , being a stallion , but I loved him with a jealous passion and called him Ruby , Life at Malta was marvelous , but Malta with Ruby en puss became paradise . Ruby was the culminating enchantment of that blessed isle . Boots and Saddles Ducky , after having first possessed a gray called Stuart and a lovely , but unsound , golden chestnut . called Scout , was given a handsome bay which she christened Fearless . Ruby and Fearless became the center of our lives , and our love for them was ecstasy to ourselves , but often an irritation to those who considered our passion exaggerated . It was difficult to keep us out of the stables and we were often found elbow deep in bran squash , helping the stable people mix this delicious mess for our favorites . The groom who accompanied us on rill our adventures had the cheerful name of Hoblaa which was entirely in keeping with his round , rosy face . Hobbs was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignant at our pranks . Our ideas about riding were anything but civilized . We were entirely fearless and our chief pace was Full gallop , quite regardless of the ground . The only soft ground in Malta was the race course called the Massa , where we went almost daily except Saturdays , which were picnic days . These wiry little Arabs had legs of steel , and / never remember Ruby having had anything the matter with him except once , when I rode him through a pool of lime , entirely unconscious of 82 . THE SATURDAY the hellish qualities of that deliciously white mud . We were wild girls , but entirely harmless ; our amusements were most innocent , and mama was wise in that . she let us  --  within certain limits , of course ? enjoy ourselves as we would . There Iwas a glorious and blessed freedom about that Malta life , a freedom which had to do with the sunshine and the general good humor of the people , young and happy , and who had no Hintergeda But one can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice was raised in protest against the too great freedom our mother allowed us . How could we be permitted to ride alone on the race course in the company of a dozen young men ? This voice was that of an elder lady of the family , one who , alas , . " saw through a glass darkly . " and who , not being harmless herself , was unable to recognize harmlessness in others , nor did she care what heartburn she caused , Mama disagreed with her point of view , but her voice was too loud to be ignored and mama felt obliged henceforth to send her daughters out in the company of their governess . This was a dreary arrangement for both parties . Mademoiselle could not ride  --  that , at least , was a mercy  --  and the Massa was both shadeless and hot .. Nevertheless , she had to inflict her unwelcome company upon us , bumping backwards and forwards after us to the Massa in a local carriage , and installing herself as best she could under a red cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not the expression of our faces or our conversation . I can not say that these interested her overmuch ; hunched up under her scarlet protection , which , we declared , made our horses shy , she would soon he deeply absorbed in her book , becoming oblivious to all else . We only regretted that she sat too far away for us to be able to splash the offending parasol as we galloped past . But it was against the lady from Englund that we most greatly raged , against that voice so jarringly raised in our Garden of Eden . Schoolroom Trials As may have been observed , our lessons did not weigh heavily in the plan of our lives , though there were certain hours of study which , according to us , disagreeably interrupted our freedom . The first year it was Mademoiselle who was the schoolroom Cerberus , who bad to see to this less pleasant side of life . She herself gave us lessons , but the second year , owing to ill health and a want . of loyalty towards our mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger and of good family , seemingly very charming , but who later played a none too happy part in our lives . She , alas , became too great a Favorite with mama , who , in this case , unfortunately misplaced her trust . But there was a glorious interregnum when the old authority was zit an end and the new one was not yet . installed , and this was a period of bliss which Ducky and I arranged entirely to our convenience . One delightful figure of those sand-room days must he mentioned : Our music mistress , Miss Butler , who came three times it week to give us lessons . Miss Butler , though of English Gilgit : , as her name proves , had with the EVENING POST years almost become a Maltese , and her dress was in accordance with a very southern conception of elegance . Bright colors and plumes played a great part in her attire . She was portly and indulgent , and her very much bebustled Sunday best was a mustard-tinted plush with pink ostrich feathers ; and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was startling , to say the least . Miss Butler was too indulgent and too fond of us to he an efficient instructor to a trio of unruly children not overblessed with musical aptitude . Like a. dear old lady called Mrs. Duget who came to Birk-hall in Scotland to give us music lessons , I think her efforts were crowned with no particularly artistic results , but we kept in touch with both till we were all three married and mothers of a family . Our Music Mistress Dear old Miss Butler ! She was a real friend , even if she did not make a Paderewski or a Rubinstein out of any of us . Ducky and I , as two able-minded elders , entirely overruled sister Sandra , who was seldom allowed a say in any matter , and we so arranged our studies that she was installed at her music during the hours when we two particularly desired to he free . Happy-go-lucky days when the Malta sunshine made all mankind indulgent and we were able , during a blessed interregnum , to arrange our lessons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearest friend and remained so to the end of her life , being one of the few who outlived mama . She was an Irishwoman of the Butler family , and had all the wit and vivacity of her race , also something of their instinctive antagonism to all things too truly British . Without be-Mg a beauty , she was full of charm , very clever , a delightful companion , amusing , gay , well read , and forever on the go , although her health was poor . Men were attracted by her , and she had always an adorer or two sighing at her heels ; they were generally the men we children did net care about  --  the intellectuals , ks beaux parlours , les grund8 manikins ? those who had a touch of cynicism in their make-up . She dressed in an original way , harmoniously in keeping with her marquise type . Her short gray hair was her outstanding originality . Mama often used her as lady in waiting , though she never officially occupied that position . Mademoiselle did not like Lady Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mother , and not a good one at that . She loathed her success , her affectations , her originalities , and these were always expounded to us in the schoolroom in a way which was not at all in keeping with the Christian principles she endeavored to instill into us . She had , in fact , an ugly way of poisoning our minds against mama 's great friend , making her appear in our eyes as a grasping woman sponging upon our mother 's bouuties and misusing her kindness . I am certain that this was a most unfair appreciation of the vivacious , entertaining lady , but Mademoiselle managed to sow a seed of mistrust in our hearts , Lady Mary had a worthy but dull and rather deaf husband who was generally left at home , and three sweet little daughters ; Mab , Elsie and Enaone for each of us sisters , and almost exactly our age . Saturday was the picnic day , and great riding parties were organized to January 6 , 1954 some distant corner of the island : St. Paul 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other places the names of which I have , alas , forgotten . Mania would follow in a carriage with one or another of her friends . The start for these picnics was exciting to a degree , and full of clatter and noise . Our horses were fresh , prancing , ready to be off , difficult to hold . We , in our fearlessness , which amounted to unconsciousness : of any cause for fear , enjoyed their pranks , which would have horrified old Lumley and all orthodox riders , and our first gallop , which was always down the walled-in avenue by the courtyard , was a most unruly proceeding . We were more like is troop of swooping Red Indians than civilized little girls . Our horses , being stallions , were all too ready with their teeth , an.d would often get a good grip of each other 's tails , and thus , one behind the other , we would dash down that . hard avenue , shrieking with laughter , our naval friends pounding after us whilst our horses were doing their best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unruly as ours , although most of them rode with more science and decorum . We never realized that ours was a rather wild way of riding . We just let our spirits get the better of us , our companions encouraging our foolhardiness , but , luckily , there is a god who looks after the innocent . The Horse Marines of Malta Amongst our group of very young naval friends there was a certain Lieutenant Allenby , a round-faced youth , all smiles , good humor and recklessness . Though his years counted more than ours , he was not a day older than we as to tastes and habits ; there was plenty of health in him , but little wisdom . When Allenby was one of the party , it was sure to be a day of adventure , frolic and merrymaking , a day , also , of anxiety for the elders . lie was allowed in small doses only , because our association was not de lout repos . We called Allenby , Full Moon , because of , Anson , Streattleld , Eric Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time midshipmen on the Alexandra . Beatty was my special friend and was already in those clays a splendid rider and good polo player . He has said since that I brought him luck . Colin Keppel was our father 's flag lieutenant . He was as wax in our hands , but was considered a safe companion and we were mostly intrusted to his cure . He was as faithful as a dog , and we entirely approved of him . Colville was always full of fun , but a little supercilious . The most serious and steady was Anson  --  too serious , in fact , so that he was dubbed " Old Anson , " with a touch of pity in the epithet . The rides with Old Anson were just the opposite of those taken in Allenby 's company and were considered somewhat in the light of correction . But the greatest of all our friends  --  so to say , our hero  --  was Maurice Bourke , at that time commander of our father 's yacht , H. M. S. Surprise . How we loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideal of three little girls with high spirits and a desire for hero worship . A broad-minded , warm-hearted , genial gentleman was Maurice Bourke , with a humorous way of seeing the good in his neighbor and of excusing the had . Generous , amusing , he allowed each man his due , and knew how to plead for a culprit ; besides , who could resist that crooked , white-toothed smile of his ? For us , Captain Bourke had extraordinary prestige , he was able to arouse in us complete and undiscussed allegiance . I , for one , to quote a poet 's undying words , loved him with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhood 's faith . " We would have gone through fire and water for him . He could make us listen , obey and submit as no one else . His word was magic . All revolts could be appeased by Captain Bourke ; be could make us yield to any rule and accept even those things we most violently opposed . I remember a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we had revolted against our skirts being lengthened . We smelt danger , a trap ! We did not want to grow up , life was too exquisite as it was , we feared any change , anything that might curtail our glorious liberty and independence . We had a subconscious knowledge that there could be no going back . Lengthening skirts was a sign of certain restrictions to our wild ways , it had something to do with the clipping of wings and the putting on of chains , and we were prepared to oppose this innovation with all the strength of our wills , which could become steel when rebellion rose within us . Mama 's - ambassador Mama , who was at her wits ' end , sent our beloved captain to bring us to reason . This was indeed a wily move ; no deputy could have been better chosen . I can not remember what argument Maurice Bourke used , or in what way he beguiled us to submission , but he did carry the day , and from then onwards we wore our dresses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our limbs . Each time there was rebellion in the air , Maurice Bourke was the one deputed to talk reason to us , and such was our love for him that he could obtain from us the most difficult concessions . Whenever he was away , Captain Bourke would write long and amusing letters , which we faithfully answered , and in this way a very regular correspondence was kept up  --  a correspondence which did not cease till his death many years later , but . much too early for those who loved him . H. M. S. Surprise was the yacht at the disposal of the commander in chief . My mother often followed the cruises my father made with his fleet .. Thus she saw many interesting places . I have chosen a letter in which she describes a visit to Montenegro . She was an excellent letter writer , and I am sure that this picture of those regions which have now changed hands will be interesting to anyone who reads it . All this , as can be seen by the date on the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , M oNTFINEcft 0 " October 3rd , 1887 . " My Darlings. - Here we are in Montenegro , and this curious country is so unlike anything else that I think myself in a dream . But I must tell you what we did after Zara . The night before we left that place , we had a ball at the governor 's . I did not dance , as I knew nobody , but had to talk to some ladies who only spoke Italian . We left after an endless supper and nest day started very early for Spalato and separated from the squadron , which came on straight to Cattaro . We had the idea of stopping at another pretty place before Spalato , culled Trau , and spent the night at anchor there . We saw a very interesting and fine old church there and a most curious small town . In the evening came a frightful thunderstorm , to which we are getting quite accustomed , though they make a terrific row . " Now Mrs. Monson reads to Captain Bourke and myself when we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the scrap book of our cruises . It is getting quite interesting and Captain Bourke does it beautifully . Photographs , menus , invitations , newspapers , sketches , all goes in , and our kind captain is so pleased to have this occupation in his free hours . He is a wonderfully practical and kind man , thinks of everything and makes our life very comfortable and pleasant . At Spoleto we saw the most interesting remains of Diocletian 's palace , into the middle of which is built the town . The cathedral is an ancient Roman temple . " In the afternoon we went to see the remains of the old town of Salona which are just being excavated , but it . began to pour with rain and before we got home we were almost drenched . When we had to cross from the shore to the ship , there was such a downpour that we could hardly distinguish the Surprise and got on board at last . all dripping . The weather being so bad , we decided to start only next morning . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel the whole time between the islands , we did not feel it and anchored again at night in a small bay , to arrive at Cattaro next morning and not in the dark . I got up before six , to be ready before we began to toss about , and we had a few nasty hours before we got in to the wonderful Bay of Cattaro . It is exactly like a big lake surrounded by immense mountains . We took an hour and a half before we reached the end of it where the small town of Cattaro is situated . We found there the whole squadron . Next day , Saturday , we went to a picnic given by the officers of the Alexandra on the shore , in a small hay . It was great run ; they had all sorts of games , races , jumping through the water , and got all very hot and dirty . Some even played various instruments and were like a lot of children . " Yesterday morning we started from Cattaro at . eight . and had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw such a splendid view and such a magnificent road . George went with us , and we had , besides , Mrs. Monson , Captain Bourke and Mr. Keppel . Unfortunately , we got into a mist and could not see the marvelous view film the very top . At the Montenegro frontier the Prince met us , and we were very pleased to see him , as he is a very old friend and such an amiable man . He had prepared a luncheon in a small house belonging to him and we were very hungry after the long drive . The Prince himself and every man in the country wears the beautiful national dress . They are such handsome men , even the common peasants , and so very friendly and respectful . " But curious enough it seems to us hardly ever to meet a woman in the streets . They are very modest and stay at home , but the men walk about , and in the evening dance a very curious war dance , much wilder than the Scotch reel . They sing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stillness of the night . Before we reached the town of Cettinie we were met by the Prince 's eldest son , a very pretty boy aged sixteen , very tall and dark , with most excellent manners and such a bright , clever look . He was on horseback at the head of a cavalry escort , all mounted on very small , strong ponies . : - " On the Tuesday we went on an expedition to the lake of Seutary , and it was lovely scenery . We first went by road , then down a river in a small steamer and into the lake , with grand mountain scenery . The Prince is building a small house on a peninsula , and we had to land on the rocks and go up a steep hill , which I did not like much in the heat , but the good people pull one up with such energy that one has to get on without stopping . We had lunch out-of-doors . On the way back , the Prince killed a very poisonous snake that was going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for luncheon with the Prince and his son , and they visited most of the ships ; then papa gave a big dinner on the Alexandra and they left this morning . " I was so pleased to get news twice from you here . I hope Sandra has been to the dentist .. as she ought soon to take off her plate . Arrange a nice birthday for Alfred . But how sad to be far away on mine ! I send you all many kisses , " Your old " I am so pleased Mademoiselle liked her presents . " The Loss of H. M. S. Victoria In his uniquely humorous way , Captain Bourke would also paint his future portrait as that of an old red- ' faced admiral with thick , curly white hair and jovial smile . He never lived to become an admiral , alas , and the latter part of his career was darkened by a terrible naval disaster , the loss of H. M. S. Victoria . Well do I remember receiving the news of that disaster , a few months after my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment in a foreign country . My mother telegraphed the loss of the Victoria , but that Maurice Bourke , thank God , was amongst . the saved . The shock was terrible , but I remember my tears of gratitude because nothing had happened to " Captain dear , " use we called our great friend . There was also another great friend in those Malta days of innocence , and that was Cousin George . Cousin George , though ten years older than I , was also very young in those days and not a bit too grand and grown up to be happy in our company . I do not think he was even called the Duke of York then , but simply Prince George . He was also in H. M. S. Alexandra , under my father 's command . Both my parents were very fond of him , and there was always a room ready for him at San Antonio when he was not on service . Cousin George was a beloved chum . He , too , was able to keep the unruly trio in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I proudly remember that in the case of Cousin George I was a decided favorite ; there was no doubt about that whatever . What fun we had with George ; what delightful , harmless fun ! He used to drive us in a high , two-wheeled dogcart ; the horse he drove was called Coekey , a steady brown cob . One of us sat beside him and the other two at the hack . Those at the hack were generally kneeling on 8.1 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 6 , 1934 the seat and chattering for all they were worth with the two in front . There were also glorious rides with Cousin George , who had a horse called Real Jam , a beautiful , glossy bay . In Malta , everybody was interested in his neighbor 's horse ; they so belonged to the life there that . they were like part of the family . Real Jam was a perfect creature and was taken back to Sandringham by his master when the Malta days came to a close . Whenever he could , Cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of declaring that " the dear three " were much better behaved and less unruly when he was leader of the wild horde . It was certainly Allenby , or Full Moon , who was the most irrepressible . The days when he was one of the party were days of high jinks . I have found old letters from George ex-pressing a hope " that Allenby has been behaving himself " ; George preferred being first in command on the days when rowdy Allenby was not one of the party . But . neither Cousin George nor boisterous Allenby was at a certain picnic to which a sadly humiliating remembrance is attached . R Teatime Revolution We had ridden to some far-off part of the island , and there mama , Lady Mary and her daughters had joined us by carriage for tea , It was a beautiful sunny day and we were a cheerful party , mama very proud of a new bay she had discovered on the farther side of the island . Mama loved voyages of discover ? . The last hit of the road down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it had been considered risky to follow such a precipitous path on horseback . On the way up again , mama proposed that Lady Mary , who was delicate and easily tired , should , so as not to fatigue herself , ride up the steepest part of the climb on Tommy 's hack . Tommy was a sturdy little beast and well up to the weight of one as frail as Lady Mary , but Mademoiselle 's insinuations against mama 's friend had made their mark and lay festering in our minds . Mama 's quite innocent proposal suddenly made our resent , ment against her burst into flame . Our horses were sacred to us ; we were idiotically jealous about them and no one was ever allowed to get on to them except ourselves or the groom ; so we noisily proclaimed that " poor " Tommy could not . possibly carry a grown-up person on his back . Mama , ashamed of her ungracious little girls , swept . our objections aside and quite rightly insisted upon the very much perturbed Lady Mary getting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A disgraceful scene followed . Entirely carried away by our rage , whilst climbing the hill behind mama , Tommy and his burden , we vituperated against Lady Mary to her daughters , who were walking beside us , and goodness knows what unforgivable things we said to our three little friends about their mother . All Mademoiselle 's unfounded accusations against Lady Mary came , all unconsciously , from our lips . When the top of the hill was reached , Lady Mary got off and Tommy was given over again to his rightful mistress , and we all three remounted . Mama , to mark her pained disapproval of her offending children , drove off without a word and without even casting a look behind her . This was as fuel to the flame of our wrath . In floods of tears , like three God-forsaken Little savages , giving rein to our horses , we dashed full gallop after the carriage , roaring with rage and sticking our tongues out as far as they would go , whilst we hurled at Lady Mary 's head all the ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No doubt there was also a comic side to this most reprehensible scene . It , must have been a fine sight to see three ill-behaved little Amazons tearing full tilt along the high road behind that well-turned-out , sedate-looking pony earl in which sat two ladies who could only save their dignity by pretending to ignore that they were being pursued by a trio of weeping little furies with their tongues stuck out . Many years later we found an old letter addressed to our brother in which Ducky had made a sketch of this scene . There may be , at certain moments in life , a hitter satisfaction in letting your temper get the better of you , in reveling in your wrath , but the " afterwards " is all sorrow and mortification , Restored to your senses , you see how pitiful and futile was your outhurst , and the exultation of your fury gives place to shame and humiliation . All this and more was experienced when we reached home about half an hour after mama . Lady Mary had retired to her own apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her room stood mama , like the angel with the flaming sword . Oh , terrible moment of retribution when , with hanging heads , red noses and swollen eyes , we stood facing her righteous indignation . As can well he imagined , she did not spare us She said we were to ask God to forgive us , because she could not , that she was ashamed of having to call us her children , and other equally hard things that penetrated to the very marrow of our bones . Punishment to Fit the Crime We all three finally collapsed on some small stairs leading from mama 's boudoir to her dressing room , a dark little corner where our humiliation was hidden in shadow . There we lay , three little heaps of misery , faces turned towards the dusty carpet , which was quite in keeping with our abasement , crushed by the enormity of our sin , overcome by mama 's bitter reproof , feeling that we deserved every word of her upbraiding . But words were not sufficient chastisement . Our outraged parent hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banished for a whole long week from the royal stables , and to our public shame were conducted to the Ditch , which was the name of the big stables where all our naval friends kept their horses . It was called the Ditch because it was built in the large moat encircling Valetta . This was a cruelly well chosen penalty , as it was a way of letting all our riding companions know that we were in disgrace . Cousin George was very kind on this occasion . He was truly sorry for " the dear three " ; though , of course , he could not approve of what . we had done . But even today I can feel what a delicious relief it was to lay my humiliated head upon his shoulder and to weep my heart out , my face bidden in the mass of my " yellow " hair . I believe that Cousin George 's handkerchief was also very welcome on this occasion , because does one ever at such tragic moments find one 's own ? " Poor dear little Missy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and Missy learned at that hour how very sweet the big , grown-up cousin could be !
