txt Ever since the war there has been endless talk about getting European nations to lower their tariff barriers . Public men have urged that something be done . Economists have begged for action . Committees and international conferences have met and conferred and resolved about it , but nothing has been done . Suddenly Germany and Austria have decided that the way to do it is to make a definite beginning . Instead of taking a brick here and there off the tariff wall between their two countries , they have resolved to raze the whole structure . Hereafter trade between them is to be absolutely unrestricted . Some details remain to be worked out , and certain duties on special classes of goods are to be retained for a brief period , but in general complete freedom of - trade between Austria and Germany has been agreed upon . Nor is this Zonverein to be necessarily exclusive . Other nations are to be permitted and invited to join it if they will .

In laboring toward that goal , Foreign ? Minister BRIAND , the protagonist of the movement , has been inclined to put political considerations before economic . There must be treaties and agreements , he argued , defining the political status , before there could be practical , financial arrangements . But here we have the first practical step purely economic . While the rest of Europe ? and we may say the United States also  --  was fumbling the whole tariff question , and getting nowhere with it , the German and Austrian Governments boldly cut the knot as between themselves . Naturally , the announcement has caused surprise , and perhaps a little misgiving in certain countries . They remember how the old Zol/verein between the separate German States was one of the preliminaries to the formation of the German Empire . In the present instance , they profess a fear that this first step of a customs union between Austria and Germany may be followed by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow . In fact , it could not follow at all without a modification of the Versailles Treaty , or the consent of the Council of the League of Nations . Nothing of that kind can be immediately expected . And the very " independence of Austria " which is stipulated and safeguarded by the Versailles Treaty , implies that she has a full and unquestionable right to make such a trade agreement as she has now entered into with Germany . Thus while other nations have been waiting and debating , ' Germany and Austria have acted : It is a bold step which they have taken , but there can be no doubt that it will prove a wise one , have stupidly erected . In view of thisAusfro-German agreement , fresh force : is given to the " Plea for the " Removal of Restrictions Upon Eu " ropean Trade " issued five years mg INA ? Ataned- ** American financiers . They might well now turn their eyes to the Washington Government and say to it : " Go thou and do likewise . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
