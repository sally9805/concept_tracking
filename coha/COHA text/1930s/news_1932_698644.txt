txt The Board of Estimate voted unanimous approval yesterday of the form of contract for independent operation of the new city subway system , as recently submitted and revised by the Board of Transportation , and authorized that body to advertise for operating proposals . The advertising will be started Immediately and a month will be given for the receipt of bids . The public hearing that preceded the authorization developed little opposition to ' he form of contract , but did elicit objections to the principle of private operation from groups that urged municipal operation as a preferable policy . The hearing evoked also the first open criticism before the Board of Estimate of alleged unwarranted delay in beginning operation of the new Eighth Avenue line . This came chiefly from James W. Danahy , spokesman for the West Side Association of Commerce , who declared that the Board of Transportation should prepare and submit at once a plan for municipal operation , to be put in effect in the event that no operating proposals were received for the form of contract recommended . In reply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was explained by John H. Delaney , chairman of the Board of Transportation , that approval of the contract form and authorization to advertise for proposals did not commit the Board of Estimate to final action . The proposals , when received , will be analyzed and compared by the Board of Transportation , whose report and recommendations to the Board of Estimate will form the basis for that body 's authorization of an operating award . Provisions of the Contract . As approved by the Board of Estimate the contract calls for private operation of the new city lines , beginning with the Eighth Avenue line and expanding as additional links are ready for operation . The operator is required to show cash capital of at least $750,000 and to carry adequate spare parts and supplies , as well as post a $500,000 continuing bond . Its compensation will be in the form of an annual allowance , if earned , for various periods of the ten-year term of the contract . This allowance , available from gross revenues at a five-cent fare , is to be named by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement provided for at least a 6 per cent annual return to the operator on its $750.000 investment and its inventory , but this minimum sum was neither guaranteed nor made a preferential payment . It was , however , made cumulative , so that if not earned in any given year it could be paid , if earned , in a subsequent year . Criticism of the Board of Transportation for failure to get the Eighth Avenue subway in operation before now was voiced at the outset of the hearing by Cornelius M. Sheehan , a former city official and a familiar figure at hearings dealing with transportation matters . Mayor Walker 's efforts to divert him from this subject , on the ground it bore no relationship to the form of contract up for consideration , drew from Mr. Sheehan the retort that the contract was but a step in a series of events related to unwarranted delay in the I handling of the entire new subway Iprogram . Mr. Sheehan urged municipal operation instead of operation under a contract and lease . The issue of early operation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fore when the next speaker , Mr. Danahy , urged approval of the operating contract , but asked ; ' that immediate steps be taken to prepare and present a plan of municipal operation so that the new line might be put into early service even if the ; contract now favored by the Board I of Transportation failed to elicit an acceptable bid from any operating 1 company or management corporation , Says City 's Rights Are Protected . The West Side Association of Commerce , Mr. Danahy declared , did not approve the proposed private operating contract in its entirely , but did believe that " there never was a contract protecting the rights of the city as much as this one does . " Under its terms , he declared , it would not be possible to have any repetition of the injustices inflicted upon the city under the existing dual contracts . " The directors of the West Side Association of Commerce , " he declared , " are doubtful if any legitimate bids will be offered on this contract and would like to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation by the Board of 1 Transportation . cannot he prepared 1 at once , to be available if no acceptable bids are received . " Turning to Mr. Delaney , who occupied a seat in the front of the Board of Estimate chamber , Mr. Danahy asked whether the Board of Trans ' . portation had any alternative plan in ; mind . I " I have no reply to make to Mr. Danahy as to what I am going to do tomorrow , " Mr. Delaney declared . " I am here advocating what I believe should be done today . " " That has been Mr. Delaney 's attitude right along , in response to our inquiries , " Mr. Danahy replied . " Peri naps that accounts for the delay in I opening the new Eighth Avenue line . " Mayor Walker took a hand at this point and declared his belief that Mr. Delaney , as well as other busy public officials , should not be called upon to make public their future plans on any and all occasions . The Board of Transportation , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , declared that it was prepared to operate the new city lines directly if necessary and was preparing estimates on that basis , which it would later submit to the Board of Estimate . Thomas Asks Municipal Operation . Municipal operation of the new city lines was urged by Norman Thomas , Socialist leader , who declared that the private operation contract presented by the Board of Transportation , although undoubtedly safeguarding the city 's interests , had ignored entirely the rights of the workers . " Not a single clause Is introduced for the protection of labor , " he said . " No effort is made to impose minimum wages or working conditions upon the operator who bids for the contract . " Conceding that operation under the proposed contract might be , as urged in the Board of Transportation report , less expensive than municipal operation , the saving , according to Mr. Thomas , would be almost entirely at the expense of labor , which , presumably , would be employed by the contractor under practically the same conditions which exist on the B.-M . T. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers sufficiently expert to plan and construct the new subway lines it should be able to operate them efficiently , if politics were barred , Mr. Thomas declared . A plea for inclusion in the contract of provisions guaranteeing labor 's right of collective bargaining was made by James C. Quinn . secretary of the Central Trades and Labor Council . Paul Blanshard , executive director of the City Affairs Committee , was another who advocated municipal operation and the proper protection of subway workers as to hours and wages . He too conceded that the proposed contract was drawn with due regard to the city 's interest . He voiced approval of Mr. Delaney 's four-year bond policy of financing new subway construction and declared that the committee favored the five-cent fare and believed that short-term financing was its safeguard . Municipal operation , however , was in his opinion a preferable policy . Draws Walker 's Censure . Mr. Blanshard provoked Mayor Walker 's censure when he declared that Mr. Danahy had a right to ask what the Board of Transportation intended to do if no bids were received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answer . " Mr. Delaney has a right not to be cross-examined by every one and any one on all occasions , " the Mayor declared . " The representatives of responsible civic groups know that the fault for any delay in operation is not in this room . " Throughout the hearing there was virtually no discussion by spokesmen for civic groups of the various speIcific provisions of the proposed con ; tract , nor were any of the better i known civic groups , with the except tion of the West Side Association of ICommerce , represented at the hearing , although the contract provides for the operation of the entire city subway system now nearing completion . Mr. Delaney opened the hearing with a brief r  --  sum ? of the salient features of the contract . John J. Collins , special counsel for the Board of Transportation , who was present to explain the proposed contract , was not called upon by either the members of the Board of Estimate or the representatives of various civic organizations represented at the hearing .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
