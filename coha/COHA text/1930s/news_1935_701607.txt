New York City , which has published since last September a racing paper known as The Daily Racing Post . The charges against the two men revolve around tipster service advertisements in their publication . According to officials of the Attorney General 's Anti-Racket Bureau , services of this type , which say they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting as much as $3,000,000 a year from race track followers throughout the country . There are said to be 100 of these services operating out of New York City . More Than 1,500 Examined . Activities of such services have been under investigation for the past nine months by the Attorney General 's office in cooperation with the postal authorities . More than 1,500 persons have been examined and in the past several weeks about fifty persons have been called before the grand jury here by Assistant Attorney General Sharon J. Mauhs and District Attorney John B. Smith . Among those called were officials of the State Racing Commission and of the Saratoga Racing Association . These officials denied the assertions of tipsters that they could " fix " races . John Sloan , member of the Racing Commission , charged that gangsters frequented the Saratoga track , but this was denied by George R. Bull , president of the racing association . Mr. Mauhs said that the investigation was completed so far as the Saratoga grand jury was concerned and indicated that it would now be extended to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next scene of activity , since the grand jury there is being held and already has spent one day in hearing evidence . Eventually , it is expected , the Federal authorities will use the evidence collected by the Attorney General to prosecute for fraudulent use of the mails , and Attorney Generals in other States are expected to assist in suppressing the racket . At the arraignment of the first two defendants today Mr. Mauhs said that there were five other indictments against them . He asked that the bail be high because he believed that they " have it in mind to forfeit bail . " He indicated that he knew where to locate many of the others named in the indictments , although some are believed to have left the State The charges against the defendants are misdemeanors punishable by a year in jail and a $500 fine . Bennett Predicts Racket End . Attorney General John J. Bennett Jr. , in comment here last night on the indictments in Saratoga County , said that he was very well pleased with the work of his AntiRacket Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities and officials of other States , " one of the biggest swindles in the country " eventually would be driven out of existence . Thomas F. Ward Jr. , chief investigator of the Attorney General 's Anti-Racket Bureau , made public here a statement describing how the racetrack tipster racket operates . According to the investigation of Mr. Ward and his assistants , Harry Sievers and Thomas F. Vogt , the first step in launching a fraudulent tipster service . is an advertising campaign in - the racing papers . This is known as " dynamiting . " Readers are urged to subscribe immediately to the " service , " the tipster claiming ? that he has been . putting over a daily winning " parlay " at long odds . ( A " parlay " is a combination bet , usually on two horses , whereby all the winnings from the first horse are placed on the second . Both horses have to win for the parlay to be successful . ) The advertisements always mention a winning parlay declared to have been put over on the previous day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sucker list , " which in one case comprised 18,000 names sent in from all parts of the country . He notifies his subscribers that service will begin at once . Telegrams Sent Collect . Telegrams are sent collect to the I subscribers , giving them the name of a two-horse parlay . Invariably the parlay fails to win , but when the subscriber turns to the next day 's advertisement he finds that the service claims that it has sold a different combination that did win . If he complains he is told that the information came in at the last minute or receives some other excuse . After several weeks the list becomes known as a " hot list , " and the tipster folds up and starts a new service under another name . Fees by these " services " range from $5 to $100 for -a six-day period . " If the subscriber complains to the publisher handling this type of fraudulent advertising , he receives vague excuses , but no satisfaction , " the statement issued by Mr. Ward said . " The tipster is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily columns of the paper , even though the advertising managers have in their possession hundreds of complaints against these tipsters . " When the victim visits the office of the tipster service to complain he is given another ' phony ' excuse and if he persists and demands the return of his money they call one of their strong arm men from another room and he is told what will happen to him if he makes a ' squawk . ' " Some of these tipsters use the United States mails to send out a glowing prospectus to their sucker list . In one particular case there were sixteen thousand letters mailed to prospective victims in which the tipster stated that he was from the ' gold coast ' of Chicago and was connected with one of the ' swankiest ' stables in America and that he had been barred by the Chicago Board of Pool Room Proprietors because he had put over seventeen winning horses out of twenty-ones , " He further stated that he controlled at one of the well-known Eastern tracks thirty-one different stables and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over by jockeys in his employ . The horse he gave his subscribers as a sure thing finished , fifth in a field of six . " Another phase of the tipster racket is the " special , " according to Mr. Ward . Subscribers are told that a " special " is being fixed up and that they can get in if they have the money . The price asked ranges from $50 to $500 , the tipster ' stating that he has gone to considerable expense ' in fixing the race . However , if the subscriber balks , he can generally- get the special for as little as $5 . Some services also accept bets , Mr. Ward said , particularly from out-oftown customers , and usually they are so sure the horse they name is going to lose that they do not place the bets . A variant of the system is known as the " three-day blasting method . " This involves honest advertising at first to win the confidence of readers . Another system , is the " subscriber betting method , " in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipster . Subscribers are divided into groups . Each group receives a different horse in the same race . The bets cover all the horses in the race and the tipster is bound to win . If the customer fails to remit the winnings immediately , he is visited by strong-arm men who threaten him with a beating unless he pays up . So brazen do some operators become , the investigator said , that they even advertise as a winner a horse that actually lost the previous day . They assert that they post their daily choiees with an official of the paper before sending them to subscribers , but get around this by posting the names of all horses in every race . Mr. Ward said that his investigations showed that some of the racing papers were in league with the tipsters and received a large part of the " take . " He said that one of the smaller operators admitted paying a paper $4,500 in one month . Victims of the racket , he said , included lawyers , doctors , engineers , policemen , housewives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life savings of $1,600 and placed them on a parlay.
