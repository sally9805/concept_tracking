Playing baccarat at the big table in Deauville in 1929 , the flashy little Jew whom everyone calls the Ford of France tossed a 10,000 franc ( then $400 ) chip over his shoulder with the contemptuous remark " Be so kind , Madame , as to take this and stop breathing down the back of my neck . " <P> Today M. Andr Citron no longer has francs to fling . For some years now the flashy little maker of Citron cars , with a lack of originality he once would have scorned , has been leasing the new features pioneered by Walter P. Chrysler . Chrysler " floating power " became in France " le moteur flottant " of Citron . It helped , but not enough . This year , slipping perilously near to bankruptcy , M. Citron struck out with a new car of his own which has made Paris sit up and stare . It has front wheel drive , " knee action " on all four wheels and lines phenomenally low and streamy . <P> Instantly a smash hit , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets of Paris . But , even so , it has not yet managed to pull M. Citron out of his deep , dark red . Last week , pale and determined , the Ford of France faced his bankers . They were tired of carrying him , with extension after extension ( TIME , March 12 ) . They wanted to foreclose . With a frantic gleam in his dark eyes Andr Citron shrilled " Messieurs , on the day I am deprived of control over the business I have built up I shall commit suicide ! " <P> With France in the grip of acute Deflation , neither her bankers nor the Government want another spectacular suicide . Last week was a good time for a smart Frenchman like Andr Citron to sell his life dearly . Having hurled his ultimatum he sat back and did not have to wait long . <P> Michelin , the historic French firm of pneumatic tire pioneers , is one of Citron 's largest creditors . With some 30,000,000 francs ( $2,000,000 ) at stake , Michelin decided last week to gamble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another three months the Ford of France will be able to get on his feet . For that period Michelin agreed to guarantee the debts of Citron , but on a hard condition . To make sure that the slick motorman plays no tricks , Michelin forced M. Citron to admit into his plants Michelin technicians and Michelin accountants who will keep tab on every move , every franc , every centime .
