txt The American People 's Theatre . Having attended classes at the American People 's Theatre , I feel the time appropriate for all interested persons to petition the proper authorities for the continuance of this splendid activity . The American People 's Theatre was established about a year ago . The use of an old school building at 257 West Fortieth Street was obtained . as were the services of a staff of teachers who were paid by CWA relief funds . After about six months a group of instructors complained to Gilbert Weaver . CWA official , about the " incompetent way the place was being run . " Mr. Weaver informed the instructors that something would be done before Oct. 18 , if they followed his advice . To date the only result is that the theatre has been closed and most of the staff transferred to scattered projects . JACK DRASNER . Brooklyn . Oct. 29 , 1934.
