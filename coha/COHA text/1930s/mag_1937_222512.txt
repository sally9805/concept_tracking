" The labor question ... is the outstanding problem in today 's industrial life " declared Bethlehem Steel 's Eugene Grace in a farewell address to the members of the American Iron &; Steel Institute in Manhattan last week . To the nation 's steelmasters , gathered in record numbers against a backdrop of the biggest steel strike since 1919 ( see p. 13 ) ; the outstanding and directly related question was Mr. Grace 's successor as head of the Steel Institute . The settlement by which Myron Taylor had made his peace with John L. Lewis had split the industry as it had never been split before . Outmaneuvered by Mr. Taylor , outsmarted by Mr Lewis the big independent steelmakers were fired with a wrath born of isolation . Big Steel and the little fellows had later yielded recognition to the C.I . O. For the first time since the schism was opened ast spring when U.S. Steel 's President William Adolf Irvin telephoned his competitors the incredible news , the two factions sat down in the same room . <P> Outwardly all was harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the choice of a new leader of the Institute soon narrowed down to Big Steel 's Irvin as a representative of the new order and those two hard-bitten foes of organized labor , Republic Steel 's Tom Mercer Girdler and National Steel 's Ernest Tener Weir . For three hours the Institute s directors battled in a secret session frequently punctuated by heat-treated speeches from Mr. Grace . On emerging . the directors blandly announced the unanimous election of Steelman Girdler , whose Chicago plant was within a few hours to be steel 's bloody ground for the week . One of the two vice-presidencies went to Mr. Irvin , the other to Mr. Weir , who later greeted the banqueting steelmen with a perfect Fascist salute . It was a sweet , though probably hollow , victory for the embattled independents , for it meant that the Institute still stood for a last-ditch fight for the Open Shop .
