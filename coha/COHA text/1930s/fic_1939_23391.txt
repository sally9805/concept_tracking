AT THE SPA A STORY BY MARJORIE WORTHINGTON TToutsunshine this afternoon brought out nearly everybody who had come to Vichy for the cure . Round the counter under the pavilion stout French girls , in what looked like boudoir caps , dispensed the water in large punch glasses . In the crowd that gathered there were the usual middle-aged rentiers , in neat black suits and broad-brimmed black felt hats , with their heavy watch-chains , symbols of their respectability . And there were the elderly ladies in bucketlike hats with veils attached , dressed in layers of silk jackets , propping their handbags and their knitting bags and their black parasols against the counter , while with tight wrinkled lips they sipped the water . Angela Throop watched them until she grew bored . She had hoped that the crowd at Vichy would be smarter than at Aix-les-Bains , but it was almost the same . She glanced at her husband , who was sitting across from her at the round iron table . She did n't really think these cures did him any good . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hours spent like this , sitting in the sunshine , his skin was gray , not healthy and weatherbeaten like that of the Frenchmen of his age . She felt very sorry for him but just the same , as she crossed one slim leg over the other and picked up her knitting , her sigh was one of impatience . They were registered at the Grand Hotel de l'Europe as Mr. and Mrs. Martin R. Throop , from Boston , Massa-chusetts . He was about fifty years old or so , and she was perhaps thirty , though at a quick glance she seemed much younger than that . She was a thin little blonde with a small oval face and large , opaque blue eyes . She wore her hair in a long bob that reached the shoulders of her pink linen suit . He looked the prosperous , wellborn American that he was , but she might have been almost anything , show girl , post-debutante , or small-town belle . She was a type that grows like the daisies in smalltown America . When she graduated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been voted the prettiest girl in her class . She had had the pick of the town boys , but as she watched her friends marry and settle down to do their own housework , Angela had waited for something better . It had come at last , in the person of a wealthy Bostonian nearly twice her age . Sometimes now , when she was bored or restless , she would remember the triumph of that sailing away to Europe , leaving her friends behind on the pier . She had felt them envying her . It was sweet to remember that now . She glanced at her husband absorbed in a little French book , too small for his large hands . He was peering down at the fine print through his thick-lensed glasses . She felt sorry for Martin . He was not naturally a man who would spend hours reading . In his youth he had loved to sail boats ; he had told her about that . She was fond of Martin , and though she had never been sick a day in her life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin , " she said at last , " we 've been here nearly a week now . I do n't think this cure is doing you much good , do you ? " Her husband raised his head and looked at her . " I do n't know , " he said heavily . Then he added , " I suppose it 's very dull for you , Angela . " " Oh , no , " she said quickly . " I was n't thinking of myself but of you . " " You are very kind , " he said . " You are a good child , Angela . " He waited politely to see if she had more to say , then he went back to his reading . Of course , she told herself , it was n't all like this , sitting in the sun , taking a cure . There had been weeks in Paris and London , where Martin had many connections , and she had been introduced to fascinating people . She had lots of money to spend shopping , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and theaters now and then , and expensive restaurants . In her letters home she loved to mention the names of important people she had met : the Countess This and Lady That . Last year there had been a few weeks at St. Moritz , to reward her for a tedious month at some German spa , and there had been a whole month at Cannes in the south , where she had gone about half-naked most of the day , sunning herself and getting brown . She was remembering that month when she saw the two stout American women seat themselves at the next table . One of them , the stouter of the two , with crimped hair and a neat blue straw hat , might have been her own Aunt Sarah , president of the Ladies ' Aid back in Fairfield . Angie smiled . " Martin , " she said in a voice that was Ioud and clear and meant to carry , " why do n't we run down to Antibes for a while ? Lady Benzingham has taken a house for the season and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would you really like to do that ? " Martin asked slowly . " I guess youwould , would n't you , Angela ? I remember Lady Benzingham . She seemed to take a fancy to you . Interesting woman . " " Oh , yes , " Angie said , with a toss of her long bob , " we are very fond of each other . And she 's a wonderful hostess everyone says . I think it would be lots of fun . " She was using her sophisticated voice now , the one with the slow drawl that she had been practicing . It had been hard to correct the nasal tones she used to have . Martin wanted her to be sophisticated , and she had tried to please him . He was proud that Lady Benzingham liked her , as she said . He wanted her to be popular , to be well liked . After every party he would listen while she told him the nice things that had been said to her . She knew that he wrote home to his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told her what a success his young wife had had in European society . " I think Prince Bertyl will be there ; at Antibes I mean . I read in the paper that he was at a party there . " " Prince Bertyl ? " Martin asked heavily . " I do n't seem to recall . . . " " Oh , yes you do , " Angie said impatiently , " the one who skied so divinely at St. Moritz last winter . Remember , we were watching him and I said he was like a god  --  a god with wings ! " Angie 's cheeks were flushed now . She seemed so eager that he remember . So Martin said with a vague smile , " Ah , yes . . Prince Bertyl ! " " He promised to teach me to ski if we came again , " Angie said , still excited . She could see the two American women out of the corner of her eye . They were listening , the way strangers do in a public park . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Angie continued . " I do n't think I ever told you , Martin , of what happened one night  --  there , in St. Moritz . . " She was gazing now into space , into the sunshine , dotted with people going or coming from the pavilion . " Well , " she went on , with a deep sigh , " you were dressing , and I was ready for dinner before you , so I went down and I walked out on the verandah of the clubhouse to Took at the sunset on the snow . Suddenly I knew there was another person on the verandah . It was he , Prince Bertyl , whom we had been admiring that afternoon . He came close to me and he said , ' Your name is Angela . It is a perfect name for you . ' I did n't know what to say to that . I guess I answered something or other . Then the next thing I knew he had taken my hand and was kissing it I tried to pull away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call mystical . . . . I feel that we are to meet again , and that we are to mean a great deal to each other . ' " She had let her voice drop to a whisper , a very clear whisper , like that of actresses on the stage , who are talking only to the audience and themselves . She kept staring into the sunshine for a few minutcs , then she laughed lightly and turned to her husband . " So you see , " she said " I do n't really think I should pursue him , do you ? " Martin 's head had dropped again over his book . He looked up now with a start . " Eh ? " he said , with that old man 's habit . " Eh ? No , I guess not . Listen to this that I have just been reading , Angie . It is by Victor Hugo , written in 1847 , about a spa like this . . listen , Angie . " He started to read the French , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read aloud to in any language , picked up her knitting and began counting stitches . " ' These , then , are the pleasures of the rich , ' " he was reading in English now . ' They pass their days at these things . And meanwhile old Europe dies , weeds are growing in the cracks of the old social order . To-morrow is somber , and the rich are in question in this age as they were in the last . ' " Angie had finished counting . She smiled brightly . " Well , " she said , " I think that 's amusing . " " Angie , " Martin Throop asked patiently , " do n't you grasp what I read ? " She shook her head charmingly and admitted her guilt . Martin closed his eyes , and Angie for a moment thought he was having another spasm of pain from his arthritis . But when he opened his eyes again she knew he was all right , so she went on with her knitting . It was a bright-red scarf to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angie , " Martin said quietly , " I think I must go back to America at once . I am tired of sitting in the sun . There must be something I can do at home . I 'll go into politics  --  something . " She hardly heard him . People were passing , on their way to the pavilion . A dark foreign-looking man slouched down in a seat at the left of them and stared gloomily at the shadows on the ground . An old man in a wheel-chair passed in front of them , pushed by a jaundiced attendant . The two American women got up and left their table . " What did you say ? " Angie asked politely , without any interest . " I said , I am going home , at once , today , if there is a train to Paris this afternoon . " " Home ? " Angie said , suddenly interested . Then she settled back against the hard metal chair and said , with a frown , " I do n't think so , Martin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , do they ? Besides , what 's the point ? What would we do if we did go home ? We 'd just he sitting in the sun in Bar Harbor , instead of here . " " That 's just it , " Martin said testily , " I wo n't be sitting in the sun . I 'll be doing something . I 'll go into politics  --  civilization needs us all in these perilous times . " " Now , Martin , " Angie said soothingly , " you know you hate politics . You 've always said they were dirty . . . and you do n't like President Roosevelt . . . and . . . " " Angela , " Martin said sternly , " apparently I ca n't make you understand how strongly I feel . I am going back patient but , somehow , she could n't seem to rise out of the chair . She said slowly , " Martin , do n't you love me any more ? " He looked as though he were in pain , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , " he said . Then he opened the door and waited politely for her to pass through it . She stood on the platform with him waiting for the train to come in . She was holding the magazines and newspapers she had bought for him at the station kiosk . " You need n't wait , " he said nervously . " The train will be along any minute now . " " But I want to wait , " she said stubbornly . " After all , we 're not really mad at each other , are we ? I mean , we 're still friends . . . " She smiled and patted his arm . The train was rushing into the station . Everyone was getting excited and noisy . " I hope your arthritis gets better , " she shouted , handing him the papers and magazines . " You 'll write and let me know how you are feeling ? " " Yes , yes , of course , " he said . Then he bent down and kissed her cheek . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kiss him . " Good-by , " and then she added quickly , as though it were something she had almost forgotten , " and thank you very much . " She saw the expression of relief on his face , the look of a man who has done a very kind thing . Then she turned and walked rapidly down the platform . In the hotel suite , that was even uglier than before now that she was to occupy it alone ( when you were with somebody else you did n't have time to suffer from shrieking wallpaper and topheavy furniture ) , she sat for a long time , doing nothing . All her life , more or less , her moves had been dictated by someone else , first by her aunt , then by Martin Throop . Now she was supposed to be free , she could go anywhere she liked  --  and she was afraid to move from the chair in that ugly parlor . There was n't any sense , she decided , trying to figure out why after so many years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave her . He had said he had thought about it for a long time , the way he always deliberated his moves , but she had never had an inkling that such thoughts were going on in his head . She did n't feel especially sorry for herself . It was one of Angela 's best traits that she never felt sorry for herself . She was sad about Martin , she missed him . You could be very fond of a person without being in love . She had found that out , to her relief , soon after her marriage . And now they would never have anything to do with each other again . Well , she could n't sit here for the rest of her life . She had to decide where to go , where she wanted to go , where she would have the most fun . She went to the writing desk , because whatever she did would involve writing letters . She would write to somebody and ask if she might visit them . That 's what Martin suggested , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit ? Oh , Lady Benzingham ! Angie put down the pen and bit her lip . She had never dared tell Martin of the time in Paris  --  the last time they had seen Lady B. It had been a large dinner party , very nice people . . . the ladies had left the men at table , and gone into the drawing-room for their coffee . Angie found a chair and sat down , but the rest remained standing by the fireplace , talking to one another . It was like a game , everybody in a huddle and one person left outside , the person who was " It . " After a while she decided to join them , but as she approached , Lady Benzingham , who had been telling a story , stopped in the middle of a sentence , stared at the approaching Angie , and  --  turned her back with a gesture of impatience . Angie had returned to her chair , trying to look unconcerned , a silly smile on her face , until the men joined the ladies . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had told him the nice things Lady Benzing-
