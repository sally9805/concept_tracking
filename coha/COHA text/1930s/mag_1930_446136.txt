FOR more than three years I have thought endlessly of a golden North Alabama summer . I can not get over that season that is now gone , the cabin I lived in on the Warrior River twenty-five miles from Birmingham , the woods , the roads pictured over a variegated landscape , two rivers , my grandfather , and a girl named Halma . Ifanything will bring tears to my eyes it is the thought of the past . The past is close kin to pain , and it is near to happiness . For four months I gadded about with my enthusiastic soul , doing what was best for it . These things I write down , harnessing up the unbacked horses of my brain . And in doing this I can best relive those surpassing hours , that summer half spent with Halma , that season like a wildflower hunt . Not farther from my cabin than a man can throw a stone lived my youngest uncle , though I lived in the woods and in the dark alone when I was in the hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp on inherited land , has a wife good to look at , and a growing boy . When his carpenter , a plug of a man , had finished my cabin , this fine young riverman said to me , ' That cabin would be mighty fine for two . ' There 's not a person among those who knew me well in my home communities but thought I would marry Halma then , thought she was to share the cabin with me . They had no way of knowing that I had for years housed a passion that consumed , that urged , that burned . My creative passion was driving me far and fast . I was secretly living a hard , full life . I did not live in this cabin all the time , only about every other night ; though I was there part of nearly every day for more than three months . The rest of the time I lived in Huey-town with my parents and my sisters and within short walking distance of Halma . Old river settlers used to camp in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long scheduled trips to Old Elyton , Old Jonesboro , ? forerunners of Birmingham and Bessemer respectively , ? and Tuscaloosa . And later it was Hueytown logs which served as heading and fuel to old-timers from the river on their trips to early Birmingham and young Bessemer . And a full history Of the community would tell of the days when almost every old man living there to-day , or else his father , learned to swim in the Warrior River . Hueytown 's good acres were coveted by the rivermen , who cared more about farming than about nature at its best . It must now be passed through in order to reach the city part of Jefferson County from the two Warriors . In truth it is a gateway to the city , the gateway to the rivers . There are two Warriors : the Big Warrior , the Little Warrior ; the Big River , the Little River , the latter emptying into the other about two miles below where I lived in the cabin . It was a cabin built for a secret passion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives Hueytown its name . The place is full of disturbance from the mocking birds in their season . My parents have found in it a place that satisfies . There lives the girl who made life a thing different to me , made it a peeping into a treasure box . For such reasons I think well of the community . ' Fine as a house in Hueytown , ' said an old-timer and Big River man to me once during the summer when speaking of a certain man 's house in another settlement . My heart is always such a dominant part of my life that I am kept full of myself all the time . In the presence of the Warrior River , restfulness flows down my marrow , autumnal calm comes upon me . It is a calm , a long admiration , ever good to think about . Week after week I tied myself anew to these two rivers ; to their hills , their bluffs , their hollows , and their running levels ; to their woods , their birds , their creatures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things with all her strength . Not a day of the aggregation of one hundred did I travel roads riverward without hearing birds singing to one another , or seeing others showing off to one another , ? the redbird is best at this , ? or seeing a rabbit cross in front of me , making , with dawn or dusk and road , a picture ahead of my Ford . I never failed on such an occa- sion to exclaim inwardly , to give silent thanks to the Lord God of beautiful sights and sounds , and startling colors . Oftentimes I exclaimed aloud to another , for Halma companioned me many times . It was a great joy to see my grandfather 's figure , more than that to hear his voice , usually loud . I never failed to be astonished at the thought of the experience that had drained through his distinctly tall and naturally swayed form . During his prime his features were particularly dark , and even yet , when approaching his mid-seventies , gray was partly held at bay . With the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quicker than any one of his five sons , all experts at looking out a gun barrel . His hair was thin and short , and only exactly on top of his head was it practically gone . Without a smooth shave he was fidgety and restless . He was as spry as I was and without my pallor , with a scant ruddiness of face and some haleness of chest , and masterly in bearing . The spectacle of his large , slim form , with its natural sway , walking his immediate premises with his bands to the small of his back , cramming in his shirt tail whenever my grandmother told him to , and tightening his belt about his long body , is one of the best things of my life . To see a somewhat broad black felt hat is to think of him , with his dark clothes and soft collar-attached shirt . I often advanced to him as he hunkered down , looking or studying , and playfully considered the unusual top of his head and his moderately broad forehead which sloped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long nor round . Even when watching him smoke a cigar or take a chew of old-time twist tobacco , drink a dram of whiskey or a bottle of home-brew , 1 realized that I was seeing and knowing an enormous genius . Not once do I recall having seen tobacco stain about his person . His youngest son , Raymond , is one of his two boys most like him in figure and features . My own figure has something of his , but more of my father 's , w hose form is distinctly average , though once rather slender . But my features and favor come from my mother , his : daughter , and from her mother . More than anything else in form , mine is a I line without fleshiness ; more than any ' thing else in features , it is a dark-haired race . And my eyes are gray . It was one Thursday near the middle of June when I made the cabin look good to live in , made it enticing to men who love to sleep alone with the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the attentive ear can hear in Alabama summer woods at night . The furniture had been borrowed from my people , a reading lamp had been given me by Halm . No other cabin that I knew had a reading lamp . However , I did not read , not as much as any one of my uncles did in reading the newspaper . I had books , writing material , a small black trunk , and a homemade table for my business . I only handled the books and nothing more . But those who passed by and noticed doubtless thought that it was the shack of some student . Halma knew better , though I had bashfully kept it from her up to this time . It was yet a few hours before my first night alone in the woods . Supper was to be had with my uncle and his wife . There was nothing to do but loiter about and feel important , important as a wealthy Warrior River landowner . The river was the very place for me , me with all my reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nights by a girl who had the river 's influence and something besides in her great blue eyes . It was good to be alive , better than I had ever known . This girl on my brain and in my marrow , a willowy strip of rapture to me , had brought the bridegroom 's mood into my life . I had a front porch : this porch was built on the ground through a mistake of the codgering carpenter , and my uncle did not like it . This , he said , would cause it to rot . I found that I liked the porch : I could walk right into my house without having to climb steps . My brother-in-law had helped me cut three cedar trees for porch posts from a bluff nearer the mouth of the river . We had a hard time cutting down these young trees , ? trees with a touch of life everlasting about them , ? but it was a hard time we enjoyed . We hauled them up the river with an outboard motor ; and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbranched saplings . Then the carpenter blundered again , sawed the posts too short . He pieced them out with lumber ; and I forced myself to be pleased with the house as a whole , despite the instantaneous anger over the matter of the posts . The cabin was mine for the summer . I resolved in my heart to consider myself an important human being on the Warrior River ? living there , belonging there . That feeling of belonging to such a river , to two such rivers , that I was close to the ultimate with these two rivers , was a peace giver and a pleasure . Time to waste in a delightfully useful way before supper . My cabin faced an old field . When a man in this part of the world turns a field out to the birds and rabbits , and dry cows , persimmon bushes and young pines usually soon take it . There was a patch of small wild persimmon trees not far from my admirable little front porch . I sat on this porch in my good chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for him years ago by an old chair maker across the Big River . The merest passing thought of each little earthy thing made the very fibres of my body thrill and sing . The katydids , I thought , should start their summer singing . They were late . Making such observations inaudibly , I walked out of the porch and into the persimmon thicket , plucked some leaves and bit off their stems . An old habit of mine , an obsession , this biting tender leaf stems . I am always doing some such thing when I idle about . On such occasions everything is wonderfully earthy , as fresh wild-poplar honey is earthy , as the old wine Keats once had in mind was earthy , and I know that the mysteries and the inexplicables are not out of my territory . I went into my room , went in there to try out the cot , to admire the thick red and white coverlet borrowed from my mother . Her father gave it to her when she married , and it had been kept almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as setting eggs are handled in the spring . Then I took to writing down men 's names , the names of my favorite great writers . I thought to myself how I 'd been doing such things for years . The period under the oaks of my high-school grounds was recalled ; the four years under Tuscaloosa 's water oaks were reviewed ; the year under Cambridge elms summoned . I shuddered when I thought how hard it had been to live in the same hull with this tremendous passion as long as I had without doing anything about it . To comfort myself I reflected that not the harmony of verse but a great different harmony of prose was mine , and for this I needed some maturity . Then stepping out upon earth again , sandy soil where my grandfather 's men farmed for fifty years , I faced the cabin and its trees , stood by my Ford , and I knew that the time to do something had come . Afterwards I walked to the boat landing , borrowed a skiff and paddle , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with me , and dry cows and yearlings were sauntering with the dusk under scores of young sycamore trees , trees scaly , slender , smooth . I made my way in a shade as old as the leaves of the sycamores , the sweet gums , and the willows that formed it . In that shade and with that dusk I could not contain all of myself . I was sensitive as a worm is sensitive , and Mabel , my aunt , roused me from it all by calling me to supper . They were waiting for me . At the table sat my uncle , his wife , his growing boy , and his whiskey-drinking carpenter , a man with a very important air . I sat with them , talked with them , and enjoyed a well-cooked , savory meal . The cold supper was made up of new boiled potatoes , large butter beans , homemade mustard dressing , ice-cold clabber milk , cornbread made of water-ground meal , macaroni and cheese , plum pie , pineapple pudding . Raymond said , ' I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good a cook as my wife . My wife 's a pretty good woman . I know that . Only , she wo n't brag on me like she ought to . I 'm a good-looking man , and she was lucky to get me . I could have married up at Short Creek or at most any old home place in Toadvine . She should brag on such a nice man as your old uncle . Little things like that help a man . But if anybody brags on me I 've got to do it myself . ' In my cabin that night I listened for katydids and did not hear them . They were to sing the next night , one of my nights in Hucytown and with Halma ; I was to hear them the next night for the first time . I heard a goat bell and the bleating of a strayed kid across the river . The dark and the woods haunted me to the kernel of my being , took hold of my body and influenced my blood ; but I was inspired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refreshed my brain ; the one to match my passion for the girl , the other to pair with the creative impulse . An outboard motor sped the river . It was whirring towards Birmingport , near where I was born , at the mouth of Short Creek . I was almost asleep when a mocking bird broke loose in a hickory sapling as if everything sweet must be said in a few minutes . I wondered if its song did not contain more good than the early morning song of the bird I had heard in Hueytown that morning . I was saying myself to sleep on Halma 's words of the night before : That part of me that 's higher never has found anything it cares for but you . ' I mused to myself in thoughts to this effect : ' Her figure and voice conserve the attar of the best bird worlds I have known . All of this has been put into a beautiful female being . I have never before seen a girl who in her movements reminds me of the purple martins I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am satisfied that she is the one being yet issued who so adequately compacts the world of the redbirds . She holds at her subtle fingertips all such things . Nowhere else could I find kisses so like the motions and ardor of a redbird . ' All 's deep about me these happy days , deep as the Warrior River , and as placid . In going to the river I had to pass my grandfather 's house , and I stopped there many times . One day I remember I stopped there . It was getting on in June . I was longing for the night song of the katydids , the little green throbs so completely at home in the green world informed by the Warrior . There was my grandmother alone on the well porch . She would talk about them willingly to me . Yes . They were , she said , at it good and proper last night . It 's glad I 'd be , I told her , if they would sing to me when night came . And of course they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without the little noisemakers . I did beat all . She just knew I loved such things more than anybody she ever saw in her life . But , too , she liked to hear them herself . There came then from an old walnut tree near by , ? as I drank cold water from a cedar bucket , water which I had just drawn from a well over one hundred feet deep , ? a tree my mother played under as a child , the day song of the katydid . Not an approach to the night song , but good to hear . Lettving the small seventy-threeyear-old woman with her six walnut trees , her favorite trees because of a long life lived with them , I walked to the front porch where that extraordinary old man sat and watched the public road . Have a chair . I want to talk with you , ' he said . I always like to talk with smart men , ' I replied . Thank you for the compliment . Thank you . Thank you for the compliment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that princess you 're going to marry . I believe you 've found her at last , and I want you to bring her down to sec her old granddaddy . And pay attention to what I say : you 'd better not marry with- out telling me . You just try it . Your grannie wants to see her . She was talking to me about it to-day . Bring her down and you 'll be surprised how well everything will turn out . I had thought that I did n't want you to marry for about five years . I wanted you to wait till you was thirty . But what you do is all right with us . We do n't mind a bit . I do n't know whether there 's any use in waiting or not . You may do better with her than without her . If the pressure 's so great you ca n't stand it , you go on and take her now . I mean that . If it will do to bring her to see us , do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now that 's what I 've got to say about it . Only , do bring the girl down ; we both want to see her more than you can imagine . ' I 've told her about you . She wants to sec such a curiosity . ' Bring her down and let me give her a history of my life . Reckon she 'd run ? ' ' She 's twenty , and a girl . You 'd better tell it to me . ' ' It would take a long time , my young gobbler . . . That sunset , that sunset ! I was riding into one of the finest sunsets of my clays on the earth , riding toward the river , headed for a great bend with its long , beautiful bluff . That bend and its bluff would be an indelible scene for any world traveler at any of the four seasons . I was then considering that bluff as a possible summerhouse place ; it being my grandfather's. land . A heavenly field of myrtle , skirted with purple , was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . From my grandfather 's house I could coast most of the mile to my cabin . What could I do about such beauty ? I coasted along and looked at earth and above earth as at a redbird . As I neared the great bend something happened . A redbird darted across the road ahead of me and flew over the small hills of one of my grand . father 's famous old fields . When Nature wants to show off , when any particular spot needs to be displayed , she sends the rooster redbird darting . It is late dusk at my cabin . I muse to myself that I will reason out a wonderful thing . ' Yes . I have an actual passion for the dusk . What if it should assume the form of a young woman , the likeness of a girl with large eyes ? I once knew a girl who was made up entirely of the dusk , and another made in large part from the dusk . Dusk and beautiful young woman , for all I know , are kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become one sensuous thing , beautiful and wonderful . ' A little later my cars began to take in something from every tree . The woods were full of strange-throated things , things with noisy mouths . That 's all I knew about some of the singers . I recognized the katydids ( in the lead ) , the crickets , a whippoorwill in the distance , tree frogs , river frogs , a whoo owl , a screech owl , and a mocking bird . My grandfather would say , I laugh to myself , that the pressure is too great with that bird . Night , and not dark . The moon makes the old field in front of my cabin light . This land was first settled by one of Halma 's ancestors . Bareheaded , throat open , in love with a girl , hands slinging , hands in pockets , exchanging looks with the heavens , humming an exchange tune with all the katydids , breasting the indelible bend , I walk on a white road that leads through the old field and alongside the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth song , the greenwoods song , the river song of the katydids , and I live only on the earth with them . And the Warrior is the great wonder of that earth . I looked at my watch . By the light of the full moon I saw that it was grow-1 ing late . I was satisfied as with cud . On the return walk to my but I sidled - up to the strip of woodland that bordered the river . This woodland held private cabins , then public shacks . Mine was the fartherest cabin up the river . Then I touched tree after tree to make the katydids stop singing . I had seen it work many times . The resiny piece of throb , wing , and leg never failed to stop short when so much as a forefinger touched its tree . The katydid must have an inviolately natural universe or it will not sing . During that silence I was very familiar with the earth and its beautiful river . And it all came about through my intimacy with the trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A clock is ticking , a clock I bought in Cambridge . I think thick , fast , and full of misses . I muse to myself something after this fashion : ' A splendid rooster redbird crosses the road ahead of me almost every day . That one to-day was large , and overly beautiful . . . yes , it was beautiful as a turtle 's hard . ' IV The feeling of the little road , the intimacy with the trees , the peace of the shade , the inspiration of each other , all these things are ours . She takes my hat . She loved me better , she told me , with my hat off . I could go to these trees and touch them in the dark , and know just exactly which tree I was touching , ' I said . And hush the katydids , ' she replied . . . . There 's no piece of sculpture in the world as beautiful as a poplar 's body . ' We had been stopped by a hollow of poplars . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as beautiful , ' she said , as we passed several fully grown beeches . On down the spring-branch hollow road . Over this road our parents , our grandparents , and our great-grandparents had traveled to mill , to town , to the old meetinghouses , to gatherings ? about their business and their pleasures . They had , we knew , traveled before us on foot , on horseback , in hacks , in surreys , in wagons , and in buggies . This summer we were traveling it all alone . During the whole course of the summer we met only one person on this road , and that person was , I knew , a whiskey maker and a rum runner . Yet the road was in excellent shape and was always shady and altogether rustic . On my grandfather 's road , and we made it last a long time . At the Old School House Place we paused under the great red oak where I had talked with my whiskey-making friend . Hal-ma wondered if he saw us that other day we were under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered her , he only saw two people very much in love . As we drove on I told her that I had often wondered what Hardy would have thought of this road . At the old man 's house I left Halma in the Ford and walked to the back yard to let them know that I would be back by with her . My grandfather was on the back porch , and he had on only his underwear , his socks , and his trousers . He was immensely pleased with what I told him . We neared the river and the sun had set , but the after colors remained . When we lived on the Warrior , I told her , I wanted her to match her dresses with its sunsets . Her face was lavender , just like her dress in color , and they both matched perfectly the colors above the river . She kept her eyes on a large green knoll in the middle of an old field . I had always liked that knoll . Now I would never be able to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After passing by my cabin , where I lived an impassioned life with the katydids , and visiting Raymond and Mabel , where I ate very good suppers and drank very cold water and coca-colas , we drove from the river . The old man was all feeling , and he did practically all of the talking . ' Glad to see you , mighty glad to see you , ' he said as I introduced Halma . ' Have a chair . He 's one of the two or three grandchildren I 've got . I 'm proud of him . When did you-all get married ? ' Hahna was embarrassed . He talked away , and , in his talk , he considered us man and wife . Why were we off together at dark if we were not married ? He 'd like to know that . Halma laughed and smiled , and was confused . I knew that she had met a new kind of human being . My grandmother was on the front porch , too , but the old man filled the darkening scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the well shelter . The old man , I knew , wanted to say a private word or two . While I was gone he talked to Halma about me . As I walked back through the hall towards the front porch , I heard him say , ' He 's funny . But you 'll catch on to him , you 'll soon learn him . ' He talked about his young days and his young wife . ' I loved her so good that I could have swallowed her whole , and I 've wished I had a thousand times since . ' He was in a big way and out for fun . He shifted and continued . ' I was a great friend of your old granddaddy . He was a man of his word . His word was his bond . When that old man told you a thing , you could depend on it . He was a man , not one of these things . I 've always told this boy of mine you 're with to let his word be his bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ever lived . But , in his way , he was one more sight . I 've told this kid lots about him . ' We 'd have to be going , we told them . It was already past dark , and we had to drive to Hueytown . The old man said , ' Come down and stay with us when you do marry , if you 're not already married . We 've got plenty of room , and we 'll try to make you enjoy your stay . You 'll get such a welcome you wo n't forget it soon . . That night we sat in the large room on the davenport she had bought with her own money , money made teaching school . Already it was ours . Late in the night I said , Do you think I 'll ever amount to anything ? ' You do amount to something , ' she said . She consoled me . Yes , ' I said jokingly , ' I 'm quite famous in these parts . Why , I 'm a professor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes hundreds of dollars a month , and he do n't do much work . Best-educated person anywhere in this neck of the woods . Why , he 's been to Harvard . ' We laughed heartily . They have no notion that I do not like to be considered and called a professor . They think it 's a fine thing . You know what I think about it . If you do n't , I can tell you . ' Your grandfather believes in you . And I believe that you can do anything in the world that you want to . I know your ambition , and I believe in you . I do . If you do n't want to teach , I do n't want you to . I want you to be satisfied . My happiness is almost too much for me now . . It was after midnight when I drew water from my father 's well in Huey-town . I made a practice of drawing a fresh bucket every night when I reached home after the date with Halma . Oh , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a hard-pressed mocking bird in a holly tree , another in a magnolia tree . I could not rid myself of Halma 's words : ' You do amount to something . You do . ' I ran on to other words she had said : ' You ' re the only one who has ever courted at this place except those who courted my sisters . And you 're the only one who shall . There 's none else beside you ? and there 's none like you . . . . None like you on earth . .. None besides you . . . . ' She 's beautiful .. . yes . . . beautiful as the two Warriors . .. and as good as the two Warriors . Yes , that 's just it . I 've thought it all out , and that 's the way it is . V My good days have come . Halma and the two Warriors are with me all the time . I roll on the grass under the magnolia tree at home and give thanks to my God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never known comes upon me every time I go off alone and see the Big River . To see the Little River is to be full of peace , the peace that comes to me when I drink from freestone bubbling springs . . . . Always something was happening to touch my life with beauty . Quite often , and at different hours of the day , I would have blithe-hearted encounters with two mocking birds . They were raising what seemed to me a late brood of young singers in a thorn tree on the fence row of our back yard . I would harmlessly bother these birds by walking to the bush and , on tiptoe , looking into the nest . Usually bareheaded , I was careful to guard my eyes against the oncoming floggers . I was always totally passive , and I found out that the mocking bird is an accurate and persistent fighter during the raising season . Upon hearing the fussy sound , I knew immediately to cover my eyes with one arm . Then the bird , sometimes both birds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Before I could reach the back porch the birds would sometimes get three or four dives at the top of my head . Sometimes I stood still under their onslaughts . The mood of the woods went through my body on such occasions , and I gave thanks for every bird dart in the Warrior world that day . It was a sight my mother loved to see and it always made her laugh . My sisters , too , would walk to the back porch or to the swing under the chinaberry tree and a water oak and watch the encounter . I started this affair with the birds by merely wanting to see the young ones . Now a walk in that direction is a challenge to the mockers . My sisters would not brave the attacks ; but my mother would travel the path near the thorn tree , laughing and protecting her face as she hurried along . This morning I amused myself for a long time with a to-do with the birds . The young birds were growing off fast . While this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . She talked to my mother and my sisters about my affair with Halma . There were people in many communities , she said , wondering whether I intended to take her with me to Texas . She just knew before we ever met that we should just suit each other . We were , so her daughter had said , just alike in about every way . At my grandfather 's house I talked with my grandmother and left a dozen rosenears ' for the old man . He was , she said , at the Fork of the River . She was stringing beans , and I helped her string a few . I 'd better come back for supper that night , she said , for Bert Prescott was going to spend the night with them . ' Yes , ' she said , he 's a case . He 's one more sight in this world . ' After a short time the old man came in . He had , he said , just had his nigger driving him around . He 'd just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here tonight for supper . Bert Prescott 's coming here to see me on business and he 's going to spend the night . He 'd tickle a dog , the way he talks , some of the things he says . Bert 's a sight . But I like him . He 's got about a hundred bee gums in his house . Every morning before Bert gets up his room is full of bees . They never sting him . He 's stingy as he can be away from home . He wo n't spend a nickel in town if he can get out of it . But go to his house , and he 'll treat you like a governor . He 's got plenty of honey , molasses , meat , lard , canned goods , and everything else . He always does have . He 's a Bert . You come on up here for supper . It does look like you could stay for dinner . ' . . . At my cabin I had a long time alone . I pulled persimmon leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit their stems , and tried to choose between the two . Then I bit grass stalks , pulled the stalks and enjoyed doing it , and dropped the seed part on an old wagon road as I meddled along to the river . At the river I pulled sweet gum leaves and bit the stems . For beauty of leaf and stem they have few equals , and they are better for biting than most other leaf stems . But there is a taste about them that I do not like . I walked back to the cabin , and as I walked I gathered poplar leaves , and I gathered pink and red leaves from the black gum tree where my little alarm birds roosted . On my porch I sat and studied the colors in my hand , felt the coldness of the poplar leaves against my face . A grasshopper sang his song of nonsense and nothing in the wild clover in front of my cabin . There was nothing to that noise , but I liked to hear it well enough . . . . Mabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beans and meat for dinner , and I clerked for myself in the fishing-camp store . Then I played light-hearted pieces on the victrola . As I heard the records , I looked at the river through the screen wire , pranced to the tunes , snapped my fingers from a hummer 's mood , and talked with Mabel . . . . I walked under great red oaks and poplars at my grandfather 's cow lot and old gin lot . And in the deepening dusk I strolled a path to a spring , and the katydids drowned the whole woods world and smothered my being with their dusk song . Suddenly the whole above woods was black , and lightning bolted towards the great poplars above the spring . I hurried to the house and found my grandfather and Bert Prescott at the two long water shelves washing for the supper table . We walked to the back screened porch and sat down for the night meal . My grandmother poured milk and coffee , said she was not hungry but might eat a bite later on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did likewise . A great rain was falling . The old poplar tree outside the porch had ceased to drip and the whole rain was falling through . The katydid song had stopped short for the night . The carbide lights were burning , and Bert said that he could tell who I was by the favor . I studied the small , dried-up , dark bachelor from across the Little River . Well , Bert , ' the old man said , ' it 's a wonder in this part of the world for you to stay away from home a night , ai n't it ? ' Yes , Lat , this is the first time I 've stayed away at night for several years . I 've lost count . I thought I 'd better saneter over here while my brother was there to look after the place and tend to the things . ' Bert , old-timer that he was , ate grease and sugar with his biscuits , though the table was full of good things to eat . And , though he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eating honeycomb . A large platter was full of home-cured ham , and it was sweet and very good , but hard . I had trouble cutting my ham with a dull case knife . Bert said , ' I 've got an old butcher knife at home that 'll cut like hell . I keep it on the table and use it . ' The drawl to his words was as singular as the content . Bert , ' the old man said , ' there 's a fine red bull that stays over here . I seed him to-day . Raymond says he 's yours : Yes . I 'm going to sell him . ' ' A brute like that 's valuable to a settlement , Bert . ' Yes , you 're just right about that . I guess I could keep him . I do n't want to kill him if he 's going to help anybody . ' Cindy 's got a Jersey cow with twin heifers , and they 're the prettiest things you ever seed . She likes them so well she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . ' She has ? I 'd like to see them . ' Yes , you must see them in the morning . ' ' I allus let my calves suck lots of milk . They grow off as quick again . Damned if they do n't . ' ' I do n't need much milk even if I do nearly live on sweet milk . I turn my calves to it and let joy go with them . By God , that 's the way to raise a calf . Oh , hell yes . ' My grandfather said to me , ' Bert cans more things and fixes up for winter more than most women . You just ought to see what he 's got at his house . ' Well , Lat , I sure have got a good place , and if I ca n't make a good living on it by myself , I 'm just not worth a ' sarned damn . I 've got a whole passel of cowcumbers put up , and they 'll be mighty fine when I kill hogs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my kitchen floor 's so full I ca n't get about in it well . And my hall 's full . Yes , my porch is full of bee gums . ' What kind of a man is it that do n't want a smokehouse ? Every old-timer does . But the smokehouse here belongs to Cindy , and the cellar 's mine . I 've got the best cellar in this country . Everybody knows that . ' ' I 'm just of the opinion you are . ' ' Bert , have you got many hogs in the woods ? ' Yes , the woods is just full of them . I 'm going to get shut of them-a . It 's too hard work , and it takes so bygodded much of my time . What in the name of hell fuzzy do I need with a river bend full of hogs ? ' Bert , you just work all the time , do n't you ? ' Yes , Let , I keep busy all the time . I saw and split stove wood and split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form thing to do . I 've got all the shacks on the place full of stove wood and fodder . I 've got some fodder fifteen years old . Well , I believe I like the old holler black gum better than anything else for my bees . I 've got all kinds of gums . Doust if I ai n't cut about every holler black gum tree on my section of land . I had to hunt a long time before I could find the last tree I cut . ' Bert , you 've got a great outlet for stock there where you live . Have you got any goats and sheep ? ' I 've got a hundred or more damned old goats up the Big River on the bluffs . I would n't stand them anywhere around my fields . Hell fuzzy , I do n't need the damned old goats . And they stink like hell . They can turn to pine knots on the bluff ' for all I care . I used to keep a lot of sheep , but the low-clown dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always kept a gang . ' The downpour has ceased and it is raining gently . Thick clouds make the night dark . Carbide lights are burning on every porch and in the kitchen . Come on around to the front porch , Bert . I believe we 'll set there instead of here on the back porch or the well shelter . Hal , bring you one of the chairs you like to set in . We 're going to talk . ' Settled comfortably on the front porch , the road a few steps away , I do as the old man , prop my feet on the banisters . I look out on the obscured earth and listen . Bert 's feet are not propped up . My grandmother has remained in the back part of the house . Bert , ' the old man began , ' you 're not old and doty . You 're still in your prime . Do you ever think of marry-ing ? ' There ai n't no use to buy a cow when you can get all the sweet milk you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth keeping up , the majority of them ai n't . They are pretty near all so by-godded I just wo n't fool with one long at a time . ' The drip of the house denotes peace . The breath we breathe is refreshing . The chairs we lean back in are comfortable . Lat , Milly Macmillan is one of the few old-time girls left . Let me tell you she 's a good cook and as good a housekeeper as ever lived . Her house stays as clean as new ashes . ' The old man had told me that he expected Bert and Milly to marry when her old father died . She lived alone with him in a great hollow of beeches a mile or two from Bert 's house . That Bert . He is mightily drawn toward woman . She is a loadstone to him . Yes , that 's what she is to Bert . A man made by the woods , a man made in the woods , a man grown peculiar by much solitude . Solitude has made him think strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a properly subdued man of the woods , but nevertheless a ball of fire when woman is around his bed or on his paths . An automobile passed in a drizzle of rain going toward the river . A voice we did not recognize called , ' Hello , Uncle Lat ! ' The old man said , Bert , we ought to think a lot of our woods . What would we be without them ? We would n't have a bit of sense . And our rivers , the Big River and the Little River , what would we be without them ? We would n't have much peace without them . And what would our country be ? Just take the second thought . ' I 'm just of the opinion you are on that . ' When I get ready to die , ' the old man said , ' I wish I could change a little and go off in these woods around here and get lost , and drink branch and creek and spring water , and sleep on the roots of beech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , and eat leaves and live on what the animals and birds do for a thousand years . It 'd take that long and that kind of a life and my mind to learn all about these woods . But I would n't be satisfied without a woman . I 'd want a young woman with me part of the time . A woman with that kind of a career would get wise , would n't she ? No wonder young women do n't know no more than they do , the kind of lives they have to lead . A woman with me that long and young all the time would be wise when I got through with her under any conditions . And I 'd like to go to the Big River and the Little River of nights . Just think what it would mean to go to the river bank with the foxes , and the groundhogs , and the minks , and the muskrats , and the coons , and the weasels , and the who() owls , and the scrootch owls , and everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day we could take out after the redbirds and keep right with them and learn to live like they do . A man could amount to something if he had the time . We 've certainly got the place here . Why , if it was that way there 'd be other couples around in the woods and on the paths we could meet when we wanted to . Looks like the Lord would try things out that way : have , say , me to test out the way of life I 'm talking about and give me time , and give some other man the chance and time to try out some other good way of life . Of course you both know I 'm mostly just talking . But I think this would be as good or better than the scheme we now live and die by . Why , I 'd be content to just go around and look at my part of the world and do nothing else for a thousand years . If I could think it 's beautiful once a day and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enough to live for . ' I 'm just of the opinion you are . And I 'd a whole hell of a lot rather do that , for I know things here , than to go to the good place the preachers talk about . And I 'm just of the opinion you are about hell . I do n't believe in such bosh . ' Another automobile passed on the wet road headed for the river . A second voice the old man did not recognize called out , ' Hello , Mr. Lis-per ! ' Tree frogs were hollering for more rain , for the rain had ceased , and the old man carried on the talk . Bert , do you know what woman you 'd like to spend a thousand years , or eternity , with in these woods ? If I ask you for the truth , will you tell me ? Well , who 's the sweetest , best woman ? I mean woman ? you ever fooled with ? ' Hildy ' s the sweetest woman I ever touched . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy . ' Give ? me a slim woman or no woman at all . Now , without any foolishness . I 'm serious now . This boy of mine here says his woman 's as slender as a young poplar and always will be . She was down here with him the other day nearly at night , but it was so dark I could n't see her . And I forgot to strike a match . But if she 's slim like that , she 'll be worth her weight in gold to him . I mean that . I 'd say that on a stack of Bibles . I know women . I would n't have a fat , chumpy girl . When I see a young man marrying one , I shake my head to myself , for I know he 's not getting much . They 're just like logs . ' Yes , that reminds me , ' said Bert . That Josie was the sorriest woman I ever had dealings with . If she 's the one I had to spend a lOng time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some other place and walk city streets . And I certainly had rather live in these woods than go to any city to stay , no matter how golden it might be . Why , I do n't like to stay in Birmingham twenty-four hours . It might be different in some ways . But there 'd be too many people to suit me . I would n't want to be scrouged up . Right now I just would n't live in the city twenty-four hours . Oh , hell no . If there 's anything I like it 's elbowroom . I would n't sell any of my land on that account . No , I do n't want to be scrouged up . Doust if I do . ' Well , Bert , when you 're dead , you 're dead for a long time . I know how it is . I think I do . They 'll put me down in the red sandstone of my land , though it 's white on top and blue deep down . When I 've been in my red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out the finest red oak or water oak that can be found right about on my grave , and let it feed on me . I 'll be there in the sandstone , and I 'd like to get back in the open air through a tree like that oak in the old gin lot . And if the generations would be kind and knowing enough some oak tree could feed on my grave as long as there are oak trees hem . ' And the end of it all with me will be that I 'll be dead and in the ground under the pines and dogwoods there on my place , by the side of my old daddy and ma , for a long time . I 'm like you . I believe that when you 're dead , you ' re dead for a long time . ' I drove to my cabin in the night and left the two men in a business conversation .
