txt Gross Irregularities and defects In the construction of the city 's new $12,000,000 prison on Rikers Island , such as cracked walls , sinking foundations and improper plumbing , as reported by Commissioner of Accounts Paul Blanshard , caused Controller W. Arthur Cunningham to hold up last night all payments to contractors . The Controller 's action followed the submission by Mr. Blanshard of his report to the Mayor , a report in which he charged irregularities and abuses both to the contractors and to the architects . He urged that payments be held up and he suggested , too , that Corporation Counsel Paul Windels look into the matter and determine whether the city should sue the contractors and the architects . Submits Higgins Reports . Along with his own report Mr. Blanshard submitted reports made over the last three years by his predecessor , James A. Higgins , to the Controller of the old regime and to the Correction Department . In these reports , which were pigeonholed , Mr. Higgins repeatedly called attention to flaws in construction of the prison and to evasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the reports , although Mr. Higgins several times recommended that payments to contractors and architects be suspended . Mr. Blanshard named the architects , Sloan and Robertson , as those chiefly responsible for the way in which the prison had been built , although the plumbing contractor , Edward V. , also received strong censure . As a matter of fact , Mr. Higgins 's reports were even severer than that given to the Mayor by Mr. Blanshard . The Higgins report , the new commissioner said , gave him much valuable information with which to carry on the brief inquiry which resulted in the submission to the Mayor of the arraignment of the , methods of constructing the prison . ? Mr. Blanshard said construction of the new prison was about 95 per cent completed , and that upward of 90 per cent of the total contract awards to the builders had been paid . It was because as large a percentage had been paid , he indicated , that he felt it might be best for the city to institute suits against the architects and builders to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Blanshard said in his report , " were designated in 1929 as the architects for this work without any competition either open or restricted , and no attempt was made on the part of the city to call for competitive contracts from outstanding architects . The city 's $5,000,000 contract with the P. J. Carlin Construction Company the general contractors has been clearly violated in a number of particulars , with a probable loss to the taxpayers of more than $100,000 . Many changes in specifications have been made which are questionable . The reports of the engineers of this department working under former Commissioner James A. Higgins show that Sloan and Robertson have not given the project proper supervision . " Cites the Prison Wall . The original prison plans , he said , provided for a concrete wall around the prison to be built on pile foundations , but the wall was eliminated from the plans , the city accepting a $160,000 credit from the Carlin firm . According to engineers of the Accounts Department , the commissioner said , the city should have received a $234,000 credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers , he stated , put the credit at $215,000 , but " nevertheless , the former Controller tentatively accepted the $160,000 credit . " Brick work is below specifications , Mr. Blanshard said . The contract called for weather joints for all face brick work , he pointed out , but Sloan &; Robertson , " without departmental approval , " he said , arbitrarily changed this to a rough cut flush joint , with a resultant saving of from $14,000 to $21 , Q00 to the contractor . Mr. Blanshard urged that the Finance Department hold the contractor responsible " not only for the cash difference in the cost of the two grades of brick work but also for any subsequent leaking conditions in the walls . " " Many serious cracks have al1 ready appeared in the structures , " the report stated . " The whole project has been handled with such neg1lect of taxpayers ' rights that numerous change orders have been given to the contractors for questionable reasons at an excessive additional cost , or insufficient credit allowed the city . Sees Bad Bargain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Robertson and the city is obviously a very bad bargain for the city . The total fee will be over $700,000 , and this is outrageously high . In view of the lack of supervision noted in this report , I recommend that a thorough study be made of the portion of this contract which now grants to Sloan &; Robertson 23 per cent ' additional cumulative compensation ' on auxiliary equipment , since the phrasing in the contract is so vague that the firm may take advantage of the taxpayers . " Mr. , the plumbing contractor , Mr. Blanshard stated , " has repeatedly violated his contract with the city in failing to observe specifications . " This contractor , more than any other individual , the commissioner asserted , is responsible " for the great delay in the completion of the project . " Because of the contractor 's failure to live up to specifications , he reported , many of the prison pipe lines had been lying exposed in open trenches for more than a year . This delay , he said , would unquestionably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . Asks Suspension of Payments . " In view of these facts , " stated Mr. Blanshard , " I wish to unite with Mr. Walter E. Nutt , the Acting Chief Engineer of the Finance Department , and his assistant , Nathan Epstein , and with two engineers of the Department of Accounts , Jacob Thoma and Louis Rabinowitz , in recommending to the Finance Department that no further payments be made on general contracts for the Rikers Island Penitentiary buildings until the responsibility for defective work is definitely determined and until the work is corrected which is not in conformity with contracts and specifications . " The first of the Higgins reports was dated Feb. 9 , 1931 , a short time after the construction of the prison was begun . In it Mr. Higgins questioned whether the architects were entitled even to the customary 5 per cent fee , to say nothing of the additional 2 and one-half per cent . He deplored , I , too , the fact that the firm , although recognized as a leader in its field , should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and costly project the best interests of the city demanded that the architectural contract be thrown open to competition , he held . In the second report Mr. Higgins listed the five contractors and the amount of their contracts as follows : P. J. Carlin Construction Co. , general construction $5,340 , T13 Erickson Equipment Co. , power plant 237.400 Edward V. plumbing 852,000 Charles H. Darmstadt , Inc. , heating , ventilation and refrigeration 550,000 Arc Electrical Consturctlon Co 448,400 He cited specific flaws in the prison buildings , as cracks in the walls , in the foundations and in the piers , due , apparently to unequal settlement . This in turn , he stated , might have been due to improperly driven piles , improper design of the foundations or a sinking of the garbage and ash fill , on which the prison is being built . Mr. Higgins also charged the substitution of lower grade brick joint from that called for in the specifications , stating it had already resulted in leaks and much weathering and would lead to rapid depreciation of the prison buildings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from specifications , he reported . Blames Architects . " Most of the serious faults and defects found on the work may be laid to the architects , Sloan &; Robertson , and the several contractors may not be held entirely responsible for the same , " Mr. Higgins stated in this report , which was dated Jan. 17 , 1933 . His next report , submitted Nov. 3 , 1933 , stated that additional cracks had developed in the prison buildings . He criticized the attitude of the firm , which , he said , refused to take orders from any one but the architects and consequently did nothing about unspecified pipe they had laid , piping which the Department of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity refused to approve . " During the course of our inspections and examinations of the records and the specifications which Mr. Higgins subpoenaed it has become apparent to us that the architects , Sloan and Robertson , have not been giving the city the advantage of their expert knowledge and advice , " the report declared . " In many instances they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As one of his last public acts , Mr. Higgins prepared a final report on the prison , dated Jan. 5 , 1934 , which he handed over to Mr. Blanshard . In It he reviewed the earlier re ports and added , as the opinion of his department that much more consideration should have been given to a site for the new prison before Rikers Island was decided upon . He said in this final report that there had been a lack of proper inspection and supervision of the prison construction not only by the architects but by the city department involved . In closing he renewed his attack upon the architects . " Our opinion is that the architects did not fulfill their part of the contract in reference to supervision and inspection of the work , " , the report stated . " All the contractors have received periodic extensions of time . Each contractor blames the other contractors for delays caused on their work . None of the penalties provided in the contracts for failure to complete the work within the time specified have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
