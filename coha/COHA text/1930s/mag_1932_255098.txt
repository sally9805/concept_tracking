Snip , the previous Cairn , was an affectionate beast who whimpered outside the royal bedroom all the time King George lay gravely ill three years ago , and accompanied His Majesty to almost everything except the state openings of Parliament . Snip died in April . Mourned by the royal household and the nation , he was buried in Sandringham by the side of Edward VII 's dog Caesar who had the distinction of preceding the Kaiser at his master 's funeral . <P> All summer King George remained petless except for Charlotte the parrot . Parrot Charlotte is a 40-year-old bird that H. M. bought in Port Said when he was in the navy .

Edward of Wales has a Cairn too , a snappy little bitch named Cora.
